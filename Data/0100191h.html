<h2>Two Hanged Women<br>
<br>
by<br>
<br>
Henry Handel Richardson</h2>

<hr>

<p>Hand in hand the youthful lovers sauntered along the esplanade.
It was a night in midsummer; a wispy moon had set, and the stars
glittered. The dark mass of the sea, at flood, lay tranquil,
slothfully lapping the shingle.</p>

<p>"Come on, let's make for the usual," said the boy.</p>

<p>But on nearing their favourite seat they found it occupied. In
the velvety shade of the overhanging sea-wall, the outlines of two
figures were visible.</p>

<p>"Oh, blast!" said the lad. "That's torn it. What now, Baby?"</p>

<p>"Why, let's stop here, Pincher, right close up, till we frighten
'em off."</p>

<p>And very soon loud, smacking kisses, amatory pinches and
ticklings, and skittish squeals of pleasure did their work.
Silently the intruders rose and moved away.</p>

<p>But the boy stood gaping after them, open-mouthed.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm <i>damned!</i> If it wasn't just two hanged
women!"</p>

<p>Retreating before a salvo of derisive laughter, the elder of the
girls said: "We'll go out on the break-water." She was tall and
thin, and walked with a long stride.</p>

<p>Her companion, shorter than she by a bobbed head of straight
flaxen hair, was hard put to it to keep pace. As she pegged along
she said doubtfully, as if in self-excuse: "Though I really ought
to go home. It's getting late. Mother will be angry."</p>

<p>They walked with finger-tips lightly in contact; and at her
words she felt what was like an attempt to get free, on the part of
the fingers crooked in hers. But she was prepared for this, and
held fast, gradually working her own up till she had a good half of
the other hand in her grip.</p>

<p>For a moment neither spoke. Then, in a low, muffled voice, came
the question: "Was she angry last night, too?"</p>

<p>The little fair girl's reply had an unlooked-for vehemence. "You
know she wasn't!" And, mildly despairing: "But you never
<i>will</i> understand. Oh, what's the good of...of anything!"</p>

<p>And on sitting down she let the prisoned hand go, even putting
it from her with a kind of push. There it lay, palm upwards, the
fingers still curved from her hold, looking like a thing with a
separate life of its own; but a life that was ebbing.</p>

<p>On this remote seat, with their backs turned on lovers, lights,
the town, the two girls sat and gazed wordlessly at the dark sea,
over which great Jupiter was flinging a thin gold line. There was
no sound but the lapping, sucking, sighing, of the ripples at the
edge of the breakwater, and the occasional screech of an owl in the
tall trees on the hillside.</p>

<p>But after a time, having stolen more than one side-glance at her
companion, the younger seemed to take heart of grace. With a
childish toss of the head that set her loose hair swaying, she
said, in a tone of meaning emphasis: "I like Fred."</p>

<p>The only answer was a faint, contemptuous shrug.</p>

<p>"I tell you I <i>like</i> him!"</p>

<p>"Fred? Rats!"</p>

<p>"No it isn't...that's just where you're wrong, Betty. But you
think you're so wise. Always."</p>

<p>"I know what I know."</p>

<p>"Or imagine you do! But it doesn't matter. Nothing you can say
makes any difference. I like him, and always shall. In heaps of
ways. He's so big and strong, for one thing: it gives you such a
safe sort of feeling to be with him...as if nothing could happen
while you were. Yes, it's...it's...well, I can't help it, Betty,
there's something <i>comfy</i> in having a boy to go about
with&mdash;like other girls do. One they'd eat their hats to get,
too! I can see it in their eyes when we pass; Fred with his great
long legs and broad shoulders&mdash;I don't nearly come up to
them&mdash;and his blue eyes with the black lashes, and his shiny
black hair. And I like his tweeds, the Harris smell of them, and
his dirty old pipe, and the way he shows his teeth&mdash;he's got
<i>topping</i> teeth&mdash;when he laughs and says
'ra-<i>ther</i>!' And other people, when they see us, look...well I
don't quite know how to say it, but they look sort of pleased; and
they make room for us and let us into the dark corner-seats at the
pictures, just as if we'd a right to them. And they never laugh.
(Oh, I can't <i>stick</i> being laughed at!&mdash;and that's the
truth.) Yes, it's so comfy, Betty darling...such a warm cosy comfy
feeling. Oh, <i>won't</i> you understand?"</p>

<p>"Gawd! why not make a song of it?" But a moment later, very
fiercely: "And who is it's taught you to think all this? Who's
hinted it and suggested it till you've come to believe
it?...believe it's what you really feel."</p>

<p>"She hasn't! Mother's never said a word...about Fred."</p>

<p>"Words?&mdash;why waste words?...when she can do it with a cock
of the eye. For your Fred, that!" and the girl called Betty held
her fingers aloft and snapped them viciously. "But your mother's a
different proposition."</p>

<p>"I think you're simply horrid."</p>

<p>To this there was no reply.</p>

<p>"<i>Why</i> have you such a down on her? What's she ever done to
you?...except not get ratty when I stay out late with Fred. And I
don't see how you can expect...being what she is...and with nobody
but me&mdash;after all she <i>is</i> my mother...you can't alter
that. I know very well&mdash;and you know, too&mdash;I'm not
<i>too</i> putrid-looking. But"&mdash;beseechingly&mdash;"I'm
<i>nearly</i> twenty-five now, Betty. And other girls...well, she
sees them, every one of them, with a boy of their own, even though
they're ugly, or fat, or have legs like sausages&mdash;they've only
got to ogle them a bit&mdash;the girls, I mean...and there they
are. And Fred's a good sort&mdash;he is, really!&mdash;and he
dances well, and doesn't drink, and so...so why <i>shouldn't</i> I
like him?...and off my own bat...without it having to be all
Mother's fault, and me nothing but a parrot, and without any will
of my own?"</p>

<p>"Why? Because I know her too well, my child! I can read her as
you'd never dare to...even if you could. She's sly, your mother is,
so sly there's no coming to grips with her...one might as well try
to fill one's hand with cobwebs. But she's got a hold on you, a
stranglehold, that nothing'll loosen. Oh! mothers aren't
fair&mdash;I mean it's not fair of nature to weigh us down with
them and yet expect us to be our own true selves. The handicap's
too great. All those months, when the same blood's running through
two sets of veins&mdash;there's no getting away from that, ever
after. Take yours. As I say, does she need to open her mouth? Not
she! She's only got to let it hang at the corners, and you reek,
you drip with guilt."</p>

<p>Something in these words seemed to sting the younger girl. She
hit back. "I know what it is, you're jealous, that's what you
are!...and you've no other way of letting it out. But I tell you
this. If ever I marry&mdash;yes, <i>marry</i>!&mdash;it'll be to
please myself, and nobody else. Can, you imagine me doing it to
oblige her?"</p>

<p>Again silence.</p>

<p>"If I only think what it would be like to be fixed up and
settled, and able to live in peace, without this eternal dragging
two ways...just as if I was being torn in half. And see Mother
smiling and happy again, like she used to be. Between the two of
you I'm nothing but a punch-ball. Oh, I'm fed up with it!...fed up
to the neck. As for you... And yet you can sit there as if you were
made of stone! Why don't you <i>say</i> something? <i>Betty!</i>
Why won't you speak?"</p>

<p>But no words came.</p>

<p>"I can <i>feel</i> you sneering. And when you sneer I hate you
more than any one on earth. If only I'd never seen you!"</p>

<p>"Marry your Fred, and you'll never need to again."</p>

<p>"I will, too! I'll marry him, and have a proper wedding like
other girls, with a veil and bridesmaids and bushels of flowers.
And I'll live in a house of my own, where I can do as I like, and
be left in peace, and there'll be no one to badger and bully
me&mdash;Fred wouldn't...ever! Besides, he'll be away all day. And
when he came back at night, he'd...I'd I mean I'd&mdash;&mdash;"
But here the flying words gave out; there came a stormy breath and
a cry of: "Oh, Betty, Betty!...I couldn't, no, I couldn't! It's
when I think of <i>that</i>...Yes, it's quite true! I like him all
right, I do indeed, but only as long as he doesn't come too near.
If he even sits too close, I have to screw myself up to bear
it"&mdash;and flinging herself down over her companion's lap, she
hid her face. "And if he tries to touch me, Betty, or even takes my
arm or puts his round me....And then his face...when it looks like
it does sometimes all wrong...as if it had gone all wrong&mdash;oh!
then I feel I shall have to scream&mdash;out loud. I'm afraid of
him...when he looks like that. Once...when he kissed me...I could
have died with the horror of it. His breath ...his breath...and his
mouth&mdash;like fruit pulp&mdash;and the black hairs on his
wrists...and the way he looked&mdash;and...and everything! No, I
can't, I can't...nothing will make me...I'd rather die twice over.
But what am I to do? Mother'll <i>never</i> understand. Oh, why has
it got to be like this? I want to be happy, like other girls, and
to make her happy, too...and everything's all wrong. You tell me,
Betty darling, you help me, you're older...you <i>know</i>...and
you can help me, if you will...if you only will!" And locking her
arms round her friend she drove her face deeper into the warmth and
darkness, as if, from the very fervour of her clasp, she could draw
the aid and strength she needed.</p>

<p>Betty had sat silent, unyielding, her sole movement being to
loosen her own arms from her sides and point her elbows outwards,
to hinder them touching the arms that lay round her. But at this
last appeal she melted; and gathering the young girl to her breast,
she held her fast.&mdash;And so for long she continued to sit, her
chin resting lightly on the fair hair, that was silky and downy as
an infant's, and gazing with sombre eyes over the stealthily
heaving sea.</p>
