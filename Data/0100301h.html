<h2>Here's Another<br>
<br>

<hr>

<h2>THE LAST OF THE THOMASES</h2>

<p>There was a man named Thomas. There generally is. His surname
was Thomas, and his Christian name was Thomas, so his full name was
Thomas Thomas.</p>

<p>This is very peculiar.</p>

<p>Thomas's family tree had been ringbarked at his father's death,
for Thomas was not married, and he was the last descendant of an
honorable family. It looked as if the family could not descend any
further.</p>

<p>His father died in very romantic circumstances. He sprained his
ankle in Macquarie Street, and a young doctor, seeing him fall,
ordered him into hospital and operated on him for appendicitis, so
successfully, that he died a martyr to science.</p>

<p>On his father's death, Thomas became an orphan, because his
mother had died some months before he was born. He graduated as an
orphan quite easily.</p>

<p>Thanks to the commonsense laws of this country, all that was
necessary for him to become a qualified orphan was that both, or
all, of his parents should be dead.</p>

<p>Poor Thomas was cast out into the cruel world to earn his own
living. No one can realise the horrors of this unless they have had
to earn their own living themselves, so it is no use trying to
explain.</p>

<p>It was a bit hot on him, being cast out into the world,
though.</p>

<p>With tears in his eyes he watched the landlord kick the door in
and seize the furniture his poor old mother had made when she was a
girl. Sadly he locked the landlord in, and set fire to the house,
and then started out for the cold, hard city.</p>

<p>He had nothing, not even a cat. Not a solitary bell tolled him
to come back and be a Lord Mayor.</p>

<p>Going along the road, he struck a kindhearted motorist, who gave
him a lift. Or, rather, the motorist struck him. He was lifted
about eight feet.</p>

<p>He continued on his way, and at last, after many vicissitudes
too numerous to mention, entered the city on his hands and
knees.</p>

<p>As he was crawling along in the gutter, a big man in a motor car
sliced his ear off with the mudguard, and then, pulling up, greeted
him with a hearty laugh.</p>

<p>"I can see by your attitude," he said, "that you are looking for
work. You look miserable enough to work for practically
nothing.</p>

<p>"I might employ you.</p>

<p>"How long is it since you've had a meal?"</p>

<p>"Three weeks," said Thomas.</p>

<p>That was a lie, as he had only been without food for two weeks.
Which just shows you the low cunning of some people.</p>

<p>But the kind gentleman did not suspect that he was being imposed
upon, and he smiled and gently patted Thomas with his foot.</p>

<p>"Hang on to the spare tyre of my car," he said. "I will take you
with me."</p>

<p>And so Thomas arrived at the ancestral halls of the kind
gentleman, luxuriously hanging on to the spare tyre.</p>

<p>The kind gentleman, who was a retired alderman and very wealthy,
allowed him to sleep in the garage, and at first he was bewildered
by the luxury which surrounded him, but after a while he got used
to it and became more refined.</p>

<p>Thomas progressed rapidly in his master's favor, and after a few
months he was doing all the jobs about the place, and the master
was able to sack all the servants, including the chauffeur,
gardener and the confidential secretary.</p>

<p>Thomas was an ambitious young man, and at 3 a.m., after he had
finished his work, he spent the two hours of leisure remaining to
him, not in sleep, but in study.</p>

<p>He studied so hard that soon he knew the past form of every
horse in the State.</p>

<p>Then the devil tempted him. He embezzled 40 pounds of the kind
gentleman's money and went to the races.</p>

<p>The same fate overtook him as has overtook many another who has
heeded Satan's promptings.</p>

<p>He won 4000 pounds.</p>

<p>Returning to his place of employment, he assaulted the kind
gentleman who had befriended him. The kind gentleman never
recovered, and, although the police were a bit suspicious, they
never did anything to Thomas, as a man with 20,000 pounds (it was a
three-day race meeting) would never do such a thing. At least that
is what the police thought, but then the police are very dense
sometimes.</p>

<p>Sir Thomas (for such he was by this time) soon became known far
and wide for his good works, and there were more special inquiries
held on his doings than any other gentleman in the land. His name
became a household word and many people were arrested for saying
the word in public.</p>

<p>But Sir Thomas died. Strange to say, died in an even more
romantic way than father. Driving his car one day, he had been
chasing a pedestrian, and at last, tiring of the sport, he ran over
him.</p>

<p>The pedestrian had a bottle in his pocket.</p>

<p>The tyre burst, and Sir Thomas was flung out of the car with
such force that he spread all over the wall of a nearby
building.</p>

<p>When the horrified bystanders scraped him off, he was dead.</p>

<p>So ended the last of the Thomases.</p>

<p>Let this story be a lesson to you, gentle and somewhat dull
reader. No matter what people may say, no matter how you are
tempted&mdash;never be an orphan.</p>

<h2>PERILS OF THE BATHTUB</h2>

<p>What's a bath between friends? Nothing but a hollow porcelain
division. Who invented baths? Some dirty cow.</p>

<p>ONLY dirty people bathe, as the Prophet hath said. Those who are
not dirty, and yet bathe, do it out of pure flashness.</p>

<p>These thoughts are engendered by the recent law enacted by the
Home Minister of Poland, wherein it is enacted (we like "wherein it
is enacted"; it has a partly gold watch-chained, bald-headed sound
about it) that every Pole must bathe at least once a month.</p>

<p>Those under 10 and over 60 are exempt, also those possessing
their own bathrooms, which, it is presumed, are used.</p>

<p>Bathrooms in Poland are sufficient evidence in a case of Rex v.
Perspiration.</p>

<p>Some similar action is needed in Australia. Such as:&mdash;</p>

<p>Act 79B, sub-section K2, Z1, relating to bathing of bodies: "Be
it heretofor whereas'd that inasmuch &amp; so to speak, any person
or persons turning on showers between or about the months of May,
June, July, &amp; standing near shaving cabinets, well away from
showers, &amp; saying, 'Br-r-r-r!' &amp; singing 'Annie Laurie'
afterward coming out of bathroom, or rooms, &amp; saying that there
is nothing like a cold shower to freshen one up, shall be fined a
maximum of 10 pounds or a fortnight. God Save King."</p>

<p>This will be one of the planks of the new Ruination Party, of
which we have the honour of being president.</p>

<p>Any man who does more than bathe his eyes in this weather should
be in a monastery. And, anyhow, what advantage has the bather?</p>

<p>He comes from his cold shower, blue, numb, speechless. At his
office he says, "My word, the shower was cold this morning!"</p>

<p>And the man who wiped his eyes on a wet sponge says, "One of the
toughest surfs I've experienced this winter. All the Icebergs
agreed."</p>

<p>Let there be signs put up in all bathrooms similar to those on
various beaches, "Any person bathing here does so at his own
risk."</p>

<p>S.O.S.: Not, Shiver Our Skins&mdash;but Save Our Soap.</p>

<p>Men have been known to slip on a cake of soap and break their
necks.</p>

<p>Be warned.</p>

<h2>WHAT BREAD IS AND HOW TO USE IT</h2>

<p>About bread. Bread is a large number of small holes entirely
surrounded by bread.</p>

<p>A SIMPLE recipe for using it is to lay down a slice and put
butter on top of same. This makes a palatable dish if you have the
butter.</p>

<p>The price of flour&mdash;one of the ingredients of
bread&mdash;has gone down. The price of bread has not gone down.
There is, of course, a reason. We can't see it. But&mdash;</p>

<p>Bread-cart horses are eating more now than they did. Yeast has
shown a decided tendency to rise, and the Viennese tradesmen
engaged in making the swipes on top of Vienna loaves are demanding
more money.</p>

<p>Cottage loaves have shown a decided falling off, on account of
the operatives moving out of their cottages into flats.</p>

<p>On the whole, the situation is such that everyone should burst
into tears and tell their friends that the country is going to the
dogs.</p>

<p>Speaking of recipes, a good one for damper is:&mdash;Take 1lb.
flour, 1/2lb. baking powder, 3 eggs, 1 grated prawn, and sufficient
scones for nine people.</p>

<p>Eat scones. Stir remainder well.</p>

<p>Keep stirring. These are stirring times.</p>

<h2>TROUT SEASON NOW OPEN FOR SILVER FISHERMEN</h2>

<p>The trout season is now open. This reminds us of fish. There is
a lot of thrills to be got out of fishing, though not much fish. We
once struggled for nearly half an hour with a salmon, which only
weighed about a pound. The label was torn to pieces, and the tin
was dented in two places before we got him.</p>

<p>There are other ways of getting fish, even more strenuous.</p>

<p>Rock fishing, for instance. We don't recommend it unless you get
paid by the hour. A man might waste half a ton of rocks before he
hits one fish.</p>

<p>Then there's rod fishing. All right if you've got a good eye,
and are a fairly straight shot with the rod.</p>

<p>Line fishing? Well, we know a fair amount about line
fishing.</p>

<p>We have a line.</p>

<p>Some of us experts use a float instead of a sinker. We are not
in favour of this. With a decent sinker, you at least have a chance
of stunning the fish. Even if you don't catch the fish on the
forehead with the sinker, there is always the possibility that the
fish will swallow the thing, and die of lead poisoning.</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>Dynamiting is unsportsmanlike and uneconomical.</p>

<p>The procedure is to force the dynamite down the throat of the
fish, and light the fuse. Throw the fish away and run like
blazes.</p>

<p>The only fault in this method is that it does not do the fish
much good. It sort of permanently cures it of being a fish.</p>

<p>At deep-sea fishing we admit we are not much good. We give up.
Matter of fact, the giving up part is about all we know of deep-sea
fishing. Just throw the line over, if you've got the strength, and
throw everything else after it.</p>

<p>For a man getting up in years, fishing for limpets is good,
although inclined to be a bit monotonous.</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>But for those who cannot get close to the sea, said he
kindly-for those who are far from the roaring deep (said roaring
caused by the bass, the drummers, the wails, and the trumpeters,
besides all the other fish with internal organs), a little
silver-fishing is advised.</p>

<p>It is best done with two players. A small piece of carpet,
loaded with moth balls, is cast into the room or rooms. (Set lines
may be used.)</p>

<p>The silverfish emerges from its den, and claws gluttonishly at
the moth balls. After some hours, it reclines, sated, on the piece
of carpet, and may be drawn gently to a given spot. It is here that
the second player comes in. He engages the silverfish's attention
with "The Village Blacksmith" or "The Face on the Bar-room
Floor."</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>The silverfish props its head on one paw, and gazes in a dazed
manner at the elocutionist.</p>

<p>The head player then sneaks up behind it (the silverfish), grabs
it by the throat, and the rest is not suitable for young
readers.</p>

<p>We knew an expert who, without bait, caught 105 silverfish in
one night, simply by reciting "Gungha Din."</p>

<p>They came and gave themselves up in dozens.</p>

<p>There is very little more to be said about trout.</p>

<h2>LOVE AND POLITICS</h2>

<p>Like curry and custard, love and politics don't seem to go well
together. I've tried the mixture and served it up to the wife, but
it makes her sick. If the wife had any sense, which she hasn't,
she'd listen to me, and agree with me, and even, perhaps, encourage
me. But all she does is to say, "Here, shut up and hold this," and
I have to hold it and shut up.</p>

<p>We go shopping every Friday night. She wastes my hard-earned
money on groceries and throws the parcels on to me as if I was a
Thornycroft lorry. Then I buy a cigar, light it, and we walk about
the town so people can see me smoking it. Last Friday night I was
walking for three hours, nearly, before I saw anybody I knew. When
I did see them the cigar had gone out, and I couldn't puff the
thing at them. I had to content myself with waving it.</p>

<p>We look at shop windows: that is to say, she looks at them and I
stand around. Sometimes I manage to sneak past a hat shop, but most
times I get dragged back. She says, "That's a pretty cloche, dear!"
A cloche is a hat.</p>

<p>I say, "Huh!"</p>

<p>"I wish we could afford a fur coat," she says, wistfully. "Even
if it were only a coney."</p>

<p>"WE!" I say. "I like that! What the dickens could I do with a
fur coat?"</p>

<p>"You never think of anyone but yourself !"</p>

<p>"Anyhow, think of the poor little coneys, stripped of their warm
skins to make coats for us."</p>

<p>"Oh! I don't know how men can be so cruel!"</p>

<p>"They tear the little coneys from their mothers' bosoms and skin
them alive."</p>

<p>"Good gracious!"</p>

<p>"In those circumstances you wouldn't care to have a coat made
from their bleeding skins, would you?"</p>

<p>"Ar! You&mdash;!"</p>

<p>"Anyhow, if you had voted at the last elections instead of going
to bed so I'd have to answer the door when the time-payment man
called, you'd have had a fur coat by now."</p>

<p>"Would the Labor Party have issued us all with fur coats?"</p>

<p>"Arrgh!"</p>

<p>"You drag politics into everything. Last night, when you forgot
to wind the clock, you blamed the National Party. You threw
mother's parrot out because it looked like Bruce. As if a parrot
could look like a man like that! Mr. Bruce is a handsome,
he&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Have I nursed a viper in my bosom!"</p>

<p>"Don't you talk to me like that!"</p>

<p>"But listen, dear&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You needn't 'dear' me! I won't be vipered by anyone!"</p>

<p>"But I'm not vipering you, my dear, I'm just trying to point out
&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes! If you did a bit more work and a little less pointing out
I'd have a fur coat now instead of standing here like this,
shivering in these rags. You and your politics! Here am I, slaving,
working my fingers to the bone, trying to keep our bodies and souls
together&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I can keep my own body together, thanks. And listen to me! If
you think that politics have nothing to do with Friday night's
shopping, that's where you're wrong for the first time in your
life. Do you think you were given a vote so you could stay in bed
and neglect the use of it? Don't you ever think? You're my better
half, aren't you?"</p>

<p>"I reckon!"</p>

<p>"Well, what the&mdash;is the use of only half of me voting?
Can't you see how your neglect and apathy affect me?"</p>

<p>Deep silence. I can see by the furrows in her brow that she is
thinking. A good sign.</p>

<p>"If this country is mismanaged by a bad Government, who suffers?
Me&mdash; Us, I mean. Can't you see the connection between
groceries and governments, prices and politics?"</p>

<p>She scratches her nose and looks thoughtful. One thing about my
wife she will listen to sense.</p>

<p>We get near home, and I put in a parting shot.</p>

<p>"Now, supposing a Labor Government got into power and reduced
the tariff on fur coats&mdash;"</p>

<p>I pause for a moment to let it sink in.</p>

<p>"Len!"</p>

<p>"Yes, my love?"</p>

<p>I have evidently impressed her.</p>

<p>"Len, I never thought of it until now!"</p>

<p>"What, sweetness?"</p>

<p>"We've forgotten the beans!"</p>

<p>Beans!</p>

<p>When I got married, I made a great mistake.</p>

<h2>OVERCOMING CLASS CONSCIOUSNESS</h2>

<p>A considerable number of Socialistic reformers advocate the
cultivation of class-consciousness.</p>

<p>Having recently had two winning days at the ponies, and being
now a capitalist, I cannot agree with them.</p>

<p>Noah was the first man to make the lion and the lamb sleep in
the same bunk, and he, being the forerunner of Inchcape and the
only man to have a menagerie and a monopoly at the same time, is
entitled to some respect.</p>

<p>To emphasise the difference between a capitalist and a worker is
to emphasise the difference between the former's income and the
latter's.</p>

<p>Which is manifestly unfair.</p>

<p>Speaking as a capitalist, I would like it noted that while
recognising the enormous gulf which stretches between the ordinary
worker and the man of wealth who has had two successful days at the
ponies, I still think that the gap should be bridged.</p>

<p>It would not take much bridging, and with the worker viewing
life in the same way as the capitalist, it would not be long before
he realised his responsibilities as a worker and ceased to be
discontented.</p>

<p>Various highly-placed personages have expressed the opinion that
at least one span might be extended across the gulf if the working
classes would only learn to speak with the same faultless diction
as their masters.</p>

<p>A very good idea, and one that could be easily put into
operation.</p>

<p>For the purposes of demonstrating the ease of it, we will
examine its operation on a member, say, of the building trade.</p>

<p>The member of the building trade is seeking a job. He approaches
the foreman.</p>

<p>Removing his hat, he says: "Pardon me, old chap; but I am
seeking employment. If I can be of any assistance to you in the
furtherance of your designs, I would be delighted to devote my time
to your service at the usual rate."</p>

<p>Sounds jolly, doesn't it?</p>

<p>Much better than, "Anything doin', Joe?"</p>

<p>You see the idea?</p>

<p>Then there is the matter of dress. It would entail no hardship
for a hod-carrier to come to work decently attired.</p>

<p>The spats and morning coat could be removed when commencing
work, and the silk hat stowed away in the tucker box. It would, of
course, be necessary to wear gloves while working, but, then, all
tools being fitted with ivory handles, the wear and tear would not
be so very great.</p>

<p>And the social side must not be neglected. It would be a simple
and courteous gesture of hospitality if the mortar-mixers were "At
Home" on Saturday afternoons to the brick-layers. The hod-carriers
could give a little soiree for the plasterers, and the foreman
could be made the guest of honor at the tea-boys' coming out party,
and so on.</p>

<p>Everything would be nice and sociable, and the contractor and
owner of the building would have no hesitation in inviting a select
number of refined workers to meet the architect and ride out on the
Ford lorry.</p>

<p>Courtesy need not stop at these little social events. It can and
should be practised all the time.</p>

<p>Little thoughtful actions, like bringing flowers to the foreman,
and perhaps an occasional cigar for the employer, all help to
sweeten life and keep the social amenities well oiled.</p>

<p>Going further, concerts could be held in the lunch interval.</p>

<p>In the presence of good, refined music, classconsciousness is
sunk, and the worker is elevated by the Muse to the level of his
superiors.</p>

<p>And that is just what we want. Unity of outlook, the worker
seeing eye to eye with the capitalist, and restraining from
unreasonable requests for higher wages.</p>

<p>Well, then, the concert!</p>

<p>Operatic music is good, but being sung mostly in a foreign
language, it lacks the quality of sympathy that binds the classes
together.</p>

<p>Songs such as "We're Here Because We're Here" and "Paddy
McGinty's Goat" are, of course, impossible. What we want, then, is
suitable English words set to operatic music.</p>

<p>I'll try and show you what I mean.</p>

<p>We will suppose it is lunch time. Gentlemen engaged on the job
are sitting, chatting idly, discussing personalities and the latest
Vice-Regal reception.</p>

<p>The foreman waves his baton, and the concert commences.</p>

<p>Something like this:</p>

<p>Bricklayers: "Oh! The bally old bricks we jolly well lay."</p>

<p>Hod-carriers: "Too true, they jolly well lay them!"</p>

<p>Bricklayers: "We lay them neatly&mdash;just this way"
(demonstrating).</p>

<p>Employers, Foremen, etc.: "And we have to jolly well pay
them!"</p>

<p>Chorus:</p>

<p>Mortar-mixers: "Oh! We mix, mix, mix!"</p>

<p>Bricklayers: "And we lay, lay, lay!"</p>

<p>Hod-carriers: "And we hod, hod, hod!"</p>

<p>Employers, etc.: "And we pay, pay, pay!"</p>

<p>And so it goes on.</p>

<p>Now just think what an enormous difference this would make!</p>

<p>The refinement! The good feeling and fellowship! It would be a
common occurrence for two hod-carriers to pause at the foot of a
ladder and bow, murmuring at the same time, "After you, sir!"</p>

<p>Isn't this much better than swearing at the foreman, and trying
to drop a brick on the boss?</p>

<p>Of course it is.</p>

<p>Well, go to it. Attaboy!</p>

<p>I, myself, having had two good days at the ponies&mdash;I think
I have mentioned this before&mdash;but what I mean to say is that
I'd like to see you workers drag yourselves up to my level and drop
all this class-conscious stuff.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if you wait till after the next pony meeting,
I may be with you. In which case the gap will be bridged by a
punt!</p>

<h2>BANKING: HOW SHE WORKS</h2>

<p>Being an Heroic Attempt at an Explanation</p>

<p>A rudimentary knowledge of banking and banks does not
necessarily imply the possession of a bank balance. One might as
well demand that anti-vivisectionists be partly vivisected so that
they may back their antipathy with personal and acute
experience.</p>

<p>My actual experience in the matter of banking is such that if
all the notes I had banked were placed end to end they would
reach...</p>

<p>What's the lineal measure for atom?</p>

<p>While in my callow youth, and spurred on by the fierce pangs of
love, I banked ten shillings. Two days later I reluctantly withdrew
it, and my account was closed forever. If Sunday had not intervened
I might have had it out earlier.</p>

<p>This rambling explanation is intended, not so much as an
apology, as a proof that one needn't have money in the bank to have
an interest in banks. All right then.</p>

<p>Small metal tokens of some intrinsic value and colored strips of
paper&mdash;which, in the middle of the Sahara desert, could only
be prized in so far as their artistic merit appealed&mdash;are
money.</p>

<p>Money is a means of facilitating exchange.</p>

<p>That is to say, the possession of a poundnote saves you the
trouble of carrying five hundredweight of home-grown potatoes down
to Anthony Horderns' when you wish to buy a pair of boots.</p>

<p>Likewise, the institution of the monetary system prevents the
boss from paying you in alarm clocks.</p>

<p>The first man to become wealthy accumulated his hoard very
slowly. Finding himself with a surplus of pumpkins, he swopped a
few of them with neighbors in adjoining caves, for stone clubs
bear&mdash;skins, and whatnot.</p>

<p>Nature pursued its relentless course and foisted more pumpkins
on to him. By degrees he accumulated an enormous stock of bear
skins, etcetera, as well as pumpkins.</p>

<p>Came a drought or an earthquake. We forget now which it was. The
bears died off in hundreds. For want of a feed of pumpkin the
stoneclub maker was too weak to make stone clubs.</p>

<p>(This is where we deviate a little from historical accuracy, for
the sake of the analogy.)</p>

<p>The drought or the earthquake eased off, and Nature took up her
burden of making bears.</p>

<p>But things were very bad.</p>

<p>One day a man came to the cave of the pumpkin millionaire.</p>

<p>"Look here," he said, in his simple, straightforward way. "I've
got an idea for growing woad plants. There'll be a big demand for
woad presently, and it's a great proposition."</p>

<p>"Well?" queried the wealthy one languidly. "What about it?"</p>

<p>"I'm broke," answered the other. "Will you finance me?"</p>

<p>"What security have you?"</p>

<p>"Well, I've an extensive cave, fur-lined throughout, in a good
defensive position, free from pterodactyls; also four wives, two
being practically new and the other two so thoroughly domesticated
that they grovel every time I raise my club. I should say the lot
was worth about 100 stone clubs or 300 pumpkins at the present rate
of exchange."</p>

<p>"H'm! How much do you want?"</p>

<p>"Eighty clubs should be sufficient to put my woad plantation on
a working basis."</p>

<p>They went into details. At last the pumpkinaire, after
convincing himself that there was a good demand for woad, that the
intending borrower was a hard worker, and that he knew all about
woad, decided to finance him. He accordingly financed him with
fifty clubs, taking the hundred club's worth of cave and wives as a
security.</p>

<p>At the end of the year the borrower was to return sixty clubs
for the fifty lent.</p>

<p>The woad plantation got under way, and that was that.</p>

<p>Men in adjoining caves heard of the enterprising woad planter's
success, and came in droves to the cave of the pumpkinaire. If he
fancied their projects and liked their security, he financed
them.</p>

<p>Now, this is where the funny part comes in.</p>

<p>Everybody knew that the pumpkinaire was wealthy, and one day a
man came to borrow thirty bear skins, as he was converting his cave
into flats. And the pumpkinaire didn't have a skin in the
place.</p>

<p>This is what he did.</p>

<p>He said: "Take this smooth, stone with the funny mark on it to
the fellow over the river. Tell him to give you thirty bear skins,
and when he returns that stone to me I'll pay him."</p>

<p>The fellow did as he was told.</p>

<p>Said the man over the river: "It's a bit unusual, but I know the
pumpkinaire. He is a man of wealth. He always pays up. This stone
is worth thirty bear skins any old day in the week!"</p>

<p>It worked, you see, and the pumpkinaire thought deeply on the
matter. He began to see that it was only a matter of a big
reputation, a few stones, and faith on the part of the
stoneholders.</p>

<p>The stone came back; the pumpkinaire paid up, and lent the stone
out again. It circulated. People began to know that it was worth
thirty bear skins.</p>

<p>The pumpkinaire got more stones, and marked them with his
private mark. The day came when he had 3000 pumpkins' worth of
stones in circulation and only 500 pumpkins. It made no difference.
People believed in him.</p>

<p>Behold, the first bank.</p>

<p>Now, let us consider. If in his eagerness to grab the banker
made 1000 stones when the total value of all the goods in the
community was only 500 stones, he inflated the currency. The stone
that was supposed to be worth 30 bear skins would only be worth 15
bear skins.</p>

<p>The money wealth of the community would be 1000 stones.</p>

<p>The real wealth would be 500 stones' worth of goods and 500
stones' worth of faith (or belief in the banker's ability to
pay).</p>

<p>Possessed of only 500 stones' worth of real wealth, the
community has to pay back to the banker 1000 stones, plus interest.
(Be patient. It's dreadfully difficult to keep from getting tangled
up.)</p>

<p>Now you can see that with its measly 500 stones the community
will have to work like mad, twice as hard as they ought, to pay
back the banker's thousand.</p>

<p>You can see that people are going to economise in all
directions. You can see how the slaves will be put on short
rations. You can see the unemployment coming.</p>

<p>You can see why, when we borrow abroad, pledging the horny hands
of Australia as security, we must pay back in gold or
privileges.</p>

<p>We must pay back in something tangible&mdash;not
faith-notes.</p>

<p>You can see that 5,000,000 American dollars is&mdash;or is
supposed to be&mdash;5,000,000 dollars' worth of American goods. We
may do what we like with the money, buy English goods if we like,
but sooner or later, by the simple process of exchange, that money
must go back to America. And in America that five million
represents five millions' worth of goods.</p>

<p>We don't borrow money; we borrow goods.</p>

<p>Wiping the sweat off our eye-shade we pause for breath, and
admit that we have bitten off more than we can chew.</p>

<p>Banking is a big subject, and stretchs as far beyond the scope
of this article as a verbatim report of the proceedings at the
Tower of Babel.</p>

<p>Like trying to put your pet whale in a glass bowl to fraternise
with the gold-fish.</p>

<p>But stop cheering. We haven't finished yet. Sorry.</p>

<p>We would just like to point out the possibilities, the
ramifications and the power of banks and bankers.</p>

<p>We would like to point out that the business of banking is
something that affects you&mdash;even if you haven't got a "crab"
to your name.</p>

<p>You can see that the big bankers can promote industry, or put
the brakes on it simply by giving or withholding loans.</p>

<p>You can see that they are the Master Minds behind the
capitalist.</p>

<p>You can see that they hold us in the hollow of their hands.</p>

<p>Do you see the necessity for Government control of banking?</p>

<h2>CURRENCY BASED ON EXPERIENCE</h2>

<p>We have a PLAN. Before we go any further, it would be best,
perhaps, to give a rough explanation of our monetary situation,
particularly where it touches our fiscal fiduciaries.</p>

<p>No. Maybe we hadn't better...</p>

<p>Our Plan is really the introduction of a practical currency
based on the experience of a life-time.</p>

<p>We propose to have printed notes of various denominations and
sizes.</p>

<p>The nineteen and elevenpence three farthings note will be about
12 inches square and suitable for use at millinery sales.</p>

<p>The 37/6, or Boarding House, note will be a little larger, so
that the boarder, having paid the landlady with it, the landlady
may then wrap the boarder's lunch in it.</p>

<p>From there we go to the 5 pound, 10 pound, and 20 pound issues,
which will be of correspondingly larger size, enabling one to wrap
up larger parcels.</p>

<p>We have another bright idea for keyholeshaped coins. These would
be especially useful after hours. The trouble would be to get
keyhole-shaped bottles. We'd probably bring in an Enlarged Keyholes
(Amendment) Act.</p>

<p>All this is detail.</p>

<p>Broadly, the Lower Plan consists in printing some tens of
millions of five pound notes and distributing two to each of the
population. Of course, they would be worth only about 5/&mdash;each
but that would be 10/-, anyhow; and who is in need of ten
shillings?</p>

<p>STAND BACK! The Plan hasn't started yet.</p>

<p>But is it any good! Mais, oui!</p>

<h2>ANZAC NIGHT IN THE GARDENS</h2>

<p>Lost in the wilds of the Botanic Gardens! Heavens, shall we ever
forget it! The last human face we saw was that of Matthew Flinders,
the great explorer.</p>

<p>We got in with a few Anzacs last night, and we forget how we got
into the Gardens, but, believe us, it's terrible. Instructive, but
terrible.</p>

<p>Nothing to drink but goldfish.</p>

<p>Bottle-trees dotted about the place, and we had no opener. Naked
men and women standing on square white-washed rocks. All dumb!</p>

<p>We wandered up to a signboard, thinking to read, "Ten miles
to..." and saw there, "Please do not walk on the grass
borders."</p>

<p>Starving, practically, we climbed a coconut tree for food and
found it was a date tree without any dates on it.</p>

<p>We came to a tree marked "Dysoxolum." We thought&mdash;we
KNEW&mdash;how sox were dyed&mdash;but what shall it profit a man
if he lose himself in the Gardens?</p>

<p>We came to where the tortoise slept, and knocked on his shell.
Like all the rest of our friends, he was in, but he didn't
answer.</p>

<p>Dawn found us clawing at the front of the Herbarium, shrieking
hysterically for just a little thyme.</p>

<p>The keeper who found us said that everything was all right and
this was the way out. We don't know what became of the others.</p>

<p>Probably their bodies will be found in the bandstand and
identified by their pawn tickets.</p>

<p>The Anzacs certainly were, and still are, a tough crowd.</p>

<p>We will never go into the Gardens again without wearing all our
medals and two identification discs.</p>

<p>It's always best to carry a spare on Anzac night.</p>

<h2>LOWER TURNS HIGHBROW</h2>

<p>Music Week commences to-day.</p>

<p>Why is music weak? Because it's always in bars. (Roars of
applause.)</p>

<p>HUNDREDS of conductors baton on the music industry. Thousands of
unemployed musicians roam the city and suburbs, blowing trumpets.
Tens of thousands of collectors roam with them, shaking collection
boxes.</p>

<p>The only way these men can get beef is to cornet. (Angry murmurs
from gallery.)</p>

<p>The Minister for Education has said that "A country without
music is uncivilised."</p>

<p>You are invited to bare your savage breast and have it soothed
with a mouth-organ solo. We don't want to harp on this
but&mdash;let it bassoon. (Sorry.)</p>

<p>There will be a concertina Town Hall one night this week,
accordion to programme. (Shrieks of "Want our money Bach!")</p>

<p>The greatest epicures of our times, who have put up all the best
epics so far, have been fond of music.</p>

<p>Amy Johnson flute England. Consider Bradman's baton. (Oh, viol!)
Kingsford Smith's plane.</p>

<p>These are cymbals of achievement.</p>

<p>The Crematorium of Music, in doing its best to foster a love of
music, will enable us all to sing "God Save the King" with
passionate fervor at the conclusion of recitals, and gasps of
relief on exitting from classical concerts will be emitted in a
much more musical manner than here.</p>

<p>We, before leaving you, would suggest that perhaps some little
improvement might be effected in our songs.</p>

<p>For instance: "Come to dinner. Come to dinner. Hear the bell!
Bacon and potatoes, etc."</p>

<p>Much better would be, "Come to Dinner," and so on, "Porterhouse
steak and mushrooms, with a quart of McEwans, black coffee, with
lemon, etc."</p>

<p>Let us finish this thing appropriately:</p>

<p>DOH RAY ME FAH SO LAY TEE DOH KAY UM TOO PHUT AM WHOA!</p>

<p>Good.</p>

<h2>ALL CRACKED AT THE TOWN HALL<br>
SOME UNPUBLISHED HISTORY</h2>

<p>The masonry of the Town Hall is not on the square. The place is
now in such a dangerous condition owing to blasting operations that
aldermen are gravely concerned. The portico is cracked. The tower
is cracked. The aldermen are...going to discuss the matter
to-day.</p>

<p>The City Engineer says that "the condition is due to fretting of
the stonework." And city ratepayers will feel a certain amount of
sympathy with the stonework.</p>

<p>Personally, we have never seen a stonework, although we know a
brickworks, but, anyhow, the history of the Town Hall is very
interesting.</p>

<p>Mr. Martin Carrick, who has been Lord Mayor's orderly for the
past 150 years, was discovered by Governor Bligh, standing on the
spot where now stands the Town Hall.</p>

<p>So greatly did the Governor admire Mr. Carrick's uniform that he
caused the Town Hall to be built around him.</p>

<p>The lift is worth a visit. Originally built for a green Mexican
parrot, it was left on the hands of the civic authorities when the
bird suddenly developed cirrhosis of the beak, and passed away
unanimously.</p>

<p>The perch was removed, and the old cage converted into a lift,
into which it is possible to crowd two passengers and the driver,
or the driver and one alderman.</p>

<p>All this, as we said before, is very interesting, and it would,
indeed, be a pity to see this historic structure crash to the
ground while the council was in session, without first removing Mr.
Carrick and the lift, and locking all exits.</p>

<p>Please do not walk an the grass borders.</p>

<h2>THE BUTCHERS' PICNIC</h2>

<p>Butchers shut up their chops yesterday and went to a picnic.
It's about time they had a spell.</p>

<p>IT'S time the abattoirs had a spell, too, only they're so hard
to spell.</p>

<p>It was yesterday we were sent for a pound of steak, and given
1/8, and we had to get six-pennorth of ham instead&mdash;the change
was ours.</p>

<p>The butchers had their picnic just for the change. That's the
only reason we ever volunteer to go to the butchers'. Just for the
change.</p>

<p>You get interested in butchers when they butcher to a lot of
trouble.</p>

<p>How many of us know one slab of steak from another? There are
the bladebone steaks, porterhouse steaks, Adrian Knox Stakes,
Cantala Stakes, and kid-stakes, which you only dish up as a last
resource.</p>

<p>Take chops. A chop is merely a steak with a bone in it. If a
sausage had a backbone and a bulging forehead, it would be a
chop.</p>

<p>Dare say there are any number of sausages taking correspondence
courses, hoping to become chops.</p>

<p>A butcher, kidneys wife, may be a high liver, but he lives
according to his lights; it's a heart life.</p>

<p>Sheep's Head cannot be found on the atlas, and altogether, the
butcher is worthy of his steal.</p>

<p>Any man who takes a holiday now is mad; but a butcher, his job
is skewer.</p>

<p>Saying which, he fell on his gherkins and abandoned the
butchering business.</p>

<p>Which was only meet.</p>

<p>Recomember! The butcher was the man who put the "laughter" into
"slaughter."</p>

<p>Let him get thick on his hollow-day.</p>

<h2>UNTRUE FACTS ABOUT SNAKES</h2>

<p>Healthy black snakes of 4 feet 6 inches or over will be paid for
by the Taronga Park Trustees. This, according to the "Sun," is "a
chance for our unemployed."</p>

<p>It seems to us also that there will be fewer unemployed after
they have finished with the snakes.</p>

<p>Or, we may yet hear whisperings in the lounge of the Hotel
Australia, "Yes, they say he made his money entirely out of
snakes."</p>

<p>We consulted Chambers' encyclopaedia and learned that a snake
has no legs, but travels by means of its scales. Which is tough on
the Tramway Department.</p>

<p>The adder is sum snake. It has no eyelids, but sees out of its
snaked eye.</p>

<p>It may interest the unemployed to learn that the female snake is
larger than the male, and the male cannot be stretched except in
cases where it gets away. Then you can say anything.</p>

<p>The viper is a Jewish snake closely allied to the pen-viper, and
the dish-viper. It sheds its skin twice a year, but no one can find
the shed.</p>

<p>The black snake is black, and may easily be told, although it is
partially deaf. In catching the black snake, grasp it firmly behind
the back of the ears, and ahead of the squirm. Should it bite, on
no account bite it back, as snakes are poisonous.</p>

<p>It is far better, if bitten, to rub the snake with permanganate
of potash, at the same time tying a ligature between the snake and
the bitten portion. This method only fails on occasions.</p>

<p>Now a parting word. Measure the snake carefully before catching
it. If it is less than 4 feet 6 inches long, don't waste your
time.</p>

<p>Small snakes may be charmed with a tin whistle. Black snakes
need a jazz band.</p>

<p>Remember your geometry. A straight line is the shortest distance
between a snake and some other place.</p>

<h2>BRADMAN AND THE BURGLAR</h2>

<p>It was 2.30 a.m.</p>

<p>The burglar paused outside the window, jemmy in hand. A light
filtered through the drawn blind, but it was the dull mumbling from
within that held him hesitant for some minutes.</p>

<p>THEN he very gently, very expertly, opened the window. A harsh,
stilted voice said, "Bradman's score now stands at 301."</p>

<p>Five people were hunched about the loud speaker. Father, mother,
two sons, and a daughter. The floor was littered with half-burnt
cigarette ends and dead matches. One of the younger men was dotting
down Bradman's hits on the back of a player roll which was already
half unrolled.</p>

<p>"McCabe cover-drove another for two," carked the loud
speaker.</p>

<p>"Who's bowling?" said the burglar excitedly, stepping into the
room.</p>

<p>"Larwood," said the whole family, without looking up.</p>

<p>"Goodo!" exclaimed the burglar.</p>

<p>Searching the house, he packed up the most portable valuables
and was looking for more when a loud, harmonious groan came from
around the loud speaker.</p>

<p>"Wot's up!" he cried, rushing in. "Is 'e out?"</p>

<p>"Clean bowled by that beast Larwood," sobbed the mother, dabbing
her eyes with her handkerchief.</p>

<p>"That's the front door," said the father. "Someone answer
it."</p>

<p>No one answered it. "Tate bowling," said the announcer.</p>

<p>"I suppose I'll 'ave to go," grumbled the burglar. A scream came
from the room as he opened the door.</p>

<p>"What's wrong here?" said the policeman sternly.</p>

<p>"Richardson's out for one!" murmured the burglar in a hoarse
voice.</p>

<p>"My God!" exclaimed the policeman, rushing in.</p>

<p>And at 3.45 a.m., the blear-eyed family dragged itself to bed,
the policeman, nervously gazing about for the sergeant, went back
to his beat, and the burglar went home, having forgotten his
loot.</p>

<p>"Any'ow," he muttered, as he climbed wearily into his bed. "I
don't care. Five 'undred and sixty-six is goin' to take some
catchin'."</p>

<h2>OUR OUTING IN THE HOBO LINE<br>
SHEDDING TEARS IN TOOLSHED.</h2>

<p>With a certain amount of disrespect we have been asked to write
something about hoboes, an account of a hoboes' college being
discovered in America.</p>

<p>We have been unable to find out whether this means that we have
to become autobiographical (autobigraphical, autobigraphical,
autobiographical, it wasn't a fluke) about it.</p>

<p>Delving into the remains of our vast experience, we are able to
inform you that hoboes are people who fling themselves on to
freight trains in a desperate attempt to escape work, and, having
arrived at a town, knock on its door and boast that they have not
had a feed for nine consecutive years.</p>

<p>"Kind lady," you say, "could you lend me a piece of hard, dry,
mouldy, hopeless bread to eat with this roast turkey?"</p>

<p>The lady bursts into tears, and you offer to chop some wood,
having some pride left, and sneak off and pawn the axe.</p>

<p>Occasionally a hobo falls on evil times. Last year we were out
of work we had the bad luck to have the husband answer the
door.</p>

<p>Automatically we said: "We have a wife and five children. Our
wife got out of work and was unable to support us. Accordingly, we
left home, and am now starving. If we had a trombone, we'd play it
at you. All we ask of you is a crust."</p>

<p>His eyes glittered. "Go down to the tool-shed and I'll sneak
something out to you. I'm just back from my honeymoon."</p>

<p>We waited expectantly. Presently he came. He had taken us
literally. In his hand was the crustiest crust we've ever
viewed.</p>

<p>He closed the door, and his hand dips into his pocket. "Eat
this," he said, as he thrust a black piece of charcoal at us. We
took it, turned it over, smelt it, and our sombre eyes questioned
him.</p>

<p>"Fillet steak," he growled. "Annabelle's first attempt."</p>

<p>When I looked up again he was wolfing the crust.</p>

<p>Kind lady, I want a job.</p>

<h2>DRINKS WITH A KICK IN THEM</h2>

<p>The President of the Housewives' Association says that she does
not believe in cocktail drinking, and could, if necessary, produce
a drink with a "kick" in it, from fruit.</p>

<p>ANTICIPATING, we have evolved a few recipes to suit all
tastes.</p>

<p>BANANA FLUTTER.&mdash;Take one banana, slice, and put into
glass. Take half a coconut and beat it into a stiff froth. Mix
briskly and serve. The "kick" is obtained by standing on one foot
on the skin of the banana and leaning forward while pouring the
drink down the back of the neck.</p>

<p>Then we have the FLYING MULE.</p>

<p>Take half-dozen raspberries, being careful to remove the seeds,
also the sound. Mash lightly with hammer. Mix with little
ice-water, and add seeds slowly, one at a time, until you are so
thirsty that you'd drink anything. Now take a red-hot nail, and dip
it smartly into the mixture, removing it almost immediately. Drink
nail.</p>

<p>THE WATERMELON WHOOPEE.&mdash;Take one large watermelon, cut in
half. Hollow out one half and place contents in wash-basin. Save
seeds from other half. Place in wash-basin one small cup of
gramophone needles, half-pint of sulphuric acid. Drink before
bottom falls out of wash&mdash;basin.</p>

<p>A similar mixture is the HANGOVER BLUES. The watermelon is put
into the washbasin as before, but covered with crushed ice. The
hollowed-out portion is then quarter-filled with crushed ice and
placed over the head, taking care to pull it well down over the
forehead. The face is then laid gently in the wash-basin.</p>

<p>It will be seen from the above recipes that the uses of fruit as
a drink are practically unlimited. Furthermore, most fruit is full
of vitamines.</p>

<p>These need not worry the hostess, however, as they can easily be
detected by the small holes in the outside of the skin, and this
part can be cut out.</p>

<p>And don't forget&mdash;all these drinks have a kick.</p>

<p>The careful hostess should warn her guests of this danger.</p>

<h2>MUST DRINK BEER</h2>

<p>The perfect job has been found. Keep your seats, all the
positions have been filled, and 143,000 citizens were killed in the
rush.</p>

<p>The Dortmund Physiological Institute has on its wages list fifty
workers, who, in the cause of science, are engaged in drinking
beer. That is all they have to do. The scientists of the
institution then test, the subjects for fatigue, etcetera.</p>

<p>This must be very jolly for the scientists. We should imagine
that the first test would be to take a piece of the patient's,
breath and cut it into slices small enough to go into a test
tube.</p>

<p>We have a friend who frequently goes home to be examined by a
select committee of one.</p>

<p>The first question put to the patient is, "OH, so you're
home?"</p>

<p>To this the patient does not reply, thus showing a remarkable
degree of intelligence. We have gathered together a fair amount of
data on the subject, and perhaps it would be best to catalogue the
reactions.</p>

<p>(1) Goes into bathroom and looks at self in mirror.</p>

<p>(2) Locks bathroom door and searches pockets.</p>

<p>(3) Looks at cold shower, shudders, washes face.</p>

<p>(4) Makes bed on couch. Sleeps. The morning symptoms are perhaps
best left out, being a bit too technical.</p>

<p>We shall merely remark that a new excuse is now on. You can go
home and say that you are a martyr to science.</p>

<p>Interested as we are in scientific investigation, we suggest
that this country should co-operate with the Dortmund Institute,
thus advancing science and giving employment, if possible, to
millions.</p>

<p>Then we might have the spectacle of a gentleman wrenching
himself from the grasp of the police, and saying, "Exshuse me,
conshtable! I am attached to the shtaff of the Redfern
Institute...HIC!"</p>

<p>The constable would then apologise and sneak off, blushing.</p>

<p>Speed the day.</p>

<h2>HOW TOPPING, BY JOVE, WHAT!</h2>

<p>Nobleman, 48 (bonafide), seeks, v.m., Lady, intell., charm,
capable holding position in society. HOLTS.</p>

<p>THIS is a chuck in for some lady. Last time we were a nobleman
we felt the need of some companion, not only intell. and charm, and
capable of holding a position.</p>

<p>Hemmed in by butlers, surrounded by footmen, we had only to
press a bell, and in the servants' quarter they would say, "He's
pressing the bell. Let us all hide."</p>

<p>We would then lie in our sumptuous bed, on our palatial pillow,
and gnaw our moustaches. Leaping out of our four-poster after a
suitable interval, we would then yell for the groom. "GROOM! Catch
me a horse! I have obesity, therefore the horse must have
exercise."</p>

<p>The groom would touch his forelock in a pathetic manner, and get
us a horse.</p>

<p>We would then get into our riding boots, go out, and have a look
at the horse, and say to one of the faithful retainers, "Ride
it."</p>

<p>We would then go back to bed.</p>

<p>We would ring the bell once more, saying to the valet, "Bring me
a glass of rum with an emerald in it, and a dish of prawns."</p>

<p>This butterfly existence soon undermined our constitution. So we
married the lady from the adjoining manor.</p>

<p>Since then we have fallen from our high estate. She couldn't
hold her position, being sacked three times from various
laundries.</p>

<p>That is my story, gentlemen. I wasn't always like this. Time was
when I rode in me carriage.</p>

<p>But, stay! You were in the 55th Battalion! Spare me ninepence
for a bed. Or a shilling, so that I may have soda. God bless
you!</p>

<h2>MILK BOARD</h2>

<p>Well, if you MUST know, we went to a meeting of the Milk Board.
And if you say another ward, we'll go out again.</p>

<p>WE went into the place and woke up one of the reporters at the
Press table. "It's about milk," he said, pathetically.</p>

<p>We had a look around&mdash;it was the least we could do. We saw
rows of people sitting in rows of chairs. There was a row of
milk-boarders sitting at a long table.</p>

<p>There was a lot of confused mumbling going on. So we went
away.</p>

<p>And in the nearest barber's saloon we thought over this Milk
Board and reconstituted it.</p>

<p>There should be on the Milk Board, a distributor, a consumer,
and cow.</p>

<p>But let us take a look at this milk. It is a thick white
substance with rum in it. Or it may be very shaken with vanilla in
it; it depends on the cow who serves you.</p>

<p>There is no udder source of milk than the cow, which is an
animal with two horns which it never toots.</p>

<p>Cream is separated from milk. That's why lots of householders
should sue for restitution of conjugal rites, with the accent on
the jug.</p>

<p>Butter is agitated cream. We can blame Russia for this.</p>

<p>The cow is the king of beasts, and may its chedder never grow
less; but milk being jugged, canned, and drunk, we fail to see how
it can be respectably recommended.</p>

<p>Getting back to the Milk Board meeting, we heard a dairyman say,
"We cannot sell our milk at this price." And his colleagues looked
very sympathetic.</p>

<p>Having in mind the poultry farmer who has to lay his eggs on a
small margin, he had no sympathy from us.</p>

<p>But this Milk Board&mdash;we spell it milk bored. Who the heck
(I have been told that I must not say h&mdash;l) cares about
milk?</p>

<h2>NEW OPERA</h2>

<p>Spurred on by the successful debut of the first Jewish opera in
Sydney, the Scottish community is working hard to arrange a Scotch
opera.</p>

<p>There will be an orchestra of 50 bagpipes and 18 drums. Twelve
big drums and six bigger drums.</p>

<p>Admission tickets may be purchased on the lay-by or at the
door.</p>

<p>The McGagget clan has expressed its willingness to collect at
the box office, and suitable first aid facilities have been
arranged for the benefit of those people who try to get in free.
Promissory notes will not be accepted.</p>

<p>The story of the opera is woven round a feud between two old
clans as to the possession of a bent thruppence which was found on
the border of the two estates.</p>

<p>The love motif would bring tears to the eyes of a deaf Chinese
pugilist. The chieftan's daughter, who is sent to poison the rival
chieftan's son's haggis, falls in love with the man she is sent to
destroy, because he has gold fillings in his teeth.</p>

<p>Sung by Maggle Macraggers, "Oh, Smile at Me Again" is touching
enough to make an eiderdown mattress quack.</p>

<p>When the, 50 bagpipes and the 18 drums join in the last tender
passages, it would be scarcely possible to hear a pin drop, even if
any one of the audience was careless enough to drop it.</p>

<p>The climax is reached when the victorious chieftan has to hold
the disputed thruppence in his hand and sing, "Bent But Not
Broke."</p>

<p>In Glasgow, the stage was mobbed while this scene was taking
place. It is not known who got the thruppence.</p>

<p>A braw nicht will be had by all who have the money to appreciate
an outstanding performance given&mdash;no, not given&mdash;staged
by that section of the community to whom we owe so much, that is to
say&mdash;to whom we could not owe less.</p>

<h2>EVERY CLOUD HAS A WET LINING</h2>

<p>The drought is at last broken. We felt this drought keenly. At
Woollahra, our carnations were in a fearful state. Our snapdragons
were scarcely able to snap.</p>

<p>In the country they were running barely 25 prickly-pear plants
to the acre. We used to go out on our farm and look at our wheat,
or it might have been sheep&mdash;it would depend where we were
looking&mdash;and moan.</p>

<p>We tried to bring on the rain by going out without an umbrella
or overcoat. But it was the country, not the city. We would hold
out our hand and look up at the sky, and a bird would pass. That
would be all.</p>

<p>Athwart, the blasted, blistered plain, the sheep died in long
orderly rows. The little wheat plants popped up, looked around, and
popped back. Ruin stared us in the face.</p>

<p>A commercial traveller brought us a bottle of water. The
children raved about it. It tasted funny with a dash of whisky.</p>

<p>Then one day&mdash;Sunday, we think&mdash;the clouds gathered.
The lightning flashed. The thunder rolled. And the rain came
down.</p>

<p>It was great.</p>

<p>Four of our best cows were struck by lightning, and have been
giving curdled milk ever since. Grandfather was drowned in the
creek.</p>

<p>All our sheep learned to swim. We had to put dishes under the
holes in the roof; the barn blew over, and the reaper and binder
got washed on to the pub verandah, five miles away.</p>

<p>In the morning we went out in boats and had a look at the
wheat.</p>

<p>Given another drought to dry things up, we'll be on the pig's
back.</p>

<p>It's a great country if you don't get depressed.</p>

<h2>DON'S BOYHOOD FRIENDS</h2>

<p>It's marvellous the number of people who knew Don Bradman when
he was a small boy in short trousers. We met approximately 158 of
them yesterday.</p>

<p>THEY told us: "I used to say to young Don, 'Don, you keep on the
way you're going and some day you'll play for Australia.' I could
SEE that the boy was a born batsman..." etc.</p>

<p>Plain bunk, that's all it is. Now when we knew young Don, WE
used to say to him, "Don, my boy, you keep on the way you're
going..."</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, we told the trainguard about it, sitting in
the front seat on the way to Watson's Bay.</p>

<p>The driver nearly ran over four pedestrians, and the conductor
forgot to collect our fare, thus allowing us a profit of 5d.</p>

<p>We were in the Court the other day when the murderer was asked
if he had anything to say before being sentenced to death.</p>

<p>"Yes, Judge," he replied. "I think that Woodfull and Bradman are
two of the greatest cricketers in history."</p>

<p>Whereupon the whole Court cheered madly, and he was let off with
a fine, the solicitors waiving costs.</p>

<p>We even heard a rumour that members of the Union Club were
kicking each other's hats around the billiard room.</p>

<p>There was a man sacked yesterday from a large Sussex Street
warehouse, and, pausing at the door, he said: "Anyhow, I think
we'll win this Test."</p>

<p>So the boss said: "Bring that man back. He's got brains. We
can't afford to lose men like that."</p>

<p>But it doesn't always work.</p>

<p>We got home pretty late last night, and thinking to get in
first, said: "What do you think! Bradman's 215 umpty not out!"</p>

<p>"Who is this Bradman?" she said, and while we were recovering,
"Anyhow, I don't wish to hear about your drunken friends. Two
hundred and umpty not out! Why, YOU! You're only 30, and you're
always out!"</p>

<p>What's a man to do with a woman like that?</p>

<p>Women have no sense of values.</p>

<h2>ON INFLATION<br>
JUST WHAT IS WRONG AT THE MOMENT</h2>

<p>In case we should be misunderstood, we should like to point out
the horrible results of inflation, in the walk of life in which we
are at present marking time.</p>

<p>Indefinite proposals in reference to the prospects of inflation
are rapidly approaching the ludicrous.</p>

<p>Verisimilitude of perspicacity is lent to uncontrolled verbiage
propagated by incomprehensibly improvident intellects that are
manifestly rudimentarily insignificant.</p>

<p>Metaphorically enunciating, inflation is the hallucination of
individuals who seek to extract the oleaginous derivate of the
lacteal fluid directly from the bovine quadruped without the
intervention of the necessary process requisite initially to obtain
the fundamental substance, viz., the lacteal fluid.</p>

<p>If adequate circumvention is not expeditiously promulgated, the
machination of these Mephistophelian devastators must inevitably
culminate in a cataclysmic cataclysm.</p>

<h2>ELECTORS, AWAKE!<br>
THE WALLABIES OF WILLOUGHBY</h2>

<p>It's the open season for kangaroos, 'possums, and wallabies.</p>

<p>We understand that 'possum skins are the most valuable in the
bush (and, speaking of bush, a bird in the hand is worth two in the
bush, but this is not true of emus), the 'possum skins being
extensively worn by fashionable women.</p>

<p>They are also very popular with 'possums.</p>

<p>The usual method of hunting is to "moon" them. You get them
silhouetted against the moon so that if you miss the 'possum you've
got a fair go at the moon.</p>

<p>We have not had much to do with kangaroos, although we once
chased a kangaroo for miles. It bounded along for miles, and we ran
for miles, and we caught it because it was out of bounds.</p>

<p>So far as our knowledge goes, the species of kangaroo which
holds up one side of the shield on a two-bob piece is practically
extinct.</p>

<p>This may be accounted for by the fact that the kangaroo is the
only animal that carries anything in its pouch these days.</p>

<p>But we're well up in wallabies.</p>

<p>Wallabies were first discovered in Willoughby. It is said of
Governor Macquarie that when he first saw a wallaby he shrank back
in alarm.</p>

<p>He said to Governor Bligh, who was present at the time:
"Willoughby safe!"</p>

<p>And it is recorded that Bligh replied: "Wallaby O.K. with
me."</p>

<h2>KLEPTOMANIACS</h2>

<p>For being a kleptomaniac, a man got three years, with bars, at
the Quarter Sessions. The difference between a burglar and a
kleptomaniac is that one does it for a living and the other for a
hobby.</p>

<p>THERE is no fouler collection of meat (apart from tinned dingo)
than a klepto. He will take anything from a dose of castor oil to a
day off.</p>

<p>Caught. red-handed in the act of bearing off a wheat silo, he
will mumble that "a strange feeling" came over him.</p>

<p>We feel a personal peevishness about this because of a certain
packet of cigarettes which we accidentally found in a coat that was
hanging on an infrequently frequented nail.</p>

<p>The office klepto had deviously hidden himself in the wainscote,
watching with small beady eyes. We were robbed.</p>

<p>The unwritten law of the underworld prevented us from opening
our mouth. Case of moral lockjaw.</p>

<p>These people have even been known to take a holiday, no mean
feat, mark you, even in these days of doles. Prominent politicians
have come to us personally, and said that they would "take steps to
have the matter rectified."</p>

<p>We have pointed out the danger of taking steps. Explained that a
man living eight feet from the street level can scarcely devise a
number of steps on the spur of the moment. Steps taken&mdash;liable
to break neck. Great social disadvantage. Kleptomania does not pay.
What did we get on the boss's overcoat?</p>

<h2>FIREMEN OFTEN GO TO BLAZES<br>
OTHERS REMAIN IN SMOKE</h2>

<p>Young, which is a town and not a condition, reports that it has
not had a real fire for the past twelve months.</p>

<p>THIS is a defect which could be easily rectified by anyone with
the proper spirit, preferably methylated.</p>

<p>Having been a fireman for 11 years, we are in a position to
state that a fire is the worst thing that can happen to a
fireman.</p>

<p>Imagine yourself sitting behind three Aces and a pair of Jacks
with 11/9 in the kitty and some mug phones about a fire in Oomble
Street.</p>

<p>The engine you have been polishing every day for six months has
to be brought out and has its polish ruined.</p>

<p>We remember the time when a fire broke out in our fire station
and the blaze was discovered just in time to ruin everything by
water.</p>

<p>Which was luck enough, but we couldn't have a sale.</p>

<p>We shall never forget the time when a gentleman said to the
brigade, "Vill you spray some vater on them ungetriddable socks.
Othervise, ve'll never be able to get rid of 'em as slightly
damaged by water."</p>

<p>It is untrue that a fireman takes his hat off with a
tin-opener.</p>

<p>Firemen can get dressed in 30 seconds. This sounds a bit
hurried, but imagine the long sleep they can have when they are
taking their wives to the pictures.</p>

<p>After every fire a fireman hangs his hose up, whether it's
Christmas or not. We gave up being a fireman some time ago.</p>

<p>For one thing, the suspense of waiting for no fires to happen
ruined our nervous system, and another thing, we got three
convictions for selling Police and Firemen's Art Union tickets
within a hundred yards of a policeman who wanted to be
promoted.</p>

<p>And another thing, nobody's going to tell us to go to
blazes.</p>

<h2>A TIP FOR THE TREASURER<br>
MAKING MONEY WITH BICYCLES</h2>

<p>"I started out to ride around the world on a bicycle in 1908. I
left Melbourne with a penny in my pocket, and after working my way
across Africa, England, and America, I arrived back in Melbourne in
1914 with 4/6." Thus Mr. H. A. Tipper has just come to town with an
assortment of bicycles.</p>

<p>WITH all due respect to Mr. Tipper, we should like to relate how
we started out with fourpence on four bicycles, went four times
round the world backwards, and came back 18/&mdash;in debt.</p>

<p>Then there was the time we had eightpence and started off on
eight bicycles&mdash;but we will not weary you (Oh, NO!)</p>

<p>What we don't know about bicycles is known only to the bicycle
itself. We have ridden bicycles down till the spokes were mere
stubs and the handle-bars were dragging on the ground.</p>

<p>We started on a cyclone (from "cycl," meaning cycle, and "one,"
meaning one&mdash;a one-wheeled bicycle). Then we invented the
gravity-bike. This could be ridden down-hill only.</p>

<p>However, it was not until we got to the motor-cycle stage that
we really prospered. At first they were fairly popular, breaking
down in fairly populous places, and thus enabling the rider to
display his vocabulary to the admiring populace.</p>

<p>Later we added side-cars, complete with cycles, which broke down
in the bush somewhere about Penrith.</p>

<p>Our real triumph was the bicycle wheel which spoke for
itself.</p>

<p>Of course we innovated (a good word) the Spring seats. They were
not much good in the Winter.</p>

<p>But we are afraid that in our enthusiasm we have wandered a
little from the point.</p>

<p>Our suggestion is that, following the lines of Mr. Tipper, the
Treasurer start out with 7/6 on 120 bicycles and go 3000 times
around the world and come back with sufficient to pay the national
debt.</p>

<p>And even if he never came back...?</p>

<p>TUSH! What's a few bicycles?</p>

<h2>MONEY BOX AS BAIT</h2>

<p>Great excitement was caused in Port Macquarie on Thursday night,
when Mr. R. G. Davidson landed a 56 lb. jewfish from the verandah
of his residence, facing the harbour.</p>

<p>Before retiring for the night, Mr. Davidson set his bait, the
alarm being his little girl's money-box fastened to the line.</p>

<p>THIS is not the first jewfish to be landed with a money-box
bait. Nor is it the first one to be caught from a harbour-side
verandah.</p>

<p>We once baited a set line with a money box, and the jewfish, an
old depositor weighing 10st. 11lb., fell for it, and the verandah
was towed 11 miles out to sea.</p>

<p>We shall never forget it. It was a rough night, and the horizon
was entirely obscured by the head of the jewfish and a few
clouds.</p>

<p>A few words passed between the haggard crew on the verandah.
There was only one of us who knew how to steer a verandah. That was
me.</p>

<p>"Haul in on the awnings!" we shouted. "Belay the cane chair
abaft!" This was done&mdash;and not a moment too soon. The fish
turned and came racing towards us.</p>

<p>"Shift the verandah about a mile and a half to the left!" we
bellowed. Too late. The fish landed on the verandah, spat out the
money-box, and said: "Me&mdash;with 35 pounds in the Government
Savings Bank and you toss me a money-box with 1/9 in it!..."</p>

<p>We remembered no more until be found ourself on the beach with a
voice saying, "Drink this."</p>

<p>Oh, to hear that voice again!</p>

<p>It may sound absurd to you, but we can show you the place where
it got away.</p>

<h2>GOLF ON THE OCEAN WAVE</h2>

<p>We are impressed by the puerility of the efforts of Messrs.
Hagen and Kirkwood, professional golfers, who while travelling on
the Aorangi, hit 1000 golf balls into the ocean between Honolulu
and Suva.</p>

<p>ANYONE who couldn't hit a ball into the ocean would have to be
paralysed in both temples. You couldn't possibly miss it.</p>

<p>And yet these men are champion golfers! They must keep in
practice, we admit, but why not try something more difficult? In a
long sporting career, during which we have rung the bell four times
at the shooting gallery, gone down four snakes in the Tasmanian
All-comers' Ludo Championship, and then won, won two aluminium
saucepans on a chocolate wheel for a measly expenditure of 3 pounds
5 shillings&mdash;we have also holed out in one on the golf machine
in the nearby hotel.</p>

<p>We know something about golf. The last time we practised on
shipboard we put up a record for the cruise. Taking our stymie
firmly in both hands, we drove off from the stern, a perfect bunker
shot. It took us two to get into the first deck chair. From there
we unfortunately sliced into the for'ard lifeboat. But got out of
it in five.</p>

<p>It took us 15 to get out of the stokehold after we had driven
one into the funnel.</p>

<p>Understand that we are speaking in minutes all the time.</p>

<p>The bridge of the Aorangi is difficult. Only by constant
practice can one master it. It was on the fourth trip that we holed
out in one.</p>

<p>But why go on with it?</p>

<p>(Echo answers appropriately.) Sufficient to say that slap-stick
golf, belting balls into the bosom of the boundless deep, is no
game for champions.</p>

<p>We ask Hagen and Kirkwood (or, in case we don't see them, you
ask them) to think of the fish.</p>

<p>Ask them (Hagen or Kirkwood, or if you don't see Hagen, tell
Kirkwood to ask Hagen) how would they like a dong in the gills with
a golf ball?</p>

<h2>HOW CAN YOU TELL IF YOU ARE SILLY?</h2>

<p>We are getting a bit nervous about this agitation to revise the
lunacy laws. So far, we are still at large, along with a lot of
other people, but you never know.</p>

<p>A MAN who makes laws compelling you to vote yourself into
misery, or be fined 2 pounds, is capable of anything.</p>

<p>It is so hard to tell when a man has the bats.</p>

<p>The questioning method is not much good.</p>

<p>This sort of thing:</p>

<p>"Is your father sane?"</p>

<p>"Sayin' what?"</p>

<p>"I mean, is there any insanity in your family?"</p>

<p>"Our family has always been sanitary."</p>

<p>"Was your great-grandmother a Moron?"</p>

<p>"No. She was a Presbyterian."...that sort of thing gets you
nowhere.</p>

<p>Actions count more than words. Only yesterday we met a friend
who knew us well, and we asked him for a loan of a tenner.</p>

<p>He said, "Certainly!" and gave it to us. We blanched with fear,
and grasping the note, hurried away.</p>

<p>We're going to avoid that man for the future.</p>

<p>The surest way to discover a lunatic is to place before him his
income tax assessment, his gas bill, rent bill, electric light
bill, etcetera.</p>

<p>If he leaps up and sings, "Happy Days Are Here Again!" and walks
to the rathouse under his own power&mdash;he's sane.</p>

<p>If he sits down, places his forehead in his hand, and says,
"Lor, I dunno what I'm going to do about this," and starts
searching his pockets, he's raving mad, and should be given the
full rights of a citizen of our glorious Commonwealth.</p>

<h2>NEW POINTS ON PRICKLY PEAR</h2>

<p>Almost any minute, now, we expect a big trek to Moree. The
Prickly Pear Destruction Commission's headquarters are being
removed to Sydney, but poison will be distributed from Moree Lands
Office.</p>

<p>Not that we are particularly in need of poison at the moment.
The wife is making a crab savory for to-night.</p>

<p>It puzzles us why any farmer should want to poison himself just
because he has prickly pear. They must be a pretty weak-kneed
lot.</p>

<p>There is nothing really wrong with prickly pear. It is a quiet,
home-loving vegetable with knobs on. Different if it went about the
country hurling itself on to lonely travellers and prickling them
to death.</p>

<p>It could be put to commercial use. The prickles are useful for
gramophone needles, and the leaves for fly-swatters, door-stops, or
the ends of canoe paddles.</p>

<p>Strange why people immediately fly to poison when they get
prickly pear. "Suicide while temporarily paired," is a verdict all
too common in our Coroner's Court. One reads on the tombstone:</p>

<p>"Here lies Martha and John Okus; The cactus cowed us, cooked us,
and croaked us."</p>

<p>A bit sad, but after all, said he, throwing the gun back into
the drawer, perhaps the easier way out.</p>

<p>The time for planting cactus is about now.</p>

<p>The poison may be obtained from the Moree Lands Office.</p>

<p>Get cactus-conscious!</p>

<h2>THE BACHELORS' GUIDE TO THE CARE OF THE YOUNG</h2>

<p>I have noticed with astonishment the absolute ignorance of
bachelors in regard to the care of the young.</p>

<p>To begin at the beginning. It will be noticed in a fresh baby
that it is of a pale, prawn-like colour, and is bald and toothless,
exhibiting all the evidences of senility. This is the usual thing
and the minder is not to be alarmed.</p>

<p>The first thing noticeable about the baby is the yowl. This must
be stopped at all costs. There are various methods, but the
principle to keep in mind is&mdash;at all costs. Watches are very
good; a firm hold must be kept on the chain, however, as I have on
two occasions lost a petfectly good watch through the child
swallowing it.</p>

<p>This mania for swallowing and sucking things may be indulged to
an almost unlimited extent. Door-knobs are excellent, though the
holding of the baby to the knob is somewhat tiring.</p>

<p>This may be overcome by unscrewing the hinges of the door and
placing it in an accessible position.</p>

<p>Babies of an artistic nature, or of practically any nature, may
be left with a tin of stove-polish or a bottle of red ink or any
other medium for an almost indefinite period.</p>

<p>In cases of persistent howling, a belt passed over the top of
the head and buckled securely under the chin is an infallible
remedy. This must be used only in extreme cases.</p>

<p>In handling, care must be taken that the baby is held in a more
or less vertical position, the head being uppermost. The child at
times has a tendency to jerk from the holder, and in the case of a
beginner this may lead to disastrous results. Sticking-plaster and
other first-aid appliances will be found very useful on these
occasions, and a supply should always be kept on hand.</p>

<p>Where a baby has to be held for any length of time, a short loop
of stout twine passed around the neck, and fastened to the wrist of
the holder, will prevent contact with the floor.</p>

<p>Never allow a dog to lick the face of a baby, as any number of
diseases may be communicated, and, in the case of a valuable dog,
this is most serious, and may lead to its loss or, at best, a
falling-off of condition, and an absence of lustre in the coat.</p>

<p>On two or three occasions I have found the addition of about
one-third of a cupful of rum to the feeding milk very effective.
Only the best O.P. rum may be used, as babies are very delicately
constituted internally. A better way is for the minder to have four
or five cupfuls himself, when it will be found that an
extraordinary number of ways of amusing the child will suggest
themselves.</p>

<p>Should the little one inadvertently eat anything it shouldn't,
thoroughly rinse or gargle the mouth with phenol, lysol, or any
other good disinfectant.</p>

<p>In undressing the baby for the purposes of putting it to bed,
bathing, etcetera, the beginner will find great difficulty in
undoing the numerous buttons, tapes, and various other fastenings
with which it is lashed.</p>

<p>An efficient and obvious method is to insert a penknife between
the skin and the clothing and peel the mass off in one
operation.</p>

<p>In bathing the child, never fill the bath right up, as it is
only in exceptional cases that it will float. A cold shower and a
brisk rub down with a stiff towel will have an invigorating and
tonic effect.</p>

<p>In conclusion, a little helpful advice to the unwilling minder
will not be amiss. Should you have been lured into minding a baby
before, and wish to escape a second demand, a convincing excuse
must be made. Lodge meetings and appointments, business or
otherwise, are received with suspicion. By far the best is the
statement that you feel your diphtheria coming back, and that you
seem to be breaking out in funny red spots all over the body. This
may be said in a conversational manner just as the request is about
to be sprung. I have used this or something similar for some time
now, and it has never failed yet.</p>

<h2>LOSERS AND LOTTERY</h2>

<p>Interviewed by our Exceptional Correspondent, one of the losers
of the State Lottery was somewhat shy.</p>

<p>Asked what he intended to do, the almost frantic loser said that
he intended to buy an hotel. It was his intention to buy it one
beer at a time.</p>

<p>Mrs. K, of Lakemba, admits that had an 8 been a 5 and the 31
been a 13, she would have been very close to a 10/&mdash;prize.</p>

<p>Mr. L., of Maroubra, has decided to buy an orange and settle
down.</p>

<p>"I have always had a longing to travel," said the loser of the
third prize. "I think I will take a trip around the bathroom." Mr.
L. will be accompanied by his son, Master M.</p>

<p>"I am very glad&mdash;not for myself alone&mdash;that our
syndicate failed to draw a prize in the lottery," said Mrs. J. "The
losing of the prize delights me, as all the rest of the syndicate
are very annoyed."</p>

<p>The general consensus of opinion is that there is a hole in the
barrel, and that Mr. Whiddon is in the pay of the Soviet
Government.</p>

<h2>LEFT WITH THE LOOT</h2>

<p>We are undone!</p>

<p>An agent who has been circularising America and Canada for
subscribers to the N.S.W. State Lottery, was asking two dollars a
ticket, which is 13/4 in Australian money, at the present rate of
exchange. Mr. Whiddon notified the Police Department.</p>

<p>THIS is rather a dirty trick on ourself, as we have sold a
ticket in Russia, and the 335,000,000,000,000 roubles are now being
unloaded at Darling Harbor.</p>

<p>Not that it matters such a great deal in this case, because we
have the roubles, but we don't like to let our customers down. Take
our German circular, for instance: "Investen inder Staten-housen
Lottery blitzen. Firstun Prizen, 11 billion marks. Enclosen
abouterung 2,000,000 marks for tickethoff."</p>

<p>The trusting Teuton goes out into the back yard, and loads the
van with the 5/3. The dumping on to the trucks&mdash;the merry
"Hello, you&mdash;scab!" of the wharf-laborers; the strike of the
stokers; the quaint old-world chant as they wind up the cutlass,
and heave the anchor, and away, away. All this stuff costs
money.</p>

<p>We recently sent a ticket to Lisbon, 109 3/4 escudos to the
pound. If he wins, how do we stand? This leather-lunged lotterier,
as Mr. Theodore might say, does not give us agents a fair go.</p>

<p>There can be 814 winners in the lottery. As for the other
99,186&mdash;we are willing to give same-day service.</p>

<p>All we ask is a fair go.</p>

<h2>THESE ERUDITE BARBERS</h2>

<p>Barbers have been listed in the American census under the
heading, "domestic and personal service."</p>

<p>THEY claim that they are professional men, because they have to
study bacteriology, anatomy of the upper body, histology of the
hair and skin, and scientific manipulation of the muscles of the
head and face.</p>

<p>Perhaps we shouldn't have mentioned it, because it might start
Australian barbers on the same path. They have to study hard enough
as it is, what with dandruff-divining, blackhead-stalking,
elocution, racing form, meteorology, and that form of hypnosis by
which they convince you that if you don't have a shampoo they will
not be responsible for what happens to you.</p>

<p>We picture the time when the patient will be led into the
barber's surgery by a nurse and told to strip.</p>

<p>The barber will then put him under the microscope, take his
blood pressure, examine his moustache for signs of incipient
tobacco-stains, and tell him that he ought to eat more green
foods.</p>

<p>He will then gravely announce that he has diagnosed the trouble
as progressive hirsute growth on the face, and that its immediate
removal is necessary.</p>

<p>The customer will grow pale as death as they wheel him into the
barber's saloon to be chloroformed.</p>

<p>The nurse will then hand the barber his towels, soap, brush,
etcetera, and the customer will come out of the
anaesthetic&mdash;shaved.</p>

<p>And the barber will send his account along later on. Eh?</p>

<p>(No. We thought there was a catch in it.)</p>

<h2>A AND Y AMBITIONS AT SCHOOL LEFT US COLD</h2>

<p>We knew we'd be found out eventually. Lord Baden-Powell, on his
75th birthday, said that modern boys have less ambition than
formerly, and are inclined to self-indulgence and luxury.</p>

<p>When we were a boy, confront us with a bag of bulls' eyes and a
good place where they had green apricots and a hole in the fence,
and our ambition got nebulous all over.</p>

<p>At school we were good at transitory verbs.</p>

<p>Algebra, on the other hand, we regarded as a sort of
mathematician's Esperanto.</p>

<p>Whether A plus 2 equalled Y minus 1 left us still mending our
catapult. Our attitude toward A and Y was, "Let 'em."</p>

<p>That at 1066 p.m. William the Conqueror landed in
England&mdash;well, we were delighted to hear about it, so we bit a
piece out of our pear, and put it back under our desk. Our ambition
at school was to spit farther than anybody else in the district. So
much for ambition.</p>

<p>Luxuries? Well, one of the big boys had a girl's garter. We have
since thought that his mother discarded it, and we were robbed. We
bought it off him for 100 marbles and a three weeks' mortgage on
our Sunday school money.</p>

<p>That was a long time ago. We have had real live pairs of them
since, and now that we're getting old we sometimes sit down and
suck our pipe and wish that we had our marbles back.</p>

<p>ANYHOW, if we had a son who didn't have an entire lack of
ambition at school, and was not possessed of an awful and burning
desire for luxury&mdash;we'd be looking at him with two eyes full
of suspicion.</p>

<h2>A LESSON ON LIONS</h2>

<p>Montreal, April 30.</p>

<p>A lion cub, which, with several other wild animals, was being
used for lecture and exhibition purposes at Whittier School, in
Cincinnati, leaped upon Vivian Leichner, seven years, and injured
her critically.</p>

<p>THIS reminds us of the time we went to school in Africa. We had
a lion which wanted to be very much attached to us. Wherever we
went, the lion was sure to go. It followed us to school one day (we
were always about three laps in front of it), and we sooled it on
to the teacher, who lectured to us about it.</p>

<p>"That, children, is a lion," he said, clinging tightly to the
school belfry.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," we replied, from the adjoining roof.</p>

<p>"You have frequently read of the of the rolling deep and the
bounding main, upon which sailors profess great anxiety to
live.</p>

<p>"That, children, is the bounding mane...are there any sailors
present?</p>

<p>"No? Very well. The animal you see before you is somewhat
similar to a second-hand car, in that it cannot travel far without
paws. The skin, if of the lion, makes an excellent hearth-rug if
the lion is emptied out of it.</p>

<p>"There is not a great deal of trade done in lions; hunters
usually shoot them and leave them where they lie. Hence the term
'lion.' Now, children, are there any questions?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," we shrieked. "In view of the present situation, may
we have the rest of the day off?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "the class may dismiss!"</p>

<p>No...the teacher was saved. The lion got killed in the rush.</p>

<h2>WOOL AND WHAT IT ALL MEANS</h2>

<p>To-day Wool Week begins, but just because you're wearing a
woollen singlet you needn't look sheepish.</p>

<p>Wool is our greatest product next to mutton. Woolgrowing is the
laziest occupation in the world, as the sheep does all the growing
part and the owner merely goes out at intervals and tears the wool
off the sheep.</p>

<p>The primitive method of hand-plucking has long been out of date,
but as yet no one has invented a fleece for sheep on the hook and
eye principle. Buttons along the back of the sheep are obviously
impracticable. A man can't go chasing sheep about the place every
time they lose a button.</p>

<p>For a long time we have been advocating the putting of red
stripes on each end of sheep intended for making blankets.</p>

<p>This would save putting them on later. The stripes on blankets
are necessary, of course, so people will be able to tell the top
and bottom ends of the bed, and will not retire crossways.</p>

<p>Sheep frequently get tick, in which they are far superior to us,
we being unable to get it anywhere. They also get burrs (some of
the sheep in Scotland are barely understandable). and dirt in the
fleece.</p>

<p>This need not worry those intending to buy a woollen singlet, as
most of these foreign bodies are taken out of the singlet when it
is made, and what few burrs are left occasion very little
discomfort unless they happen to be under the armpits.</p>

<h2>TOPWEIGHT SNAIL'S GREAT RUN</h2>

<p>A wanderer in the wilds of Parramatta has returned with the
report that a number of the unemployed residents of the district
were observed crowding around five snails, which were crawling
towards a cabbage leaf.</p>

<p>The betting was described as "frantic."</p>

<p>If it is to be revived, we should like to see this old sport put
on a proper footing. Dirty tactics, like putting lime on the track
just near the home turn, and ringing-in periwinkles, should not be
tolerated.</p>

<p>A glaring instance of roguery will be remembered by old-timers
when the old Central Snailway was in existence.</p>

<p>In a handicap event, Slobber, a very poor performer, who had
been brought down from the country, was the medium of some heavy
plunges, and romped home in front of a classy field.</p>

<p>The stewards found at the inquiry that Slobber's shell had been
shaved down, and the owner, trainer and snall were disqualified for
life.</p>

<p>The Carbine of all snails was Greasy, who humped his shell, and
half an ounce of chewing gum, over a fifty-yard course and finished
in the remarkable time of 2 days 21 hours dead.</p>

<p>He was never any good after this supreme effort.</p>

<p>A badly trained snail is a cow to play up at the barrier, and
keeping this in mind, it would be well for owners to have their
snails trained from the time they are slugs.</p>

<h2>ENGLISH, AS SHE IS SPOKE, ARE DREADFUL</h2>

<p>To-morrow night the Violet League will debate in the lecture
hall of the School of Arts the question, "Is the use of correct
English necessary?"</p>

<p>TO which we reply, too eyes right, it is.</p>

<p>A man who can't spill a sentence without crashing on his aitches
ought to be took away from where he is &amp; have it learnt to him
at a school.</p>

<p>Now a scholar what stretched his ear when he was a kid &amp;
listened&mdash;in all he knew, why, that boy will talk the
perfectest English and get away with it.</p>

<p>Just the same, there's too much class distinction in
English.</p>

<p>One bloke'll say, "I were going down the road," &amp; another
puts him to right and says, "You WAS going down the road!"</p>

<p>And probably all the time, the man was telling lies &amp; he
never even seen the road. All me eye, that's what it is.</p>

<p>"I am going to eat an apple"; "You are going to eat an apple,"
and all that. I AINT going to eat a apple. I don't go much on
apples.</p>

<p>Now, suppose you got a crack on the bugle from a cove, you
wouldn't get up and say, "You have seen fit to assault me, for no
apparent reason. I shall immediately proceed to punish you as you
deserve."</p>

<p>No. You'd just say, "Right! You cow!" &amp; be into him.</p>

<p>We're in favour of proper English so long as it aint overdone,
&amp; having put the kybosh on the argument, we advise the Violet
League to call off the dogs.</p>

<p>The debate is settled.</p>

<h2>UNPAID TAXES</h2>

<p>Some councils have allowed rate-payers, by toiling in some civic
capacity, to cut out accounts which they have no cash to pay. An
extension of this scheme would open up some interesting
possibilities. &mdash;News Item.</p>

<p>IT would, too. If the scheme catches on, we are going to paint
the outside of the Income Tax Office to cut out our income tax. If
the idea becomes fashionable, public servants will have to hack
their way into their offices through 14 feet of solid paint.</p>

<p>All the wood-blocks in the city could be taken up by ratepayers
in arrears with their rates, and laid down by another gang of
ratepapers, equally in arrears.</p>

<p>This would not cause unemployment among the road-menders, as the
City Council would tear them up again straight away, according to
Immemorial custom.</p>

<p>We could even tend parks and gardens, although what a tree would
look like after 11,000 taxpayers had had a go at trimming it we do
not know.</p>

<p>We know that more than 11,000 are up a tree, but we have not
seen the tree.</p>

<p>Ushering in the Bankruptcy Court we are also willing to take
on.</p>

<p>As for ourself, we are willing to write front-page articles
about suburban aldermen, and what they think about the state of the
footpath in Fuchsia Street.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, we are even prepared to collect our own
fares on the trams, direct our own traffic, work off our dog
license money by a brief spell In the Dogs' Home, and help to
control the queues at the Labor Bureau In order to save our wage
tax.</p>

<p>We object, however, helping move our time-payment furniture out
of the home to save bailiff's expenses.</p>

<p>There is a limit to everything.</p>

<h2>RULES FOR HUSBANDS</h2>

<p>A big mistake has been made by Albert Ross, of Jersey City,
U.S.A.</p>

<p>HIS bride drew up 47 rules for their mutual guidance, which
rules included everything from attending churth to the division of
salary.</p>

<p>Until he signed, his wife refused to kiss him. Albert refused to
sign, and the marriage was annulled.</p>

<p>We signed. Anyone puts anything up to us and says, "Sign this!"
we always sign it. It's most exciting. We never know whether we are
going to have a time-payment gramophone delivered next day or a
block of land, or be arrested.</p>

<p>What we signed was something about, "You will not walk on the
carpet. You will not splash any water on the bathroom floor when
taking a shower. You will refrain from sitting on the edge of the
bed after it has been made.</p>

<p>"You will not touch the decanter, which is for the visitors. You
will not burn holes in the lounge; you will not dirty my clean
ash-trays; you will always wipe your muddy boots before you come
in.</p>

<p>"You will not leave any doors open, or go about the place
switching lights on and not switching them off.</p>

<p>"No throwing of clothes all over the floor when getting
undressed, no taking the matches from the kitchen, no being nasty
to my mother: you will not encourage my brother to drink, and you
will not be more than three-quarters of a minute late for
dinner."</p>

<p>And, believe us, we have had more fun breaking those rules than
anything else you could think of. Only trouble is, we are running
short of rules.</p>

<h2>LOWER KHAYYAM TELLS OF CUP<br>
HE LETS JULIUS CEASE AND BYRON BAY</h2>

<p>Verse and Worse.</p>

<p>FRIENDS, typists, plumbers, clerks, Romans, commercial
travellers, and countrymen!</p>

<p>Whoever wins the Melbourne Cup sweep today must naturally be
suspected.</p>

<p>We have not come here to bury Caesar, but to tell him a good
thing.</p>

<p>Now that the autumn wanes and summer fries Across the vast
horizon on the beaches The people bake; rushing, now, and ever and
anon, To the pub to quench the thirst brought on By asking those
who do not know, results Of races which they have no interest
in.</p>

<p>And who shall say them neigh? Not US, who, with half-dollars in
the pool, Must, for our money's sake, Seek the promoter lest he get
away. And thus, five hundred miles away, in summer, As the blow
flies, fast speeds the jockey on his guarded steed.</p>

<p>In Melbourne...(Listen. We're getting sick of this. We are
working under a strain. We are in a half-crown sweep and have drawn
Tregilla.) And shall Tregilla die! (Cornish.) Fifty mounted
policemen can't be wrong! (Phar-Laplandish.)</p>

<p>Who knows where all this will end?</p>

<p>What will become of our half-crown and your two bob?</p>

<p>Life's but a chequer-board of whites and bays,<br>
And man's binoculars he glady pawns,<br>
...But Abrahams, who gladly lays fives on the field,<br>
He knows it all-he nose, he nose!</p>

<p>Anyhow, we have a bit each way. We have not yet paid in our
half-dollar to the sweep promoter. Thus are the fates thwarted by
human ingenuity.</p>

<p>Hoping you are the same...</p>

<h2>AN APPEAL FOR MODERATION</h2>

<p>We are perturbed at a sinister move, moved by the Master
Plumbers' and Sanitary Engineers' Association.</p>

<p>The association suggests that the populace should have a bath a
day.</p>

<p>With the winter coming on!</p>

<p>Much better to be re-ducoed twice a year. It is a well-known
fact that we breathe through the pores of the skin, which open and
shut with monotonous regularity. How can a pore breathe under
water?</p>

<p>Plumbers may come and sanitary inspectors may go, but the pore
we have always with us. (Classical quotation.)</p>

<p>Why should water be poured on the poor pore every day?</p>

<p>Consider soap. Stand back a bit and have a look at it.</p>

<p>We know a man named Albert Fruggle, who got soap in his eye and
was only just saved from going blind by a specialist, who
recommended a course of front seats at a revue. Even more tragic
was the case of Esteban Smith, who stood up to wash under his
knees, slipped on the soap, and broke his neck on the tap.</p>

<p>(Poor old Esteban...but this is no time for grief.)</p>

<p>We mentioned something about sinister movements, earlier in the
recitation. Get this into your skull:</p>

<p>There's going to be a civil war when the supporters of the Bath
a Day movement start wearing badges with the letters "B.A.D." on
them.</p>

<p>We foresee political upheavals at the Trades Hall when it is
discovered that trusted members have gone over to the B.A.D.
section.</p>

<p>We do not wish to cause alarm, but it seems to us that the bath
a day suggestion is just the thin end of the wedge, which will lead
on to a cold shower every morning.</p>

<p>We advise caution. Wet the eyes with one end of a towel. Ruffle
the hair. Come out of the bathroom, panting. In other words, be
with the moderates.</p>

<p>If you MUST sing. REMEMBER...sheet music.</p>

<p>You can sing it in bed.</p>

<h2>GOLF</h2>

<p>We're sick of golf. We've never, played; but still, that doesn't
prevent us from being sick.</p>

<p>Sent to the Moore Park links yesterday morning to watch Jimmy
Pike and partner play fellow jockey Cook and friend.</p>

<p>They were a bit late, so we went away. Very lucky escape it
was.</p>

<p>Do you know that it's nearly two miles around that course, and
mostly uphill? And that is as the crow flies, mark you. And we make
bold to assert that even a crow would kick at all that uphill
stuff.</p>

<p>There's not a solitary tram on the course. If you want to go
from one hole to another, you've got to walk. You can't go wrong in
believing us when we tell you that we were astonished.</p>

<p>We saw a few golfers wandering about the place while we were
there. They wear their trousers tucked into their socks. We suppose
this is on account of the grasshoppers. They carry a bag of tools
with them for the purpose of hitting a ball into small holes which
are bored in the ground by artificial means.</p>

<p>When two are playing together they have a ball each in order to
prevent quarelling.</p>

<p>The method of hitting the ball is simple. One selects,
haphazard, one of the bats from the container. The next move is to
arrange the legs fairly wide apart, so that there is no possibility
of falling over. The blunt instrument is then lifted above the head
and the ball is struck. This counts one. Not once did we notice a
player count it two. Which shows that these people are at least
honest and have some sort of rough code of ethics.</p>

<p>Having struck the ball, the golfer then walks after it. Having
caught up to it, he then strikes it again. This goes on
indefinitely.</p>

<p>We can see now that polo was invented by a golfer who woke up to
himself.</p>

<p>We must reluctantly admit that we cannot recommend the game of
golf.</p>

<p>It has but one redeeming feature. We understand that when any
player puts his ball into a hole in one swipe, or "holes out in
one," as they quaintly put it, everybody immediately gets
drunk.</p>

<p>Well, of course, that's something.</p>

<h2>CAN YOU BITE THE BACK OF YOUR OWN NECK?</h2>

<p>To sit on your own lap! It seems an impossible feat. But that is
what Ruth Chatterton does in "The Right to Love." She plays the
daughter and mother. This achievement is due to the Dunning
process, a new and remarkable discovery.</p>

<p>S0 there you are. But do we stop there? No Science must march
on.</p>

<p>We are now in the throes of discovering the Lower process, by
means of which man will be enabled to take a running jump at
himself.</p>

<p>What would his Neanderthal forefathers say to that?</p>

<p>Furthermore, the time is not far distant when Science will grant
to man the inestimable boon of being able to bite himself on the
back of the neck at any hour of the day or night!</p>

<p>In our laboratories&mdash;the very same one in which a young
doctor, a martyr to science, gave himself freckles in order to
study the effects &mdash;in our laboratories we are now gradually
getting into shape the culminating triumph.</p>

<p>It is so big that we are almost afraid to give it to the
world.</p>

<p>After years of experiment, we have almost perfected a process
whereby a man can go through his own pockets while he is
asleep!</p>

<p>This will make man practically self-contained and will do away
with the necessity for marriage and probably wreck the social
structure of our time.</p>

<p>But let there be no dismay. One must have a wife, because the
machine will never be invented that can find your back stud.</p>

<p>Saying which, he strode thoughtfully back to his test-tubes.</p>

<h2>AN ADMISSION OF ANCESTRY<br>
HOW ONE BECOMES REINCARNATED</h2>

<p>The statements of Mrs. Annie Besant and Bishop Leadbeater, that
they remember every one of their lives and reincarnations right
back to the time when they were slimy, lizard-like creatures,
encourages us to make a few admissions of our own.</p>

<p>We were once a sponge cake.</p>

<p>We remember as if it was yesterday, lying there in that
prehistoric refreshment room for months and months and months; it
might have been years.</p>

<p>Then came our first reincarnation. We were taken down, dusted,
and put in among the rock cakes. We forget exactly how long after
that we were donated to the soup kitchen.</p>

<p>From then on, our reincarnations were rapid. From a rock cake we
became an attack of indigestion, after, which we were a jelly-fish,
a politician, a vulture, and a rhinocerous.</p>

<p>Improving all the time, you'll notice.</p>

<p>It was just when we had finished being a rhinocerous that
complications set in. Fate seemed undecided whether it would make
us a hip-bath or a sewing machine.</p>

<p>We finished up as a glugflobber, a rather curious animal which
lives solely on bicycle-pumps and the black portions of draught
boards. Its only means of propulsion is to make a loud noise behind
its own back, thus frightening itself into taking a leap
forward.</p>

<p>Need we tell you of the various stages we passed through? Of
when we were a freedlupper, wheeling our ego in front of us and
spearing complexes with our sharp-pointed inhibitions? No. We
needn't.</p>

<p>But there is one thing we should like to explain. It is about
the time when we were Lord Nelson. We did NOT put the telescope to
our blind eye and say, "I see no signals."</p>

<p>We put the telescope to our good eye and said, "I see no (hic!)
shignals." After this we got properly shot, and as we fell to the
deck Hardy bent over us and we said, "Hiccups, Hardy."</p>

<p>And Hardy, misunderstanding, kissed us.</p>

<p>We are now on our present plane. It is only a matter of time
when we shall reach the pinnacle toward which civilisation has been
gradually forging all these countless ages.</p>

<p>We shall become one of the unemployed.</p>

<p>And, on that plane, there is nothing but eternal rest.</p>

<h2>BANANAS IN BOOTEES</h2>

<p>"It would be extremely interesting to carry out experiments by
covering bananas likely to mature during the winter months with
bags."</p>

<p>IT would be interesting, but somewhat tedious, putting the
little chaps into their bags. They're bound to grow out of them,
and there's nothing looks more slovenly than a banana with an
ill-fitting bag.</p>

<p>They look very chic in knitted bootees, but the question of
expense must be considered.</p>

<p>It would be even more interesting to put goloshes on potatoes
during the rainy season, while it would be positively thrilling to
fit the water-melons with double-breasted coats.</p>

<p>We have recently been concentrating on beans.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that we were the first beaniarist to
produce the Scarlet Runner. We trained it to run so fast that
snails dropped exhausted in its tracks.</p>

<p>Perhaps in our zeal we overdid the thing. Our last crop had to
be picked by bean pickers on motor cycles.</p>

<p>We dabbled a little in marrows last season, but the ants were so
annoying we had to blow up the one we hollowed out for a garage. As
a sideline we have been working on an odorless onion.</p>

<p>We have also planted a tomato which has not yet come up.
Everything points to success.</p>

<h2>SIMPLE TALK ON DRESS</h2>

<p>There is nothing more soul-shattering than to discover that you
are wearing two left boots.</p>

<p>We are moved to mention this because Miss Dorothy Brunton in
yesterday's paper said that "One's clothes shape one's mental
outlook." Which is true. Look at the difference in mental outlook
when a man wears his collar back to front!</p>

<p>Then again, notice when you're pulling your singlet off. For a
moment you've got no outlook at all.</p>

<p>Mind you, it's not only the clothes. There's the manner of
putting them on&mdash;carelessly or otherwise.</p>

<p>A man who puts his arm through one arm-hole of his vest and his
leg through the other, ties the sleeves of his coat around his
waist, and wears his hat round his neck for an amulet, shows a
certain amount of carelessness in his dress which would be
noticeable in very fashionable company.</p>

<p>Then there is the little matter of the socks matching the tie.
This problem may easily be overcome. When buying socks, mention
that you have a one-legged friend who would like a sock of the same
pattern.</p>

<p>You may then wear two of the socks as socks, and the remaining
one as a tie. After the feet-socks have been used for some months,
they may be used as mittens. A good idea is to wear leggings, when
you don't need any socks at all.</p>

<p>It beats us why clothing manufacturers have not made a shirt
which has buttons down the back as well as in front. You could then
wear it back to front when the exposed portion got a bit
mouldy.</p>

<p>Ours not to reason why. We merely remain convinced that, had our
mental outlook been properly clothed earlier, had we, instead of
being attired in two pieces of soft rag and a safety pin, been
clothed in a fireman's helmet at birth, with seaboots, a military
overcoat, and motoring gloves, and eaten our porridge with a
boat-hook, we should not have had to roll our own cigarettes this
day.</p>

<p>MORAL: If you wear your trousers back to front, you have to
kneel down to sit up. (Very deep.)</p>

<h2>THIS GLAND CURE</h2>

<p>While bowling his hoop along George Street, William Hinkler,
aged 105, was knocked down by an armoured 'bus and had his clavicle
bashed in. He is now lying in some place. That is to say, some
other place. His condition is not serious.</p>

<p>If Bill Voronoff keeps on with his gland treatment, this sort of
thing is likely to happen any day. The latest news from Voronoff
(by Borronoff and Sir Otto Anaemia) is that by grafting three
glands on to the aged frame giant men will live to the age of at
least 125 years.</p>

<p>Why in the devil anyone should wish to live in this vale of
gas-bills for 125 years surpasses our scientific knowledge.</p>

<p>In plain words which will touch the hearts of the local
peasantry, it has us stonkered.</p>

<p>Wanted boy, about 50 or 60, excellent opportunities for
advancement. Apply with parents or guardian.</p>

<p>Thus is the excuse of anti-glandists thrown to the ground and
trampled on.</p>

<p>Prolonging life will not cause unemployment. Merely a
readjustment. Lovely word, readjustment. We are feeling a bit
readjusted ourself.</p>

<p>While peddling eggs to his grandmother, Nicholas Moxon, 132, got
his beard caught in the spokes of his tricycle and was thrown to
the ground. At Sydney Hospital, Moxon said that he did not blame
the tricycle.</p>

<p>Constable Smith, who chased accused in a bath chair, having
dropped his gland, has the case in hand.</p>

<p>Developments are expected. Persons having fingerprints are
requested to call at Detective office and be arrested.</p>

<p>Gland treatment should be approached carefully. Sneak up on it
sideways. Those feeling old are recommended to die now. Don't
delay. The price of burial is going up every day. By dying now you
save enormous sums of income tax, etc. Especially, etc.</p>

<p>Die now and save.</p>

<h2>GIRLS, HOW TO ACQUIRE "IT"<br>
FREE BEAUTY SECRETS</h2>

<p>ATTENTION, girls!</p>

<p>Just a few words on how to use your lip-stick and face
powder.</p>

<p>Mr. Ernest Young, a London educationist, has said, "I implore
art teachers to teach girls to use powder and lip-stick
artistically and correctly."</p>

<p>He shall not implore in vain.</p>

<p>First of all it is necessary to have a face, with a mouth in it.
The face should be washed and, if the means are at hand, dried. A
piece of well-chalked string is then tied to one ear, stretched
across the face to the other ear, and then given a slight flip with
the fingers.</p>

<p>This will result in a white chalk-line across the face, which
will give the position for the rouge on the cheeks: The rouge may
be applied with a small mop or a trowel, care being taken to scoop
any surplus out of the ears.</p>

<p>The face is now taken across the dressing room and pushed into
the powder. With the face buried, blow vigorously, thus
distributing the powder all over the face and neck. Some cream the
face before powdering. This gives a nice stucco effect.</p>

<p>Now take the left hand and slide it down the face until you come
to an aperture. This is the mouth.</p>

<p>Work the lip-stick into whatever shape the mouth is to be, and
press it on while still plastic.</p>

<p>When pencilling the eyebrows always use an indelible pencil.
Nothing is more untidy than a girl who, while pushing her hair
back, has wiped one of her eyebrows off. Those lucky girls who can
yawn naturally should add the weeniest touch of rouge to the
tonsils.</p>

<p>That will be all for the present, girls.</p>

<p>Remember&mdash;Art, and plenty of it.</p>

<h2>RABBITS, IF YOU LIKE</h2>

<p>Our rabbit has died.</p>

<p>A bit of a blow after what the National Council of Women
said.</p>

<p>We had great expectations of him, because he was an Angora
rabbit, and we expected to clip wool off him every three months,
according to directions, and export it to cardigan jacket
manufacturers.</p>

<p>Still, we learned a fair bit about rabbits, while he lived. The
Angora rabbit inhabits the mountain fastnesses of Angora, boring
holes into the faces of precipices with its back feet.</p>

<p>This, so that if the rabbit should wish to leave the hole, it
need not turn round. The hole is known as a burrow. The difference
between a burrow and a borrow is that when one wants to burrow one
makes a hole.</p>

<p>When you borrow you're, already in a hole.</p>

<p>Obvious, of course, but we thought we'd point it out to you.</p>

<p>We knew a rabbit once, his name was Alphonso, after the King of
Spain, who recently aspirated&mdash;which is a mos' Spainful
subject.</p>

<p>He (the rabbit) used to dog, or rabbit, our footsteps wherever
we went. Its fleece was white as snow. It followed us to school one
day. We used it to chase ferrets. It was a sad day for us when four
actors came along (and wanted a rabbit's foot each, for luck). It
was bad luck for the rabbit.</p>

<p>We made a cardigan jacket out of the remains.</p>

<p>From the experience we gained on that occasion, we advise all
future rabbit ranchers to take the meat part out of the rabbit
before making a jacket of the fur.</p>

<p>And another thing. One rabbit doesn't go fur enough.</p>

<p>Now, warren know about that!</p>

<h2>SUBSTANTIAL MEALS<br>
RECIPES FROM THE JUNGLE</h2>

<p>We intend to breed elephants for the market. We shall establish
Elephant Clubs and hold laying competitions, awarding blue ribbons
for pure-bred Buff Orpington elephants and tartan ribbons for
crossbreds.</p>

<p>We are driven to this, partly because of the economic depression
and partly because, since the Colonial Exhibition in Paris, "The
strange Oriental dishes of the Exhibition restaurants have created
a taste for exotic food. Lion's flesh is in demand, and elephant's
ears on toast..."</p>

<p>In order to popularise the elephant with the eating public (of
which there is still a large number) we publish a few recipes.</p>

<p>Take one elephant. Peel and soak in a lagoon overnight. Remove
the ears (it is better to do this while the elephant is asleep).
Fry ears to a dull black and throw on top of toast.</p>

<p>Serve hot.</p>

<p>A Good Roast.</p>

<p>JOINT.&mdash;Remove hind leg of elephant. Elephant will fall
over. While in recumbent position, clean and scrape. Take middle
portion of elephant and grease well. Start bush fire. Run for life.
Come back in fortnight's time. (This is good with vegetable
marrows.)</p>

<p>SOUP.&mdash;Take two elephants. Remove tusks and beat into a
stiff froth. Add four gills of crushed bath-heater. Stir well and
skim with long-handled shovel. Simmer for three months. Some add
moth-balls (this is purely a matter of taste).</p>

<p>A touch of lemon is always necessary, otherwise the dish
repeats. The elephant never forgets, but still one doesn't want to
be reminded ALL the time. No.</p>

<h2>EAT MORE ELEPHANTS!<br>
OPPOSITION FOR SYDNEY FERRIES</h2>

<p>There is a ferry boat to be sold at auction on Tuesday.</p>

<p>We shall never forget the last ferry boat we bought.</p>

<p>Carried away in a frenzy of bidding, we found it knocked down to
us at 9 pounds 10 shillings.</p>

<p>"Take it away," said the auctioneer.</p>

<p>Having had some nautical experience, we knew what to do. A bag
of coal cost us 4/6 or something. It was the work of a moment to
stoke the fires.</p>

<p>Then, dashing up to the bridge, we rang the bell for "Slow
ahead." Dashing down to the engine-room just in time to hear the
bell, we put her on to "Slow ahead."</p>

<p>Tearing back to the bridge, we suddenly remembered that we
hadn't cast-off, and immediately rushed to the lower deck in our
capacity as deck-hand, and discovered that the hawser was under too
great a strain to cast off. We hurled ourself up on the bridge and
rang down the order, "Stop. Slow astern."</p>

<p>Leaping frenziedly to the engine-room, we then put her astern,
dashed out of the engine-room, and cast off the mooring ropes. From
there back to the bridge and our position as captain was merely a
matter of agility.</p>

<p>By this time the coal had run out. We spun the wheel 14 times,
failing, however, to rest on a winning number, and thus losing a
box of chocolates.</p>

<p>We finished up adrift in the open sea. The boat sank and we were
drowned with all hands&mdash;both of them.</p>

<p>This concluded our nautical career, and we are lucky to be able
to tell the tale, drowned as we are.</p>

<p>(This venture was a distinct loss to Mr. Lower. Our accountant
has analysed the position with the following result:&mdash;</p>

<p>Depreciation of boat 9 pounds 10 shillings<br>
Cost of coal 4 shillings and 6 pence<br>
Fare paid at turnstile by Mr. Lower 4 pence<br>
Total 9 pounds 14 shillings and 10 pence</p>

<p>Against this the sum of 4 pence, fare received by Captain Lower,
must be offset. Net loss was, therefore, 9 pounds 14 shillings and
6 pence.</p>

<p>Mr. Lower's claim for expenses totalling this amount has been
unanimously rejected.)</p>

<h2>THAT CIRCUS AWARENESS</h2>

<p>Great disappointment yesterday. Went to circus, expecting to see
elephants toddling about their coops, raging lion-tamers annoying
the lions, and dare-devil dervishes hurling knives at each other
from a vast height.</p>

<p>But the carpenters are still rigging the place up. However, we
saw a solitary Russian Cossack&mdash;one of the troupe. A winsome
lad, with a moustache which reminded us of our Uncle Alfred. He
rides four horses at once; somewhat of a waste, but, still, we
suppose he must have comfort.</p>

<p>We said to him, "I suppose you find Sydney a bit warmer than
Melbourne?"</p>

<p>He said, "Zxlhwtxhckxvitchkerenkxzlovor?! 5w/z???"</p>

<p>We threw him one of our sparking smiles and replied, "Yes."</p>

<p>We said to a carpenter, "Where are the Polar bears that ride
bicycles? Where are the elephants that sit up and beg? The lady who
dives 7000 feet into a bucket, and the marvellous, blood-sweating
rhinocerous, which balances a grand piano and three billiard balls
in one paw?"</p>

<p>The carpenter said, "Search me!"</p>

<p>We did not do this, as it was quite plain to our trained
journalistic eye that he did not have a single elephant concealed
upon him.</p>

<p>We borrowed his hammer and thoughtfully cracked a peanut,
without which no circus is complete.</p>

<p>Circuses are not what they used to be. Once we had only to see
the clown fall on his face and we would laugh until we had to be
belted on the back and have brandy forced between our teeth. Now,
if anyone falls over, we go and smell his breath. Cynical, that's
what we are.</p>

<p>This country is not circus-conscious. What we need is more
circuses. Big scale stuff. Saw-dust all over the city. Traffic cops
balancing on the tram wires. Shop-walkers walking about on their
hands. Judges seriously balancing rulers on top of their noses and
placing the inkwell on top of that.</p>

<p>Why, in time our Premier might even be able to balance his
Budget!</p>

<p>We must get out of this slough of whatsisname in which we are
wallowing and learn to hurl Ourself through hoops, wrapped in
flames, into a pondful of seals. Nothing is more refreshing.</p>

<h2>FLAT HEAD, OR FAT HEADS<br>
DISQUISITION ON PHRENOLOGY</h2>

<p>We were surprised to learn that we have a head, the shape of
which is something between a frankfurt and a rockmelon. We had it
measured by a hatter's "conformer" which takes an exact measurement
of the top of the head. And you needn't snigger!</p>

<p>If you only stood up and looked down on the top of your head
you'd be disgusted. In future, we are going to wear a hat with
eye-holes in it, which will tie tightly around the neck (the hat,
not the eye-holes; and, anyhow, if we had said, "going to wear a
hat which will tie tightly around the neck with eye-holes in
it"...you can't have eye-holes in your neck).</p>

<p>A phrenologist once told us about the natives of Central Africa.
Their heads are flat at the back. This is due to the fact that they
can only get tough meat and have no chairs.</p>

<p>Standing up in their huts, dragging at the meat with their
teeth, a piece of the meat eventually comes off, their heads jerk
back and hit the wall of the hut. This goes on three times a day.
Can you wonder that their heads are flat at the back?</p>

<p>Then there are the people whose heads are pushed over to the
side. Being constantly thrown out of boarding houses and pubs on to
their ear gets them this way eventually.</p>

<p>Or, again, we have the people who live in flats, and whose heads
are square or rectangular.</p>

<p>Look at the people who ride in baby cars on country roads with
the hood up. Heads all flat on the top.</p>

<p>By continually raising his eye-brows many a man has worked his
scalp down the back of his neck until it rested in the middle of
his back, and thus gone bald.</p>

<p>We know a bald man who kept on doing this until he eventually
worked his moustache up over his forehead and on to his head, where
it prospered greatly.</p>

<p>So far as reading the character by the bumps on the head, this
can be easily fixed. Any little deficiencies can be put in order by
giving the head a sharp blow in the proper spot with a hammer,
which can be secured at small cost and to suit any pocket. Not that
we advise you to carry the damn thing around in your pocket. Keep
it in your desk. If you're one of these hard-headed business men,
perhaps it would be well to get an anvil also.</p>

<p>That will be all for the present, as the young man said when he
gave his girl a cake of sand-soap for her birthday.</p>

<h2>LET'S BECOME PURER</h2>

<p>Purity is rapidly becoming fashionable, thanks to Mr. Norman
Lindsay.</p>

<p>PEOPLE who previously objected to it are now viewing it
tolerantly. In Michigan, they aim to ban anything that tends to
make vice more attractive and virtue a back number. Films must have
no bedroom scenes, no bathroom scenes, no scanty clothing scenes,
no demonstrations of passionate love, and no scenes of blood-shed
or violence.</p>

<p>We look forward to the times when there will be no bathrooms, or
if there are, when they are hermetically sealed and are referred
to, when it is impossible to refrain from mentioning them, as the
"B."</p>

<p>Soap, in these happy times, on account of its close association
with the naked flesh, will be referred to as "S," and will be sold
in packets labelled "Dog Biscuits." When retiring to the "B.R."
(bedroom), the pure-minded man will not clothe himself scantily,
but rather don an over-coat, and, having locked the door, stand up
in the wardrobe and go to sleep.</p>

<p>Demonstrations of passionate love will be confined to
hand-shaking, and then only under proper supervision.</p>

<p>Violence and bloodshed will not be permitted except in surgeries
and dental parlors.</p>

<p>As for women&mdash;women will not be permitted at all.</p>

<p>Or perhaps they might be kept in compounds, wearing long
chaff-bag coverings and stove-pipe leggings.</p>

<p>Anything calculated to arouse the baser passions, such as a
knife and fork, will be used only of people of repute. Square
plates, of course. We can never look on a round plate without
blushing at its curves.</p>

<p>If any reader can think of any other improvements, we will be
glad to put them into effect, or ban them, or burn and prohibit and
disinfect them.</p>

<p>We get a sensual pleasure out of banning things, and pure minds
are full of things to ban.</p>

<h2>TRAIN TURTLES FOR PROFIT</h2>

<p>Wanted, supplies Live Tortoise, immed. deliv.</p>

<p>We have been doing a bit of wavering, but we have decided that
we cannot part with our 5000 tortoises.</p>

<p>We know each one of them by name. When we call they gallop up
and eat out of our hand. In the case of a dead-heat between two
tortoises, they eat out of both hands.</p>

<p>This to save bickering.</p>

<p>Then there were our turtles. They got in among the tortoises. We
had to make separate pens for the turtises and tortles which were
the unfortunate outcome.</p>

<p>We had a go at mating tortoises with hedge hogs, in order to
produce tortoise-shell brushes, but this was a failure.</p>

<p>We had a frightful lot of trouble. There were the tortoises that
turned turtle on us. As we said before, we knew the titles of our
total turtles. There is nothing more affectionate than a
turtle.</p>

<p>Their coats are so warm, and if you don't belt them in the face
they'll do you no harm, as the old nursery rhyme says.</p>

<p>We strongly advise readers to take up turtles or tortoises as a
hobby or profession.</p>

<p>Of course, it is difficult to take up a turtle as a tortoise,
but the shearing season is between July and September, and the
average torsle should yield about five dressing-table sets to the
season.</p>

<p>This is about all we care to divulge about tortisels. Further
information will be supplied on receipt of 10d. in stamps.</p>

<h2>CHANCES WE MISSED</h2>

<p>Any cheering to be done, who does it? We do. "The day of vapid
and inane advertising is ending. The modern advertiser who does not
appeal to the customer's intellect, is lost." Get that? Lost!
Blood-hounds and search parties indicated.</p>

<p>WE get a kick out of every modern advertisement we see. After
reading through an American magazine we are black and blue, and
after a short period, during which we are kept under observation,
are allowed to go home.</p>

<p>"What? A hundred and eighty years old to-day! My dear, you don't
look a day over 170. However do you do it?"</p>

<p>"It's that new Creme Clammy, cherie. I just put it on between
meals. And just fancy! It comes in 59 different varieties, to suit
any size face!"</p>

<p>"Oo, la, la! I must buy a keg of it immediately!"</p>

<p>Now, that's the stuff to give 'em.</p>

<p>Take the case of that chap Wilberforce.</p>

<p>Wealthy, and with plenty of money. Good-looking and of noble
birth, he had a luxurious steam yacht and a steam train and railway
station. Yet everyone avoided him.</p>

<p>When he walked into the theatre the whole audience made a dive
for the fire exits. He couldn't make it out. Even his best friends
wouldn't tell him.</p>

<p>Soon as they saw him coming they stepped on it and aimed for the
nearest horizon. But at last one of his enemies told him&mdash;by
telegram. You guessed it&mdash;he had halitosis. Ninety per cent.
of our divorce cases are due solely to this ravaging disease.</p>

<p>That makes you sit up, doesn't it?</p>

<p>Then there was that other fellow.</p>

<p>He thought: "Holy Mike! Another second of this and I'm
asphyxiated!" But, just to be polite, he said: "You stick there.
I'm going to throw myself under a tram."</p>

<p>That ought to be enough to make any self-respecting girl go and
wash herself all over with Lifer's Soap.</p>

<p>Take our own case. We received a letter saying, "Are you an
unemployed labourer? WHY NOT BECOME AN UNEMPLOYED ARCHITECT? We
could have been anything; electrical engineer, lift-driver,
deep-sea diver; all by signing the dotted line and sending no
money."</p>

<p>We became an architect in three weeks. Our wife, who read all
the instructions, became an architect, too. If young Wally had been
old enough to read he'd have been an architect.</p>

<p>We used to practise on each other. The wife would fall through
the front door and say: "I got that there raise, Mabel! That brings
me up to four hundred dollars per, an' nex' week they're going to
make me managing director!"</p>

<p>And I'd say: "And it's all due to the Inter-changeable
Correspondence School! Now we'll be able to get that red and yeller
blanket we've always wanted."</p>

<p>When we sit down and strap ourself into a chair and think of how
on earth we got on before there were any advertisements, when we
didn't have pyorrhoea or halitosis, or unsightly hairs, skin
blemishes, no ambition, couldn't play music on a saw, couldn't hold
board meetings spell-bound, and were never offered the opportunity
to earn 1000.00 dollars a week giving away packets of giant
beans...well, it makes us feel sorry for us, when we look back on
ourself.</p>

<h2>MEN MUST PAY HEAVILY TO BE BEAUTIFUL</h2>

<p>Doddering into the swellest barber's saloon in town, we fell
into a chair and said: "Make us look human."</p>

<p>"This is not a surgery," replied the barber kindly.</p>

<p>THEN we said, "Shave us, shampoo, face massage, violent-ray, and
de-blackhead us. We are in your hands."</p>

<p>So he started. Right here we want to say that if ever you want
the ravages of time and the effects of high living and low morals
eradicated from the countenance, or face, do what we did.</p>

<p>It will only cost you about 25/&mdash;if you get out alive.</p>

<p>The shave, with eleven hot towels and three varieties of face
cream. The hair-cut with the electric tooth-drill; the
shampoo&mdash;these are mere preliminaries.</p>

<p>The hair is dried with hot air, both electrical and human.</p>

<p>Then starts the face massage. You are oiled, creamed, and
bleared.</p>

<p>An electrical exasperator is wheeled up to your side. The
operator turns the thing on, and you immediately get heebie-jeebies
in the face.</p>

<p>You then disappear from human ken beneath a swathe of hot
towels. The operator then goes away, presumably to the races or to
have lunch.</p>

<p>After many years, during which your whole life passes before
you, the towels are taken away and pink mud is rubbed, slapped, and
pounded into your face.</p>

<p>Hydrochloric acid, or something more fierce, is poured on to
you. Cream, oil&mdash;a final belt in the cheek, and you are
massaged.</p>

<p>The violent-ray we took without anaesthetic. It consists of a
swarm of starving ants with important appointments in your cerebral
crannies.</p>

<p>Twice we nearly escaped, but we were brought back, giggling,
with our tonsorial robes bedraggled, but still furled tightly
around the neck.</p>

<p>We were given smelling salts, and a towel soaked in Florida
water to suck.</p>

<p>Then we were manicured. Let us draw a curtain over this. We were
thrown out of the manicure parlor. Nice girl, though.</p>

<p>And so back to the office, walking mincingly into the lift,
asking the draivah to draive slowleh so as not to disturb ouah
part.</p>

<p>Smelling strongly of Ashes of Chlorafluers, we found we were
most unwelcome. Our peaches and cream complexion was lost in our
hasty retreat from the sub-editor's room to the lift.</p>

<p>N.B.&mdash;The lift driver has since had the elevator
insectibaned.</p>

<h2>WHY IS A WHALE?</h2>

<p>Seeing that a whale blundered into Sydney Harbour to have a look
at our crowning bridge work (dentists! please note), we have made a
few inquiries about whales, last two whales having died on us on
a/c of over-feeding.</p>

<p>WHALES are of various sorts. Sperm whales, hump-backed whales,
blue whales, Prince of Wales, New South Wales...and it gathers
about like that. Whales have calves, but no feet. They are the only
fish who blow their noses. Their young swim in schools, but don't
learn anything. Whales are too big.</p>

<p>Ambergris comes from male whales, Verdigris from female whales,
Candlegris from candle-grease whales, which have not yet been
discovered, but anything is likely to happen.</p>

<p>No whale has been known to travel sideways. Whether this is due
to lack of initiative or pure nastiness has not yet been found
out.</p>

<p>Whales have no fins. This was a frequent source of annoyance to
Jonah, who made whales sick. If Jonah had been in a modern whale he
would have had a telephone laid on with hot and cold water service
and periscope.</p>

<p>Twin-screw whales with lifeboats and saloon accommodation are
extremely rare. Catching of whales is done with harpoons. A harpoon
is a small harp. The harpoon is barbed. A barboon is a small barb,
or baby baboon. The instrument is thrown at the whale and
penetrates the blubber.</p>

<p>The whale lubbers and wails. Hence present depression. Whales
make very unsuitable pets, as they are likely to go mad and kick
the face of the hand that fed them.</p>

<p>Whales sound frequently, but never shout. Don't like whales.</p>

<h2>WAGERS THAT ARE WORTH MAKING<br>
AN EASY WAY TO GET RID OF UNDESIRABLES.</h2>

<p>About this golfer who is going to play golf from Brisbane to
Adelaide, via Sydney and Melbourne&mdash;he is not allowed to touch
the ball with his hands or feet unless with special permission.</p>

<p>We suppose he will be allowed to bowl it along with his forehead
occasionally. It wouldn't do the ball any harm and might do the
golfer a lot of good.</p>

<p>We often wonder who lays all these wagers. We are going to be
one of them. We shall challenge our landlord to push a wheelbarrow
across Australia, hopping on one foot. And when he comes back and
puts his barrow wearily down outside the vacant house the next-door
neighbour will say: "Lower? He left here a week ago."</p>

<p>And we shall go to the Taxation Commissioner and say to him:
"Excuse me, but would you mind bowling a hoop around the world for
a bet?"</p>

<p>Then we would go along to Parliament House and say: "We bet you
aren't game to sit on a two hundred foot pole for about eleven
years."</p>

<p>And when we had got them all sitting on poles, and pushing
barrows, and walking from Sydney to Bechuanaland, and slipping on
banana-skins from Perth to Redfern, we would sit down, fold our
hands one within the other, and begin to enjoy life.</p>

<h2>PEDESTRIANS OF RUBBER<br>
AND OTHER USEFUL INVENTIONS.</h2>

<p>GOT something to tell you. In Germany, they've got rubber sign
standards and rubber milestones to make travel safer for
motorists.</p>

<p>According to the book, "these flexible posts, painted in bright
colours, bend to a horizontal position when struck by a car, and
spring back into shape without damage."</p>

<p>We have under way a suggestion for rubber pedestrians.</p>

<p>We were once a masseur on a rubber farm. Bearing 1000 tennis
balls to the acre, it was one of the most successful farms in the
business. The amount of business we did could be seen with the
naked eye in bad times. That's how big the thing was.</p>

<p>And what happened?</p>

<p>First of all, we messed up the rubber duck section for
surf-bathers. Lost our duck. The only model we had.</p>

<p>We miss its quack. But this is no time for remorse. America
killed us in the East by dumping elastic in China at cut rates.</p>

<p>Ruined our garter market.</p>

<p>Who first marketed the rubber summons? We did.</p>

<p>When delivered, it immediately springs back. Who invented that
story about the Boss? We stretch it and it flies back. Need you
ask?</p>

<p>You needn't. We'll see you in the Dom. Went to see our broker
and decided he's no broker. If there's going to be a "Dead Broke"
competition, we're on scratch. And about rubber...don't invest.
Your money is more settled in the Savings Bank.</p>

<p>You can't bounce a rubber tree and...wait a minute...don't jump
off the tram in your goloshes.</p>

<h2>PERSONALITYY CHARACTER, DETERMINATION</h2>

<p>You Must Say: "Nothing Less Than Two Thousand a Year Will
Do"</p>

<p>IT looked good to me, it stood out from the rest of the
"Positions Vacant." It struck your eye like a wart on your girl's
lip.</p>

<p>You didn't have to be experienced. You just had to have
personality, character, ambition, determination and a desire to
earn nothing less than two thousand pounds a year. It implored you
to join their sales organisation, and get on the permanent staff
and become a general manager in no time. It was absolutely an open
slather for the general-managership.</p>

<p>Well, I had all the character, personality, determination, and
ambition about the place, and they didn't mention anything about a
clean collar, so I went along.</p>

<p>I thought it was funny not seeing any of the boys around. There
are about seventy of us generally, all after the same job, and
after answering advertisements for a few months you get sort of
chummy. I remember one feller did get the job once. It fair broke
him up. At the send-off we gave him down at the Labor Bureau, he
cried like a child.</p>

<p>Anyhow, I'm standing there, feeling lonely like, and a bloke
buttons me, and I'm wafted into the office.</p>

<p>"Take a seat," he says.</p>

<p>I takes it.</p>

<p>Then he eyes me off. Looks at me as if he knew all my past life,
and had me stripped to the bone. He keeps it up for a while,
thinking I'll break down and confess; but I've been through it
before, and I refrains from crackin' him one.</p>

<p>"What name did you say, Mr.&mdash;er&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Spivells&mdash;James Spivells," I say.</p>

<p>"Oh! yes," he says, as if he knew it all the time, and was just
seeing if I could remember it.</p>

<p>"Have you had any experience as a sales-man?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Hm. Well, Mr. Squiggles, the proposition is this: We deal in
real estate, and we have a few vacancies for men with&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Character, personality, determination&mdash;" I starts off,
just to show him I know the chorus and ain't been wasting my
time.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," he chips in. "Well, we are opening up a new estate
practically a stone's-throw from Redfern, just this side of
Brewarrina, and we want men of your stamp to handle it."</p>

<p>I throws out the chest.</p>

<p>"Experience is unnecessary&mdash;we train you. It's the MAN we
want. Men with&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Charact&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes!" he says quickly. He strikes me as the sort of bloke
that butts in.</p>

<p>"There is no limit, Mr. Struggles, to the advancement possible
in this position!" he says, pounding the table, and glaring at me
with a deny-it-and-I'll-dong-you sort of expression.</p>

<p>I nods and looks intelligent.</p>

<p>"There's Smith," he says. "Came to us&mdash;just the same as
you&mdash;six months ago. It's a poor week he doesn't draw a
hundred pounds!"</p>

<p>I gasps.</p>

<p>"Jones&mdash;left us now&mdash;sorry to lose him&mdash;bought
his own yacht, and is now travelling round the world!"</p>

<p>"You don't say!" I says, popping at the eye-balls.</p>

<p>He simmers down a bit.</p>

<p>"You understand, Mr. Spriggles, that we don't pay a weekly
salary. Your commission is high. If you sell a block worth thirty
pounds, you receive twenty-five pounds commission. AND," he says,
wagging a finger that seems to be on a universal joint, "You'll
have no trouble in selling it. It sells itself! Any man, woman or
child can see the difference the North Shore bridge has made to
Brewarrina."</p>

<p>He leans forward.</p>

<p>"The suburbs are rapidly pushing
out&mdash;out&mdash;out&mdash;"</p>

<p>I looks round for the dog.</p>

<p>I'm feeling a bit fed up.</p>

<p>"Land values will rise to unheard of heights. A thirty pound
block will be worth thousands. Tell me, Mr. Skeggles, why didn't
you buy land at Darlinghurst in 1850?"</p>

<p>"Wasn't there," I says, quick with the alibi.</p>

<p>"You didn't have the foresight! You didn't have the foresight!",
he yells. "Now, we had two men out selling this estate yesterday.
They were doing splendidly&mdash;splendidly; and of course they
must go and get their feet crushed," he trailed off in a miserable
way.</p>

<p>"Feet crushed?" I says.</p>

<p>"Yes. The right foot. Both on the same side of the street, in
the same terrace. Practically in the same door!"</p>

<p>"Remarkable!"</p>

<p>"A coincidence, indeed, Mr. Spivells&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You've got it!" I yells. "Hold her at that!"</p>

<p>"What?" he says.</p>

<p>"Spivells," I says. "Spivells&mdash;try and remember it.
Spivells. Spivells, Spivells&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't dribble on the carpet!" he says, looking anxious.</p>

<p>I shuts up.</p>

<p>"Well, Mr.&mdash;er&mdash;Spivells, I've put the proposition to
you. Do you feel confident that you can sell this land?"</p>

<p>"I do!" I says, shivering slightly. It reminds me of a
wedding.</p>

<p>"Right," he says, and forks out a couple of forms.</p>

<p>"Just fill those forms in, Mr.&mdash;er&mdash;and we'll soon
have you fixed up."</p>

<p>I runs an eye over them.</p>

<p>Straight away I sees the cloven hoof:&mdash;</p>

<p>"And I agree to purchase land to the value of fifty pounds from
the Stars and Stripes Real Estate Coy. as an evidence of good faith
and to ensure my active interest..."</p>

<p>I clutches the other page.</p>

<p>It says:</p>

<p>Date. Height. Weight. Name at present. Past names. Parents'
names. Sentences (if any). Where were you born? When? Why? Was your
mother a white woman? Do you wear underwear? (State whether wool or
cotton.) When did you leave your last employer. Why? How? (State
whether tram or 'bus.) Did he miss you?</p>

<p>There's a whole page of it. I stands up and looks at him.</p>

<p>"I'll think it over," I says.</p>

<p>"The opportunity may be gone," he says.</p>

<p>"Don't stop it on my account," I says.</p>

<p>"Very well," says he, as I hoofed it to the door.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry for you. You'll never succeed, Mr. Squirrels.
Good-bye...Next, please!"</p>

<p>I chews over the "Squirrels" for a while, then I gets into the
lift and goes.</p>

<p>A man has enough trouble, without being pinched for a salt.</p>

<h2>LOVE AND KISSES</h2>

<p>Love!</p>

<p>What scenes are called up by the mere mouthing of the word! What
scenes! What hellishing rows! A film which involves a fair amount
of kissing has recently been banned by the Chief Commonwealth
Censor. Not that that matters. He hasn't been properly kissed.</p>

<p>We have been kissed, ourself.</p>

<p>In our adolescent stages we were once so kissed that we ran
around in circles for some days, and for weeks after that we walked
about in a trance.</p>

<p>There was one...older 'n us, she was&mdash;she said, "Kizz
muh!"</p>

<p>Got a half-nelson on us, she did, and they had to bring us
brandy and undo our collar and use artificial respiration. Never
been quite the same since. She was one of these tall, sinuous women
who never seem to have any money.</p>

<p>Then there was a brunette. She was one who used to gradually
look closer and closer into your eyes, until the back of your head
hit the wall. Waggle her eyelashes on your neck and start the real
business from the back of your ear and work round to the front of
your face, by which time you had swooned away.</p>

<p>One way and another, we missed a lot of fun, swooning away.</p>

<p>Maisie&mdash;she was a nice girl. We should have smashed her
teeth in about four times a week. She said she could only treat us
as a sister would a brother. Used to kiss us on the forehead!</p>

<p>Asked her, in desperation, how long this sister business would
be going on. She said, "For ever!" and burst into tears.</p>

<p>So we told her that we had a sister, and strode off into the
night.</p>

<p>We have been kissed by distant female relatives. We have even
been kissed by our wife.</p>

<p>She says, "Whisky!"</p>

<p>"No! No! Dear!" we say, virtuously.</p>

<p>"Kiss me again"...</p>

<p>"Brandy."</p>

<p>We blush.</p>

<p>"You've had four brandies!"</p>

<p>We give in and confess to the four. What else can you do when
you know that you've had twelve brandies?</p>

<p>Love, these days, gives us a pain in the small of the back. If
anyone wants to censor kissing, we are on his side.</p>

<p>The Maoris rub noses instead of kissing, and our idea of
Paradise is a place full of nose-less Maoris.</p>

<p>We are, of course, open to conversion....</p>

<h2>LONELY SARDINE<br>
ELECTROCARDIOGRAM!</h2>

<p>Phantasmagoria!</p>

<p>Not that we bear any malice. Simply that we occasionally run
short of curses. As Edison once said to the Governor of South
Carolina, "Inspiration is one-tenth perspiration and nine-tenths
exasperation."</p>

<p>We shall, therefore, talk to you to-day, children, about
sardines.</p>

<p>The sardine lives in a tin slum and, due to its environment,
there are many feeble-minded sardines in our
midst&mdash;unaccustomed, mark you, as they are to public
speaking.</p>

<p>Environment, said he, throwing his cigarette-butt into the waste
paper basket in an earnest attempt to burn the office down, is a
strange thing. In a very short time, a cat caught in a rat trap
becomes distinctly like a dead rat. Given time, the cat may even
become deader than the rat. As the poet described the electric
chair, "That burn from which no traveller returns"&mdash;that's
where it goes.</p>

<p>Speaking of electric chairs, we understand that they are most
uncomfortable. A man told us that the accommodation in the electric
chair department was shocking. Apart from that, he explained to us
that it was one of the few occasions when he didn't have to
strap-hang.</p>

<p>They had five goes at him and he blew the fuses out every
time.</p>

<p>At the finish, he was so full of electricity that if he pressed
his vest button a bell would ring.</p>

<p>Which naturally brings us to the subject of Christmas puddings,
of which there are two kinds: the one you put the cheques in and
boil it&mdash; and ours. For a large family, we recommend our
recipe. All you need is a pound of raisins and a bag of cement.
This will last a family of eight for about twelve (12) Christmases.
This pudding is hard to beat.</p>

<p>Raisins are very good for you. They contain a lot of iron.</p>

<p>Talk of iron! We knew a man who had so much iron that he was
full of nuts and bolts. Matter of fact, he lived on nuts and bolted
his meals. After he was operated on for appendicitis he had to be
riveted.</p>

<p>If he wanted to turn around, he had to use a spanner. Threw
himself under a train and wrecked the train. Rusted away after a
long and peaceful life, and was pronounced dead by one of the best
engineers in the country.</p>

<p>And if you must have something about sardines, they have no
heads, but they carry tales.</p>

<p>Mean to say, they repeat on us.</p>

<p>Abysinnia later.</p>

<h2>"WE MELT IN TEARS"</h2>

<p>Professor Haydon, of Denver, U.S.A., deplores the "hackneyed
phrases of the cheap British novelists."</p>

<p>WE do not agree. Look at the exercise YOU get.</p>

<p>For instance. "At last he caught her eye!" (She had been
"casting her eye about the room" a few minutes before this, and she
was also doing a bit of "shimmering in her voluptuous evening
gown.")</p>

<p>He "paled and trembled visibly" (try it yourself); then, "with
an effort he regained his composure, and, turning on his heel,
darted from the room". (We have tried darting from the room, but
our aim is rotten. We are four door-knobs behind.)</p>

<p>"For a moment she stood rigid (stiffness set in), and then swept
out of the room" (what she swept out of the room is never
divulged.)</p>

<p>"His face fell." (This is a bit awkward&mdash;especially on a
tiled floor.) "But he straightened himself up and thrust his chin
out."</p>

<p>Upstairs, "Lady Grasmere flung herself on her bed"&mdash;"or
threw herself on the floor" (optional), and her "body shook with
sobs. Her brain whirled. A lump came into her throat...her heart
was broken."</p>

<p>That's what you get for throwing yourself at a bed. Always
better to aim for the bed, and, even if you hit the floor, it makes
no difference to the story.</p>

<p>An' what's Lord Eustonberry doing down-stairs?</p>

<p>"Snarling, he spat a few words at the Colonel" (enough to start
a fight anywhere), "and then flung himself through the door of the
billiard room, his eyes emitting sparks."</p>

<p>That&mdash;even that little bit&mdash;is what we call a hard
day's work.</p>

<p>Forsooth, who is this professor to play Canute to the sea of
words? Let him "shrink into himself, livid with fear." We also have
our dislikes.</p>

<h2>THE OYSTER AT HOME</h2>

<p>Sat in the dark yesterday afternoon with a lot of oyster
farmers. The lantern-slide lecture was great. All about sperms and
bi-valves and things. Highly instructive it was.</p>

<p>For instance, we learnt that an oyster in its early stages swims
about. We have never had to swim after an escaping oyster yet, but
it must be tiring.</p>

<p>An oyster has one foot. This one-footedness is natural, and the
oyster receives no pension so far as we could gather. On its foot
it oists itself along. Hence the term "oyster."</p>

<p>We made inquiries, but were unable to ascertain whether the
noise on oyster leases was due to the oysters stamping their
feet.</p>

<p>After a while, it loses it footing, so to speak, and is on the
rocks permanently. This is sad but we've all been through it.</p>

<p>Probably this accounts for the wrinkles on the oyster.</p>

<p>This year the Combined Oyster Farmers' Association will give a
cup for best two and three-year-old oysters.</p>

<p>We have never seen a combined oyster. Probably it means married
oysters, but we have had one two-year-old in training for the last
four months, and with any luck and a firm track, we hope to carry
off the weight-for-age event.</p>

<p>We would advise the public to be on our oyster.</p>

<p>The lecturer said that "any man who eats a bad oyster deserves
ptomaine poisoning."</p>

<p>He also said that the idea of not eating oysters in months with
an R in them was all wrong.</p>

<p>But, after seeing the internal works of an oyster magnified
umpteen times, we have decided that the months in which one should
not eat oysters are: January, February, March, April, Mray, Jrune,
Jruly, Aurgurst, Septeremberr, Octoroberr, Noveroverember, and
Drecerember.</p>

<p>This is as much as we care to know about oysters.</p>

<h2>ABOUT FROGS</h2>

<p>A Brisbane frog arrived at Mascot on the tail-plane of the
Brisbane mail plane yesterday morning.</p>

<p>This is probably the longest hop ever taken by a frog.</p>

<p>The frog is a strange animal which lives in creeks and
croaks.</p>

<p>It also lives on water and hops.</p>

<p>One frog is spawn every minute. The stages of the frog are
interesting to be interested in.</p>

<p>First the spawn. Then the rod, tad-pole, or perch. Then the frog
on its log in the bog. (Poetry.)</p>

<p>We have the bull-frog. The cow-frog and the calf-frog were last
seen at the battle of Blenheim (1345, A.D.)</p>

<p>The tadpole is an apprentice frog. Tadpoles born in May are
Maypoles.</p>

<p>The barberspole is a frog which comes out in red, white, and
blue stripes when fully matured. It costs 6d. in most places, or
9d. with a hot towel.</p>

<p>In France, people eat frogs&mdash;fifty million Frenchmen can't
be wrong.</p>

<p>Eat more frogs. Of course, in the case of there being a death in
France since time of writing, there is a possibility of forty-nine
million nine hundred and ninety-nine thousand nine hundred and
ninety-nine Frenchmen being misled.</p>

<p>But let it be here stated that the frog which arrived on the
Brisbane mail plane was a bull frog, because it was a mail
frog.</p>

<p>And if it wasn't a bull frog that rode on the mail plane, it
must have been toad.</p>

<h2>A LOWER STANDARD</h2>

<p>One of the brightest spots in our hitherto drab life is the
abolition of the gold standard in favour of a note standard.</p>

<p>The British Government is merely following a procedure which we
have advocated and put into practice for many months past.</p>

<p>Some of our notes have been classics.</p>

<p>DEAR SIR,&mdash;Owing to the present financial depression, we
find ourself unable to meet your just demands immediately. However,
we are expecting shortly a legacy from a wealthy relative in Fiji,
and you may rest assured...</p>

<p>Then there was the other one which always worked. You simply pin
the note on your door: "BACK IN TEN MINUTES." You then go away for
eleven years, and are never heard of again.</p>

<p>GAS CO.</p>

<p>Sirs,&mdash;Your insulting message reached me this morning. Need
I say that I was disgusted and annoyed? This is the fourth final
notice I have had from you. Any more of this, and I shall be
compelled to request you to send a man to cut off my gas
supply.</p>

<p>This usually fixes things. Of course, there are faults in the
system.</p>

<p>Yesterday we were presented with a note, "I.O.U. 5/-. Signed, L.
W. Lower." So we went back to the gold standard.</p>

<p>The whole thing is very involved. Mean to say, come home and
find on kitchen table a note, "Waited up till 2 o'clock. Where have
you been? Your dinner is in the oven."</p>

<p>That sort of note is NOT negotiable.</p>

<h2>TALKING OF WORMS</h2>

<p>A man, whose name we will not mention, on account of the vile
crime which he did and which we do not wish to be slung up in front
of his countless ancestors, yet unborn, and the whole neighbourhood
taking a day off to go and point the finger of scorn, the sturdier
members getting out their shovels and heaping ignomy on
him&mdash;he was fined 2 pounds with 8 shillings costs at
Court.</p>

<p>He was caught red-handed, digging worms at San Souci, thus
annoying the oyster-leasers, and was charged with having
"unlawfully taken worms" and with "unlawfully having caught worms
on a closed area."</p>

<p>And to think that that man was once an innocent little babe,
lounging at his mother's knee!</p>

<p>As for us, we can say with a certain amount of pride that we
have never taken worms. We have taken everything else, from pills
to mustard baths and aspirins, but so far we haven't shown any
serious and determined hankering for worms.</p>

<p>But, of course, we know a good deal about them. There are two
kinds of worms. Long worms and short worms.</p>

<p>The long worms can be easily distinguished from the short worms;
the head of the short worm being invariably closer to the tail than
in the case of the long worm.</p>

<p>It has long puzzled scientists how the worm finds a hole to fit
it.</p>

<p>Nature in its awful wisdom has provided holes of various sizes
all over our vast and glorious continent. All the worm has to do is
to tramp about and find a hole that fits.</p>

<p>We knew of one worm with goitre that walked from Coogee to
Parramatta before it found a suitable home. Even then it was only a
semi-detached hole, being next to a quarry.</p>

<p>The grub is very close to the worm and could quite easily be
taken for a worm by anyone who has never seen a worm. The only
difference between the two is that the one has more legs, and more
hair on its chest than the other. The grub is also better
upholstered.</p>

<p>Aborigines regard grubs as a delicacy and will chase them for
miles, hurling boomerangs at them.</p>

<p>Other kinds are found underneath logs&mdash;although how the
devil those little chaps balance those great logs has got us
beat.</p>

<p>We cannot speak with any authority on the subject, but we
presume that the grub lies on its back and then pulls the log over
itself.</p>

<p>The centipede is really an armor-plated worm, equipped with a
knife and fork at one end. It has a lot of legs, an incalculable
number, and how it keeps in step?...We won't bother about it. Once
you start thinking about things like that, you go mad and run
around in circles barking like a dog.</p>

<h2>VISIT TO THE ZOO</h2>

<p>This is a mutiny. We were supposed to go to the Zoo to-day, but
we have been there before, and our motto is: Anything once; the
second time, it's worse.</p>

<p>FURTHERMORE, a visit to Taronga Park leaves us feebly seething
with sad rage. We fail to see how a lion is any worse off than we
are.</p>

<p>They have nothing to do but be looked at; they are fed and
housed, and the leopard even carries a spot on the hip.</p>

<p>Who knocks on the tortoise's door, demanding the rent?</p>

<p>The pelican has the biggest bill in the place, but does it worry
him?</p>

<p>The camel was born with the hump, and the dromodaries have two
of them. But dromodaries and camels are born, not made. Therein
lies the advantage.</p>

<p>Consider the zebra. Sergeants of the militia with three stripes
gaze upon him curiously. The zebra, with 43 stripes, gazes back
contemptuously.</p>

<p>The ducks swim about, immune from Christmas. The giraffe looks
down upon us.</p>

<p>Given an almost cut-glass salad bowl, we must make a speech
about it. Given an unwanted peanut, the orang-outang may throw it
back at you and then nonchalantly scratch the back of his neck.</p>

<p>Monkeys, being almost human, delight to make fools of themselves
before an audience. But who ever heard of an unemployed monkey?</p>

<p>Fish in the aquarium are as safe from hooks as a monk is safe
from matrimony.</p>

<p>A bear that sits up and begs for a bun and is hit on the snout
with a peanut is no worse off than the husband who comes home and
says, "Hullo, darling!" and is answered with "Humph!"</p>

<p>It has been said that man descended from monkeys, but
considering the fun monkeys have, it is apparent to the clothed and
taxed onlooker that we have descended too far.</p>

<p>We refuse to be humiliated at the Zoo.</p>

<h2>HOW TO DISCOVER A GOLD MINE</h2>

<p>The gold quest is still on. Countless unemployed are now working
like mad, though still practically unemployed. We ask you,
citizens, what do you know about gold? Echo answers, "Ask me?"</p>

<p>What do you know about quartz?</p>

<p>Quartz is what you get milk in.</p>

<p>What is a quartette? It is a pint and a half.</p>

<p>Gold is found in veins and seams.</p>

<p>How vein it seems?</p>

<p>The unsuccessful prospector spends all his life tapping rocks.
The successful prospector spends about three weeks rocking taps.
After which he sets off for the desert once more.</p>

<p>Alluvial gold is usually dished from the start. From the cradle
to the grave, so to speak. More trips are made from the cradle to
the grave than from the cradle to the "Australia."</p>

<p>Which reminds us of minny golf courses. There are too minny golf
courses.</p>

<p>Which also reminds us that very few golfing prospectors tell the
hole truth.</p>

<p>Mines! Mines! What do we know about mines? Mine's a beer!</p>

<p>My heavens, amigo (Spanish) if you had to fill up a certain
amount of space like this, you would also do as we do.</p>

<p>We are stonkered for ideas. There comes a tide in the affairs of
men when they rush to cover. When they go into nursing homes. When
they discover that they have important business about 300 miles
away. When they say, "You know damn well I don't like baked
rabbit!" and such harsh words.</p>

<p>One touch of Nature makes the whole world kin. Two touches, and
you've got it suspicious.</p>

<p>Let us then away.</p>

<h2>UNDERSTAND?</h2>

<p>A paper, referring to the University carillon: "Although small
in comparison with a larger bell, it is itself large compared with
some of the small ones."</p>

<p>Now, you quite understand, you news readers? You're sure that
you compree the lot? The smaller ones are smaller than those that
are larger, And larger than those that are, not.</p>

<p>And you see that the big ones are large ones, And the high ones
e'xceedingly tall, Not nearly so large as those that are larger.
But bigger than those that are small.</p>

<p>So, really, the large ones are small ones. No! The small ones
are small-still big, though Compared to the small ones, but smaller
Compared to the big-damned if I know!</p>

<p>Work it out for yourself,</p>

<h2>ABOUT FIRES</h2>

<p>Speaking from the fire escape, in our asbestos underpants. I
have just escaped from the prevention of a fire, at imminent risk
to the fire.</p>

<p>Goaded on by a magistrate who complained of the number of fires
in his diocese, and hinted, by saying out loud, that it was due to
incendiarism (you heard me!), we sat up all night thinking of a way
to start a preventible fire.</p>

<p>If the wife says to me, "You light the fire"&mdash;well, that's
a preventible fire. It only has an outside chance of starting, and
even then it will go out. It's a habit. I hurl the wood at a
certain spot, throw a match in the general direction of the wood.
Match goes out. I go out. In order to have any hope of preventing a
fire there must be some possibility of a fire starting
(Euclid).</p>

<p>Best way to prevent a fire is to fill a central room with
shavings, pour methylated spirits all over it, and then inform the
police.</p>

<p>A lot of unemployment has been caused in fire brigades by the
premature prevention of fires. It is a sad commentary...It is
indeed...anyhow, it's a bit tough.</p>

<p>I myself in person once knew a fireman who filled in his spare
time (of which he had a number) polishing his helmet. He wore it
down to a beret. He was saved being dismissed from the brigade by a
fortunate accident. While in a passionate rage, he stamped his foot
on the ground. He was wearing rubber boots.</p>

<p>The rest must be imagined to be believed. His knee hit his chin;
he fell back to the ground with a dull tinkle; cracked the skull.
He was a tall fireman. They buried him with his hose. In case he
needed it. He was buried on a ladder with full honors. In between
the time he knocked himself out and when he struck the ground, his
depositions were taken by an aged reporter. He was a VERY tall
fireman.</p>

<p>"It is my opinion," said the fireman, in passing, "that the
present heavy blue serge uniform is not the correct thing in which
a gentleman should attend a fire. White drill with tropical helmets
should&mdash;"</p>

<p>It was about this time that he crashed to the ground. Proving
that any tall person likely to fall over should always carry a
parachute.</p>

<p>But, about fires. Perhaps a little personal experience? A little
private pathos?</p>

<p>The dirty cow&mdash;HIM&mdash;(the Boss) said, "You're
fired!"</p>

<p>Rushed about the place seeking to be put out. Nobody game
enough. I was too well lit up. Rang fire brigade. Down the stairs
and flinging the body into the horse-trough. Dramatic arrival of
fire brigade.</p>

<p>Drenched victim pointing to Boss, crying, "He fired me!" Hose on
the Boss. Boss drowned.</p>

<p>Good time was had by all.</p>

<p>What is home without a fire. Every considerate married man
should have a fireman in his home.</p>

<h2>THE TERRORS OF WEALTH</h2>

<p>Half a million germs lurk on a pound note.</p>

<p>This has been discovered by a scientist. Probably he borrowed
the pound. This means 250,000 germs stroll about a
ten-shilling-note, and 125,000 germs are waiting to pounce from
five shillings&mdash;25,000 germs on a shilling! Heavens, do you
realise what peril you live in?</p>

<p>Could any man with a spark of humanity in his soul lend a man
two bob, knowing that it carried with it 50,000 germs, mostly
unclassified.</p>

<p>Every citizen in this country who is in possession of a
pound-note is a menace.</p>

<p>The Government has done its best. It has taxed us 25,000 germs
in every half million. It has taxed us countless germs annually.
But is it enough?</p>

<p>NO! (Applause.)</p>

<p>It has come to our notice that a well-known identity has been
walking about our city, defying our Government and laughing in the
faces of the police, carrying a pound-note in his left-hand
pocket.</p>

<p>This man is a carrier.</p>

<p>Hold him!</p>

<p>Stop him!</p>

<p>Recall the Governor!</p>

<p>Do something. Hooray!</p>

<h2>WHAT GOLD IS<br>
HOW TO GET IT AND WHERE IT IS</h2>

<p>It's not a bit of use looking for gold if you don't know where
it is.</p>

<p>People are pegging out claims all over the place when they would
be better employed pegging out the washing.</p>

<p>Gold is a metallic auriferous gold metal which is found in large
or small single lumps, or linked together as is in gold
watch-chains, or invisible, such as sovereigns.</p>

<p>Amateur prospectors must remember, however, that it is illegal
to peg out a claim on a man's stomach just because he has a gold
watch-chain.</p>

<p>Alluvial gold is found in creek-beds, water-holes, drain-pipes,
and various other places. It is found on mountains and in valleys,
etcetera.</p>

<p>It is also not found in many of the above places. That is the
catch.</p>

<p>The best way to tell gold is to pass the nugget around a crowded
bar, and ask them if it's gold.</p>

<p>If it comes back, it's not gold.</p>

<h2>MAKING MONEY OUT OF DOGS</h2>

<p>"I've been readin' the paper, Bill, and I've got an idea."</p>

<p>"You don't say! Well, them newspapers must be improvin' outer
sight. 'Ang out the flag&mdash;little Jimmy's got an idear."
"Listen to me. Work is as scarce in Sydney as the butter in a
hot-dog."</p>

<p>"Too right, James. Too blooming true."</p>

<p>"Don't interrupt me, you igerant cow, or I'll take my singlet
off you! As I was sayin' about this idea&mdash;you know the 'Lost
and Found' column?"</p>

<p>"Yeah."</p>

<p>"Well, look at the hundreds of things that are lost every day
and found by people who ain't lookin' for 'em. And the rewards!
There's money just for the picking up!"</p>

<p>"Yes! I know&mdash;'Lost, small leather bag, containing slate
and pencil, between Manly and Petersham. Finder keep slate, return
bag'&mdash;and rolls of notes. Now, I ask you, Jimmie, did you ever
'ear of anyone finding a roll of notes? No! of course you didn't.
It's a damn lie!"</p>

<p>"There's jewellery," suggested Jimmy.</p>

<p>"Huh! 'Angin' round waitin' for someone to drop their diamond
tiara outer the tram."</p>

<p>"Well, what about lost cats and dogs?"</p>

<p>"Look 'ere! If you think I'm goin' to spend me time crawlin'
over roofs collecting cats, in the 'opes that one of 'ems
lost&mdash;you're mistaken. My ruddy oath, you are!"</p>

<p>"Dogs," remarked Jimmie. "Now here's one: 'Lost, white
porneranium, black ears, answers to name of "Oozles." You'd sight
that dog out of a million. A white pom. with black ears!"</p>

<p>Bill walked to the window and draped himself over the sill.</p>

<p>"A fine chance," he remarked to the street, "a man's got
'Oozlin' every dog 'e sees with&mdash;Hoi! Blime!"</p>

<p>With a rush that knocked his friend off the chair, Bill had left
the window, and was now clattering down the stairs to the front
door.</p>

<p>Jimmy picked himself up, and gazed out the window.</p>

<p>"Struth!" he yelled, and dived for the door.</p>

<p>Outside, a white pomeranium with black ears sniffed disgustedly
at a banana skin in the gutter.</p>

<p>"'Ead 'im orf!" gasped Bill.</p>

<p>Jimmy spat disgustedly over his shoulder: "Nobody mistook me for
Nurmi before," he panted. "'Ead 'im orf yourself."</p>

<p>The dog, not having the incentive of an urgent need of cash,
gave in, and Bill, first on the scene, gathered him up.</p>

<p>"That your dog?"</p>

<p>"Eh?" said Bill, turning to the constable who had apparently
manifested himself from a hole in the road.</p>

<p>"Course he's my dorg! I wouldn't be bustin' meself chasin'
someone else's dorg. S'matter of fact, me and my mate (pointing to
Jimmy, who had just lumbered up) were trainin' 'im. I tell
y'constable (he dropped his voice to a whisper), first time we
gives 'im a run at the tin 'are&mdash;be on 'im."</p>

<p>He moved off.</p>

<p>"Walk quick, you mug," said Jimmy fearfully. "They don't race
pomeraniums after hares! You nearly cruelled it."</p>

<p>It was a long walk back.</p>

<p>"Well," said Bill, in the safety of their lodgings, "there 'e
is."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Jimmy, gazing down at the dog.</p>

<p>"Poor liddle Oozles. Here, Oozles, Oozles!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Blime! Oozles!" said Bill, "what a name to give the poor
little cow. No wonder 'es got black ears. 'Ere, Stinker!"</p>

<p>The dog wearily wagged his bushy tail.</p>

<p>"There, y'are!" said Bill, triumphantly. "'E knows a proper
dorg's name when 'e 'ears it."</p>

<p>Jimmy was studying the paper again.</p>

<p>"He belongs to 'Dilhurst,' Darlinghurst Road. We'll give him
that frankfurt you was keeping for your tea, and then I'll take him
along."</p>

<p>"Orright," said Bill, "I'll starve."</p>

<p>Man and dog were gone an hour, when Bill, from his eyrie in the
window, sighted them coming back.</p>

<p>"Aw, strike me pink!" he muttered, withdrawing himself from the
window, "I knew 'e'd muck it up."</p>

<p>He sat on the bed, turning over in his mind a few pithy remarks
to be delivered to James.</p>

<p>The doot opened.</p>

<p>"`Ullo, brains! What the 'ell did you bring the dorg back for?
No wonder you can't get a job. You got about as much gumption as a
politician&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Shut up, Sunshine! Gaze on this an' apologise."</p>

<p>Two pound notes were waving before his eyes. His mouth
opened.</p>

<p>"Now shut up!" said Jimmy. "I'll do all the talkin', same as I
do all the thinkin'."</p>

<p>He seated himself on the bed, and commenced.</p>

<p>"I goes up to the house, a big flash joint it is, knocks at the
door, and a tony old tart comes as soon as she hears I've got the
dog. 'My little Oozlums,' she says. 'Diddums get losty wosty?' Fair
make you vomit.</p>

<p>"She asks me a lot of questions, and I tells her 'ow I threw
meself in front of a 'bus just in time to save him, and she comes
to light with a quid.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm going out the gate, and there's a bloke waiting for
me.</p>

<p>"'Did you bring that damn dog back?' he says, real fierce.</p>

<p>"'Yes,' I says, 'an' I had a hard job to fetch him.'</p>

<p>"'Lord!' he says, 'and I had a hell of a job losing him.'</p>

<p>"He does his block.</p>

<p>"'I don't want the rotten thing in the house,' he yaps. 'How
much did my wife give you?'</p>

<p>"I tells him a quid.</p>

<p>"'Well, look here,' he says, 'here's another quid. You hang
about, and I'll push him out the door when she's not looking, and
you lose him! See! Lose him!'"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Bill. "Go on."</p>

<p>"Well, I waits, and sure enough, out comes Oozles&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stinker," amended Bill.</p>

<p>"And I pounces on him, and here we are."</p>

<p>With a flourish, Jimmy pocketed a pound and handed Bill the
other.</p>

<p>"Well, what'll we do with the dorg?" said Bill.</p>

<p>"I got another idea," said James. "I'm goin' out now to buy him
a chop and drink your health, William."</p>

<p>"I can't let you do everythink without 'elping you sometimes,"
said Bill. "I'll go with you."</p>

<p>Next morning, an excited Bill was reading to his mate: "Lorst, a
valuable white pomer&mdash;what's-its-name, with black ears.
Strayed from 'Dilhurst,' Darlinghurst Road. Answers to name of
Oozles. Reward 3 pounds. Detainer persecuted."</p>

<p>Jimmy smiled indulgently at his friend.</p>

<p>"That was my other idea," he said calmly. "That's why I brought
him back. It's your turn to find him now."</p>

<p>Bill gazed at him.</p>

<p>"Well, I won't say you're brainy; but for low cunning you'd beat
a Maltese pawnbroker, Jimmy. I'm erstounded at you. I'll take
Stinker up this afternoon."</p>

<p>"And after that we'll have to find another dog," said Jimmy.
"This one'll be played out."</p>

<p>"You know, James, we could make a business of this dorg-findin'.
'Lorst dorgs recovered&mdash;findings executed with utmost
dispatch'&mdash;an' all that. Work it up into a big business, an'
sell out."</p>

<p>"I'll think it over," said Jimmy loftily. Late that afternoon,
Bill stood at the door of "Dilhurht."</p>

<p>"Yairs," Bill was saying, "the young 'ooligans had 'im tied on
the tram line, an' I was just in time to stop the tram."</p>

<p>"Did you give them in charge?" asked the lady indignantly.</p>

<p>"Every bloomin' one of 'em, missus. Eleven there was&mdash;an' I
'ope for Stink&mdash;for Oozle's sake, they get six months
each."</p>

<p>"Henry," she said, turning to a man who had appeared in the
hallway, "this man has just brought my little Oozles back."</p>

<p>"Oh! Has he?"</p>

<p>He came to the door.</p>

<p>"Just wait a moment, and I'll bring you your reward," said the
lady to Bill, and disappeared.</p>

<p>"Where did you find that rotten pampered mongrel?" whispered the
man. "You ought to have more sense than to bring the thing back
here."</p>

<p>"But you lorst it!" said Bill, agape.</p>

<p>"Take it away! You curse&mdash;yes, and I am very pleased indeed
to see that there are still men kind enough to take care of a
defenceless doggie-woggie."</p>

<p>"Give this to the man, and thank him nicely, Henry," said the
lady from behind his back.</p>

<p>Three pounds changed hands, and disapappeared into Bill's
pocket.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll be goin'," said Bill.</p>

<p>"Stop!" hissed the man, gazing after his wife's retreating
form.</p>

<p>"Here!"&mdash;A fiver!</p>

<p>"Here!"&mdash;the dog!</p>

<p>Bill took both.</p>

<p>"Take it to b&mdash;!"</p>

<p>"Bankstown?" suggested Bill.</p>

<p>"Bourke!" blurted the man. "Get!"</p>

<p>Bill got.</p>

<p>Contentedly Oozles trotted alongside him back to the lodging
house.</p>

<p>Jim was there.</p>

<p>"Mug! Mug! Oh what a large, empty blooming mug! What did you
bring him back for?"</p>

<p>"Gaze on this bunch," said Bill, flourishing the notes, "an' go
down on yore bended knees an' weep tears of blood!"</p>

<p>"Willie," said James earnestly, "if that dog is seen with us,
we'll get years in the cooler."</p>

<p>"Why?" said Bill, in amazement.</p>

<p>"You know that cop what saw us pick him up? Well, I seen him
to-day and he buttons me. That old tart must have notified all the
police stations about that dog. He's worth pounds and pounds! I
didn't know how to get out of it, and I finishes up telling him the
truth about us wanting to get the reward, and how we took him back,
and it ain't our fault if he's lost again. We're alright now,
because he was a decent John; but if we're seen with that dog
again&mdash;we'll finish up eatin' with a wooden spoon!"</p>

<p>"Gaw!" exclaimed Bill.</p>

<p>"Did the bloke tell you to him away?"</p>

<p>"Yeah. To Bankstown."</p>

<p>"That's the ticket! You take him to Bankstown, and leave him. Go
now&mdash; better wrap him up in a parcel so no one'll see
him."</p>

<p>The wrapping of a live dog in a newspaper is no easy job, nor is
it any easier keeping him in the parcel whilst going past
policemen. Bill drew a huge sigh of relief as the train bore him
back from Bankstown&mdash;dogless&mdash;and the two men spent a
happy evening over several bottles and a bed-full of fish and
chips.</p>

<p>It was therefore with feelings of intense horror that Bill
viewed the spectacle of a dilapidated pomeranian dog wagging his
tail on the mat next morning.</p>

<p>He called Jim, and pointed.</p>

<p>They looked at each other, and a telepathic vision of prison
cells communicated itself to their minds.</p>

<p>"Wrap 'im again," said Bill tersely. "It's your turn to lose 'im
this time."</p>

<p>In silence they wrapped him. Jim took him away, and some
considerable time elapsed before he returned.</p>

<p>"Took him to Manly," he said, throwing his hat on the bed.</p>

<p>"Put yer 'at on again," said Bill.</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"We're movin'."</p>

<p>"Why? What did she say?"</p>

<p>"'Oo?"</p>

<p>"The landlady."</p>

<p>"Nothink. She don't know we're going'."</p>

<p>"Well, what&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Do y'think," said Bill, getting annoyed, "we want to be 'ere
when that damn dorg comes back?"</p>

<p>"Strike me! No. Got all my things?"</p>

<p>"I got your singlet an' the shavin' soap."</p>

<p>"That's right, come on. Walk soft."</p>

<h2>AMBITION AND SUCCESS.</h2>

<p>Many and various are the roads to success, and not all of them
are up-hill, though the roads down which one can toboggan are hard
to find, and for the most part private.</p>

<p>The methods of the successful differ.</p>

<p>There is the romantic method.</p>

<p>The humble workman marries the boss's daughter, after which the
boss falls into the machinery, and the hero is set for life.</p>

<p>Then there is the man who rises to the occasion. This generally
happens when the mine is caving in, and all the workmen except one
flee for their lives. The one left holds the mine up with his back
until assistance comes, and then collapses into the arms of the
mine-owner, with the words, "I have done my best." The mine-owner
may reply that he has seen it done better, but usually the man is
promoted.</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>By far the best-advertised method, and one highly recommended by
numerous moral journals, is the "humble striver."</p>

<p>The idea of this method is that no matter how lowly your job,
humbly strive to be a past-master at it.</p>

<p>Which recalls the story of the gutter-sweeper in a far country,
who decided to be the best gutter-sweeper in the world. For years
he swept as no other man could sweep, until, one day, the Grand
Hokum, going through the streets, passed the remark: "My word, that
gutter is clean! Who cleaned it?"</p>

<p>And the Deputy-Commissioner for Gutters replied: "Sire, I
believe it was the slave, Bill Smith."</p>

<p>And the Grand Hokum said: "Has he a cat?"</p>

<p>And the Chief Broom Stacker answered&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yea, sire, a beaut!"</p>

<p>"Then make him Lord Mayor!" said the Grand Hokum, and passed
on.</p>

<p>You see how the good and faithful worker is rewarded!</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>Then again, there was the nut-screwer who worked in an
automobile factory, and didn't even have a name, but was called
"Number 74."</p>

<p>All he did was to screw a nut on a steel plate when it was
thrown at him.</p>

<p>And they were thrown at him at the rate of twenty-five a
minute.</p>

<p>You would think with so much spare time on his hands that the
nut-screwer would get careless and discontented.</p>

<p>But not Number 74!</p>

<p>He set out to be the best nut-screwer in the factory, and took
steel plates home with him after his work was done, and got his
wife to throw them at him, and he practised far into the night.</p>

<p>And as time went on, the foreman noticed him, and told the chief
foreman about It. And the chief foreman told the sub-manager of the
department, and so it went on until at last the Great Managing
Director was brought to see the nimble nut-screwer at work.</p>

<p>"How long," he said to Number 74, "have you been screwing
nuts?"</p>

<p>"Fifteen years, sir."</p>

<p>"You are a good nut-screwer?"</p>

<p>"I am the best nut-screwer in the world, sir."</p>

<p>And the great man said "H'm!" and walked away.</p>

<p>And number 74 drew a deep breath and shook hands with himself,
and wondered if he would be made a director straight away, or if he
would have to spend a short time as sub-manager.</p>

<p>And later, the foreman came to him, and said, "I have a message
for you."</p>

<p>And Number 74 smiled.</p>

<p>"As you are the best nut-screwer in the world," said the
foreman, "I am directed to tell you that you will be kept on the
nut-screwing staff indefinitely, provided that you are of good
behavior, and don't slacken off, or get sick, or cheeky, or
anything like that."</p>

<p>And Number 74 said, "Thank you," very feebly, and fell on his
spanner and died.</p>

<p>And they threw his useless body out of the way, and engaged
another nut-screwer.</p>

<p>Which shows you that virtue is its own reward.</p>

<h2>A NOBLE ART OF ARGUMENT</h2>

<p>A good argument is like an avalanche. It starts easily, gathers
speed quickly, embraces everything in its downward swoop,
bystanders, passers-by and casual loiterers, mows down tempers,
courtesy and morals; leaps and richochets from one point to another
and finishes with a grand crash which necessitates the calling of
the ambulance and the police.</p>

<p>That is a good argument.</p>

<p>But countless puerile discussions take place every day in which
the participants all keep their tempers down and their coats on,
and generally behave in a manner which is a slur on the very name
of argument.</p>

<p>Of what earthly use is an argument if you don't lose your
temper?</p>

<p>What is more convincing than a punch on the nose? Nothing.
Unless it's a rabbit-killer on the back of the neck.</p>

<p>The right and ability to argue is one of Nature's, greatest
gifts to man, and should not be toyed with.</p>

<p>Despite the illustrious example set by some of our public men in
high places, there are still people totally unable to expound a
difference of opinion in the proper manner.</p>

<p>Can you think of anything more inspiring than a member of the
Legislative Assembly calling his honorable opponent a lying,
banana-spined pole-cat, and offering to bash his honorable face in
when he got the honorable blank outside?</p>

<p>Can you? You can! All right.</p>

<p>It is sickening to hear the despicable tactics of low-grade
arguers.</p>

<p>They will offer to bet you a pound that you are wrong. "Money
up, or shut up," is their chant.</p>

<p>If a pound can win an argument, why are we not all stricken to
dumb, awed, submissive silence, when passing the Commonwealth
Bank?</p>

<p>They drag in irrelevant details with the proud air of a tom-cat
dropping a dead rat on the breakfast-table.</p>

<p>"The milkman's brother said, and he ought to know&mdash;"</p>

<p>What the deuce has the milkman's brother got to do with Kay's
dismissal from the Meat Board?</p>

<p>And the backing and filling.</p>

<p>"Didn't you say soandso and soandso a while ago!" you point out,
triumphantly.</p>

<p>"Oo! I never said anything of the kind!</p>

<p>"I said&mdash;"</p>

<p>Argh!</p>

<p>Enough of these incompetents. I have a pleasant memory of two,
elderly men, retired from the strenuous activities of life, who
regularly met in Hyde Park to argue on the advantages and
disadvantages of federation. They kept it up for years.</p>

<p>Each day would find them there. Perhaps one, having thought of a
particularly telling point in the night watches, would arrive early
and wait, fuming with impatience, for the other. And so they
wrangled on through the years, until one day, one of them, in the
middle of a very heated passage, was stricken with apoplexy and
succumbed.</p>

<p>The last words he said were:</p>

<p>"Absolute rot! You're a liar!"</p>

<p>The other old gentleman, after vainly trying to carry on the
argument by talking to himself, simply pined away.</p>

<p>The night he died there was a terrific thunderstorm and the
lightning and hailstones that flew about have left me convinced
that there is an after-life.</p>

<p>But the fact stands out.</p>

<p>It is personality that counts in an argument.</p>

<p>Facts, logic, reason, eloquence, all have their place, but
personality is the thing. Be eloquent if you can. Be logical if
your side of the argument will stand it. You may even be reasonable
to a certain extent. State your facts, drive them home. If you run
out of facts, invent some, and drive them home, too.</p>

<p>But, best of all, exert your personality.</p>

<p>Face your man. Look him in the eye. Take off your coat. Roll up
your sleeves. Ask him, firmly, if he still thinks he is right.</p>

<p>If he puts his face close up to yours, glares at you, and says
he's SURE he's right&mdash;let him have his way.</p>

<p>Freedom of speech is a wonderful thing; every man is entitled to
his own opinions; some people are not worth arguing with, and,
anyhow, the loss of one argument is neither here nor there.</p>

<p>Go to a gymnasium and learn the principles of debate. Then try
again.</p>

<h2>THE VERY LATEST IN FISH YARNS<br>
JUST A MINUTE!</h2>

<p>Grafton, Friday.</p>

<p>Six feet two inches long, and weighing 232 pounds, a groper
pulled a rowing-boat with three men in it about the Clarence River,
below Grafton, for 20 minutes before the fishermen were able to
drag it close enough to the boat to secure it with a piece of wire
through its gills.</p>

<p>THEN there was the bait. A green prawn, weighing 180lb.,
including sinker, was cast off the rocks at Bondi and immediately
swam off, taking with it the fisherman, his two companions, and the
rocks.</p>

<p>Crashing into the Malolo (which sank immediately), the bait
continued, until finally it was taken by a groper, which was first
thought to be Tasmania.</p>

<p>Passing Africa, the three fishermen, who had been floating
without an excuse between them on the rocks for five days, decided
to haul in the line. The hook and sinker had gone.</p>

<p>The long swim back to Bond! left them exhausted, and a kindly
native revived them with a few rums.</p>

<p>Ultimately they arrived home. And their wives said,
"FISHING!"</p>

<p>And a few other things.</p>

<p>(Don't miss our next issue. Every weekend!)</p>
