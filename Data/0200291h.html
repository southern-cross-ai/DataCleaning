<h2>Cass Timberlane<br>
<i>A Novel of Husbands and Wives</i><br>
<br>
by<br>
<br>
Sinclair Lewis</h2>

<hr>

<h2>Author's Note</h2>

<p>The scene of this story, the small city of Grand Republic in
Central Minnesota, is entirely imaginary, as are all the
characters.</p>

<p>But I know that the characters will be "identified," each of
them with several different real persons in each of the Minnesota
cities in which I have happily lingered: in Minneapolis, St. Paul,
Winona, St. Cloud, Mankato, Fergus Falls and particularly, since it
is only a little larger than "Grand Republic" and since I live
there, in the radiant, sea-fronting, hillside city of Duluth.</p>

<p>All such guesses will be wrong, but they will be so convincing
that even the writer will be astonished to learn how exactly he has
drawn some judge or doctor or banker or housewife of whom he has
never heard, or regretful to discover how poisonously he is
supposed to have described people of whom he is particularly
fond.</p>

<p>Sinclair Lewis</p>

<hr>

<h2>Chapter 1</h2>

<p>Until Jinny Marshland was called to the stand, the Judge was
deplorably sleepy.</p>

<p>The case of Miss Tilda Hatter vs. the City of Grand Republic had
been yawning its way through testimony about a not very interesting
sidewalk. Plaintiff's attorney desired to show that the city had
been remarkably negligent in leaving upon that sidewalk a certain
lump of ice which, on February 7, 1941, at or about the hour of
9:37 P.M., had caused the plaintiff to slip, to slide, and to be
prone upon the public way, in a state of ignominy and sore pain.
There had been an extravagant amount of data as to whether the lump
of ice had been lurking sixteen, eighteen, or more than eighteen
feet from the Clipper Hardware Store. And all that May afternoon
the windows had been closed, to keep out street noises, and the
court room had smelled, as it looked, like a schoolroom.</p>

<p>Timberlane, J., was in an agony of drowsiness. He was faithful
enough, and he did not miss a word, but he heard it all as in sleep
one hears malignant snoring.</p>

<p>He was a young judge: the Honorable Cass Timberlane, of the
Twenty-Second Judicial District, State of Minnesota. He was
forty-one, and in his first year on the bench, after a term in
Congress. He was a serious judge, a man of learning, a believer in
the majesty of the law, and he looked like a tall Red Indian. But
he was wishing that he were out bass-fishing, or at home, reading
Walden or asleep on a cool leather couch.</p>

<p>Preferably asleep.</p>

<p>All the spectators in the room, all five of them, were yawning
and chewing gum. The learned counsel for the plaintiff, Mr. Hervey
Plint, the dullest lawyer in Grand Republic, a middle-aged man with
a miscellaneous sort of face, was questioning Miss Hatter. He was a
word-dragger, an uh'er, a looker to the ceiling for new
thoughts.</p>

<p>"Uh&mdash;Miss Hatter, now will you tell us what was
the&mdash;uh&mdash;the purpose of your going out, that
evening&mdash;I mean, I mean how did you happen to be out on an
evening which&mdash;I think all the previous testimony agrees that
it was, well, I mean, uh, you might call it an inclement evening,
but not such as would have prevented the, uh, the adequate cleaning
of the thoroughfares&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Jekshn leading quest," said the city attorney.</p>

<p>"Jekshn stained," said the Court.</p>

<p>"I will rephrase my question," confided Mr. Plint. He was a
willing rephraser, but the phrases always became duller and duller
and duller.</p>

<p>Sitting above them on the bench like Chief Iron Cloud, a lean
figure of power, the young father of his people, Judge Timberlane
started to repeat the list of presidents, a charm which usually
would keep him awake. He got through it fairly well, stumbling only
on Martin Van Buren and Millard Fillmore, as was reasonable, but he
remained as sleepy as ever.</p>

<p>Without missing any of Miss Hatter's more spectacular
statements, His Honor plunged into the Counties of Minnesota, all
eighty-seven of them, with their several county-seats:</p>

<blockquote>Aitkin&mdash;Aitkin<br>
Anoka&mdash;Anoka<br>
Becker&mdash;Detroit Lakes<br>
Beltrami&mdash;Bemidji</blockquote>

<p>He had reached "Olmsted&mdash;Rochester" when he perceived that
Miss Hatter had gone back to her natural mummy-case, and the clerk
was swearing in a witness who pricked His Honor into
wakefulness.</p>

<p>&mdash;How did I ever miss seeing her, in a city as small as
this? Certainly not four girls in town that are as pretty, he
reflected.</p>

<p>The new witness was a half-tamed hawk of a girl, twenty-three or
-four, not tall, smiling, lively of eye. The light edged gently the
clarity of her cheeks, but there was something daring in her
delicate Roman nose, her fierce black hair. Her gray suit indicated
prosperity, which in Grand Republic was respectability.</p>

<p>&mdash;Be an exciting kid to know, thought Timberlane, J., that
purist and precisionist and esteemed hunter of ducks, that
chess-player and Latinist, who was a man unmarried&mdash;at least,
unmarried since his recent and regrettable divorce.</p>

<p>The young woman alighted on the oak witness-chair like a swallow
on a tombstone.</p>

<p>Counselor Plint said gloomily, "Will you please just give us
your, uh, your name and profession and address, please?"</p>

<p>"Jinny Marshland&mdash;Virginia Marshland. I'm draftsman and
designer for the Fliegend Fancy Box and Pasteboard Toy
Manufacturing Company, and a kind of messenger&mdash;man of all
work."</p>

<p>"Residence, please."</p>

<p>"I live up in Pioneer Falls, mostly. I was born there, and I
taught school there for a while. But you mean here in Grand
Republic? I live with Miss Hatter, at 179 1/2 West Flandrau
Street."</p>

<p>Profoundly, as one who doubts the eternal course of the planets,
Mr. Plint worried, "You board with Miss Hatter?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>Jinny and Judge Cass Timberlane looked at each other. He had
been approving her voice. He loved his native city of Grand
Republic, and esteemed the housewifery and true loyal hearts of its
43,000 daughters, but it disturbed him that so many of them had
voices like the sound of a file being drawn across the edge of a
sheet of brass. But Miss Marshland's voice was light and flexible
and round.</p>

<p>&mdash;I <i>would</i> fall for a girl merely because she has
fine ankles and a clear voice, I who have maintained that the most
wretched error in all romances is this invariable belief that
because a girl has a good nose and a smooth skin, therefore she
will be agreeable to live with and&mdash;well, make love to. The
insanity that causes even superior men (meaning judges) to run
passionately after magpies with sterile hearts. This, after the
revelations of female deception I've seen in divorce proceedings. I
am corrupted by sentimentality.</p>

<p>Mr. Plint was fretting his bone. "Now, uh, Miss&mdash;Miss
Marshland. Oh, yes, precisely. Now as I was saying, Miss Marshland,
several people have testified that there was a party&mdash;anyway,
there were several guests at the Hatter residence that evening, and
there was more or less eating and drinking, and what we want to
know is, was there any sign&mdash;uh&mdash;I mean any sign of
intoxicating beverages being consumed, I mean, particularly by Miss
Hatter herself?"</p>

<p>"No, she drank a coke. I might take a cocktail sometimes, but
I'm sure Miss Hatter never touches a drop."</p>

<p>Charles Sayward, the city attorney, was roused from slumber to
protest, "I move the testimony be stricken, as hearsay and
irrelevant."</p>

<p>Judge Timberlane said gravely, "I must grant that motion, Mr.
Sayward, but don't you think you're being a little technical?"</p>

<p>"It is my humble understanding of court procedure, Your Honor,
that it is entirely technical."</p>

<p>(On the Heather Club golf course they called each other
"Charles" and "Cass.")</p>

<p>"On the other hand, Mr. City Attorney, you know that here in the
Middlewest we pride ourselves on being less formal than the stately
tribunals of Great Britain and our traditional East. I may be so
bold as to say that even in court, we're almost human, and that on
a day like this&mdash;you may not have noticed it, Mr. City
Attorney, but it is somewhat somnolent&mdash;then we frequently
permit any testimony that will give this jury&mdash;" He smiled at
the honest but bored citizens, "an actual picture of the issue.
However," and now he smiled at Jinny, "I think you'd better confine
yourself to answering the questions, without comment, Miss
Marshland. Motion granted. Continue, Mr. Plint."</p>

<p>As Jinny went on, without noticeably obeying the Court's
command, Cass felt that the court-room air was fresher, that there
might actually be some life and purpose to court proceedings. She
was perhaps twenty-four to his forty-one, but he insisted that
Jinny and he were young together, and in antagonism to the
doddering Mr. Plint, the cobwebbed and molding Charles Sayward (who
was thirty-five, by the records) and the Assyrian antiquity of the
jury.</p>

<p>He wanted to lean over the sharp oak edge of his lofty desk and
demand of Jinny, "See here. You know the jury will give the Hatter
woman approximately half of whatever she's suing for, no matter
what nonsense we grind out. Let's go off and forget all this. I
want to talk to you, and make it clear that I can be light-minded
and companionable."</p>

<p>But it came to him that this would not be the way to impress
Jinny. She thought that he was a judge and a venerable figure; she
probably thought that he was more columnar than her young suitors
with their dancing and babble. He straightened, he placed his right
forefinger senatorially against his cheek, he cleared his throat,
and for her, glancing down to see if he was successfully fooling
her, he pretended that he was a judge on a bench.</p>

<p>She was explaining, to Mr. Plint's prompting, that she boarded
at Miss Hatter's, along with Tracy Oleson (secretary to that
industrial titan, Mr. Wargate), Lyra Coggs the librarian, Eino
Roskinen, and three other young people. They were artistic and
pretty refined. No indeed, they never got drunk, and if Tilda
Hatter slipped on any ole lump of ice, that lump of ice was meant
to be slipped on. Yes, she liked working for the Fliegend Company.
She wasn't, she beamed, much of a draftsman, but Mr. and Mrs.
Fliegend were so kind. She liked it better than schoolteaching; you
had to be so solemn in school.</p>

<p>She was not loquacious so much as gay and natural. It was all
fantastically irregular, but City Attorney Sayward had given up
trying to check her, and he looked up at Judge Timberlane with
humorous helplessness. The jury yearned over her as though they
were her collective parent, and Counselor Plint had a notion,
though he didn't know how in the world it had come about, that she
was a useful witness.</p>

<p>Only George Hame, the court reporter, was unmoved, as he made
his swift symbols in a pulpy-looking notebook. To George, all
accents and all moods, the shrieks of the widows of murdered
bootleggers, the droning of certified accountants explaining
crooked ledgers, the grumble of Finnish or Polish homesteaders,
were the same. What was said never seemed the important thing to
George, but whether he got it all down. The judge, his captain,
could be unprofessionally enlivened by an unnecessary girl witness,
after only five months on the bench, but George did not believe in
women. He had a wife unremittingly productive of babies, for whose
assembly-belt production he felt only accidentally responsible, and
after sixteen years of court reporting, all witnesses, pretty or
otherwise, were to him merely lumps of potato in a legal hash that
was nourishing but tedious.</p>

<p>Jinny Marshland finished her testimony, smiled at Cass, smiled
at Tilda Hatter, and slipped out of the court room like a trout
flicking down a stream. The case reverted to mumbling, and the
Judge reverted to the list of Minnesota counties and to a
sleepiness which made his shoulders ache, his eyes feel dusty and
swollen. With his right hand, the large hand of a woodsman or a
hunter, he gravely stroked the lapel of his dark-gray jacket,
smoothed his painfully refined dark-blue tie, as he repeated:</p>

<blockquote>Otter Tail County&mdash;Fergus Falls<br>
Pennington&mdash;Thief River Falls<br>
Pine&mdash;Pine City<br>
Pipestone&mdash;Pipestone</blockquote>

<p>Till half an hour ago he had been proud of the court room; of
his high oak desk, jutting into the room like a prow, with a silken
American flag, topped with a small gold eagle, erected beside the
Judge's leather chair. He had been proud of the carved seal of
Minnesota on the oak paneling behind the bench; of the restful
dark-gray plaster walls; of the resplendently shiny oak benches,
though they were hard upon the restless anatomy of the aching
public. He had felt secure and busy, for this was his workshop, his
studio, his laboratory, in which he was an artist-scientist,
contributing to human progress and honor.</p>

<p>Now it was a stuffy coop, absurdly small for a court room,
barely able to hold eighty people when crowded. Such portions of
the Eternal Law as were represented by the Statutes of the State of
Minnesota seemed dreary today, and he wanted to be out in the May
breeze, walking with Jinny Marshland.</p>

<p>Cass was considered a conscientious judge, but he adjourned
today at five minutes before the usual four o'clock. He could eat
no more bran.</p>

<p>Before he could hasten out into the open air, however, he still
had half an hour of chamber work. He was rather proud of Chambers
No. 3, Radisson County Court House. On his election, when he had
taken the room over, it already looked scholarly and solid, with a
cliff of law-books, a long oak table, a council of black leather
chairs, and he had added the framed photographs of Justices Holmes,
Cardozo, and Brandeis...and of the historic bag of ducks that Dr.
Roy Drover and he had shot in 1939. On his portly desk was a
handsome bronze inkwell which he never used, and a stupendous
bronze automatic cigar-lighter&mdash;a gift&mdash;which he had
always disliked.</p>

<p>He had to sign an injunction, to talk with a Swede who desired
to be naturalized. Young Vincent Osprey, who overlaid with a high
Yale Law School gloss a dullness almost equal to that of Mr. Hervey
Plint, brought in a woman client, on the theory that she wanted
wholesome advice about her coming divorce suit. She did not want
advice; she wanted to get rid of her present spouse so that she
could marry another with a more powerful kiss. But in most judicial
districts of Minnesota, domestic-relations procedure is as fatherly
and informal as a physician's consultation, and Cass held forth to
her.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Nelson, a woman or a man has only four or five real
friendships in his whole life. To lose one of them is to lose a
chance to give and to trust. Am I being too discursive?"</p>

<p>"I t'ink so."</p>

<p>"Well look, Mrs. Carlson&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Nelson."</p>

<p>"&mdash;Nelson. Look. In a divorce, the children are terrified.
Have you any children?"</p>

<p>"Not by Nelson."</p>

<p>Judge Timberlane glanced at Mr. Osprey and shook his head. The
lawyer yelped, "All right, Mrs. Nelson, you skip along now. That's
all His Honor has to say."</p>

<p>When they were alone, Cass turned to Osprey, and it was to be
seen that Osprey was his admirer.</p>

<p>"No use, Vince. Let it go through. I figure she's hot to gallop
to another marriage-bed. Otherwise I'd give her a red-hot lecture
on the humiliations of divorce. I will facilitate any divorce, in
case of cruelty&mdash;or extreme boredom, which is worse&mdash;but,
Vince, divorce is hell. Don't you ever divorce Cerise, no matter
how extravagant you say she is."</p>

<p>"You bet your life I wouldn't, Chief. I'm crazy about that
girl."</p>

<p>"You're lucky. If it weren't for my work, my life would be as
empty as a traitor's after a war. Ever since Blanche divorced
me&mdash; why, Vince, I have nobody to show my little tin triumphs
to. I envy Cerise and you. And I don't seem to find any girl that
will take Blanche's place."</p>

<p>As he spoke, Cass was reflecting that, after all, Jinny
Marshland was just another migratory young woman.</p>

<p>"But what about Christabel Grau, Chief? I thought you and she
were half engaged," bubbled Vincent Osprey.</p>

<p>"Oh, Chris is a very kind girl. I guess that's the trouble. I
apparently want somebody who's so intelligent that she'll think I'm
stupid, so independent that she'll never need me, so gay and daring
that she'll think I'm slow. That's my pattern, Vince; that's my
fate."</p>

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>

<p>The city of Grand Republic, Radisson County, Minnesota, eighty
miles north of Minneapolis, seventy-odd miles from Duluth, has
85,000 population.</p>

<p>It is large enough to have a Renoir, a school-system scandal,
several millionaires, and a slum. It lies in the confluent valleys
where the Big Eagle River empties into the Sorshay River, which
flows west to the Mississippi.</p>

<p>Grand Republic grew rich two generations ago through the uncouth
robbery of forests, iron mines, and soil for wheat. With these
almost exhausted, it rests in leafy quiet, wondering whether to
become a ghost town or a living city. The Chamber of Commerce says
that it has already become a city, but, in secret places where the
two bankers on the school board cannot hear them, the better
schoolteachers deny this.</p>

<p>At least there is in Grand Republic a remarkable number of
private motor cars. It was a principal cause of his reputation for
eccentricity that Cass Timberlane, on amiable spring days, walked
the entire mile and a quarter from the court house to his home.</p>

<p>He climbed up Joseph Renshaw Brown Way to Ottawa Heights, on
which were the Renoir and the millionaires and most of the houses
provided with Architecture.</p>

<p>He looked down on the Radisson County Court House, in which was
his own court room, and he did not shudder. He was fondly
accustomed to its romanticism and blurry inconvenience.</p>

<p>It had been built in 1885 from the designs of an architect who
was drunk upon Howard Pyle's illustrations to fairy tales. It was
of a rich red raspberry brick trimmed with limestone, and it
displayed a round tower, an octagonal tower, a minaret, a massive
entrance with a portcullis, two lofty flying balconies of iron,
colored-glass windows with tablets or stone petals in the niches
above them, a green and yellow mosaic roof with scarlet edging, and
the breathless ornamental stairway from the street up to the main
entrance without which no American public building would be
altogether legal.</p>

<p>Cass knew that it was as archaic as armor and even less
comfortable, yet he loved it as a symbol of the ancient and
imperial law. It was his Westminster, his Sorbonne; it was the one
place in which he was not merely a male in vulgar trousers, but a
spiritual force such as might, with a great deal of luck and
several hundreds of years, help to make of Grand Republic another
Edinburgh.</p>

<p>He had, too, an ancestral proprietary right in this legal
palace, for his father had started off his furniture business
(wholesale as well as retail, and therefore noble) by providing
most of the chairs and desks for the court house.</p>

<p>When he had reached Varennes Boulevard, circling along the
cliffs on top of Ottawa Heights, Cass could see the whole city, the
whole valley, with the level oat and barley fields on the uplands
beyond. The Big Eagle River came in from the south, bearing the hot
murmurous air from the great cornfields, from the country of the
vanquished Sioux; the Sorshay River, which had been called the
Sorcier by the coureurs de bois, two hundred years ago, wound from
a northern darkness of swamp and lakes and impenetrable jackpine
thickets, the country of the tawny Chippewas.</p>

<p>At the junction of the rivers was the modern city, steel and
cement and gasoline and electricity, as contemporary as Chicago if
but one-fortieth the size and devoid of the rich raucousness of the
Loop. The limestone magnificence of the Wargate Memorial Auditorium
and the titanic Blue Ox National Bank Building (no less than twelve
stories), the carved and educated granite of the Alexander Hamilton
High School, the Pantheon of the Duluth &amp; Twin Cities Railroad
Station, the furnaces and prodigious brick sheds of the Wargate
Wood Products Corporation plant and a setting of smaller factories,
were all proofs of the Chamber of Commerce's assertion that in a
short time, perhaps twenty years or twenty centuries, Grand
Republic would have a million inhabitants.</p>

<p>But beyond the tracks, along the once navigable Sorshay River,
the wooden warehouses and shaky tenements were so like the frontier
village of seventy-five years ago that you imagined the wooden
sidewalks of the 1860's and the streets a churning of mud, with
Chippewa squaws and Nova Scotia lumbermen in crimson jackets and
weekly murder with axe handles. Very untidy.</p>

<p>Indeed Mrs. Kenny Wargate, Manhattan-born and cynical
daughter-in-law of the Ruling Family, asserted that Grand Republic
had leaped from clumsy youth to senility without ever having a
dignified manhood. She jeered, "Your Grand Republic slogan is:
tar-paper shanty to vacant parking lot in three generations."</p>

<p>But Judge Timberlane and his friends, loving the place as home,
believed that just now, after woes and failures and haste and waste
and experiment, Grand Republic was beginning to build up a kind of
city new to the world, a city for all the people, a city for
decency and neighborliness, not for ecclesiastical display and
monarchial power and the chatter of tamed journalists and
professors drinking coffee and eating newspapers in cafes. And if
so many of the pioneers had been exploiters and slashers of the
forest, the Wargates had been and now were builders of industries
that meant homes and food for hundreds of immigrant families from
the fiords, from New England hills.</p>

<p>Cass often pondered thus as he walked along Varennes Boulevard.
As he rounded a curve of the bluff-top, he could look northward,
and there, at the city's edge, was the true Northland, in the
stretches of pine and birch and poplar that framed the grim eye of
Dead Squaw Lake. And he loved it as he could never love the lax and
steamy and foolishly laughing isles he had once seen in the
Caribbean.<br>
<br></p>

<p>Through all of his meditation ran his startled remembrance of
Jinny Marshland on the witness stand. He was still indignant that
in a city so small as Grand Republic he had never seen her.</p>

<p>But he knew that, for all his talk at public dinners about
Midwestern Democracy, the division between the proprietors and the
serfs was as violent in Grand Republic as in London. The
truckdriver might call Boone Havock, the contractor, "Boone," when
they met in the Eitelfritz Brauhaus (as with remarkable frequency
they did meet), but he would never enter Boone's house or his
church, and as for Boone's asylum, the Federal Club, neither the
truckdriver nor any Scandinavian or Finn with less than $10,000
income nor any recognizable Jew whatever would be allowed even to
gawk through the leaded-glass windows (imported).</p>

<p>Even Lucius Fliegend, Jinny's Jewish employer, that fine and
sensitive old man, could not belong to the Federal Club, but had to
play his noontime chess in the Athletic Club. And as a professing
member of Democracy, Cass was ashamed that not since he had been
elected judge had he once been in the Athletic Club.</p>

<p>He would remedy that right away. Tomorrow.</p>

<p>He was abnormally conscious of the universal and multiple
revolution just then, in the early 1940's, from sulfa drugs and
surrealism and semantics to Hitler, but he was irritated by all the
Voices, by the radio prophets and the newspaper-column
philosophers. He had had two competent years in Washington as a
Member of Congress. Sick of the arguments, he had refused to be
re-elected, yet now that he was back in his native town, sometimes
he missed the massacres in the Coliseum, and felt a little bored
and futile.</p>

<p>And ever since his divorce from the costly and clattering
Blanche, he had been lonely. Could a Jinny Marshland cure his
loneliness, his confusions in the skyrocketing world?</p>

<p>Then he rebuked himself.</p>

<p>Why should a charming girl, probably a dancer to phonographs,
have any desire to cure the lonelinesses of forty-year-old single
gentlemen? There was tenderness and loyalty in Jinny, he felt, but
what would she want with a judge whom she would find out not to be
a judge at all but another gaunt and early-middle-aged man who
played the flute? Thus he raged and longed as he neared his house.
It is understood that the newer psychiatrists, like the older
poets, believe that patients do fall in love at first sight.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br></p>

<p>Cass's house was sometimes known as "Bergheim" and sometimes as
"the old Eisenherz place." It had been built as a summer
residence&mdash;in those days it had seemed to be quite out in the
country&mdash;by Simon Eisenherz, greatest of the Radisson County
pioneers, in 1888, and purchased by Cass's father, Owen Timberlane,
in 1929. Owen had died there, less than a year later, leaving it
jointly to his wife, Marah, and to Cass, along with a local fortune
of forty or fifty thousand dollars.</p>

<p>The house was somber and somehow tragic, and when Cass's mother
died there, also, and he took Blanche, his wife, to it, she had
hated it as much as he himself loved it. As a boy he had considered
it the wonderful castle, the haunt of power and beauty, which no
ordinary mortal like a Timberlane could ever hope to own complete.
He still felt so.</p>

<p>George Hame, his court reporter, said that Bergheim was a wooden
model of the court house, and it did have a circular tower and an
octagonal conservatory, now called the "sun room." It was painted a
dark green, merely because it had always been painted dark green.
Over the porches there were whole gardens of jig-saw blossoms, and
two of the windows were circular, and one triangular, with ruby
glass. Cass admitted everything derisive that was said about this
monstrosity, and went on loving it, and explaining that if you
opened all of the windows all of the time, it wasn't airless
inside&mdash;not very&mdash;not on a breezy day.</p>

<p>As he came up the black-and-white marble walk to the bulbous
carriage-porch, a black kitten, an entire stranger, was sitting on
a step. It said "meow," not whiningly but in a friendly mood, as
between equals, and it looked at Cass in a way that dared him to
invite it in for a drink.</p>

<p>He was a lover of cats, and he had had none since the ancient
and misanthropic Stephen had died, six months before. He had a
lively desire to own this little black clown, all black, midnight
black, except for its sooty yellow eyes. It would play on the faded
carpets when he came home from the court room to the still
loneliness that, in the old house, was getting on his nerves.</p>

<p>"Well, how are you, my friend?" he said.</p>

<p>The kitten said she was all right. And about some cream
now&mdash;?</p>

<p>"Kitten, I can't steal you from some child who's out looking for
you. It wouldn't be right to invite you in."</p>

<p>The kitten did not answer anything so naive and prudish. It
merely said, with its liquid and trusting glance, that Cass was its
god, beyond all gods. It frisked, and dabbled at a fly with its
tiny black paw, and looked up at him to ask, "How's that?"</p>

<p>"You are a natural suborner of perjury and extremely sweet,"
admitted Cass, as he scooped it up and took it through the huge oak
door, down the dim hallway to the spacious kitchen and to Mrs.
Higbee, his cook-general.</p>

<p>Mrs. Higbee was sixty years old, and what is known as "colored,"
which meant that she was not quite so dark of visage as Webb
Wargate after his annual Florida tanning. She was graceful and
sensible and full of love and loyalty. She was in no way a comic
servant; she was like any other wholesome Middle-Class American,
with an accent like that of any other emigree from Ohio. It must be
said that Mrs. Higbee was not singularly intelligent; only slightly
more intelligent than Mrs. Boone Havock or Mrs. Webb Wargate; not
more than twice as intelligent as Mrs. Vincent Osprey. She was an
Episcopalian, and continued to be one, for historic reasons, though
she was not greatly welcomed in the more fashionable temples of
that faith. Judge Timberlane depended on her good sense rather more
than he did on that of George Hame or his friend Christabel
Grau.</p>

<p>Mrs. Higbee took the black kitten, tickled it under the chin,
and remarked. "Our cat?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid so. I've stolen it."</p>

<p>"Well, I understand a black cat is either very good luck or very
bad luck, I forget which, so we can take a chance on it. What's its
name?"</p>

<p>"What is it? A her?"</p>

<p>"Let's see. Um, I think so."</p>

<p>"How about 'Cleo'? You know&mdash;from Cleopatra. The Egyptians
worshiped cats, and Cleopatra was supposed to be thin and dark and
uncanny, like our kitten."</p>

<p>But he was not thinking of Queen Cleopatra. He was thinking of
Jinny Marshland, and the thought was uneasy with him.</p>

<p>"All right, Judge. You, Cleo, I'm going to get those fleas off
you right away tomorrow, and no use your kicking."</p>

<p>Cass marveled, "Has she got fleas?"</p>

<p>"Has&mdash;she&mdash;got&mdash;fleas! Judge, don't you ever take
a real good look at females?"</p>

<p>"Not often. Oh, Mrs. Higbee, you know I'm dining out
tonight&mdash;at Dr. Drover's."</p>

<p>"Yes. You'll get guinea hen. And that caramel ice cream. And
Miss Grau. You won't be home early."</p>

<p>"Anything else I ought to know about the party?"</p>

<p>"Not a thing...Will you look at that Cleo! She knows where the
refrigerator is, already!"<br>
<br></p>

<p>In Cass's set, which was largely above the $7000 line, it was as
obligatory to dress for party dinners as in London, and anyway, he
rather liked his solid tallness in black and white. He dawdled in
his bedroom, not too moonily thinking of Jinny yet conscious of
her. A bright girl like that would do things with this room which,
he admitted, habit and indifference and too much inheritance of
furniture had turned into a funeral vault. It was a long room with
meager windows and a fireplace bricked-up years ago.</p>

<p>The wide bed was of ponderous black walnut, carved with cherubs
that looked like grapes and grapes that looked like cherubs, and on
it was a spread of yellowed linen. The dresser was of black walnut
also, with a mortuary marble slab; the wardrobe was like three
mummy-cases on end, though not so gay; and littered over everything
were books on law and economics and Minnesota history.</p>

<p>"It is a gloomy room. No wonder Blanche insisted on sleeping in
the pink room."</p>

<p>He heard a friendly, entirely conversational "Meow?" and saw
that the gallant Cleo had come upstairs to explore. All cats have
to know about every corner of any house they choose to honor, but
sometimes they are timid about caves under furniture. There have,
indeed, been complaining and tiresome cats. But Cleo talked to him
approvingly about her new home.</p>

<p>For so young and feminine a feline, she was a complete Henry M.
Stanley. She looked at the old bedspread and patted its fringe. She
circulated around under the old Chinese teakwood chair, in which no
one had ever sat and which no one even partly sane would ever have
bought. She glanced into the wardrobe, and cuffed a shoelace which
tried to trip her.</p>

<p>She said, "All right&mdash;fine" to Cass, and went on to the
other rooms.</p>

<p>In that stilly house he continued to hear her jaunty cat-slang
till she had gone into the gray room, the last and largest of the
six master's-bedrooms. Then he jumped, at a long and terrified
moan. He hurried across the hall. Cleo was crouched, staring at the
bed upon which had died his mother, that silent and bitter woman
christened Marah Nord.</p>

<p>The tiny animal shivered and whimpered till he compassionately
snatched it up and cuddled it at his neck. It shivered once more
and, as he took it back to his own den, it began timidly to purr,
in a language older than the Egyptian.</p>

<p>"Too many ghosts in this house, Cleo. You must drive them
out&mdash;you and <i>she</i>. I have lived too long among
shadows."</p>

<h2>Chapter 3</h2>

<p>Bound for Dr. Drover's and the presumable delights of dinner, he
walked down Varennes Boulevard, past the houses of the very great:
the red-roofed Touraine chateau of Webb Wargate, the white-pillared
brick Georgian mansion (with a terrace, and box-trees in wine jars)
of the fabulous contractor, Boone Havock, and the dark granite
donjon and the bright white Colonial cottage (oversize) in which
dwelt and mutually hated each other the rival bankers Norton Trock
and John William Prutt.</p>

<p>On his judge's salary, without the inheritance from his father,
Cass could never have lived in this quarter. It was the Best
Section; it was Mayfair, where only Episcopalians, Presbyterians,
Congregationalists, and the more Gothic Methodists&mdash;all
Republicans and all golf-players&mdash;lived on a golden isle amid
the leaden surges of democracy.</p>

<p>He turned left on Schoolcraft Way, into a neighborhood not so
seraphic yet still soundly apostolic and Republican, and came to
the square yellow-brick residence of his friend, Dr. Roy Drover.
Roy said, and quite often, that his place might not be so fancy as
some he knew, but it was the only completely air-conditioned house
in town, and it had, in the Etruscan catacombs of its basement, the
most powerful oil furnace and the best game-room, or rumpus
room&mdash; with a red-and-silver bar, a billiard table, a
dance-floor, and a rifle-range&mdash;in all of Grand Republic,
which is to say in all of the Western Hemisphere.</p>

<p>With the possible exception of Bradd Criley the lawyer, Dr.
Drover was Cass's closest friend.</p>

<p>Roy was two years older than Cass, who was two years older than
Bradd, and it is true that in boyhood, four years make a
generation, yet from babyhood to college days, Cass and Roy and
Bradd had formed an inseparable and insolently exclusive gang, to
the terror of all small animals within hiking distance of Grand
Republic. They did such pleasurable killing together; killing
frogs, killing innocent and terrified snakes, killing gophers, and
later, when they reached the maturity of shot guns, killing ducks
and snipe and rabbits. Like Indians they had roamed this old
Chippewa Indian land, familiars of swamp and crick (not creek),
cousins to the mink and mushrat (not muskrat), heroes of swimming
hole and ice-skating and of bobsledding down the long, dangerous
Ottawa Heights. And once, finding a midden filled with stone
slivers, they had been very near to their closest kin, the unknown
Indians of ten thousand years ago, who came here for stone weapons
when the last glacier was retreating.</p>

<p>Growing older, they had shown variations of civilization and
maturity. Bradd Criley had become a fancy fellow, wavy-haired and
slick about his neckties, a dancing man and a seducer of girls,
adding industry to his natural talents for the destruction of
women. Cass Timberlane had gone bookish and somewhat moral. Only
Roy Drover, graduating from medical school and becoming a neat
surgeon, a shrewd diagnostician, a skillful investor of money and,
before forty, a rich man, had remained entirely unchanged, a savage
and a small boy.</p>

<p>He preferred surgery, but in a city as small as Grand Republic,
he could not specialize entirely, and he kept up his practice as a
physician.</p>

<p>At forty-three, Dr. Drover looked fifty. He was a large man,
tall as Cass Timberlane and much thicker, with a frontier mustache,
a long black 1870-cavalryman mustache, a tremendous evangelical
voice, and a wide but wrinkled face.</p>

<p>In a way, he was not a doctor at all. He cared nothing for
people except as he could impress them with his large house, his
log fishing-lodge, named "Roy's Rest," in the Arrowhead Lake
Region, and his piratical airplane trips to Florida, where he
noisily played roulette and, taking no particular pains to conceal
it from his wife, made love to manicure girls posing as movie
actresses and completely fooling the contemptuously shrewd Dr.
Drover.</p>

<p>When Roy was drunk&mdash;that did not happen often, and never on
a night before he was to operate&mdash;he got into fights with
doormen and taxi-drivers, and always won them, and always got
forgiven by the attendant policeman, who recognized him as one of
their own hearty sort, as a medical policeman.</p>

<p>He played poker, very often and rather late, and he usually won.
He read nothing except the Journal of the American Medical
Association, the newspapers, and his ledger. Because he liked to
have humble customers call him "Doc," he believed that he was a
great democrat, but he hated all Jews, Poles, Finns, and people
from the Balkans, and he always referred to Negroes as "darkies" or
"smokes."</p>

<p>He said loudly, "Speaking as a doctor, I must tell you that it
is a scientifically proven fact that all darkies, without
exception, are mentally just children, and when you hear of a smart
one, he's just quoting from some renegade white man. Down South, at
Orlando, I got to talking to some black caddies, and they said,
'Yessir, Mr. White Man, you're dead right. We don't want to go
No'th. Up there, they put you to work!' All the darkies are lazy
and dumb, but that's all right with me. They'll never have a better
friend than I am, and they all know it, because they can see I
understand 'em!"</p>

<p>Roy's most disgusted surprise had been in meeting a New York
internist who told him that in that Sidon there was an orchestra
made up of doctors, who put their spare time in on Mozart instead
of duck-hunting.</p>

<p>From land investments, which he made in co-operation with Norton
Trock, Roy had enough capital to make sure that his two sons would
not have to be driven and martyred doctors, like him, but could
become gentlemanly brokers.</p>

<p>Roy and his pallid wife, Lillian, were considered, in Grand
Republic, prime examples of the Happy Couple.</p>

<p>She hated him, and dreaded his hearty but brief embraces, and
prayed that he would not turn the two boys, William Mayo Drover and
John Erdmann Drover, into his sort of people, Sound, Sensible,
Successful Citizens with <i>No Nonsense about Them</i>.<br>
<br></p>

<p>Cass Timberlane knew, in moments of mystic enlightenment, that
whether or not Roy Drover was his best friend, there was no
question but that Roy was his most active enemy.</p>

<p>He had for years mocked Cass's constant reading, his legal
scruples, his failure to make slick investments, and his shocking
habit of listening to Farmer-Laborites. After Cass had become a
judge, Roy grumbled, "I certainly wish I could make my money as
easy as that guy does&mdash;sitting up there on his behind and
letting the other fellows do the work." Tonight, Cass sighed that
Roy would certainly ridicule Jinny Marshland, if he ever met that
young woman.</p>

<p>But Roy had been his intimate since before he could remember.
There had never been any special reason for breaking with him and,
like son with father, like ex-pupil with ex-teacher, Cass had an
uneasy awe of his senior and a longing&mdash;entirely
futile&mdash;to make an impression on him. Cass's pride in being
elected to Congress and the bench was less than in being a better
duck-shot than Roy.<br>
<br></p>

<p>There were present, for dinner and two tables of bridge, the
Drovers, Cass, Christabel Grau, the Boone Havocks, and the Don
Pennlosses.</p>

<p>Chris Grau was the orphaned daughter of a wagon-manufacturer.
She was much younger than the others, and she was invited as an
extra-woman partner for Cass. She was a plump and rather sweet
spinster of thirty-two who, until the recent taking off, had
suffered from too much affectionate mother. She not only believed
that in the natural course of events Cass would fall in love with
her and marry her, but also that there is any natural course of
events. Rose Pennloss, wife of the rather dull and quite pleasant
Donald, the grain-dealer, was Cass's sister, but Cass and she liked
each other and let each other alone.</p>

<p>It was Boone Havock and his immense and parrot-squawking wife
Queenie who were the great people, the belted earl and terraced
countess, of the occasion; they were somewhat more energetic and
vastly more wealthy than Dr. Drover, and it was said that Boone was
one of the sixteen most important men in Minnesota.</p>

<p>He had started as a lumberjack and saloon-bouncer and miner and
prizefighter&mdash;indeed, he had never left off, and his success
in railroad-contracting, bridge-building, and factory-construction
was due less to his knowledge of how to handle steel than to his
knowledge of how to battle with steel-workers. But he owned much of
the stock in the genteel Blue Ox National Bank, and he was received
with flutters in the gray-velvet and stilly office of the
bank-president, Norton Trock.</p>

<p>Queenie Havock had the brassiest voice and the most predictable
anti-labor prejudices in Grand Republic; her hair looked like
brass, and her nose looked somewhat like brass, and she was such a
brass-hearted, cantankerous, vain, grasping, outrageous old brazen
harridan that people describing her simply had to add, "But Queenie
does have such a sense of humor and such a kind heart."</p>

<p>It was true. She had the odd and interesting sense of humor of a
grizzly bear.<br>
<br></p>

<p>For a town which was shocked by the orgies of New York and
Hollywood, there was a good deal of drinking in Grand Republic. All
of them, except Chris Grau and Roy Drover, had three cocktails
before dinner. Roy had four.</p>

<p>Throughout dinner, and during vacations from the toil of bridge,
the standard conversation of their class and era was carried on. If
Cass and his sister, Rose, did not chime in, they were too
accustomed to the liturgy to be annoyed by it.</p>

<p>This was the credo, and four years later, the war would make
small difference in its articles:</p>

<p>Maids and laundresses are now entirely unavailable; nobody at
all has any servants whatsoever; and those who do have, pay too
much and get nothing but impertinence.</p>

<p>Strikes must be stopped by law, but the Government must never in
any way interfere with industry.</p>

<p>All labor leaders are crooks. The rank and file are all
virtuous, but misled by these leaders.</p>

<p>The rank and file are also crooks.</p>

<p>Children are now undisciplined and never go to bed till
all-hours, but when we were children, we went to bed early and
cheerfully.</p>

<p>All public schools are atrocious, but it is not true that the
teachers are underpaid, and, certainly, taxes must be kept
down.</p>

<p>Taxes, indeed, are already so oppressive that not one of the
persons here present knows where his next meal or even his next
motor car will come from, and these taxes are a penalty upon the
industrious and enterprising, imposed by a branch of the Black Hand
called "Bureaucracy."</p>

<p>America will not get into this war between Hitler and Great
Britain, which will be over by June, 1942.</p>

<p>But we are certainly against Fascism&mdash;because
why?&mdash;because Fascism just means Government Control, and we're
against Government Control in Germany <i>or</i> in the United
States! When our Government quits interfering and gives Industry
the green light to go ahead, then we'll show the world what the
American System of Free Enterprise can do to provide universal
prosperity.</p>

<p>Boone Havock can still, at sixty, lick any seven Squareheads in
his construction gangs; he carries on his enterprises not for
profit&mdash; for years and years that has been entirely consumed
by these taxes&mdash; but solely out of a desire to give work to
the common people. He once provided a fine running shower-bath for
a gang in Kittson County, but none of the men ever used it, and
though he himself started with a shovel, times have changed since
then, and all selfless love for the job has departed.</p>

<p>Dr. Drover also carries on solely out of patriotism.</p>

<p>The wife of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, a woman who has so
betrayed her own class that she believes that miners and Negroes
and women are American citizens, ought to be compelled by law to
stay home.</p>

<p>We rarely go to the movies, but we did just happen to see a
pretty cute film about gang-murder.</p>

<p>The Reverend Dr. Quentin Yarrow, pastor of St. Anselm's P.E., is
a fine man, very broad-minded and well-read, and just as ready to
take a drink or shoot a game of golf as any regular guy.</p>

<p>Jay Laverick, of the flour mills, is a fine man, a regular guy,
always ready to shoot a game of golf or take a drink, but he has
been hitting up the hard stuff pretty heavy since his little wife
passed away, and he ought to remarry.</p>

<p>Cass should certainly remarry, and we suspect that it is Chris
Grau, also present, whom Cass has chosen and already
kissed&mdash;at least.</p>

<p>You can't change human nature.</p>

<p>We don't fall for any of these 'isms.</p>

<p>While we appreciate wealth&mdash;it shows that a man has
ability&mdash;maybe Berthold Eisenherz, with his brewery and half
the properties on the Blue Ox Range that are still producing iron
ore, and this damn showy picture of his by some Frenchman named
Renoir, is <i>too</i> wealthy. He never shoots golf or shoots
ducks, which looks pretty queer for a man rich as that. What the
devil does he do with himself?</p>

<p>Some of these smart-aleck critics claim that Middlewestern
businessmen haven't changed much since that book&mdash;what's its
name?&mdash; by this Communist writer, Upton
Sinclair&mdash;"Babbitt," is it?&mdash;not changed much since that
bellyache appeared, some twenty years ago. Well, we'd like to tell
those fellows that in these twenty-odd years, the American
businessman has changed completely. He has traveled to Costa Rica
and Cuba and Guatemala, as well as Paris, and in the Reader's
Digest he has learned all about psychology and modern education.
He's been to a symphony concert, and by listening to the
commentators on the radio, he has now become intimate with every
branch of Foreign Affairs.</p>

<p>"As an ex-Congressman, don't you think that's true?" demanded
Don Pennloss.</p>

<p>"Why, I guess it is," said Cass.<br>
<br></p>

<p>He had tried to bring into the conversation the name of Jinny
Marshland, but he had found no links between her and taxes or Costa
Rica. Now he blurted, "Say, I had a pleasant experience in court
today."</p>

<p>Roy Drover scoffed, "You mean you're still working there? The
State still paying you good money for just yelling 'Overruled!'
every time a lawyer belches?"</p>

<p>"They seem to be. Well, we had a pretty dull sidewalk case but
one witness was an unusually charming girl&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We know. You took her into your chambers and conferred with
her!" bellowed Boone Havock.</p>

<p>"He did not. He's no fat wolf like you, you lumberjack!"
screamed Queenie.</p>

<p>"Good gracious, I didn't know it was so late. Quarter past
eleven. Can I give you a lift, Cass?" said Chris Grau.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4</h2>

<p>"I'll drop you at your house, and if you ask me very prettily,
I'll come in for a night-cap," said Chris, outside the
Drovers'.</p>

<p>"No, I'll tell you: I'll drive you home in your car, and then
walk back to my house."</p>

<p>"Walk? Back? At this time of night? Why, it's almost two
miles!"</p>

<p>"People have walked two miles."</p>

<p>"Not unless they were playing golf."</p>

<p>"All right, I'll borrow a cane from Roy and a condensed-milk can
and knock it all the way back."</p>

<p>"Cassy, you are the most contrary man living!"</p>

<p>He hated being called "Cassy," like a slave in Harriet Beecher
Stowe, and he did not want Chris at his house. For the hour or two
before he went to bed, late as usual, he wanted to be alone. He had
to look after the welfare of his new friend, Cleo. He wanted to
think, at least to think of what it was that he wanted to think
about. And, like most men who sometimes complain of being lonely,
he just liked to be alone.</p>

<p>Chris did not go on teasing him. He had to admit that, fusser
and arranger and thwarted mother though she was, Chris liked to do
whatever her men wanted.</p>

<p>At thirty-two, Christabel Grau was a round and soft and
taffy-colored virgin with strands of gray. If Jinny Marshland was
like Cleo, a thin and restless and exciting young cat, Chris was
the serene tabby cuddled and humming on the hearth.</p>

<p>As they drove to her home, she speculated, with an unusual
irritation, "Didn't you think they were dull tonight?"</p>

<p>"I thought they talked about as usual."</p>

<p>"No, you didn't. For some reason, you were sizing them up
tonight, and that started me noticing that&mdash;Oh, they're all
darlings, and so smart&mdash;my, I bet there isn't a doctor at the
Mayos' that's as clever as Roy&mdash;but they always make the same
jokes, and they're so afraid of seeming sentimental. Roy wouldn't
ever admit how he loves his collection of Florida shells, and of
course Boone is as moony as a girl about his Beethoven records, and
Queenie says he'll sit by himself for hours listening to 'em, even
the hard quartets, and he's read all the lives of the composers,
but he pretends he just has the records to show off. We're all so
scared of getting out of the groove here, don't you think?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;yes," said Cass, who hadn't heard a word.</p>

<p>"But I do love Grand Republic so."</p>

<p>"Yes."<br>
<br></p>

<p>Chris lived on the top floor of her ancestral mansion on
Beltrami Avenue South, in the old part of town, in the valley. And
on that street Cass had been born. Forty years ago it had been the
citadel of the select residential district, where dwelt all that
was rich and seemly. Cass's present home, Bergheim, was aged, but
the other houses on Ottawa Heights had been built since 1900. These
new mansions did well in the matter of Mount Vernon pillars and
lumpy French-farmhouse towers, but they were plain as warehouses
compared with the Beltrami Avenue relics, which had an average of
twenty-two wooden gargoyles apiece, and one of which exhibited not
only a three-story tower but had a Tudor chimney running through
it.</p>

<p>Many of these shrines had been torn down to save taxes, and
others turned into a home for nuns, a home for pious Lutheran old
ladies, a business college, a Y.W.C.A. In seventy years, the
Belgravia of Grand Republic had been built and become an historic
ruin, and men whose own frail tissues had already lasted more than
eighty years, looking upon a granite castle now become a school for
the anxious daughters of improbable gentry, whispered in awe, "Why,
that house is old as the hills&mdash;almost seventy-five years
old!"</p>

<p>But Chris Grau, after her mother's death, had thriftily
remodeled their three-story-and-basement residence into seven
apartments, keeping the top floor for herself and renting the rest.
"Chris is an A 1 business-woman," said Roy Drover, and Roy would
know.</p>

<p>Cass was "just coming in for a second, for one drink," but he
felt relaxed, he felt at home, and wanted to linger in that room,
feminine yet firm, lilac-scented, with soft yellow walls and chairs
in blue linen, with many flowers and a Dutch-tile fireplace and all
the newest new books about psychology and Yugo-Slavian prime
ministers, many of which Chris had started to read.</p>

<p>She mixed a highball for him, without talking about it. She had
excellent Bourbon&mdash;she was a good and intelligent woman. She
sat on the arm of his chair, a chair that was just deep enough for
him; she smoothed his hair, without ruffling it, she kissed his
temple, without being moist, and she slipped away and sat casually
in her own chair before he had time to think about whether he had
any interest in caresses tonight.</p>

<p>"Yes, we were all awfully obvious, tonight," she meditated. "Why
didn't you bawl us out?"</p>

<p>"I'm not an uplifter, Chris. People are what they are. You learn
that in law-practice. I haven't the impertinence to tell old
friends how I think they ought to talk."</p>

<p>"You pretend to be nothing but scholarship and exactness, but
you're really all affection for the people you know."</p>

<p>"You'll be saying I'm a sentimentalist next, Chris."</p>

<p>"Well, aren't you? You even love cats."</p>

<p>"Hate 'em!"</p>

<p>&mdash;Why did I lie like that?</p>

<p>"Cassy, I&mdash;Oh, I'm sorry, <i>Cass!</i>"</p>

<p>&mdash;She even sees when I'm offended, without my having to rub
her nose in it. I could be very solid and comfortable if I married
her. She'd give warmth to that chilly old house. We belong
together; we're both Old Middlewest, informal but not rackety.
Let's see: Chris must be nine years younger than I am,
and&mdash;</p>

<p>She was talking on: "Speaking of uplift, I'll never give up
hoping that some day you'll be a United States Senator or on the
Supreme Court Bench. There isn't a man in the United States who has
more to give the public."</p>

<p>"No, no, Chris, that's sheer illusion. I'm simply a backwoods
lawyer. You know, any legal gent looks considerably larger and
brighter, up there on the bench."</p>

<p>"I won't have you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Besides, I feel lost in Washington. One brown rabbit doesn't
mean much in that menagerie of cassowaries."</p>

<p>"What <i>is</i> a cassowary?"</p>

<p>"Eh? Damned if I know. I think it's a bird."</p>

<p>"I'll look it up, right now."</p>

<p>"Not now. I really want to talk to you."</p>

<p>"Well, it's about time!"</p>

<p>They smiled, secretly and warmly. She seemed to him as intimate
and trusty as his own self when she went on:</p>

<p>"Maybe it was because Blanche was so ambitious that you disliked
Washington. An impossible wife for you!"</p>

<p>"I didn't dislike the place&mdash;people walking under the trees
in the evening, like a village. It's just that I have some kind of
an unformulated idea that I want to be identified with Grand
Republic&mdash; help in setting up a few stones in what may be a
new Athens. It's this northern country&mdash;you know, stark and
clean&mdash;and the brilliant lakes and the tremendous prairies to
the westward&mdash;it may be a new kind of land for a new kind of
people, and it's scarcely even started yet."</p>

<p>"Oh, I know!"</p>

<p>&mdash;She loves this place, too. She has roots, where Blanche
has nothing but aerial feelers. Hm. She's thirty-two. She could
still have half a dozen children. I'd like children around me, and
not just Mrs. Higbee and Cleo and a radio and a chessboard.</p>

<p>Chris came, not too impulsively, to kneel before him and clasp
both his hands, as she said trustingly:</p>

<p>"Of course you know best. The only reason why I'd like to see
you in the Senate is that Grand Republic would be so proud of you!"
Her eyes were all his, her voice was gentle, and her lips were not
far from his. "Though maybe that's silly, Cass, because I guess the
town couldn't be any prouder of you than it is already&mdash;no
prouder than I am, right now!"</p>

<p>There was a scent of apple-blossoms about her. He leaned
forward. Without moving, she seemed to be giving herself to him.
Her hand was at her soft bosom and her lips lifted.</p>

<p>Then, from far off, he heard the wailing of a frightened kitten,
gallant but hard-pressed.</p>

<p>Without willing it, he was on his feet, blurting good night,
hastening home to the small black absurdity of Cleo.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5</h2>

<p>His panic was gone before he had stepped like a soldier eight
blocks in that nipping northern air and begun to mount the Heights.
The streets were friendly with the fresh-leaved elms and maples for
which Grand Republic was notable; the cherries were in blossom, and
the white lilacs and mountain ash.</p>

<p>There were dark groves along the way, and alleys that rose
sharply and vanished around curves, there were gates in brick walls
and hedges; a quality by night which was odd and exciting to Cass
Timberlane, a life to be guessed at, not too plain. This was no
prairie town, flat and rectangular, with every virtue and crusted
sin exposed.</p>

<p>As he climbed, he could see the belated lights of farmhouses on
the uplands across the valley, the lights of buses down on Chippewa
Avenue, and in simplicity he loved his city now instead of fretting
that its typical evening conversation was dull&mdash;as dull as
that of Congressmen in the cloakroom or newspaper correspondents
over the poker table. But he fretted over himself and his perilous
single state, with nervousness about the fact that Chris Grau was
likely at any time to pick him up and marry him.</p>

<p>&mdash;No, I'll never marry again. I'd never be a good husband.
I'm too solemn&mdash;maybe too stuffy. I'm too devoted to the
law.</p>

<p>&mdash;Am I?</p>

<p>&mdash;I must get married. I can't carry on alone. Life is too
meaningless when you have no one for whom you want to buy gifts, or
steal them.</p>

<p>&mdash;If I did marry, I think that this time I could make a go
of it. I understand women a <i>little</i> better now. I shouldn't
have minded Blanche's love of tinsel, but just laughed at her. And
Chris thinks of other people. With her, I'd be happier and happier
as the years went by&mdash;</p>

<p>&mdash;Lord, that sounds so aged! It was her youth that I liked
so much in that girl on the witness-stand yesterday&mdash;or today,
was it? What was her name again&mdash;Virginia
something?...Curious. I can't see her any more!<br>
<br></p>

<p>In law-school, at the University of Minnesota, Cass had listened
to a lecture by that great advocate, Hugo Lebanon of Minneapolis,
had gone up glowingly to talk with him, and had been invited to
dinner at the Lebanon marble palace on Lake of the Isles. There was
a tall, pale, beautiful daughter named Blanche.</p>

<p>So Cass married the daughter.</p>

<p>She was emphatic about being a pure Anglo-Saxon who went right
back, even if Warwickshire remained curiously unstirred about her
going right back, to a gray stone house in Warwick. She was the
more vigorously pure about it because there were whispers of Jewish
blood. She found it hard to put up with the mongrel blood of the
furniture-dealing Timberlanes, and she was revolted when Cass
estimated that through his father, he was three-eighths British
stock, one-sixteenth French Canadian, and one-sixteenth Sioux
Indian&mdash;whence, he fondly believed, came his tall,
high-cheeked spareness&mdash;and through his mother he was
two-eighths Swedish, one-eighth German, one-eighth Norwegian.</p>

<p>Blanche did not, after the magnitude and salons of Minneapolis,
much like Grand Republic. When she came there as a bride, in 1928,
the Renoir had not yet arrived, so there was no one to talk to.</p>

<p>She encouraged Cass to run for Congress; she served rye, with
her own suave hands, to aldermen and county commissioners. Cass and
she attained Washington, and she loved it like a drunkard, and
loved the chance of meeting&mdash;at least of being in the same
populous rooms with&mdash;French diplomats and Massachusetts
senators and assorted Roosevelts. When Cass felt swamped, as a lone
representative among more than four hundred, when he longed for the
duck pass and his law-office and the roaring of Roy Drover, when he
refused to run for re-election, Blanche rebelled. She was not going
back to listen to Queenie Havock shrieking about her love-life, she
shouted, and Cass could not blame her, though he did sigh that
there were also other sounds audible in Grand Republic.</p>

<p>There was a mild, genial Englishman, Fox Boneyard, an importer
of textiles, who lived in New York but was often about Washington;
he had the unfortunate illusions about beautiful American women
that Englishmen sometimes do have, and he also had more money than
the Honorable Cass Timberlane.</p>

<p>Blanche married him.</p>

<p>During the divorce, Cass did have sense enough to refuse to pay
alimony to a woman who was marrying a richer man, and who had never
consented to having children. But he still loved Blanche enough to
hate her, and to hate convulsively the sight of a coat she had left
behind, and the wrinkles in it that had come from her strong
shoulders. He underwent the familiar leap from partisanship and
love to enmity and a sick feeling that he had been betrayed.</p>

<p>He grimly finished his last days in Congress, and then quite
dramatically went to pieces. He was a feeling man, and with a
whisky breath and unshaved, he was an interesting figure in
water-front cafes in Trinidad and Cartagena, and to his white cruel
love he paid the tribute of being sick in toilets and talking to
other saintly idiots about having lost his soul.</p>

<p>But even love for Blanche could not keep Cass Timberlane at this
romantic business for more than two months, and after another six,
most of them sedately spent in and about the Temple in London, he
returned to the affection of Grand Republic, and practised law for
three more years before he was elected to the bench.</p>

<p>Election was not easy. The routine politicians disliked him
because he had left Congress, because he could not be guided, and
because he made fun of all clauses in political speeches beginning
with "than whom." The churches, particularly the Lutherans, who
were powerful in Radisson County, disapproved of him because he had
been divorced. The Republicans were doubtful about him because he
had been amiable with Farmer-Labor leaders, and the
Farmer-Laborites distrusted him because he lived in a large house.
In fact, there was really no reason for his being elected except
that he was known to be honest, courageous, and learned, and that
he had once lent a grateful and active Norwegian farmer five
dollars.</p>

<p>But he was a judge now, and the district had the fixed habit of
him, and if he would only marry a sound churchwoman, like
Christabel Grau, and give a little more attention to the Chamber of
Commerce and to his bridge game, he might go on forever, a sound
and contented Leading Citizen.</p>

<h2>Chapter 6</h2>

<p>He was thinking of Chris Grau as he entered the long hallway of
Bergheim, lit only by a bogus-ancient pierced-brass lamp. Then
Cleo, the midnight-colored kitten, was galloping up to him, warming
his ankles, purring frantically, and with that ecstatic rhythm
there came back to him Jinny Marshland's name and the vision of her
face that he had lost: the surprising smallness of her face, the
absurd hawk nose, the jaunty hair hanging to her shoulders, the
bright curiosity in her eyes, her plunging youthful walk.</p>

<p>He lifted Cleo and thought how light Jinny would be to lift.
Cleo sat in his lap while he worked out a chess-problem for
nightcap; she moaned only a little when he played the flute for a
moment; and when he put her back into the box filled with clipped
paper that Mrs. Higbee had provided behind the kitchen stove, Cleo
made a business of curling round and sleeping, as a cat who
belonged there and liked it.</p>

<p>"A very sound kitten," Cass pronounced, and went comfortably up
to bed, pleasant in the thought that tomorrow the kitten would be
here, that some time this week he could most certainly see
Jinny.</p>

<p>He awoke rigid under the familiar torture which some dozen times
a year the mysterious Enemy inflicted upon him: the torture of
being bored by the too-frequent presence of his own self, bored to
cold emptiness by the inescapable and unchanging sight and sound of
Cass Timberlane, a man whom he usually respected, sometimes found
slightly funny, but of whose complaints and futile plans, round and
round in the mind, of whose demands for incessant attention, of
whose mirrored gawky face, of whose heavy voice, a murky cloud
forever in the air about him, he was sick to a state of fury. Could
he never get away from that man? Was he condemned forever to awaken
to the sight of that thick brown plowman's-hand on the blanket, to
the intrusiveness of that man's inevitable whining daydream: "I
will find my companion; I'll go on a journey somewhere and I'll
find her; I'll tell her about Grand Republic and she'll want to
come here, and we'll have a real family, with trust and serenity,
and I'll be a judge that&mdash;people will say, 'His court is the
model of fairness and mercy,' and she will be glad of it;
<i>she</i>&mdash;"</p>

<p>Oh, so that intrusive man was going to fall in love now, was he,
with his "Look at me! How exciting I am!" If he could only forget
the name and essence of Cass Timberlane and be blissfully
submerged, not in some rainbow-striped Oversoul but in the
tenderness of one other person.</p>

<p>Then he was sick of being sick of too-much-self, and with the
bright thought of Jinny he drove out his tired brooding upon his
brooding.</p>

<p>She actually did exist. He had seen her. In her was tolerant
friendship, and in her fresh cheeks and young bosom there was
promise of salvation by passion. With her he could escape into the
refuge of the Quiet Mind, away equally from the lonely Cass and
from a world of booming politics and oratory.</p>

<p>Was Jinny too young for him? Nonsense! He was only forty-one,
and stronger than any of these jazz-mad youngsters. And she would
make him still younger, along with her.</p>

<p>He went to sleep in dreams of a Jinny to whom, actually, he had
never said anything whatever except, "I think you'd better confine
yourself to answering the questions, without comment, Miss
Marshland."</p>

<p>There was nothing of the repining hermit in the Cass who leaped
up in the morning, greeted Cleo, who considered his toes very
funny, had a shower-bath and a scrupulous shave (telling himself,
as always, that the electric razor was a very fine Modern
Invention), greeted Mrs. Higbee, wolfed griddle cakes and sausages,
and tramped out upon the fresh May morning and the courts of
law.</p>

<p>George Hame, his court-reporter, greeted him filially, though
George was only three years younger, and filled his inkwell and his
water carafe and opened his mail.</p>

<p>The mail was of the usual: sixteen widows who had been cheated,
of whom seven sounded as though they ought to have been; and
sixteen organizations which desired the Judge to send in a little
contribution.</p>

<p>The other two judges of the district came in cordially: Judge
Stephen Douglas Blackstaff, the Old Roman, and Judge Conrad
Flaaten, who was Lutheran but gay. Judge Blackstaff wanted a
cigarette and Judge Flaaten wanted advice, and between them and the
mail and George Hame's admiration, Cass felt like his own man
again, resolute and happy in his workshop.</p>

<p>When he marched out into the court room and the bailiff pounded
his table and the nine persons present, besides the jury and the
officers of court, all made motions somewhat like rising in his
honor, then all the dread of too-much-self had gone out of Cass,
along with much of his excitement about a stray young woman named
Marshland, and he was again the tribal chieftain on his leather
throne.</p>

<p>The case of Miss Tilda Hatter vs. the City of Grand Republic was
concluded, and her many friends will be pleased to know that the
jury was out for only sixteen minutes and awarded her $200 out of
the $500 for which she had sued. Judge Timberlane reflected that
Miss Hatter was almost certain to put on a spread for Jinny and her
other boarders, with Bourbon, Coca-Cola, liverwurst, stuffed
olives, and chocolate layer cake.</p>

<p>He went for lunch not to the proper Federal Club, where bankers
and lawyers and grain-dealers sat around being high-class, but to
the Athletic Club, which admitted Jews and Unitarians. He hoped to
see Lucius Fliegend, the pasteboard-toy manufacturer, Jinny's
boss.</p>

<p>On his way he went along Chippewa Avenue and saw the humble
magnificence of the town's business center: the up-rearing
limestone and aluminum of the Blue Ox National Bank, the bookshop
that with a building of imitation half-timber tried to suggest the
romance and antiquity of England, the one complete department
store, Tarr's Emporium, with four vast floors crammed with
treasures from Burma and Minneapolis, and the Bozard Beaux Arts
Women's Specialty Shops, which everyone said was just as smart as
New York or Halle Brothers of Cleveland.</p>

<p>Among the bustling citizens who looked like everybody else on
every principal avenue from Bangor to Sacramento, there were
trout-fishermen in high boots and Finnish section-hands and Swedish
corn-planters from the prairie.</p>

<p>Grand Republic was metropolitan-looking in its black-glass and
green-marble shop fronts, its uniformed traffic policemen with Sam
Browne belts and pistol holsters, its florists' windows and La
Marquise French Candy Shop, but it was small enough so that he was
greeted&mdash;usually as "Judge," often as "Cass," occasionally as
"Jedge"&mdash;five times on every block, while the Policemen
touched their caps in salute. Grand Republic was small enough so
that a Mrs. George Hame had at least met a Mrs. Webb Wargate, and
ventured to say, in church lobby, "Well, how is your boy Jamie
doing in school, Mrs. Wargate?" It was small enough so that the
Judge could know how the whole city worked, but it was also small
enough so that Harley Bozard, coming out of his shop, already knew
that Cass had taken Chris Grau home last evening, and leered,
"What's this I hear you're going to drive into the matrimonial slew
again, Cass?"</p>

<p>It was all friendly; it restored his soul. He was too used to
them to note the hideousness of a black old stone hotel with
massive portals and torn lace curtains, and the car-parking lots
that were like sores on the wholesome limbs of the streets, or to
reflect that the only design for planning the city had always been
the dollar-sign. What of that, when he could be greeted "H' are
you, old boy!" by Frank Brightwing, the real-estate man, who was
melodiously drunk on every Saturday evening and on every Sunday
morning, at the Baptist Church, was as unaffectedly pious and
hopeful as the cherubs he so much resembled.</p>

<p>The moment Cass was inside the railroad-station noisiness of the
Athletic Club, he hunted up Lucius Fliegend, a gentle person with a
thin beard, who might have been a professor of Greek.</p>

<p>He confessed, "Lucius, I'm ashamed that I haven't been around
here lately, looking for a game of chess."</p>

<p>"You young fellows, you politicians, don't appreciate chess. In
the good old days here, the lumbermen and the gamblers in
iron-leases used to go out and steal a million dollars and come
home and drink a quart of red-eye and sit down to six hours of
chess. Now, they steal only a thousand, and then play bridge and
drink gin, a lady's drink. Will you choose your pawn?"</p>

<p>After the game (which Lucius won), Cass spoke abruptly, for this
was an honest and understanding man. "Yesterday in court I saw a
young lady who says she works for you. Miss Marshland. I'd like to
really meet her."</p>

<p>"Jinny is a lovely girl. Erica and I are fond of her. She is
ambitious, but not in the sharp, bitter way of so many of these
young career women. She's quite a good draftsman. She has a nice
fantastic taste&mdash;she does some very funny pasteboard dolls for
me. And she's beautiful, but she's also a frail, over-engined girl
who will either burn herself out or fall in love with some
appealing scamp who'll break her heart, unless some solid man traps
her first."</p>

<p>"But would she <i>like</i> a solid man?"</p>

<p>"I doubt it. And, though he'd find it interesting, I don't know
how much he'd enjoy nursing a young black panther."</p>

<p>"She's probably already engaged."</p>

<p>"I don't think so; merely has a lot of young men friends. But
with all her fire, she's domestic. Her father is a druggist up here
in Pioneer Falls, a pleasant fellow. He taught Jinny her Latin at
the age of ten. Of course she forgot it at the age of twelve. She's
a good girl and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"When will you invite us to dinner together?"</p>

<p>"Some time soon."</p>

<p>"No! Much sooner than that!"</p>

<p>"Very well. Next Saturday evening, provided Jinny isn't out
canoeing with some handsome young man."</p>

<p>"Excellent!"</p>

<p>He was thinking of that "handsome young man" and astonished to
find in himself a jealousy not coy but bitter and real. He hated
jealousy and all its rotten fruits, as he had seen them in court,
hated that sour suspiciousness which ferments in love, yet over a
girl to whom he had once said just fourteen words, he was mildly
homicidal toward an imaginary young man.</p>

<p>"I seem to be falling in love," he thought profoundly.</p>

<h2>Chapter 7</h2>

<p>Cass was disappointed when Mrs. Fliegend telephoned to him not
to dress for dinner. He would have liked to show Jinny how stately
he could be. But she reported that Jinny was "so thrilled to meet
you; she thinks you were wonderful on the bench&mdash;so
wise&mdash;and of course Lucius and I do, too, Judge."</p>

<p>He stroked Cleo, and sounded like her.</p>

<p>After pondering on precedents, he decided that it was far enough
on in the spring for him to wear his white-flannel suit, with the
tie from Marshall Field's. While he put these on, gravely, as
though he were studying a brief, he wondered how much he was going
to like Jinny. So far, he merely loved her.</p>

<p>Would she be one of these Professional Youths? Would she reek
with gum and with the slang suitable to it: "Oh boy!" and "No soap"
and "That's what you think"?</p>

<p>"Oh, quit it!" he said, aloud&mdash;and Cleo promised that she
would.</p>

<p>He was so elegant tonight that he drove to the Fliegends',
instead of walking.</p>

<p>The Fliegends' bulky old brown house was on South Beltrami, a
block from Chris Grau's.</p>

<p>He felt guilty of disloyalty to Chris in loving young Jinny, but
he felt even wickeder as he reflected that though he had been born
only three blocks from the Fliegends', he had not been in their
house since boyhood, and could not remember its rooms. Probably
Chris and Bradd Criley and Boone Havock had never been inside it.
In "The Friendly City," as we call it, we don't shoot Jews and
Catholics and Socialists and saints. We just don't go calling on
them.</p>

<p>Then Mrs. Fliegend was beaming on him at the door, while he
imagined her saying, "You phony politician! You've never
condescended to come to our house till you wanted us to play
procurers for you. You, the great Anglo-Saxon judge and
gentleman&mdash; you Sioux bastard! Get out!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Fliegend must have wondered why Judge Timberlane seemed so
pleased by her mild greeting.</p>

<p>Looking past his hosts into the square living-room which made up
half the first floor, he saw no Jinny, but only a great blankness
where she should have been.</p>

<p>&mdash;Maybe she isn't coming? Ditched me for that young man in
the canoe?</p>

<p>Mrs. Fliegend was soothing him, "Oh, she'll be here, Judge!"</p>

<p>&mdash;Is my youthful romance as obvious as all that?</p>

<p>Remembering it only from childhood, he had expected the interior
of the Fliegend house to be Oriental and over-rich. But it was the
elder German and Yankee pioneers who had satin-brocaded walls and
Tudor fireplaces. Here, the walls were of white paneled wood,
dotted with old maps of Minnesota and portraits of its early
heroes: Ramsey, Sibley, Steele, Pike, Taliaferro.</p>

<p>"I didn't know you were such a collector of Minnesota items,"
said Cass.</p>

<p>&mdash;That sounded fatuous and condescending. I didn't mean to
be.</p>

<p>Lucius explained, "I was born in Minnesota, in Long Prairie, and
my father before me, near Marine Mills, where my grandfather
settled. He fought through the Civil War, in the Third Minnesota.
We are of the old generation."</p>

<p>Cass was meditating upon his rare gifts of ignorance when Jinny
Marshland flew into the room.</p>

<p>She was no wild little hawk now, but a young lady. Her hair was
put up, sleek and tamed, and she wore a dress of soft black with,
at her pleated black girdle, one silver rose. She was quick-moving
and friendly, and her greeting was almost excessive: "I'm terrified
to meet you, Judge, after seeing you in court. I thought you were
going to send me to Stillwater for contempt. You won't now, will
you?"</p>

<p>Yet no spark came to him from her, and she was just another
pretty girl, another reed bending to the universal south wind.</p>

<p>The other guests, a couple who came in with shy bumptiousness,
made him feel as guilty at his neglect of them as had the
Fliegends. They were Dr. Silbersee, refugee Jewish eye-ear-throat
specialist from Vienna, 'cellist in the amateur double-quartet that
was Grand Republic's only musical wonder, and his wife Helma, who
was equally serious about the piano, Apfelkuchen, and the doctrines
of the post-Freudian psychoanalysts.</p>

<p>Cass had been fretting all week, after his session with Chris
Grau, that the local conversation was dull. He had wished, for the
benefit of his unconscious protegee Jinny, to exhibit what he
conceived to be a real European conversazione, complete with Rhine
wine and seltzer. He got it, too, this evening, and he didn't care
much for it. He realized again, as he had in Washington and in
waterfront dives in Trinidad, that most conversation is dull. Aside
from shop-talk, which includes the whispering of lovers, anything
printed, a time-table or the rich prose of a tomato-catsup label,
is more stimulating than any talk, even the screaming of six
economists and an intellectual actress.</p>

<p>At dinner, the Fliegends and the Silbersees said that this
fellow Hitler was no good, that it had been warm today, that it
might be warmer tomorrow, that Toscanini was a good conductor, that
rents in Grand Republic were very high just now, and that there was
a Little Armenian Restaurant in Milwaukee.</p>

<p>It was, in perfection, New York, minus the taxi horns, and still
Cass was not satisfied, and, so far as he could see, neither was
Jinny.</p>

<p>At first, as the conversation took fire, she hadn't so much as a
chip to throw into it. She sat mute, with her hands folded small
and flat and meek, and she had no observations on the subject of
Debussy, regarding which Lucius had represented her as highly
eloquent. Cass decided that she was stupid, and that there wasn't
much to be said for himself either.</p>

<p>But he noticed how quickly her dark eyes turned from speaker to
speaker; how she weighed, and did not think very much of, her
ponderous elders. Slowly he was hypnotized by her again; he felt
her independence and her impatience to do things. Restless under
this middle-aged droning, he wanted to be on her side. And he was a
little afraid of her.</p>

<p>But he made a good deal of progress in his romance. To his
original fourteen words of address to her, he had now added
sixty-seven others, including, "No, no, you weren't late. I think I
was ahead of time. I guess my watch is fast." No flowery squire
could have said it more colorfully.</p>

<p>The Fliegends were lenient hosts, and after dinner (roast goose
and potato pancakes, such heavenly stuff as Grand Republic rarely
knew), they wedged the Silbersees in beside the grand piano, and
sent Cass and Jinny "out to see the garden."</p>

<p>Like most houses in Grand Republic, where the first settlers
huddled together instead of taking ten acres for each garden, the
Fliegend abode was too close to its neighbors. But they had planted
cedar hedges, and made a pool surrounded with wicker benches that
were, surprisingly, meant to be sat upon. Cass and Jinny did sit
upon them, and he did not in the least feel that he was sitting
upon a pink cloud. He was anxious to find out, while still posing
as a big superior man, whether Jinny considered him a stuffy old
party.</p>

<p>"Nice dinner," he said.</p>

<p>"Wasn't it?"</p>

<p>"This, uh, this Roy Harris they were talking about&mdash;do you
know his music?"</p>

<p>"Just a little."</p>

<p>"Uh&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I've just heard some of it played."</p>

<p>"Yes, uh&mdash;I guess&mdash;I guess Dr. Silbersee is a very
fine musician."</p>

<p>"Yes, isn't he."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You've heard him play, Judge?"</p>

<p>"Yes, uh&mdash;oh yes, I've heard him play. A very fine
'cellist."</p>

<p>"Of course I don't know music well enough to tell, but I think
he must be and&mdash;"</p>

<p>Then it broke:</p>

<p>"Jinny! Were you bored tonight?"</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"Our pompous talk."</p>

<p>"Why, I thought it was lovely talk. I was so interested about
the conductors: Mitropoulos and Bruno Walter."</p>

<p>"Oh. You like musicians?"</p>

<p>"Love 'em. If I really knew any. But one thing did bother
me."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"I thought <i>you</i> were bored. I was watching you,
Judge."</p>

<p>"And I was watching you."</p>

<p>"Two kids among the grown-ups!"</p>

<p>They both laughed very much, and he was grateful for being
included in her conspiracy of youth.</p>

<p>The silent Jinny talked enough now. "I thought they were all so
nice, and oh boy! are they ever learned! I guess the people in
Vienna must be like them. But I wanted to hear <i>you</i>
talk."</p>

<p>"Why?" It was too flagrant even to be called "fishing."</p>

<p>"I wanted to know how do criminals get that way, and can you
help them, and&mdash;I'll bet they're awed by you."</p>

<p>"Not much."</p>

<p>"I would be. I was sort of disappointed by the court room,
though. I thought there'd be a whole mob, holding their breaths,
and sixteen reporters writing like mad, but they were&mdash;oh, as
if they were waiting for a bus. But then when I looked at
you&mdash;honestly, you scared me, Judge!"</p>

<p>"Now, now!"</p>

<p>"You <i>did!</i>"</p>

<p>"How could I? Judge Blackstaff might, but I'm just a hometown
lawyer."</p>

<p>"You are not a home-town lawyer! Oh, I mean you are, of course,
but I mean&mdash;you aren't <i>any</i> home-town lawyer!" She
sounded proud of him, and eager. "On the bench, you looked as if
you knew everything, and maybe you might be kind of sorry for me,
for having murdered my Aunt Aggie and stolen the sewing-machine
oil-can, but you'd put me away for ten years, for the good of
society. Wouldn't you?"</p>

<p>"No, I'm afraid I'd resign from the bench first, Jinny."</p>

<p>"M!" She sounded gratified, and with some energy he kept himself
from seizing her hand. It was fated that he should now take the
next step, with "You came by bus, didn't you? May I drive you
home?"</p>

<p>He, it seemed, might.</p>

<p>He said good night to the Fliegends and Silbersees with a
feeling of having enlarged his knowledge of Grand Republic. When
Jinny was beside him in his car, the major purposes of his life
seemed to have been accomplished, even if he could express the
ultimate glory only by a hesitating, "It was a very pleasant
evening, didn't you think?"</p>

<h2>Chapter 8</h2>

<p>The boarding-house of Miss Tilda Hatter was the hobohemia of
Grand Republic. It occupied the two upper floors of a senile brick
building near Paul Bunyan Avenue, in a land of railroad sidings and
six-man factories. On the ground floor of the building was the
Lilac Lady Lunchroom: T. Hatter, Prop., at whose counter and four
tousled tables eternal and poetic Youth could drink coffee and eat
blueberry pie a la mode, with ice cream disgustingly but sweetly
melting down into the blue-smeared debris, and talk about the high
probability of their going to Minneapolis and singing on the radio,
or going to Chicago and studying interior decorating.</p>

<p>Above the restaurant were a dozen bedrooms, with one bath, and a
living-room agreeably littered with skis, skates, unstrung tennis
rackets, stenographers' note-books, manuals on air-conditioning and
gas-engine construction, burnt-out portable radio sets, empty
powder compacts, empty gin bottles, and the Poetic Works of John
Donne, with the covers missing. These upper rooms were reached by a
covered wooden outside staircase.</p>

<p>The building had once been a dry-goods store and once the
offices of a co-operative farmers' insurance company, and once a
butcher-shop with a fancy-house above it, in which two young ladies
had murdered the melancholy butcher. But now it was all orderly as
a Y.W.C.A., and rather like it in the excessive amount of
cigarette-smoking.</p>

<p>As Cass and Jinny drove up to it, she insisted, "You must come
up a minute and say hello to Miss Hatter. She's convinced the jury
gave her all that money only because you told them to, and she's
one person that really worships you."</p>

<p>"Meaning that somebody else doesn't?"</p>

<p>His wheedling tone, the distractedness with which he turned his
face toward her and so ran the car up on the curb as he was
parking, were not to be distinguished from the large idiocies of
any other injudicious young lover. She answered only, "You'd be
surprised! Come, it's one flight up."</p>

<p>He had a daring hope that this girl, so desirable, with her
bright face and young breast, did see him as the great man
scattering nobility from the high throne of the bench. He knew that
he wasn't anything of the kind, but merely a business umpire in a
dusty hall. Yet if she could have such faith in him, she might lift
him to whatever greatness she imagined in him. With solemnity and
love he followed her up the flat-sounding steps and into the
boarding-house salon.</p>

<p>Miss Hatter was mixing a heady beverage of gin, Coca-Cola, creme
de rose, and tea, standing at a sloppy pine table, while four young
people sat near her on the floor&mdash;not because there were no
chairs but because they were at the age and intellectual claimancy
when one does sit on the floor.</p>

<p>Miss Hatter screamed, "Oh, Judge!" As though he were a bishop or
a movie star. "Jinny said she'd try to get you to drop in, but I
never dreamed she <i>would!</i>"</p>

<p>&mdash;So this young woman had planned to have me drive her
home. Am I gratified or do I feel let down? Anyway, she looks so
charming, in fact, well, so aristocratic in her little black dress
and that one silver rose, among these hit-or-a-miss yearners
here.</p>

<p>Miss Hatter was going on: "Folks, this is Judge Timberlane. My,
this is an honor. I'll say it is!"</p>

<p>Jinny introduced her four companions of the arts as they sulkily
rose and dusted their knees. They were not too
young&mdash;twenty-four to thirty&mdash;but the placid disregard of
them by Grand Republic still kept them youthful and belligerent.
They were Lyra Coggs, assistant city librarian, Wilma Gunton, head
of the cosmetics department at Tarr's Emporium, Tracy Oleson,
secretary to powerful Webb Wargate and a young man who seemed to
Cass interesting enough to be looked at with suspicion, Eino
Roskinen, aged twenty-four, butter-maker at the Northward
Co-operative Dairy but, as Jinny explained, a born theater
director.</p>

<p>Eino was a darkly serious young Finn; he looked at Jinny with
what Cass nervously saw to be the greatest fondness and at Cass
with the greatest dislike, so that Cass felt like an old windbag,
though he had as yet said nothing more than, "Well! Good
evening."</p>

<p>&mdash;So the struggle for her has started already. And I'm not
going to give her up even to you, my Byronic young friend.</p>

<p>He was certain that Eino was an evil whelp, who meant no good to
Jinny. He sat on a chair, near Miss Hatter, the only other person
of his age and uncomfortable dignity, while all five of the young
people were on the floor, chattering&mdash;especially the Jinny who
had been so silent at the Fliegends':</p>

<p>"You know, Judge, we think we have an intellectual center here.
Oh, we're tremendous. Wilma is going to New York to start a
cosmetics company there&mdash;green lip-sticks&mdash;as soon as she
can save enough money to ride there in a box-car. But our star is
Eino. He has Theories. He says that the new America isn't made up
of British stock and Irish and Scotch, but of the Italians and
Poles and Icelanders and Finns and Hungarians and Slovaks. People
like you and me are the Red Indians of the country. We'll either
pass out entirely or get put on reservations, where we can do our
Yankee tribal dances and wear our native evening clothes
undisturbed. Isn't that the idea, Eino?"</p>

<p>"Not entirely, Jinx. We may allow full citizenship to some of
the Yankee tribesmen, if they learn the principles of cooperation
and give up their medicine-men&mdash;pastors they call 'em, I
believe. But judges, now&mdash;I don't know about them. They're too
corrupted by the native voodoo. I don't know whether they can learn
to speak the American language."</p>

<p>"Don't you dare to say anything against Judge Timberlane!"
screamed Miss Hatter, and wondered why they all laughed at her,
though Cass's contributory laughter was on the pale side.</p>

<p>He was deciding, with a thrill of reality, that he hated
Eino.</p>

<p>&mdash;That fatuous young pup! Daring to call her "Jinx." Or
even "Jinny," for that matter. "Miss Virginia" is good enough for
you, my friend. You and your Hunkies! Just try bucking us Yankees!
By&mdash;the&mdash;way, my friend, do you happen to know that I'm
scarcely Yankee at all, that I'm part Scandinavian and part Sioux?
Of course you don't! And it makes me sick, when I wonder whether
this Eino has ever dared to put his arms around Jinny or kiss her
lips. Sick!</p>

<p>All the while he knew that he did not mean any of it, that Eino
was probably an excellent fellow.</p>

<p>&mdash;Funny. I never was jealous like this about Blanche.
Wonder where she is now. I'll bet she's keeping that poor English
husband of hers busy digging out viscounts for her!<br>
<br></p>

<p>Miss Hatter, addressing him constantly as "Your Honor," was
explaining the wonderful things she was going to do with her
litigious $200, including false teeth for an aged cousin resident
in Beloochistan, Minnesota. Tracy Oleson talked about canoe trips
in the Crane Lake country. Jinny alleged that Dr. Silbersee had
once absently tried to remove tonsils from his 'cello. But Eino was
scornful and still.</p>

<p>Cass was a friendly villager, and accustomed to friendliness
from others. Even the forger whom he condemned to the state
Penitentiary seemed to feel that it was all very reasonable, and
Cass was dismayed now to feel hostility in the Eino to whom he was
entirely hostile! Suddenly Cass wanted to run off to the security
of slippers and Cleo and a chess-problem. In a wondrously nervous
state, between humble haughtiness and haughty humbleness before a
dramaturgic butter-maker, he tacked successfully for an hour, and
he was rewarded, when he said that it was time to go, by Jinny's
coming down the outside staircase with him.</p>

<p>The step at the foot of the stairs was no romantic site; it was
a scuffed and scabby plank which creaked. In the small yard
outside, an old hen of a maple tree perched amid patchy short
grass, and the rusty old iron fence smelled of rusty old iron.
Across the street, a man in a lighted upper window stood scratching
himself.</p>

<p>But she was in the half-darkness with him; he saw her throat
above the soft black dress, he caught the scent of her hair, surely
a different scent from any other in the world. She was herself
different from anyone else, a complete individual, courageous and
joyful and yet so fragile that she must be protected. He held her
hand, and quaked with the feeling of it. There was no doubt now, he
decided, that he was utterly in love with her, that her small dim
presence was a vast blazing temple. She was not something that he
had imagined in his loneliness. She was life.</p>

<p>He stumbled, "Look, Jinny. Have you ever been to the Unstable
for dinner?"</p>

<p>"Just once."</p>

<p>"Like it?"</p>

<p>"It's fun."</p>

<p>"Will you dine with me there, next Tuesday or Wednesday?"</p>

<p>"I'd be glad to&mdash;say Tuesday."</p>

<p>The fact that she had chosen the earlier day was enough to send
him home singing "Mandalay," with much feeling and no tune.</p>

<p>After one in the morning, he sat in his leather chair and Cleo
sat on the hearth. He was posing for himself a legal question: Was
he trying to seduce Jinny?</p>

<p>That would be extremely agreeable, if it could be accomplished,
and not much more criminal than setting fire to a children's
hospital. Reputable men did do it. It was obvious, he thought, that
she was a little too young and too spirited to marry him, and even
if she would accept him, would it not be a wickedness to introduce
her in that dullest of all sets in Grand Republic, to which, by
habit, he belonged? He had seen girls, lively and defiant, marry
householders on Ottawa Heights, and within ten years become faintly
wrinkled at the neck, and given to stating as rigidly as their own
horrid grandmothers that all servants are thankless brutes.</p>

<p>And how well did Jinny understand him? Would she be able to
endure it if he took off the grave judicial manner which he wore
for protection, and betrayed himself as a Midwestern Don Quixote,
one-sixteenth Sioux and one-sixteenth poet: a bridge-player who
thought that bridge was dull, a Careful Investor who sympathized
with hoboes, a calm and settled householder who envied Thoreau his
cabin and Villon his wild girls?</p>

<p>"I ought to marry some woman who likes what I'm trying to do.
Though I suppose I ought to find out first just what I am trying to
do!"</p>

<p>He ended his brooding with a cry that made Cleo leap protesting
into the air:</p>

<p>"I do love that girl so!"</p>

<h2>Chapter 9</h2>

<p>The Unstable had been a stable and it had been a speakeasy and
now it was the local Pre-Catelan, nine miles out of town, on the
bank of the Big Eagle River, facing the rugged bluffs. The interior
was in bright green, with chairs of polished steel and crimson
composition tables decorated with aluminum blossoms, in
semi-circular booths, and it had an orchestra of piano, saxophone,
violin, and drum. By day, piano was a dry-goods clerk, saxophone
was a Wargate warehouse-hand, violin was a lady hair-dresser, and
drum was asleep. Its food was the standard Steak &amp; Chicken, but
its whisky was excellent. Its most pious contribution to living was
that in this land where autumn too often trips on the heels of
spring and, except on picnics, people dine inside, it did have
outdoor tables, not of composition but of honest, old-fashioned,
beer-stained pine.</p>

<p>At such a table, in a grape-arbor, Cass and Jinny had dined
slowly, looking at each other oftener than at the crisp chicken,
the fresh radishes. They had talked of their childhoods, and they
seemed united by fate when they found that he had, as a boy, hunted
prairie chickens in the vast round of wheat stubble just beyond her
native village of Pioneer Falls.</p>

<p>He urged, "You know what I'd like most to do, besides learning a
little law and maybe having a farm way up in the hills above the
Sorshay Valley? I'd like to paddle a canoe, or at least my half of
the canoe, from New York City to Hudson's Bay, by way of the Hudson
and the Great Lakes and the old fur-trappers' trail at Grand
Portage, up here on Lake Superior. It would take maybe six months,
camping out all that time. Wouldn't that be exciting?"</p>

<p>"Ye-es."</p>

<p>"Do you think you'd like to go along?"</p>

<p>"I don't know&mdash;I'm afraid I've never planned anything like
that."</p>

<p>"You can come in imagination, can't you?"</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;maybe. Provided we could go to New Orleans&mdash;in
imagination!&mdash; to rest up afterward, and live in the French
Quarter in a flat with an iron balcony, and eat gumbo. Could we do
that?"</p>

<p>"Why not!"</p>

<p>They saw that they need not all their lives stick to courts and
factories and city streets, but actually do such pleasant,
extravagant things...if they shaped life together.</p>

<p>He cried, "Approval from the higher court! Look!"</p>

<p>The moon had come out from a black-hearted, brazen-edged cloud,
to illuminate the wide barley-fields on the uplands across the
river, with one small yellow light in a farmhouse, and the
fantastically carved and poplar-robed bluffs of the Big Eagle. Wild
roses gave their dusty scent, and inside the rackety roadhouse, the
jukebox softly played Jerome Kern. It was everything that was most
Christmas-calendar and banal: June, moon, roses, song, a man and a
girl; banal as birth and death and war, banal and eternal; the
Perfect Moment which a man knows but a score of times in his whole
life. All respectable-citizen thoughts about whether they should be
married, and should they keep the maple bedstead in the gray room,
were burned out of him, and he loved the maid as simply and
fiercely as any warrior. He ceased to be just Cass Timberlane; he
was a flame-winged seraph guarding the gentle angel. They floated
together in beauty. They were not doing anything so common as to
hold hands; it was their spirits that reached and clung, made
glorious by the moment that would die.</p>

<p>When the moon was gone under a marbled cloud and the music
ceased and there was only silence and lingering awe, she whispered,
so low that he was not quite sure that she had said it, "That
frightened me! It was too beautiful. 'On such a night&mdash;' Oh,
Cass!"</p>

<p>She was chatty and audible enough afterward, and she carefully
called him "Judge," but he knew that they were intimates.</p>

<p>As they drove home she prattled, "Judge, I have an important
message. Tilda Hatter wants to give a party for you at the
boarding-house&mdash;all of us do, of course."</p>

<p>"Except Eino, who objects?"</p>

<p>She giggled. "But don't you think his objection is flattering?
I've only heard him object before to Henry James and Germany and
stamp-collecting...You will come? You'll love Lyra Coggs."</p>

<p>"I'm sure I will. She's a great girl...What are you snickering
at?"</p>

<p>"You do try so hard not to be the judge, tolerating us noisy
brats!"</p>

<p>"I swear that's not so. Surely you're onto me by now. More than
anything else, I'm still the earnest schoolboy that wants to learn
everything. And there's so much you can teach me. I certainly don't
regard myself as aged, at only forty-one, but still
<i>you</i>&mdash;you were born the year of the Russian revolution,
you've always known airplanes and the radio. I want to understand
them as you do."</p>

<p>"And the things _I_ want to learn! Biology and hockey and
Swedish!"</p>

<p>"How about anthropology and crop-rotation?"</p>

<p>"Okay. And fencing and flower-arrangement and gin-rummy and
Buddhism."</p>

<p>"Do most of the kids at Miss Hatter's want to learn anything?
They sound smug to me."</p>

<p>"They are not! If you knew how we talk when we're alone! Oh,
maybe too much slang and cursing and talk about sex."</p>

<p>He winced. He did not care for the picture of Eino Roskinen
"talking about sex" with a helpless Jinny...if she was
helpless.</p>

<p>"But that's because we're sick of the pompous way that all you
older people go on, over and over, about politics and affairs in
Europe and how you think we drink too much."</p>

<p>"Well, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Maybe. But <i>we</i> know how to handle <i>our</i> liquor."</p>

<p>"I doubt it."</p>

<p>"So do I!" She laughed, and he was in love with her again, after
a measureless five seconds during which he had detested her for the
egotism of youth. She piped on, "But I do think we're a terribly
honest lot."</p>

<p>"You don't think I'm the kind of politician that hates
honesty?"</p>

<p>She said her "Oh, you're different," and the good man found the
wisdom to stop talking and to feel the magic of having her there
cozily beside him: her smooth arms, her hands folded in her lap,
her thin corn-yellow dress and the small waist belted with
glittering jet whose coolness his hand wanted to follow. She was
there with him, this girl who was different from any female since
Eve, and he was thus sanctified...And did it really matter when she
unfolded the fairy hands and smoked her seventh cigarette that
evening?</p>

<p>Didn't the vestal Chris smoke too much?</p>

<p>The intrusion of Chris worried him. She had no hold on him
but&mdash; well&mdash;if Chris saw him driving with this girl,
there would be trouble.</p>

<p>&mdash;Why should there be trouble? I'm independent of her and
of everybody else&mdash;well, maybe not of Jinny.</p>

<p>He said aloud, "What about your drafting at Fliegends'? I
suppose you want to go study in Paris, and become a famous
artist."</p>

<p>"No, I have no real ideas. I'm just a fair workman, at best.
I'll never have what they call a 'career.'"</p>

<p>He was so little Feminist as to be pleased.</p>

<p>As they drove up to Miss Hatter's he wound up all the tinsel of
his thoughts in one bright ball and tossed it to her: "I certainly
have enjoyed this evening!"</p>

<p>She answered with equal poesy, "So have I!"</p>

<p>He tentatively kissed her hand. She could not have noticed it,
for she said only, "You'll come to our party, week from Thursday,
then?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sweet. Good night."</p>

<h2>Chapter 10</h2>

<p>The surprising objects that you see when you leave your own
Grand Republic and go traveling&mdash;pink snakes and polar
bears&mdash;are nothing beside what you find when you stay at home
and have a new girl and meet her friends, whose resentment of you
is only less than your amazement that there are such people and
that she likes them.</p>

<p>At Tilda Hatter's party, Cass was first uncomfortable because he
was the only Elder Statesman present and the young people showed
their independence by unduly ignoring him. Then the gods presiding
over that form of torture called social gatherings switched to the
opposite ordeal, and he found himself the rival of another
celebrity, of whom, just to be difficult, the bright young people
did make much.</p>

<p>Besides the boarders, Jinny, Eino, Tracy Oleson, and the
efficient Miss Gunton and Miss Coggs, there were present a couple
of schoolteachers, the leftist county agricultural agent, and a
young Norwegian-American grain expert who had once run for the
Legislature. They sat tremendously upon the floor and talked, and
all of them, including Jinny, to Cass's delicate distress, had
Bourbon highballs.</p>

<p>Their talk was tempestuous. They said that America should join
Great Britain in its war against Germany, but that many of the Rich
Guys on Ottawa Heights were Isolationists. They said that it was
okay&mdash;that was how they put it&mdash;for a man and a woman to
live together without clerical license. Cass was shocked when he
heard the pure young novice, Jinny, chirping, "Old people today are
just as afraid of Sex as their grandfathers were."</p>

<p>They all looked at Cass, but forbiddingly did not ask him what
he thought. Eino Roskinen, squatted beside Jinny, drew her toward
him, and she leaned with her back against his shoulder, and Cass
violently did not notice.</p>

<p>He did not understand their family words and jokes. One of them
had only to say "Hail the Hippopotamus!" for the whole tribe to
guffaw. He was not too old for them&mdash;he was perhaps eight
years older than Wilma or Tracy&mdash;but he felt too bookish, too
responsible, too closely shaved, too alone.</p>

<p>He had become used to his de facto banishment when Lucius and
Erica Fliegend and Sweeney Fishberg came in.</p>

<p>Sweeney Fishberg was perhaps the most remarkable man in the
cosmos of Grand Republic and surrounding terrain.</p>

<p>He was an attorney, of liberal tastes, equally likely to take a
labor-union case for nothing or to take the most fraudulent of
damage suits for a contingent fee which, to the fury of his Yankee
wife, he was likely to give to a fund for strikers&mdash;any
strikers on any strike. He was a saint and a shyster; part Jewish
and part Irish and part German; he had once acted in a summer stock
company, and once taught Greek in a West Virginia college; he was a
Roman Catholic, and a mystic who bothered his priest with
metaphysical questions; he was in open sympathy with the Communist
Party.</p>

<p>For twenty years, ever since he had come to Grand Republic from
his natal Massachusetts at the age of thirty, he had been fighting
all that was rich and proud and puffy in the town, and he had never
won a single fight nor lost his joy in any of them, and he was
red-headed and looked like a Cockney comedian. He was nine years
older than Cass, and no lawyer in the district ever brought such
doubtful suits into court, yet no lawyer was more decorous, more
co-operative with the judge, and Cass believed that Sweeney had
thrown to him all the votes he could influence in Cass's elections
as congressman, judge, and member of the Aurora Borealis Bock Beer
and Literary Association.</p>

<p>It was Sweeney Fishberg who was Cass's rival as celebrity of the
evening and who led the hazing.</p>

<p>Pretending not to know that Cass had even heard of them, Sweeney
and the Fliegends and Tracy Oleson and the county agent agreed that
Dr. Roy Drover was a butcher, that Bradd Criley was a Fascist, and
that the Reverend Dr. Lloyd Garrison Gadd, Cass's distant cousin
and his pastor, was a "phony liberal" who loved the wage-workers
but underpaid his cook. It was clear to Cass that he was being
drawn, but whenever he wanted to be angry, he remembered that this
was the malice with which Roy and Bradd talked of Sweeney Fishberg
and would have talked of Mr. Fliegend had they ever considered him
important enough to mention. With prayer and resolution, Cass got
through his hazing, and all of them began to look at him in a fond
and neighborly way&mdash;all but Eino. Not Eino, ever.</p>

<p>On the ground of helping mix the highballs, Cass followed Jinny
to the kitchen, a coop shocking with dirty dishes. He spoke
savagely. "Did you plan to have all those Robespierres gang up on
me?"</p>

<p>"Not really. And they've often ganged up on me, for what they
think is my innocence."</p>

<p>"Are you in love with that Roskinen? Now, please, I don't mean
to sound rude, but I must know. Are you engaged to him or
anything?"</p>

<p>"Not anything."</p>

<p>"Are you engaged to anybody?" His arm circled her shoulder.</p>

<p>"Not just now. Don't, Cass. You're choking me."</p>

<p>"I almost could choke you when you let that Roskinen&mdash;Oh, I
suppose he's a decent-enough boy, but I'm furious when you let him
maul you, put his hand on your breast."</p>

<p>She flared, as if she hated him, "You have a vile mind!" But
when he jerked back like a slapped five-year-old, she softened.
"Honestly, darling, it doesn't mean a thing, with a colt like Eino,
but if you want me to act like a lady, I'll try, and how I dread
it!"</p>

<p>He kissed her, long and seriously, surprised by the soft
fleshiness of her lips. She squeezed away from him with an
embarrassed "Well!" and fled from him, carrying back into the
living-room the still-unwashed glasses she had brought with her. As
Cass leaned against the untidy sink, overwhelmed, feeling guilty
but assuring himself that she had responded to his kiss, Eino
Roskinen came in, glaring.</p>

<p>"Now this is going to be melodrama," Cass thought
protestingly.</p>

<p>Eino was in his uniform as a young radical: dark jacket, soft
shirt, small black bow tie; and he was militant.</p>

<p>"I want to ask you something, sir."</p>

<p>"Need you call me 'sir'?"</p>

<p>"Maybe. Look. I'm very fond of Virginia. I'm kind of her
brother. I notice you hanging around her, and you don't belong down
here in the slums."</p>

<p>"Slums?"</p>

<p>"I guess they're that to you. You belong on the Heights. I want
to know what the idea is. I guess, aside from your being a judge,
that you could break me in two&mdash;you're a sporting gent, I
suppose. But if I found out that you were just having a little fun
trying to make her, I'd take a chance on killing you."</p>

<p>"Eino, that's funny."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"Because that's the way I've been thinking about you! I'm in
love with Jinny. I want to marry her, if I can. You're in love with
her, too?"</p>

<p>"And how! Except when she gets frivolous when I talk about the
principles of co-operative distribution." Eino sighed. "But I can't
marry anybody, for years."</p>

<p>"So&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, you probably win. You would!"</p>

<p>"Eino!" The boy was astonished by Cass's fervor. "There's nobody
else to whom I can say this. I worship that girl, and I hope you'll
be my friend as you are hers."</p>

<p>"Okay," said Eino, tragically.</p>

<p>Cass said good-bye to her at one-thirty, in the presence of the
entire underground. Before going to bed, he spent half an hour in
stroking Cleo and wanting to telephone to Jinny. But he held off
till next evening and then demanded, Would she take a walk with him
tomorrow evening?</p>

<p>Yes. Without reservations.</p>

<p>He hoped the Bunch hadn't been too hard on him after he had
crawled away&mdash;</p>

<p>"Judge, you never crawled!"</p>

<p>"<i>Cass!</i>"</p>

<p>"Cass."</p>

<p>"Tomorrow at eight? And a movie afterwards?"</p>

<p>"<i>And</i> a movie. And a caramel sundae."</p>

<p>With that telephone conversation, touching on the deeper issues
of life and passion, he felt satisfied. He was irritated but too
canny to say anything about it when Mrs. Higbee (with the aid of
Cleo) brought him an evening toddy and looked ribald and
knowing.</p>

<p>"I can't run this big house all by myself," inwardly complained
Cass, who never yet had run it.</p>

<h2>Chapter 11</h2>

<p>Bergheim, Cass's house, the old Eisenherz country place, looked
out over the bluffs. It had neither a city nor a suburban aspect,
but suggested a comfortable village. At the back, where the grass
was more like an ancient pasture than a prim lawn, there was a
green-painted wooden well, and the white-painted stable, with its
pert cupola, suggested a print of the 1880's and long gentlemen
with whiskers and driving-gloves, lace ladies with parasols, and
spotted coach-dogs with their tails aloft in that fresher breeze.
But what to Cass had always been, still was, a last touch of
European elegance in Bergheim was that it had Walnut-colored
Venetian blinds.</p>

<p>Across the street from Cass was the abode of Scott and Juliet
Zago, who had for years been notorious as being happily married.
They called their house, which displayed fake half-timbering, and
wavy shingles imitating thatch, sometimes "The Playhouse" and
sometimes "The Doll's House," Juliet, you see, being the doll. She
was thirty-five to Scott's fifty, but she let people think that the
gap was ten years greater. She was the chronic child-wife; she
talked baby-talk and wriggled and beamed and poked her forefinger
at things; and she often pretended to be the big sister of her two
small daughters.</p>

<p>Scott dealt in insurance, and he made jokes and made puns.
Juliet read all the books about China and Tibet and gave you her
condensed version of them&mdash;not much condensed, at
that&mdash;with her own system of pronunciation of Chinese proper
names.</p>

<p>Yet Cass, who disliked puns and was readily sickened by
baby-talk, did not detest the Zagos, and theirs was the only house
in the neighborhood to which Cleo ever wandered. For they were the
kindest of neighbors, as affectionate as parakeets.</p>

<p>On one side of Cass's place lived the Perfect Prutts.</p>

<p>John William Prutt, the father, was a banker; the most
first-rate second-rate banker in the entire state. He was president
of the Second National Bank. It could just as well have been called
the First National Bank, since the institution once so named had
perished, but Mr. Prutt's bank would have to be a second, never a
first nor yet a last. He was fifty years old and always had been.
He was perfect; in everything that was second-class he was perfect.
He was a vestryman, but not the leading vestryman, of St. Anselm's
Church; he had been a vice-president but never the president of the
Federal Club. He was tall and solemnly handsome, and he never split
an infinitive or a bottle.</p>

<p>His wife, Henrietta Prutt, his son, Jack Prutt, his daughter,
Margaret Prutt, his dog, Dick Prutt, and even his Buick car, the
Buick of the Prutts, were as full of perfection and Pruttery as
John William Prutt himself.</p>

<p>The Prutts lived in a supposedly little white Colonial cottage
that had somehow grown into a huge white Colonial army-barracks,
yet still breathed the purity of Jonathan Edwards, and just beyond
it, in a hulk of grim dark native stone, lived another banker,
Norton Trock, who collected china and sounded like a lady.</p>

<p>On the other side of Cass's house was the blindingly white,
somewhat Spanish and somewhat packing-box, stucco residence of
Gregory Marl, owner of the presumably liberal and Independent
Republican newspapers, the Banner and the Evening Frontier, with
the Sunday Frontier-Banner, the only English-language newspapers in
Grand Republic. He was a large, quiet, secretly industrious man of
thirty-five; he had inherited the paper but had raised their
circulations; he was a rose-grower and a Bermuda yachtsman. The
star of his household, and a bright and menacing November star, was
his wife Diantha, who was on every committee in town, and who knew
something and talked a great deal about painting and the drama and
a mystery called Foreign Affairs. But her major art was as hostess,
and as the Marls had no children, Diantha could spend weeks in
planning a party. She was the rival of Madge Dedrick as the general
utility duchess and Mrs. Astor of the city.</p>

<p>Madge Dedrick, relict of Sylvanus Dedrick, the lumber baron,
lived a little beyond the Prutts, in a handsome, high-pillared
Georgian house that had exactly the same lines (condensed) as Boone
Havock's and did not in the least look like it. Madge's half-dozen
small flower-gardens looked like gardens of flowers, while Mr.
Havock's looked like paper posies, the larger size, bought last
night and pinned on crooked in the darkness.</p>

<p>At seventy, Mrs. Dedrick was small and soft-voiced, powdery of
cheek, with tiny plump hands and great powers, held shrewdly under
control, of derision and obscenity. Now living with her was her
tall, doe-eyed, aloof, divorced daughter, Eve Dedrick Champeris,
who had been reared in Grand Republic, Farmington, New York,
Cannes, and Santa Barbara, and who had divorced the charming Mr.
Raymond Champeris on the good, old-fashioned grounds of drinking
like a sot and passing out at costly parties. It seemed like such a
waste of champagne, Eve explained.</p>

<p>Diantha Marl tempted society with high intellectual conversation
plus string quartets and dynamite cocktails; Madge and Eve Dedrick
with cool Rhine wines in a low-lit, satin-paneled room filled with
silver and crystal and cushions and exquisite legs and lively
spitefulness, so that the Wargates, who had ten times as much
money, politely accepted the invitations of both Diantha and the
Dedricks.<br>
<br></p>

<p>On all these rulers of Grand Republic Cass meditated, while he
fretted the question of whether Jinny would really like being
lifted from her boarding-house to the stuffy elegance of Ottawa
Heights. He wanted to persuade himself that she would like Boone
Havock and Eve Champeris better than Eino Roskinen and Sweeney
Fishberg. It was hard to play Prince to the Cinderella when he
suspected that all the windows in Castle Charming were glued shut.
He conducted extensive imaginary conversations with her, trying to
give both sides, which is likely to be confusing.</p>

<p>"Scott and Juliet&mdash;jolly people&mdash;wonderful at an
outdoor barbecue," he heard himself informing Jinny, who snapped
back, "Silly pair of clowns!"</p>

<p>"Gregory and Diantha Marl&mdash;leaders in public thought."</p>

<p>"Scared conservatives throwing calico babies to the union
wolves!"</p>

<p>"Bradd Criley and Jay Laverick and Frank Brightwing&mdash;very
amusing fellows."</p>

<p>"That's something <i>like</i> it. Just let me meet them, and you
keep the others."</p>

<p>&mdash;Now what kind of a mind have I got, to give a nonexistent
antagonist the best of an argument? As I'm making the whole thing
up anyway, why don't I have Jinny vanquished and humble and
adoring?<br>
<br></p>

<p>If he ever married Jinny, he would have to lure in new
dinner-guests without offending the old ones, and then, probably,
Jinny would not like the novelties. He thought of a party at which
he introduced the Rev. Dr. Evan Brewster, Negro pastor of an
unpainted Baptist church in the North End, and Ph.D. of Columbia,
to Dr. Drover and Eve Champeris, and how bored Dr. Brewster would
be by their patter and how much danger there would be that Jinny
would too openly agree.</p>

<p>Then, "Oh dry up!" said Cass to his imagination.</p>

<p>When the spring term of court was over, he was free for all
summer, except for special sessions and a few days in the outlying
towns of the district. They wound up with a solemn meeting of
Judges Blackstaff, Flaaten, and Timberlane _in re_ the portentous
question: should the judges of this district, when on the bench,
wear silk robes, as in Minneapolis?</p>

<p>The three dignitaries sat about the long oak table in Judge
Blackstaff's chambers, smoking unaccustomed cigars, the gift of
their host, and grew red-faced with the ardor of their debate.</p>

<p>"It's a matter of dignity," maintained Judge Blackstaff, looking
more than usual like Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes. "I don't hold
with these English wigs and heavy robes, but I do think we have to
show the public, which is so irreverent and flippant today, all
jazz and comic strips, that we represent the sanctity of
Justice."</p>

<p>"Dignity, hell!" Judge Flaaten protested. "Every time some
Norske or Svenske saw me in a black-silk nightshirt, it would cost
me ten votes. Besides, robes are hot."</p>

<p>Judge Timberlane put in, "Not very, Conrad. They can be quite
light. Besides, Grand Republic is the coolest city in the state
south of Duluth. Besides, do you want to have the boys on the bench
in Minneapolis go on laughing at us as a bunch of farmer
j.p.'s?"</p>

<p>"I don't care a damn what they laugh at as long as the voting
Lut'erans like us," insisted Judge Flaaten. He glared at Judge
Blackstaff. "Steve, this is a serious matter. Are we going to yield
up the high principles of common democracy to the
bawds&mdash;uh&mdash; the gauds of the outworn Old World?"</p>

<p>"Hurray!" breathed Judge Timberlane.</p>

<p>"Cass, can't you be serious?" worried Judge Blackstaff. "This is
a special court of protocol, which may go far to determine the
standing of the judiciary in Grand Republic for all time to come.
Write your votes on the yellow pads, boys, and fold 'em&mdash;and
give me back those pencils when you get done with 'em. It's a
caution the way my pencils get stolen!"</p>

<p>Silk robes for district judges won by two to one, and when
autumn came, none of them more proudly showed his robe to his
relatives than Judge Flaaten. Judge Timberlane did not care so
much. There was only one person for whom he wanted to wear his
robe, and by prodigious chicanery he lured her into the court to
see it. But&mdash; such is life&mdash;she only laughed.</p>

<h2>Chapter 12</h2>

<p>The select golf-and-tennis association of Grand Republic was the
Heather Club, three miles from the business center, on a peninsula
reaching out from the south shore of Dead Squaw Lake. Surrounding
it was the smart new real-estate development called the Country
Club District, habitat of such gilded young married couples as the
Harley Bozards, the Don Pennlosses, the Beecher Filligans, and the
playground of Jay Laverick, the town's principal professional Gay
Bachelor, who happened to be a widower. The houses were Spanish,
like Hollywood, or French, like Great Neck, and the Heather
club-house was a memory of Venice, with balconies, iron railings,
and a canal thirty-six feet long.</p>

<p>To the Heather Club in late June Cass came for one of the famous
Saturday Evening Keno Games. Keno (a sport beloved by the more aged
and pious Irishwomen also) consists in placing a bean upon a number
called out by some swindler unknown, through an unseen
loud-speaker, and after you have breathlessly placed enough beans
upon enough numbers, you fail to get the prize. It is not so
intellectual as chess or skipping the rope, but it is a favorite
among Grand Republic's leading citizens, who gather at the Heather
Club on every Saturday evening in summer, to drink cocktails and
play keno and then drink a lot more.</p>

<p>With only one cocktail in him, Cass was deaf to the joys of keno
this evening, and he wished that he were deaf to the crackling
voices about him at the dozen long tables, as he somberly put down
his beans. Roy Drover's shouts of "Send us a thirty-two, baby, send
us a thirty-two, come on, baby, come on, hand us a thirty-two"
merely rivaled Queenie Havock's parrot shrieks and Norton Trock's
high giggling, while Eve Champeris had a flushed mild imbecility
about her lily face. Delia Lent, a purposeful lady though rich, sat
beside Cass, babbling about trout-fishing, but presently he could
hear nothing that she said. All the hundred voices were woven into
a blanket of sound that covered Cass and choked him.</p>

<p>Abruptly, while Mrs. Lent stared at his lack of manners, Cass
bolted from the table, charged toward the bar. He would have to
have a quantity of drinks, if he was going to survive these
pleasures. He passed an alcove in which two grim women, too
purposeful about gambling to waste time on keno, were hour after
hour yanking the handles of twenty-five-cent slot machines. He
passed a deep chair in which sat two married people&mdash;not
married to each other. He looked into the card room where Boone
Havock, Mayor Stopple, Judge Flaaten, Counselor Oliver Beehouse,
and Alfred Limbaugh, the hardware king, were playing tough poker in
a refined way.</p>

<p>Jinny's spirit walked with him derisively.</p>

<p>He had almost reached the forgetfulness to be found at the bar
when beyond it, in the Ladies' Lounge, he saw Chris Grau, having a
liqueur with Lillian Drover. He stopped, in cold guiltiness, and
the imaginary Jinny fled.</p>

<p>He had not seen Chris for ten days, and as she looked at him,
all her kindness in her good brown eyes, he shivered. But he
obediently chain-ganged into the lounge. Lillian Drover rose,
tittering, in washed-out imitation of her husband's humor, "I guess
I better leave you two young lovers alone, if I know what's good
for me."</p>

<p>Chris's smile indicated that that would be fine.</p>

<p>The Ladies' Lounge, which had been named that by Diantha Marl,
after having been christened the Rubens Room by the Milwaukee
architect-decorator who had done the club in the finest Moorish
style known in his city, was a harem, with grilled windows, a
turquoise-blue tiled floor, and a resigned fountain. It was
suitable to the harem feeling that Chris should be wearing a
loose-throated lilac dress.</p>

<p>Cass sat facing her, with an entirely mechanical "Can I get you
another drink?"</p>

<p>"Not for me. There's too much drinking here. I'm glad you're so
sober. But then, you always are. It's these younger people that are
breaking down the bulwarks of society with their guzzling and
shrieking and indecent dancing."</p>

<p>"Now, now, Chris, the drunkest person here tonight is Queenie
Havock, and she's well over fifty, and I saw Bernice Claywheel, and
she must be over forty, out dancing on the terrace with Jay
Laverick as though she expected to eat him."</p>

<p>"Ye-es I know, but&mdash;You simply love the sweet young things,
don't you, Cassy&mdash;Cass."</p>

<p>"M?"</p>

<p>"I'm sure you had a wonderful time with your beautiful unknown
at the Unstable, two weeks ago!"</p>

<p>"Why, I&mdash;Yes I did!"</p>

<p>"And did you enjoy holding hands in the moonlight?"</p>

<p>He tried to be jaunty. "Enjoyed it very much. Especially as I
don't suppose I'll have another chance, alas!"</p>

<p>&mdash;Why don't you tell Chris to go to the devil? She's not
your guardian.</p>

<p>"So you don't think you'll see her again, eh, Cass darling.
Honestly, now&mdash;honest<i>lee</i>&mdash;you know I'm not the
nagging sort of girl that would even ask who she was, and certainly
I'm not the kind that would go around hinting and whispering that a
man who isn't so young any more&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What do you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"&mdash;is making a fool of himself over some young tramp. I was
just teasing you about this girl. Of course I <i>know</i> you'd
never fall for her, whoever she is. So let's not say anything more
about it, dear."</p>

<p>"I hadn't said anything at all!"</p>

<p>"That's what I say. Honestly, I was just joking. Now tell me:
will you get the Fleeber-Biskness case in the fall, or will they
settle it?"</p>

<p>Now the affaire Fleeber-Biskness was a fascinating controversy,
to Judge Timberlane, but it had not seemed so to the crass public.
It was a conversion case, dealing with the possession of a
warehouse 28' 7" X 62' 8". Cass was glad once more to see what a
sympathetic brain Chris had and, as he looked at them again, what
sleek legs. As the palace of pleasure rang with the bacchanalia of
keno, he explained to this willing hearer the low tricks Mr.
Biskness was accused of having played with a carload of clay. He
stumbled as she crossed her legs and he realized that, with
innocent spinster boldness, she had come without stockings.</p>

<p>This was in the prim pre-war era of 1941, when it is true that
bathing-suits had been reduced to an emphasized nudity, but when
perfect ladies still did not display naked legs in public rooms.
The Judge was a person of decorum and modesty, but he was
interested.</p>

<p>&mdash;Chris would give a lover such solid
affection&mdash;probably much more than a filly like Jinny
Marshland.</p>

<p>Not unmindful of the careless lilac-colored skirt but determined
to be high-minded, he went on with the case, winding up, "You
understand, that's only Fleeber's version, and it's a matter of
record. I'm not giving away any secrets."</p>

<p>"Sure. I know you never tell tales out of court," said Chris,
fondly.</p>

<p>"If I ever did, you'd be the one person I could rely on. What's
say we have a drink?"</p>

<p>"I'd love to," gurgled the strange woman in lilac.<br>
<br></p>

<p><b>An Assemblage of Husbands and Wives</b>
</p>

<p><i>The Zebra Sisters</i>
</p>

<p>The Quimber Girls, better known to the ribald of Grand Republic
as the Zebra Sisters, belonged to a real family, lively and
devoted, full of anecdotes that began with laughter and, "Oh, do
you remember the time when." Their father, Millard Quimber, who was
still alive, aged eighty-one, was the city superintendent of
schools from 1895 to 1928. He was referred to in the press as "one
of our greatest builders," because during his reign there had been
erected three red-brick school-buildings which looked like
red-brick school-buildings. He was also known as a "profound
scholar," because he continually quoted Bobby Burns and Henry Van
Dyke and the first two lines of the Iliad, almost in the original
Greek.</p>

<p>His three daughters were named Zoe, Zora, and Zeta; they were
born between 1890 and 1900; they were fine, big, bouncing hussars
of women, hearty at winter sports, discursive about their husbands,
all philoprogenitive, all ardent Presbyterians, though with secret
desires to be Episcopalians and chic. Their favorite words were
family, chickabiddies, earnest, expensive, womanly, jolly, and ice
cream.</p>

<p>Their several husbands were derisively referred to at the
Heather Club bar as the Brothers-in-Law, Incorporated.</p>

<p>Zoe, the youngest daughter, was married to Harold W. Whittick,
the owner of radio station <i>kich</i> and of Whittick &amp;
Bruntz, a two-room advertising agency which existed chiefly to tell
a house-hungry world about Wargate Wood Products. When the chairman
of a Rotary Club luncheon at which Harold W. was to speak (about
Progress) asked him what to say in introduction, Harold W. wrote a
description of himself which may stand as modest and accurate:</p>

<p>"Not only the most streamlined but the most up-to-the-second
moderne citizen of Grand Republic."</p>

<p>But Harold W. was, as the chairman laughingly said&mdash;you
know, kidding him&mdash;not himself in Rotary, because he was
National Assistant Treasurer of the rival Streamlineup Club, a
service organization distinctive in that it had all the speeches
<i>before</i> lunch, when everybody was "still on his toes, full of
ginger and not of hash."</p>

<p>Zora, the middle Zebra, was fondly wed to Duncan Browler, first
vice president of the Wargate Corporation, in charge of
manufacture. Unlike Harold W. Whittick, he did not make
speeches.</p>

<p>The oldest, Zeta, was married to Alfred T. Umbaugh, a gentle and
predatory soul who admired his brother-in-law Harold and who, more
nearly than the other two husbands, endured the demands of his wife
that he be jolly and amorous. He was the chief owner of the Button
Bright Chain of Hardware Stores, twenty-seven of them, all shiny
and yellow, scattered through Minnesota and the Dakotas, with one
far-flung outpost or consulate in Montana. This imperial standing
made him, like Browler, eligible to the Federal and Heather Clubs.
Naturally, Whittick had also been admitted to those twin heavens,
but with a warning from the committee that he would do well not to
get oratorical and forward-looking after his fourth highball, and
while he was at the table of the blest, he was about ten feet below
the salt.</p>

<p>Harold, Duncan and Alfred were unlike in tempo, but they were
all true husbands to the Zebra. All three of them were irritated by
their wives but never thought of quitting them, all of them had
sons and daughters, all were devoted to golf, fishing,
musical-comedy movies, motor boats, and Florida, and all of them
had new houses, in the Country Club District, of which they were
fiercely proud and for which they would have done murder. None of
them was eccentric, except that Harold W. Whittick&mdash;just for a
josh, everybody said; to show off and try to be
different&mdash;asserted that he had once voted for a Democratic
candidate for the presidency, Mr. Franklin Delano Roosevelt. And
all of them, though grumblingly, consented to be ruled and
extensively discussed by The Family.</p>

<p>They all dined with Grampa Quimber every Sunday noon; and each
Thursday, one of the three sisters was hostess to the others and
their broods, with the one great-grandchild in The Family, that of
the Umbaughs, asleep upstairs. At these feasts, Harold W. Whittick
usually told the story about the Irishman and the cigar-counter
girl; and there was a good deal of innocent laughter about the
time, in 1936, when Mr. Browler got drunk at an Elks' Convention
and bought a small red fire engine.</p>

<p>An unusual feature of the Zebra gatherings was the
fifteenth-century frankness with which the sisters reported on the
progressive feebleness of their husbands as lovers. They were
rugged and healthy girls, and expected a lot, and did not get it.
However, they sighed, it was something that neither Harold W. nor
Alfred T. nor Duncan "ever so much as looked at any woman outside
the home."</p>

<p>That's what they thought.</p>

<p>The Brothers-in-Law, Inc. jointly made business trips to
Minneapolis, where they stayed at the magnificent Hotel
Swanson-Grand, with three connecting bedrooms and a parlor. Of the
uses to which these rooms were put, the Sisters knew nothing. The
Brothers-in-Law were stalwarts, pledged and reliable, and so were
their Grand Republic friends who managed to be in Minneapolis at
the same time.</p>

<p>Half an hour after the Brothers' arrival, the parlor was turned
into a complete bar. Within half an hour more, the girls had
arrived&mdash;not traditional young blondes who glittered, nothing
so frigid and boring, but dependable young women of thirty, who
worked in offices and banks and stores, who understood hard liquor
and liked men.</p>

<p>By two next morning there was a tremendous amount of laughter
and communal undressing, to the nervous delight of such Grand
Republic visitors as Mayor Stopple, Harley Bozard, Jay Laverick,
and Boone Havock.</p>

<p>New York and Chicago and London visitors to Grand Republic,
particularly if they were journalists renowned for shrewdness,
concluded that Harold W., Alfred T., and Duncan were the most
conventional, most standardized, most wife-smothered and
children-nagged citizens of our evangelical land, but in truth they
belonged among the later Roman Emperors, and he that has never seen
Duncan Browler, elder of the Presbyterian Church, standing in his
cotton shorts, a lady telephone-supervisor clasped in his right
arm, a half-tumbler of straight Dainty Darling Bourbon Whisky
waving in his left hand, the while he sings "It's Time to Go
Upstairs," has only the shallowest notion of the variety of culture
in our Grand Republic, a city which, in different dialects, has
also been called Grand Rapids and Bangor and Phoenix and Wichita
and Hartford and Baton Rouge and Spokane and Rochester and Trenton
and Scranton and San Jose and Rutland and Duluth and Dayton and
Pittsfield and Durham and Cedar Rapids and Fort Wayne and Ogden and
Madison and Nashville and Utica and South Bend and Peoria and
Canton and Tacoma and Sacramento and Elizabeth and San Antonio and
St. Augustine and Lincoln and Springfieldill and Springfieldmass
and Springfieldmo and Ultima Thule and the United States of
America.</p>

<h2>Chapter 13</h2>

<p>Judge Timberlane had heard of middle-aged satyrs who worked
their will upon frail maidens by promising them riches and
magenta-colored cars but never introduced them to the respectable
families of their circles. But the Judge himself wanted his entire
world to know his fleet Jinny. He stopped in at Miss Hatter's, he
discussed with Tracy Oleson the import of wood pulp, then got Jinny
aside to whisper, "I'd like to have a buffet supper for you and
have you meet my friends&mdash;you needn't like 'em if you don't
want to. And maybe you'd like to invite Tracy? He's quite a bright
fellow."</p>

<p>Perhaps he sounded condescending, without meaning to, for she
answered irritably, "I don't want to meet a lot of rich people
looking for somebody to snub!"</p>

<p>"But very few of them are rich and none of them are snobbish. I
meant people like Abbott Hubbs, managing editor of the Banner. I'll
bet the owner, Greg Marl, doesn't pay him enough to afford
breakfast. And my sister, Rose Pennloss, and my old chum, Bradd
Criley&mdash;good lawyer and the best dancer in town. People that
you'd love, if you knew 'em."</p>

<p>"I don't want to be shown off, Cass. I'm perfectly happy right
here where I am, and if I do ever get anywhere else, I want to do
it by myself."</p>

<p>It took him five minutes to persuade Cinderella that the glass
slipper was pretty and then, just to keep him entirely confused,
she said that she would love a party, and if she had sounded
grudging, it had been only because she was surprised.<br>
<br></p>

<p>The buffet-supper for her was to be at the Heather Club, which
was crowded only on Saturday evenings. When he picked her up in his
car, she did not expect him to take Tracy Oleson, that muffler,
along with them; and she was not prudish when he suggested that, as
they were early, they could stop at his house on the way. (It was
not on the way.)</p>

<p>At Bergheim she stepped out wonderingly under the wedding-cake
carriage-porch and pronounced, "Oh, I love it! Like Walter
Scott!"</p>

<p>She was wearing again the little black net dress in which she
was so pathetically grown-up, and the one silver rose.</p>

<p>Silent, head turning quickly to one side and the other, she
preceded him into the dolorous hall, into the drawing-room, which
was too long, too narrow, and too high, and in one corner
surprisingly darted off, under a varnished pine grill, into a
semicircular alcove which was the lowest story of the tower. It was
an ill-lighted room, with wallpaper of Chinese pagodas and bridges,
with overcarved and unwieldy furniture upholstered in plum-colored
plush and ornamented with a Michigan version of Chinese dragons; a
room profuse in Chinese vases, Aztec pottery, embossed brass coffee
tables, Venetian glass lamps, and colored photographs of Lake
Louise; a room that was unutterably all wrong, and yet was stately
and a home.</p>

<p>Jinny stood in the middle and looked about, neither awed nor
ridiculing it, belonging to it as (Cass fondly believed) she would
belong to any setting she might encounter.</p>

<p>Then Cleo came bossily into the room on delicately haughty feet,
wanting to know who the deuce this was in her house.</p>

<p>Jinny gave a passionate little moan, a sound not so unlike a
cat's, soft and imploring, and knelt before Cleo, smoothing the
side of her jaw. The kitten recognized her as one of the tribe, and
spoke to her in their language. Jinny sat crosslegged then and Cleo
perched on her knee like a small brave statue. Acrobatically, not
to disturb the kitten, Jinny reached out far for the evening purse
that she had dropped, looked up at Cass apologetically, and brought
out a tiny crystal model of a cat-goddess of the Nile.</p>

<p>"It's my talisman. Dad gave it to me years ago, as a toy, but I
almost let myself believe that it was alive and now&mdash;I know
it's childish, but I always take it everywhere&mdash;you know, so
it can see the world and get educated, poor thing."</p>

<p>"What's its name?"</p>

<p>"Different names at different epochs. All of them silly. Just
now it hasn't one."</p>

<p>"Why not call it&mdash;The kitten is also an Egyptian national,
and named Cleopatra. Why not call your statuette Isis?"</p>

<p>"Isis. 'Slim, undulant deity Isis, mistress of life.' Okay.
Let's see if Cleo will have sense enough to recognize a high-class
goddess and worship it."</p>

<p>She placed the crystal Isis on a mat made of her handkerchief,
on the cabbage-rose carpet, and Cleo before the shrine. They
watched gravely, Cass's hand on Jinny's shoulder, while Cleo walked
three times around the goddess, sniffing, then, with a careful paw,
pushed it over and glanced up at them, much pleased with
herself.</p>

<p>"They're friends, anyway," said Jinny.</p>

<p>"Like us."</p>

<p>"Uh-huh."</p>

<p>He kissed her, without prejudice.</p>

<p>He herded her into the kitchen, and announced, "Mrs. Higbee,
this is my friend Miss Marshland. The house is hers."</p>

<p>Well, Jinny smiled, Mrs. Higbee smiled, Cleo, sticking around
and quietly running everything from behind the scenes as usual,
made a sound that corresponded to smiling, and the augury was
bright.</p>

<p>Then Cass remembered that Mrs. Higbee liked Chris Grau, also,
and that Chris would formidably be at the buffet-supper
tonight.<br>
<br></p>

<p>They drove up to the Heather Country Club, which resembled the
Home of a Famous Movie Star, and Jinny was apparently delighted by
its yellow tile roof and its grilled windows and blue plaques set
in white plaster walls. They crossed the clattering stone-floored
lobby to the outdoor terrace on which, this fine June night, the
supper was handsomely set out: a baked ham, with cloves stuck all
over its sugary bulk, lobster salad and chicken salad and cold
salmon, and an exuberant ice-cream mold decked with spun sugar.
These treasures were assembled, like a jovial combination of
Christmas and Fourth of July, on a long table at one end of the
thatch-roofed outdoor bar. At the other end of the bar was the real
business: a case of Bourbon, half a case of Scotch, and a
cocktail-shaker of the size and menace of a trench-mortar, all
guarded by the club bartender, who knew all the amorous and
financial secrets of the members. As to wine, most prominent
citizens of Grand Republic, including Cass, were unaware of it
except as something you nervously ordered on a liner.</p>

<p>There were to be twenty-six at the supper, and six tables, lacy
and silver-laid, were on the terrace, with Dead Squaw Lake swaying
beyond them, and the pine-darkened hills and the red-roofed yacht
club visible on the farther shore.</p>

<p>But none of this luxury did Cass behold. What he saw was Chris
Grau, happily arranging the flowers, and her happiness chilled
him.</p>

<p>He had not told Chris nor any one else that this supper was to
be the introduction of a Miss Virginia Marshland to his friends,
and it was assumed that this was another of the duty dinners which
unmarried favorites like Cass and Bradd Criley and Jay Laverick
give&mdash;the technical word is "throw"&mdash;now and then when
their social obligations have reached the saturation point. Chris
had insisted that he let her order the supper, be the hostess.</p>

<p>She was busy now, in her fresh cream-colored linen dress, her
gaudiest costume jewelry, arranging the huge bunches of peonies. At
Cass's footstep, she looked up with a smile that went cold when she
saw him with an unknown wench who was too airy and much too
pretty.</p>

<p>The oratorical pride of the Bar Association could do no better
than: "Chris&mdash;Miss Grau! Miss Marshland&mdash;uh&mdash;Jinny
Marshland."</p>

<p>Both women said "Jdoo" with good healthy feminine hatred, and
Cass was rather surprised.<br>
<br></p>

<p>In making up his list of guests, he had not been able to avoid
having Roy and Lillian Drover, though he did not expect Jinny to
like them. He thought she might like his sister Rose and the Gadds
and Greg Marls and the Abbott Hubbses and the Avondene girls and
even the giggling Scott Zagos. He was sure that she would like
Bradd Criley and once, a few days ago, before he had lost his
innocence, he had hoped that Jinny and Chris might "hit it off
nicely," having no sounder reason for that hope than that it would
be considerably more convenient for him if they did. And Eve
Champeris, of Paris, California, and Grand Republic, the most
exquisite and linguistic woman in town&mdash;he himself had never
been comfortable with Eve, and he had invited her entirely to
impress Jinny.</p>

<p>He had been more daring than anyone can know who does not live
permanently in Grand Republic in leaving out Boone and Queenie
Havock&mdash;daring and sensible, since at one macaw scream from
Queenie, Jinny might very well have started walking home. But the
Havock scion, Curtiss, he had invited. Curtiss was a bulky,
cheerful, unmarried, somewhat oafish young man who was supposed to
work in the Blue Ox National Bank but who was more earnest about
fast driving and who was supposed, for reasons incomprehensible to
Cass, to be attractive to young women.</p>

<p>Especially for Jinny, he had asked Tracy Oleson, Fred Nimbus,
announcer at Station <i>kich</i>, Lucius and Erica Fliegend, and to
keep the Fliegends from feeling chilled at the Heather Club, in
which they had not been present five times in ten years, he had
invited that intelligent young couple, Richard and Francia Wolke
(the Chippewa Avenue jewelers) who had <i>never</i> been in the
club. Chris had not seen his list and now, as she looked over the
party, she tenderly thought that she had never known her Cass to
show so superbly the trusting social ineptitude for which she loved
him and wanted to mother him. Curtiss Havock would insult the
glibly handsome Fred Nimbus who would annoy Eve Champeris who would
be insolent to the Wolkes who would bite the Zagos who would
nauseate Dr. Drover who would be rude to the Hubbses who hated
their bosses, Gregory and Diantha Marl, while Chris herself would
have been just as glad if he had not invited Stella Avondene
Wrenchard, that impoverished and aristocratic young widow who was
so resolutely after Cass for herself that she went around saying,
"I adore Chris&mdash; poor dear."</p>

<p>And when Chris found that he had added this unknown young
fly-by-night called Miss Virginia Mushland or something, then she
was almost as irritated as she was tender. So far as Chris could
see, he had done everything to insure his social ruin in Grand
Republic except to invite the local labor-organizers.</p>

<p>This Mushland doll was evidently too awkward and untutored to be
of any use, and Chris went ardently to work at what is called
"making the party a success." While Cass filled the unwanted girl's
plate at the buffet and sat beside her at table, shamelessly
beaming, Chris maneuvered the guests to suitable tables, kept
Curtiss Havock from having too many drinks and the Fliegends from
having too few, had Jinny switch seats with Stella Avondene, to
prevent scandal and to keep Cass's errant fancies on the move, got
Fred Nimbus, the radio genius, to sing, got Fred Nimbus to make a
comic speech, got Fred Nimbus to start the dancing&mdash;with
Jinny.</p>

<p>Chris saw to it that Jinny also danced with Bradd Criley,
Curtiss Havock, Dick Wolke, Greg Marl, and only twice with Cass, to
the end that Jinny, who had at first been embarrassed by the
strangers, had a lively evening and loved Cass for it&mdash;Cass,
not Chris.</p>

<p>All this good sacrifice Chris made for Cass, and was sorry only
that he did not see it.</p>

<p>But Cass did see it, and he knew now how a burglar felt when he
was facing Judge Timberlane.</p>

<p>He understood Chris's loyalty and her plump charms. He wondered
why the Fates should so arrange it that he could feel only amiable
toward Chris, who wanted him, and be wan and adoring with the Jinny
who as yet considered him merely another traveling-man.</p>

<p>With a jar he found that Jinny, too, was seeing everything that
she couldn't possibly see. When, long after eleven, he had his
second dance with her&mdash;he had watched the match-unmaking Chris
throw her to such dogs as Fred Nimbus&mdash;Jinny said with an
affection he had never heard from her:</p>

<p>"Dear Cass, I am having such a gay time, thanks to you and to
your Miss Grau. That nice woman. She does try so hard to hate me,
but she doesn't know how. She tried to snoot me by asking how I
liked 'working in a factory,' but before she got through, I had her
longing to get off her chaise-longue and be big and brave and punch
a time-clock. Cass, you are so good and so bungling. You know I'm
just a stray cat, like Cleo. I wouldn't want to&mdash;because I am
so fond of you&mdash;I wouldn't want to make any trouble between
you and Chris the girlfriend. Honestly."</p>

<p>He made the suitable arguments.</p>

<p>He knew that, seen as just one of the "country-club bunch," he
had lost for her something of his dignity as a Public Figure, but
he also knew that she was now responsive to him. He was proud of
her debut. She had been so easy with even the most difficult of his
guests, with his over-inquisitive sister and with the roaring Roy
Drover. Bradd Criley had informed him that Jinny was a "lovely,
intelligent girl, and a stepper." That was news!</p>

<h2>Chapter 14</h2>

<p>When the party had meandered to its quiet ending, when the older
pleasure-maddened citizens had gone home to bed and the stoutly
drinking remnant had moved indoors to escape the chill, Chris gave
up her impersonal rule as mistress of the revels and settled down
at a table with Cass, Jinny, Tracy Oleson, the inebriated Hubbses
and the soused Curtiss Havoc, and began to pay loving though
discouraged attention to Cass.</p>

<p>He was alarmed. No more than any other man did he want to face
the unwed lioness robbed of her wish-dream cubs, the chronic wife
who resents the straying of her husband just as much when he is not
yet her husband. He had hoped to slip away with Jinny, and perhaps
be invited in for an incautious moment.</p>

<p>Curtiss belched. Hubbs said, "I agree." "Then I'll take you
home," said Mrs. Hubbs. Tracy rose. "Judge, I can save you a trip.
I'll drive Jinny back&mdash;I have my little bus here."</p>

<p>Treacherous as all sweethearts, Jinny babbled, "Oh, thank you,
Tracy. Judge, I did have such a good time. Thank you for inviting
me...Good night, Miss&mdash;uh&mdash;Miss Grau."</p>

<p>Cass was alone with Chris.</p>

<p>"I think they all enjoyed it, don't you, Chris?"</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"Due mostly to you, though. You were the perfect hostess. I was
amused the way you kept steering Curtiss away from the bar."</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"And I don't know how you ever managed to coax such a beautiful
supper out of the steward, and when you think&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Cass!"</p>

<p>"What is it, dear?"</p>

<p>"'Dear'! Cass, have you fallen for that young female
grasshopper, that Marshland girl, at your age?"</p>

<p>"What d' you mean, 'At my age'?"</p>

<p>"I mean at your age!"</p>

<p>"I'm the second youngest district judge in Minnesota!"</p>

<p>"And probably you're <i>the</i> youngest octogenarian. I know
you can still play baseball and dance the tango, only you don't.
You like the fireside and your books and chess."</p>

<p>"So I'm that picturesque figure, the venerable judge. Why don't
you put in slippers, along with the fireside and the
books&mdash;you mean <i>old</i> books, that smell of leather!"</p>

<p>"Well, your books mostly do, don't they? I just can't see you
with a gilt-and-satin copy of 'Mademoiselle Fifi,' or whatever it
is your Virginia reads."</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what she reads! She reads Santayana and Willa
Cather and, uh, and Proust! That's what she reads!"</p>

<p>"Does she? I didn't suppose she could read. She certainly
doesn't show any stains from it."</p>

<p>"Just because she doesn't go around showing off like a young
highbrow&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, Cassy&mdash;Cass, I mean&mdash;I'm sorry. I truly am. The
last thing in the world I meant to do was to start scrapping with
you." They were on a couch in the club lounge. A bartender and four
late bridge-players and the two female slot-machine addicts were
still present, and he felt that otherwise Chris would crown her
humility by kneeling before him, as she went on:</p>

<p>"It's just that we started twenty years ago, when you were a
veteran of twenty and I was a worshiping brat of ten, no, eleven,
that could hide her reverence for you only by being saucy, and so I
got the miserable habit of jabbing at you and&mdash;Cass! Do you
take this little Marshland girl seriously? An exquisite little
thing she is, too, I must say, and probably fairly intelligent and
even virtuous, curse her! I mean, damn her! Do you think you're a
little in love with her?"</p>

<p>"I think I'm a good deal in love with her. I agree with you in
saying 'damn her'! I didn't want to be in an earthquake. You're
dead right, my dear; I do prefer quiet. But I'm simply
God-smitten."</p>

<p>She sighed then, sighed and was silent, and at last she talked
to herself aloud:</p>

<p>"If I had been more brazen, if I hadn't been so scrupulous, I
could have married you several years ago, my friend. Right after
Blanche. I'm the only person you've ever really talked to about
Blanche. Isn't that true?"</p>

<p>"I suppose it is."</p>

<p>"And how she made fun of you and hurt you? Maybe you like to get
hurt. You're going about getting hurt again in just the right way.
Now don't tell me that your Virginia wouldn't want to hurt anybody!
I'm sure she wouldn't&mdash;intentionally. It's just that all you
overimaginative men, who try to combine fancifulness with being
clock-watching executives, are fated to be hurt, unless you love
some kind-hearted, sloppy, adoring woman like me&mdash;the born
mistress! Well, as Dad always said, 'Nun, so geht's.' Good
night."</p>

<p>He would not run after her, and before he had stalked out to the
automobile entrance, she had driven away, in her fast,
canary-colored coupe. He stood frozen, realizing that he was free
of his past.<br>
<br></p>

<p><b>An Assemblage of Husbands and Wives</b>
</p>

<p><i>Drovers And Havocks</i>
</p>

<p>Roy Drover was born on a farm just at the edge of Grand
Republic, and his father was at once a farmer and a
veterinarian.</p>

<p>When Roy was a medical student at the University of Minnesota, a
beer-drinker and a roarer by night but by day a promising
dissecter, he met the tall and swaying Lillian Smith, daughter of a
stationer who was refined, tubercular, and poor. He saw that here
was the finest flower he was likely ever to acquire for the
decoration of a successful doctor's drawing-room. Also, it tickled
his broad fancy to think of seducing (even if he could do it only
legally) anything so frail and sweet as Lillian.</p>

<p>She was overwhelmed by him, though she did break off the
engagement once when he used a certain four-letter word. He
reasonably pointed out, however, that either she did not know what
the word meant, in which case she could not be shocked, or else she
did know, in which case she must have got over being shocked some
time ago. She was conquered, though for years afterward she worried
about that logic.</p>

<p>By the time they had been married for five years and Roy had
practised for seven, Lillian's father was bankrupt, and Roy had the
daily pleasure of telling her that, though her "old man might be so
cultured and polite, he was mighty glad to get eighty bucks a month
from his roughneck son-in-law." That pleasure continued for years
after her father had died. At medical conventions or among
strangers in a West Coast Florida hotel, Roy would jovially shout,
"My ancestors were Vermont hill-billies, but my ball-and-chain
comes from the best stock in Massachusetts&mdash;such a good stock
that it's got pernicious anemia, and I've always had to give it a
few injections of gold."</p>

<p>He continued to feel physical passion for Lillian&mdash;as well
as for every gum-chewing hoyden that he picked up on his trips to
Chicago, and for a number of his chattier women patients. Perhaps
his continued zest came from the fact that it amused him to watch
his wife shiver and reluctantly be conquered. To her, the whole
business of sex had become a horror related to dark bedrooms and
loud breathing. Sometimes in the afternoon, when Lillian was giving
coffee to quiet women like the Avondene girls or the Methodist
minister's wife, Roy would come rampaging in, glare at her
possessively, growl "H'are yuh" at the guests in a way which said
he wished they would get out of this, and as soon as they had
twittered away, he would rip down the zipper of her dress.</p>

<p>She often thought about suicide, but she was too blank of mind.
She was always reading the pink-bound books of New Thought leaders,
those thick-haired and bass-voiced prophets who produce theatrical
church-services in New York theaters, and tell their trembling
female parishioners that they can accomplish anything they wish if
they Develop the Divine Will Power and Inner Gifts...Sometimes Roy
threw these books into the furnace.</p>

<p>Lillian never contradicted him. She was mute even when he teased
her about her dislike for having dead mallards or pheasants drip
blood on her dress when she went hunting with him.</p>

<p>At the beginning of our history, the Drovers had been married
for thirteen years. They had two sons, William Mayo and John
Erdmann Drover, aged eleven and nine. Lillian was devoted to them,
often looked at them sadly, as though they were doomed. She begged
them to listen while she read aloud from Kenneth Grahame and her
own girlhood copy of "The Birds' Christmas Carol," but the boys
protested, "Aw, can that old-fashioned junk, Mum. Pop says it's
panty-waist. Read us the funnies in the paper, Mum."</p>

<p>Like their father, the boys enjoyed killing things&mdash;killing
snakes, frogs, ducks, rats, sparrows, feeble old neighborhood
cats.</p>

<p>When Roy and the boys were away, she stayed alone in a shuttered
room, in a house that rustled with hate, in a silence that
screamed, alone with a sullen cook and a defiant maid. She did not
read much, but she did read that all women are "emancipated" and
can readily become "economically independent." She was glad to
learn that.</p>

<p>Roy and Lillian were often cited by Diantha Marl as "one of the
happiest couples, the most successful marriages, in Grand Republic;
just as affectionate as the Zagos, but not so showy about it."<br>
<br></p>

<p>The same authority, Diantha, publicly wondered whether Boone and
Queenie Havock, though by 1941 they had been married for
thirty-five years, would not "bust up," as the technical phrase
was. When, at their rich parties, Queenie got high and screamed
that Boone was a "chippie-chasing, widow-robbing old buzzard," he
frequently slapped her. She was almost as large as he and even
louder, and she retorted spiritedly by spitting at him, and
sometimes when he was entertaining Eastern Financiers or other
visiting royalty, she yelled at him, "Oh, shutzen Sie die mouth,"
which she believed to be German.</p>

<p>But in private, with their great arms about each other, these
shaggy gods sat up all night making fun of their neat neighbors,
drinking and shouting and cackling like pirates. When Boone was
almost indicted for stealing one hundred thousand acres of Eastern
Montana prairie, Queenie joyfully announced, "I'll come cook for
you in jail, you cutthroat!"</p>

<p>He answered admiringly, "You probably will, too, you catamaran,
but if you get any more finger-marks on my Cesar Franck symphony
records, I'll bust your ole head open."<br>
<br></p>

<p>Dr. Roy Drover often said, "My experience is that it's all
nonsense to say that marriage is difficult just because of
complicated modern life on top of the fundamental clashes between
the sexes. Yessir! It's all perfectly easy, if the husband just
understands women and knows how to be patient with their crazy
foibles. You bet!"</p>

<h2>Chapter 15</h2>

<p>Cass had become embarrassed over calling up her boarding-house
and having Tracy or Wilma answer, "Who do you want? Who? Oh. Who
wants her? Oh!" followed by a shadow of a giggle, and a half-heard:
"It's the Judge again. Can you beat it!" So in early July, to
invite her to the Svithiod Summer Festival, at which he would be
the guest-speaker and say a lot of enthusiastic things about
Swedish-Americans, which might impress a girl with a fancy for high
words, he wrote a note to her.</p>

<p>She answered, and for the first time he saw her writing.</p>

<p>Now to an expert, her script may have looked like that of any
trained stenographer, correct and round, but to Cass this was a
secret message from the captive princess in her tower. On the
envelope, he was "The Hon. Cass Timberlane." His name had never
looked so stately. Could he really be that monumental object to
<i>her?</i> Or, sudden jagged thought, did she consider the title
pompous?</p>

<p>Her T was bold, like a knight riding, and the o was precise yet
sweet, not too unlike a kiss. (That sentimentality he strongly
thrust from him, and shamefacedly took back again.) The square
envelope and the letter-sheet were of good linen, with a small
square "VM" which, his thumb told him, was printed. (Splendid!
Engraving would have been extravagant for her.)</p>

<p>Of the letter itself, of her first letter to him, he still had
not read a word. He was shy about it. He might know now whether she
loved him or considered him a bumbler. Then, breathing deep, he
plunged:</p>

<p>"Dear Cass."</p>

<p>&mdash;That's good. Not "Dear Judge." She thinks of me as a
friend, anyway. Of course "Darling Cass" would have been
better.</p>

<p>"Darn it, I have a date for your evening with the
Vikings&mdash;"</p>

<p>&mdash;Hard luck. Certainly is hard luck. She won't hear me make
my speech. I'd hoped she would. Still, her letter is
cordial&mdash;oh, it's more than cordial, it's really affectionate.
And some originality to the writing. Not stilted.</p>

<p>The letter continued:</p>

<p>"So I shall not be able to hear you. But I know you will be
wonderful. Call me up soon. Sincerely yours, Jinny."</p>

<p>&mdash;She really wants me to go on telephoning her! And she
signs it "Jinny," not "Virginia" or "Virginia Marshland." She does
like me!</p>

<p>During his first five readings of the masterpiece, he twice
decided that she liked him, once that she loved him furiously, once
that this was merely a routine answer with all the romantic flavor
of payment of a gas-bill, and once that she was bored by him and
intended, on his evening of oratory, to go off dancing with some
treacherous swine like Eino Roskinen.</p>

<p>He did nothing so puerile as to keep the letter in whatever
pocket was nearest to his heart; he merely thought about it. He
contented himself with locking it up in the steel box that
contained his will, his passport, a picture of his mother, a
certificate for a hundred shares of the late Overture Silver Mining
Company, and a photograph of his former wife, in a 1929 hat, which
he did not remember owning.</p>

<p>&mdash;Hm. Funny-looking hat. I wonder if the present-day hats
would look just as&mdash;Lord, I'd forgotten Blanche was so
beautiful. But she looks so calculating and possessive, where Jinny
is like a living brook. Poor Blanche. I'll bet her new English
in-laws snub her. Huh!<br>
<br></p>

<p>He had many walks with Jinny, on Sunday afternoons, and he
discovered that he did not know the city of which he was supposed
to be a leader. They found a lath-and-mud slum, with starved widows
and children living like war-victims upon property belonging to his
friend Henry Grannick, second richest man in town. On Jinny's
initiative, he went for the first time in two years into the museum
at the Wargate Memorial, which was three and three-quarters
minutes' walking-time from his chambers, and they saw the Indian
war-bonnets, the models of fur-trader's canoes, and were swollen
and proud with their own history.</p>

<p>They chattered all the while. The buffet-supper had given them
more of a common background, and they talked of "Chris" and "Roy"
as well as of "Tracy," for they were true Midwesterners in
referring to everybody up to the age of ninety-eight by his given
name.</p>

<p>They were as garrulous as two old friends at the Poor House, and
all through it he was unceasingly on the point of proposing to her,
yet never quite daring to. In her bright young ruthlessness, she
might dismiss him forever.</p>

<p>He was constantly stirred up by her iconoclastic though slightly
second-hand political creeds. As a mild and benevolent Republican,
who had to be a politician once every six years, however little he
liked cigars and the histories of Coolidge and Harding, he collided
with the fact that, early conditioned by her father's sympathy with
the Farmer-Labor Party, encouraged later by Eino's
internationalism, Jinny was Young Revolution at the inquiring
age.</p>

<p>As they explored the city's unrecognized slums, she wondered
aloud about the competence of the Prutts and Grannicks to control a
city, while she denounced the local "isolationists" and insisted
that America must join in the war against Germany, which had just
invaded Russia.</p>

<p>She was probably disappointed at the readiness with which Cass
agreed with all her challenges; she was probably unable to
understand that the Judge Timberlane who seemed to her so
conservative was considered by his neighbors, by his colleague
Judge Blackstaff, as a riskily radical young man.</p>

<p>He agreed that America is only at the beginning of democracy;
that the super-salesman, with the stigmata of his early toughness
or rusticity blandished away by barber and manicure girl, stands
with the workman whose face is pitted with soot and grease only at
the saloon, the polling-booth, and the grave.</p>

<p>If he was distinctly more leftwing than Jinny thought, he was
distinctly less so than he thought. He innocently considered
himself, even after election-day, democratically one with the
farmer, the section-hand, the pants-presser, yet he had always been
so occupied with members of the Federal Club and the dwellers on
Ottawa Heights that he was as detached from his constituents as any
country squire. A kind man, a just judge, an honest citizen who
believed that there must be plenty of public schools and no graft
in the water supply, he had not yet gone many years beyond the Good
Old Massa dynasty. And golf at the country club is a sweet odor in
the nostrils and a dependable anesthetic.</p>

<p>In the fresh air that Jinny always bore about her, he wanted to
defy his own ancestral cautions. She did not know, possibly he did
not know, how much he enjoyed cutting loose and being more of an
outlaw than he was. Later he was to believe that he might really
have become the rebel whom in these honied months he enjoyed
impersonating, if Jinny had really been the bold economic Amazon
she considered herself. It has always been the masculine version:
"She did not tempt me enough, so I did not eat."</p>

<p>Meantime, more innocent than ever, he made love not apropos of
swords and roses, but of the poll tax, the school system, and
German bombers.<br>
<br></p>

<p>In July she went home to Pioneer Falls for her two-weeks'
vacation, and he begged for an invitation to come up for three
days. Her mother wrote to him, welcomingly.</p>

<p>He had always liked his assignments to hold court at Pioneer
Falls, county-seat of Mattson County, because from the windows of
the court room he could see the re-echoed heavens of Lake Bruin.
Here there were none of the wild river valleys of the Grand
Republic country. The falls of the Sorshay River were only three
feet high, a sporting ground for minnows. A wedge of the old
hardwood country had been thrust northward from the base of the
state to Pioneer Falls, and the trees were not pine and poplar but
oak and maple and ironwood and basswood. Most of them had been
cleared away by the fine, high, destructive industry of the
frontiersmen, and the country was now an upland wheat prairie, and
Pioneer Falls a characteristic grain-belt village. The streets were
flat but sheltered by spacious elms and maples that had been
planted by the Yankee and German settlers.</p>

<p>The Marshland house was white and comfortable and simple, except
for an upstairs balcony with a triangular window behind it, and
Jinny's father, Lester the druggist, was simple and comfortable,
and Mrs. Marshland a darling. They wore baggy clothes and loved
their friends and they thought that Judge Timberlane was a
tremendous man and that their "little daughter" was a "mighty lucky
girl to have him take an interest in her and her art career." That
he could ever marry her or be her lover seemingly did not occur to
them.</p>

<p>He was embarrassed by their friendly desire to have him hold
forth like a pedagogue upon her talents&mdash;and her
unpunctuality, to have him give her measured advice about how to
become a real big-city cartoonist or a dress designer. He was even
more embarrassed by the fact that Mr. and Mrs. Marshland were only
fifty-three or -four, somewhat nearer to his own age than was
Jinny. He kept hinting that he belonged to her generation, not
theirs, but Jinny bedeviled him by mocking, at family dinner (fried
chicken and asparagus and peas from our own garden), "I wish you
three would now straighten me out about the Polish question and the
use of lipstick."</p>

<p>"Don't play with your food, Jinx," said Mrs. Marshland fondly,
at every meal.</p>

<p>Cass and Jinny picnicked on a bluff overlooking Lake Bruin, in
an old pasture of short worn grass and scattered oaks. Their table
was a slab of rock, splashed orange with lichens; their divan the
springy moss. They were idle and relaxed and in love, and they did
play with their food, with the hard-boiled eggs, the finger rolls,
the lemon-meringue pie eaten with fingers which were vulgarly wiped
on the flower-starred moss.</p>

<p>He looked like a woodsman, in laced boots and breeches and
mackinaw shirt of black and red and yellow. She wore moccasin
shoes, with slacks, but she made up for it by wearing a tight
sweater.</p>

<p>Reclining on the moss, replete and exquisitely sleepy, he
argued, "Put your head on my shoulder."</p>

<p>She looked mute and sulky; then she rubbed her cheek against his
shoulder and lay still. His arm was about her and it may have been
by accident that his hand touched the unbelievable smoothness of
her naked waist under the sweater. He snatched his hand away, but
his finger-tips kept the memory of that living satin, the tender
warmth of her soft side. In some panic he knew that he was afraid
of her and shocked by himself, but he protested, "Don't be such a
prude. Of course you love touching her. That's what it's all
about."</p>

<p>But any ideas he might have had about trying to betray her
seemed wondrously absurd.</p>

<p>He slipped his hand again about her unbodiced waist, and she let
it lie there warmly a moment before she detached it, gentle and
unoffended. And that was all that happened of fleshly love-making.
Yet now, with her head against his shoulder, they had been
converted, united, sanctified.</p>

<p>"Darling!" he said only, and kissed her lightly, and her head
settled back in contentment.</p>

<p>It was a poet, not a very skillful one, who began talking:</p>

<p>"Dear Jinny, do you know how lovely you are to me? I love your
eyes and your hair&mdash;it's very reckless today and it smells so
newly washed&mdash;and I love your childish fingers&mdash;do you
suppose that indelible-ink spot will ever come off?&mdash;and I
love your riotous and pretty undependable humor and your curiosity,
like Cleo's about everything, and your honesty and your disinterest
in money-making and your talisman, your crystal Isis&mdash;did you
bring her back to Pioneer Falls?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. Wrapped in a lovely nightgown. She insisted on
coming. She's as fascinated by men and their line as I am."</p>

<p>"You don't think I'm merely following a 'line' in what I say, do
you?"</p>

<p>"No! I think you're dear and good, and I think you really like
me."<br>
<br></p>

<p>They said nothing about being engaged, but like children they
made plans.</p>

<p>"Know what I'd like us to do, soon as the war between Great
Britain and Germany is over?" he urged. "Sail for Norway and
Sweden, which are the source of so much of the life around here,
and then go through Finland and dip down into Central Europe and up
to Moscow and then China and especially India. I've always been
crazy to see India, since I read Kipling as a boy."</p>

<p>"Wond'ful."</p>

<p>"And then we'll come back here and get settled down. We'll live
in Grand Republic in the summer and fall&mdash;most beautiful
Indian Summers in the world&mdash;and have our winters in Beverly
Hills and Havana and Rio de Janeiro."</p>

<p>"So we're just going to be hoboes and wasters, are we?"</p>

<p>"Sure&mdash;in our dreams. Look here, comrade, have we got to
have social significance even in our <i>dreams?</i>"</p>

<p>"I think I'll have to get a ruling on that. Meanwhile, what are
we doing all this <i>on</i>?"</p>

<p>"Can't I just as well dream myself two million dollars and a
year's leave from the bench, while I'm about it?"</p>

<p>"You're so heroic&mdash;in our dreams."</p>

<p>"Plans okay then?"</p>

<p>"Approved. Cass, maybe we really <i>could</i> do some of those
things, even without being rich."</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>"But why is it that nobody ever does do any of the things that
he's free to do?"</p>

<p>In that counsel of doom he was suddenly frightened out of his
spurious boyishness, and clutched her hand, as if to protect
her.</p>

<p>They silently looked out from the shadowing oaks to the
summer-enchanted lake. The farther shore was swampy and in the July
light was a gold-streaked utter green, with blackbirds bending down
the reeds. There was peace over all the land, and their fear
melted, and suddenly she was telling him, as she never had, of her
childhood in the white house in the prairie village:</p>

<p>"I was such a serious kid, always so busy. I had to keep track
of everything. I had note-books and note-books; I put down the
temperature of my dolls, every day, like a hospital chart, and all
the bright things they said&mdash;I made 'em up, only sometimes I
stole 'em from the other kids. And I collected birds' eggs and made
the most elaborate notes on just which tree I'd found them
in&mdash;I drew plans of the trees, with lovely arrows pointing. I
was sure that some day those notes would be terribly important to
some ornithologist. I suppose I'm still the greatest living
authority on snipe around Peterson's Slew.</p>

<p>"And then as fast as I learned a hymn in Sunday School&mdash;I
was a Congregationalist like you&mdash;I wrote it down on a card,
with my notations about what words to come down hard on, like
'<i>bring</i>ing in the <i>sheaves</i>' only, I thought it was
<i>sheets</i>.</p>

<p>"I didn't have any brothers or sisters, so they let me have the
attic all to myself, and up there I was the busiest man of affairs,
rushing from one thing to another: arranging my world-collection of
fans, two paper ones and one lace, and my gallery of movie stars,
and polishing a brass handle to something&mdash;I found it by the
road, and to this day I don't know what it was for&mdash;and
writing down the name of every new language that I heard of. I got
up to sixty-seven, and I intended to learn them all, including
Swahili and Liukiu.</p>

<p>"And then pets&mdash;our old cat, Percival, and a lot of other
cats and dogs and rabbits and a pet squirrel and a very
inappreciative garter snake. I used to have an animal drug store
and try to cure all their ailments with sugar-water. I don't think
I was so successful.</p>

<p>"Maybe a lot of the things that I did were to educate the little
blue bromo Seltzer bottle, the forerunner of my Isis, that I
sneaked out and took everywhere so it could see what was going on.
Oh, I must have been almost as silly at ten as I am now.</p>

<p>"And I took lessons on the mandolin. I could play 'Down Mobile'
and the Russian national anthem on it. I was so busy and so secret.
Nobody ever knew; Dad and Mother were swell about not prying. And
sometimes I had the most money that ever was&mdash;an entire penny.
I would go into Dad's store and he would pretend he didn't know me,
and he would advise me, very earnestly, and you'd be surprised how
many kinds of candy you could get then for a penny: maybe one red
and two striped and a licorice lozenge. I'll never have that much
money again, never."</p>

<p>"No, there never are any pennies like that after you are ten,"
said Cass. "And now you're as old as I am. I used to think of you
as eons younger, but now I feel as though we were the same age,
except that you aren't so cautious."</p>

<p>"And I think of you, Cass, as just my age, except that you have
more sense."</p>

<p>With an absorbed I-want-to-think expression, she wandered off,
along the shore, and he watched her sleepily. She looked mature and
thoughtful, till, throwing up her arms, she started violently
hop-skipping, all by herself, singing what sounded like a jazz
version of Celeste Aida, and then she seemed to be all of ten
again, and he reached into his pocket for a penny to give her.</p>

<h2>Chapter 16</h2>

<p>After the buffet-supper for Jinny, his sister Rose and Gregory
Marl said, "What a nice girl that was; like to see her again," but
Cass wondered that more people did not comment. He need not have
wondered; they did.</p>

<p>Everybody in town&mdash;it being understood that
everybody-in-town includes some three hundred persons out of the
85,000&mdash;discussed Jinny, by telephone, by letter, over the
directors' table, or at the Paul Bunyan Bar. But they did not
reveal this to Cass, for he was a man not overfond of being tickled
in the ribs.</p>

<p>But after he had ventured to Pioneer Falls, before he had yet
pressed, in a volume of Supreme Court digests, the buttercup that
Jinny had given him, then everybody concluded that they must rush
in and rescue him.</p>

<p>He was to play bridge at Boone Havock's, and before the fourth
player, Eve Champeris, arrived, Boone and Queenie, with her voice
like a flat trolley-wheel, set out to save him with the solicitude
of a couple of pigs eating their young. That they had never yet
seen Jinny made them no less authoritative.</p>

<p>Boone struck:</p>

<p>"Sit down, Cass, and take a load off your feet. Have a snort?
Don't be a fool; of course you will. Now, Cass, I want you to
listen to me and don't go interrupting and shooting off your mouth
just because you think you're such a high-brow and a judge and all
that junk while me, I never got through fifth grade. You haven't
any better friends in the world than me and Queenie."</p>

<p>"You're damn tootin'," confirmed Queenie, then remembered that
she was being refined and humanitarian this evening, and caroled,
"Are we ever! Oh boy, I'll say we are! A lot of bums are always
yessing you, Cass, because you're in politics, but me and Boone are
good-enough friends to tell you the truth. You know. For your own
good."</p>

<p>Cass had really come over to play bridge, not to have things
done for his good, and he was not a meek man. But he was their
neighbor, he was used to them, and in a frontier civilization you
are not offended by a neighbor if he does nothing worse than throw
tomahawks. He listened to Boone with only a slight biliousness.</p>

<p>"Cass, what's all this we hear about your going nuts over some
fifth-rate stenographer?"</p>

<p>"Some low-grade tart on the make," added Queenie, virtuously.
After all, Queenie had some background for her opinions on lowness.
Her father had kept some of the best saloons in Northern
Minnesota.</p>

<p>"I don't know what you two are talking about, unless you mean
Miss Marshland, a brilliant young artist in whose career I have
become slightly interested."</p>

<p>"'Slightly' is good!" jeered Queenie.</p>

<p>Boone roared, "I don't suppose you take her out to that
gyp-joint, the Unstable, more than three times a week!"</p>

<p>"I do not!"</p>

<p>"I don't suppose her and you were snooping around those
tenements on South Greysolon Avenue! You didn't tell each other
they were 'a disgrace,' and 'somebody ought to do something about
'em!' Well, I <i>own</i> those tenements, and if you want 'em I'd
be glad to give 'em to you and see what <i>you</i> can do with 'em!
Lot of Finns and Communists and Poles and Svenskas in there, never
pay their rent and use the banisters for firewood! But let that
pass. I'm so used to trying to do something for this community and
never get one word of thanks that I don't even pay any attention to
a lot of Red bellyaching, and I don't care <i>what</i> you said
about Havock Haven. But I do care when I see an old friend making a
fool of himself over a cute little gold-digger that just hangs
around to see what she can get out of him&mdash;and then probably
goes back to the boy-friend and they laugh their heads off at the
old goat!"</p>

<p>Cass broke.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't let you talk like this even if what you said were
true, but it isn't. Miss Marshland is decidedly a lady. No, that's
a bloodless word&mdash;she's an angel."</p>

<p>"Sweet little gold angel with blood in her eye!" screamed
Queenie.</p>

<p>"You sleeping with her?" Boone grunted.</p>

<p>"I am not! And even if&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Now don't go and get gentlemanly on us, son. We're only trying
to help you. You made a portion of a horse of yourself before,
marrying that high-hat Minneapolis snob with her phony Boston
accent, and we don't want you to do it again."</p>

<p>Cass must have said something confused and not impressive, for
Boone was unsquelched.</p>

<p>"There'd be some excuse for this new girl if you were doing a
little advanced necking with her, but if you're thinking about
marrying her&mdash;a cutie half your age&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She is not!"</p>

<p>"&mdash;that has an idea it would be swell to be Mrs. Judge
Timberlane, and expects you to stay up all night and dance with
her, or sit around and watch her dance with the younger guys, why,
then you're a worse fool than I thought you were, and I've always
rated you pretty high in damn foolishness ever since you gave up
what might of become a fifty-thousand-dollar law-practice to sit on
your dignity on the bench."</p>

<p>Queenie neighed, "Now you listen to me. A woman's heart knows.
None of these young girls want to be of any help to their husbands.
They just get married for the excitement of it and for what they
can get out of it, the little tramps, and so immodest&mdash;showing
their knees! If you <i>got</i> to get married, Cass&mdash;and I
don't see why; ain't there any lady clerks that know the answers in
your court house?&mdash;then why don't you pick out some dame of
thirty-five that'll stay home and take care of you, like I
would?"</p>

<p>He did not, as he longed to then and all through the ordeal of
bridge, slap them and walk out. But for a year it broke his habit
of the Havocks.</p>

<p>"He's spoiled&mdash;touchy as a pregnant woman," said Queenie
Havock to Eve Champeris, who said it to Chris who said it to Cass
who said it to himself.<br>
<br></p>

<p>He expected Roy Drover to be even more boisterous than the
Havocks, but Roy, when he caught Cass in the quiet reading-room of
the Federal Club, sounded like a physician, competent and
impersonal:</p>

<p>"Son, I hear you've fallen for that pretty little monkey you
brought to the Country Club. It's none of my business, but why
don't you try some ugly woman with a lot of passion, instead of one
of these anemic kids? They haven't any gratitude. I take it for
granted you don't intend to marry this chick&mdash;her a rank
outsider, that none of us know. You're not <i>that</i>
haywire!"</p>

<p>Cass tried to believe afterward that his retorts to Boone and
Roy and two or three other foul impugners and mongers had been in
the manner of a stately "Sir!" followed by a challenge. It is
doubtful. That would not have gone well with Radisson County
duck-hunters, especially when they loved him enough to risk his
wrath.</p>

<p>The one gentle effort at his salvation was that of Stella
Avondene Wrenchard.</p>

<p>The Avondenes were a Family, fond and unshakable. They were
impoverished aristocracy who were unconcerned about it so long as
they could be together in their old whitewashed brick house. The
head of the family, Verne Avondene, had been born, in Grand
Republic, to a million dollars in timberlands which had been
acquired, possibly honestly, by his grandfather, the great Indian
agent, who seems in the histories to have had no Christian name
other than "Colonel." Verne went to Yale and the English Cambridge
and was just looking into diplomatic careers when the family money
blew up. He did not complain; the game had been worth any golden
candle, and he had a comforting knowledge of Balzac and Monet and
Old English balladry, even if he could not earn more than
thirty-five dollars a week.</p>

<p>That sum he received in the insurance office of Scott Zago,
where he was respectfully entitled "office manager," meaning clerk
and assistant bookkeeper.</p>

<p>His wife, still slim and beautiful at sixty-five, said that
Verne was the greatest gentleman, the most gallant lover, and the
most amusing companion in Grand Republic, and she was a fair
judge.</p>

<p>Their two daughters lived with them. Stella had married an
engineer, Tom Wrenchard, but had been widowed by an accident within
the year, and come home. Her marriage had been so brief that most
people forgot it, and she was usually called "Miss Stella
Avondene." She taught domestic science in the Alexander Hamilton
High School. Her spinster older sister, Pandora, gentle and
affectionate and given to flowers and sketching and playing the
piano, which under her mild fingers sounded like a spinet, was in
charge of the children's department at the public library. Both
girls treated their parents as their equals, and the low white
brick house was full of fudge, cats, new novels, Delius,
water-colors, charades, omelets, and other people's children.</p>

<p>Stella had always thought well of marrying Cass, but had stayed
home from hunting in loyalty to Chris Grau. Now, she invented a
lovely theory: Chris had, probably for discreditable reasons,
jilted Cass, who in wan loneliness had turned to some pretty girl
or other who had no virtues. Except in a state of solitary madness,
a steady man like Cass could never marry out of Our Class, that
ancient aristocracy of Grand Republic, hoary with tradition, which
had been going on now for more than seventy-five years.</p>

<p>Stella wanted to save him.</p>

<p>The Avondenes had him in for supper. As they had a maid only
when Verne had had a lucky bet on the races&mdash;the last time had
been in 1939&mdash;they did all the housework, and they let Cass
help them wash the dishes (which he did unexpectedly well, being a
camper) while they all sang "Sweet and Low." Then Stella mended the
lining of his coat, poor girl. As his own housekeeper, Mrs. Higbee,
was very inspective and efficient about that sort of thing, he
suspected that Stella had made the small rip in the lining herself,
and he loved her for it.</p>

<p>He might have married Stella then. Perhaps he should have
married Stella, and grown peaceful to the point of Double
Solitaire, but it happened that either God or Cass Timberlane had
made of Jinny Marshland the eternal image of beauty walking with
silver feet the waves of dawn. Dear Stella Avondene, teaching in
your Sunday-school class at St. Anselm's, and smiling, in the white
kid gloves you cleaned at home, singing and a little sad and very
kind. You will never walk the waves at dawn. Dear Stella!<br>
<br></p>

<p>He heard something of the town rumors about Jinny. Apparently
Mrs. Webb Wargate had said that, though she honored Judge
Timberlane and would probably receive any ragtag of a wife that he
might drag in, yet she was regretful that such a man should be
planning to marry a girl whose real name was Marshandsky, whose
father was a drunken teamster on the Range, who had been a waitress
in the Pineland Hotel and an itinerant hired girl, and who was in
general a threat to the Best People of Grand Republic, so
intimately related to the Best People of Albany and Philadelphia
and Hartford.</p>

<p>The early Minnesota had its families with the correct and rigid
manners, the Emersonian scholarship, of New England; with an
annotated Horace and a frivolous fiddle lying upon the pious parlor
organ. It had its Romans like General Sibley and, in Grand
Republic, the Avondenes and Grannicks. But lesser and brisker
tribes like the Wargates had taken their togas.</p>

<p>Cass considered the Wargate peerage.</p>

<p>Old Dexter Wargate had started out in Minnesota in 1881 by
conducting a hardware-store and selling nails across the counter to
lumberjacks and half-breeds. He had married the daughter of Simon
Eisenherz, from Pennsylvania, who had come to Minnesota in 1854, to
acquire furs from the Indians in exchange for brass pots and
bootleg whisky, with some effect upon the number of murdered white
settlers, before he discovered how to steal millions of acres of
timberland.</p>

<p>Cass was not pleased when a family founded upon a whisky keg in
a log cabin felt superior to a girl crooning over her collection of
three fine fans in a village attic, secret and eager and
alone&mdash;so alone and helpless against the chatter at the
cocktail-hour.</p>

<p>He had only one moment of treachery to Jinny: when he wondered
whether to others she was as clearly divine as she was to him. He
remembered that the Juliet Zago who to him was a wiggling nuisance
was a fair young thing to her Scott, and that Boone Havock
seemingly felt no distress when his wife yelled like a buzz-saw.
Were there barbarians who might think that his Jinny had a touch of
the Zago whimsy, with her circulatory Isis? To him, she would
forever be a flame, but could his friends see her glory?<br>
<br></p>

<p>He was aware that Jinny had a temper. She was, he thought,
unconscious of what the Havocks and Wargates whispered, but if she
learned it, he was certain that she would reject him along with all
his clansmen forever. He had not planned to venture upon any talk
of marriage until they should have had a year of building up a
common background. But he felt now that he must not risk her
discovery of the gossip till she should be bound to him, protected
by him, and on an August evening when he was to take her to the
movies, he drove irresolutely toward her boarding-house with the
nervous intention of proposing to her.</p>

<p>The living-room at Miss Hatter's was empty. When Jinny appeared,
ten minutes late as usual, he sat in the preposterous patent-rocker
of 1890, and ventured, "I think we've done all the traditional
things that lovers do, even moonlight and picnic by a brook, up to
a point."</p>

<p>"But we aren't lovers, Cass."</p>

<p>"We might be."</p>

<p>"M."</p>

<p>"So I want you to come sit on my lap."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear no. That's very outmoded and reactionary, Judge."</p>

<p>"You sit on my lap!"</p>

<p>She did. He felt the pleasure of her body's closeness, but he
found that he was remarkably uncomfortable. She was heavier than
she looked, and there was extreme danger that the rickety chair
would fall over sidewise. He wished that he could think of some
polite way of telling her that it would be all right now if she
went over and sat on the couch. She sighed blissfully and moved
closer and his fingers tightened on her knee, and he was at once in
ecstasy and conscious that his right leg was cramped.</p>

<p>In that mingled state he said quietly, "Darling, you know how I
want to marry you."</p>

<p>"M."</p>

<p>"We must be married, and soon."</p>

<p>Silent.</p>

<p>"Will you?"</p>

<p>Silent and motionless.</p>

<p>"Jinny! Please!"</p>

<p>She spoke as quietly as he, with no tint of blushing in her
voice. "No, Cass, it's impossible."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"We could never make a go of it. I'm terribly fond of you, maybe
I'm a little in love with you, but if we were married it would be
too much of a strain."</p>

<p>"Difference in age?"</p>

<p>"Oh, you're not so much older. I've almost fallen in love with
men much older than you&mdash;one antiquated buzzard of fifty, in
Pioneer Falls when I was a kid&mdash;an evangelist he was, and was
he full of It! No. You're really younger than Tracy or Eino or that
Curtiss Havock lug; there's something awfully young and touching
about you. But I never could stand your set, not even your sister,
though she's nice, or that caramel sundae, Mr. Criley. They're all
a bunch of furnace-regulators and they talk about their
Middlewestern Hospitality but none of them invite Mr. Fliegend to
their houses. I couldn't do it, I honestly couldn't.
But&mdash;"</p>

<p>She was actually traditional enough to wind up with, "But let's
be the best of friends."</p>

<p>He pushed back her chin with angry fingers and kissed her
angrily, and she relaxed to it; a kiss long and confessing. Then,
to his shock and to the danger of his flopping over in the
patent-rocker, she sprang from his lap and stood smoothing her
hair, murmuring, "Somebody&mdash;"</p>

<p>There were footsteps. By the time Eino Roskinen came in, Jinny
was sedately sitting on the couch and Cass had straightened his
summertime blue bow-tie.</p>

<p>Jinny twittered, "Oh, Eino, the Judge wants to hear about the
new state dairy regulations. He was just asking me."</p>

<p>Eino was distressingly informed and accurate, and he produced a
fireworks-display of figures until Cass, to his annoyance, really
became interested. But he felt flat and baffled. How could he
persuade Jinny of the joys of a life-time of furnace-regulation? He
bravely put her out of his mind forever&mdash;forever until they
sat at the movie and her hand slipped unasked into his.</p>

<p>So the lover started all over again his daily task of being
crushed.</p>

<h2>Chapter 17</h2>

<p>He had, for Jinny, dinner at his house, with Rose and Donald
Pennloss and Abbott and Hortense Hubbs. Cleo went mad trying to
take care of them all.</p>

<p>Rose informed Cass, after dinner, "I do like your Marshland
girl. She's the cleverest of all your girls."</p>

<p>"<i>What</i> girls?"</p>

<p>"Oh, you know. How would _I_ know? And Cass, she's so pretty!"
Then Cass loved his sister, whom he had not infrequently considered
a nuisance.</p>

<p>He had persuaded Jinny to bring in a portfolio of her Fliegend
Toy drawings, that his friends might see that Miss Jinny was not
only the most beautiful but the most talented young woman living,
and he pressed them on Hubbs.</p>

<p>Abbott Hubbs was the neurotic, young-old newspaperman who hated
newspapers, who drank too much and smoked too many cigarettes and
was too snappishly cynical, and in the privacy of his meager home,
read poetry aloud to his wife, who loved and slapped and, during
hangovers, nursed him. He was always shaky, dropping cigarette
ashes on everything: a thin, wizened, black-haired, extraordinarily
honest and generous man, a victim of the days of war-bulletins and
smug syndicated columns and cameras and high finance in
newspapers.</p>

<p>Jinny had prepared sketches for a pasteboard political Punch and
Judy show. Hubbs looked at her piggish Mussolini, her melancholy
Hitler, her bulldog Churchill, her mocking Roosevelt, and he cried,
shaking ashes all over the sketches, "These are fine, these are
mighty fine. Jinny, could I take some of 'em and show 'em to Greg
Marl, at the paper?"</p>

<p>Cass noted, along with his pride in this discovery of Jinny's
genius, that this was the first time that any of his friends had
addressed her as "Jinny."</p>

<p>Next day, Gregory Marl, large and soft and diplomatic spoke to
him at the Federal Club.</p>

<p>"We think well of Miss Marshland's drawings at the Banner
office, Cass, and we're losing our cartoonist. He's going to enlist
in the Army&mdash;thinks America will get into the war, maybe by
the middle of 1942."</p>

<p>"<i>You</i> don't believe that, do you, Greg?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, not a chance. We'll go on furnishing supplies to
England, but we'll never enter the war."</p>

<p>"Maybe we ought to."</p>

<p>"Maybe&mdash;but we won't. But you never can persuade these
crazy youngsters like my cartoonist. So I would like to talk to
Miss Marshland. Does she understand reproduction processes?"</p>

<p>"Must&mdash;working at Fliegend's."</p>

<p>"Confidentially do you know what they're paying her?"</p>

<p>"Uh&mdash;thirty-five a week."</p>

<p>"Uh&mdash;I guess the Banner could hike that to forty-five."</p>

<p>Cass told himself that he was pleased that she could command all
this wealth.</p>

<p>When Jinny went worrying to Lucius Fliegend about the Banner
offer, Lucius insisted on her taking this nobler job.<br>
<br></p>

<p>On her last afternoon at the factory, in late August, they gave
Jinny a riotous party, with speeches by Mr. Fliegend, B. Ogden
Hathawick, the shipping clerk, the society reporter of the Grand
Republic Banner, and District Judge Cass Timberlane.</p>

<p>Her first cartoon for the Banner depicted an American eagle
meditatively though rather acrobatically scratching its beak with a
claw, as it gazed at a two-headed eagle with two crowns. Spirited
and original, felt Cass, and he made it the occasion for taking her
to dinner at the Unstable.</p>

<p>Where hitherto she had worked on the Southwest Side, now her
office was in the center of town, only three and a half blocks from
the court house, and as his fall term opened, Cass was demanding
that she lunch with him, at Charley's or Oscar's or the Pineland or
the Ladies' Annex of the Federal, at least three days a week. But
she, who a month ago had been a flying-haired working girl with
gingerbread and an apple for lunch in a flowery pasteboard box, was
now a gray-suited, demurely coiffed young career-woman, and Cass
was heavy with worry and a certain jealousy as he found that she
had no longer to depend on him to meet the Important Factors in the
Commercial and Professional Life of Our City, but was invited to
lunch by Abbott Hubbs, Curtiss Havock, Fred Nimbus, the announcer,
and Dick Wolke, the jeweler. When he met her now, it was as likely
to be she who had the "inside track on the news"&mdash;she called
it that&mdash;news about Norton Trock's extra-legal speculations or
Bernice Claywheel's lovers or the more secret plans of the Turkish
Army.</p>

<p>To his tenderness for her Cass added wondering admiration of her
knowledge. She knew just how much false hair Madge Dedrick wore,
and precisely what plans, in a secluded tent on the African desert,
British agents were making...Hubbs had told her, and Cass mustn't
let it go any further.</p>

<p>She reported all her professional triumphs, and Cass was proud
but worried, as they walked in the chilly September evenings, with
the first of the Northern Lights like a gigantic glass chandelier
swaying in the ceiling of the heavens.</p>

<p>He was in a trance of absolute love, and such practicalities as
marriage seemed trivial. He wanted nothing except what she might
want. His responsibility as a judge, his devotion to his friends,
his zest in hunting and swimming, his reverence for learning, these
must remain in him, for they were indestructible parts of him, but
they were minor and obvious facts, not worth noting, compared with
his worship for this slight, swift-walking girl.</p>

<p>But he did not think of her only in terms of divinity, of altars
and silver wings. He hoarded a bus-transfer ticket that had been
crumpled in her hot hand, a pencil sketch of himself which she had
made on a paper napkin.</p>

<p>The Quiet Mind that he had always sought he had found now in
Jinny's cool presence. She was to him not lovely flesh alone,
though wholesomely and urgently she was that as well, but peace and
reality. With her, he might never accomplish strange adventures,
but with her the commonplace life of a Grand Republic lawyer might
become as beautiful as sunrise on a prairie slew.<br>
<br></p>

<p>The rumor that "Judge Timberlane has fallen for some skirt or
other and is going to get hitched" had spread from Ottawa Heights
to the distant wilderness fully five minutes' drive away, where
dwelt nobody at all except the clerks and factory workers and
repairmen and women and children who made up nine-tenths of the
population of Grand Republic.</p>

<p>Into the mind of everyone who wanted everyone else to do
something beneficial for all the rest of the people and do it right
away came the same inspiration. If Judge Timberlane was going to be
married again, and apparently this time to a tempting little piece
who would keep him absorbed, then he would be less affable about
giving contributions, making speeches, sitting on committees,
signing broadsides, and listening to the local Adam Smiths read
aloud, from mimeographed sheets, their plans to bring about
international peace by having the Lenin Institute of Moscow, the
University of Berlin, and the University of Indiana combine. They
must get to him at once, and if George Hame had not been agile at
the corridor door of the Judge's chambers, they probably would have
done so.</p>

<p>They had to be content with writing to him, though they would
have preferred to bolt in and shout, "I know you're a busy man and
I just want three minutes of your time," and then stay for three
eloquent hours.</p>

<p>Daily Cass had letters from organizations to keep us out of the
war, to get us into the war, to support the labor unions, the
manufacturers' unions, the farmers' unions, and the Dickens
Fellowship, and crusades to glorify the American mother or to
persuade her to stop talking.</p>

<p>He felt guilty about all of them but instead of answering them,
now, he went out to lunch with Jinny.<br>
<br></p>

<p>He had little of her fantastic imagination, whereby, in her
Banner cartoons, Rumania became a sinister cat like her own Isis,
but he nourished that imagination in her, along with every
happiness and tranquility. He looked at her cartoons even before
the European war headlines or the court notices, and when she had
failed, as unfortunately she frequently did, he winced, and prayed
for her success. Oh, yes, he did sometimes pray, to a Liberal
Congregational God who was interested in world peace and the
welfare of share-croppers.</p>

<p>He walked with Jinny, they played poker at Miss
Hatter's&mdash;Tracy Oleson had the astuteness about straights to
be expected from a Wargate Corporation man&mdash;and once, when a
carnival came to town, Cass and Jinny attended it and shot rifles
at clay ducks and had their weights guessed and their photograph
taken, arm in arm.</p>

<p>In the belief that she had enjoyed somewhat rowdy sports like
bowling with Eino and Tracy, Cass conceived it to be his duty to
show himself boisterous, and he rode the merry-go-round with her,
boldly reaching for the brass ring, while the electors of Radisson
County stood in a circle yelling, "Ride 'em, Judge" and "Good boy,
Judge; you got it." He looked triumphantly at Jinny, on a gold and
aquamarine unicorn beside him, but her face was compressed and
disapproving.</p>

<p>He got off the merry-go-round as soon as possible. "I thought
you'd enjoy roughhousing with me," he puzzled.</p>

<p>"It isn't dignified. Nor for a judge."</p>

<p>"But I thought you didn't like it when I was too dignified."</p>

<p>"I don't, but still&mdash;People recognizing you and staring at
you cutting up monkeyshines! Your own constituents!"</p>

<p>"Why, Jinny, I gained five votes for my next election every time
they saw me go round!"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;maybe&mdash;but still&mdash;"</p>

<p>He had thought that in Blanche he had encountered all the
feminine unreasonableness there was to know. The student of
precedents sighed, "Overruled again."</p>

<p>The first occasion on which they were invited out together was a
dinner given by Rose Pennloss, with the playful Zagos, that
glittering semi-bachelor Jay Laverick and, to Cass's quaking, Chris
Grau.</p>

<p>The Pennloss house was as neat as a shop-window and as
comfortable as a hotel and no more affectionate than either. The
living-room, scientifically the right size for a family of three,
was filled with maple reproductions of Colonial furniture, on a
machine-made handmade rug, with a New Art wallpaper depicting, with
liberties, the environs of Boston, all highly clean and shining,
with one relieving vulgarity in a rubbed red-leather couch on which
Don took his naps. The excellent dinner, cooked by the excellent
Swedish maid and served on excellent china that, in a fainting
gray, showed the major churches of New England, tasted as the fine
maple furniture looked.</p>

<p>To Cass, social dinners were likely to be either hellish or
dull. This was hellish.</p>

<p>But Chris Grau, now first coming on Jinny and him as a
recognized couple, was cordial, was easily generous. She asked Cass
about the health of Cleo, and she said to Jinny, "I look at your
cartoons every day, Miss Marshland. I think they are extremely
clever."</p>

<p>As he heard this, Cass suddenly knew that they were not
particularly clever, and he felt bleak.</p>

<p>He kept babbling, and Rose had a sorry tale of how little the
Reverend Dr. Gadd appreciated her spiritual yearnings, and the
Zagos bounced about and waved the stalks of vegetables in the air,
but Jinny was as strong as Chris. She was wordless but merry-eyed,
and she listened to everybody exactly as though she were
listening.</p>

<p>She even kept on smiling when Juliet Zago yelled, "Oh, oopsums,
we dot Baked Alaska for dessertums!"</p>

<p>Rose had thought not badly of Jinny, and looked at her now with
politeness, but she wanted to know quite a few fundamental things
about her religious beliefs, her virtue, her opinion of President
Franklin D. Roosevelt, and how cheaply she could buy clothes.</p>

<p>What, fretted Cass, could any man do against the secret hates
and grudging acceptances of women?</p>

<p>Not cowards in the windy forests of night can find such jumpy
fears as any lover. When dinner was over, Rose's daughter, Valerie,
fifteen and fresh and excited, came in from a movie which she and
the current boy had been professionally viewing and judging. She
clamped on Jinny as the only bright thing in this mildewed company.
The two girls, twenty-four and fifteen, slipped away and could be
heard laughing in the sun-room. When Jinny was dragged back, to
make up the second table of bridge, she looked at Cass sulkily, and
he felt like a wicked old pasha.</p>

<p>He was unreasonably irritated that they expected him to be
grateful to them for accepting as possibly worthy of them the young
Diana clothed in light.<br>
<br></p>

<p><b>An Assemblage of Husbands and Wives</b>
</p>

<p><i>Rose and Don Pennloss</i>
</p>

<p>Cass Timberlane never at any time expected the marriage of his
sister and Don Pennloss to last for three months more. He was
sorry; he liked them both, and in their informal and impersonal
house he was comfortable. But Rose had ambitions for what she
called "a richer life," which meant, to her, music and travel and
new clothes and being the hostess to visiting lecturers, like
Diantha Marl, or living in a New York duplex, like Astra Wargate,
sister-in-law of Webb.</p>

<p>Her husband liked making love to her, liked having her around to
play rummy and hear his stories. The trouble, or so Rose thought,
was that he was common in taste and dull in talk and a small
dreariness to look at. She could not endure the heavy monotone of
his voice; he quarreled or made love or said the bacon was good or
denounced the unions in exactly the same basso, without
inflections.</p>

<p>Don was, at forty, a grain-dealer, president of the Aldpen
Elevator System, and he made nine thousand dollars a year and liked
carpentry, and when you asked him if he didn't think it was a hot
afternoon, he told you. Always, invariably though Rose threatened
to scream, he had a nap on the red leather couch when he came home
from the office, and invariably he announced his purpose by saying,
"I think I'll take a little nap now." Never a large nap. Never a
medium-sized nap. Always a little one. And he snored.</p>

<p>On evenings when they were at home alone, he turned on the radio
and let it blast away through music, weather reports, lumber-market
reports, addresses about South American tariffs, and humorous
sketches in which celebrated radio artists said that their
rivals&mdash; really lovely friends of theirs&mdash;were no good at
all. Don rarely heard any of it, as he read his newspaper and The
Grain Gazette, but if she wanted to turn it off he was angry. He
mourned, "Can't a man do what he wants to even in his own house? I
don't stay out nights chasing around with a bunch of chippies, and
I think I might have some consideration."</p>

<p>Rose frequently told Cass that her liveliest desire was to have
Don "stay out nights and chase his head off and let me have one
quiet evening to think in."</p>

<p>When Rose had married him sixteen years ago&mdash;he was
twenty-four and she was only twenty&mdash;she had reported to Cass,
"Don's really the most appealing boy, under his apparent solidity.
I'm the only one who understands him. He tugs at my
heartstrings."</p>

<p>She complained about Don now rather too much; usually to Cass
but not rarely to an intimate lunch of women at the Heather Club.
But she never complained to her daughter, Valerie, for whom she
planned vicarious careers as an actress or a newspaperwoman.</p>

<p>She said to Cass, in effect, "I want to live in New York and get
to know all the intellectuals. But what is a woman who is still
good-looking at thirty-six but not beautiful enough to make a
career of it, clever enough to know she wouldn't be clever on any
job, aware, through reading, of all the glamor and luxuries of life
but with no money for them and no rich relatives to murder, active
and yet contemptuous of amateur charities and artistic trifling and
exhibitionistic sports, untrained in anything worth fifteen dollars
a week on the labor market and not even, after years of marriage, a
competent cook or nurse, no longer in love with her husband and
bored by everything he does&mdash;and he always does it!&mdash;and
yet unwilling to have the thrill of being vengeful toward him or of
hurting him intentionally, liking other men but not lecherous nor
fond of taking risks, possessing a successful daughter and too
interested in her to desert her&mdash;just what is this typical
upper-middle-middle-class American Wife to <i>do</i>?"</p>

<p>When Cass scolded that she had never yet done anything to prove
that she was really superior to her cheerful and industrious
husband, and that Don might be bored also, Rose agreed so
angelically that Cass felt helpless. And when he insisted that if
she really wanted to break away, she must quit talking, take a
plain job, study, thoroughly learn some occupation, she agreed just
as amiably, and did nothing.</p>

<p>She had once had something like a lover in St. Paul, a musician,
a pretentious fool who finally ran off with a weak-minded
grandmother, but Rose was still proud of having been caressed by
this cavalier. Once, for two weeks, she had thought that she was in
love with the brutal powers of Dr. Roy Drover, but then the doctor
had gone trout-fishing.</p>

<p>She believed that she liked to listen to spirited conversations
between Men of Talent. She asserted that she was "absolutely in awe
of geniuses, like Bernard Shaw and Henry Ford" and that she "got
such a profound thrill from hearing original points of view
expressed." Actually, they never did get expressed when she was
around, because if she asked a deep question, she interrupted the
answer to it as soon as she had thought up another question. Even
the most intellectual exhibit&mdash;say, Norton Trock explaining
bank clearances&mdash;became only a dark background for Rose's
spiritual fireworks.</p>

<p>All of this about Rose Pennioss is true, and none of it is quite
true, because along with her restlessness, which arose from her
feeling that nothing she was doing was important, she was a
kind-hearted and attractive woman and an unjealous mother, who
would, with a sturdier man, have become a good farm-wife. And,
loving Cass, she was willing to believe as strongly as he that in
Jinny Marshland there was a witch-lamp and a knowledge of good and
evil.</p>

<h2>Chapter 18</h2>

<p>This October week, Cass had a wriggling heap of divorces in his
court, along with a good clean burglary and one lively
carnal-knowledge case. He worked late in his chambers or at home,
and all week he did not once see Jinny. Saturday, he went
reluctantly off on what was supposed to be a joyful duck-hunting
stag, at Dr. Drover's log hunting lodge near Lake Vermilion.</p>

<p>"Roy's Retreat" had cost a good many appendectomies for its
varnished logs, its fieldstone fireplace, and many a humble tonsil
had gladly sacrificed itself for the Navajo blankets, the Mexican
pottery, the rack of English shotguns, and the hotel-size
refrigerator.</p>

<p>The six hunters in the party were out on the duck-pass at four
in the morning on the day after their arrival. They set out the
decoys and humped over, shivering, in the rain, watching the bleary
water, the thin tamaracks, as a wet dawn crawled over the swamp of
faded reeds. Dr. Drover had two bottles of brandy with him, and
when they drove back to the lodge for breakfast, at nine, they had
only five mallards, but they had six beautiful jags. Thereafter,
though Roy would occasionally go out and repel some savage duck
that seemed to menace them, they drank and played poker and talked
about women, and not about women in the kitchen or the
polling-booth.</p>

<p>The others were gentler men than Roy; they did not roar and they
liked novels and the theater, yet all of them, except Cass and
Gerald Lent, who had once lived in Europe and who was now the kept
husband and social secretary of Della Wargate Lent, belonged to the
Big Boys, the solid and hearty fellows, contemptuous of tenderness
toward any women except their mothers and their daughters, and
their talk about women, as about taxation, marched with the tread
of infantry on parade.</p>

<p>Though the biggest and by far the strongest among them, Cass
often had an exasperating feeling of inferiority to these virile
captains. Like a small boy among scornful elder brothers, he
babbled things he did not especially want to say, he interrupted
them with uneasy questions that he did not particularly want
answered. He told wavering anecdotes about the court room, and even
during them he thought, "This is a very dull story!" He chattered
about Russia, about Judge Blackstaff, about the way to cook
cabbage, about every small subject that was sacred to him just now
because he had been discussing it with Jinny.</p>

<p>Roy belched, "Oh, shut up, Cass, you're just gossiping. You get
me down. How the hell a pansy like you, that plays the flute and
reads poetry and is nuts about every sixteen-year-old gal that hits
town and even gets chummy with these Farmer-Labor agitators that
want to overthrow the Government&mdash;how come you can still be
the best shot in town is clean beyond me. By God, <i>that's</i>
injustice!"</p>

<p>That was Roy's way of showing his affection&mdash;and of showing
what he really thought.</p>

<p>In their talk of women, Roy and Greg Marl said nothing about
their own wives, and Bradd Criley had none, but Harley Bozard
jeered that his spouse, Karen, was completely frigid, and Marl let
them know how successfully, on a Pullman sleeper, he had seduced
the wife of a college president.</p>

<p>Gerald Lent ruefully reported, "If any of you boys think it's a
cinch to be idle and live on a rich wife like Della, that expects
you to yes her relatives and to get hot at two A.M., I wish you'd
try it. I ever tell you about the time I had a row with her before
I went off to the Arrowhead? When I came home, she'd put all my
pictures and clothes and the chest that I bought in Florence out on
the lawn, in the rain. The meanest job I know of is to be the
little husband in the home, waiting for the big manly wife to come
from work. No ditch-digger earns his keep as hard as I do. I wonder
when I'll walk out on dear Della. She'll be so surprised! Hey,
don't be so tightwad with that hootch."</p>

<p>Through it all the monkish Cass wanted only to repeat the
awfully bright things his Jinny had said.</p>

<p>He dared not even question her employer, Greg Marl, about her
progress as a cartoonist, lest the independent young woman hear of
it and think that he was interfering.</p>

<p>He was certain that these were his good friends and that he was
madly enjoying the drinking and the poker, but when they were all
out on the lake, one day earlier than he had intended to go, he
left a highly perjured note for them and drove back, on a red-gold
Minnesota October afternoon, to Grand Republic&mdash;to Jinny.</p>

<p>On the way, from a booth in a country store, he telephoned to
her, "Starting home&mdash;dine with me tonight?" She was at the
Banner office, where ordinarily she was forbiddingly businesslike,
but now she squealed, "Darling! I didn't expect you till tomorrow.
I'm so glad!"</p>

<p>"I had a fine time hunting with the boys."</p>

<p>"The boys! Grrrr!"</p>

<p>"I thought maybe I never would come home."</p>

<p>"So did I. I was scared."</p>

<p>"Would you really care if I didn't come back?"</p>

<p>"I think I'd just die. No, no, I wouldn't! But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Darling, I'm so&mdash;We dine, then?"</p>

<p>"Of course. Why not?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;you know&mdash;I was afraid you might have a date
with Eino or Tracy or Abbott Hubbs."</p>

<p>"Those brats! And if I did&mdash;so what!"</p>

<p>"You'd break it for me?"</p>

<p>By now, the ardor that in her surprise Jinny had betrayed had
grown more cautious, but she was still friendly as she answered, "I
might think about it, anyway."</p>

<p>"I'll be at Miss Hatter's at seven, then."</p>

<p>"I'll be all ready. Seven sharp."</p>

<p>Which, in Jinny's time-schedule, meant ten minutes past seven,
not very sharp.</p>

<p>But for once, when he drove up she was out on a flimsy sort of
balcony, apparently ready, and she waved to him with a thrilling
"Be right down!"</p>

<p>He then waited, in his car, for seven minutes. Four of them he
devoted to regretfully watching his fervor cool off, and three to
wondering whether she had, upstairs there, some rat of a suitor
whom she did not wish him to see.</p>

<p>As she came out of the covered outside stairway, his rapture
sprang up again, but now it was Jinny who was reasonlessly cool.
She said "Hello" civilly, and nothing more, and slipped around the
car and into it before he could give her his hand.</p>

<p>The fatuous lover fretted, as he drove, "I did miss you so,
Jinny. No fun with the ducks. You miss me?"</p>

<p>"I guess I did. Yes, sure. But I've been awful busy."</p>

<p>He had the sense to be still, on their way to the Unstable, or
to mutter about ducks, a subject devoid (in their case) of
emotional strain, and to tell her that Greg Marl had said, "Good
little draftsman, Jinny, and a good sport in the office."</p>

<p>Jinny glowed with "Oh, did he?" Yet she was morose again when
they faced the excellent whitefish and fried apples at the
Unstable, and our poor friend was no longer wise. He protested,
"What's the trouble, lamb?"</p>

<p>"Trouble? I don't know what you mean by 'trouble'!"</p>

<p>"Well, you're so silent&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Good heavens, can't I ever be quiet a moment without being
accused of being deliberately unpleasant?"</p>

<p>"I didn't say you were unpleasant! I never even thought such
a&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, you certainly looked as if you did."</p>

<p>"Oh, Jinny, dear Jinny, what are you quarreling about?"</p>

<p>"I? Quarreling? Oh, this is too much! I get so irritated when
you watch me and spy on me and try to find fault with every little
thing that I do or don't do and try and show how superior
and&mdash;I <i>do</i>!"</p>

<p>He could only look at her like a mournful hound surprised by the
spitting of his friend the household kitten. Jinny ran down. She
laughed, she cried for a second&mdash;a tear absurdly dribbled down
her immaculate nose&mdash;and she whimpered:</p>

<p>"It's my old trick. You'll have to beat me."</p>

<p>"M."</p>

<p>"When I was a kid, whenever I wanted something terribly and then
got it, so I was all excited and grateful&mdash;like Christmas or a
birthday or finally Mother got a dress for me that I was crazy
about&mdash;then I was scared to let on how happy I was, or maybe I
was afraid it would vanish if I believed in it too hard and showed
how much I wanted it. So I'd fly off into a horrible little
tantrum, and the gladder I'd been, the worse I'd behave. Believe
me, it didn't last long, it never did, and if Dad and Mother could
just get themselves to ignore it, I'd be all right. But it did used
to surprise them and hurt them. And now&mdash;I'm not so violent,
but I'm doing something like that to you, and you're so sweet! I've
been vixenish tonight just because I <i>was</i> glad you'd come
back early! Do you think you can put up with it? I know I'll do it
again. Even to you. Can you endure such a horrible, childish
frenzy?"</p>

<p>Why, of course he could. Meant nothing at all. Just nerves and
tiredness, from all her energy&mdash;Get right over it. Certainly.
Fact, he'd enjoy her tantrums, if she was always so regretful and
generally lovely afterward. And <i>usually</i>, with <i>most</i>
lovers, they didn't just have little misunderstandings like this,
but actually <i>quarreled</i>, didn't they? <i>they</i> were
<i>different!</i></p>

<h2>Chapter 19</h2>

<p>The red maple leaves and the golden poplar among the pines, and
the innocent blue skies that were the autumnal glory of Grand
Republic, were gone. Spring was a season too harsh and swift in
Northern Minnesota; it was the carnival of colored leaves and the
serenity of the long Indian Summer days that the natives of this
land would remember sadly, far off in tired Eastern cities. With
November, the first snows had brought shouting cheerfulness to
children with sleighs and blasphemy to drivers trying to slide
their cars up the slippery roads to Ottawa Heights.</p>

<p>The city hunched its shoulders now to the long winter blast. The
trees that had given a village gentleness to the long streets were
thin and shivering, and the houses were scattered and low, lonely
as the old frontier.</p>

<p>Reviving cocktail parties were gay, at the Wargates', Madge
Dedrick's, the Havocks', the Bozards', but Cass was not often
present. The first scandal of his interest in a Young Outsider had
settled to an accepted routine, but his friends resented more than
ever his neglect of them, felt in it a slighting of the social
glories of their town, about which they were always very emphatic
and very insecure.</p>

<p>When he could not be with Jinny Cass preferred the habitualness
and the validity of his court room, where now the lights came on
early and they were snug and content about their business of
sending people to prison and were not disturbed by the invitation
of green river valleys and the liquid sound of small lake-waves
around a fisherman's scow. Often, after court, he talked for half
an hour with George Hame, the court reporter, who apparently knew
nothing about Jinny, though he had seen her in these chambers, but
who, if he had known, would have assumed that any young thing was
lucky to get the Judge.</p>

<p>Cass saw Jinny daily, and he was disconsolate in discovering
that the course of true love runs in curlicues. He had assumed that
persons so sensible as himself and Jinny would march sweetly and
directly onward from meeting to understanding to an altar and a
beautiful home and six beautiful children all superb in filial
devotion and swimming and arithmetic. With Blanche, the progress
had been straight enough. She had found his attentions flattering;
she had taught him to wear his clothes and his political opinions
well; she had met a richer man; and she had got out. What could be
better charted?</p>

<p>But with Jinny, even his jealousies ran jaggedly.<br>
<br></p>

<p>He was dining with Jinny and Eino Roskinen in a booth at
Shorty's Fountain Cafe. The prospect was of a forest of hats and
overcoats upon a skeleton tree, a woman in dreadful plaid winter
slacks, and a Coca-Cola poster showing a nearly naked bathing
girl&mdash;the Folk Art of America. They were taking the Blue Plate
Dinner: a pork chop with apple sauce and French-fried potatoes and
string beans made of wood pulp, though afterward they indulged in
"pie a la mode," pie crowned with a hard little knob of ice cream.
It was an abominable meal and a criticism on their whole
civilization, but Eino the torch-bearer did not, for once, perceive
this as well as the cautious judge.</p>

<p>Cass had wanted to treat these boarding-house starvelings to
what was here called a T-bone steak, but they had refused his
patronage. He was trying so hard to be one with them. Eino now
called him "Cass," and the Judge winced every time he heard it,
though it was he who had suggested it. To be youthful and chummy,
he offered a few remarks on football, which apparently bored them,
and on the fallacies of religion, which they dismissed as too
elementary for their advanced revolutionary standing.</p>

<p>Well, he had done his social duty, and he fell to musing,
thinking of an ethereal and more-than-human girl named Jinny, who
was far off somewhere and with whom he longed to be, flinging jests
like rainbow-hued balls of glass, reverently kissing her flawless
hands...Meanwhile he looked absently at the ink-spot on one thin
paw of Miss Marshland of the Grand Republic Banner.</p>

<p>He came out of his reverie to find that they were talking about
the local Little Theater, the Masquers.</p>

<p>"You ought to <i>make</i> time for it, this winter, Jinx," Eino
was commanding. "Personally I can't act&mdash;I'm too much the
intellectual type&mdash;but you have an energetic fakery that would
make you a swell actress."</p>

<p>Cass fumed that she did not resent this, but let him go on. "Let
me tell you the theater could be the greatest instrument for the
implementation of social ideals that the world has ever known. If
you'd quit sketching a little and reading a little and really go to
work and try for a part in the Masquers, you might accomplish
something."</p>

<p>"Eino! Do you honestly think I could act?"</p>

<p>"Well, I'd coach you."</p>

<p>&mdash;He would, would he? Aah!</p>

<p>&mdash;Is she already going back to that Eino? I suspect she was
pretty fond of him when I came along, and then I was a novelty! A
respectable lawyer prancing around making a comic spectacle of
himself over a girl young enough to be his&mdash;Well, she
<i>could</i> be my daughter, if I'd started begetting at sixteen.
Perfectly possible. Curse it!</p>

<p>&mdash;Sure. I merely offer her whatever dignities I may have,
along with all my adoration, and she flies off with the first tom
fool that guffaws at her&mdash;</p>

<p>&mdash;Now that's unfair. She knew him some time before she ever
knew me, and anyway, she's merely a loyal friend of his, and he's a
fine, hard-working young&mdash;</p>

<p>&mdash;Does he have to keep on making that horrible noise,
tapping on the table with that crowbar of a finger?<br>
<br></p>

<p>When the children remembered that their Venerable Friend was
still present and tried to cheer up the poor old codger by giving
him the news that it had been cold today, he wanted to convince
them that he was still alive by croaking that, yes, it had been
quite cold&mdash; for November, that is&mdash;and he had noticed it
all by himself.</p>

<p>(It had not, by the way, been particularly cold.)</p>

<p>Having thus done their duty by the nonagenarian and having given
a talented new actress to the stage, the happy young couple turned
to more personal confidences. They said that Tracy Oleson was
getting to be as much of a stuffed shirt as Webb Wargate himself,
but they&mdash; they would just get off in corners and laugh about
it. They illustrated, by laughing.</p>

<p>It was part of their creed and time that every so often Eino and
Jinny should say to each other, "What's cooking?" and that they
should show reverence for jazz and familiarity with such
contemporary maestri as Benny Goodman and Peewee Russell. Cass
hoped Eino would never learn that he sometimes, in a melancholy and
amateurish way, tried to play Purcell airs on his flute. This
practice he had begun in college vacations, and it had been
extraordinarily ill received by Roy Drover.</p>

<p>Jinny (or so Judge Timberlane believed) smiled guiltily at Eino
while she adjusted the straps of her brassiere&mdash;known at this
time as a "brazeer," or, coyly, as a "bra." But he insisted that it
was not Jinny who was damp and treacherous. She was innocent, but
this Roskinen was a wolf.</p>

<p>By God, he would protect this child, toward whom he himself had
no intentions save to teach her chess! If Eino thought for one
moment that he wasn't suspected&mdash;</p>

<p>Eino was on his feet, saying with amiable brevity that he'd
enjoyed his dinner&mdash;leave you two capitalists to wallow in the
movies&mdash; g'night. Then Jinny was clawing at Cass like an angry
Cleo:</p>

<p>"Cass, my dear young brainless baby, I have never in all my life
seen such an exhibition of childish jealousy!"</p>

<p>"Me?"</p>

<p>"You, Honorable Timberlane, you!"</p>

<p>"But I disapprove of&mdash;I detest jealousy!"</p>

<p>"Then you detest yourself. The way you kept glaring at Eino,
contradicting everything he said, but not decently, with words, but
with that horrible sniffy silence! And when I yanked at my
shoulder-straps, you put on such a production of goggling at me and
then Eino that the poor lamb was thunderstruck. And this after he's
given up all claim on me! I'm simply not going to stand for such
insane jealousy!"</p>

<p>"Jinny! I didn't know I was. Maybe you're right. I'm
profoundly&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And all over poor Eino! Now if you'd pick out my editor, Mr.
Hubbs, to be jealous over&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hubbs? He, too?"</p>

<p>"Oh, very much too. He's what we call in the office a sweetie
pie."</p>

<p>Impishly, she waited for him to vomit over the phrase, but he
was being too seriously appalled that he should be another of the
jealous lovers who brought so much poison into his court. He
muttered, "So I really seemed jealous?"</p>

<p>"And how! And when you consider that I almost never see Eino any
more. His mother has moved into town, and they've taken a shack
together, and he just drops in at Hatter's to see Tracy and
Lyra&mdash; not me. The fact is&mdash;" She wrinkled with a new
worry as she went on. "I don't see enough of him, or the rest of my
old bunch, either, not even Lyra. I'm so much at the office, and
evenings I'm likely to be out with you. And you actually jealous of
those eager kids! I've drifted away from them shamefully. I give
you all my time, and then you humiliate me by this jealousy. Oh,
Cass, I can't stand it, if you're going on like this!"</p>

<p>"My dear, I'm all humbleness. I hadn't realized it. I have only
the old excuse that my jealousy is the measure of my devotion to
you&mdash;and of my insecurity with you. If we were really engaged,
if I could only be sure that I had you to do things for, then maybe
I wouldn't be so uncertain and so jealous."</p>

<p>"But I still don't see how you can be so touchy, and 'suspect me
of the worst'&mdash;whatever that means."</p>

<p>"And I don't see how you can endure driving me plain
mad&mdash;and ridiculous&mdash;by leaving me so baffled. But no
matter; even if you do, I won't be jealous. And don't tell me again
that jealousy is an insult to you. I know it is! So&mdash;I'm
cured."</p>

<p>"Are you?"</p>

<p>"I think so&mdash;maybe."</p>

<p>They could laugh slightly, and everything was settled, and with
entirely unconscious jealousy he got her talking about this new
menace, this scoundrel, Abbott Hubbs.</p>

<p>She, it appeared, was sorry that Mr. Hubbs drank so much, and
she believed that his wife was not gentle enough with him. It also
seemed that an Important Person in Washington had asserted that Mr.
Hubbs was competent to take charge of any newspaper in Chicago or
New York. Most devastating of all, Mr. Hubbs&mdash;he had such a
sense of humor&mdash;cut paper dolls out of the exchanges and
presented them to Jinny, who had one of them in her purse this
moment, along with Isis.</p>

<p>To Cass, it looked like a very bad paper doll. It looked like a
piece of newspaper which had been chewed by a puppy of imperfect
intelligence.</p>

<p>He said that Hubbs was a "splendid fellow and very brainy" and
that the paper doll was of unique charm. Blessedly, then, they quit
that quest for perfection in each other which is the maddening
glory of all true love, and they did a very fine game with
matches&mdash; you make six triangles with eight matches, only you
never do. He stroked her hand, soft tan against the red-rubber
tabletop, and they went arm in arm off to the movies.<br>
<br></p>

<p>That night, gravely rubbing Cleo's spine, he told himself that
jealousy was the meanest of sicknesses and most contemptible of
prides.</p>

<p>Having delivered before himself an address which would have
adorned any Bar Association dinner, Cass became rather sorry for
this lonely judge, still young, able to love with angelic
selflessness, yet kept waiting like a servant by an opinionated
young woman with shameless scarlet finger-nails.</p>

<p>Then&mdash;some time in his dizzy changes of opinion he must
have pulled Cleo's hair, for she yowled and leaped and
fled&mdash;he fell upon himself for this desecration. No! Jinny was
the true goddess, perfect in every part, under law of the miracle
whereby a woman who is completely lovely of face is lovely also in
skin and limbs and shoulders and voice and walk. She was the
divinity inviolable, to say nothing of being a very exciting young
woman who said such clever things, and sometimes was a grieved and
frightened little girl who broke his heart by her helplessness
against the vicious world.</p>

<p>Then, by a descent into hell too swift to have been marked:</p>

<p>&mdash;Of course she's all that. But.</p>

<p>&mdash;But does she have to fall for every heel she meets? She
specializes in heels. First this philandering Little Theater hound
and that statistical Tracy Oleson lout, and now this third-rate
dipsomaniac, Hubbs.</p>

<p>&mdash;Oh, quit thinking in circles! To say nothing of its being
a crime against your love for her, which is the one splendor in
your whole mechanical, law-grubbing existence.</p>

<p>&mdash;But do Eino and she make fun of me and laugh at me when
they're by themselves? Do they consider me a solemn owl trying to
be a lark? How they must talk and giggle!</p>

<p>&mdash;Dear Jinny, my beloved, forgive me for loving you better
than I can!<br>
<br></p>

<p>All the next morning, in court, while he was listening to the
horror of a woman who had killed her own baby, he kept fighting off
a vicious little plan to drop in at the Banner office and see how
Jinny and Abbott Hubbs acted when they were together. The testimony
of the frightened woman burned away all the cheapness of his plan,
and he wondered that his self, which mostly he respected, could be
so sneaking. On his way to lunch, he saw Hubbs on the street: tall,
anemic, moving jerkily. He thought of him, working hard, drinking
hard to keep going, watched always with a friendly distrust by that
bland Olympian, Gregory Marl.</p>

<p>Then all the sickness of jealousy was gone from him&mdash;for a
while.</p>

<h2>Chapter 20</h2>

<p>When the November snows had halted automobile wanderings, they
began a placid habit of evenings at Bergheim. Sometimes Jinny
brought Isis along and set her where she could watch. To Cass, this
affection for the tiny glass cat was no sillier than Egyptian rites
in which Jinny might have been a little wise priestess, her thin
hands elevated in prayer to feline mysteries, in the ancient haze
of the Nile.</p>

<p>Mrs. Higbee adopted Jinny, and one evening Cass heard them as
they explored the upstairs, conferring on what should be done for
Him.</p>

<p>"Do you ever have French toast for His breakfast?" suggested
Jinny.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, He likes any kind of sweets. He isn't a heavy eater,
you might say, but the way He can shovel in the griddle cakes!"</p>

<p>"We ought to take more care of His health. He's always carrying
on about His hunting and tennis and swimming, but wintertime, He
sticks His nose in a book and never gets out."</p>

<p>"Don't I know it, Miss Jinny!...You, Cleo, you get out from
under my feet. What you want to do? Trip me up?...I say to Him at
breakfast, I say, 'Judge, aren't you ashamed of yourself, big
strong young fellow like you, sitting and reading, read all the
time, all those big thick books, and not get out for exercise 'cept
summer?' But Lord, I can't do anything with Him. I'll keep Him nice
and clean and well fed inside the house, but you got to drag Him
out on walks."</p>

<p>"I will, too. Gracious, this bedroom of His is gloomy! I'd like
to see it all in maple, with blue curtains."</p>

<p>"Looks like He likes it gloomy. I guess judges don't get fun,
like you and me."</p>

<p>"I'll educate Him!"</p>

<p>Downstairs, Cass listened blissfully.</p>

<p>He had at first been fretted by the thought of Jinny's presence
raising scandal among all the John William Prutts and peeping
telephonic widows, but they were so natural and serene and domestic
as they sat reading in the small, pipe-scented library that he
forgot such alien dangers. He inquired whether she would not rather
go out dancing, drinking, and she had to instruct him:</p>

<p>"I don't want to go racketing around all the time. If I really
wanted to go out with these young punks, I'd go. It's just as
exciting to find all these books here: The Golden Bough and August
Derleth. Oh, don't <i>insist</i> on my being discontented! I can do
that so easy by myself. Sweet blessed angel, will you quit your
worrying?</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;oh&mdash;sorry&mdash;yes!"</p>

<p>&mdash;Trying to make her more contented than contentment
itself! That's all a piece with the jealousies I used to feel.
Thank God <i>that's</i> cured!</p>

<p>&mdash;This profession of being a true lover. Can any one master
it? That must be God's most sublime joke on the human race; that
the more you want to make a woman happy, the more you blunder and
bore her.</p>

<p>&mdash;Do you remember that Judge Timberlane being profound
about matrimony in his chambers? And spinsters and unwed priests
giving advice about it. Marriage and the common cold&mdash;the two
persistent problems of mankind and the ones that have never been
solved.</p>

<p>&mdash;Lovely Jinny, sitting there with your tongue in the
corner of your mouth, reading Death Comes for the Archbishop and
looking like such a wise child, and all the while more devastating
and terrible than war.</p>

<p>&mdash;One thing I do get clear about her. She is one of those
extraordinary people who are not willing to settle down and wait
for death, willing to play cards and yawn and gossip and actually
speak of 'killing time,' when we have so little time. What life she
has she will always live.</p>

<p>Unconscious of the lecture about her, the girl softly closed the
book, slid to the hearth, and curled beside Cleo while Cass's
meditations ticked on:</p>

<p>&mdash;You baby! Not so much bigger than Cleo, and yet all the
while I see you as the eternal Pilgrim. My beloved, can't there be
one husband and wife in history whom Time will spare for a moment
and who will defeat the worm? Dear Jinny, I wonder if you hear
me?</p>

<p>"Cass! You're smiling so tenderly. Are you thinking of something
pleasant?"</p>

<p>"Well, something important, anyway."</p>

<p>"Like candy-bars? Or a high dive?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but with a touch of flaming wings."</p>

<p>"Sounds ingenious. Oh golly, I'm tired. I'm going home to bed,
my pet."</p>

<p>"Nice words: home and bed. But rarely any flaming wings to
'em."</p>

<p>"Are we as mysterious as we sound?"</p>

<p>"Jinny, we are the most mysterious and frightening things in the
world: a man and a woman of whom at least one is in love...Jin,
does it scare you to hear the word death?"</p>

<p>"Never! I can't die&mdash;not for sixty years at least."</p>

<p>The little cat meowed pitifully at their feet.<br>
<br></p>

<p>When he had driven her home and returned to his library, he saw
that she had forgotten to take Isis with her. On a bookshelf the
trinket shone in firelight, now diamond-flashing, now ruby, until
as he stood there in his rustic coonskin coat and sealskin hat, he
was hypnotized and saw a gigantic crystal cave in whose ice-glaring
maw crouched a little figure, half-naked, sobbing, terrified by
night and death.</p>

<h2>Chapter 21</h2>

<p>Boyish and open-faced, blond and wavy-haired, a controlled
drinker, a careful but quick-minded lawyer, Cass's old friend Bradd
Criley was a pleasant fellow as well as the most valued
dinner-guest and bridge-partner in Grand Republic. He was a
bachelor, and he never toyed with any woman over forty nor with any
girl under eighteen&mdash; unless he was sure he would not be found
out. He said to men, "I'm sorry, but I've been so busy" and to
women, "You're so beautiful tonight." He said, possibly he
believed, that Cass was the soundest judge on the Minnesota
bench.</p>

<p>He came snowily in one evening when Cass was giving Jinny a
lesson in chess; he insisted on reading till the game was finished;
and afterward, as they talked, they three became a firm trio.</p>

<p>With his skillful teasing, he brought out from Jinny her
opinions on immortality and Gregory Marl&mdash;neither quite
favorable&mdash;and he made them laugh with his stories of the
great, somber, dumb Wargate Family, which his firm, Beehouse,
Criley, and Anderson represented. Jinny popped corn for them,
pretty and flushed as she knelt by the fireplace, and brought cider
from the kitchen, and faintly sang a cradle song. Bradd, when he
left them together, shook hands with Cass and said in his frank,
fresh voice, "Your Honor, I submit that you two are the nicest
family in Radisson County."</p>

<p>Next day, at the Club, he continued: "Cass, when are you going
to marry this girl? Let me tell you: if you don't, I will!"</p>

<p>"I'm crazy to. But she's turned me down flat."</p>

<p>"Nonsense. Keep asking her. I can see she's crazy about you and
comfortable with you. Naturally&mdash;she's still a kid&mdash;she
wants to show some independence."</p>

<p>"You don't think she's too young for me?"</p>

<p>"No! Got a wise head on her lovely shoulders. Ask her, boy.
You'll get a reversal of the previous verdict. But if you don't get
busy&mdash;I'll give you three months, and if you haven't got her
pledged then, I'm in the ring. I would be now, but I haven't a
chance. She thinks you're a solid investment and I'm a flash
gold-stock. Wonder how she guessed!"</p>

<p>Bradd's encouragement roused him.<br>
<br></p>

<p>Winter night at Bergheim, a northwest wind driving spears of
snow from Dakota and Saskatchewan, and in the library, Cass and
Jinny toasting and serene.</p>

<p>He laid down his Life of Lord Birkenhead and spoke plain:</p>

<p>"That's the sixth cigarette you've smoked this evening,
Jin."</p>

<p>"Oh yas?"</p>

<p>"How many do you smoke a day?'</p>

<p>"I dunno. Twenty, maybe."</p>

<p>"How long have you smoked?"</p>

<p>"Since I was seven."</p>

<p>"M?"</p>

<p>"Cornsilk. In the Marshland barn."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll try not to nag. I'm not much of a reformer. I admire
revolutionists more than I do reformers. The greatest reformer
living is Mr. Hitler, who is trying to reform all Europe. But
still&mdash;Jinny, you have such fresh lips."</p>

<p>"That's Higgins's Sans Merci lipstick."</p>

<p>"Nonsense. I've kissed you when your lips were damp and bare
after we'd been swimming. Such sensitive lips and such a clear
throat and sound lungs&mdash;I hate to see 'em messed up, hate to
see you spoil 'em just for an unconvincing pose of being
worldly."</p>

<p>"Maybe I will cut 'em now&mdash;maybe."</p>

<p>"Come sit on my lap."</p>

<p>She did not, as once, roost there awkwardly, but lay gently
against him, one hand holding his lapel, while he urged:</p>

<p>"Now this is a trial. You are judge and I'm the defendant
<i>and</i> his attorney. Now Your Honor, I represent the man
Timberlane, a lout and slow-witted, but fervently in love with
you."</p>

<p>"With the judge? Why, Cass!"</p>

<p>"Now play fair."</p>

<p>"Okay, Counselor. Is this the accused that I see? Does he have
to stand so close? Let me look at him. No. He doesn't look so slow,
and I'm not too certain about his fervor. After all my experience
on the bench, I'd say he was just in love with the picture of
himself as a lover."</p>

<p>"No, the fellow is not a romantic. He really thinks about what
his young woman wants."</p>

<p>"His what?"</p>

<p>"All right, all right, monkey! His inamorata. His sweet lamb.
His perambulatory dream. His virgin immaculate. His princess of the
dark tower, and stormy as sunset were her lips, a stormy sunset on
doomed ships, and she gathers all things mortal with pale immortal
hands and she does not walk in the fields with gloves. His tragic
fate, tortuous as the River Vye. His&mdash;Oh, Jinny, I'm afraid I
have to be serious. You know that I love you utterly."</p>

<p>Her arms gently circled his neck, but after a selfless quiet she
sat up on his knee, a hand on each of his shoulders, mocking and
combative again.</p>

<p>"I still say I'm not sure you know what you want, Cass."</p>

<p>"I want to see you at breakfast, fresh in gingham."</p>

<p>"Nobody wears gingham any more, and at breakfast, before coffee,
I really <i>am</i> a stormy sunset on doomed ships. Ships run for
Port Arthur when they see me dooming at breakfast. So that's out.
What else?"</p>

<p>"I want to be able to come home from court and tell you how
swell I was; how my rulings stood 'em in the aisle."</p>

<p>Children of their earthy land and revolutionary time, flippant
and colloquial and compelled to nervous banter, they were yet in a
noble tradition of lovers, and there was more of tragic prince than
of smug clown in his airy demand; and it was Ruth amid most alien
corn who answered:</p>

<p>"I think you got something there."</p>

<p>Then he was grave. "And I want children." Blanche had been
afraid of bearing children and she had always "put it off a while
yet&mdash; till the right time." Cass demanded, almost mournfully,
"Do you want babies, Jin?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I love them."</p>

<p>"I'm glad. And I want to travel with you."</p>

<p>"I see. But not to kiss me."</p>

<p>He answered that.</p>

<p>"Well, I just wanted to make sure," she explained.</p>

<p>"But I haven't asked what the things are you want, and whether I
can give any of 'em to you, Jinny."</p>

<p>She was silent, then: "I'm afraid you'll learn I'm one of these
changelings that can only give things to herself. I'm fond of you
and grateful to you for liking me, but I have to travel by myself,
for a while anyway. Maybe some day I can come back to you...The cat
that walks by herself, and she does get lonely in the night woods,
but she has to see every shadow for herself and not be told by
anyone what it's the shadow of&mdash;tree or bear or hunter or
maybe a ghost&mdash;shadow of a ghost. I have to look for
myself."</p>

<p>His "Darling!" was a sound of helplessness.</p>

<p>Then, so suddenly that it was almost pain, not joy to him, she
said, "But that doesn't mean that I may not marry you, before long,
and go away now and then and come back to you when the woods get
too scary."</p>

<p>Arm around his neck again, she kissed him voluntarily, and on
that there walked into the room Mr. John William Prutt, Mrs.
Henrietta (Mrs. J. W.) Prutt, and their sound filial investments
Mr. Jack Prutt and Miss Margaret Prutt, with ten thousand ancestral
shades of correct and banking Prutts in superb gray Pruttery behind
them.</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Mr. Prutt.</p>

<p>"Your maid didn't explain&mdash;" said Mrs. Prutt.</p>

<p>Mr. Jack Prutt whistled.</p>

<p>Cass had felt Jinny's body stiffen as she prepared to leap from
his lap, but when the Prutts had spoken, she relaxed and stayed
where she was, indolent and insolent, throbbing with laughter.</p>

<p>The Prutts bumped rigidly out. Cass put Jinny gently on her
feet&mdash; fairly gently&mdash;and rushed after them to the hall,
coughing, "We're engaged, you know...You know...Engaged."</p>

<p>Mrs. Prutt said reverently, "But alone? In your house? At night?
Unchaperoned? Strange, Judge."</p>

<p>"Very strange, I should think," said Mr. Prutt, and they were
gone.</p>

<p>Mrs. Higbee was wailing, "They walked by me like I was dirt,
while I was trying to say, 'The master's in there kissing his
girl.' Just walked by me!"</p>

<p>"Nev' mind," hastened Cass, and galloped into the library, where
Jinny stood fist-clenched and angry.</p>

<p>"I knew it all the time! I should never have come to your house!
I'll never be alone with you again. Oh, I don't blame you,
especially, Cass, but I never shall again!"</p>

<p>"But if you're going to marry me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'll never marry you! Don't ever speak of it again!" She was in
a panic, reasonless but overwhelming. Not for the first time had
Pruttery been too powerful for a child of light.</p>

<p>"Sit on my lap again for a moment and quiet down and then I'll
drive you home."</p>

<p>"No! No! I don't want you to. I'll take a bus."</p>

<p>He had to use all the arts of the legal chambers to quiet her,
to say "Now stop it!" as though he knew professional mysteries that
she could never understand, before he coaxed her into his car. All
the way to Miss Hatter's he was awaiting the verdict of death to
love. On the boarding-house step she said, "I guess this is
good-bye forever. I don't think I shall see you again."</p>

<p>"Jinny!"</p>

<p>"Really."</p>

<p>"I won't take that. To say good-bye to you is to say good-bye to
life."</p>

<p>She was clear and a bit sardonic: "You're the great legal star.
You'll get along all right. You always have."</p>

<p>"If the legal star has to go on shining by John William Prutt's
permission, then I'll chuck starring and everything else except
being with you."</p>

<p>"You mean you'd give up being a judge for me, if you ever had
to?"</p>

<p>"I certainly do."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't want you to. Good night."</p>

<p>She was gone.</p>

<p>He knew that hers was not merely the perverse rudeness of a
lover. He had an excellent chance of losing her. Blanche had been
right; he should never have let himself be baked into a pie of
Pruttery and Roy Drover's intolerance and the generous avidity of
Chris and the Avondenes. The springtime days of companionship with
Jinny were past, and he was afraid that she would never again come
to bring April light into his dark old house.<br>
<br></p>

<p><b>An Assemblage of Husbands and Wives</b>
</p>

<p><i>Gillian Brown &mdash; Violet Crenway</i>
</p>

<p>Gillian Brown was a business woman, a career woman, but she was
human, and she had decided that for such a premature phenomenon as
herself, there were but five matrimonial choices: to marry a man
who was her superior and who would either cheat her or leave her
flat, to marry an inferior whom she would pet and despise, to marry
an equal, which would happen only by a miracle comparable to Jonah
and his also undependable marine companion, to lie unwed and rigid,
or to have company. She had tried all five. The last seemed the
most reasonable now, in the 1940's, when she was assistant manager
of Harley Bozard's shop for women's clothes, on Chippewa Avenue,
Grand Republic.</p>

<p>With her men, some half-dozen of them, she was good-natured,
tolerant of drunks up to a point, but scientific about finding out
when that point had been reached. She made coffee for them, and she
lent them an electric razor of the very best brand.</p>

<p>Gillian Brown, Mrs. St. George Brown, had been christened Mabel
Chiddy, in White River Junction, Vermont, in 1898. She was the
composite portrait of half the American Career Women. She wore
smart suits with lace-trimmed blouses, her hair looked young, and
so did her face, as far down as her mouth. She broadcast a weekly
fashion report on Station <i>kich</i>, and her voice was liquid
chocolate, lazy and lenient, except when a salesgirl had talked
back to her, or after she had had five drinks. Then it was liquid
brass.</p>

<p>She was ambitious, and her ambition was to make enough money to
buy a horsy country place near Chicago, next-door to a gentleman
farmer who would look like an English colonel and would fall in
love with her, permanently, not just on option. Then she would
become "normal and domestic."</p>

<p>The store was open on Saturdays, except in August, and on
Saturday evenings she got drunk, but only introductorily, with The
Girls, business women of her own fate. On Sunday mornings she lay
and sighed that she would never have her country estate or her
Colonel. On Sunday afternoons she got drunk in mixed company, and
preferred to sing "Dixie." On Sunday night she brought a
male&mdash;almost any male, and chosen as often out of pity for his
being starved as out of her own simple passions&mdash;home to her
orderly flat, which was touchingly feminine in its china figurines
of cats and lambs and Columbines.</p>

<p>In her bathroom were forty-three kinds of cosmetics. Many of
them, she knew from selling them, were useless, but she liked the
bottles. But she was always careful to get them wholesale.</p>

<p>She was shrewd, and preferred to be honest, and with equal
reverence she read Catholic, Christian Science, and Unitarian
magazines, 1890 novels about the indignantly virtuous daughters of
widows, and treatises on playing the stock-market.</p>

<p>She admitted to having been married and divorced twice, and
boasted of having lived in New York for three years and Paris for
three weeks. Actually, she had gone through the valley of
matrimonial humiliation three times, but the first had been to and
from an aging Vermont farmer, when she was Mabel Chiddy and only
seventeen.</p>

<p>Her latest attempt to escape had been St. George Brown, a
Brooklyn dress-salesman, whom she was still supporting. She had
helped to support all three of her husbands, and though they had
varied from small and tidy to lank and furrowed, they belonged to
the same pattern: they were all weak and fond of cards and liquor
and they all held their heads sidewise.</p>

<p>She despised two things in women: taking alimony, which she
regarded as a form of looting the conquered city, and the pretense
that you are going to satisfy a man without intending to go through
with it.</p>

<p>Therefore, though she associated with them, drank and snickered
with them, she detested two women in Grand Republic: Sabine
Grossenwahn, divorced niece of Boone Havock, whose
Louisiana-plantation-style bungalow was known as "Alimony Hall,"
and Violet Crenway, Mrs. Thomas Crenway.</p>

<p>Violet was as luscious and perfumed as her name, fetching of eye
and uncommonly white of skin. She was renowned for raising funds
for noble institutions: St. Anselm's Church, the Red Cross, the
Salvation Army, the Republican Women's League. She went into men's
private offices, wearing white gloves and a gardenia, looking
around intently and panting a little, and the men sent their
stenographers away and pushed a chair out for Violet and stood
beside it. She came out with the gloves, the gardenia, the funds,
and her virtue all intact, leaving the men surprised and
blasphemous.</p>

<p>She said that she did adore men, the dear funny things, but
wasn't it amazing, their masculine vanity and the way they thought
that every Girl who smiled at them expected to be kissed! She
boasted that she could come nearer to being kissed without any
casualties than any woman since Delilah&mdash;though in the
comparison she did not mention Delilah but Joan of Arc.</p>

<p>Gillian Brown said that she was interested in being with Violet
Crenway because she was the most evil woman in town, and said that
among the men whom Violet teased was Mr. Thomas Crenway, and Mr.
Crenway did not like it.</p>

<p>Gillian had reason to know how Tom felt about such things</p>

<h2>Chapter 22</h2>

<p>Two days after the army of the Prutts had landed and devastated
the coast, Judge Stephen Douglas Blackstaff came into Cass's
chambers after court.</p>

<p>"Cass, I have been listening to that banker fellow, Prutt,
expiring of sunburn from his blushes of modesty on the telephone.
He's a fool, but he is a symptom. A rustle of scandal is beginning
to follow you. Son, you and I are both men of the world&mdash;from
a strictly Calvinistic point of view, of course&mdash;but we are
also lawyers, and we both know that there must never be any shadow
of scandal over the judicial office. Do you care so much for this
girl that I've seen you with? Would you rather resign than lose
her?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I would, Steve."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, son. Absolute mongery. Why the devil don't you marry
the girl?"</p>

<p>"Why don't I?" Why <i>don't</i> I? Because she's refused me.
Twice."</p>

<p>"My esteemed Rhoda refused me almost continuously, over a period
of two years. She refused me on Rye Beach, she refused me in the
Brothers and Linonia Library of Yale College, and refused me once
during a communion service&mdash;somewhat abruptly, I thought. But
still I triumphed&mdash;at least, that's the accepted theory. Cass,
you're a good young man. Don't risk your honor and the honor of the
State for a sentimental fancy! People are sometimes evil, and they
are not going to believe that you could not marry this young woman
if you desired, and if nothing will make her wed you, there have
always been the soundest precedents for consigning her to the
devil."</p>

<p>Judge Blackstaff's long and rigid back completed his admonition,
and Cass sat wondering whether for Jinny, that lightly dancing
figure on a fan, he would really give up his judicial
dignities.</p>

<p>Yes, he would, if he must do so to guard one higher
dignity&mdash;plain humanity. He had no right more imperious than
to be with his girl, married or not, and for this he would
certainly resign, at need. He had reached this uncomfortable
resolution when Jinny herself, not knocking, came flying into his
chambers; and before he had planned what to say, he had sprung up,
he had kissed her, and she was sobbing:</p>

<p>"Cass! I've lost my job!"</p>

<p>"Oh no!"</p>

<p>"I didn't think I ever could. I was so proud&mdash;the girl
cartoonist!"</p>

<p>"What&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mr. Marl fired me. For incompetence. I wish it could have been
for drunkenness or bigamy. I did so want to be independent, and I
thought I was such a whiz&mdash;everybody said they liked my
cartoons, and I thought they were all looking for them in the
paper. I was so busy, and I was enjoying it, like a fool, and Mr.
Marl called me in and first he said Mrs. Marl and he wanted me to
come to dinner, all by myself&mdash;was I ever proud! Then he asked
me how come I didn't have a cartoon ready for day-before-yesterday.
I hadn't been able to get a good idea, and I'd ruined two drawings.
Then he said he'd already hired a new hand from Minneapolis and he
was so sorry, so awful sorry, but I was through. So now I'll go
back to the factory and eat dirt. I was so proud and silly and now
I'm all washed up&mdash;"</p>

<p>She was weeping, against his shoulder.</p>

<p>As George Hame entered the chambers, Cass said to her, "Now
you're going to marry me."</p>

<p>"Am I? Maybe."<br>
<br></p>

<p>Judge Blackstaff said, yes, it would be a little inconvenient to
have Judge Timberlane away from court during mid-term, even for a
honeymoon. "But," said the senior judge, "it will be a noble
inconvenience." He patted Cass's shoulder. "Son, I am glad that you
thought my advice over and decided to take it. I may no longer be
the sprightly beau I once was, but you see now that I understand
women."</p>

<p>"Oh, thoroughly, Stephen."</p>

<p>"By the way, my boy, take a Bible on your honeymoon. You
yourself may not read it extensively, but it may implant some ideas
in the pliable mind of your bride. I assure you that it is full of
the most admirable advice to females to be thrifty, industrious,
chaste, and <i>silent</i>. One of the most useful books to
husbands. And whenever I travel I find it much safer to take some
pulverized coffee."</p>

<p>The Jinny whom Cass had expected to want only an informal
wedding, with the mayor officiating and Eino and Tracy racketing
around and beer and melody afterward, demanded a formal affair,
with all the clergy, trains, white flowers, unreconstructed
relatives, and champagne available. Cass was touched by the thought
that she did not intend to come into the heraldic haughtiness of
Ottawa Heights by the back door. She was so small and alone, and
the Prutts so large and firm and multifarious. All right. His fairy
princess should come in with as large and brassy a band as he could
muster.</p>

<p>But again he felt, "I can't go on carrying everything alone. I
must have someone to help me." He turned to his sister Rose and to
Mrs. Higbee. He was not worried about the attitude of Cleo; he felt
that she would be for anything that brought gaiety and
ribbon-trailing and mouse-fetching cake into the somber house.</p>

<p>He sat gravely at the oilcloth-covered kitchen table, with Mrs.
Higbee seated across, and urged, "I hope you'll be happy with Miss
Jinny here."</p>

<p>"Judge, would you like me to quit, so I won't get in her
way?"</p>

<p>"Good Lord, no! She loves you, same as I do. The question is
whether <i>you'll</i> be happy."</p>

<p>"Very. A lot of bosses never think of it, but a house is a
servant's <i>home</i>. I couldn't imagine myself anywheres else,
but sometimes it has been lonely. I'll be real pleased to have her
here, and that quick way she walks, almost runs, around the place.
I hope I ain't intruding if I say it's grieved my heart sometimes
to see you poking around so lonely. I prayed about it in church."
She laughed. "I hope the Lord consulted you to see if it was all
right, before He sent Miss Jinny in answer to my prayer!"</p>

<p>"Yes, He consulted me. Thank you for Miss Jinny."</p>

<p>"Well, she was about the best I noticed around this
town&mdash;of course it isn't a very big place."</p>

<p>"That's so."<br>
<br></p>

<p>While Jinny was in as much of an orgy of dressmaking as any
Wargate, Cass nervously conferred with Rose about "redoing the
house."</p>

<p>"Leave it to Jinny," she said.</p>

<p>"And then there's a matter&mdash;I don't quite dare to ask her,
Rose, about&mdash;about rooms&mdash;"</p>

<p>Rose answered with the coarseness that only a truly good and
wedded woman can achieve. "You mean, do you think she'll want the
favors of the same bed with you every night, or to have a room of
her own. Of her own, of course; same as any woman born since 1890.
If you knew how Don gurgles all night long, and when he turns over,
he sits up straight and then moans in terror and shakes himself
like a wet dog and then he doesn't just lie down again&mdash;he
makes a dive at the pillow&mdash;a belly-flopper dive. Give her the
northeast bedroom, Cassy; the one I had as a girl. It's smaller
than that funeral parlor of yours, but it gets the sun."</p>

<p>"It's a go!" said His Honor, the learned judge.</p>

<p>He felt very clever and efficient.<br>
<br></p>

<p>His Honor, the learned judge, who had heard the details of
maniac sex-murders and been bland enough in discussing them with
psychiatrists, approached Jinny like a freshman:</p>

<p>"You know, just at first, we might&mdash;uh&mdash;we might not
want any children, and I believe there are
precautions&mdash;uh&mdash;is there a woman clerk in your father's
drug store that would&mdash;uh&mdash;I hate to speak of this
but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You poor dear lamb! What do you suppose girls talk about
nowadays?"</p>

<p>"Do they really? I didn't know."</p>

<p>"There, there, Mother's glad you've kept your innocence."<br>
<br></p>

<p>As a politician, Cass did possess the correct morning clothes,
but there was a crisis in the matter of the top hat, that symbol,
that grotesque crown made of rabbit's fur, that more than the coat
of arms or the broad A or even the dollar sign distinguishes a gent
from a fellow. In Grand Republic, they rate with bustles, and while
Cass did own a top hat, he had last worn it at a Plattdeutsch
funeral, and it had long rested in the attic, a nest for mice.</p>

<p>He begged of Jinny, "You don't want me to wear a stovepipe hat,
like Abraham Lincoln?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I do! I've never seen one, except in the movies! Let's be
gaudy for once. I don't expect to get married but just this one
time in all my life."</p>

<p>"Fine!"</p>

<p>He had the Piccadilly Cents' Ware Shop send for the hat. When he
had put on the whole armor of a knight, the high silk helmet,
steely white shirt, linen gorget, dark-gray coat shaped like a
calla lily, and studied himself in the full-length mirror on the
back of his bathroom door, he was delighted.<br>
<br></p>

<p>His best man, Dr. Drover, along with Boone Havock, Bradd Criley,
Judge Flaaten, Frank Brightwing, and his other ushers had talked of
a bachelor dinner, but he had no mind to endure their heavy jokes.
The thought of Jinny was to him as frail and muted as a distant
flute in the autumnal dusk.</p>

<p>He spent his last evening before the wedding alone with Cleo in
the quarter-lighted library.</p>

<p>Was Jinny in love with him at all? Did she love him enough to
endure his longing to give her everything that he was and had? It
is more difficult to receive tolerantly than to give gladly. Of
Jinny's mother and grandmother the question would never have been
asked, but did Jinny, or any girl of her era, really attach herself
to her husband and his fortunes, sick or in health, richer or
poorer, avid for bright noise or content with the quiet mind?</p>

<p>He was apprehensive.</p>

<p>Cleo, who had been asleep upon his knee beside the dead fire,
came suddenly awake, twitching and terrified, and leaped from him.
He could hear her protests as she roamed the dark house, up and
down, searching for something he did not understand. He sat uneasy,
and when the telephone assaulted his ears, he gasped.</p>

<p>It was Jinny. "How are you darling? Are you scared, like
me?"</p>

<p>"Bless you for calling. Scared stiff."</p>

<p>"Well, and very right, too, Cass. Both of us ought to be; both
of us these disgusting Sensitive Souls, looking for a chance to be
hurt and likely to get sore when we <i>don't</i> get hurt, because
that shows nobody cares enough about us to hurt us. But what are
you sitting in the dark for?"</p>

<p>"How did you know I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Because I am, too! Good night. Oh, Cass, we're going to have a
lot of fun being married. I'll really learn chess, even. I've
ordered a chess costume: plaid, with rabbit-lined boots. Good
night, my dear!"</p>

<p>He was convinced that this spirit of fire and mist might some
day love him like a breathing woman. But through the house Cleo was
still searching, still whimpering reproachfully.<br>
<br></p>

<p>Jinny was not so avid of grandeur as to want the reception that
Rose Pennloss longed to give for them. She agreed with Cass that it
would be wise to take the train directly after the ceremony. But
that ceremony itself was ducal.</p>

<p>Not since the wedding of Della Lent, and her a Wargate, had
there been a richer gathering of all that was noble, virtuous, and
of five-figure income than at the union of Miss Marshland and Judge
Timberlane; and the Rev. Dr. Gadd wore a new Geneva gown and had a
Lutheran pastor and an Episcopal priest&mdash;pretty young, but of
the very highest church&mdash;for collaborators in the conjuring
whereby the little wild hawk was turned into a Grand Republic
matron.</p>

<p>There were even Prutts present. It was more fun to attend and
look doubtful than to stay away.</p>

<p>Through the forest of mink and broadtail, Cass saw Jinny coming
down the aisle with her father. He noted, as casually as though he
were studying a jury, that Mr. Marshland seemed timid and shrunken
and shabby, against all the sleek furriness, and that Jinny, in
cloudy white, was of the precise loveliness and inviolability of a
goddess.</p>

<p>&mdash;God keep her shining and confident as she is now.</p>

<p>Then Jinny was his wife, and she was looking at him trustingly,
and there was trust and adoration in his first marital whisper to
her, "Let's try to sneak out the back door; we got just an hour and
a quarter before the train goes" and in her enchanted answer,
"Okay, darling&mdash;my husband!"</p>

<h2>Chapter 23</h2>

<p>They met again at the station, in rather-too-new traveling
costumes. During the maverick reception on the platform, with
champagne served in paper cups, it was not Roy, the best man, but
Bradd Criley who was the clown. He yelled, he slapped backs, he
kissed Jinny, Lyra Coggs, Chris Grau, and Jinny's astonished
mother. The train was going then, and Cass was muttering to Jinny,
"It's good to get away from our loving friends."</p>

<p>In their Pullman seats, she boldly held his hand, not caring who
looked, and said with a strange little fierceness, "We've started,
and I'm incredibly excited and cheerful, and Heaven knows where it
will end&mdash;maybe China and temple bells."</p>

<p>But she had never been farther East or South than Central
Wisconsin, and when they had left St. Paul for Chicago, the bold
and Chinaward girl became less confident and Cass was promoted from
home-town neighbor to expert traveler, who knew all about altitudes
and populations and how to treat dining-car waiters, and she looked
at him with 1880 bridal reverence, and asked him about the scenery
as though he were a geologist.</p>

<p>There was food for awe: The palisades along the Mississippi,
dark giant rock and swooping slopes of snow. The ravines of
Wisconsin, leading to wintry valleys. The North Shore suburbs of
Chicago, where at stations influenced by the Alhambra the wives of
significant insurance-brokers looked haughtily out from station
wagons. Lake Michigan, a relentless ocean. The portentous jungle of
Chicago factories and warehouses and slums, the smutted steel
insanity of the Loop, and the leather and crystal Pump Room, where
she listened admiringly while Cass, who knew nothing whatever about
the subject, held a symposium on sauternes with the
wine-waiter.</p>

<p>The Liveoak Special, leaving for Florida at one A.M., was a
supple serpent of a train, all in crimson-barred silver, with no
vestibules breaking its smoothness. The fourth-fastest train on the
continent, it had a library car, a bar-room car, a car for dancing,
four bathrooms, two stenographers, and a Social Hostess who had
once been married to a Russian prince who had once been married to
a Hollywood female star who had once been married to practically
anybody.</p>

<p>Jinny looked at these conveniences as one of her peasant
ancestors might have looked at Kenilworth Castle. It was her Cass
who had given her this train. There was a husband for you!</p>

<p>She did not know that he was in the agony of
accommodations-trouble.</p>

<p>Like many young people of the day, Jinny was familiar with
automobiles but less familiar with trains than her own grandmother
had been. She had motored with her parents twelve hundred miles out
to Yellowstone Park, confidently driving four hundred miles a day,
but she had never spent a night on a sleeping-car and she knew no
more about the subtle categories of berths, sections, roomettes,
bedrooms, compartments, and drawing-rooms than she did about the
etiquette of wedding-nights, so delicately connected with them.</p>

<p>In the Florida rush which was now taking the place of trips to
war-barred Europe, the Liveoak Special's private rooms had all been
engaged a fortnight before Cass applied. He unscrupulously tried to
use the influence of the court, the mayor, the local political
bosses, and the department-store owner, but the best he had been
able to do was two lower berths across from each other.</p>

<p>They rustled through the Pullman, already stuffy with sleep and
green curtains, and Jinny had no surprise when he showed her the
two separate cloth-smothered caves. She only said, inevitably, "Do
I have to sit on my clothes while I'm taking them off? Mercy! Good
night, dearest; wonderful day, wonderful journey. I <i>like</i>
being Mrs. Timberlane!"</p>

<p>And vanished between the curtains.</p>

<p>He sat on his berth, smolderingly took his shoes off, and
thoughtfully rubbed his toes. He was in his pajamas (very refined
mellilunar ones, a dark-blue silk with a fine silver stripe) and
under the close-tucked bedclothes before he decided that he had to
do better than this. He would kiss her good night, anyway. They
were married, weren't they? He had some rights, didn't he?</p>

<p>The solid Sioux nose of Judge Timberlane jutted cautiously out
into the aisle, and turned right and left and hung there, rigid, as
the eyes immediately above it perceived that George the Porter was
standing inflexibly in the curving niche of Drawing Room A, on
watch.</p>

<p>The nose was jerked inside and its proprietor felt guilty, but
also credulous that, through the sound of the moving train, he had
heard a delicious flutter of disrobing in the berth across the
aisle&mdash;so near, so perilous.</p>

<p>Three times the nose came solemnly pushing out. Once it shot
back at the approach of the conductor, once at the return of the
persistent and unromantic George, but the third time it shot
across, and Cass was shaking her curtain, moaning, "Unbutton
this&mdash; open it up&mdash;quick!"</p>

<p>He was safe inside then, but flustered.</p>

<p>She was in pajamas, pale-yellow silk, well curving, and she was
sitting up, staring at him. He expected a protest at his wild
invasion, but what she said was, "Aren't those the nicest little
lights! You can lie awake and read by 'em!"</p>

<p>"Jinny! Kiss me&mdash;and in the greatest hurry!"</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"If the conductor finds me here&mdash;He doesn't know we're
married. I should hate a public argument! Kiss me!"</p>

<p>She did, leaning forward. She was in his arms, only the two thin
layers of silk between them; and shakily, not at all masterfully,
he undid the top button of her tunic and softly kissed her breast.
Then she drew back, as far as the thick pillows would let her, and
whispered, "It frightens me&mdash;you dash in here so
quickly&mdash;I do love you, but now I'm kind of frightened and so
alone&mdash;this huge train rushing us along in the darkness; you
couldn't escape from it, if you wanted to&mdash;Be gentle with me,
Cass; I'm such a spoiled baby."</p>

<p>"Yes, I'll always be gentle, I hope. I love you very much. And
now good night, dear wife...And don't you sit up and read,
either!"</p>

<p>He had shot back into his own berth through green denim space,
unconscious of transition or of spying conductors, and he lay awake
alternately exultant with memory of how satin-like her breast had
been and worrying lest she prove too anemic for ardent love. He had
heard that these pencil-wise, half-intellectual girls were often
so.</p>

<p>His berth-light was on, and in it he gapingly saw a smooth hand
slip between the curtains and begin to unbutton them, and then,
grotesquely, there was Jinny cheerfully returning his visit. But
with a woman's sense and realism and magnificent vulgarity, she was
not playing at furtive lover, as he had. She drew wide the curtains
and left them open, and in her pajamas, with the vaguest of
negligees merely setting them off, she sat cross-legged on his bed.
And she was smoking a cigarette.</p>

<p>"Golly!" said the learned Judge.</p>

<p>Her bent knees were extraordinarily round and suave, he noted,
and where was that porter, and would he have to have a row?</p>

<p>"It did seem so unfriendly not to return your call," she said,
and her expression was like that of Cleo in one of her better
moods. "And I wanted to tell you something&mdash;I've always wanted
to, but I was too embarrassed&mdash;but you must have wondered, I
don't see how you could have helped it&mdash;of course you were too
much of a gentleman to ever ask&mdash;"</p>

<p>The porter's voice, not so much shocked as official, came from
just beyond Jinny's shoulder.</p>

<p>"Sorry, Miss, but we don't allow any smoking in the berths."</p>

<p>Cass could see the edge of Jinny's affable smile as she turned.
"Oh, I am sorry. Porter, will you please take this cigarette and
finish it up for me? It's an awfully good one&mdash;a wedding
present&mdash; today!"</p>

<p>The dazed Cass saw the dazed porter carry the cigarette away, at
arm's length, while Jinny turned back with:</p>

<p>"Of course you would never even hint at it, but I do imagine
you'd like to know, so now I can tell you&mdash;and I'm darned if I
know whether this is a boast or a confession&mdash;but if it
interests you, I'm still a virgin."</p>

<p>Suddenly he grew up a little, and he was placid in saying, "Yes,
it does interest me, and I'm glad, though I don't think I'd 've
been ugly if it had been the opposite. And I love you madly and you
go back to bed or I'll spank hell out of you."</p>

<p>"Right here in public? In my pajamas? I dare you to!" she said,
and kissed him and was gone.</p>

<p>Infinite pity encompassed him that she should have to grow older
and more frail, helpless before covetous men and corroding illness,
before poverty and storms that would come halfway round the world
to threaten her proud head.<br>
<br></p>

<p>In the morning they had left the snow and were running through
level farmlands with a sparkle of frost on gray grass and gray
snake-fences. He did not know whether they were in Illinois or
Indiana or Kentucky, so for her information he picked the last, as
most distant from the center of the world&mdash;Grand Republic. She
stared out and said joyfully, "Look what you've started! This is my
first foreign country. How near are we to China now?"</p>

<p>He had explained that, in preference to the gaudiness of Palm
Beach and Miami, he had chosen a plain West Coast Florida resort,
for privacy, for adventurous fishing, for bathing and shell-hunting
on great lonely beaches. He had never seen the place, but Harley
Bozard said the food was excellent and the fishing superb. She'd
certainly enjoy catching a tarpon.</p>

<p>Oh, yes. She'd always wanted to catch a&mdash;a what? Oh, much
better than dancing with a lot of handsome tennis players. Yes, she
had brought old clothes with her, as he had directed; she'd wear
them&mdash; when she wore anything at all.</p>

<p>He did not add, not even to himself&mdash;not really&mdash;that
the place would also be much cheaper.</p>

<p>Thus she was not completely disappointed when, on the morning of
December fifth, they came to Baggs City, Charlotte County, Florida,
and to the trim, clean, white, and completely dolorous
Bryn-Thistle-on-the-Bay Inn. The small lobby was full of old ladies
who listened and of geraniums which stared, and their bedroom, just
large enough for a double bed and a bureau and two chairs, was
adorned with a hand-lettered version of the poem about the man who
wanted to live by the side of the road, a pink chamber-pot with
forget-me-nots, and a three-color job of a cupid piloting a
bomber.</p>

<p>"In here, I wouldn't even let you kiss me," protested Jinny.</p>

<p>"Well, there's a lot of outdoors down here."</p>

<p>They walked through the Inn grounds, which were as suburban as
Glendale, but it was magical, two days from the wintry
street-hurrying of Grand Republic, to stroll in this rich and
scented air. Jinny eyed the crepe myrtle, the roses, the obese
wonder of a grape fruit growing, and looked at the Cass who had
worked this magic for her.</p>

<p>"My Merlin!" she said.<br>
<br></p>

<p>All afternoon, in a slow, good-natured launch, they fished in a
deep salt-water inlet bordered by the shade and jungle brightness
of a swamp; they stared at the palms, which meant India and the
Congo to these inlanders from the wheat prairies and the pine
woods; they relaxed and, cheerful as honeymooners rarely are, they
came back to the Inn for supper. But the horrible daintiness of the
place enfeebled them at once. It was like being choked with pink
bedjackets.</p>

<p>All the widows watched them as they ate a meal consisting of
fish and finger-bowls; they had too many invitations to play bridge
and too little competition when they did play; three several
females flickered about "the little bride"; and when they went up
to bed, making it as late as was physically possible after an
afternoon spent on the water, the air was so thick with lascivious
female glances that they could have climbed it instead of the
stairs.</p>

<p>They shut the door against a world of intrusive friendliness.
They faced each other, and he understood her shyness and tried to
speak as he thought her Gang at Miss Hatter's would speak:</p>

<p>"Well, baby, this is it. I guess we're up against it. But let me
explain that I'm not just violently in love with you. I'm also
extremely fond of you."</p>

<p>She was shivering, but she tried to be merry.</p>

<p>"They all make so much of this accidental virtue of virginity
that you get scared about it, and the wedding-night&mdash;I suppose
this is our real wedding-night&mdash;is a combination of getting
drunk and winning a million-dollar lottery and waiting to be
hanged. Animals are a lot wiser." Then, more sharply, "I hate being
an amateur, in <i>anything!</i>"</p>

<p>In a practical way, she had begun to undo her belt, and when he
had tremblingly drawn off his jacket, she stood, looking admirably
casual, in brassiere and absurd small pants. He could not help
kissing her shoulder, which tasted faintly of sun and sea. When she
had put on a pathetically gay little rose-colored nightgown that
must have come from Pioneer Falls and had mutely slid into bed
beside him, he held her quietly, hoping that she would feel
secure.</p>

<p>He was conscious of the creeping and thunderous silences of the
Inn: hesitant slippered footsteps past the door, whispering in the
adjoining rooms, a feeling that an inquisitive world was looking at
them through the wallboard partitions. He was tense with listening,
and Jinny, in his arms, was as impersonal to him as a pillow, and
apprehensively he realized that he could no more make ardent love
to her now than to that pillow.</p>

<p>Was he going to be a failure as lover with this one girl whom he
had loved utterly?</p>

<p>She muttered, with almost prayerful earnestness, "Was the
bathroom the third door on the right or the second? I'd hate to go
rocketing in on some old maid!"</p>

<p>He laughed then, and lost his apprehensiveness. But as he kissed
her it was she who had become fearful and unyielding, and in pity
for her his ardor sank to a gentle stroking of her cheek.</p>

<p>When she seemed to have relaxed a little, to be expectant, his
intensity had so worn him that he could only hold her softly, while
fear crept through him again, and he stammered, "I've heard of such
things but I never expected&mdash;I find I'm so fond of you, and
maybe scared of you, that just now I can't even make love to
you."</p>

<p>She answered as sweetly and briskly as though they were
discussing a picnic-basket.</p>

<p>"Yes, I've heard of it. Temporary&mdash;not matter a bit. Oh,
you'd be surprised at all the things Lyra and Wilma and I used to
talk about. Don't worry. I love just lying with my cheek on your
shoulder&mdash;now that I've found a comparatively regular valley
among the jagged peaks of your shoulder-blades. Dear darling!"</p>

<p>They were almost instantly asleep and Cass came to life at dawn
to sit up and see, on her own side of the bed, curled like a cat
and rosily sleeping, his adored and inviolate bride.</p>

<h2>Chapter 24</h2>

<p>They fished again in the salt inlet, next day; they delightedly
though erroneously believed that they saw a barracuda, a
threatening moccasin; they felt valiant as only tourists can. They
hired a Drive-Yourself car, put in bathing-suits and a bottle of
cognac for emergencies, and cruised slowly down sandy roads among
the yuccas.</p>

<p>In late afternoon they came to an inlet with a great wash of wet
sand and a cluster of whitewashed shacks: over-night cabins and a
restaurant for impecunious tourists&mdash;the eternal gipsy
encampment, the wooden-tented caravan.</p>

<p>"Look! We can get away from the painted bridge-pads here! Here's
the place for thwarted hoboes!" said Cass. And Jinny noted that on
their journey to China, they had come as far as Tahiti.</p>

<p>The restaurant walls were of upright bamboo, with palm thatch;
the interior was cool and dim, with cement floor and loose-looking
tables and black-and-white reed chairs. The pine bar was for
drinking, not for the display of glassware. The bartender was a
Minorcan, with a trim thread of mustache, the waitress was Mexican,
and in the shadowed background, letting his planless harmonies drip
from a guitar, was an old man in overalls, barefoot and masked with
whiskers.</p>

<p>The troubadour waved his straw hat and the bartender greeted
them, "H' are you, folks." They had two Daiquiris, cool and silken,
and dined on fresh red snapper and a Cuban cocoa-nut ice cream.</p>

<p>Before dinner they had inspected the bare pine cottages, each
with only a double bed, a chair, and a water-tap, yet far larger
than the Inn cubicles, and voluptuously furnished altogether, for
outside each door was the curving sand and the rolling Gulf of
Mexico.</p>

<p>"I wish we were staying here, instead of at that
knitting-works," sighed Jinny.</p>

<p>The bar-restaurant half filled, after dinner, with Italian
fishermen, Mexican truck-farmers, and such tourists as wandered by
flivver and trailer, not to improve their minds or tans or social
standing, but just to wander. Cass bought drinks for half a dozen
new lifelong friends. Everybody beamed at him and Jinny, not
titteringly, as at the Inn, but with an earthy love of lovers, and
the troubadour played "La Paloma" at them.</p>

<p>"Let's stay here tonight, in one of the cabins," Cass blurted,
astonished at himself.</p>

<p>"With no baggage?"</p>

<p>"We have ourselves."</p>

<p>"Okay."</p>

<p>When Cass paid for a cabin in advance, the bartender took it for
granted that they were not married, and was delighted by the whole
general idea. So were the eloping Cass and Jinny as, with no bags
to unpack, they took possession of their first real home
together.</p>

<p>There were no occupied shacks near them, no whispering lady
guests, but only the sliding sea. They lay with the door half open
to the night, and suddenly he was ruthless with love and she as
fierce as he, nipping his ear with angry little teeth, and they
fell asleep in the surprise of love.</p>

<p>At dawn, Cass woke her and they ran down the beach and bathed,
unclad and laughing, and came back to new abandonment.</p>

<p>Jinny marveled, "We both seem to be great successes. It was a
terrible shock at first, but now I do cleave to you and we are one
flesh."</p>

<p>"Forever?"</p>

<p>"Forever and ever, beloved!"</p>

<p>Sleeping and waking, waking and sleeping, their open door
embracing the wash of the fertile tide, amazed by the curiousness
of arms and legs and breasts, redeemed from civilization they lay
about the tousled bed till noon, and dressed and ate fried
corn-mush for breakfast, to the commendatory smiling of the
waitress. They wanted to be dignified, as suited their unique
position in the history of lovers, but they also wanted to guffaw
when Jinny said, "Think of what the old ladies at the Bryn-Thistle
must be saying&mdash; the painted old hussies!"</p>

<p>They were one flesh, truly, and ecstatic with life.</p>

<p>"'Husband,'" she mused. "I used to think that word sounded
funny, but now it seems such a sturdy old word. It takes me back,
clear through Walter Scott to King Arthur, back to the Anglo-Saxons
and the old woods of Wessex, and I feel as if you and I were in a
bark hut, worshiping the old gods. My Druid! My husband!"</p>

<p>"My wife! Yes, there are words that even the radio can't
spoil."</p>

<p>"Golly! Were the Druids Anglo-Saxon or Celtic or what?"</p>

<p>"I honestly don't know," he said, in a blissfully shared
community of ignorance.<br>
<br></p>

<p>There were no other guests at the tourist camp on this shining
Sunday, and during the night Cass and Jinny had had no considerable
sleep. Happily frowzy in the shade before their frowzy shack, lying
on the long beach-grass with the sea-wind sweet about them, they
slept through the afternoon.</p>

<p>They might not have gone back to the Bryn-Thistle at all that
night&mdash;the night of December 7, 1941&mdash;but they were not
yet so saved from Pruttery that they could stay on without clean
clothes.</p>

<p>They would come down here again, in a couple of days.
Certainly.</p>

<p>With her arm injudiciously linked in his as he drove, they
returned to the Bryn-Thistle at dusk, and from the porch a woman
joyful at finding victims who had not heard the news screamed at
them, in delighted horror, "Been away? Then you don't know. We're
in the war! Japan attacked our ships at Pearl Harbor today!"</p>

<p>They said nothing till they were in their room. Then, staring at
him as though she had found him treacherous, Jinny said sharply,
"Oh, curse the luck! Why couldn't I have known a few weeks ago?
This time, they'll take women in the army. I could have seen
Hawaii&mdash;France&mdash;Russia! And all the boys will be
going&mdash;Eino and Tracy and Abbott Hubbs and everybody! And I'll
be left home with the old women!"</p>

<p>"And with me, my dear."</p>

<p>"Yes," sardonically, "with you!"</p>

<p>Her tantrum&mdash;that was what they had come to call any of her
not-too-frequent wild moods&mdash;was agallop. She moaned, "I hear
they'll make women captains and majors and everything now&mdash;in
uniform and be saluted&mdash;and station 'em with the
flyers&mdash;young and brave and good-looking!"</p>

<p>&mdash;I don't blame her for being disappointed&mdash;greatest
chance for adventure women 've ever seen. But&mdash;It certainly
does hurt to have her talk as though I were senile. Be careful
now&mdash;be gentle.</p>

<p>"Jinny, I'm sure you can still get into the war, even if you are
married."</p>

<p>"Oh, no. You'll complain about being left alone in your gloomy
ole Bergheim."</p>

<p>"We can do war-work&mdash;maybe together."</p>

<p>"Aaaah! Rolling bandages with Mrs. Prutt, and you being
obsequious to that old camel!"</p>

<p>"Jinny! Quit it! If you want to go off to war, you shall. But
I'm not going to let you forget last night."</p>

<p>She fled to him and kissed him. "Forgive me for carrying on so.
I just meant&mdash;You <i>are</i> a darling, and I do love you so;
I even love you passionately, now, as I never could any other man
living."</p>

<p>"More than the jittery Mr. Hubbs, even if he's in uniform?"</p>

<p>"Oh, now <i>you're</i> being nasty. Much better than Mr.
Jitters. Even more than my cute Eino. But you must admit that
you're not as awe-inspiring as a whole army marching together."</p>

<p>"I certainly do. Jinny, shall I try to get into the Army, into
uniform&mdash;maybe the Judge Advocate's department?"</p>

<p>"No, I imagine they'll tell you that you can do more good right
where you are. And maybe me too, where I am. Yes&mdash;maybe."</p>

<p>&mdash;Now shut up, Cass. She'll get over her disappointment if
you just keep still.</p>

<p>He did keep still, but he felt useless, he felt that she did not
vastly appreciate his labors as a jurist and a defender of
Democracy. He felt, in fact, sulky, and doubtless his sulkiness was
visible to her. When he said, with what he considered admirable
good nature, "How about our going fishing again tomorrow&mdash;
haven't tackled that tarpon yet," and she echoed, "<i>Fishing!</i>"
he yelped, "All right then, we won't! Of course we do only what
<i>you</i> want to, my dear Jinny!"</p>

<p>"And just what is there to do, in this dump?"</p>

<p>That was all of their quarrel.</p>

<p>They did go fishing next day, on a placid-colored inlet, and
they were so fond of each other that they almost forgot the war,
and everybody forgave everybody everything. But it <i>had</i> been
a quarrel, and if possibly she had started it, he had been the
guiltier in carrying it on. They had had differences before, but
this had been their first quarrel, their first drink, their first
murder, and so, inevitably, it was the beginning of a series of
quarrels interspersed with frantic peace-proposals, while the
little crystal Isis listened bleakly.<br>
<br></p>

<p>Their second quarrel rose from one of her "tantrums,"
comprehensible but unexpected. In the midst of a poor little dance
that the Bryn-Thistle was trying to give, with aged gentlewomen
tottering around the dining-room dancing together, Jinny demanded,
"Have we got to go on staying in this hencoop when people are
having such a gorgeous time at Palm Beach? Aren't we good enough to
go there?"</p>

<p>"My dear child, we'll go over there any time you want to. We'll
go tomorrow. We'll hire a car and a driver."</p>

<p>That was all, and after another dance, she apologized: "I'm
sorry I flared up so. I'm sure the dear old things here mean well,
but they get on my nerves."</p>

<p>"We'll go up and start packing now."</p>

<p>"You're wonderful, and I'm sorry I was noisy and
spiteful&mdash;and come on, let's get going! Palm Beach, here I
come!"</p>

<p>&mdash;Do people who love each other always bicker and scratch
and hurt? Must they?<br>
<br></p>

<p>They both felt guilty when all the guests at the Bryn-Thistle
came out on the porch to cry, "It's been so nice to meet you both.
We just loved knowing you, Judge, and your dear little bride."</p>

<p>It was a hundred miles across the Everglades to Palm Beach, and
they sang all the way, hand in hand, behind their sedate colored
driver. She was radiant then, a joyous peasant with a red kerchief
round her dark hair, and when they came into the American Cannes,
where all the people are beautiful, the houses all carven of gold,
and the ocean water especially imported from the Riviera daily, by
airplane, she was impressed to a blissful awe.</p>

<p>The season was early; they were able to get a suite at the Royal
Crown: two rooms filled with white-fur rugs and glass tables and
chairs so modern that you sat in them as in a bucket; and Jinny
squealed continuously in the high religious passion of absolute
luxury, and he ordered up a bottle of Johannisberger Cabinet, in
the slow drinking of which they enjoyed everything but the
taste.</p>

<p>He telephoned to Berthold Eisenherz, now head of the very
richest family in Grand Republic, who came down to his villa at
Palm Beach every winter. Eisenherz was cordial, which exiled Grand
Republicans are not always to their fellow refugees, and urged them
to come over to the villa for dinner and dancing, that evening.</p>

<p>So for five hours the Timberlanes lived in a Hollywood motion
picture: a marble terrace on the starry ocean, a Cuban orchestra,
champagne from a portable silver-striped bar, roses on a December
night, and young Navy officers who danced with Jinny. The war
seemed only fictional. She exulted, "Cass, this is the night I've
lived for&mdash;this and our night at the gipsy camp. I'm
intolerably happy! I'm sorry if I was ever cross. Because I love
you!"</p>

<p>"More even than that lieutenant s.g.?"</p>

<p>"More even than that lieutenant j.g.!"</p>

<p>"Champagne, madame?" said the footman, who was a deacon in the
Swedish Baptist Church, back home in Minneapolis.</p>

<p>Jinny's husband was so relaxed that for the five enchanted hours
he actually let her enjoy what he had so anxiously wanted to have
her enjoy. And through the net of Jinny's black evening bag Isis
peered out with a benignity that knew not good or evil.<br>
<br></p>

<p>The Honorable Mr. Hudbury, United States Senator Hudbury, should
have been in Washington, lighting the war, but as he was a very
thick, round, stupid man, it may have been as well that he was
taking a week off from statesmanship to repose his limbs, which
looked like four fingers of an enormous pale-white glove, as they
were displayed upon the sands of Palm Beach. As an
ex-representative, Cass recognized the Senator even in the
improbable disguise of a bloated violet bathing-suit, with a belt
patriotically symbolizing the American flag encircling the globe.
Mr. Hudbury's belly being the globe.</p>

<p>Now Cass did not care for Mr. Hudbury, not as a pal. Mr. Hudbury
started every sentence with "In my opinion," and he spent week-ends
with lobbyists. Cass would not have collected Honorable Mr.
Hudbury, or any other accidental celebrity, except to give him to
Jinny, but since he had not given her any presents now since ten
o'clock this morning&mdash;the present then had been a coral
necklace which looked like the devil on her&mdash;he now picked up
the Senator's halo and handed it to her.</p>

<p>Fortunately Hudbury remembered him, and fortunately he did not
remember that he had hated Congressman Timberlane after a party
caucus at which the fellow had suggested that even Republicans
ought to know that there was a new invention called labor
unions.</p>

<p>They were a musical-comedy group upon these tropic sands: the
Senator tubby and half naked, the Judge stalwart and three-quarters
naked, and Jinny, like all the other respectable women at that time
and place, almost entirely naked, charmingly naked, with white
midriff turning coffee-color. With difficulty could you have found
three people more nude or more piously against "this crank theory
of Nudism."</p>

<p>"Senator, I don't know whether you'll recall me&mdash;Cass
Timberlane, formerly in Congress from Minnesota."</p>

<p>"Why, yes, yes, my boy, how could I forget a wheelhorse who has
rendered such sterling services to the Party! Sure. You had that
house on H Street, and the cocktails made with Swedish aquavit.
Perfectly."</p>

<p>"This is my wife."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, and of course I remember you, too, and the
name&mdash;ah, ah now, wait, don't tell me&mdash;<i>Blanche!</i>"
The Senator looked confused, but he was used to it. For years and
years he had been confused over something or other, and he would
continue to be confused until someone in his State discovered that
he was their Senator, and had him defeated.</p>

<p>Jinny looked irritated, then winked at Cass, yet she viewed
Hudbury not without respect. After all, a United States Senator is
a United States Senator, even when he is a hoot-owl. (She still
held that innocent theory. She had never lived in Washington.)</p>

<p>The Senator went on making sounds like an empty barrel. "How
could I forget anything so charming as your lady, Cass? Ravished to
see you again, Blanche."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't be ravished, Senator."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I will! I can't help it. Now, folks, I'm about to
assume the normal habiliments of a gentleman, and what-say you join
me for a cocktail on the terrace of the Choiseul in half an
hour?"</p>

<p>Cass looked to Jinny for permission, and said, "Fine."</p>

<p>The truth is that over the cocktails, and how many of them there
were, Jinny was proud of being intimate with this aged poop, and if
he did reveal himself by saying that "American Business stands
wholeheartedly back of the war effort, ready to pledge every dollar
to encourage Our Boys," yet he also revealed the senatorial magic
by having somehow discovered, while he was dressing, that Blanche's
name was now Virginia. It is probable that while he was under the
shower he had been speaking to the Federal Bureau of Inquiry by
vest-pocket radio.</p>

<p>Calling her "Jinny," pouring his black-molasses charm all over
her, he first told her that as a boy he had sold newspapers. That
was for him an obligatory introduction to anything he had to say,
whether in the Senate, a grocery store, or a parlor house. Then he
took them right into the heart of world affairs by confiding that
on the very day after Pearl Harbor, he had been summoned to the
White House for a small conference of the leaders of both parties.
(That the President had noticed that Senator Hudbury was there or,
if so, that he had said anything to him beyond "Got a cigarette?"
Cass and Jinny never could find out.)</p>

<p>After cocktails the Senator took them on to the roulette club
where, but under strictly honest, home-made American conditions,
none of your foreign shenanigans, Jinny lost forty dollars.</p>

<p>Here, they were in a spotlight of international chic. The
Senator's secretary, a pale young man with constant reservations,
who was the Senator's eyes and his ideology, had come with them,
and he pointed out, at the gaming tables, the third-greatest radio
crooner in America, the fourth-greatest New York banker, the
fifth-most-beautiful woman from Alabama, a colonel who was going to
be a major general, a major general who was going to be a retired
major general, and a gentleman, with a beard, who had been a German
manufacturer but was now an exiled French patriot.</p>

<p>Through all of this global low-down, Cass was as grateful as
little Jinny, and said as they parted&mdash;he did not sound like
Judge Timberlane of the Twenty-Second Judicial District&mdash;"It
was extremely kind of you, Senator, to give us such a good time. I
appreciate it."</p>

<p>At dinner, the two of them at their hotel, Jinny pounced:</p>

<p>"Have a good time, Cass?"</p>

<p>"Splendid. How did you like the Senator?"</p>

<p>"He's a fool."</p>

<p>"Yes, he does rather bear that reputation. But he's always been
clever at picking useful brothers-in-law."</p>

<p>"Why were you so excited by having the old pot condescend to
you?"</p>

<p>"M?"</p>

<p>"He doesn't even know anything about politics, only about
politicians. He doesn't know half as much as Tracy Oleson or Mr.
Hubbs." Then, clearly as an afterthought, "Or as you. Why did you
ever drag in the old idiot?"</p>

<p>"Because I thought he would amuse you."</p>

<p>"Dullness doesn't amuse me."</p>

<p>"I picked him out for you the way I did your coral necklace. I
wouldn't want to rub my face against the coral, either. Don't be so
youthfully censorious. If you don't care to have Hudbury for your
collection, if you don't want me to shoot him and stuff him for
you, we'll throw him out...Jinny!...Sweet!"</p>

<p>"I know, darling! I <i>am</i> censorious. <i>and</i> young. And
I do try to show off my superiority. I'm sorry. Some day, I'll grow
up."</p>

<p>And of that quarrel there was nothing more. But Cass was
thinking nervously that for years yet she would be impulsive, hasty
to judge him, aggressively independent, like the other children of
her Positively Final New Modern Revolutionary Age which by 1970
would have come to seem such a naive Old-fashioned Age.</p>

<p>&mdash;Like all these girls, she feels&mdash;and how can you
blame her&mdash;that she must have her own life. Besides that, I'm
no longer the family priest to her or a guide or a refuge; I'm just
A Husband. And I don't even care much, so long as she'll let me go
on being <i>that!</i><br>
<br></p>

<p>There was nothing in the Specimen Hudbury that Jinny had not
been able to identify from her Pioneer Falls collecting. In fact he
looked like the local pre-motor livery-stable keeper who was still
sitting in front of his empty barn, still covered with hay-dust,
waiting for this automobile craze to pass.</p>

<p>But she was impressed and a little confused when they went to
lunch at Berthold Eisenherz's villa, and so was Cass. At the villa
dance they had met Berthold only as a sort of private head-waiter.
Now, they collided with him as a personality.</p>

<p>The only thing about him to hint that he was not a gentleman was
that he too consistently looked too much like a gentleman. He had
devoted the voluminous money that his grandfather had made, as a
Minnesota pioneer, by skinning beaver and redskins, to Harvard and
Heidelberg and the Sorbonne and a black-eyed, red-tempered Latvian
girl who spoke all languages, in and out of bed, and so had
qualified himself for the American diplomatic corps, in which,
before he got tired, he had risen to first secretary in a minor
legation.</p>

<p>He looked like a German who was trying to look like an
Englishman. He had been married, now and then, to the daughters of
German-American millionaires, who played pianos and barons. At
fifty, he was bald and not officially married; he was bald and
erect and soft-spoken. In Palm Beach he wore the monocle that even
he did not dare to display back home in Grand Republic, where
Swedish and Finnish urchins and Roy Drover and Boone Havock would
have made exactly the same rather Freudian comments upon it.</p>

<p>He had the Timberlanes for one of his better Grade-B luncheons,
with one actress, one lady pianist, one viscountess, a Swiss
violinist, and an economist from New Zealand. At the flower-strewn,
yellow-damask covered table, on the terrace looking to the Southern
sea, the Timberlanes listened while the viscountess tried to talk
faster than the pianist.</p>

<p>Berthold himself talked only to Jinny, asking her questions in a
manner that made her feel solid and original. Afterward, Jinny
confided to Cass, "That was fun. The visvy-whateveritis-countess
was silly, but I think your friend Berthold is wonderful. I always
heard so much about him in Grand Republic, but I never saw him
before. Will we see him when he goes back in the spring?"</p>

<p>"I guess so. If we want to."</p>

<p>"Isn't he hard to know?"</p>

<p>"'Hard to know'? Why should he be? Just because he's rich? Back
home, we're not as naive as Palm Beach. We know where his money
came from!"</p>

<p>"No, I don't mean 'because he's rich'! Because he's wise and
charming, and he treats a colt like me as though I were a&mdash;you
know&mdash;a countess, too. And the way he can speak French! And
knows all about Bessarabia! And kiss the hand! My hand's still
tingling from it. Oh, boy!"</p>

<p>"If you're going out for international society, along with
Excellency Bertie, you can't mix your dialects, and say 'Oh,
boy'!"</p>

<p>"Okay. But don't you like Bertie?"</p>

<p>"Would you be surprised if I said he's even phonier than Senator
Hudbury?"</p>

<p>"I certainly would. And I would be fairly sure&mdash;fairly sure
that you were going jealous on me again."</p>

<p>He gaped. It was true; he was jealous; jealous of Eisenherz, not
because he owned a palace but because with it he had been able to
impress Jinny; not that he knew the Deauville patter but that he
could make Jinny admire it.</p>

<p>He was quick about getting the proper forgiveness, so
<i>that</i> could not be called a quarrel.<br>
<br></p>

<p>There came a hot and humid evening, and Aucassin and Nicolette
acted like Auggie and Nig. For two days they had been idle, soaked
in sun, confidently making love, and that sensible uselessness had
been too much for two people so perpetually active.</p>

<p>They drove over to West Palm Beach to see a super and maddening
movie, and they were unhappy and nervous. He tried to hold her
hand, and she drew hers away. She said it was too damp.</p>

<p>He watched her anxiously, and so she watched him protestingly,
and when they had worked up a fine, thick, hateful tension, he
wanted to cough.</p>

<p>He felt that she was just waiting for him to do something
objectionable like that, cough and whoop and spatter in a public
place&mdash;and so he couldn't do it, and so he wanted all the more
to cough, until the entire subsolar world was one horror of
suppressed coughing, and he let go in one gargantuan throaty
bellow, and, beside him, she gave off electric sparks of rage.
Then, in ostentatious indifference, he crossed his legs, and his
garter came loose, and he had to make a public presentation of
stooping down to fasten it.</p>

<p>He insisted on a sundae after the movie and naturally, being
normally a tidy man, he now dropped chocolate sauce on his white
shirt.</p>

<p>"Disgusting!" she muttered.</p>

<p>She sadistically scrubbed it into a worse mess with her
handkerchief, and they drove back to the hotel in a great hot
silence. So when he was brushing his teeth, he dropped a white spot
of toothpaste on his slipper, and she saw it, oh, she saw it, and
she said:</p>

<p>"Disgusting!"</p>

<p>She thought it over, with all of a good woman's earnestness, and
spoke as to a seven-year-old brat whom even his grandmothers had
agreed to murder:</p>

<p>"Cass, can't you ever pay the least bit of attention to your
personal habits?"</p>

<p>"Whaaaat?"</p>

<p>"I know you've lived alone so much, but still you're supposed to
be an intelligent man, and why you don't even notice it when you
act like a pig&mdash;your sloppy table-manners and yanking your
garter around right out in front of people&mdash;why do you
deliberately go and pick out garters that are guaranteed to come
loose? And dribbling spots on your vest and your dressing-gown, and
as for your <i>lapels</i>&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I deny all of that."</p>

<p>"Dribbling. Constantly."</p>

<p>"I do not dribble! You found one spot on my lapel, a month
ago...before we'd gone and got married. But if it were true, and I
slopped around like a half-wit, I'd expect you to shut up about it.
I'm neither a New England housewife nor a pansy. I want your love,
but not because of my exterior decoration. If you're going to go on
watching me, expecting me to act like an ordinary vulgar
Middlewestern male&mdash;well, that's what I am. I haven't one
single extraordinary virtue except my devotion to you. If you want
to take advantage of that, I'm helpless. But beloved, my beloved,
don't <i>you</i> lose something when you make me into a swine?"</p>

<p>She ran to him, and she was crying, lovely in repentance.</p>

<p>"I didn't realize I was picking on you. I was just letting my
big mouth run on, as Eino used to say. It didn't really mean
anything more than all the silly kidding that Lyra and Tracy and I
used to do. I forgot you're so touchy."</p>

<p>"Am I very touchy?"</p>

<p>"Like a racehorse. But that's why I love you. Oh, my dearest,
I'll never let you go into politics or be a judge or anything like
that. Your hide is about as thick as tissue paper. Kiss me." Her
kiss was that of a naughty child distraught to find that she has
hurt her friend. "I truly think you're the greatest man living.
That's why I was cross with you about Senator Hudbury: that you
didn't realize how much bigger you are than him&mdash;than
he?&mdash; whichever it is. You know, I'm not really ungrateful. I
know I'm lucky to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sweet, don't go on. You're making me feel like a lug for even
spitting back at you...I do love you so!"</p>

<p>"Identical, pal." But her effort to be funny was pathetic, and
she looked so forlorn.</p>

<p>It was after half an hour of tenderness that Cass said, "I'm
sure now we'll never have another quarrel."</p>

<p>"Never!"</p>

<p>"And so I'm going to risk my life and criticize you for
over-dressing."</p>

<p>"M?"</p>

<p>"At lunch at Bertie's, didn't you notice the rigid millionaire
simplicity of that blasted countess? But you had on a boutonniere
<i>and</i> a necklace <i>and</i> two bracelets <i>and</i> a
comic-dog breast-pin <i>and</i> a rhinestone buckle on your hat.
Too much."</p>

<p>"Too Pioneer Falls, eh?"</p>

<p>"Still, why shouldn't you be?"</p>

<p>"Because I am the wife of a judge that ought to be on the
Supreme Court bench right now, and I mean it!"</p>

<p>She must have slipped down to the lobby while he was bathing,
while he was feeling proud of himself for having asserted his power
and ashamed of himself for having so priggishly bullied so
defenseless a little criminal. For there she was, shyly holding out
a small Modern Library edition of South Wind, and begging, "It's a
repentance present."</p>

<p>He almost wept then, while Isis, on the bureau, stretched
herself with ancient despair.</p>

<p>There could never be any more quarrels or jealousy. Never.</p>

<p>On the bathing-beach, when numerous men were attentive to the
pleasant sight of her straight smooth legs, and got acquainted with
her apropos of a dog, a daughter, a cigarette-light, or the quick
sketches of the bathers that Jinny sometimes made in charcoal, then
Cass was proud that he felt no jealousy.</p>

<p>&mdash;Might as well get used to it. When we get back, probably
every friend I have&mdash;Roy, Bradd, Jay, Harley, Frank,
Greg&mdash;the whole bunch of 'em will try to make her. Not a
chance, gentlemen. There's no malice, no treachery, no intrigue in
my Jinny. Going to be none of this "modern, civilized, urbane"
sleeping around and getting complicated in <i>our</i> house.<br>
<br></p>

<p>Their first Christmas dinner together was at Eisenherz's villa.
It was a Grand Republic dinner and full of the double joy of loving
the home town and of being able to get away from it in winter. Webb
and Louise Wargate were there, just come in, and Madge Dedrick.
There was apprehensive talk about the war, and the Wargates
expected to rush home early, but there were also hot rum punch and
tangoing and holly and kisses as harmless as 1890&mdash;though not
more so&mdash;and Bertie and Madge said that Jinny was going to be
their dearest friend for life, starting about March 20th, on their
annual bird-flight back to Grand Republic.</p>

<p>But the real Christmas was later that night, when Cass and Jinny
stood on the balcony of their suite, looking at the tranquil glow
of Lake Worth, and she sighed, "I'll never forget today.
Especially, I won't forget our standing here, us two. And I'm glad
we're going back home&mdash;us two! I don't really fall too much
for this Palm Beach glamor. I know it's just gambling with
counterfeit money."</p>

<p>"I'm glad. I was afraid maybe I'm too rustic for all the
nobility."</p>

<p>"No, you're too independent. Cass, I'm very happy. I'll always
be very happy with you."</p>

<p>They came into the station at Grand Republic in a snowstorm.<br>
<br></p>

<p><b>An Assemblage of Husbands and Wives</b>
</p>

<p><i>George Hame &amp; Friends</i>
</p>

<p>The return of Judge Timberlane to his court room was marked by
an impassive "Glad to see you back, Judge" from Humbert Bellile,
the bailiff, a hand-shake from the clerk of court, and "Now we can
get going&mdash;nice trip, Chief?" from George Hame, the court
reporter.</p>

<p>They were quiet and competent men, though bored, and it appeared
evident from seeing them run the court machinery that they had
nothing so disturbing in their lives as wives to hate or trust,
daughters to be worried about, ambitions to be defended; nothing
more complex than the conduct of dull agricultural arson cases.</p>

<p>Hame and Bellile went, after court, to the Cockrobin Bar, and
had comforting conversation with Ed Oleson, the barber, and Leo
Jensing, the electrician.</p>

<p>"See your boss is back from his honeymoon, George," said
Oleson.</p>

<p>"Looks fit's a fiddle. Incidentally, the best judge in the
State. Born professional."</p>

<p>"What kind of a girl he marry?"</p>

<p>"Cute little trick, bright 's a dollar. Hope she appreciates
him."</p>

<p>Jensing yawned, "Those rich guys that belong to the Federal Club
certainly do marry the swellest dames. Well, they can have 'em.
I'll bet they're all a bunch of headaches. My old woman and
I&mdash;I always tell her she looks like a constipated chicken, and
she says I look like a stubble field&mdash;she's dumb and she was
brought up a Seventh Day Adventist, but we get along like nobody's
business. I cuff the kids and send 'em off to bed and then I get a
can of beer and we strip down to our undershirts and sit around and
tell lies and yap about what rats our neighbors are and generally
enjoy life. The Judge can keep his cutie, and that goes for all the
fat boys in the Federal Club. Say, ever been in that club, George?
What kind of a dump is it?"</p>

<p>Mr. Hame explained, "I often take papers to the Judge there.
It's a pretty swell joint, at that! All wood paneling and the bar's
like a chapel, stone arches and floor. But you know what you can do
with the whole club! Lot of landlords telling each other Roosevelt
is a Communist, like it was a piece they learned at school."</p>

<p>Ed Oleson was eager. "You ask <i>me</i> about the Federal Club!
I go there all the time, to shave the upper-bracket crooks when
they got too big a hang-over to walk. Oh, a lot of 'em are okay;
Webb Wargate is a real constructive citizen, and Judge
Blackstaff&mdash;he's just as good a judge as your boss, George,
and tips you four bits, like a gentleman. But Prutt, the banker, he
never gives you a cent&mdash;explains they don't tip, in a club.
Hell, I ain't a club servant; I got my own independent business and
I don't have to shave any cactus-faced old gentleman-virgin unless
I feel like it.</p>

<p>"But the worst guy there is that Boone Havock. Say, why decent
people ever let him in their houses is beyond me. I've been called
in to shave that cut-throat when he was so drunk he couldn't go
home and had to take a room at the club, and he told and
volunteered and told me that he'd spent the night with a tart in a
shack down in the South End and then got her cockeyed and cheated
her out of her five bucks, and he boasted about it.</p>

<p>"My son Tracy, that works for Wargate, has got more brains and
financial savvy than the whole club put together. By the way, Tracy
knows Judge Timberlane's bride; says she's a high-class girl. And
talking of wives, I'm like Leo here: my old girl and I have a swell
time, especially now the kids are grown up. We go out hunting and
canoeing like a couple of Indians. That's the kind of a wife I
like."</p>

<p>George Hame rose, jeering, "Glad to hear there's so many
square-shooting wives around this burg. I congratulate you
boys."</p>

<p>The bailiff, also rising: "Same here. Fellows that 're out from
behind the matrimonial eight-ball like you two must have money to
spare. We'll allow you to pay for the drinks."</p>

<p>Jensing crowed, "Just to prove it, I <i>will</i> buy 'em!"</p>

<p>"Any time you're in for rape, Leo, just remind me that I used to
know you, and I'll get the Judge to let you off with life," said
Hame. "Good night."<br>
<br></p>

<p>Bailiff Bellile, as he entered his brown Cape Cod cottage,
waited for his wife to say, "Have you wiped your feet? I try so
hard to keep things nice here, and then you come home drunk and get
everything all dirty."</p>

<p>She said it.</p>

<p>She waited for him to say, in echo of his days as a lumber-camp
teamster, "I wish to God I <i>were</i> drunk, and maybe it wouldn't
make me so sick to look at you."</p>

<p>He said it.<br>
<br></p>

<p>Ed Oleson went noisily into his upstairs half of a two-family
house, and his aging wife chirped, "It's the old master himself.
Have a good time with the boys?"</p>

<p>"I'll say! Wish you'd been along."</p>

<p>"Whyntcha invite me?"</p>

<p>"Juvecome?"</p>

<p>"Try it and see! Bet I would. Smell something nice?"</p>

<p>"And how! What is it?"</p>

<p>"Real Hunky goulash."</p>

<p>"Now you don't tell me." He kissed her.</p>

<p>"Nice time in the shop today?"</p>

<p>"Fellow here from Rochester, New York, he told me all about how
we'll lick the Japs with a secret weapon we got. Say, I'll bet
Tracy 'll be in the war, and be a major."</p>

<p>"If his lungs are all healed up. Golly, Ed, aren't you proud of
that boy!"</p>

<p>"Say, don't you quote me and don't let the newspapers get hold
of it, but I'm nuts about him. The damn little hick&mdash;think of
him&mdash; headed for the top of the Wargate Corporation some
day!"</p>

<p>"And let me tell you, Mr. Ed Oleson, they'll be lucky to get
him!"</p>

<p>"I'll say. How about lassoing that goulash now?"</p>

<p>"I think you got something there, Mister. Let's go!"<br>
<br></p>

<p>There was no ugly noise between George Hame and his wife, Ethel,
when he came coldly into their freight-car of a house, but only an
uglier silence. That was agreeable to him, because there was for
him a poisonous boredom in what he considered her spiritless and
hopeless fussing, her whimpering demands for money.</p>

<p>He looked at her over the Dumas he was always reading. She was
hemming a pot-holder made of red calico.</p>

<p>"Much too bright for her," he muttered.</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Nothing...You certainly will drive me nuts."</p>

<p>"What say?"</p>

<p>"Nothing."</p>

<p>Then another baby yelled. They had five of them, and all
unwanted. But there was also their fifteen-year-old daughter,
Betty, whom he loved.</p>

<p>He said placidly, "All I exist for is to supply you with brats
and lactation."</p>

<p>"And whose fault&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yours. If you'd take a little care of yourself&mdash;As
Montaigne observes, this place is always obscene with new dripping
babies, and smells like wet death."</p>

<p>She knew enough then not to speak. When he mentioned
Montaigne&mdash; pronounced Montaigny&mdash;he was likely to hit
her with his seal ring.</p>

<p>Betty came in, round and pert as a bouncing tennis ball.</p>

<p>"Hello, Daddy," she said, as she raced for the stairs, and
"Hello, sweetheart" he answered, looking up after her new nylon
stockings and old shoes.</p>

<p>His wife was afraid not to speak now. "George! I will not have
you looking at Betty that way!"</p>

<p>"So you will not have it! So what?"</p>

<p>He returned to Dumas.</p>

<p>Some day, he thought, Betty and he would run off together to
France, to the shrine of Dumas. She looked much older than fifteen,
didn't she? He dreamed about this always, and always knew that he
would never do it. He knew that he would hold to his wife. She
irritated him, but he was lonely without her on the evenings when
she was visiting her incessantly sick relatives and Betty was out
with one of the neighborhood boys whom he hated. He was lonely not
because he had no treasures in himself, for he could renew them out
of Dumas or Scott or Washington Irving, nor because he could not
take comfort in solitude, but because he was afraid that when Betty
discovered how he felt toward her and vituperatively left him
forever, then no one in the world but Ethel would stay by him, no
one else would blame it on Betty.</p>

<p>He guessed that Judge Timberlane would kick him out, if the
Judge discovered his thoughts about Betty, and he was sorry,
because, though he considered the Judge a little too naive, he also
believed him to be the Archangel Michael.</p>

<p>With the firmness of the will to death, he waited for Betty to
come down and pass through the room again. The other children
panted in and out, but their noise was so blurred that it was to
him like an absolute silence.</p>

<p>"Don't you want any supper?" grated his wife.</p>

<p>"What? I suppose so. I never thought about it...Oh, Betty, going
out? Get home early now, sweetheart I'll sit up for you."</p>

<p>"Swell, Daddy," she condescended.</p>

<p>Then he felt gay, and he looked amiably at his wife. When he saw
her expression, he froze and returned to Dumas.</p>

<h2>Chapter 25</h2>

<p>That they should return to Grand Republic on an early January
day when the sun came out after a snowstorm, that Mrs. Higbee
should be at the door to greet the young chatelaine, that flowers
should have come from Diantha Marl and Bradd Criley, and a shaker
of already-mixed cocktails from Queenie Havock, that Jinny should
coo, "Bergheim is an awfully stately old place, isn't it!" was all
so exactly the Judge's idea of what was fitting that it bothered
him. There was no responsible worrying to be done!</p>

<p>Cleo, now a proud young cat, came galloping hysterically
downstairs when she heard their voices. Then she pretended that she
didn't even know them, but had just happened to be passing that
way. In fact she stayed about for an hour, to make sure that they
saw how she ignored them.</p>

<p>They were content, but they found the town in the war.</p>

<p>Even the citizens who six weeks before had said, "We're going to
mind our own business and not get into any war" were declaring, "We
ought to have gone to Great Britain's aid two years ago, but now
we're in, and we won't quit till Hitler and Hirohito are wiped
out."</p>

<p>Eino Roskinen, Curtiss Havock, Jack Prutt, and Jamie Wargate,
Webb's second-oldest boy, were already in uniform as privates, and
Tom Crenway, in escape from his anesthetically amorous Violet, was
a major. Violet herself was the rival of Diantha Marl and Della
Lent for leadership of women's war activities: Red Cross, Civilian
Defense, scrap-collection. Of the Brothers-in-Law, Inc., the
spouses of the Zebra Sisters, Alfred Umbaugh was now a colonel in
the department of supplies, and his Zeta was adequately managing
his Button Bright Stores chain, while Harold W. Whittick, the
advertising man, had taken over the patriotism of Grand Republic as
once he had taken over its future.</p>

<p>All of these were anxious and faithful, but there was comedy in
the case of that absentee warrior, Fred Nimbus of Station
<i>kich</i>.</p>

<p>On December 10, ult., young Mr. Nimbus had begun a biweekly
series of radio stories about the adventures of the Marines, in
which he was author, director, and star. They were so lively that
even a few Marines liked them, and there was a general feeling
abroad that Mr. Nimbus, in his studio, was the most daring warrior
in the state and that upon hearing his voice, thousands of Japanese
dashed up the palm trees.</p>

<p>All of this the Timberlanes learned as they were starting their
career as a decorous and settled Young Couple.<br>
<br></p>

<p>Two days after their return, the cold wave struck; the
thermometer was at ten, fifteen, twenty-two degrees below zero; all
the separate lawns turned into one snowfield, as though the cold
prairie had taken over the town; and snow-devils whirled across
them. No matter how they wrapped in fur and wool, their foreheads
could not be protected from the aching sting of the cold. But
before Jinny could moan for the ease and freedom of the Florida
warmth, Cass had her out on skis, flying down the Ottawa Hill, and
they were triumphant and alive.<br>
<br></p>

<p>He expected Jinny to turn Bergheim into a magazine supplement,
and he was financially armed for it. He had been living on his
salary as judge and saving the three or four thousand dollars a
year that came from the rents which he had inherited from his
father.</p>

<p>"Go to it," he said. "Kick out any of the old furniture that
gets impertinent to you."</p>

<p>"No. I'm not going to change hardly a thing." She spoke with a
new and matronly responsibility. "I'll just refurnish my own
room&mdash; which I love, by the way; it's so light, with such a
view over the valley. But the rest of the house, the old things
belong to it."</p>

<p>He admired and wondered.</p>

<p>"And then, too, all your friends will be expecting the child
bride to raise Cain with the household gods, and it's our duty to
fool 'em."</p>

<p>He wondered and adored.</p>

<p>"And why waste the money now? Some day soon we'll get a lovely
new modern house of our own, with no smell of Eisenherz furs and
sauerkraut."</p>

<p>He adored and fretted.</p>

<p>Her notion of a "lovely new house" would cost a great deal of
money. But it did not occur to him to refuse.</p>

<p>She was as practical as laundry soap. Her newly decked room did
have a flowery dressing-table with twenty-two small and rather
redundant bottles and jars of cosmetics, urban and extremely
expensive, but the walls betrayed the small-town girl in its sheaf
of photographs and souvenirs: Jinny Marshland at six, with kitten;
Cousin Joe Marshland, who was now an insurance agent in Gopher
Prairie; Douglas Fairbanks as a movie bandit; Eino and Tracy in
astounding straw hats; the program of the Pioneer Falls High School
Commencement Exercises, May, 1934, silver print on scarlet paper,
class motto "Per Aspera ad Astra," salutatorian, Miss Virginia
Marshland.</p>

<p>While her own retreat was being redecorated, she was generously
invited to lodge with Cass, and when she crept into his room, her
bare feet in woolly slippers like white rabbits, and slipped into
his monumental bed, they clutched at each other with a stimulating
feeling of danger and wickedness.</p>

<p>Lying with one leg impudently cocked in the air, her toes
wriggling, she crooned, "I am Judge Timberlane's little
mistress."</p>

<p>"Jinny!"</p>

<p>"And the proudest of his Circassian slaves. The concubines of
the seven Kings of Blackstaff envy my breastplate of onyx and my
Abyssinian lace slacks."</p>

<p>"Why, Jinny!"</p>

<p>"Does it shock you when I say I'm your mistress?"</p>

<p>"Well, not&mdash;uh&mdash;not <i>shock</i> me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I see, Venerable. You mean it merely <i>shocks</i> you!"</p>

<p>"Yes, it does!"</p>

<p>She giggled.</p>

<p>He was sorry when she grandly started to sleep in her own
virtuous-looking narrow bed. Somehow he was afraid to go unbidden
into her room, as she never was to enter his.</p>

<p>To her maidenly room he added one gift: a white fur rug. She
used to sit with her folded bare feet deep in its fleecy warmth,
and talk about immortality.<br>
<br></p>

<p>In the rooms other than her own, her practicality was evident.
She had more floor-plugs put in, and replaced the old lamps, which
resembled moth-eaten velvet mosques erected upon bronze crutches,
with lamps of simple shafts and clear parchment shades. She
dismissed teak thrones, and ponderous curtains that for generations
had been the graveyards of flies and lightning-bugs. The house
suddenly had more light and air and gaiety, and at night you did
not fall over relics.</p>

<p>And she installed a popcorn shaker, an electric drink-mixer, an
electric washing-machine, a set of dominoes...</p>

<p>Her one Bohemian extravagance as an artist was a highly
modernist design which she drew on the inside of the downstairs
coat-closet door, in gold radiator-paint and two shades of red
nail-polish. It showed two angels, one holding a banner lettered
"C" and one with a "J," joyfully flying together. It agitated the
more sober citizenry, but to Cass it was a major work.<br>
<br></p>

<p>He had at last the chance to complete her instruction in
chess.</p>

<p>It was an edifying and domestic sight: the large man in a
doubtful brown-flannel dressing-gown and red slippers; the girl in
quilted pink silk, with her small white woolly slippers; the board
and the old ivory pieces which Cass's father had bought in San
Francisco; all before the fire in the library, where now a clearer
light displayed the blue buckram set of "The World's Most
Distinguished Legal Orations, with Sketches of Leaders of the Bench
and Bar, Profusely Illustrated."</p>

<p>Jinny took to chess with zeal and lawlessness. She began with an
eloquent prejudice against the rooks.</p>

<p>She was a true animist; she believed that all inanimate
objects&mdash; gloves, flatirons, automobiles, stars, lilies, pork
chops&mdash;had souls and that all animals had human intelligence;
and furthermore she almost one-quarter believed in her own
belief.</p>

<p>Brooding over the chessmen, she said that the rooks were
smug-looking and flat-headed, with stubbly cropped hair, and she
scolded them for loafing in the home rank all through the hottest
of the game, and then sneaking out to kidnap some bishop who had
been working hard and taking risks, and who looked so slim and neat
and friendly.</p>

<p>She developed a surrealist criticism of the chess-rules. Why
shouldn't a king be able to castle under check?</p>

<p>"Because it's the rule," said Judge Timberlane.</p>

<p>"Why is it the rule?"</p>

<p>"Because it is!"</p>

<p>"Look, silly," she explained. "The king, bless his poor scared
heart&mdash;the way he has to skip around, with even these G.I.
pawns threatening to bump him off all the time&mdash;and so when
he's in check, when he's in danger and really <i>needs</i> to
castle, then you won't let him! Why not?"</p>

<p>"Because it's the&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Who ever made the rule?"</p>

<p>"Heavens, I don't know. I suppose some old Persian."</p>

<p>"Persians make rugs. They don't make rules."</p>

<p>"Well, this one did."</p>

<p>"How do you know he was a Persian? How do you know he was
old?"</p>

<p>"I don't." She was so spirited a debater, so much more
belligerent an advocate than any Hervey Plint or Vincent Osprey,
that by now he was half-serious.</p>

<p>"You don't know? Then maybe there isn't any such a rule! Maybe
you just dreamed it."</p>

<p>"Well, good Lord, all players keep it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How do you know they do? Did you ever see Capablanca or Reuben
Fine refuse to castle just because a king was being bullied by some
mean bishop? (And I used to <i>like</i> the bishops, silly girl
that I was, but now I'm onto them.) Did you?"</p>

<p>"Of course I didn't. I've never seen any master play."</p>

<p>"There! Maybe there isn't any such a rule. Maybe they only have
it in Minnesota. We're wonderful in Minnesota about wheat and iron
and removing gall-stones, but what right have we got to dictate to
the rest of the world about castling?"</p>

<p>"Dear idiot child, you'll be asking next how I know you and I
are really married, and who made up the marriage code."</p>

<p>"I do ask it! How do you know we aren't living in sin, according
to the Mohammedans?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Maybe I ought to walk right out of here, and go to living with
Abby Tubbs or Jay Laverick or Senator Hudbury, or my sweet Bertie.
What's to prevent it?"</p>

<p>"Only me and a shotgun."</p>

<p>"You see? You only believe in violence; you don't believe in the
rules of marriage&mdash;or of my not castling, either!"</p>

<p>"Just the same, you can't castle."</p>

<p>"Bully!"</p>

<p>"Get on with the game, and don't be so reasonable. A girl that
would criticize the corpus of chess-laws would criticize
chastity."</p>

<p>"I'm not sure that's so hot, either."</p>

<p>"Get on with the game!"</p>

<p>But the real debate&mdash;and he was never quite sure that there
was not some reality at the core of her pretended rebellions
against Authority&mdash;came when he first revealed to her, from
among the more appalling secret human motives, that by creeping up
to the eighth rank, his pawn had suddenly become a queen, and that
she was thus about to be checkmated.</p>

<p>"That's the most ridiculous claim I ever heard in my life! Why?
Now don't tell me it's the rule. It can't be. I know that pawn.
It's got a tiny nick in its head." (This was true, though Cass had
never noticed it.) "It's an unusually stupid, uncooperative pawn.
It <i>never</i> could be a queen. Impossible! I won't recognize the
government!"</p>

<p>"Don't you like rules, Jinny?"</p>

<p>"Well, I like you."</p>

<p>"Let me be didactic, Jin."</p>

<p>"Okay."</p>

<p>"Don't say 'Okay'!"</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"It sounds like a gum-chewer."</p>

<p>"But I am a gum-chewer."</p>

<p>"You are not, and you're not going to be. Look. I don't bully
you about many things&mdash;I'd like to, but I'm too scared of you.
But I want each of us to teach the other something of his attitude:
me teach you that there's satisfaction in being a sober grind and
mastering even a game, like chess; and you teach me that there's
nothing legally wrong about letting go and just having a good time.
Can't we?"</p>

<p>They gravely shook hands on it, seeing before them the white
highway of pious self-instruction whereon every day in every way
they would get not only better but more blithe; assured that he
would become a first-class grasshopper and she one of the most
social-minded ants in the whole three-foot mountain.</p>

<p>She said, with a slight shade of reverence, "When you lecture
me, you sound like a real judge on the bench."</p>

<p>"Does it annoy you?"</p>

<p>"I love it. You know, pal, I'm not too sure I'm going to win
this battle of marriage. I get around you by being the gay 'ittle
girl&mdash; the blasted little gold-digger!&mdash;but you're too
accurate and dependable for me."</p>

<p>"And sometimes I'm fun, ain't I?"</p>

<p>"Ye-es, sometimes&mdash;oh, quite often."</p>

<p>"But you won't lose the battle, Jin. The worthy blacksmith
hasn't much chance against Ariel."</p>

<p>"You're balled up in your mythology, Judge. Ariel was not a
girl."</p>

<p>"Which you distinctly are, my dear."</p>

<p>There was something in the smile with which she acknowledged
this alluring fact which made him blush. Then, like a cat, her head
low and a little sidewise, she cautiously stalked a pawn with her
queen's bishop, and pounced.<br>
<br></p>

<p>Cass wondered where he had heard the theory that people,
especially women, who are too devoted to animals are more callous
toward human beings. Was it a folk tale or reasoned observation or
spite, or all three? Remembering it, he was slightly worried, in a
husbandly way, that Jinny was so ecstatic over all animals, from
the mounted policemen's horses and the elephant in Wargate Park Zoo
to the lone goldfish in a bowl which she sheepishly brought home
from the Five and Ten.</p>

<p>To Cleo she gave an attention which gratified that bland and
conceited cat. She maintained that Cleo had to have the best liver,
the sweetbread meant by Mrs. Higbee for the Master, and a menagerie
of catnip mice. For Cleo she busily knitted a set of mittens, red
mittens edged with yellow, each the size of a large thimble, for
walks in the snow. When they were tried out, Cleo merely kicked off
three of them, but the fourth she pounced on with a yell and chewed
to pieces, while Jinny looked forlorn.</p>

<p>The gift of a gold string from some ancient Christmas package
was Jinny's greatest success. This was Cleo's private string, daily
rescued from the wood-box or a pan of batter or a toilet, and
coiled beside her pink wicker basket, near the kitchen stove. She
leaped into the air to clutch it, and furiously got snarled in it,
and in it was suspended from the back of a chair. She spent hours
hiding under curtains, wagging herself, trying to catch the string
napping.</p>

<p>Jinny also acquired, within three months, a tragic-eyed
cocker-spaniel pup named Alfred, who was terrified of Cleo, a
canary which every night Cleo tried to eat, a depraved and
miserable lizard, and two lambs made of wool and pretty
inactive.</p>

<p>Jinny loved them all and tried to get them to love one another,
with about the usual success of missionaries ever since Jonah.</p>

<p>Cass wished, sometimes, that in addition to the gay affection
which Jinny gave him, he could have the yearning she poured on Cleo
and on that faker and love-beggar, the dog Alfred.</p>

<p>Except when they differed over Jinny's purloining the Master's
coming dinner for Cleo, Mrs. Higbee was Jinny's ally in spoiling
every mangy feline and hound in the neighborhood, and Cass always
had a suspicion that somewhere in the labyrinthian basement of
Bergheim the two women were concealing lost and very valuable
pigeons, panthers, and hippopotami.</p>

<p>From his bedroom he heard them conspiring again, in Jinny's
cave.</p>

<p>"Miss Jinny, now you got that new traveling clock, why don't you
let me have this red celluloid one for the kitchen? Kitchen clock
don't keep time."</p>

<p>"Oh, I couldn't, Mrs. Higbee, I simply couldn't! I've had my
little red clock for four years. It came from Pioneer Falls with
me, and it waked me every single morning when I was on the job at
the factory. Its feelings would be dreadfully hurt if I exiled it
to the kitchen."</p>

<p>"Maybe something to that. We'll get the Judge to buy us a new
one."</p>

<p>He came out of hiding to examine the two witches: "I'll bet both
of you believe in palmistry and astrology."</p>

<p>"Doesn't every nice woman?" challenged Jinny.</p>

<p>Mrs. Higbee reflected, "I don't believe in any of those things.
but it's awful funny what you find in a person's hand."</p>

<p>The witches, primitive and powerful, looked at each other
darkly, with contempt for the shallowness of this childish
inquistor with his books and his pride in reasoning.<br>
<br></p>

<p>In early spring, Alfred the dog died suddenly of cat-fur, only a
few weeks after his appearance in history. Cass expected hysteria
from Jinny, and plans for a torchlight funeral, but she said
absently. "He was such a nice pup; sorry he went. But, darling,
let's not have another dog for a while. I'm not sure&mdash;she's
too polite to show it&mdash;but I think Cleo is annoyed by dogs.
They get so noisy when she merely wants to tease them a
little."<br>
<br></p>

<p><b>An Assemblage of Husbands and Wives</b>
</p>

<p><i>Sabine Grossenwahn</i>
</p>

<p>Years ago, when Boone Havock was not a railroad-builder but a
saloon bouncer, a thoroughly worthless brother had followed him to
Minnesota and there died in the odor of rye whisky, leaving a
luscious-limbed and just slightly nymphomaniac daughter named
Sabine in charge of Boone, who was very rigid and moral about
women, that is, if they were his daughters or nieces. He sent
Sabine to Sunday school, and in 1929, when she was eighteen, he
shipped her East, to a fine rustling school in the Hudson
Valley.</p>

<p>At a dance she met and in a dance she married one Ferdinand
Grossenwahn, a fat, fifty-ridden New York stockbroker who was later
known to Sabine's friends as "Pore Ole Ferdy." On the evening of
her wedding-day, she slipped away for an hour with a handsome
dancing-man whom she had met that afternoon, and when Ferdy found
them and was stuffy about it, she slapped him.</p>

<p>As soon as she had succeeded in the new feminine career of
lucratively divorcing her husband, she returned to Grand Republic,
where her waved hair, delicate as a sea shell, her sables, and her
fifteen-hundred-a-month alimony were greater rarities than in
Manhattan.</p>

<p>Besides the alimony, Pore Ole Ferdy had given her a
fifty-thousand-dollar cash bonus for leaving him in peace and
dignity, and she built a house known throughout Minnesota as
"Alimony Hall." It was in the shape of a double L, and the leafy
courtyard, on the bluff overhanging the Sorshay River valley, was
full all summer long of ivy and syringa and rose-bushes, of
glass-topped tables and plaid table-parasols and wheeled
reclining-chairs like portable divans, with an outdoor grill and an
outdoor bar; full of laughter and swing music on the phonograph and
women who wanted sympathy and men who called it that. It is to be
said for Sabine's good nature that, provided they did not attack
her own current young man, she was almost as willing to provide
secluded rooms for her women friends and their affairs as for her
own.</p>

<p>Most frequent of the Alimony Hall Set were Jay Laverick, Harley
Bozard, Cousin Curtiss Havock, Bradd Criley, Fred Nimbus, Norton
Trock&mdash;but he never bothered women&mdash;Gillian Brown, who
despised Sabine, Cerise, consort of that earnest young legal prig,
Vincent Osprey, and, somewhat disapprovingly, Rose Pennloss.</p>

<p>Norton Trock dated himself by quoting Omar Khayyam at their
gatherings, but the talk ran oftener to adultery and gin than to
wine and roses.</p>

<p>None of them, except Sabine, Harley, and Cousin Curtiss, who had
met him briefly in New York, had ever seen Pore Ole Ferdy
Grossenwahn, but they all talked as though he were their oppressive
and ridiculous uncle. They referred to her alimony as "our income."
While Sabine and Gillian giggled, they debated whether Ferdy was
worth more to them living or dead, for Sabine had assured them, "I
honestly do think that if the old fool doesn't get married again,
he will at least have the decency to leave me everything in his
will."</p>

<p>They laughed while she told them about Ferdy's fat amorousness,
or read them his current letters, which betrayed him by such
puerile phrases as, "Though I never could satisfy you &amp; I sure
was not worthy of your spiritual gifts and bright way of talking,
you must admit that my solicitude for you is unwavering &amp; sure
can count on me always, dear babe o' mine, for such financial
assistance as able."</p>

<p>During her affair with Fred Nimbus, who was a couple of years
younger than herself and a fine athletic radio-announcer, it amused
both of them that her stupid ex-husband would not even know that he
was supporting her lover. "Mustn't be jealous of Pore Ole Ferdy or
talk naughty about him," she whispered to Fred. "You don't think he
was romantic, but he certainly is contributing to a high-class
romance now. So shut up and kiss me."</p>

<p>Sabine was not so simple in her moods that she always ridiculed
Pore Ole Ferdy. Sometimes for a whole week she spoke of him with
repentant reverence: "All of you shut your traps about Ferdy. I'm
not altogether sold on the idea that he wasn't worthy of me. God
knows he was hard to live with, and a cold fish, but he always
treated me with the most scrup'lous honor, and in fact he's a
perfect gentleman, and I want to tell you that there's no man on
the Exchange that has a more prophetic sense about a bear-market
than Ferdy."</p>

<p>But sometimes, to show that she was no parasite weakling, she
was resentful and firm with Ferdy. He once wrote that he was
hard-up and would like to reduce her "income" for a month or two,
and she had the courage and sense of responsibility to answer, "All
this is a matter of court record, and if you haven't got the dough
now, that's just too bad! And you better hustle around and get it,
not do the cry-baby act! I don't know what's gotten into you. I
think it might help you come to your senses if you took this right
into court. You seem to forget you took on an <i>obligation</i> in
our legal settlement, and I don't intend to let you try and avoid
it. I have been faithful to our agreement and I expect you to be
the same."</p>

<p>When Norton Trock explained the idea of the matriarchy to her,
Sabine said, "Thank God that could never happen in America."</p>

<h2>Chapter 26</h2>

<p>This happy man and woman, this little world, this precious
island in a leaden sea, walled from the envy of less happier homes,
this blessed trust, this peace, this youthful marriage, this home
of such dear souls, this dear dear home.</p>

<p>This valley of refuge, this refuge without flight, this valley
shelter from the wars abroad and the hysteric factions of the land,
this close and smiling cheer, this dear dear home.</p>

<p>Thus only could Cass read his Richard the Second.<br>
<br></p>

<p>If the world of the twentieth century, he vowed, cannot succeed
in this one thing, married love, then it has committed suicide, all
but the last moan, and whether Germany and France can live as
neighbors is insignificant compared with whether Johann and Maria
or Jean and Marie can live as lovers. He knew that with each decade
such serenity was more difficult, with Careers for Women opening
equally on freedom and on a complex weariness. But whether women
worked in the kitchen or in the machine-shop, married love must be
a shelter, or the world would freeze, out in the bleak free
prairies of irresponsible love-making.</p>

<p>With whatever flaws, his dear Jinny and he had created such a
shelter. He hastened back to her from his day in court; she
hastened to him from her war work in the Office of Civilian
Defense, or from a French lesson with Frau Silbersee, or from a
movie with Rose and Valerie Pennloss. He met her with a perpetually
renewed amazement that this brisk and well-armored girl would
soften to his love. She met him with astonishment that so reserved
a man should be so without reserve her worshiper.</p>

<p>They walked on winter nights by the dark river flowing under the
ice from dark pinelands; they panted home to read in quiet, with
one final ferocious game of chess, and she came into his room to
say good night and forgot to go.</p>

<p>Poor Cass was so much simpler than most of the criminals who
appeared before his wisdom, and any beslobbered pickpocket knew
more about the intrigue of love. He suffered from thinking that his
was an entirely reasonable, realistic, unsentimental love&mdash;in
fact, he suffered from thinking, while Nature was busy with much
livelier urges.</p>

<p>So great was her kindness toward his stumbling and beautiful
faith in her that Jinny was not tempted to tease him by keeping him
away, but she was human enough to bully him. It was in timing that
she could, with innocent sweetness, most bedevil him.</p>

<p>He was invariably ready to do whatever she wanted to when she
wanted; she usually thought that what he wanted to do was a fair
notion, but she always showed her independence by delaying the
<i>when</i>. She was always ten minutes late, always had been and
always would be, and he always protested that she was late, and she
always explained that her watch was slow, and the ever-refreshing
topic was probably a safety-valve and kept them from more perilous
matrimonial topics, such as relatives, religion, and the vanity of
too-much lipstick.</p>

<p>He had to face the twin questions of whether she could settle
down with his staid set, and whether that set would snub her as an
outsider and not come calling. But the entire town (again meaning
one per cent of it) was frenzied to know what this girl was like
who had captured Our Cass. They did come, and Jinny was pleased,
even when she was irritated by the manner of the older worthies,
which indicated, "We shall make every effort to have you accepted
by our senate, now that you are no longer young and wild, but we
must be convinced that you appreciate it."</p>

<p>Queenie Havock came in, at the most inconvenient time available,
just when Jinny had started to wash her hair, and gave Jinny
instructions on how to keep Cass ardent, and charged into the
kitchen, said it was too large and too old-fashioned, insulted Mrs.
Higbee, and then won her back by screaming, "Here I am shooting off
my mouth again, but I know what a crank Cass is about temperance
and purity and all that hooey, the old stiff, and you two girls
have to live with him, and I just meant any time I can tip you off
about men, you let me know, and how would you like a brace of
frozen pheasants?"</p>

<p>Less endurable was Diantha Marl, Mrs. Gregory Marl, the handsome
and fresh-voiced and amiable. Both as the wife of the Banner and in
her own right as a committeewoman, a madame chairman, an exhaustive
and exhausting talker about foreign affairs, the drama, and the
illegitimate babies that all the gayer young ladies in town were
certainly going to have immediately, Diantha ranked with Mrs. Webb
Wargate, Madge Dedrick, and Della Lent as one of the female rulers
of the tribe.</p>

<p>She had worked so hard at an English accent that she had
acquired a fascinating combination of Oxford and oxcart, and she
was so mannered, so pretentious, that when she met you on the
street and said "Good morning," it somehow informed you that she
was on her way to a conference with the Secretary of State or with
Bernard Shaw, who had secretly slipped into town for that
purpose.</p>

<p>She remembered that Jinny had once worked for her
husband&mdash;how she remembered it! how glowingly and inescapably
she remembered it!&mdash; and, under her system of private
imperialism, she assumed the right to inflict on Jinny, as one of
her smaller colonies, a rule of gentle questioning, which would
provide her with new dinner-party tattle.</p>

<p>Jinny, proud in her power as young hostess, who could give
orders to Mrs. Higbee and often have them carried out, offered
Diantha tea or cocktails. She took cocktails, and began to
whinny.</p>

<p>How cozy here. Did Cass tell Jinny all about his cases in
court?</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," lied Jinny.</p>

<p>Did Cass like to play with her, and was he a generous
provider?</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," said Jinny, surprised at being able to tell the
truth.</p>

<p>What was Cass's worst fault?</p>

<p>"Why, I imagine it's his thinking that his wife is so bright
that she's onto it when people who really dislike her pretend to
shine up to her."</p>

<p>Not for months did Diantha decide whether Jinny had meant to be
insulting. She then, very erroneously, decided No.</p>

<p>She ran through a discourse on the post-war education of Germany
(which ought to be taken over by liberal-minded women like Diantha
Marl), on trout-fishing (she was one of the best fly-casters in
Radisson County), and on what a creeping imbecile Perry Claywheel
was to believe that his wife was true to him. So Diantha got easily
through the period before she could go home and tell a dinner-party
that this Jinny Timberlane was illiterate but harmless.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Nestor Purdwin, wife of the dean of the local bar, just
brought Jinny a jar of chutney, and that rangy older hawk, Mrs.
Judge Blackstaff, came and sat and knitted with Jinny, who was glad
then to believe that she herself would some day become an authentic
Mrs. Judge.<br>
<br></p>

<p>As a planner, a maker of notes and lists, Cass had anxiously
thought over all the younger people whom Jinny might like. He was
pleased when the Havocks' daughter, Ellen Olliford, came home from
Massachusetts. She was just Jinny's age, and everybody said she was
"so amusing."</p>

<p>They would be Great Friends, decided Cass.</p>

<p>Ellen Havock had gone to Smith College, then married Mr.
Olliford, an engineer resident in Springfield, Massachusetts, now
in the service, a captain. Ellen, with her one baby, had come back
to stay with her parents.</p>

<p>She loved and despised her parents, she loved and was bored by
Grand Republic, and she spread abroad the news that Springfield
(Mass.) was a heavenly city compact with music, French cuisine,
silver golf-sticks and bridge-cards beaten out of fine gold, till
her father said&mdash;but still lovingly&mdash;"Then why the hell
don't you get out of this hick camp and go back to your
codfish?"</p>

<p>Jinny was more terrified by Ellen than by Ellen's strident
mother. Young Mrs. Olliford was so artificially slim, so icy, so at
ease, so inquisitive; and without saying it, she so clearly said to
Jinny, "How did a country girl like you ever marry a man who,
however far down the rungs, still belongs to our International
Ladder Society?"</p>

<p>Half a dozen other young war-widows also came reluctantly back
to the primitiveness of their native Grand Republic, after marrying
into such exclusive Eastern centers of culture as Peoria,
Bridgeport, and Scranton. They knew their horse-shows and their
Vogue fashions, and Jinny was as uncomfortable with them as any
other fox-terrier with a pack of disdainful greyhounds. None of
this did Cass realize; he thought that Ellen and her kind were
"nice kids, maybe a little too extravagant," who would be grateful
to meet anyone so forthright and individual as Jinny. When she
said, no, she did not want to give a party for them, he dismissed
them with a comfortable "You're probably right. How about some
cribbage?"</p>

<p>Not too discontentedly, he thought, Jinny settled down with Lyra
Coggs, Francia Wolke, Cerise Osprey, Hortense Hubbs, Rose Pennloss
and, perhaps most of all, with Rose's daughter Valerie who, at
fifteen, seemed to Jinny to have more eagerness and integrity than
anyone she knew except Cass and Eino.<br>
<br></p>

<p>Webb and Louise Wargate, home early from Florida because of the
war, gave the Timberlanes a formal party, but of that Jinny could
remember nothing except white shirt-fronts, a swirl of tulle, and
the magnificent, the absurd, Great Room in the Wargate palace, with
its enormous crimson circular seat with an orange tree on the
central pedestal, and the marble fountain imported from Italy.</p>

<p>Their real welcome to matrimony was the dinner of twelve persons
given by Dr. and Mrs. Drover.</p>

<p>Jinny had, with difficulty, persuaded Cass that it would be
fashionable for them to be ten minutes late, so when they came
in&mdash; two minutes early&mdash;the citizens had all arrived, and
Cass could hear Roy and Queenie in an antiphon that seemed
familiar:</p>

<p>Nobody at all has any servants whatsoever now, and those who do
have pay too much, and so all strikes ought to be stopped by law,
because all labor leaders and Democrats are crooks. Cass listened
while he waited for Jinny to return from the coat-room, and
silently exploded.</p>

<p>&mdash;Dear Jinny, I've done a dreadful thing, to trick you into
becoming my wife and, for your reward, let you for a whole evening
listen to Roy Drover belching. I must have hated you, not loved
you. I've shut you in a morgue. Well, I'll take you out of it. I'll
take us both out! I'd better, little hawk, or you'll fly off
without me!</p>

<p>&mdash;Now what kind of a way to talk is that? Jinny is a
wise-enough kid to know that these people are the salt of the
earth, the friendliest and solidest people living. What the devil!
They're not <i>supposed</i> to talk like a bunch of actors or
professors!</p>

<p>He had got so far in his inward scolding when Chris Grau walked
in, with scarf, and looked at him straight&mdash;not rebukingly,
not pathetically, not tenderly, just straight, her manner saying
that he had gone rather far, not so long ago, in making love to
her, in drinking in her sympathy, and there was nothing that could
be done about it, but she did want to have the record clear.</p>

<p>The Judge quit brooding and became practical. Leaving Jinny
comparatively safe with Rose Pennloss and a cocktail, he appealed
to Lillian Drover, the hostess. She smiled beseechingly at him, as
she always did. "Lil! Can you seat Jinny beside Bradd Criley at
dinner&mdash;he'll entertain her more than anybody, I
think&mdash;and let me sit by Chris? I've neglected her."</p>

<p>Lillian blushed and nodded.</p>

<p>He bustled to Bradd. Good ole Bradd! Thirty-nine now but hard to
believe it, still looks about twenty-nine; wavy-haired, impudently
courtly, handsome in a track-athlete way, slim as a tennis-player,
master of every trick of the law court and the poker table and the
boudoir, a more smiling friend than Roy Drover and a more sensible
one than Frank Brightwing&mdash;no wonder he held that ducal office
of The Most Popular Bachelor in Town!</p>

<p>Cass urged, "Bradd! Pay some attention to Jin tonight. She's shy
of these old crabs, and I've got to soothe Chris."</p>

<p>The dimple, the quick smile, the manly voice, as Bradd promised,
"Do you think I'll find that hard? Jinny is the one person here,
besides you, that I want to see. I'm delighted that you and she are
so happy together. And you can hold her. She'd be onto a flashy guy
like me in ten minutes. You watch me squire her."</p>

<p>Good ole Bradd, thought Cass.</p>

<p>Sitting beside Chris at dinner, he probed, "Well, what do we
say?"</p>

<p>"About what?"</p>

<p>"About us."</p>

<p>"You mean about letting me think you loved me, and then sneaking
off with this girl?"</p>

<p>"Not sneaking."</p>

<p>"Sneaking!...Well, I must say, but regretfully, that I think you
were right."</p>

<p>"M?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Cass, I know; I had no youthful passion left to give you.
It all went to my father, then for years to Mother, and
when&mdash;I wanted to hate Jinny, but I'm sorry to say that I love
her. I don't suppose I'm more than six or seven years older than
she is, but I feel as if she were my daughter. She's fundamentally
a shy thing, isn't she? Look at her, trying to laugh at Roy's dirty
jokes."</p>

<p>"Well, Bradd will carry her through, on her other side.
He's&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Cass! Are you a competent husband for any girl as fine and
winning as Jinny?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. I hope so."</p>

<p>"You've got to be! For my sake, too. Cass, she's my understudy.
No, she's me; she represents me, she <i>is</i> me, in the only
love-affair I'll ever have. Are you gentle enough for her and
tolerant enough and imaginative enough and flexible enough?"</p>

<p>"What do you think?"</p>

<p>"I'm not sure you are. You're so methodical."</p>

<p>Then Cass was angry. "I'm sick and tired of this contemporary
belief that any man who likes to spend as much as one evening a
week home is too dull a breadwinner for any up-and-coming young
female who's had such a modern education in science and sociology
that she can turn on the radio all by herself! But I do love Jinny
to a point of desperation, and however much she may like
dancing-men and all these other wonder-boys that are too 'flexible'
to be 'methodical,' yet in the long run she'll prefer somebody
who's solid, like me or Bradd, and I don't intend to apologize even
to <i>her</i> because I do brush my teeth and pay my bills!"</p>

<p>"Cass, you do love her, don't you! I'm glad. Do love her. If you
ever for one minute wanted to love me or anything in me, then love
me now in her!"</p>

<p>Her intensity frightened him; in relief he looked along the
table at the placidity of Jinny. He was pleased to see how helpful
to her Bradd was being. Bradd was talking low and fast, and
smiling.</p>

<p>&mdash;Thank God, there's one friend I can trust to give her a
good time. Bradd is as young as Eino and as mellow as Steve
Blackstaff, and I wouldn't wonder if he understood women better
than some married men.<br>
<br></p>

<p>Jinny was so fortunate as to draw Bradd and the Penlosses for
bridge, after dinner; she seemed to have a good time, and Cass was
puzzled when she was silent to his query "Enjoy yourself?" during
the extensive five-block drive back home and when, in the hall, she
threw her silver-fox jacket at the indignant Cleo.</p>

<p>"Come sit on my knee," he said. Somehow that always seemed to
him a soothing thing to suggest at these times of sulkiness.</p>

<p>She obeyed, but her head against his shoulder was rigid as a
plaster model.</p>

<p>"What's trouble, baby?"</p>

<p>"<i>Nothing'S</i> the trouble! Good <i>heavens</i>, can't I be
quiet without your thinking that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, sweet, you can't. What's the charge?"</p>

<p>"You seemed to be having a gorgeous time with your old
girl-friend, that Grau woman."</p>

<p>She loved him enough to be jealous!</p>

<p>"I <i>was</i> having a gorgeous time with her. Do you know what
we were talking about?"</p>

<p>"Me, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Don't be so egocentric. But matter of fact, we were. She wanted
to hate you, but she's succumbed, like me. She loves you. I said
you were a hawk, but she says you're a <i>lark</i>, among all these
crows?'</p>

<p>"Well, now, that's what I call something like it!" She kissed
his bent forehead; kissed it again with "That second one is for
Chris. I always liked larks better than any other bird; the meadow
lark that makes you feel so fresh in early morning, and I want to
go to England when the war's over, just to hear the skylark. And
yet Chris does&mdash;"</p>

<p>She was tense again in his arms, and there was nothing funny,
nothing of the bad-little-girl in her grave complaint:</p>

<p>"But you and she were so intimate. You've known her so
long&mdash;you know so many things together that I never even heard
of. I felt so shut out. You two have jokes and memories&mdash;maybe
of all the romantic passes that you've made at her."</p>

<p>"Not so many and not serious. Why, Jin, you aren't jealous?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I am!"</p>

<p>"You, the crusader against jealousy?"</p>

<p>"I'm not a crusader against anything! I'm only jealous when
anybody takes <i>any</i> of you away from me. Jealous when I
realize, and God knows I try and forget it, that you've had so many
experiences with women that I don't even know about."</p>

<p>"Haven't you had experiences?"</p>

<p>"Not really. Eino kissed me very nicely one evening, if you want
to know. But when I think of Chris, and especially when I think of
<i>Blanche</i>, that hell-cat, that female heel&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, she wasn't."</p>

<p>"&mdash;then I get mad. You and your Blanche! Actually married
to her! I can just see it and hear it: dark rooms, and she on your
lap, too&mdash;"</p>

<p>She tried to bounce away, but not too violently, and he held
her.</p>

<p>"&mdash;and you two lying and laughing in the darkness and
breakfasting together in pajamas&mdash;oh, sometimes I get so
furious I could kill both of you, and sometimes it just makes me
disgusted and feeble. Cass Timberlane, you got to love me terribly,
to make me forget all that."</p>

<p>"Do you want me to?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I do!"</p>

<p>"Do you love me, Jin?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I do. Damn it!"</p>

<p>"How much?"</p>

<p>"Very much. Very very much."</p>

<p>She forgot her distress, and not till late, when she had refused
to return to her own room, on the ground that it was wolf-haunted,
and lay curled serenely in his vast bed, did he recall from his
criminal cases into what frightening shapes a resentment long
hidden can twist itself.</p>

<h2>Chapter 27</h2>

<p>He had heard it often enough from his sister Rose, but he had
never thoroughly understood that Jinny, with little occupation
beyond asking Mrs. Higbee what she wanted her to want, would become
idle, empty and bored.</p>

<p>Her chief employment was in war-work. With the others, she did
her Red Cross detail and the entertainment of transient soldiers,
but it took no initiative, not with such captains of enterprise as
Diantha Marl and Zeta Umbaugh directing her how to address
envelopes, how to make layettes for soldiers' wives. She worked
conscientiously, but the tasks did not take one-tenth of her time,
one-hundredth of her energy.</p>

<p>She had been elected to the Junior League, with its dances and
mild benevolences, but she did not feel greatly at home in that
self-constituted peerage of the Nice Women.</p>

<p>She read enough, but what to the factory draftsman had been
stolen joy was merely grim, as an all-day entertainment.</p>

<p>For a month it had been luxury, after having been a working girl
goaded by alarm clocks, to sleep till eleven and to breakfast on
Mrs. Higbee's gossip and Cleo's antics with the golden string. Yet,
before summer, Jinny was bored to the danger-point.</p>

<p>She hoped that when she had children, she would be fulfilled,
but there was no advice of their coming.</p>

<p>Now of all this Cass was more aware than Jinny knew, aware and
bothered. He had realized from divorce cases that boredom can be a
slimier serpent in Eden than cruelty or drunkenness, and he saw
that snake writhing.</p>

<p>What had Blanche done to keep busy? Why hadn't she
complained?</p>

<p>Oh, yes. He remembered now. She had.</p>

<p>And at that, Blanche had been nearer in age to Rose and the
Bozards and more companionable, and she had enjoyed impressing
Grand Republic by wearing backless dresses and being a great
hostess. But when she had not been on parade, she too had been
bored.</p>

<p>Cass wondered whether Jinny could, as Blanche decidedly could
not, be influenced to take an interest in the technicalities of his
work.</p>

<p>He gave her popular books about the law. He came home with
stories&mdash;even he did not think they came out very
excitingly&mdash;about what an old stickler Oliver Beehouse, chief
counsel for the Wargates, was about rules of evidence, what
battlers for justice Sweeney Fishberg and Nestor Purdwin were, and
how irritated Judge Blackstaff was when Judge Flaaten referred to
their new silk robes as their "overalls."</p>

<p>But he got no spark out of her till he told about the young
soldier who had been sent up for carnal knowledge, at which she
lighted up and warmly defended the young man without having
listened to anything but the more esoteric features of the case.
Cass discovered that she was as non-conformist in the judicial
system as in chess. Her theory of verdicts was humanitarian and
brief.</p>

<p>If a criminal was a nice-looking boy, you imposed the minimum
sentence and then suspended it and gave him five dollars to go out
and get another drink; and in civil litigation, the judge ought to
sneak out into the corridor with the foreman of the jury and tell
him to give judgment for all tenants, widows, and all persons over
seventy, and against all landlords, employers, corporations, and
bald-headed men who smoked cigars and called women "Sister."</p>

<p>"I don't think she'll ever be a rival of John Marshall," decided
Judge Timberlane.</p>

<p>It was in early March that he came home to find a girl dancing
with pride.</p>

<p>"Darling, know what's happened? Guess. You couldn't guess. Greg
Marl&mdash;what nerve!&mdash;he wants me to go back to work for
him. I will not! The idea! Maybe I will. Firing me&mdash;the best
cartoonist <i>he'll</i> ever get! Well, I guess I was sort of bad.
Maybe I'll be better now. But I was a pretty darn good cartoonist
then, too!"</p>

<p>"Whoa! What is all this?"</p>

<p>"Greg called up. Two of his reporters and his new cartoonist
have been drafted. He says he could just use a syndicated cartoon,
but he'd rather keep the local touch, and he thinks&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do you want to do this?"</p>

<p>"For a while, maybe. Yes, I think I do. Would you mind
terribly?"</p>

<p>"We'll talk about it at dinner. Let me think about it
first."</p>

<p>While he washed his hands, gargled, inspected the purity of his
collar, put on his smoking jacket, peeped at the war news, called
up about the coal, looked at the thermometer to see what time it
was and looked at his wrist-watch to see how cold, wrote a check
for the garbage-collector, glanced at the sports page, looked into
his current detective story to find out whether it was due back at
the public library, looked at the furnace, put on his slippers and
then, with a feeling that this was his evening to be dignified, put
on his shoes again, and then put on his slippers&mdash;through all
his exigent before-dinner duties, the Judge was voraciously
thinking about it first.</p>

<p>At dinner, Jinny spoke with more affection than
belligerence:</p>

<p>"I'm not so proud and stuffy that I care especially about
seeming independent of you, like Diantha Marl, but this is a shaky
world now, and any girl of my age may have to earn her living yet,
and she ought to be trained, and I've only started my training as a
draftsman. I ought to be really good."</p>

<p>"I agree."</p>

<p>"I wish I could be of some help to you in the law, but that
would take years, and I have made a start with drawing. Honestly,
it's all&mdash;well, anyway, it's partly because I do love you and
want you to respect me and not consider me just a kept woman. Can't
you see? I mean, work till God or whoever it is that's responsible
sends us some children. Couldn't I?"</p>

<p>"Dear child, you don't have to ask my permission!"</p>

<p>"But I wouldn't feel right&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm not your tyrant. If you want to do this enough, why, it's
decided. I'll admit I had hoped to have you waiting for me at the
end of the day, and all fresh, not a tired working woman, but I
know I have no right to demand that. So. When do you go to
work?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;yes&mdash;I know&mdash;but there is one thing. You
see, Greg wants me&mdash;and Hubbsy says I'd be fine at
it&mdash;and Greg will pay me more, but he wants me to do some
reporting, too, and that means the hours would be from noon till
eight o'clock in the evening&mdash;maybe later sometimes, but not
very often. How do you feel? I'm not quite sure."</p>

<p>He was a sunken man then, but he wanted to be polite.</p>

<p>"Look, Jin. If this were some critical war job, or if it were
going to lead to a blazing career for you, I'd be glad. I'd merely
be wondering how I could help. I know that more and more millions
of women will have to earn their livings now, and I'm all for
having every occupation&mdash;especially law and
medicine&mdash;open to them completely. But is it any part of this
theological doctrine of the economic independence of
women&mdash;this rare new doctrine that only goes back to the
Egyptian priestesses&mdash;that women <i>have</i> to have
independent jobs, even if it cracks up the men they love&mdash;or
at least the men that love them?"</p>

<p>"Don't look so utterly stricken! Of course I won't do it! Foul
idea anyway, out in the rain all evening when I've got you and Mrs.
H. and Cleo to come home to. Forget it!"</p>

<p>"But I don't want to forget it. You're right about the passing
of the fond, foolish Little Woman. But look. You yourself say you
need more training in art. You know this old fellow Bezique, that
has art classes at the Junior College? I hear he's quite
good&mdash;he wouldn't be here but for the war. Why don't you work
with him?"</p>

<p>"Maybe I will. Now stop looking so woe-begone. Honestly, I don't
insist on solving the entire feminist question right away!"</p>

<p>She rushed around the table to kiss his hair, which was
gratifying not only to Cass, but to the highly observant Cleo. She
was unusually pleased with him and with herself all evening, while
he tried to look generous but masterful, and underneath it worried
that, three months after their marriage, she could cheerfully have
left him for her own world of young workers, and had been kept from
it not by adhesion to him, but by the accident that she would have
to work after dark.</p>

<p>He realized that from his first sight of her on the
witness-stand, his zest in trying to win her had always been
underlaid by the fear of losing her. He realized that in the
civilization that he represented officially, if nine-tenths of the
people suffered from occasional hunger and constant insecurity, the
rest of the community, whom the nine-tenths labored to keep in
contentment, suffered from boredom and futility. His problem was
concerned not with one light-footed girl, but with all women
everywhere in an age that puzzled and frightened him.</p>

<p>And Jimmy&mdash;with enthusiasm she took up sketching and French
literature at the Junior College, in Alexander Hamilton High
School, and with more enthusiasm she dropped them, when she found
that most of the students in the adult classes were youngish
housewives who were more willing to fall in love with the teacher
than to study.</p>

<p>But this failure did not so much affect Jinny as her discovery
that she was a second Eleonora Duse.<br>
<br></p>

<p><b>An Assemblage of Husbands and Wives</b>
</p>

<p><i>Scott &amp; Juliet Zago</i>
</p>

<p>Scott Zago, president of the Northern Insurance Brokerage
Corporation of Grand Republic, Inc., suffered from nothing in life
except his diagnosis of himself as a humorous fellow.</p>

<p>He was a profound yet ingratiating insurance-man, a collector of
shotguns, a talented carver of duck-decoys, a powerful
dahlia-grower, a pipe-smoker, a dog-lover, and a faithful husband,
and he could quote accurately all the limericks about the Bishop of
Birmingham, but he would put on an expectant smile and make puns.
He telegraphed "Congratulations on the pappy event" to new fathers,
provided they were of an insurable social standing, and to lawyers
he said, "How's the great trial-liar today?"</p>

<p>He had a comic name for every acquaintance, and used it whenever
he saw them. Loudly. "Lydia Pinkham" was his name for Dr. Drover;
he shouted "How's Doc Pinkham this obsequious day?" even in the
hushed pomposity of the Federal Club; and he introduced him to male
strangers with, "Folks, I want you should meet Doc Pinkham. He'll
take care of any female complaints you got in stock today."</p>

<p>He found that Abbott Hubbs was born in Oklahoma, and he gurgled
invariably, "How's the oil wells today?" As he was never quite sure
whether Oklahoma was to be regarded as Western or Southern, he
added either, "Brethren, we will now absquatulate together and sing
'Dixie,'" or "Brethren, we will now absquatulate together and sing
'Home on the Range,'" according to his geographic mood.</p>

<p>But Scott Zago was magnificent as a husband.</p>

<p>Juliet and he made love rapturously and unwearyingly; they
giggled at each other's jokes, and whenever they tried to quarrel,
they broke down and laughed. They had two jolly children. They
called their fake half-timber cottage "The Dolls' House," and it
had a pool table and good beds and two-thirds of a set of The
Harvard Classics.</p>

<p>Their amorous delight was only increased by the fact that Scott
was fifty now and Juliet only thirty-five. She had been married to
him when she was twenty, but she was a chronic child-wife, and
would still be at seventy, if God should blessedly preserve her as
a proof of how unnecessary is intelligence to romance and fine
cookery.</p>

<p>She flapped her pretty little fat hands and beamed like a fat
round little baby and did a fantastic little toddling dance with
her little round feet, and simpered, "Honya, I dess tan't
understan' all de biggy, wisey gwowed-up talk that oo big mans is
saying, but 'ittle Juley can shake up a cuddly 'ittle Clover Club
while oo is doing it."</p>

<p>Her favorite endearment was this "Honya," and she ran to the
infantile in clothes; she wore ringlets, with piratical kerchiefs
flaunting over them, large pink hats, and dirndls and flat strapped
baby-shoes and chains hung with jingling silver charms. And she
poked people in the ribs and squealed at their wincing.</p>

<p>Juliet was not only infantile but cultured. Every month she took
from the library a volume on some branch of science like astrology,
New Thought, gland-therapy, Freud's translations from the original
four-letter words, or the hidden inner secrets of Tibet, and with
the touching zeal of the young savant, she quoted the first two
paragraphs of each book to all newcomers. Naturally, like Mrs.
Higbee across the way, she believed in numerology and palmistry,
but she had one superstition that Mrs. Higbee did not share: she
put perfume behind her ears. Also, she never listened to
information and let it go at that. She had to make a witty comment,
in the belief that she was easing the social way for large and
surly professors of biophysics or Burmese history.</p>

<p>Most men knew instinctively that the way to shut up Juliet was
to kiss her. For so plump a girl, she did get more incidental
kissing from entirely tangential gentlemen! They were deceived,
however, if they thought they were going farther.</p>

<p>After parties, she reported to Scott on the assorted kisses she
had received during the evening, and he tried, under her direction,
to imitate the several categories, as: the butterfly kiss, the
solid brother-in-law, the allergic-to-lipstick, the short
interrogative, the long interrogative, and the vampire-minatory,
meant for ravishing. They bounced around in bed and laughed a good
deal during these imitations, and ended up in an innocent frenzy
which would have astonished serious citizens like Judge Timberlane,
who thought the Zagos were fools, or sentimentalists like Young
Mrs. Timberlane, who thought they were triflers.</p>

<p>The Zagos came near to justifying all such anachronisms as
Insurance, cocktails, and houses with shingles imitating
thatch.</p>

<h2>Chapter 28</h2>

<p>From a camp in South Carolina, Eino Roskinen wrote to Jinny,
"I'm a corporal, I shall be a sergeant, I'll never be a comm.
officer, I ask too many flip questions. Now you are married and a
woman of leisure, why don't you finally go out for the Lit Theater,
you have looks and spirit, tho I doubt whether you have enough
inner discipline to take direction, why not try? Furioso the
Finn."</p>

<p>She read it aloud to Cass, and said with marked doubt, "What do
you think?"</p>

<p>"Not bad. I believe you'd be good at dramatics, and you'd have a
lot of fun. The Masquers have had a good reputation, more than ten
years now. I couldn't ever imagine myself getting up there before a
lot of people and pretending I was a king or a butler&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You do every day. On the bench."</p>

<p>"Maybe. Anyway, I'd be delighted."</p>

<p>"I wonder when the next try-out is. I wonder what the play will
be."</p>

<p>"The play is Skylark, by Samson Raphaelson; it's the last play
of the season; the reading will be at Della Lent's next Thursday
evening, at eight-fifteen."</p>

<p>"How come you always know everything?"</p>

<p>"Why, I read the papers!"<br>
<br></p>

<p>Rice and Patty Helix were small and active and rather untidy.
They were the paid semi-professional managers of the Masquers:
directors, scene-designers, ticket-peddlers, borrowers of stage
furniture. They were devoutly married, and they were either older
than they looked, or more wrinkled than their age. They talked,
rapidly and enthusiastically, about "Gene" O'Neill, moonlight-blue
lights, and tormentors, and they could make a wind-machine out of
an old bicycle, a marble Venus out of a Quaker Oats box.</p>

<p>They had acted professionally, but no one seemed to know just
when or where; they said that they had given it up because it was
so hard to get engagements together; and before they had found a
career in the little theaters, they had tried chicken-farming and
clairvoyance and being lecture agents in Texas. Late at night, they
were seen running hand in hand. The Boone Havocks received them as
somewhere between schoolteachers and bartenders.</p>

<p>But at best they were the upper servants of Della Wargate Lent,
who supported the Masquers.</p>

<p>The plays were rehearsed at the various houses of the cast and
finally presented in the high-school auditorium, but the try-outs
were held at Della's abode, which was by no means the largest house
in Grand Republic but had the largest drawing-room, all filled with
gilt pianos and majolica.</p>

<p>For casting during war-time the Helixes had enough women among
whom to choose, but they had to drag in young men from shops and
factories and offices. There were present for the reading of
Skylark only eleven men from whom to pick the six male characters
of the play, and one of these was cross-eyed though spirited, but
for the four women characters there were twenty-seven candidates,
ranging from fourteen and sulky to sixty-three and still
artistic.</p>

<p>All twenty-seven wanted to play Mrs. Kenyon, the lead.</p>

<p>Cass told himself that Jinny stood out among the others as the
loveliest yet the most efficient. It was not the fantastic or the
playful or the flirtatious Jinny who was here tonight, but a
business-like young woman in a snuff-colored suit, a crisp scarf, a
small brown hat.</p>

<p>They all tried it, but only two were chosen for a second reading
of the part of Mrs. Kenyon: Jinny and Letty Vogel, wife of the
county agricultural agent. Mrs. Vogel was three or four years older
than Jinny, a thin figure in almost-shabby black, a thin, pale,
anxious face with eyes too large.</p>

<p>&mdash;That poor Vogel girl. Seems to have a fancy for the
theater, but not a chance against Jinny&mdash;all fire and
ivory.</p>

<p>They tried again, and Jinny's reading was like crystal, her
voice warm, every syllable clear&mdash;and all syllables exactly
alike. Lefty Vogel seemed tired and her voice was slightly shaky,
but as she read she was not Mrs. Vogel at all but the character in
the play: wilful, gay, a little cheap and utterly tragic, a
wisecracking angel.</p>

<p>&mdash;Now, now, now! This is awful! Mrs. Vogel is superb and
poor Jinny, she can't act at all! She reads like a schoolgirl.</p>

<p>And so Cass loved her, passionately and protectively, because
she could not act.</p>

<p>Della Lent and the Helixes whispered together, and Rice Helix
announced:</p>

<p>"Folks, both these final readings were simply swell, and we all
know what a fine, hard-working actress Letty has always shown
herself to be in a number of plays, but for this particular society
part, we feel that Mrs. Timberlane is not only the best, but golly,
what a high-class best, and we honest to God believe that with the
careful direction we intend to give her, she will put it all over
the original performance that Gertrude Lawrence gave on Broadway.
Welcome to our midst, Jinny; you sure are a great addition to the
local arts. And now, folks, before we bust up, let's put back the
chairs in order that Mrs. Lent has been so generous and, to not
intentionally make a pun, has lent us for our little try-out, and I
sure am real proud of the showing that <i>all</i> you folks have
made this evening, not a bad egg in the basket, as the fellow says,
and don't be discouraged, if at first you don't succeed, try, try
again, and don't forget, put back your own chair where it was, we
thank you."</p>

<p>The just Judge was staring, wanting to protest, wanting Jinny to
protest, and loving her passionately because she did not know how
bad an actress she was.<br>
<br></p>

<p>The first rehearsal of Skylark was held in the Cyclopean
basement of Cass's Bergheim, with cordwood and ash-cans and
shotgun-shell boxes for furniture. The first half of it, Cass did
not see, and he was regretful, as he had already forgotten that the
flowering of Jinny's dramatic genius might not be so showy an
exhibit. But he had to go off to address a dinner of the local
Junior Chamber of Commerce: "Eat at six, inspiration at
seven-fifteen, home at eight-thirty, all come, special treat this
time, Hizzoner Cass Timberlane on 'The Cultural and Architectural
Future of Our City.'"</p>

<p>As a judge, Cass was expected to know everything, and as a
knower of everything, he was expected to hold forth about it
publicly, and as a public forth-holder, he was expected to be a
medicinal but tasty digestive tablet after the chicken croquettes
and brick ice cream. Oratory is the dearest treasure of the
American male as alimony is of the American female.</p>

<p>Tonight, Cass was prophetic. He said that some time the City
Planning Commission might really have power, and firmly discourage
the citizens of Grand Republic in their constant ambition to erect
a two-story red-brick bowling-alley, with offices for
chiropractors, between a ten-story limestone bank and the City
Hall. The Junior Chamber of Commerce, composed of men under
thirty-six who expected some day to belong to the Senior C. of C.
and have public esteem, were slightly shocked by Judge Timberlane's
communism. They whispered together that "He oughtn't to pull such
impractical and uncommercial ideas on a forward-looking group that
are expected to mold the ideals for the new age of Business and the
American Way of Life."</p>

<p>But his adjectives, his grammar, and the authority in Cass's
voice made them forgive him, and at the end they did that mystic
rite, that flapping together of portions of their anatomies, like
locusts scraping their wing-cases, which is known as applause, and
six of them invited him out for a drink.</p>

<p>The Judge thought that these young husbands were strangely
desirous of staying away from their wives, on their rare evening
out, and after listening to a talking-dog story, he got away from
them and hastened home for the end of the rehearsal.</p>

<p>&mdash;Keen to see her work. Of <i>course</i> Jinny is better
than Letty Vogel. Mrs. Vogel is too pretentious and arty. I much
prefer to have Jinny keep her voice clear and melodious, and not
crack it with all sorts of attempts to be emotional. She'll be
wonderful.</p>

<p>&mdash;Well, anyway, she'll be all right&mdash;as good as any of
'em.</p>

<p>&mdash;She could be a great actress or a great anything, if she
put her mind to it. Her mind is so flexible.</p>

<p>&mdash;Love to think of her hair&mdash;the way when you see it
from behind, it's scarcely hair at all but some finer fabric. It's
dark and sleek at the top, but it runs down into waves that you
want to follow with your hand.</p>

<p>&mdash;So much!<br>
<br></p>

<p>The author of Skylark, who presumably thought that he had
written high comedy, would have been astonished to learn that, as
enacted by Fred Nimbus, it was a Hollywood demonstration of sultry
tropic passions.</p>

<p>Cass came down the dark stairs to his basement and stood to
watch Fred trying out "business" with Jinny. He thought that this
business of manhandling Jinny was altogether too businesslike. He
had no initiation into theatricals nor into midnight
studio-parties; he resented her being mauled.</p>

<p>Fred was, under the directive eye of Mr. Helix but apparently
not needing that expert encouragement, slowly kissing Jinny, her
head back, sidewise and helpless; kissing her long and closely, and
letting his tight-pressing hand slip from her shoulder to her
breast.</p>

<p>Then Cass came into the lighted basement all in one piece, and
Cass spoke.</p>

<p>"Nimbus! You may quit that now!"</p>

<p>Nimbus quit.</p>

<p>"Helix, it is not necessary for this fellow to act like a thug
in a bawdy-house in order to rehearse a play."</p>

<p>Poor Rice Helix trembled. "Are you trying to bully me?"</p>

<p>"Of course! But I think that's all the outburst I'll need. Go on
with the rehearsal now, and you be a good boy, Nimbus. Good night,
everybody. I'm going upstairs and read the Book of Mormon. Isn't it
curious now that I've never read the Book of Mormon? Good
night."</p>

<p>And he did read it. He was not much afraid of what Jinny would
be coming up to say&mdash;not more afraid than of the black plague,
or indictment for malfeasance.</p>

<p>When she did come, after the rehearsal, and started with the
inevitable, "Well, of all the&mdash;" he plunged.</p>

<p>"Dry up, Jinny. I know the line. Ridiculously jealous
husband&mdash; crass outsider interfering with the arts. Will you
answer this: Fred had been pawing you pretty extensively before I
came, hadn't he? Huh? Hadn't he?"</p>

<p>She half giggled. "He was kind of exploratory."</p>

<p>"And I'm not going to have my wife declared a general area for
exploration, with dog-teams and native bearers. If you'd slapped
Fred, as you should have, I wouldn't have had to make a spectacle
of myself. Remember that, the next time you go and get modern and
courageous on me, will you?"</p>

<p>She tried her best, with:</p>

<p>"You must admit you were rather middle-class and reactionary
and&mdash; Shouting and bullying and carrying on that way, when if
you'd been a man of the world, or believed in the ability of the
modern woman to take care of herself, you'd just of tapped Fred
lightly on the shoulder and said gaily, 'Ease it up, ole boy.' You
know. Something like that. Something&mdash;uh&mdash;suave."</p>

<p>He laughed at her, and she looked unconvinced of her own
advice.</p>

<p>"Jinny! I know I was noisy, but both of you were asking for it.
You didn't think he was measuring you for a raincoat, did you?
Raincoats don't fit that tight. So! Kiss me."</p>

<p>She grumbled only a little, and she kissed him with surprising
devotion.</p>

<p>But he knew that it would not last. He had succeeded for a few
minutes in being masterful, melodramatic, insulting, and all the
other things that a sedentary professional man, married to so
attractive and curiosity-ridden a girl as Jinny Marshland, ought to
be, but he was not easy in the role.</p>

<h2>Chapter 29</h2>

<p>He was not unduly intrusive on the other rehearsals, but merely
looked on a moment when he called to drive her home. He was pleased
to see how patiently Jinny was working; her part letter-perfect
after two weeks, taking direction, merely arguing a little with
Rice Helix when he insisted that a Perfect Lady expressed her
emotions by showing all her teeth and wriggling her fingers as
though a bug was crawling over them. He was even more pleased that
she was seeing new friends here: Letty Vogel&mdash;who, as she
could not play the lead, earnestly built the scenery, Bernice
Claywheel, wife of the Superintendent of Schools, Dick and Francia
Wolke, the young rabbi, Ned Sarouk, and his wife Nelly, and Jay
Laverick, the flour-miller, the only member of the Federal Club
besides Frank Brightwing who recognized the Masquers.</p>

<p>Cass was puzzled by Fred Nimbus's intentions. Now, whenever it
was Fred's appalling duty to embrace Jinny, he did so lightly, with
tapping fingers. But a sour thought occurred to Cass: that Fred
might be taking advantage of that most sound and ancient technique
of the child&mdash;knowing that the safest time to steal the jam is
when the family is ashamed of itself for having yelled at it for
having stolen the jam. It had never quite come to Judge Timberlane
that there are men outside jail who make it a careful and
well-funded business to seduce all the pretty women in sight, and
that against their expert business-methods, an innocent householder
is helpless.</p>

<p>"Oh, quit being so ingeniously jealous and let the girl have a
good time," the ardent husband rebuked himself.</p>

<p>He noticed then that it was not the pulpy Nimbus but the gallant
Mr. Jay Laverick with whom Jinny laughed in corners and, between
scenes, danced the rhumba.</p>

<p>Jay Laverick was the town drunk, the town clown, the town
tragedy. He was a widower of forty, and he had inherited the
Laverick Flour Mills. He was always polite when he was drunk, but
unfortunately he was almost always drunk when he was polite. No
dance at the Heather Country Club was canonical without the
presence of Jay Laverick, emitting the rebel yell and saying to
some aged (and delighted) matron, "Madame, does my reason totter on
her throne, or are you actually Queen Elizabeth the First?" When
people said, as people immensely did say, "Poor Jay is drinking
himself to death," it was not irritably but with affection.</p>

<p>In person he was not the round and beloved comic Irishman but
the sallow and villainous baronet, with a thin dark face and a long
black mustache. It was to be credited to his inherited Irish
constitution that, against the normal rule, excess of alcohol had
not impaired his powers of love-making.</p>

<p>He was the best flour-salesman north of Minneapolis, and usually
sober in the office.</p>

<p>Not till the rehearsals had Jay and Jinny met, except in crowds.
She liked his bitter capering, his tragic flourishes, his lightly
touching hands, professional touch of the surgeon, the pianist, the
healing saint, or the satyr.</p>

<p>Cass was uncomfortable again&mdash;and tired of it.</p>

<p>He told himself: here is this poor girl, business-like in
sweater and slacks, sexless as a nurse, working hard to produce
something beautiful in a blacked-out world. No gauds and gimcracks;
just a sweater and gray manly trousers. But&mdash;Did Jinny know
how fetching, how conspicuously womanly, she was in a tight
sweater?</p>

<p>&mdash;Of course she knows it! All women know things like that.
Their capital is modesty, but how they do squander it.</p>

<p>&mdash;Of course she never even thinks of such a thing, you
Pharisee. You love her, don't you? Well, then! How can you insult
her with such suspicions?</p>

<p>&mdash;Oh, nuts! Whoever said there wasn't a lot of wanton in
every good woman?</p>

<p>&mdash;Well, I don't like your using the word "wanton" and
thinking evil of&mdash;</p>

<p>&mdash;Look here! The monarch who sniffed "Honi soit qui mal y
pense" was not of a notably moral character. There's nothing
shameful about suspecting that a girl is not displeased when she
knows that she's stirring up a few normal biological reactions by
all her beauties lily-white. You wouldn't want her to be unworldly
to a point of imbecility, would you?</p>

<p>&mdash;Sure! I wouldn't mind a bit! Friend, my worship of her
<i>is</i> unworldly, it has a little of the divine; to me, she is
all womanhood, out of every time and place.</p>

<p>&mdash;Yes, yes. As you say. But I do wish she wouldn't so
perpetually get herself ambushed by Nimbus and Jay. Why can't she
talk to a really nice fellow, like Frank Brightwing?</p>

<p>Though Cass saw less of Frank Brightwing than of Roy Drover or
Bradd Criley, there was no one in Grand Republic whom he more
warmly liked. At thirty-eight, Frank was what is known as a
successful real-estate man; he dealt not in harp-playing and the
design of angels' pinions, as was his nature and as his name
quaintly hinted, but in Lot 13, Block 7; in 2-c garg., r.w., h
&amp; c; in abutments and amortizations and easements. He had a
plush wife and three medium-grade children, but his excitement was
in the Masquers, and if a play ran for two weeks, then for twelve
nights he went on believing that the hero was as courageous and the
heroine as voluptuous and the comic maid as funny as they said they
were.</p>

<p>Being the worst of actors, as is likely with such a worshiper of
acting, Frank had to be ticket-seller, stage-carpenter, and
assistant electrician, and he was content with life when they let
him hold the book at rehearsals.</p>

<p>Being, remarkably, also the worst of critics, he believed and he
told Cass that they were lucky to have Jinny playing Mrs. Kenyon
instead of Letty Vogel.</p>

<p>"But I thought Mrs. Vogel showed a lot of talent."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, Cass. You laymen don't understand these technical
problems. Letty is what we in the theatrical world call 'fuzzy,'
while Jinny is sure of herself&mdash;a real type. Oh, she's out of
this world, Cass."<br>
<br></p>

<p>Over morning coffee, Cass said cheerfully, "Well, Jinny, I guess
our friend Nimbus has laid off you."</p>

<p>"Oh, absolutely. Sweet Freddy, he's such an obvious lug that he
never gets far."</p>

<p>"You kind of liked him."</p>

<p>"Sure I did. I like all rats. They usually know how to kid like
nobody's business, and they have a line. It's their job."</p>

<p>In English, she meant, "Certainly. I like all scoundrels. They
are full of amiable banter." Her normal use of the swing-age argot
had been increased by association with the violently artistic
Masquers, but Judge Timberlane understood much of her dialect, and
love enlightened where understanding staggered, and increasingly he
used the dialect himself.</p>

<p>"Anyway, I wouldn't ever be half so jealous of Nimbus as of Jay
Laverick. I imagine you women find him a dashingly tragic
figure."</p>

<p>"I'll say! And how! And has he fallen for me!"</p>

<p>"Don't take it too seriously. Jay is a decent fellow with men,
but his record of falling for every female from six to ninety-six
is rather extensive."</p>

<p>"Now don't go and tell me you're going to be really jealous even
of your old friend Jay!"</p>

<p>"How could I be? Ho, ho!"</p>

<p>"Sweetie pie, that's the falsest-sounding stage-laugh I ever
heard. Now quit it!"</p>

<p>&mdash;I told you so! What did you ever bring it up for? You
knew just how far you'd get, didn't you?</p>

<p>&mdash;I couldn't help it.<br>
<br></p>

<p>Rice and Patty Helix knew their strange art of coaxing people to
give up being themselves and become someone else, not so pleasant.
The play, when it was presented at the high-school auditorium,
actually was a play and not an amateur reading. Cass found himself
for moments believing that Jinny was this flashing wife of an
acrobatic advertising man and not his own simple girl.</p>

<p>At the opening-night party afterward, at Della Lent's, Cass
noted the following expert dramatic criticisms:</p>

<p>Bradd Criley, lawyer: "Honest, boy, she was wonderful. Even I
didn't know there was so much fire in her."</p>

<p>Frank Brightwing, real estate &amp; loans: "She was ten times
better than Gertrude Lawrence in the role. I never saw Miss
Lawrence in it, but I know."</p>

<p>Mrs. Gerald Lent, husband-supporter: "She wasn't bad at all,
Cass. But was that Nimbus lousy! <i>and</i> Jay!"</p>

<p>Mrs. John William Prutt, spiritual, social and domestic adviser
in banking: "Mr. Prutt and I thought she was very fine, Judge. I do
hope her playacting and the practising don't interfere with her
war-work and the home."</p>

<p>Roy Drover, physician &amp; surgeon: "It wasn't a bad show, and
I thought Jinny was as good as any of 'em."</p>

<p>Norton Trock, banker: "Why, Cass, she was simply too, too
divine. She was all right."</p>

<p>Fred Nimbus, radio artist: "Honestly, Judge, I never could of
put it over like I did if it hadn't been for Mrs. Timberlane's
loyal support."<br>
<br></p>

<p>Jay Laverick kept sober through the rehearsals, the six
performances of the play, and Della's first-night party. He did not
break down and become natural man till the party at the end of the
run, a gaudy one at Madge Dedrick's. Champagne. Though not
imported. But that night he whooped and held Jinny's hands and
fulsomely kissed her.</p>

<p>Cass was near enough to hear her say "You quit that!" in a
manner so vicious that Jay released her. She walked over to Cass
and groaned, "Sweet darling, if you ever catch me seeming to
encourage any man again, you beat me."</p>

<p>"I don't think I'll need to."</p>

<p>She was of a forgiving nature, for before the party was over,
she was dancing with Jay, and painlessly.</p>

<p>Bradd Criley muttered to Cass, "For a nice fella, Jay can be
such a jackass. It takes Jinny to handle him. What a girl!"</p>

<p>When Cass and Jinny came home at three, she kissed him boldly.
He was glad that, no matter how other men might flatter her, it was
to him that she turned for true affection.</p>

<p>At dawn, he heard Cleo crying. When he left the sleeping Jinny
and went down to the little cat, she shivered and nestled against
him and seemed afraid.<br>
<br></p>

<p>The Banner's strictly favorable review of Skylark, written by
Pandora Avondene, admitted that each actor was either Compelling,
Professional, Brilliant, or at least Satisfying. A second account
in the paper on Sunday reviewed the play as a Social Event and,
whether by accident or through the malice of Abbott Hubbs, wound up
with a gasping announcement.</p>

<p>It revealed that Mr. Fred Nimbus, who had shown such Sterling
Qualities in Skylark, and who had been writing and playing in a
series of radio stories about the Marines, over Station
<i>kich</i>, which had been so powerful that he was credited with
having gained many recruits, now felt that he did not desire to
wait and be drafted, and he was going to enlist in the Marines
himself.</p>

<p>The town cheered. But Mr. Fred Nimbus did not cheer. This was
all news to him.</p>

<p>He called up Cass, along with other local rulers, and cried that
he was being railroaded into the service; that Cass must do
something about it; that while he was zealous to go as soon as his
number came up, he had first to settle his affairs. He did not
exactly have a mother to support, but he did have a maiden
aunt.</p>

<p>"They say that if I don't go in voluntarily, the Marines will
force me to. That's outrageous and undemocratic!" whimpered
Fred.</p>

<p>"Nonsense. Who says they will?" growled Cass.</p>

<p>"Oh, everybody does."</p>

<p>In a way, everybody did. There was very little masculine
tenderness in town for Mr. Nimbus. But a number of maidens who had
thrilled to Fred's manly crooning of his own poetic prose came to
serenade him at his boarding-house. There was no balcony for Fred
to come out on, like Juliet or a young Mussolini, but he mounted a
folding stepladder-chair on the front stoop, and addressed
them:</p>

<p>"Dear girls, you move me more than I can attempt to say. It is
to defend the virtue and happiness of girls like you that I want to
enlist, and I have arranged to do so tomorrow morning, Room 307,
the County Court House, and any of you who care to come, be sure
and be there before ten. I don't know why you should care for my
poor autograph, but if you'll bring your little books, I'll be glad
to do what I can. I am so happy that at last I have been able to
arrange my affairs, and I can now rush where the fighting is
thickest."</p>

<p>Next morning one hundred and sixteen females, mostly under
nineteen, filled the corridor and cheered and wept when Fred
appeared at the door of Room 307, looking scared, with a marine
sergeant, looking derisive.</p>

<p>He later denied the sergeant's canard that he had applied for
office work at Marine Headquarters.</p>

<p>Jinny came giggling in to inform Cass that Fred had telephoned
wanting to say good-bye to her privately.</p>

<p>"I'm going to stay right with you all the time he's here! I
won't have him bothering you!"</p>

<p>"Don't worry, darling. He's not coming. I told him to go jump in
the lake," said Jinny, in a refined manner.<br>
<br></p>

<p><b>An Assemblage of Husbands and Wives</b>
</p>

<p><i>Benjamin &amp; Petal Hearth</i>
</p>

<p>As a member of that earnest sect, the Cross and Crown
Covenanters, Benjamin Hearth had read numerous tracts about wives
with quarter-loaves and half-candles and starving children who
waited shivering at home for drunken husbands, usually coachmen;
helpful tracts written in England in 1880 and still circulated in
forward-looking America in the 1940's. Benjamin loved to read and
to distribute such tracts, and it never occurred to him that in
these liberal days, the sexes of the drunks could be switched.</p>

<p>He was the junior partner in Hearth &amp; Hearth, the Friendly
Morticians, once doing the finest and most sympathetic
undertaking-business in Grand Republic but of late eclipsed by that
less artistic outfit, the Larson Funeral Home and Byzantine
Interdenominational Chapel with the Revolving Cross. He was fat,
and fond of beer and sauerkraut, which afterward he repented, in
fits of indigestion and remembered piety.</p>

<p>His wife, Petal, was a slight, spectacled, prim-looking woman.
She was also a dipsomaniac, a drunk and a dirty drunk, but to the
end Benjamin never acknowledged this.</p>

<p>He loved her and she him. Each orgy he accepted as something
that had never occurred before and certainly never could occur
again, and, after hearing her regrets and wails and audible
hair-tearing, he felt himself a sneak to have believed that it had
really occurred this time. Probably her stomach. Or her laudable
grief over the sickness of the second child of Cousin Mary, who
lived in Indiana.</p>

<p>Benjamin was, in a genteel and Covenanter way, convivial; he
loved society dinners at six o'clock, with pickled peaches, and
grace said, and a game of mahjong afterwards&mdash;but never the
immoral cards, which lead to atheism and vice. When Petal married
him&mdash;she had been substitute telephone girl for the legal firm
of Beehouse, Criley and Anderson, and later a clerk in the linen
department of Tarr's Emporium&mdash;she had stepped into a degree
of social prestige beyond her experience.</p>

<p>She had always liked hot gin better than Benjamin could have
guessed, but economy and the necessity of working all day had
prevented her specializing in it. All of Benjamin's snobbish
friends&mdash;most of them had detached houses, and one was a
professional man, Orlo Vay the optician&mdash;said that Petal was
quite the lady, with an inspiration in trimming hats.</p>

<p>They did not know her peculiar gift and betrayal: when she was
drunk, she could still sound sober on the telephone.</p>

<p>Not much was suspected till, a couple of years after her
marriage, within one fortnight she had begged off from three
different suppers to which Benjamin and she had been invited, and
one that they were giving, always on the grounds that "Some close
relatives of mine have just arrived unexpectedly from Indiana, this
afternoon."</p>

<p>Her circle felt that that was too many Indiana relatives too
unexpectedly. George Hame, the court attache, an enterprising and
agnostic fellow, went creeping up to the Hearth nest after one of
these disconcerting refusals and, peeping under a curtain, saw
Petal not entertaining anybody at all, from Indiana or elsewhere,
but flopped on a couch, apparently snoring, while Benjamin sat by
in distress, smoothing his chin.</p>

<p>George reported that to him it looked as though she had "passed
out cold."</p>

<p>Benjamin knew that she had had a drink, "for a bad cold or maybe
it's intestinal flu," but in a blindness of prospering love he had
been fooled by the sobriety with which she had told him that she
had not felt well enough to go out, and had invented the Indiana
kin to save people's feelings.</p>

<p>He was baffled by the famine of social invitations which now set
in.</p>

<p>Petal had enough of the sot's admirable caution to arrange her
best escapes at times when Benjamin was off on funeral duty. But
with the splendid new friends whom she met in bar-rooms, now that
she had the leisure and the funds, she became less cautious and
more thirsty. Once, when she had got home safely from a
cocktail-joint in time to get Benjamin's supper and found a note
saying that he would be on duty out on a farm all evening, she felt
unusually free and happy. She laughed and put on a negligee. She
took out her private gin bottle, finished the gin, hid the bottle
again, felt dizzy, again found the bottle, and was amazed that it
was empty.</p>

<p>In fluttering negligee, she ran out of the house, across the
street through traffic, past two red lights, and into a liquor
store.</p>

<p>On her way home, with bottle, a policeman stopped her. He hinted
that he thought she might have escaped from an asylum, and such was
the shock to her that she screamed and sat on the curb, weeping. A
young man who had been following her came up to say suavely, "It's
my sister, Officer. She's had a kind of delirious fever. I'll get
her home."</p>

<p>The crowd laughed at the spectacle of the drunken woman being
half carried by the young man, while she wept all over him in
gratitude. He did get her into her house, into bed. What could she
do then in gratitude but throw her arms about him and kiss him?</p>

<p>The patient Benjamin, at his labors in a windy farm-house, knew
nothing of this, ever.</p>

<p>His first enlightenment was later, when he came home from what
he felt to have been a "real beautiful funeral," and found water
soaking through the dining-room ceiling. Above, in the bathtub,
naked and entirely drunk, singing "The Red Light Rag," was his
Petal.</p>

<p>The severest thing he said to her afterward was "Dearie, promise
me you won't let anybody tempt you to take a drink again. You're
such an unsuspicious little silly, sweetheart, that you don't
realize what this horrid liquor can do. Promise Benny you'll never
touch it again, dearie."</p>

<p>"Oh, I promise, I promise&mdash;oh, God, my head!" sobbed the
damp Petal.</p>

<p>In sobriety, Petal was a woman most ladylike in her syntax, one
who knew that you must never call perspiration sweat and that to
refer to a pregnancy by any verbal gesture less refined than "the
coming happy event" was a coarse and whorish thing, not to be
permitted in Evangelical circles. Yet a week after the bathtub,
when George Hame had with some curiosity invited them in for
chicken a la king, she slipped out to the garage with George, had
five amazingly quick drinks, and went back to turn upon Benjamin
and pronounce in a cool, amiable, very sober and interested voice,
"Jesus, what a fat &mdash;&mdash; you are. The trouble with you is,
your mother took in washing, and the way the cop on the beat used
to pay her for it was&mdash;So don't ever try and pull any of your
Sunday-school stuff on me."</p>

<p>Benjamin was very sorry when she spoke thus. He explained to
everybody that she didn't mean it at all. She was just nervous.</p>

<p>He knew now. Yet such was his love for this woman, who was so
refined and superior, that he would not permit himself to know what
he knew.</p>

<p>Once it was clear that he understood, she became more careless,
and he tended her like a nurse in a private mad house. He cleaned
the vomit from her shoes, he changed the sheets when she had fouled
their bed, and when she struck him, though he was a massive man, he
wailed, "Oh, don't do that, dearie! I didn't mean to make you
cross."</p>

<p>She had developed this new and fascinating trait of hitting
people, hitting them quietly and very painfully. She did it once at
their pastor's house, and that ended any possible resurrection of
the Hearths' social career.</p>

<p>She blamed Benjamin; she said that people could not endure his
vulgar belching. On that theme she shouted for an hour. When he
tried to stop her, she shut herself in the locked guest-room, where
she had stored half a case of gin. Sometimes she screamed at him
through the door, sometimes out of the window at awed neighborhood
children.</p>

<p>Benjamin took to staying away from the business, to guard her.
They became hermits, the lonelier in sitting together spying on
each other. He knew that she was thinking how she could kill
him.</p>

<p>His older brother, Robert, head of the firm, told him that he
would have to have Petal locked up in an institution, or quit the
business.</p>

<p>He quit.</p>

<p>He went to work in the Wargate plant, on war materials,
satisfied with the job of running a band-saw all day, except when
he thought of Petal's misfortunes. People did not understand
her.</p>

<p>For two days, at home, she could get no liquor at all, because
he had given her no money and the stores did not trust her. Then
she found an old bachelor who was amenable.</p>

<p>When she set fire to their house, Benjamin did have to send her
to a private sanitarium. He lives now in a hall-room and cooks his
own meals on a kerosene stove, because it takes most of what he
earns to keep her in the sanitarium. In his room there is but one
ornament: the bridal picture of Petal, in white satin, unstained
and lovely. Benjamin sits and looks at the picture or at a
newspaper all evening.</p>

<p>The landlady lends him the newspaper. He feels that he cannot
afford to buy one.</p>

<p>He says that when his dear wife recovers from her mental shock,
which she sustained upon the death of a beloved relative, they are
going out into the country to rent a farm and grow flowers.
Benjamin particularly loves all flowers that look like white satin,
lovely and unstained.</p>

<h2>Chapter 30</h2>

<p>There was as yet no wartime gasoline rationing in the
Middle-west, and they had driven, for the beginning of their summer
vacation, north to Ely and the deep woods of the Arrowhead canoe
country, up to Grand Portage, which in the 1790's was the castle of
the French and British fur traders. You can still see the ghosts of
the voyageurs, in capotes and sashes, toting their canoes at
twilight.</p>

<p>They drove back along the vast bright palisades of the North
Shore of Lake Superior to Grand Marais, and up the Gunflint Trail
to a dark lake curtained with pines, where they paddled under a
great sunset that made their voices cleave together in fear of
loneliness, beneath that threatening majesty.</p>

<p>They sat now in their car on the Skyline Boulevard, looking far
down on the city of Duluth and the blue-and-silver vastness of Lake
Superior, that blazing shield of inland ocean. Across this narrowed
end of the lake, the Wisconsin shore rose into hills, and on the
Minnesota side, to the eastward, the cliffs behind the smooth
uplands of the Hollister Hills were cut by ravines meant for a
western Rip van Winkle. The air was thinner and more resolute than
the earthy odor of their own inland cornfields and valley
thickets.</p>

<p>Jinny mused, "It's so exciting and lovely, Duluth, between hills
and the sea. I've loved the whole trip&mdash;Grand Marais&mdash;the
Riviera towns must lie against the hills like that. And you've been
so much fun, such a whale of a paddler and fly-caster. I'm much
obliged to you, sir."</p>

<p>"Best time since our honeymoon, I think. Look at that ship down
there, headed east."</p>

<p>An ore boat, huge as a liner, was hull-down on the milk-white
eastern horizon; it flickered in straying sun and was presently out
of sight, all but its trail of smoke.</p>

<p>Cass mused, "Tomorrow it will be at the Soo. I always think
there's a kind of sadness in the passing of ships that we might
have taken to ports with domes and towers and bazaars&mdash;and
Asian birds. But if I were here alone in Duluth, I'd be imagining
that the steamer was sailing off with <i>you</i>, at sunset, and I
not on it."</p>

<p>"Look! Here I am. I'm not on it!"</p>

<p>"I'm glad."</p>

<p>Silver flaws shivered across the lake, and now another great red
ore ship, westward-bound, was coming into sight, with its high
pilot's deck and its coal-filled belly for the furnaces of
Minneapolis and the Dakotas. Their pensiveness was gone in more
prosaic cheerfulness.</p>

<p>"What a lot of coal there must be in that hold for somebody to
shovel," considered Cass.</p>

<p>"Look, pie. Let's move to Duluth. More fun than Grand
Republic."</p>

<p>"Nope. It's too large. Over a hundred thousand people. That's
terrible&mdash;bad as Chicago or London, almost. Even Grand
Republic is too big. I like a place where you can know people."</p>

<p>"And I like a place where there are some people you can
know!"</p>

<p>"Now, now, you know plenty in G.R., and you know doggone well
you know you know plenty. Now don't you!"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, some nice ones. Rose and Francia and Lyra and Valerie,
my lively niece, and Nelly Sarouk and the Fliegends and Bradd and
Frank and Rev Gadd and Tracy and Chris and the Blackstaffs." She
meditated, and added musingly, "And Jay Laverick."</p>

<p>"I could do without quite so much of Jay."</p>

<p>"Oh, do be fair to him, Of course he's something of a pest, but
he's such a queer, lonely specimen&mdash;he needs
sympathy&mdash;and I'm sure he admires you much more than he does
me."</p>

<p>"He must admire me a lot then. Oh, let's forget Jay."</p>

<p>"Let's...Poor Jay."</p>

<p>The ore boat, thrice whistling, demanded that the Aerial Bridge
be lifted for its entrance to St. Louis Bay. And that night they
heard, from their hotel in Duluth, the fog horn&mdash;sounding
first like a moaning calf, then like giants moving their giant
furniture.</p>

<p>Fog and snorting tug-boats, thought Cass, and great ships upon
the waters! Some day Jinny and he would know them in Sydney Harbor
and Portsmouth and Rotterdam.<br>
<br></p>

<p>They took, for the rest of the hot summer, a lakeside cottage on
the north shore of Dead Squaw Lake. It was seven hundred and fifty
feet from the cottage shared by those professional bachelors, Bradd
Criley and Jay Laverick.</p>

<p>This tiny summer colony on Dead Squaw derisively called itself
Mushrat City. There were a dozen yellow or white shacks, running
mostly to porches, bath-houses, boat-houses, and wooden-floored
tents in which Junior and Sister slept.</p>

<p>Only one of them had a bar, and this was the Laverick-Criley
establishment. Inside, there were four cots, and a room containing
a divan-bed, ornamented with a silken coverlet and not visibly
used.</p>

<p>In the colony were the Pennlosses, the Drovers, the Brightwings,
the Beecher Filligans, Vincent Osprey, that forward-looking young
lawyer and his backward-looking wife Cerise, and Scott and Juliet
Zago, and into it dipped scores of visitors from the nearby Yacht
Club.</p>

<p>The true American is active even in his inactivities. The
Mushrat City colonists did not lie indolent watching the slow tides
of the water rise and merge with slow-revolving sky till heaven and
earth were all one sun-hued dream. No, they swam, they dove, they
sailed, they fished for bass, they drove into town for the movies,
they played bridge, they cooked steak and fish at outdoor grills,
they danced to the radio, they drank considerably and made love
cautiously.</p>

<p>Grand Republic was not a singularly philanderous community, but
at Mushrat City the more earnest strayers had classic surroundings:
deep pine woods, skiffs filled with cushions, and long plank piers
on which lounged the nymphs and fauns of Thessaly, with a few
satyrs. Yet among them all, only Jay Laverick was ever assailed as
an amorist, and his friend Bradd Criley defended him by insisting
that Jay merely flirted a little to cover up his one passionate
ideal, liquor.</p>

<p>At the neighboring Yacht Club, Dr. Roy Drover said to Bradd,
fairly publicly, "So Jay isn't a chaser, eh? I don't suppose you
are, either!"</p>

<p>"I certainly am not."</p>

<p>"What about Gillian Brown and Sabine the Gold-digger?"</p>

<p>"Well, what about them?"</p>

<p>"Weren't they seen leaving you two fellows' shack at dawn on
Wednesday?"</p>

<p>"Not by me they weren't. Did you see them?"</p>

<p>"Not personally."</p>

<p>"Then shut up about it, Roy. I can tell you confidentially, it's
a lie!"</p>

<p>"Okay by me, Bradd. It's no skin off my neck, anyway."</p>

<p>The Council of Elders, in the club bar, agreed that Dr. Drover
had been neatly answered. They went so far as to declare that,
whatever Jay did, Bradd was completely chaste: that is, naturally,
he had a few lady friends in St. Paul or Chicago, but he was
strictly&mdash;and in the long run profitably&mdash;pure and
impersonal with his women clients, his stenographers, and his
friends' wives and daughters.</p>

<p>All day Mushrat City brawled with children dashing into the
lake. Most of the men were in town, in their offices, except on
Saturday and Sunday, and now, in wartime, many of the women joined
them. Jinny and Rose Pennloss drove in every Wednesday and Friday,
to serve as waitresses in the soldiers' canteen or to take coffee
and sandwiches to the troop-trains. Cass, with his court closed,
went in thrice a week and served on the ration board and in bond
drives. All of Mushrat City was busy, and the only menace to its
morals was Jay Laverick.</p>

<p>It was unfortunate, thought Cass, that it was Jay whom Jinny
found most entertaining.</p>

<p>But so aboveboard was her liking for Jay, for his dancing, his
air of sardonic liveliness, and so frankly did she talk about him,
that Cass could see it would be very wrong to suspect her. They
could scarce avoid meeting, with the swimming, tennis, canoeing.
Jinny was a clean diver, and all afternoon at the Yacht Club, her
hands flashed like nimble daggers as she dealt at bridge, but in
all of these diversions Jay was the champion, when he was partly
sober. Cass assured himself that all this was desirable, and good
fun for Jinny.</p>

<p>But when Pasadena Filligan, Mrs. Beecher Filligan, who herself
liked Jay, gave to his favorite morning drink, gin and bitters, the
nickname of Jin and Jay, and it became current, then Cass was
vexed.<br>
<br></p>

<p>It was obvious that the one safe path for Jinny between empty
boredom and emptier philandering was to have children. "Let's drop
all precautions now and start the family," he blurted.</p>

<p>"Yes, let's," she said.</p>

<p>That was all.<br>
<br></p>

<p>They were having a decorous Sabbath-afternoon walk, Cass and Roy
Drover ambling on ahead of Jinny and Jay. The Cass who three months
ago would have looked back only to gladden his eye with the vision
of his sweet fair one could not keep from turning his head for less
tender spying.</p>

<p>He saw Jinny and Jay arm in arm. He saw Jay tuck her hand
between his arm and his side. He saw Jinny snatch it away, but not
too swiftly, after what seemed to be a laughing debate.</p>

<p>So Cass, the Better Sort of American Husband, unhearing Roy's
important remarks on wild rice as duck-feed, wanted to go back and
beg Jay please not to seduce his wife&mdash;please not&mdash;it
would be so much friendlier all round if Jay didn't&mdash;and would
Jinny please forgive him for mentioning it?</p>

<p>He realized that Jay saw his spying. Deserting the girl, Jay
galloped up and cried unctuously, "Boys, did you ever have a wild
cat bawl you out? That's what I've been getting. Jinny has been
giving me hell for trying to make Pasadena Filligan. Depict that,
will you? And me never so much as wondering whether Pas would or
wouldn't. All I know is, she's a good tennis partner. I should
chase her, or any other woman in G.R., when I already got a girl in
Fergus. You know I have a branch office there. Oh, damn all women,
even your brainy wife, Cass. Say, uh, Roy, is the health
commissioner going to get after the sewers down by my mill?"</p>

<p>But Jinny was walking airily, heel and toe, with a small smug
smile as the jaunty banner of her thoughts. She looked so gay! Cass
ached with the sense of all the monsters that might be coiling
around her recklessness.</p>

<p>&mdash;I'd hate to have her get involved, and go the smeary way
of all loose women. For my own honor, if there is such a thing, but
more for <i>her</i> honor and contentment. It would kill me to see
that secure smiling of hers turn diffident and scared and
appealing. Dear Jinny, don't be a fool. And that's the one thing I
can't ask you not to be.</p>

<p>So these provincial and middle-class and uncomplex
Sunday-afternoon strollers, a rural magistrate and his bourgeois
friends and his little country wife, obviously ungifted for the
passions and spiritual tortures of Bohemia or Mayfair or the
boulevards, straggled through the humble, sun-quivering balsam
aisles, and up to the Timberlane summer-cottage on the weedy
lake-shore.</p>

<p>The cottage, of pine clapboards apparently once painted green,
was airy as a birdcage. The roof sloped out over the screened
porch, which made up half the house and served as lounge,
dining-room, observation-post for recording the doings of the
Filligans and the Ospreys, on either side, and as Cass's bedroom,
with a frame and mattress swinging from four steel chains. Inside
the house were only a squat living-room, with a preposterous
granite fireplace, Jinny's narrow bedroom, the kitchen, with a
kerosene stove, and a toilet with a homemade shower-bath. Mrs.
Higbee and Cleo had a one-room tarpaper shack to themselves, behind
the main house. Cleo had become a sinister young huntress, a
chipmunk-stalker and a dabbler after fish.</p>

<p>The whole establishment was more camp than residence, and it
caught the scent of pines, the breezes that were always fleeing in
pretended panic from the lively colored, fresh-smelling lake.</p>

<p>Ah let us to the country hie, and seek an humble home, we little
care for marble halls and the woes of Tyre and Rome. Here
peacefulness and fruitfulness and family concord glow, and hearts
of happy harvesters with simple joys o'erflow. Ah, well we wot, we
city slaves, we pay a bitter scot for our tempestuous tragedies:
thank God, <i>they</i> know them not! Ibid.</p>

<p>When they came up to the cottage, Cass looked beseechingly at
Jay, hoping that he would have the sense to go home. This was no
Fred Nimbus whom he could bully. Jay had enough skill in his trade
of village gallant to be able to answer, "I don't know what you're
talking about. Do I understand you to mean that your wife, whom I
had supposed you to respect and honor as I do, is an unchaste
woman, or such a fool that any passer-by can mislead her?"</p>

<p>Oh, yes, he could kill Laverick, but he could never shame him,
never frighten him.</p>

<p>"How about a little bridge, the four of us?" Jay said
sunnily.</p>

<p>"Not for me. I don't feel like it. I just want to sit and chew
the rag with Roy," said Cass.</p>

<p>"Fine. Jinny, here's your chance to teach me some chess. You
must have learned enough from ole Cass by now to be fairly good.
We'll go up on the porch, like little mice, and not disturb the Big
Boys."</p>

<p>"Wonderful!" chirruped Jinny.</p>

<p>Cass and Roy sat sourly out under the trees, on a sawbuck and a
wheelbarrow.</p>

<p>Roy grumbled, "It's none of my business, but don't you know that
Jay isn't the kind of buzzsaw for little ladies to monkey
with?"</p>

<p>"Jay has a good line; he amuses her. But he's perfectly
harmless."</p>

<p>"Oh, yeah? Better make sure he doesn't amuse her too much. Now
don't get sore. I'm not going to butt in any farther. But just ask
Pas Filligan&mdash;or better yet, ask her husband&mdash;just how
harmless Jay is. Well, here's where I go over and turn in and get a
nap. So long...Bye, Jinny!...She never heard me."</p>

<p>Cass sat alone on the sawbuck, a seat too narrow for comfort but
surrounded by spruce chips and sawdust with a friendly smell. He
wanted some such small homeliness, for he was picturing a menacing
procession.</p>

<p>&mdash;Tracy Olesen, Eino Roskinen, Abbott Hubbs, Bertie
Eisenherz, Fred Nimbus, Jay Laverick. None of them dangerous, but I
wish she weren't quite so enthusiastic about the virtues of quite
so many nonentities.</p>

<p>When Jay was gone, Cass and Jinny swam out to the farther float.
He had a crawl-stroke, steady and uninspired as the pounding of a
freight-steamer, untiring and faster than it looked. She flirted
with the water like a sail boat. They sat then on the narrow
sand-beach, baking. She was tanned a soft brown; he, in his trunks,
chest hard and arching, was of a coppery red-Indian hue. Relaxed
thus, it was easier for him to blurt it all out:</p>

<p>"Sweet, I'm not jealous of Jay, but he's around here too much. A
bold desperado, that fellow. He always keeps it up till somebody
slaps him down. Won't you do it for me?"</p>

<p>"Oh, good Heavens, just because I enjoy playing tennis with him,
and he talks amusingly&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Quit that!"</p>

<p>"<i>What?</i>"</p>

<p>"I know all his virtues better than you do. He's been
conspicuously displaying them for a long time now. But you know and
I know that he's on the make, and what's worse, he knows perfectly
well that we know it, and if we allow him around here at all, we
practically confirm his ethics. I wish you'd tell him yourself to
quit acting the up-creek Casanova."</p>

<p>"Why, dearest, of course I will, if you want me to, though I
honestly don't think he has any yen for me whatever. He's far too
much interested in Pas Filligan." Her eyes were suddenly fixed and
angry. "Blast her!"</p>

<p>"Why, Jinny, you aren't <i>that</i> much taken with him? You
aren't jealous of Pas?"</p>

<p>"What? How? Of Pas? Heavens, no! I just meant I was irritated by
the whole gang of them&mdash;the Filligans and Jay and the whole
bunch. Aah! They're so sloppy. You're right. You're single-minded
and good."</p>

<p>That night he lay relaxed and secure, listening to the wind in
the pines, far in the north beside the lonely lake.<br>
<br></p>

<p>She chastened the petitionary Mr. Laverick simply and with
dreadful effectiveness. At a Yacht Club dance; the next Saturday,
when Jay was being especially attentive, she yelled publicly, "Why,
Mr. La-ver-ick, are you trying to flirt with me? Back to your Irish
bogs, ye little black divvle."</p>

<p>She knew that the one thing about which Jay was sensitive was
the extreme boggishness of his swarthy paternal grandfather, who
had been born between nothing and an east wind. When he had
migrated to America, he had worked on a railroad section-gang, and
had died in a kennel called The Pipes of Erin, which was a
Swedish-owned German saloon and Chinese chop-suey joint on
Washington Avenue, in Minneapolis.</p>

<p>Jay left her flat, and went to the bar. The good Judge was
surprised to find how pleased he was by her rudeness.</p>

<p>He spoke to Bradd Criley.</p>

<p>"I wish you'd have a talk with your friend Jay. He buzzes around
Jinny entirely too much."</p>

<p>"I certainly will. I'm fond of Jay, and he isn't as bad as he
acts but he is a crazy fool. I won't tell him you spoke to me,
Cass. I'll just say I admire Jinny, and will he lay off, or
else."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Bradd."</p>

<p>"And of course it's true. I've always loved Jinny like an uncle,
and I want to protect her almost as much as you do."</p>

<p>"I'm sure of it, and I'm mighty grateful."</p>

<p>So the truce of God was proclaimed, and Cass and Jinny were
trusting lovers again, sitting in the northern twilight, with Cleo
slipping ghost-like among the trees.</p>

<p>They settled to village peace by the lake, content with humbler
establishments than the summer estates of the Wargates or Bertie
Eisenherz, who had a small lake of his own. With Bertie, Jinny had
learned what trans-Atlantic passengers learn: that you never see
vacation-time intimates except on the street.</p>

<p>When she gave up the ways of dalliance, she went out for
swimming so powerfully that she became a threat to the lady Olympic
champions&mdash;for two weeks.</p>

<p>At all sports she was more deft and quick-learning and natural
than Cass. She dived, played tennis and golf, rode, paddled, with
joy and style and innate talent, and with innate sloppiness Cass
was awkward at learning, and he gave no signs of particularly
enjoying these games, but he mastered them better than Jinny, and
he wanted to keep on picking away at them long after she was
bored.</p>

<p>But all such competition vanished in the problems of comparative
wealth. Cass had become rich&mdash;for Cass.</p>

<h2>Chapter 31</h2>

<p>He came back from town, he yelled "Jin-nee!" in front of their
summer cottage, and brought her tumbling down out of an old
crabapple tree where she had been curled up asleep, with Cleo
asleep in her arms.</p>

<p>"Jinny," he inquired, "would you think one hundred and ten
thousand dollars was a lot of money?"</p>

<p>"I would think anything over five dollars was a lot of money.
Why?"</p>

<p>"That is the fabulous sum we now possess."</p>

<p>"Money! Dresses! Singhalese scarfs! A red collar for Cleo! A
'Liebestodt' record! Has somebody been bribing you? Oh, goody!"</p>

<p>"Nothing as interesting as that. Mm. Howl would hate to have
somebody offer me a hundred-thousand-dollar bribe! I'd have to
refuse it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Oh, you know."</p>

<p>"No, I don't! Why?"</p>

<p>"I can't explain why, but I would, of course,"</p>

<p>"How about <i>two</i> hundred thousand?"</p>

<p>"Now don't go on raising. I just refused one hundred thousand,
didn't I? Let's say hastily that we've proved the principle, and
get on with the experiment."</p>

<p>"But honestly, what would be your limit?"</p>

<p>"Jinny, how much would you want for selling your virtue?"</p>

<p>"To which man?"</p>

<p>"Say just an average man."</p>

<p>"Do you mean indoors or outdoors?"</p>

<p>"Say outdoors."</p>

<p>"Do you mean on a summer night like this, with a full moon, or a
night in January&mdash;Ah, poor sweet, you don't really think
that's funny, <i>do</i> you!"</p>

<p>"But listen now. This hundred thousand that we already
have&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And ten!"</p>

<p>"<i>And</i> ten. My father left me enough so I've been able to
keep about fifty thousand dollars ahead, put away in good
securities. And he also left me that block of stores and flats down
in the South End. Here lately, they were almost empty, paying me
almost nothing, but with Wargate's and the other factories doubling
war production, there's come to be a big shortage in housing in the
South End, and today Frank Brightwing told me he can get sixty
thousand dollars for the property, spot-cash, and I'd 've said it
wasn't worth more than thirty. Oh, Lord!"</p>

<p>"You're not glad. You don't want to do it?"</p>

<p>"I have done it. I have a nice check for sixty thousand dollars,
minus three-thousand commission, in my pocket."</p>

<p>"Oh, lemme see, lemme see, lemme see, good gracious sakes, let
me see that lovely thing!"</p>

<p>Together, solemnly, they looked at the meager slip of paper on
which was written "Fifty-seven thousand ($57,000 &amp; 00/100)" and
which, by the magic of this credulous era, would trustingly be
accepted by strangers in return for brick houses and roasts of beef
and tickets to Hamlet and safety for death-haunted refugees from
tyranny.</p>

<p>Jinny said reverently, "Now is that a pretty trick!
Hey&mdash;wait! Do you mean to tell me Frank Brightwing gets three
thousand dollars of our money? Why, I call that scandalous! But a
minute ago&mdash;Why were you oh-Lording? A thing like that elegant
piece of paper, I should think it would be something that all the
angels would rejoice over, and even Ma Prutt would look halfway
pleased. Why so pale and wan, young capitalist?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I dunno&mdash;to get this increased price&mdash;it seems
like profiteering on the war. Of course I can put most of it into
war bonds&mdash;"</p>

<p>No criminal lawyer has ever attacked more fierily than did
Jinny. Cass was smothered. She tore him down from thirty-five
thousand dollars of war bonds to five, and nearly had him down to
three, and within half an hour, without knowing better than any
layman how the contract had been put over, he had pledged himself
to his boss to invest another five thousand in more speculative
stocks, put forty-five thousand into a new house and the
appertaining furniture, and devote two thousand to their strictly
private blowing-in.</p>

<p>He fretted that Jinny was not overly generous in her patriotism,
but then he fretted that none of them were. Like almost every other
Good Citizen at any time, he did very little except the
fretting.</p>

<p>He did not know that he was committed, beyond the power of the
court, to buying the new house and deserting the ancient comfort of
Bergheim. He believed that he was "still thinking it over," and in
the security of that belief he went to sleep, that night, while
inside the cottage she sat brooding for hours, her small hands, so
apt at pencil, at golf-stick, at the hammer, clutched ardently,
like a child's, round her knees. She stared at a candle till the
tallow took shapes of towers and spires, of ocean steamers and
flaunting bridges, of studios in Paris, of a great stage in New
York and a little exciting figure in the center.</p>

<p>He awoke on his porch-swing to peer in at her, and clumped in to
kiss her excited cheeks, her clasped hands. She circled his neck
with bare arms, muttering, "Never any one but you, my darling. I do
want a lot of silly things, and you give them to me, but I want you
more. I wish sometimes it could be I who give, and not always
you."<br>
<br></p>

<p>The debate about buying a new house started all over again next
morning, as already-thoroughly-settled domestic debates always
do.</p>

<p>Cass said profoundly, "Uh&mdash;uh&mdash;About buying a new
house. And of course, with wartime restrictions, it will be
impossible to build one. And I don't honestly see any likelihood of
our caring for a house that somebody else has arranged to suit
themselves. Do you see?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it&mdash;I think this grape fruit and orange marmalade
knocks the spot off straight orange. You, Cleo, you get off this
table, and don't knock over Isis, either."</p>

<p>"I think it's absolutely superstitious of you, if not infantile,
to have that crystal image always in sight, honey."</p>

<p>"Isn't it though! See Frazer, The Golden Bough. Yes. You know,
we'll have trouble making room enough for all your books in the new
house, <i>whichever</i> one we get."</p>

<p>"But I don't&mdash;That's what I want to talk about."</p>

<p>"I knew it, I knew it, oh, my pet, I absolutely knew it. I said
to a robin, when I woke this morning, I said, 'Robin, I'll bet you
two worms that Mr. Timberlane will want to talk about the insanity
of buying a new house.'"</p>

<p>"Well, I do."</p>

<p>"Do what, Judge?"</p>

<p>"Think so."</p>

<p>"Think what?"</p>

<p>"That we must consider very carefully whether we really want to
do this. We have a very fine old house now, and to get a new one
would be spending our <i>capital</i>."</p>

<p>"But you can sell the old one."</p>

<p>"I don't know whether that would be so easy."</p>

<p>"But if it's such a grand fine old place as you say?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, that's&mdash;Have to protect our capital. I might
very easily be defeated for judge at the next election, and then
what would we have to live on?"</p>

<p>"You might practise a little law and make a&mdash;what is it? a
modicum?&mdash;maybe about five times as much as your present
salary, and so we'd get along?"</p>

<p>"Maybe."</p>

<p>"Darling!" She stopped being flippant; she spoke like the first
young cavewoman in the morning of history who resolved that her
mate and she must leave their damp cave on the hillside and
struggle down into the bright dangerous plains. "Let's be young
while we're still young!"</p>

<p>"I know," he said.</p>

<p>"Let's get a house in the Country Club District&mdash;if we can
find one, I mean, that isn't too expensive&mdash;gay and shiny and
lots of light&mdash;not like our old morgue in town."</p>

<p>"Bergheim isn't a morgue."</p>

<p>"The corpses never know that a morgue is a morgue."</p>

<p>"I didn't know you felt that way about it."</p>

<p>"I didn't, till this minute. And you know, really the chief
thing I'm thinking about is how much more convenient a modern
kitchen would be for Mrs. Higbee."</p>

<p>"Overruled."</p>

<p>"Well, anyway, I did think some about it, and some about me
entertaining in a Spanish drawing-room, looking like the Duchess of
Windsor."</p>

<p>"Baby, you're either as childish as Juliet Zago, or&mdash;You
really want a new house?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I'll think about it."</p>

<p>They knew what that meant.<br>
<br></p>

<p>He drove into town and, as though he had not seen it for several
years, he stared at Bergheim, his boyhood notion of a castle, his
first citadel as a citizen, a counselor, a judge, the lifelong
repository of his dreams, filled with contradictory and devastating
memories of Blanche and Jinny.</p>

<p>He clumped through the house&mdash;noticing how surprisingly
much cat-hair Cleo had managed to leave on the chairs&mdash;and he
was certain that he would miss these solid walls, these uncramped
rooms, the irregular hallways and unexpected closets. In the
backyard he admired the carriage-house with its haughty cupola
which, as a boy, he had considered the seal of elegance. He mooned
over the espaliered pears, the thick and comfortable backyard grass
that takes a generation to grow, the view from the bluff across
twin valleys. He knew here a little of the tradition that makes a
Leicestershire squire, a Silesian Junker, a gentleman of Touraine
quiet and enduring and dangerous.</p>

<p>This Country Club District that Jinny coveted&mdash;it was a
parvenu colony next to the Heather golf course, on a peninsula
thrust out from the south shore of Dead Squaw Lake. This
"brand-new, up-to-the-second, streamlined home-development for
gracious living" had been planned for the sons of Ottawa Heights,
the grandsons of the extravagant mansions on Beltrami Avenue South,
and newcomers who had wriggled their way into this
three-whole-generations aristocracy. The houses there were sleek
and well planned; they had steel-and-glass kitchens and tinted
toilet-paper; but they were too close together, too small, too much
like hotel-suites.</p>

<p>Thus meditating, he returned to Mushrat City, to coax Jinny
please not to buy a house but do a lot of striking things with
paint at Bergheim.</p>

<p>She met him clamoring, "Beautiful, Pas Filligan says she thinks
we'd like the Simmers house&mdash;you know, that Spanish-hacienda
number just beyond the Heather Club. She says the inside is
wonderful and behind it," reverently, "there's a swimming-pool!
Lemme in the car, lemme in! Let's go see it right now. There's a
key at the club. Let's go!"</p>

<p>Somehow, as they drove round the lake, Cass could not advocate
painting the Bergheim kitchen, and putting tin over the major
rat-holes, as a substitute for a hacienda-house with a
swimming-pool.</p>

<p>And it was quite a house, too.</p>

<p>From the front they saw a roof of alternate red and yellow
tiles, a wooden ox-bow with two ship's-lanterns suspended from it,
and an outside cement stairway leading down to a honeysuckle bush
that was not really remarkable enough to have a special stairway
for it.</p>

<p>&mdash;Mm. They probably use the stairs for jumping off into
snowdrifts in winter.</p>

<p>He was rigidly silent; she was silent like a head-turning little
bird, as they went through the place. The rooms were small and,
with tiled floors and imitation-antique beams, as oppressive as
cells. Above the Mexican fireplace in the living-room a long crack
in the wall showed that, after only ten years, the house was
sinking. They considered the kitchen, daintily done in pink, green,
dark blue, and bronze, and went out to the swimming-pool, which was
a nothingness lined with cracked cement.</p>

<p>Then Jinny spoke, tenderly.</p>

<p>"All right, all right, Judge. I always did think it was a
mistake for us to invite Cortez over."</p>

<p>But it seemed to be understood between them that, since she had
so freely rejected this horror, he could not suggest that they
should not buy a new house at all.</p>

<p>They knew the house hunter's shameless joy of intrusion; of
looking into closets full of forlorn clothes, medicine cabinets
with surprising accessories, sumptuous wine-closets that contained
nothing but a bottle and a half of rye and one can of sardines.
They studied and extensively talked about terraces, tennis courts,
linen closets, automatic-feed furnaces, "breakfast nooks," and
basements which, containing pool tables and home-made bars, were
appallingly known as "rumpus-rooms."</p>

<p>Frank Brightwing, their real-estate expert, grew irritable, Cass
was exhausted, but Jinny strode on, unquenchable. She could examine
the eighteenth closet in sequence with undiminished enthusiasm, and
three days later could remember the dimensions of each closet and
how many hangers there were in it and whether it had a full-length
mirror in the door. It did not, however, occur to Frank or to Cass
that, with the opportunity, she would have been a better
real-estate man than either of them.</p>

<p>They decided quite suddenly on a house, in the Country Club
District, which they had twice dismissed as "too plain" and now saw
as dignified in its simplicity: a plaster house with a flat roof
and drawing-room windows down to the floor; what Brightwing called
"a fine restrained example of the French-type house." It could just
as well have been called an English-type house, a Lombardy-type
house, or a Salzkammergut-type house; it was, in fact, a plaster
house. It had almost as many closets as Jinny wanted, almost as
much radiator-surface as Cass wanted, a cubbyhole for Cass's desk,
and a good view across the lake.</p>

<p>Jinny said that the long windows would be "nice for a
lawn-party&mdash; people can run in and out." Cass thought it would
be abominable to have people running in and out, whether through
doors, windows or chimneys, and he considered floor-length windows
a wretched idea for Minnesota winters. But if she was happy, then
so was he.</p>

<p>The house had been built for Harold W. Whittick, owner of
Station <i>kich</i>, who had moved into a flat in one of the few
apartment houses in Grand Republic, to be near his radio
station&mdash;or, as he put it, "to the transmission of the
critical bulletins of this portentous hour of conflict."</p>

<p>Neither Cass nor Harold W. Whittick knew that Groseilliers and
Radisson, possibly the first white men in Minnesota, had camped
upon this site in 1660. It is a pity that Harold did not know. He
might have given those explorers the most gratifying publicity
throughout this rich agricultural and dairying section with
convenient access to all railroads and wholesale markets.<br>
<br></p>

<p>In treachery to her years at Bergheim, Mrs. Higbee placidly
preferred the new house and the new kitchen, and perhaps Isis did
also&mdash;she did not indicate. But Cleo was melancholy about
it.</p>

<p>Jinny insisted on their taking a special journey from Mushrat
City to show Cleo her new home, and when Cass objected that the
government wanted them to save gasoline, Jinny explained, "Now do
you suppose the President is going to say to the Secretary of War,
'Look, Harry, there's that dratted Jinny Marshland wasting gas on a
cat?' I bet they won't even notice."</p>

<p>It was not easy to convince Jinny that Cleo might be so occupied
in her office of grand inquisitor to the heretic field mice that
she could endure waiting another day.</p>

<p>When Cleo did actually see the place, she was difficult about
it. They followed her while she examined every room. She repeatedly
stopped to ask "Meow?" in a way that said, "Is this all?"</p>

<p>There were&mdash;Cleo counted them&mdash;not so many rooms as at
Bergheim. There were no unlighted closets, no dark attic stairs, no
exquisite dark triangles of space under the eaves, no trapdoors, no
earth-floored corners in the basement, no place at all where a
respectable cat might expect mice or beetles, or could hide from a
harsh and mocking world.</p>

<p>"I suppose you sympathize with that animal," sighed Jinny, in a
sad little voice.</p>

<p>"No, no," Cass lied. "Maybe we'll miss the old barracks for a
while, but I already love this place more, because you're more in
it, in every line."</p>

<p>So Cleo went off in a huff and was found in the empty garage,
growling.<br>
<br></p>

<p>They would use but little furniture from Bergheim in the new
house; they would leave the old castle as it was, and rent it till
it should be sold. They had their sprees of buying, in Grand
Republic, in St. Paul and Minneapolis, and then, in mid-August, he
blurted out the plan that he had been nursing.</p>

<p>Except for the Florida journey, she had still never been east of
Chicago.</p>

<p>"We'll have to wait for all the new furnishings to arrive, and
meanwhile, what do you say to our taking another honeymoon trip?"
he said.</p>

<p>"Do you think we ought to? Spending so much money&mdash;we'll
have to economize. Oh. I <i>must</i> remember to turn off the
lights when I leave a room."</p>

<p>"But later we may not get much chance&mdash;be less and less
travel with the war on and&mdash;suppose the trip I was thinking of
was to New York?"</p>

<p>"New York!" she said reverently.<br>
<br></p>

<p><b>An Assemblage of Husbands and Wives</b>
</p>

<p><i>Nestor &amp; Fanny Purdwin</i>
</p>

<p>Nestor Purdwin was born in an October gale in Illinois in 1871.
He came to Minnesota in a blizzard in 1890, and married Fanny Clark
during an April freshet in 1891, with the roads deplorable but the
horizon clear.</p>

<p>He was next-to-the-best criminal lawyer in Grand Republic, and
he was honest. He never knowingly declared that a scoundrel or a
man of cruelty was harmless, though he might assert that there were
excuses for him. He represented many of the labor unions, but he
was also summoned by corporations in civil cases, because they
often needed an adviser who could say No.</p>

<p>He was a middleroad-to-leftwing Democrat and a convinced
Episcopalian. He detested Sweeney Fishberg for being a Jew, an
Irishman, a Catholic, a mystic, and a Communist. In the old days,
when he had once been associated in a trial with Clarence Darrow,
he had detested Darrow for being an agnostic and a
socialist-anarchist-syndicalist-populist. Yet in most suits and on
most committees he had somehow found himself standing with Fishberg
and Darrow, and when the veteran liberal, Salem Volk, from Queen
City, came to town, he stayed, often and argumentatively, with the
Purdwins.</p>

<p>He was always roaring. He roared equally against high-church
rectors named Cecil and Four Square Gospellers named Pete, against
tabloid newspapers and glossy magazines and "fool women who are too
lazy to read the papers and magazines."</p>

<p>He had never gone to college, but he read Plato, Voltaire,
Alexander Pope, Mencken, Bernard Shaw, and Sir Thomas Browne.</p>

<p>Fanny and he had been married for fifty years, and had bickered
continuously in a tart, humorous, satisfied way, and she never
failed to defend him against everybody else with whom he
bickered.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know how cranky he must 've been to you. The man is
worse than a bear in a beehive. But don't tell <i>me</i> about it.
I love him."</p>

<p>When Judge Blackstaff was reported as having said that Mr.
Purdwin was "not a gentleman," Fanny mused, "Ain't he? That's good.
Neither am I."</p>

<p>For fifty years they had slept in an immense, bosomy double-bed.
His parting kiss to her each morning was a testy little peck on the
lips, but if he forgot it, she was grieved for an hour&mdash;but
never for more than an hour&mdash;and she never reproached him for
it.</p>

<p>Exactly once in the fifty years he had tried an
extra-matrimonial experiment with a hotel stenographer. He had
neither enjoyed it, repeated it, nor told her about it.</p>

<p>He loved porridge for breakfast, and every morning, three
hundred and sixty-five mornings a year, they had porridge. It was
after thirty-two years of it that Fanny reported, a bit
reluctantly, "I think I'm beginning to like the nasty stuff."</p>

<h2>Chapter 32</h2>

<p>The Timberlanes followed the ancient line of provincial tourists
going to the capitals: Boeotians to Athens, Tatar caravans to
Tibet, Artie and Mrs. Beppin of the Five Towns to London: excited,
credulous, terrified of the boorishness and cheating that they
expected to encounter.</p>

<p>The question, ancient before the first woman from Petra went up
to Jerusalem, of whether Jinny should have new dresses made at home
or get them more splendidly in the metropolis, was as usual
compromised. She bought a gray suit that Harley Bozard assured her
was a "fast little number, just in from New York," and left the
rest for Babylon.</p>

<p>Their train from Chicago to New York was an arrow of light. They
had a compartment, this time, and none of their honeymoon
apprehension. The train was filled with the most beautiful people,
lovely girls, saintly old ladies, smooth but stalwart men with
clothes and shell-rimmed spectacles and wrist-watches right out of
the magazine advertisements.</p>

<p>Cass let himself relax and enjoy it. In his days in Congress he
had not gone to New York often enough to be weary of it, and he was
all holiday. He spoke not only to the Pullman porter, to whom it
was no novelty, but to a clergyman and a traveling-man, and when a
man in herring-bone tweed invited him to play bridge, and chuckled,
"I warn you, though, the wife and I are professional gamblers,"
Cass answered, "My wife certainly is. She gambled on marrying
me."</p>

<p>The man thought that was a pretty good joke.</p>

<p>The man said to his wife, "Our new friend here has made a pretty
good joke."</p>

<p>She said, "Come on now&mdash;don't be a tightwad&mdash;what's
his pretty good joke?"</p>

<p>"He said the little woman took a worse risk in getting hitched
to him than she ever did in bridge."</p>

<p>"Yes, and what a gamble <i>he</i> took on getting <i>you</i> to
handle the rights to his pretty good joke. Let's go!"</p>

<p>They played bridge through sixteen counties and forty-two
college towns of Ohio, and had four Scotch highballs and shook
hands all round. Jinny had won sixty-two cents and a lipstick, and
Cass had lost one dollar.</p>

<p>"I'm a little drunk," he said with self-approval, as they wove
into their compartment.</p>

<p>"You get younger every day. When I first met you, you were
sixty-one. Now you're a bright thirty-four," she approved.</p>

<p>They were up early. People from Grand Republic do get up at the
most surprising times and places. Along the Hudson, the river of
Presidents, Jinny was thrilled by West Point, the Taj Mahal, and
the leaves of Vallombrosa. Suddenly there was an apartment house
twenty stories high, and he exulted, "This is it!" She held his
hand softly, and whispered, "I love you!"</p>

<p>But the Grand Central Terminal was too much for her: an
underground city in which all the inhabitants were going to a fire.
She clung to her stalwart Cass, a fellow who could beat off these
shoving maniacs, as they doubtfully gave their precious,
so-neatly-packed bags over to a redcap, dotted up an incline,
crossed through an incredible room a thousand feet tall, and took a
taxicab, not in the wholesome fresh air but in a tunnel. In the
taxi she still snuggled close to him for protection, and fluttered,
"I'm going to have a magnificent time, but let me catch my breath.
Does it get any worse?"</p>

<p>As they blessedly came out into the light, she found that part
of the taxi roof was of glass, and she gazed up in beatific
idiocy.</p>

<p>"Look! Up there! That must be the Empire State Building or the
Wrigley Building or something! Oh, jiminy, they are high. You
know&mdash;high! I never felt so small. Don't you dare leave me one
minute all the time we're here!"</p>

<p>She was less exalted when the taxicab stopped meechingly at the
Melchester Arms, which Bradd Criley, as an expert on New York, had
recommended. "It's smaller and less expensive, but it's one of the
smartest hotels in town," he said. "That's where the real New
Yorkers go, say while they're opening up their apartments in the
fall." (Actually, the only native New Yorkers who frequented the
Melchester were clothes-pressers, jobbing barbers, and telegraph
messengers.)</p>

<p>It was a smaller hotel and rather plainer than the Pineland,
back home, and the lobby was a block of darkness surrounding a
large oak table with piles of magazines about travel and the
Y.M.C.A. upon it. The clerk was a short, scaly, ill-disposed man
with that thin and revelatory hair which is balder than baldness.
He looked up at them as though he was getting good and tired of
having strangers come in and speak to him without an
introduction.</p>

<p>"I, uh&mdash;we have a reservation for a two-room suite," said
Cass.</p>

<p>"What is the name?"</p>

<p>"Timberlane. Grand Republic. Minnesota."</p>

<p>The clerk, after having looked painstakingly through a file of
cards containing names beginning with I and E, sighed, "What was
that name again?"</p>

<p>"Timberlane."</p>

<p>"Oh. I see! With a T. Tamburlaine."</p>

<p>"No, no. <i>Timberlane</i>. Tamburlaine is from Marlowe."</p>

<p>"Well, we get a lot of people from Marlowe, too. The Melchester
is a great favorite with all you folks from the Middle-west."</p>

<p>As he laboriously went at the cards again, Jinny muttered, Why
don't you tell him you're a judge and an ex-congressman, and give
him a good time? He needs one."</p>

<p>"Kitten, in this town, everybody's an ex-congressman. We're just
a couple of rural nobodies."</p>

<p>"And how! This suit that Harley sold me&mdash;I'm beginning to
find potato bugs and alfalfa seeds in it. But Aloysius here is no
Vanderbilt. I suppose New York has the biggest
everything&mdash;even the biggest hicks. Let me slap him, darling,
just once."</p>

<p>The clerk turned to them again and said accusingly,
"<i>Timberlane</i>, that's the name!"</p>

<p>"That's so," admitted Cass.</p>

<p>"Front!" said the clerk, suspiciously.</p>

<p>The elderly bellboy awoke from his dreams of the Civil War,
conducted them to their suite, and gloomily accepted fifty cents.
He was barely gone when Jinny protested, "Four bits? For that jerk?
I'd of brought the bags up for ten cents! There you go, being the
typical tourist you read about, overtipping and hurling thousands
of dollars around when you have a greedy wife that could use it for
luncheon-sets. Okay. Bankrupt the firm and see if I care."</p>

<p>They had recovered the gaiety which had been dimmed in the hotel
lobby, and they went down, arm in arm, to ask of the clerk where
they could get theater tickets for tonight.</p>

<p>Maybe there was a ticket agency, over on Sixth Avenue and down
three blocks? How would he know? He was busy, and really it wasn't
his job&mdash;</p>

<p>They left him hastily and at the agency inquired benevolently,
like people willing to spend their money and confer a favor,
whether for tonight they could get superior seats for Life with
Father or for Arsenic and Old Lace.</p>

<p>The agent said genially, "You folks from out of town?"</p>

<p>"How did you guess it?" Jinny said viciously.</p>

<p>He looked at her, unanswering, he winked at her husband, and he
offered, "I can get you tickets for either show for about the
middle of next November. What you want for tonight is Slips and
Slippers."</p>

<p>"Do we?" worried Cass.</p>

<p>"Maybe not. I wouldn't know. All I'm telling you is that it's
the best musical in New York for ten years, and I happen to have
two good seats, but if you don't want 'em&mdash;"</p>

<p>The seats cost $6.60 each.</p>

<p>When they were outside, Jinny begged, "Have you any room in your
vest-pocket, now you've taken out all that money?"</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"That rat made me feel so small when he winked at you that I
could fit right in alongside your watch now. Jinny isn't up to this
town. They got street-cars and everything. Could we go back to
Grand Republic right after the show tonight? Slips and Slippers!
Six-sixty! Look! He meant sixty-six cents, didn't he?"<br>
<br></p>

<p>Their train had arrived in mid-morning. All day they viewed New
York, by bus and elevated and taxicab. There was so fabulously much
to master that they felt they would never master any of it. To them
it was all a jungle-spawning of people and buildings, fierce and
purposeless. The tempo of the city rattled them: the quick turn of
everyone's head, the hard glance, the high nasal intensity of the
voices.</p>

<p>They came back to their hotel suite&mdash;correct enough in its
white paneling, but inhuman&mdash;and fell desperately asleep and
awakened almost too late for their musical show. Jinny insisted
that it was Isis, continuing her education by staring out of the
window at the Manhattan streets, who had aroused them.</p>

<p>They reasoned that it would be clever to have a sandwich within
walking-distance of the theater, and dine sumptuously at some gaudy
restaurant afterward. Cass told Jinny that he had been responsibly
informed that in Madrid people dined as late as ten-thirty.
Probably even eleven. She said brightly, Yes, she had heard so.</p>

<p>It made them feel that they were already in Europe.</p>

<p>They found a Broadway restaurant the size of Grand Republic,
with lovely black and red signs announcing that here one might have
sandwiches made of smoked turkey, caviar, deviled ham with chives,
or sixteen other rich materials. Nothing like this at home! they
rejoiced.</p>

<p>The farther hill-country of the interior of the restaurant was
filled with daises, mezzanines, balconies, and quarter-decks, while
the valley was jammed with circular bars, S-shaped lunch-counters,
wall-seats, divans, and booths, and all of these filled, and twenty
people herded at the door waiting, apologetic for wanting to eat
during wartime, while the restaurant's private supreme court looked
at the trespassers punitively. With the other prisoners waited
Judge and Mrs. Timberlane. They felt that there was something
obscene about wanting to eat at all, in this choking atmosphere of
corned beef and cabbage, among this queue of dehumanized serfs who
had no longer any power of resentment.</p>

<p>Jinny answered something that Cass hadn't yet even said with,
"You're telling <i>me</i> you like Grand Republic better!"</p>

<p>When they were finally herded to a table for two, they found
that by merely cutting off one arm and one leg each, and balancing
the glass of water on the sandwich plate which rested on the
unordered and unwanted plate of shredded cabbage under which were
tucked the knives and forks and the paper napkins, they could
manage very well.</p>

<p>Their sandwiches were called Oaxaca Specials, and among other
ores they recognized bacon, peanut butter, currant jelly, chicken
feet and iodine. It cost one dollar.</p>

<p><i>Each</i> of the sandwiches cost one dollar.</p>

<p>Jinny whimpered, "About that Grand Republic now. I shall never
leave it again. Oh, that beautiful, beautiful hash we used to have,
back in civilization!"</p>

<p>On the Street again, she speculated, "Couldn't we give our
tickets to one of these pencil-sellers and magic ourselves back
to&mdash;Let's go over to the Zagos and have some rummy. I never
realized what a wide-browed genius Juliet Zago is. Wouldn't I like
to see her and Scott right this minute! Pal, could I please kick
the next couple that crowd me into the gutter? I guess maybe it
would be wonderful to be in New York, if all seven million of 'em
didn't want to occupy the same spot we're walking over, all at the
same time."</p>

<p>They arrived in the theater as in a calm haven, but that was the
last calm they felt till they were back in their hotel, with Jinny
trying to explain it all to Isis.</p>

<p>They never did discover what the musical play was about. From
having attended the more salacious burlesque shows in Minneapolis,
when he was a student, Cass had a few notions, but Jinny was
entirely bewildered. There was, in the plot, a young lieutenant who
was serving in Tahiti, but as he was simultaneously rowing on the
Vassar crew and selling paper drinking-cups to a Turkish harem, it
was hard to follow his stream of consciousness. There was also a
pair of funny fellows with jokes about the less attractive
vices.</p>

<p>Cass and Jinny sat with hand tight in hand, unsmiling,
uncomfortable, wondering what the laughter was about. At
intermission, Jinny said only "Six-sixty!" but after the show, as
they hobbled away through the funereally festive crowd, "I'm
old-fashioned and I like it! Honey, if we got a plane, a very fast
plane, maybe we could see Cleo before dawn&mdash;and find out if
that beast of an upholsterer at Tarr's has the curtains up in the
new house yet. You know, they always advertise how fast you can fly
to New York, but what would inspire deep public confidence would be
to tell how fast and far you can get away from New York. Oh, my
sweet, you've got poor Jinny caught and happy in a sun-trap at home
for the rest of her life!"<br>
<br></p>

<p>They had read, in the syndicated gossip columns devoted to the
gracious doings of cafe society, about the Marmoset Club, that
debonair night restaurant, that Bowery saloon in a velvet
evening-cloak, where cigarette-bejittered heiresses are
photographed with flyers, and cinema press-agents exchange
copyrighted wisecracks with abortionists, but after the Broadway
sandwich-abbatoir, they were ready to be disappointed. Yet the
Marmoset was even more select, smart, exclusive, fashionable,
knowing, chic, gracious, elegant, decorative, glamorous,
glittering, glistening, shimmering, witty, sophisticated, mundane,
gay, international, deft, urbane, and generally expensive than had
been proclaimed by the columnists.</p>

<p>The very small lobby was a jewel-box in which stood a young
gentleman with the clothes of a whisky advertisement, the eyes of a
detective, the gentle effrontery of a diplomat, and the accent of
the Bronx.</p>

<p>"Uh&mdash;" said Cass, and again, "Uh&mdash;can we get a
table?"</p>

<p>"Have you a reservation?"</p>

<p>"N-no."</p>

<p>Jinny said in perfectly clear, sweet, womanly tones, "Let's get
the hell out of here. I don't like him."</p>

<p>The palace eunuch instantly recognized her then as a
distinguished movie actress, and he said almost humbly, "I'll see
what I can do. I'm sure I can find you something, madame."</p>

<p>He did quite well for them, too. He found a table in the
Que-Voulez-Vous Room, the largest of the five that made up the
Marmoset, despite the fact that it was almost half full.</p>

<p>Well, and it was a beautiful room, and Cass and Jinny had to
admit it; better even than the Fiesole Room at the Hotel Pineland,
back home. The walls were lined with gray silk, tucked and flaring;
under the crimson ceiling were constellations of crystal; and there
was a delicate, rustling quiet except at a center table where a
male clothes-designer was breaking a rather elderly lady's heart
and in a corner where an authoress was breaking her contract.</p>

<p>Word had been carried by the restaurant's efficient O.G.P.U.
that the pretty girl with the white mantle was somebody important
in Hollywood and the man with her either a doctor or a major in
mufti. This was no sensation at the Marmoset. That new Monte Carlo
could really have been stirred only by the appearance of the
President with Queen Nefertiti. But it did insure a captain of
waiters coming to take their order without disciplining them by
making them wait.</p>

<p>However, by the ease with which he sold them a bottle of
Peruvian champagne and mushrooms a noisette under glass, he could
see that here was only another dull pair of uncelebrities. He
passed the word, and Cass and Jinny went back into the
refrigerator. No one even glanced at them, except the male
designer, who looked designing.</p>

<p>Cass saw Jinny's spirit paling in her, and he urged abruptly,
"Well, you're the prettiest girl here. There isn't one that has
your fire or your eyes or a clear skin like yours."</p>

<p>"And you're the only man here that looks as if he could fight a
battle or build a town."</p>

<p>More silence, out of which she burst, "If I saw Boone and
Queenie Havock over at a table there, I'd go over and I'd kiss both
of 'em. Twice. And I would request Boone, but very nicely, to stand
up and holler, 'Do you clams know who this is? This is Judge
Timberlane and his young wife, d' you hear me?'"</p>

<p>"And Boone would probably do it."</p>

<p>"And Boone would certainly do it. That's why I adore
him&mdash;now."</p>

<p>That was Monday evening, the end of Jinny's first day among the
revelries of New York.</p>

<p>Comfortingly close to each other, they slept in one of the twin
beds, for shelter against the bleak wind of urban indifference,
while all night the little crystal cat looked out on the prison
wall of the New York street. It seemed very small on the broad
white sill.</p>

<p>There is a Grand Republic colony in New York, as there is a
Smyrna colony, a Benares colony, a Reykjavik colony, and it is the
duty of that colony to be gleeful at the arrival of all visitors
from the home town, and to take them to that restaurant at which
the ordeal of being cordial can be most quickly got over most
inexpensively. Equally, it is the duty of the visitors to telephone
to all members of the colony upon arrival and to allow themselves
to be becordialed. (There are also cases in which the two parties
to the social contract really want to see each other.)</p>

<p>With a notion of being thoughtful and not binding them, Cass had
not written of his coming to any of the colonists, nor to Dennis
Thane, the only one of his classmates in the University of
Minnesota law school whom he knew to be in New York. The stuttering
task of finding his old acquaintances he took up on Tuesday
morning, while Jinny, cocking her bare toes, commented with
ribaldry from the rumpled bed.</p>

<p>Mrs. Byron Grannick? She was still at Stockbridge.</p>

<p>Dr. Cope Anderson, the chemist? He was still at his laboratory
on Cape Cod.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Kenny Wargate? They were still at Easthampton.</p>

<p>By now Cass felt empty and unwanted.</p>

<p>He reached only Dennis Thane (of the law-firm of Crossbow,
Murphy, and Thane), who invited them for lunch tomorrow, and Bradd
Criley's sister, Mrs. William Elderman, Avis Criley Elderman, who
forebodingly insisted on coming into town from her suburban home in
Darien, Connecticut, and on performing the rite of taking them to
dinner on Thursday evening.</p>

<p>"Anyway, we have two friends in the world, Dennis and Avis,
except for Avis," sighed the lonely Judge Timberlane.</p>

<p>He had not quite dared telephone to one former Grand Republican,
the only person from their section of Minnesota, aside from Salem
Volk the veteran liberal politician, who was famous to the whole
world: Berg Nord, the actor-director-producer-dramatist, who had
been born on a farm in Radisson County. In fact Nord was so
distinguished that every citizen back home was under a compulsion
to inform strangers, "Oh, we don't take Berg seriously. We still
call him 'Ice Berg.' He don't try to pull anything on us, like
maybe he does on you folks. We know him too well."</p>

<p>Nord's latest play, Feast of Reason, of which he was author and
star, had just re-opened for the second year of its run. Back home,
Cass had airily thought of telephoning to Nord about tickets&mdash;
though he would insist on paying for them, of course&mdash;but now,
with the baby-tiger purr of New York outside his window, he dared
not telephone to Nord at all, but after breakfast trotted meekly to
the ticket agency, where the learned vendor condescendingly let him
have two seats. Cass held them with pride...He had never seen Berg
on the stage, but as a child of three, he had ridden pickaback on
the shoulders of the twenty-three-year-old Cousin Berg Nord. Now he
asked of the omniscience, "Nord is considered a fine actor in New
York, isn't he?"</p>

<p>"Oh, merely the best, after Lunt, that's all!"</p>

<p>Cass had lost another inch of stature by the time he had
regained the safety of their hotel and Jinny's presence.</p>

<h2>Chapter 33</h2>

<p>They never could recall how they had put in the rest of Tuesday
morning, aside from reading the papers down to the auction notices,
but they postponed the duty of reveling in the joys of New York
till lunchtime. Then they had the great hours of shopping, and
admitted that, in this, New York was superior. Jinny dropped the
arm of her protector and stepped out and had a few things to say
for herself.</p>

<p>She contradicted clerks, high impressive clerks with
handkerchiefs like bishops' mitres in their breast-pockets. She
yearned over furs and Irish linens and perfume-bottles with gold
crowns for stoppers and folding card-tables so sturdy that you
could sit on them&mdash;the clerk enthusiastically proved it. (He
was fired for it, that evening; the table might have collapsed.)
But there was a hard shrewdness in her, and she bought only one per
cent of the things that she would die if she did not have.</p>

<p>After dozens of tryings-on, while Cass sat on a plush chair in
rooms carpeted to suffocation and wondered if he might smoke, and
wished that he had a walking stick to rest his chin on, like the
other male sitters, she did pick out a silk dress, a blue suit, and
a lynx jacket.</p>

<p>Then she dropped again into panic.</p>

<p>"Cass! Let's beat it! So many shops, so many puss-puss
grass-widow clerks, trying to stick you with things you don't
want&mdash;they all get so blurry and alike. There's no fun like
there is at Harley's or Tarr's, where you know all the scandals
about the clerks. I love you for bringing me to New York, and I
wouldn't have missed it for a million dollars, and I wouldn't ever
come here again for a billion. Oh, I do want to settle down now. I
promise: I will read my chess manual. I will quit getting my queen
taken. I promise!"</p>

<p>He kissed her in the elevator of a department store.<br>
<br></p>

<p>They assured themselves that though the Melchester dining-room
did look stuffy, "We better have our dinner here, just this once,
and not have to hurry to the theater."</p>

<p>The air of the dining-room had been shut in there, among the
Brussels sprouts and the damp napkins, ever since the hotel had
opened, in 1913, and the stuffed veal tasted like the air, and the
waiter, who was a family man and a commuter, had aching feet.</p>

<p>They spent most of their time at dinner in longing for the
gaieties of the John William Prutts, and they went to the play as
to an operation.</p>

<p>Cass knew Nord only as a bulky, tow-headed Swede in a loose
black suit and an irregular bow-tie, lounging around his father's
farm. Jinny had never seen great acting, and she supposed that
there would be a good deal of yelling and throwing up one's arms
and catching them again.</p>

<p>Bewildered, they learned tonight that great theater is more real
than reality. Nord was the Little Man, a clerk who discovers that
his boss and his wife and his daughters are all liars, who smashes
his world and triumphs in defeat.</p>

<p>Jinny commented only, "Gee!"</p>

<p>Cass said, "I think in these theaters you can&mdash;'go back,' I
think they call it, and see the actors in their dressing-rooms, and
of course I've known Berg slightly all my life&mdash;I didn't
suppose he was like that! He's an archangel. I'm glad I saw this
with you. Well, shall we go back?"</p>

<p>"I'm scared to, but if you're sure it's all right&mdash;Course I
was born only about six miles from his birthplace&mdash;and maybe I
didn't tell that to everybody in Florida!"</p>

<p>"Come on. Perhaps he'll go out with us for a drink."</p>

<p>"Don't you dare ask him! Prob'ly everybody from Minnesota and
points west comes in and bothers him. Come on! I don't think we
ought to go see him, but hurry or we might miss him!"<br>
<br></p>

<p>It was all traditional and right: the secret alley beside the
theater, the stooped and hidden stage door, the doorman aged and
Irish and misanthropic.</p>

<p>"To, uh, to see Mr. Nord. Mr. and Mrs. Timberlane," Cass
submitted.</p>

<p>"<i>Judge</i> Timberlane," said Jinny.</p>

<p>But when they were admitted to the star's dressing-room, it was
such a littered coop, and the star, wiping off greasepaint, was
just Ole Ice Berg Nord. He looked at Cass a little puzzled.</p>

<p>"You're one of the Grand Republic Timberlanes, aren't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my mother was Marah Nord. I'm sort of a second cousin of
yours. I'm a lawyer."</p>

<p>"Oh, now I have it straight." Nord, a thick, undistinguished
figure in a blazing silk dressing-gown, was cordial.
"Cass&mdash;isn't that the name? Mighty pleased you came back,
Cass. Enjoy my show?"</p>

<p>"We thought it was magnificent." Nord was obviously pleased.
"Berg, this is my wife. Just married last year."</p>

<p>"Delighted to see you, Mrs. Timberlane. This your first visit to
New York?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it's my first."</p>

<p>"You enjoying your visit?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, so much. Well. That is. I don't know as I'd want to
live here. We're fond of Minnesota."</p>

<p>"So am I, Mrs.&mdash;uh&mdash;Timberlane"</p>

<p>Jinny must have seen in Cass's pleased and honest face the
prohibited come-out-and-have-a-drink look. Firmly taking her
husband's arm, she stated, "It's been a great honor to be able to
visit with you, and we must go now. Good night."</p>

<p>And went.</p>

<p>They stopped in the street and shone at each other.</p>

<p>Cass said proudly, "Nice fellow, isn't he!"</p>

<p>"Marvelous."</p>

<p>"Course off the stage, he seems like anybody else."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, I don't think so! I can feel the tremendous reserved
power in him. Oh, I could go for him in a big way!"</p>

<p>"Ye-es."</p>

<p>"Let's stop and get a drink some place&mdash;a quiet place, if
there is one in this town&mdash;and then go to bed. Oh, Cass, I'm
so tired, all that shopping&mdash;but is that plum-colored dress a
vision! We certainly have one thing to boast of: we didn't try and
wheedle poor Berg into going out with us."</p>

<p>"It might have been courteous to have asked him&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, you can't ask people like that."<br>
<br></p>

<p>Berg Nord was meditating, "I wish I'd asked those people out for
a drink&mdash;or they'd asked me. They made me quite homesick. I'd
like to hear the Grand Republic news. But they're probably busy on
their stay here. I wouldn't want to intrude."</p>

<p>In her own twin bed a little later, talkative and not sleepy,
Jinny mused aloud, "Think of how brilliantly he must talk when he's
with his real friends."</p>

<p>At Sardi's, Berg Nord was saying to his agent, who was one of
his three close friends, "I don't want to be a hog about it, but
you tell Hollywood I won't even look at less than two hundred
thousand. Know what I'm going to do, some day? Move back to
Minnesota and stay there. You New Yorkers are a pain in the neck.
Always thinking about money...I'll have another Scotch
old-fashioned."<br>
<br></p>

<p>Their lunch, on Wednesday, with Dennis Thane started jubilantly
with recollections of law school, each of which began, "Say, do you
remember the time I..."</p>

<p>Thane was effusive to Jinny.</p>

<p>"Is this your first visit to New York, Mrs. Timberlane?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it's the first time."</p>

<p>"Are you enjoying your visit here?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, very much, thank you."</p>

<p>But after that the luncheon was less vivacious.</p>

<p>So they did more shopping and went to museums, thousands of
museums, and went to a news-reel.</p>

<p>"Let's take a chance and dine at Twenty-One or the Algonquin or
one of those famous places, Jin."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know. They're fascinating, but they scare me, Cass.
Why don't we just have dinner here at the hotel, where they know
who we are, and then take in another movie and go to bed? There's a
bang-up movie opened on Broadway last night. I know it's good
because it was in Grand Republic two weeks ago, and Mrs. Higbee
said it was swell. Would that be okay by you?"</p>

<p>"Certainly would. I never care for more than just so much
horsing around. I thought eight days would be too short a stay
here, and New York does wake you up and give you a lot of ideas,
but I'll be kind of glad when we get away next Tuesday. I've
enjoyed every second of it, but I won't be sorry to be home and
shoot some golf with Roy."</p>

<p>"And I'm crazy to see how much the decorators have got done. Oh,
yes, I'm <i>very</i> glad we're staying till Tuesday, but that will
be about enough."<br>
<br></p>

<p>A Thursday filled with trying on dresses, trying on museums, and
churches, and deciding that their feet were too sore to go up and
look at Grant's tomb and the Rockefeller church, those appropriate
neighbors. The day was magnificently crowned by having dinner with
Avis Elderman, Bradd Criley's emigree sister.</p>

<p>She remembered Cass perfectly, and forgave him for it.</p>

<p>She had glittering jet on her bosom, and she took them to the
Colony Restaurant.</p>

<p>She said to Jinny, "I don't think I ever met you in Grand
Republic."</p>

<p>"No, I lived in Pioneer Falls as a kid."</p>

<p>"Oh!"</p>

<p>It took Avis a minute to swallow this, but she tried again:</p>

<p>"Is this your first glimpse of New York?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my first."</p>

<p>"I trust that you are enjoying your stay here."</p>

<p>"M."</p>

<p>"Mr. Elderman and I are sorry that you are making such a brief
sojourn. We had hoped to entertain you in our home. In Darien. In
Connecticut, you know. Though of course we practically live in New
York City&mdash;my husband's office is here, map-manufacturing, and
I come in and join him for an evening at <i>least</i> once a
fortnight, but still, we always say, even the city hasn't a more
exacting and delightful social life than Darien. You would enjoy it
so much."</p>

<p>"I'm sure of it," said Jinny.</p>

<p>As Cass and she went to bed, Jinny snarled, "The very next time,
I'm going to say, 'No. Is it <i>your</i> first visit?'"</p>

<p>And, after more meditation, "I thought Bradd was a lovely man,
till I met his sister."<br>
<br></p>

<p>When they awoke to devouring rain on Friday morning, Cass
rejoiced, "Would I be a barbarian if I said, 'Thank God, we don't
have to go out and look at the glories of New York all day
long'?"</p>

<p>"Me too!"</p>

<p>He thought, he telephoned down to the porter's desk, and
presently he announced, "I find we can get reservations for the
trip back home for Monday instead of Tuesday. What would
you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Darling! Swell! Grab 'em! I'm crazy to see the new house, and
Cleo and Rose and Valerie and Roy and everybody!"</p>

<p>They went back to sleep, lying close together, comfortably and
quietly. They breakfasted luxuriously, for the Melchester did
unexpectedly run to English muffins and wild-strawberry jam. They
got rid of the breakfast wreckage, and told the chambermaid to stay
out till lunch-time. Free from the duties of sightseeing, they
laughed as pointlessly as schoolchildren.</p>

<p>&mdash;Well, if this trip hasn't accomplished anything else,
it's got rid of Jay Laverick, and brought her back to me.</p>

<p>They were normally a somewhat restrained couple, but today they
reveled in the cheerful vulgarities of the bathroom. She scrubbed
his back, in the tub, and laughed, and kissed the wet smoothness of
his shoulder. He reached up his arms to encircle her with a sudden
need of her, and her giggling died in a passionate quick
breathing.</p>

<p>It was on that day of gaiety and benevolent bad weather that
their baby was conceived.</p>

<p>"There couldn't be a more wonderful lover than you," she
sighed.</p>

<p>They did admit the chambermaid&mdash;who looked at them
suspiciously&mdash; but they did not dress till five in the
afternoon, when the weather had cleared.</p>

<p>They had a small walk up Fifth Avenue. While they were out, Berg
Nord tried to telephone them. He had their address from Avis
Elderman (whom he hated). Nord had hoped to have them join him
after the theater, but he did not leave his name. They never
learned that he was a lonely man.</p>

<p>They came back to the dreariness of having to decide which urban
delight they would work at that evening.</p>

<p>The telephone. Cass answered. "Yes? Timberlane speaking." Then
he shouted.</p>

<p>"Jinny! Do you know who it is? It's Bradd Criley! He's just
landed here in New York, and he's right here in the hotel, and
he'll be up here in five minutes!"</p>

<p>She sang, "That's the most beautiful thing that ever happened to
me in my life!"<br>
<br></p>

<p>As Bradd came in, like a fresh wind from the Sorshay uplands,
Cass thought that Berg Nord might be a sturdy trial lawyer, and
Bradd, with that wavy hair that provides its own vine leaves, that
round pale face and automatic smile, might be a romantic actor. But
he got no further with the study, so excited were they all three,
two men and a girl, the trinity of friendship&mdash;and of
danger.</p>

<p>"You're the best sight for sore eyes I've seen since we left
home," said Cass.</p>

<p>"You two look pretty good to me. What about you, Jin? Are you as
glad to see me as your old man makes out he is?"</p>

<p>"My favorite brother, Bradd!" glowed Jinny, and kissed him.</p>

<p>Bradd summed it up, presently. "You have till Monday
then&mdash;tonight and all day Saturday and Sunday? Can't we all
play around together? I'm here for the Wargates, but I don't have
to do a thing till Monday morning, except a few telephone
calls."</p>

<p>"Perfect!" said Jinny.</p>

<p>"I really came on a couple of days early, hoping to catch you
two."</p>

<p>"Oh, Bradd, you didn't!" whispered Jinny.</p>

<p>"What's your plans for tonight?"</p>

<p>"Not a thing."</p>

<p>"Managed to see Life with Father yet?"</p>

<p>"Impossible to get tickets."</p>

<p>Bradd crowed, "Not impossible for <i>me</i> to get tickets! It's
a cinch, if you know the ropes. And I know every strand of the
little ole ropes in this man's town."</p>

<p>"I'll bet you do," worshiped Jinny.</p>

<p>Bradd was already telephoning. "Berbetz?...This is Criley, from
Grand Republic...Fine. Just got in. Now listens my young friend. I
want three for Life with Father for tonight, and I want good ones,
get me?...Fine. I'll pick 'em up at the box-office. I'll be seeing
you."</p>

<p>Jinny was looking at him with admiration.</p>

<p>He ordered briskly, "Now I'll run down and have a quick shower
and be ready in half an hour. Let's have an early dinner and have
plenty of time to talk. We'll go to the Algonquin or the Plaza, and
then after the show, I'll take you to Twenty-One or the Stork Club.
Been to any of those places?"</p>

<p>Cass sighed, "We tried the Marmoset, but we felt like a couple
of outsiders."</p>

<p>"You won't with me. They know me! I'll be seeing you."</p>

<p>When he was gone, Jinny triumphed, "Now we'll have a tremendous
time. But&mdash;I adore Bradd, but he is kind of a faker, isn't
he!"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"About this hotel being so out of the world. About getting these
tickets that you can't get. The way he does it, he just pays some
speculator about three times what they're worth. And about being
such a sweetheart to all the night-clubs. It's just going there
often enough, and tipping more than enough. The wise guy&mdash;the
great man about town! Why, you're twice as distinguished as he is,
and you look it!"</p>

<p>"Oh, now, Jinny, you're dead wrong. He isn't a faker."</p>

<p>"A show-off, then."</p>

<p>"But he isn't! Now, Jinny! I see him in the court room. He likes
to make a jury laugh, but there isn't a steadier or better-prepared
advocate in the district, and same way with his approach to his
friends. He has the heart of a boy, and it pleases him so when he
can do things for you that he just bubbles over. You've got to like
Bradd!"</p>

<p>"Oh, I do, lots. I just meant&mdash;It irritates me if anybody
thinks we're hicks just because we don't spend all our time doing
New York&mdash;on a Wargate expense-account!"</p>

<p>"Don't let his fun and high spirits fool you. You'll come to
love him."</p>

<p>"Anything for peace," she said. "All right, I'll love him
then."</p>

<p>"Good!" said Cass.<br>
<br></p>

<p>At the Algonquin, Bradd pointed out one timid drama critic, one
savage playwright, and two bored actors. Then they settled clown to
the news from Grand Republic...Harley Bozard had been seen at
Austin with a handsome woman from Minneapolis. Major Umbaugh had
been promoted to lieutenant-colonel. Jamie Wargate was now a
flyer.</p>

<p>Then Bradd spoke seriously.</p>

<p>"New York seems to have brought you two even closer together.
Jin, I'm glad you've got the Jay Laverick nonsense out of your
system."</p>

<p>"I never had any in it!"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, you did! Jay's an attractive heel, and a good friend
of mine, but I wouldn't trust him across the street with a deaf
virgin aged seventy. He does the sympathy racket. Listen, young
lady: Cass never would jump you properly about Jay, because he's a
sensitive gent, Cass is, and he's afraid of you. I'm not. So&mdash;
just how strongly did Mr. Jay express his ambition to make
you?"</p>

<p>Cass was surprised that he was not indignant at this intrusion,
and Jinny merely sputtered, "He never expressed anything of the
kind! I wouldn't let him!"</p>

<p>"You couldn't help letting him. Didn't he ever say
anything&mdash;very whimsy and make-believe, the little
darling!&mdash;about you and him starting an arty tea-room
together&mdash;he put up the cash and you the good taste?"</p>

<p>"Ye-es, he did make some cracks about my talent for
watercress."</p>

<p>"That's his standard line. I know you have too much sense to
fall for him really, but still, you did let him stick around, and
you better cut him out and cleave only to the dumb breadwinners
like the Judge and me. We won't let you down. Now you can tell me
how I've been butting in."</p>

<p>"Well, you have! And I won't be bullied!"</p>

<p>"Tut!"</p>

<p>"I'll fall for whom I like. I'm a free woman."</p>

<p>"That's what you think."</p>

<p>"Oh, you make me tired," she said, so feebly that Cass and Bradd
smiled at each other, and presently she was smiling with them.<br>
<br></p>

<p>If Cass found it too breathless, Jinny was exhilarated by the
different New York that Bradd disclosed to them. He took them to
three night-clubs, in which he was cordially greeted by, if not
with, fatted calves, and on top of that, he injected them, at one
o'clock in the morning, into a pent-house party being given by a
man who, Bradd explained, was a very important, high-class man,
with a lot of influence in Washington, the representative of a
chain of Western banks.</p>

<p>Jinny decided that, after all, she had been born to pent-house
life; to the glass bar and the Dali drawings and the couch long
enough to seat eight people, to the garden outside and the nervous
lights in the skyscrapers that formed its mountainous horizon; born
to the attentions of gallantly drunken gentlemen.</p>

<p>Thousands of men were telling Jinny that she was beautiful;
thousands and tens of thousands of ageless women were shrieking
that she must have another drink immediately, till the coils of
people inside the pent-house seemed thicker and darker than the
coils of cigarette-smoke. Suddenly even the gregarious Jinny could
not endure the blare of voices, and she slipped out on the
terrace.</p>

<p>So she beheld a New York new-born and celestial. She was
astonished to come out not to a light-pointed darkness but to the
rising sun. Four hours had gone in four minutes.</p>

<p>The pent-house was thirty stories up, on an apartment-house on
Central Park West, looking eastward to Fifth Avenue and the park.
To the northeast, incomprehensible waterways led through a golden
mist to the open sea of Long Island Sound, and over them the
bridges arched and vanished in a smudge of factories and airfields.
The bulky castles of Fifth Avenue and beyond seemed but a narrow
strip of gold-touched black floating upon the waters, and for a
moment the ponderous city was as graceful as Venice.</p>

<p>To southward a thousand towers reached toward the sun, while
just at her feet, far down, Central Park was still a dawn-dark
labyrinth, with the reservoir like one of her own Northern
lakes.</p>

<p>At her shoulder, Bradd's voice murmured, "New York can be
beautiful, eh? It's London and Paris and San Francisco all in
one."</p>

<p>"Yes, I didn't know how beautiful till you showed it to me,
Bradd. I was scared of it, but I think I could love it."</p>

<p>He kissed her, and in gratitude she responded recklessly. Bradd
drew back. "We didn't mean that! It was just an accidental salute
to the sun. Don't you ever tell that priggish Grand Republic lawyer
about it."</p>

<p>"Cass is <i>not</i> a prig&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I didn't mean him. I meant that&mdash;what's his name? Bradd
Criley? The fellow who thinks you're his sister. Are you?"</p>

<p>"Yes!"</p>

<p>Elbows on the parapet, they were talking quietly when Cass came
out to find them. He was pleased when he saw their fresh,
dawn-cooled faces.</p>

<p>"You two are the only people here that look as if you've ever
slept, but as it's tomorrow now, how about thinking of going home?"
he chuckled.</p>

<p>"Fine!" said the artless Bradd.<br>
<br></p>

<p>On Saturday and Sunday, Bradd was the most conscientious
pleasure-giver since Dennis the hangman. He took them to two
theaters, for a drive in a victoria in Central Park. On Sixth
Avenue he bought a dozen of the marzipan cakes that Jinny loved
even more than candy, and they three walked down the street boldly
eating them out of a paper bag. Sunday, they drove to Jones Beach
and on to a restaurant with tables on the terrace.</p>

<p>By now, Jinny considered New York just as good as Grand
Republic. But not Cass.</p>

<p>Bradd paid his share of all the bills, but he did not show off
by trying to pay more. In all their arguments he took Cass's side
against Jinny or Jinny's side against Cass, with equal
cheerfulness. And he bought for her the first orchid of which she
was ever the proprietor.</p>

<p>She confided to Cass, "You were entirely right about Bradd. He
wasn't trying to impress us about how well he knows New York. He
just has a lot of fun exploring it, and he loves to have his
friends share it."</p>

<p>When Bradd had seen them off on the train, on Monday, Cass said
to her, "Now you really begin to appreciate Bradd."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;thanks to you."</p>

<p>They returned to Grand Republic; they moved into the new house;
the fall term of court opened; and the first case over which Cass
presided was the divorce-suit of Beecher Filligan against his wife
Pasadena, with Mr. Jay Laverick warmly referred to in the
testimony.<br>
<br></p>

<p><b>An Assemblage of Husbands and Wives</b>
</p>

<p><i>Filligan vs. Laverick</i>
</p>

<p>Beecher Filligan had only a minority share in the ownership of
Havock &amp; Filligan, contractors, but he also played at
architecture and he had inherited a brickyard and a cement works.
In the peerage of Grand Republic he rated as a viscount, with the
highest distinction in the playing of backgammon. He was forty, and
a friend of Bradd Criley and Jay Laverick.</p>

<p>His wife Pasadena, born in that Oxford of the Pacific Coast, was
probably beautiful. She looked like a poor color-reproduction of a
Botticelli goddess of rather late spring. She was derivative in
everything except her make-up, in which she showed talent, care,
and diligence.</p>

<p>Beecher was sick of her, sick of her mildly clattering tongue,
her extravagance, and her monotony in bed. He wanted to get rid of
her, and since he had no legal reasons, he set about creating
them.</p>

<p>He knew that, despite her cow-like amiability when she had
everything she wanted, she could be shrill and stubborn if she
thought she was being cheated, so the fault had to be seemingly
hers, and his the forgiveness or the vengeance.</p>

<p>Jay Laverick took notice of every halfway-pretty woman who
seemed obtainable, and Beecher saw to it that Pasadena should
appear extremely obtainable.</p>

<p>She was a Talking Woman, and like most Talking Women she was too
busy babbling to notice what was happening about her. Her telephone
calls, to announce that she would come and play bridge next
Thursday, took half an hour. By going out to the kitchen and being
orally helpful, she could get any cook to quit during the first
fortnight, and Beecher usually went to sleep to her inane
discussion of something that would have happened if it had only
happened.</p>

<p>Beecher was not utterly to be blamed for his cold plotting
against her. His plan had started one evening when, after he had
complained absently about her extravagance and her astonishing
tendency to get accidentally kissed at country-club dances, she had
sneered, "Well, if I'm so lousy, why don't you <i>do</i> something,
and not just yap about it?"</p>

<p>Not till two years later, when she was already married to the
reluctant Jay Laverick, did she realize that Beecher had done
something.</p>

<p>Beecher, in the oldest and simplest of tricks, began his work by
having Jay at the house for three-handed rummy and being called out
to the cement works at ten P.M., then telephoning at eleven that he
would not be able to return till two. Venus and Freud did the
rest.</p>

<p>Beecher's careful labor was almost ruined by Jay's getting
interested in a much prettier and livelier woman, young Jinny
Timberlane, so he had Jay for house-guest at his summer camp on
Lake Winnemapaug, was called away "for two days," and returned late
that same night. He despised Jay for an amateur Don Juan when he
found them both in her bed, and asleep.</p>

<p>He said to Jay, "I ought to kill you, and I do happen to have a
loaded rifle here, but I think the only decent, civilized way out
of this horrible mess that you two have dragged me into is for you
to marry her as soon as I divorce her."</p>

<p>Jay said, Why certainly; that's what he had intended to do, all
along.</p>

<p>Pasadena, with her rouge smeared, was very distasteful to
Jay.</p>

<p>Later, in chambers, Pasadena reported to judge Timberlane,
"Beecher practically cried over all that he had tried to do for me,
and I just despised him. After that, I was sure I wanted to marry
Jay, who is a real man, not a whiner. But I will say for Beecher
that he did manage to make me feel like considerable of a
heel."</p>

<p>She was distasteful to Judge Timberlane in any state of make-up.
He said, "But, Pas, any husband must sense it at once if his wife
even begins to stray, and what I don't understand is how either you
or your husband could be taken in by such an obvious wolf as
Laverick."</p>

<p>"Don't you dare say anything against Jay! He's a gentleman, even
when he's drunk, and he's going to marry me."</p>

<p>He was, and he did.</p>

<h2>Chapter 34</h2>

<p>The Timberlanes had been married for a year now, and they were
fondly accustomed to the new house, to the gray furniture and
mulberry carpets and curtains, the yellow leather pouf, the
fireplace set flush in mirrors, in the pert living-room, as
arranged by Jinny. Isis was presumably happy on a teakwood pedestal
on a small glass shelf. The pictures were mostly nameless flower
pieces; there were tall portfolios of Impressionist painters; and
on a small flat desk were Jinny's precious tooled-leather stamp-box
and a useless yellow quill pen. It was all very gay and comfortable
and contemporary, even if it was a little like a model room in an
expensive furniture store.</p>

<p>Cass thought highly of the oil furnace and the electric
washing-machine, though he was not altogether contented in his new
study. It was a cigar-box of a room, handsomely paneled, with a
small fireplace reluctantly let into the pine walls, but there was
room for only a quarter of his books, and the rest were lost in
dark hallway-bookcases and the pinched attic.</p>

<p>"Oh, well, most of 'em I only look at once in a while, anyway,"
he sighed, as he lugged them to the attic. Strange that so few
books can require so many staggering struggles up the ill-lighted
stairs.</p>

<p>Jinny was joyfully busy. Now that she could organize her own
house, and Mrs. Higbee could no longer hide spices and Canadian
bacon and corn-flour from her in cavernous unknown cupboards, she
was an exemplary housewife, busy with errands to the new Byzantine
meat-market and the new Cordovan grocery-store, which made up the
business-center of the Country Club District. She went on
entertaining soldiers at the canteen, and once she stood on the
running-board of a car on Chippewa Avenue and made a speech for the
sale of war bonds.</p>

<p>"No," said Cass, afterward, "no, you were a very good speaker. I
wish most lawyers would sum up as clearly as you did. Sweetheart,
you're beating me at oratory as you do at everything else. Except
maybe chess."</p>

<p>She was unquestionably beating him at one thing. She was
pregnant.</p>

<p>He was delighted.<br>
<br></p>

<p>It was she who insisted that they must be economical, after the
New York journey and buying the new house, now that Owen or Emily
was coming.</p>

<p>She had picked out this choice of names for the baby, without
discussion. She explained it to Cass:</p>

<p>"I'm glad about the infant. I feel like looking up at you as
languishingly as any Dickens heroine. This is real creation. I
guess a baby is about the most modern and revolutionary thing a
girl can do. I intend to be a wonderful mother. I know that if it's
a boy, he'll be as sturdy and honest as you are, as your father
must have been, so I want him to be 'Owen,' after your father. And
if it's a girl&mdash;I had an Aunt Emily&mdash;so gentle, but awful
smart.</p>

<p>"I did think, 'way back six months ago, when I was young, that
I'd like to have a daughter named 'Lark.' I knew it was kind of a
fancy name, but I want her to be what I always wanted to be and
never could&mdash;swift and clean and belonging to the upper air,
not touched with earth. Wait, wait now! Don't tell me a lark has to
come down and sleep on the earth after it's got done soloing. I
guess an expectant mother has a right to her own metaphor hasn't
she?</p>

<p>"But then I got to thinking about what her classmates would do
to the kid, with a name like that, so I said to her, 'All right,
you're going to be a sweet, simple Emily, and <i>like</i> it!'</p>

<p>"Cass, I am going to adore that baby!"<br>
<br></p>

<p>Cass said to Roy Drover, "She's so sort of serene and adjusted
now."</p>

<p>Roy Drover said to Cass, "You mean she's got some of the damn
nonsense knocked out of her by morning sickness."</p>

<p>Bradd Criley said to Cass, in Jinny's active presence, "Our girl
is more lovely than ever now. How I envy you two!"</p>

<p>Chris Grau said to Jinny, with Cass philanthropically listening,
"How I envy you, dear! Did you ever know that once I thought I was
a little in love with your dear husband, myself? Oh, Jinny, you
must give him a lovely baby."</p>

<p>Mrs. John William Prutt said to Mr. John William Prutt who, in a
gray flannel union-suit, was sitting on the floor, cutting his long
pale toenails, "It is perhaps my imagination, but I cannot help
feeling that it may have been our influence as their former
neighbors that has changed Mrs. Timberlane from a really quite
scatterbrained and, I might almost venture to suggest, flirtatious
young woman into an apparently responsible young Grand Republic
matron."</p>

<p>Boone Havock, the distinguished ex-saloon-bouncer, said to Judge
Blackstaff, at the Federal Club, "Cass must of gone plumb crazy.
Probably from working too hard at loving that hot little wife of
his. Not that it's her fault, poor kid. I thought at first that she
was from the wrong side of the railroad tracks, but she seems to
have settled down to being a nice little lady and a good war
worker. But Cass&mdash;why, I hear where, right in this classy new
house of his, he entertained this flannel-mouthed Vogel, the county
agricultural agent, that's a Farmer-Laborite and practically an
under-cover gumshoer for the co-operatives that want to ruin every
decent business that we've given our lives to building up."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no, Boone," insisted Judge Blackstaff. "I find Judge
Timberlane a sound and loyal colleague. I think it's just that his
wife&mdash;after all, the is young, and she probably enjoys
experimentation and wants to meet all these cranks and freaks and
reds and fanatics, just to see what they're like. Once she has had
her baby, she'll settle down and be just like your wife and
mine.</p>

<p>"I certainly hope so," said Boone.<br>
<br></p>

<p>For Eino Roskinen, who was serving somewhere in the Pacific,
Cass and Jimmy packed a Christmas box: fruit cake, candy,
cigarettes, and a thin-paper edition of Farewell to Arms.</p>

<p>"We do so little and he does so much. I feel we ought to both be
out there with him," fretted Cass. "I'm going to kiss you for
<i>him</i>." That kiss was strange and disembodied, as though it
were indeed the caress of a spirit.</p>

<p>On this, their second Christmas together, everybody decided that
the Little Mother&mdash;as they all called her, to Jinny's
fury&mdash;ought to stay home and be visited and relentlessly loved
and cherished, and they all did it: the Drovers, Havocks,
Blackstaffs, Flaatens, Gadds, and an alternately shrieking and
hush-hushing gang of half a dozen more families, while for
Christmas dinner, with much holly and silver, there were Bradd,
Chris, Cleo, and the three Pennlosses. George Hame diffidently
brought in a pair of woolly mittens, embroidered for Jinny by his
daughter Betty, and a family whose son they believed Judge
Timberlane to have saved from prison sent a goose from Four Mile
Pine.</p>

<p>Jinny announced that she was now domesticated and contentedly
settled for her whole future life.<br>
<br></p>

<p>Drowsy with Christmas turkey and claret, Cass and Jinny and
Bradd, the others gone, hunched down in their deep chairs. Every
five minutes one of them said, "We ought to take a good brisk
walk." Busy as a squirrel, Jinny ate a chocolate, sipped
Benedictine, gulped a glass of water. She complained, "I have the
most awful thirst."</p>

<p>"Of course, you baby, eating all that sweet stuff," yawned
Bradd.</p>

<p>"Let's see if we can catch the Philharmonic on the radio and
then go out and take a good brisk walk," said Cass.</p>

<p>But first on Station <i>kich</i> came the war-news bulletins, to
which they listened with the indifference into which civilians
fall. But they sat up as they heard a bulletin:</p>

<p>"I have to announce the sad news that another of our boys has
given his life that democracy may live. One of our fine young men,
an expert on dairying processes, Eino Roskinen, was killed in an
airplane crash somewhere in the Pacific on Christmas Eve."</p>

<p>Bradd said quite cheerfully, "Didn't you know him, Jin?"</p>

<p>She gasped, and they half heard her groan, "I hardly let him
kiss me. I wish to God I had!"</p>

<p>Bradd stirred with electrified interest. Cass was filled with
pity. He went over to touch her hair, muttering, "A brave boy." He
felt struggling far down in him the rebellious thought, "How do I
know I wouldn't have been just as brave, if it had been my job to
fight?" But the thought never came to the surface, as she mourned,
cheek against his sleeve:</p>

<p>"We never think that death can come near <i>us</i>. But I feel
as if it were in the room now."</p>

<p>In the silence, they breathed uncomfortably. They could hear the
cat as it leaped from a cupboard toward the mantelpiece. It almost
missed and, clawing, upset the bracket on which was Isis, who
toppled from her little teak standard and fell to the tiled hearth,
with a tiny noise of breaking. Jinny hastened across the room and
picked up the crystal cat-goddess. One of its miniscule legs was
broken clean off, and Jinny held it out for Cass to see, sobbing
like a bewildered child.</p>

<h2>Chapter 35</h2>

<p>Cass had intended to keep their life from falling into a
prosperous-middle-class routine which would bore Jinny as it bored
his sister Rose, but now, he felt, "just for a while, a Certain
Amount of Routine will protect her."</p>

<p>He was correct in calculating that their routine did add up to
at least a Certain Amount.</p>

<p>The routine of his court room, workmanlike and busy, and the
routine of his return home, the welcoming kiss, the "What you been
doing all day?", news on the radio and reading&mdash;sometimes
aloud&mdash;of the Banner editorials, the game of chess, the game
of dominoes, the game of gin-rummy.</p>

<p>The routine of bedtime and Cass's "Golly, I didn't know it was
so late&mdash;guess it's about time to turn in," and in the
morning, "Almost eight o'clock&mdash;time to rise and shine."</p>

<p>The routine of food: steak, chicken, veal chops, corned beef,
pork chops, fried pike, steak; and of reports about the weather.
The routine discussion of shall we have soup? He was pro-soup, and
she was anti.</p>

<p>The routine of dining with the Pennlosses every Sunday noon.</p>

<p>The routine of love-making, which became a routine and not a
storm as soon as they wondered how much longer it was safe to
continue it.</p>

<p>But he knew that Jinny was no amateur of such regularity, and he
pondered upon the production of mild and antiseptic amusements. The
best of these seemed to be the encouragement of the Pennlosses and
Bradd and Chris to come in whenever they could. Somehow, the busy
Bradd was able to "drop in" much oftener than the others.</p>

<p>He was such a safe, comfortable, cheerful friend to have about.
He was ready to play cards, to talk, to listen, to pat Cleo, to
admire Jinny's knitting and Cass's legal opinions, to tease Jinny
when she was petulant and Cass when he was irritable, and to bring
ice in for the highballs from the kitchen refrigerator. Bradd was a
singularly neat remover of ice-cubes, refiller of ice-trays, and
wiper of highball glasses, and he agreed with Jinny on the
necessity of using, always, the Chinese brass coasters under the
glasses, to protect the tables.</p>

<p>It was Bradd who affably took charge on the evening when Jay
Laverick came in to show off his new wife, Pasadena, and was drunk
enough to hint that there had been other ladies, quite recently,
who had craved his competent affections.</p>

<p>So Bradd became the tertium quid in the household: Cass's friend
and admirer, Mrs. Higbee's admirer and beau, Cleo's teacher of
protocol, and Jinny's brother. He was a combination of grandfather,
son, investment-counsel, assistant judge, trained nurse, thoughtful
patron, and pet dog.</p>

<p>Cass did not realize&mdash;surely Bradd could not have
realized&mdash;just how often he was there.</p>

<p>Cass would have said that Chris Grau appeared just as often,
because when Chris did come, you noticed it. In forty-five minutes
she would change from Cass's thwarted sweetheart to protector of
Jinny against Cass's gross passions to sweater-knitting friend.</p>

<p>Bradd also read aloud from a very imaginative little manual of
psycho-analysis. He kept begging Jinny not to be shocked by these
cases from real life.</p>

<p>She was not shocked. She was interested.</p>

<p>It was a comfort to Cass that on evenings when he had to go out
speech-making, to the Masons or the Montenegrins or the Mensheviks,
he could count on Bradd to entertain Jinny at home or take her to
the movies. Occasionally, when Cass was kept late in his chambers
and Bradd felt that poor Jinny might be dull, he drove her down to
the Unstable for a drink before dinner.</p>

<p>This, however, seemed to Cass unnecessary.<br>
<br></p>

<p>They had a serene evening, Cass and Jinny alone, discussing the
future of Owen-Emily.</p>

<p>"It excites me and it scares me," said Cass.
"He&mdash;she&mdash;will be able to fly from Grand Republic to
London in eight hours, and he may see the whole world one state, or
see it an anarchy starving in caves."</p>

<p>"Well, before he starts revolutionizing the world," mused Jinny
tenderly, "I'm going to see he's a good swimmer and tennis player,
and says 'Thank you, Mother' nicely."</p>

<p>"Reactionary!"</p>

<p>They were cheerful then, but when Cass came home the next
evening, he found a Jinny irritable as a cat-haunted robin.</p>

<p>"Why, what's the trouble, dear sweet?" he bumbled.</p>

<p>"Don't be so disgustingly forgiving and paternal!"</p>

<p>"All right, I'll be unforgiving. Go on."</p>

<p>"Oh, it's just&mdash;I went out to the Unstable for lunch with
Gillian Brown. She had an idea I might do some sketches for their
fashion show at the Beaux Arts. And maybe I will, too. And&mdash;I
hadn't meant to take a drink, but I felt so blue, shut in here all
the time&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You aren't!"</p>

<p>"Yes I am too! I don't know as it can be helped, but I am. And I
had this mean thirst that's been bothering me lately&mdash;I
suppose that's pregnancy, too&mdash;and so I had a highball, and I
felt better. And Bradd just happened to drop in, and he came over
and joined us, and he felt like taking the afternoon off, and so he
and Gillian decided they'd go to Alimony Hall and get drunk, and
they asked me would I like to come along, and I said, Yes, I
certainly would&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You know&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, yes, yes, I know <i>exactly</i> what you think of
Alimony Hall and Sabine Grossenwahn, but there isn't any law in the
Constitution, is there, that I have to accept <i>all</i> your
opinions? Sabine is amusing, and if she sleeps with everybody in
town&mdash;except you&mdash; I <i>hope</i>&mdash;that isn't any of
our business, is it?"</p>

<p>"I rather think&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, don't talk like John William Prutt! Like Mrs. Prutt! Like
the whole world of Pruttery! That's how they felt about <i>us</i>,
one time. Sometimes often you're just as priggish as the Prutts. I
much prefer a roughneck realist like Boone Havock. <i>Or</i>
Sabine! But anyway: I wanted to go, but I knew you and Roy would
have a fit, so I said, No, I wouldn't. And so Bradd and Gillian
kidded the life out of me for being such a Puritan, and I think
they were right, too; I think I'd of felt a lot better if I had
gone and lapped up a lot of Sabine's Miracle Mash Bourbon. Roy is
crazy. He's just an old woman&mdash;like all
obstetricians&mdash;and he isn't even that&mdash;he's a surgeon. By
golly, if there were one in town, I'd get me a nice sympathetic
young obstetrician that would <i>prescribe</i> hell-raising! Now go
on. Be horrified. I guess it's very choice and high-class to have a
husband that can quote Milton and Veblen, but I get awful tired of
living in a diving-bell. So now you can be horrified all you want
to!"</p>

<p>"But I'm not, and as soon as Owen comes&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Emily!"</p>

<p>"Emily, then. Then I'll go to Sabine's with you."</p>

<p>If indeed he was "horrified," it was only that the trusty Bradd
should have been willing to take her to that amateur brothel.
Then:</p>

<p>&mdash;Oh, sure. I've got it. He didn't want her to go at all,
and he just pretended he did to gentle her down. Still, I would
like to ask Bradd what he really said.</p>

<p>But, worried over Jinny, worried by the war news, he forgot to
ask.<br>
<br></p>

<p>He reached home before Jinny, that evening in early March. He
sat in one of the detestably neat gray-leather chairs, bending his
newspaper. He heard her at the door. She did not halt to take off
her furs; she was in the doorway, her hands flat against either
side of the frame, her face wincing, no youthful wife but a
frightened woman.</p>

<p>He sprang up.</p>

<p>"Cass! I'm sick, I'm really sick, and it isn't just pregnancy. I
may die."</p>

<p>He held her arms, wet with melting snow.</p>

<p>"I've just been to Roy for my examination. Cass, I have
diabetes!"</p>

<p>"Oh, no!"</p>

<p>"Yes. And I could die from it."</p>

<p>"It's not serious, Jinny; it couldn't be!"</p>

<p>"Not <i>too</i> serious, Roy says. I don't even need insulin,
not yet anyway, he says; just proper diet and take care of myself.
But could anything be worse than taking care of yourself all the
time, like an invalid?"</p>

<p>"I'll do it for you."</p>

<p>"You will, O God, how you'll take care of me! It'll be worse
than dying. Wrapped in cotton, all night, all day&mdash;and
expected to be grateful!"</p>

<p>"Now, now! Let's get your coat off. Here, let me rub your hands.
Lord, they're cold! There, there&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Now, now, now! There, there, there!" she mocked him. "Sweet,
sweet chick! Enjoy your beddie-weddie all day long! You and Roy
will have me as sappy as Juliet Zago in a month!"</p>

<p>He had sense enough to ignore her sputtering. A girl had the
right to be a little testy at the threat of death! He yelled out to
Mrs. Higbee to delay dinner fifteen minutes, and to bring two
martinis, quick. He got Jinny settled on the couch, with Cleo soft
between them, and demanded, "Now tell me exactly."</p>

<p>"Maybe it isn't too bad. Roy says it's diabetes, all right, but
very mild&mdash;says if I just have a little common sense&mdash;but
of course that's like saying, 'If you just have the genius of
Beethoven,'&mdash; and if I take care of myself, I could live to be
ninety and scarcely know I had the thing...And be just as
good-looking! I mean&mdash;you know&mdash;not ugly, I mean...But
doesn't it sound coarse. Diabetes! Sugar in the urine! Aah! Why
can't I die of something romantic, like Camille or Mary, Queen of
Scots? Diabetes!"</p>

<p>"Call it 'diabetes mellitus,' then. That sounds fancier."</p>

<p>"So it does. Oh, I do feel better, now I've told you, and I know
it will be wonderful, the way you'll take care of me. I'm not
really ungrateful. I'm just blaming on you the faulty action of my
Islands of Langerhans, blast 'em! I have some nerve back now. I
<i>will</i> live to be ninety&mdash;and you'll be a hundred and
four and still trying to get me to eat less candy&mdash;and I'll
crab all the time, and love you for it!"</p>

<p>But she was frightened. It quavered in all her flippancies, and
he concentrated on her fear, not on his own below-zero terror that
she might die and all his own life die with her.</p>

<p>As she hastily drank the cocktail he had ordered, he mused, "I
suppose Roy has forbidden all alcohol."</p>

<p>"Yes, this drink is my last. Say, how did you ever get as gloomy
a friend and physician as Roy? He doesn't even enjoy seeing his
patients die when they disobey him. Yeh, no alcohol, no candy, no
cake, very little meat. He wants to keep me alive only technically.
His theory is that it's better to be alive and miserable than dead
and happy. Not even one tender, confiding little cocktail."</p>

<p>"Well, this evening I'll also give you one stiff highball, and
starting tomorrow morning, we'll both of us go on the water-wagon,
absolutely. Both of us. You realize that?"</p>

<p>"O God, yes, I realize it. When the Judge raises his voice like
that, the boys run right out and get the rope."</p>

<p>"Darling, it won't be so bad. We'll have lots of pleasant
substitutes for sweets and booze."</p>

<p>"As how? <i>Chess?</i>"</p>

<p>"No, we'll think of a lot of things."</p>

<p>"Always ending with chess!"</p>

<p>"Now don't be so contrary."</p>

<p>"A girl that's going to die has got a right to be contrary."</p>

<p>"She certainly hasn't any right to say 'has got' for 'has,' and
if she claims all her rights and has a husband like me, who's too
weakly adoring to spank her and put her to bed, she's in danger of
having him become devious and control her by slyness instead of by
healthy bullying. You can't win, now that I've started to take care
of you, and I want no more pretty nonsense out of you."</p>

<p>"Gee, at that, you may be a better wife-manager than I
thought."</p>

<p>"I may. And by the way&mdash;You spoke of my court attendants
running for a rope. You know, don't you, that actually there is no
capital punishment in the State of Minnesota? What are you smiling
at, dear? Have I said something naive?"<br>
<br></p>

<p>During dinner, she was cheerful, and in her old voice of
affectionate derision she read the regimen that Dr. Drover had
given to her.</p>

<p>"Avoid worry...Doesn't say how; just avoid it&mdash;<i>you</i>
know&mdash; ole worry come, throw it out of the window. Gee, the
wonders of medical science...Warm clothes...Drop in at some
lumberjack store tomorrow and buy me a nice red-flannel union suit,
will you? That'll keep all the men away, and so I'll also avoid one
of the worries, anyway...Warm baths. Mm. Massage...That depends on
the masseur. Do you know any handsome young gentlemen masseurs?
They <i>could</i> be blind. I still think Jay Laverick would make a
fine, conscientious masseur, but I never could get a meeting of
minds with you on that topic...Diet...Me on a diet! Me that in my
prime tossed in banana splits and pickled pig's feet at the same
orgy...Saccharine for sugar...Cereals...Leafy vegetables...How I do
hate leafy vegetables&mdash;the leafier the nastier, I always say.
I hate to get my teeth into a mess of leaves...Beans, broccoli,
cabbage, cucumbers, endive, okra&mdash;okra!&mdash;squash,
tomatoes, turnip-tops, watercress&mdash;I ask you! Could anything
sound more loathsome? Just make sure that I stick to that diet for
two months, and I'll run away with Boone Havock and go reeling down
State Street with the fumes of two steaks and a mutton chop rising
to my befuddled brain...Oh, darling, can you stand making me stand
it?"</p>

<p>"Sure!"</p>

<h2>Chapter 36</h2>

<p>At the end dinner he coaxed, "Now I want you to skip right up
and get into bed, and I'll come up and talk to you, and we'll play
a good game of&mdash;of dominoes."</p>

<p>"Now you look here! I do not intend to start being an invalid,
in bed all the time. I'd rather die first! Roy didn't
say&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no, just tonight. You're overwrought. So am I, for that
matter. I'll talk to Roy about it, but I presume that ordinarily
you'll be able to stay up till ten-thirty or eleven every
evening&mdash; maybe till midnight, after Baby comes."</p>

<p>"No, tonight especially <i>not</i>. If I relaxed, I'd be too
scared."</p>

<p>"Tell you what I'll do. I'll get some lively soul to come in and
gossip and cheer us both up. I'll get Bradd! He'll have to know,
sooner-later, anyway."</p>

<p>"Yes, you phone him, and I'll put on my most languorous
nightgown and receive all you boys in bed. Like a queen...Oh, Cass,
I was going to be such a good, strong wife, and I'm just a sick,
whining child, to bother you."</p>

<p>She sobbed, head against his substantial shoulder, for a long
time. When she went up the stairs, still whimpering softly, he
looked up after her, and her climbing was that of a naughty child
who has been punished.</p>

<p>He did not tell her afterward, but when he telephoned he did not
find it easy to capture Bradd. He had to drag him out of a poker
game. Bradd sounded not too willing, and Cass insisted that Jinny
was ill and really needed the skillful cheering of the
man-about-town.</p>

<p>When he went up to sit awkwardly by her bed, in the new
gray-and-pink chamber, he reflected that Bradd had never seen her
here, and he regretted having invited even his old friend into the
sanctuary. She was miraculously feminine tonight; the baby was
going to be tiny, and she was scarce swollen; there was no hint of
it as she sat up in bed, huddled under the pink silk coverlet. Her
throat was fair above sinful laces and ribbons, her hair was softly
shaken out, her cheeks were flushed, by nature as well as art.</p>

<p>&mdash;Um. That was a mistake. But too late now to stop
Bradd...And she really does need some clown like him, tonight...My
lovely, warm, terrified girl.</p>

<p>He fumbled, "Before Bradd comes, there's one slightly
embarrassing thing&mdash;I don't know whether Roy spoke of it or
not but I wonder&mdash; and of course we have to think of your
health beyond any other consideration&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You dear old lady! You wouldn't be chastely referring to
sleeping together, would you?"</p>

<p>"Why, Jinny!"</p>

<p>"I could use still more lucid expressions."</p>

<p>"Stop riding me, sweet. I can't help it if I'm shy with
you&mdash;call it reverent. There are a dozen or so words that Roy
and I used to exchange freely, at the age of twelve. I do know
them&mdash;you'd be surprised! But I honestly don't like to use 'em
in your presence."</p>

<p>"Didn't Bradd use 'em, too?"</p>

<p>"Not much. He was a foully clean-minded little
beast&mdash;then."</p>

<p>"Poor, innocent Bradd!"</p>

<p>"I'd like to get back to our investigation. What did Roy
say?"</p>

<p>"He said, situation normal for six weeks or so, and then we'll
have to be as chaste as my crystal cat."</p>

<p>They looked at each other so confidingly.<br>
<br></p>

<p>Their old friend Bradd had never been more admirable.</p>

<p>He came in casually; he lightly patted Cass's shoulder; he
kissed Jinny's cheek&mdash;not overly glancing, Cass noted, at her
bosom beneath the foam of nightgown; he sat down and took charge of
their muted terror.</p>

<p>"I had a hunch something was wrong, when you called me, Cass, so
I phoned Roy, and he says Jin has a very mild case of diabetes,
nothing to worry over. Jinny, sweet, our chief job is the agreeable
one of keeping you gay as a gopher. Now of course all these docs,
even a hardboiled one like Roy, croak about avoiding all alcohol
and sweets, and any mental flings more disturbing than buying
moth-balls. They exaggerate, because they hope to get <i>half</i>
of what they order&mdash;like a dealer telling you to keep a new
car down to thirty. If they tell a patient to cut out alcohol, what
they expect is that the dope will cut the intake down to a pint of
mule every six hours, with just a dash of canned heat.</p>

<p>"The great thing in curing any of these chronic diseases is
mental, so if Cass and you and I have just a couple of drinks and
sit around and laugh like fools, that'll be more sensible than
acting like a dyspeptic killjoy. How about it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm sure you're right, Bradd," rejoiced Jinny. "I'll be
careful, but not get sour and Pruttish."</p>

<p>"Look, you two!" protested Cass.</p>

<p>"Consider it said, sweetie," purred Jinny. "You mean that the
orthodox method of not drinking any alcohol whatever is not to
drink any alcohol. We young revolutionists don't fall for that any
longer. And, Cass, you <i>said</i> I could have another drink,
after dinner."</p>

<p>"Did I? Well, I think you're getting along fine without it, so
let's stick to that."</p>

<p>Bradd and Jinny looked with humorous exasperation at this
husbandly spoil-sport, but he was firm.<br>
<br></p>

<p>She refused to have a nurse, but she did, with omissions, "take
care of herself." To her the omissions were a joke, a game of
thwarting Cass and his co-plotter, Dr. Drover.</p>

<p>To Cass, nothing of all this was a joke. The shock of
comprehending her danger was a delayed contusion, and not till next
day did he quite take in the special fact of her illness. Then, all
day, on the bench, he was taut and shaky.</p>

<p>He was agonizingly aware that she might die. When he passed a
cemetery, cold under March snow, when he heard of the death of
another soldier from home, he starkly saw her then, unmoving in a
coffin, not to move and speak to him again, ever.</p>

<p>He had never rented Bergheim, and now he refused an offer. He
heard himself saying, "If she died, I would take Cleo and Mrs.
Higbee and crawl back to the old place."</p>

<p>His most desperate effort was to keep from seeming
desperate.<br>
<br></p>

<p>Jinny did not often leave the house, as April came roughly in,
promising May. She drove into the country sometimes with Cass or,
if he was held in court till evening, with Rose or the Wolkes, but
mostly she clung to the house, like the frightened cat with whom
Cass was always identifying her now.</p>

<p>Every night she conscientiously tended her feet, stooped over
them, bathing and rubbing every tiniest crease or abrasion, while
Cass watched her pitifully.</p>

<p>She recited hopefully, "Roy says the great Dr. Joslin says every
diabetic ought to have a dog, because a dog never tempts you to
break your diet or embarrasses you by being too sorry for you, like
your friends. 'Well,' I said to Roy, 'my cat is just as good as a
dog that way, isn't she?' and he said, very stiff, 'Joslin doesn't
say anything about cats&mdash;just dogs.'</p>

<p>"And Roy does lay such stress on the grapefruit. He figures a
grapefruit is the diabetic's best friend&mdash;next to his dog, of
course! I got to eat grapefruit and like it&mdash;that horrible,
fat, smug, sickly-yellow lump!</p>

<p>"And Roy says there's no danger Emily will transmit the tendency
to diabetes&mdash;or Owen either&mdash;if there's none of it in
<i>your</i> family, and he says there isn't any. Poor Emily! To
start off with a mother that hasn't got one doggone thing but love
for her&mdash;no strength and no candy and not much sense. You've
got to have sense for both of us, Cass.</p>

<p>"There. If Dr. Joslin himself came right in this room now and
looked at those feet, he'd say, 'Jinny, I never saw a slicker job
of pedicuring. You're a good girl, Jinny&mdash;for a blasted
diabetic!'"</p>

<p>"No! A blessed diabetic."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. And Roy said Joslin said Clemenceau and Edison were
both diabetics, and they carried on like sons-of-guns with it."</p>

<p>"So will you."</p>

<p>"But you don't think it will make me reactionary like them, do
you?"</p>

<p>"I don't think it will make you anything but Jinny."</p>

<p>"Which is rapidly being accepted by all lexicographers as a
symptom for perfection, you mean?"</p>

<p>He wanted to cry.<br>
<br></p>

<p>Sometimes she was little and bewildered and clung to Cass and
wanted to be obedient to Dr. Drover's orders. Sometimes she was
irritated by the unreasonableness of being ill and turned to Bradd,
who chirped, "Cheer up, baby; I'm sure you behave a lot better than
His Honor says."</p>

<p>Cass was supposed to be pleased when Bradd could inspire her to
a flippant lightness, but he wondered if they did not depend too
much on Bradd's friendly presence. Then, in May, the duty of being
comic in the sickroom was shared by a discharged Marine&mdash;that
radio-artistic Fred Nimbus who had once acted himself into the war.
Nimbus had an excellent record; he had risen to corporal and been
honorably discharged for a mild stomach ulcer. He had gone no
nearer to the South Pacific than San Diego, but he came home to his
creative labors at Station <i>kich</i> where, from his experiences
as a Marine Corps stenographer, he described to the Far-Flung Radio
Audience&mdash;flung at least as far as Kanabec County&mdash;the
fighting on tropical islands, the inside politics of China and
India, and the racial mixtures in the Balkans and Peru. He was to
be heard at the house of Gregory Marl, explaining everything so
vehemently that even Diantha Marl shut up.</p>

<p>There were other returned soldiers in town, but most of them had
been wounded and they were strangely unwilling to show off even for
such interrogatory civilians as Diantha, and Mr. Fred Nimbus was
their willing Homer.</p>

<p>He remembered that Mrs. Timberlane and he had been chums, and he
assumed that in her illness the one thing she longed for was his
manly and merry presence. He was often in the house now, forgiving
Jinny for having failed him, trying to forgive Cass for having
stolen her away, brightening them all up by interpreting the home
life of Hirohito.</p>

<p>Round Jinny's chaise-longue gathered, too, the Pennlosses and
Wolkes and Tracy Oleson. Cass was disturbed by the very gaiety that
kept her cheerful. He wanted, and did not want, to remind her that
she was ill, but only when morning sickness overwhelmed her, or dry
thirst and a series of itches revealed the lurking diabetes, did
she want to be quiet and somewhat less populated. She looked almost
too well in frail loveliness, an alabaster lamp.</p>

<p>He hinted, "Why don't you take up your drawing again? That would
give you something to do, and not tire you."</p>

<p>"I seem to have lost all ambition. I guess that even
up-and-coming young married women do get that way. It's not so much
that I'm ill. I'm trapped by happiness. I'm so very proud of
Owen."</p>

<p>"Not Emily?"</p>

<p>"No, it's Owen. He stirs quite differently from a
girl&mdash;more cranky. He'll be one of these men that will take
care of their wives even if it kills them!"</p>

<p>Cass was glad of his alliance with Bradd. When the living-room
was full of chatterers, Bradd looked at them malevolently, while
Jinny mocked, "Look at those old crape-hangers, Father Cass and
Uncle Bradd. You kids better be quiet. I don't dare peep. But I'd
like to get up and dance and have a great, big, thick, raw
hamburger and four cream-puffs. I am so hungry!"</p>

<p>But if Bradd disapproved of the young people as much as Cass, he
could step down into their ribaldry more easily, and Cass admired
the ease with which he could say, "We all better get out now and
give Jinny a chance to rest."</p>

<p>Cass begged of Jinny, "Do I bore you by asking Bradd to come in
so often?" and she consented, "Oh, no, I like him almost as well as
you do."</p>

<p>He kept from caressing her, for fear of his own wild
possessiveness. He perceived again that none of the spectacles of
the world, not the pride of war nor the pomp of religion nor
thrones and towers and banners, was so exalted or so tragic as that
love between men and women which had been greeted always with
trivial welcome or with shameful jesting.<br>
<br></p>

<p>She began to make a business of understanding that she was ill
and could not live on pity. He was proudest of her one late
afternoon when she reported, "I got out a little today&mdash;went
over to see Mrs. Purdwin. She's been having terrible
arthritis&mdash;she's in pain most of the time, awful wrenching
pain&mdash;it wakes her up. She says it's like a whip-lash; it just
takes all the humanity out of her and she becomes an animal.</p>

<p>"So then I quit being so sorry for myself. I'd been feeling as
if I were set aside from all normal people; as if I were a
condemned man, with no hope. But after I'd talked to Mrs. Purdwin I
got to thinking about people that are <i>really</i> up against it:
men without jobs in cities, farmers with mortgages and the crop has
failed again and the kids are hungry and cold; all the awful things
that we first-class passengers never know.</p>

<p>"So I decided you're not going to be afflicted any more by
having a whiner around. I'm so virtuous now, it hurts!</p>

<p>"But when I do slip and start whining again, you'll put up with
it, won't you?"</p>

<h2>Chapter 37</h2>

<p>Judge Timberlane, a sensible man, explained it lucidly to him
self on the train:</p>

<p>&mdash;You're only going to be gone five or six days at most,
and Roy is right there at hand, and Rose and Bradd will look in,
and Mrs. Higbee is better than any nurse. And if anything did go
wrong&mdash;but nothing could&mdash;how could <i>you</i> help?</p>

<p>&mdash;Just as well not to be around and mooning over her all
the time. Be reasonable. And don't keep telephoning her
long-distance every minute, either. When you get to your hotel,
can't you get settled first, and not phone her before you even take
off your hat?</p>

<p>He apparently could not.</p>

<p>Jinny said, No, nothing really critical had happened to her in
the three hours since he had left her.<br>
<br></p>

<p>He had been summoned to Duluth to give help with a crowded
court-calendar. Now, in April, the trees that embraced the city in
summer had not yet blossomed, but Lake Superior was free of ice,
with something like terror in its steel beauty. His hotel was just
above the lake, and all evening, his business in court finished,
idle and lonely and full of the lack of Jinny, he listened to the
sounds of the inland seaport. From his window, across the narrowed
end of the lake, he saw the "diamond necklace" of lights on the
Allouez ore-docks, and they filled him, the steamers' whistles
filled him, with divine restlessness.</p>

<p>Jinny and he must not stay forever in the inland ruts of Grand
Republic.</p>

<p>After two evenings of dining with fellow-judges and coming back
to the hotel to read briefs and try to think of important reasons
for telephoning to Jinny, his bachelor state seemed deplorable. He
was pleased when in the hotel coffee-shop he saw that enterprising
business woman, Mrs. Gillian Brown of Grand Republic, come to
Duluth on propaganda for that fine, clean-smelling, domestic
perfume, Mourir pour Amour, of which Harley Bozard was state
missionary.</p>

<p>She waved to him invitingly. He liked Gillian, and he moved to
her table.</p>

<p>She was in a fine ribald mood, and she also told Cass that he
was a graceful swimmer, which no one seemed to have noticed before.
They went to a motion picture, and Cass felt that he was expected
to slide his hand along Gillian's beautiful arm.</p>

<p>Well, he did and he didn't.</p>

<p>Gillian said cheerfully, "I've got some especially good Bourbon
in my suite at the hotel. Come up and have a drink."</p>

<p>In the full elevator, he was pressed against her. As they
entered her suite, she threw her coat at a chair, and looked at him
blandly. Her look said that she had always liked him more than he
had guessed, and that, poor man, he must be living in the most
undesirable chastity. All of her movements were swift and
efficient. She mixed two highballs, without spilling a drop, she
put them on the low table before the couch, without a bang, she
touched his arm and drew him down to a place beside her on the
couch. He knew that he was almost inevitably going to kiss her.</p>

<p>But she made one mistake. She said, "Let's have a drink, first,"
and gulped half her glass. As she set it down, she stared with
simple surprise and fury, for Cass had warily popped up from the
couch and was, in abject retreat, heading for his hat.</p>

<p>"W&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Gill, you're extremely attractive, and good night!"</p>

<p>All the way to his room he snarled, "All right, I <i>am</i> a
Puritan! I'm sure Gillian is much more sensible...Jinny!"<br>
<br></p>

<p>During the last month of Jinny's pregnancy, her mother came down
now and then from Pioneer Falls, but she was a remarkable
mother-in-law; she believed that it was her daughter that Cass had
married, not herself. She came in and looked approving and told
Cass that he was a fine man, a good husband, and went home.</p>

<p>Except for a tiny lesion on her left foot, over which Dr. Drover
croaked unbecomingly (she said), Jinny got through easily to her
time of confinement. She again refused a nurse.</p>

<p>"The woman would just butt in between you and me, and I want us
to be so close now, because I am kind of scared. I don't even want
Mother or Rose or Bradd around. Don't you dare try to duck out of
your responsibility of being my guardian angel!"</p>

<p>"I'll put on special wings."</p>

<p>"You better! And what's this nonsense about your going off to
what you call a 'court' every day? Is that kind? Is that necessary?
Do you really want to go on with this business of making people
unhappy just because they've acted naturally and killed people or
raped people or robbed people that were just asking to be killed
and raped and robbed? Doesn't your court sound pretty silly, when I
put it that way? No, you stay home with me."</p>

<p>He did, as far as he could.<br>
<br></p>

<p>That fair June evening, they sat out on the small screened
terrace at one end of the house, Jinny wrapped in a silken
coverlet.</p>

<p>"I don't mind much, but it does go <i>on</i> so!" was her only
complaint.</p>

<p>He coaxed her to sleep early by going off to bed himself. His
body ached with hers. Asleep, he dreamed that she was on a steamer
pulling out from the pier on which he stood, and he frantically
wanted to leap the growing gap. He came sharply awake at a wail
from her room. Not quite sure that he was not still dreaming, he
was standing beside her bed without seeming to have walked
there.</p>

<p>She smiled, but with a twitching tic in it. She wavered, "The
pains have started. Would you mind phoning Roy? What time is
it?"</p>

<p>"Just a second...Seventeen minutes to three."</p>

<p>"Emily is the most inconsiderate child!"</p>

<p>Nothing was real to him; everything was a fantasy in hard steel
colors, in the night chill. He had not believed that he could love
Jinny more, but love so filled him that he could in no way express
it. He stooped to kiss her fleetingly, and he stated baldly,
"Everything is in order. Relax now."</p>

<p>Roy Drover's voice, answering on the telephone, was
watchful.</p>

<p>Cass was dressed and back in her room in six minutes. She was
feebly flapping around with a girdle.</p>

<p>"Here, this is plenty wardrobe." He wrapped a quilt about her
and carried her downstairs to the car.</p>

<p>"But my clothes, my lovely new clothes that Mr. Timberlane
bought for me!" she sighed.</p>

<p>"I'll have Mrs. Higbee pack some and I'll bring 'em later." She
was almost asleep again, exhausted from the pains, as he lifted her
into the car, and she nuzzled against him with none of Jinny's
pertness.</p>

<p>Grand Republic was proud that its St. Agatha Hospital was as
tiled and shiny, as tricky in its surgical technique, as anything
in Chicago. But it was also as bureaucratic. The night desk-clerk,
a young lady whom the war had unfortunately lured from the farm,
had never heard of Mrs. Timberlane, Judge Timberlane, or
pre-engaged private rooms, and it is doubtful whether she had ever
heard of obstetrics, though she should have. While Jinny sat in the
lobby, a small bundle of acute pain hugely covered with comforters,
and Cass roared at the clerk, suddenly Dr. Drover made a stage
entrance, growled, "I'll take care of her," and lifted her up onto
a wheeled stretcher which he seemed to have slipped out of his
pocket.</p>

<p>Cass looked at Roy's placid, bulky power with reverence. This
was not the old friend; this was their god. That the doctor could
ever have done anything so lacking in cold divinity as sleeping and
snoring that night seemed impossible. He was the machine that
impersonally dealt out birth and death and relief from pain.</p>

<p>In a hygienic, hateful private room, he lifted Jinny to the high
bed. Against the meager hospital pillow her hair was stormily
black, but her face was thin and small, jerking with agony.</p>

<p>For more than an hour Cass stood clumsily about the room, in a
fire of terror. It was at dawn that Roy nodded to the nurse, with
"Take her in now." He did not even look at Cass, who was suddenly
doing a lockstep up and down the corridor, shut out from her pain.
Roy did so far recognize him as a human being as to come out of the
delivery-room and nod, but Cass knew that there was danger and
difficulty in there, beyond the smug glazed door.</p>

<p>He heard no wail of a new-born infant, no cheerful slapping of
its back, none of the traditional joys of childbirth. Roy came
rapidly stalking out, authoritative in white gown and mask,
followed by an orderly wheeling a stretcher, on which was just seen
the tiny unconscious face of Jinny among the covers, and the nurse
carrying an anonymous wrapped bundle.</p>

<p>Cass had pictured the baby lying beside the fond mother, and
Jinny awakening to love it. But the nurse took the bundle off to a
room down the hall.</p>

<p>"Girl," said Roy.</p>

<p>"How is Jinny? How is she? How is she?"</p>

<p>"Oh, she'll be okay. Got more stamina than you'd expect from
such a skinny kid. She'll be under anesthetic for a few minutes
yet. But the baby&mdash;Some trouble there; obstructed gut or
something, don't know what yet; not breathing the way I like. May
have to operate."</p>

<p>They stood on either side of Jinny's bed, and Cass cloudily
tried to associate that diminutive face with his radiant and
expansive girl. He felt that they were all in a dream, anxiously
doing unseen things in a valley of fog.</p>

<p>Roy was yawning, "I'll go take a look at the baby now. Say, see
last night's paper?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Those Japs are making us a lot of trouble. You know what I'd
do, if I was commanding the Navy? I'd just ignore all these
outlying islands and land right on Japan itself. I don't suppose
I'm any military and naval expert, but I bet I could do a lot
better job than most of these professionals. A surgeon is a fellow
that has got to get right down to brass tacks. Of course it's these
Roosevelt politics that are hampering&mdash;"</p>

<p>From the bed, the tiniest of protesting sounds: "Are you boys
going to go on talking all day?"</p>

<p>To Cass's startled, wheeling look, her beady eyes were somewhat
malevolent.</p>

<p>She demanded, weakly, "Where's my baby, Roy?"</p>

<p>"You'll see it in just a li'l' while now, honey."</p>

<p>"A girl?"</p>

<p>"You bet!"</p>

<p>"Emily, my darling baby. Now I'll really live!"</p>

<p>The nurse had edged in through the door. Roy clumped over to
her, listened to her whispering. He turned, with more tenderness in
his beefy face than Cass had seen for thirty years, and said, "Jin,
your old man here is about as all in as you are. I'm going to take
him down and give him a drink. Come on, boy." In the corridor, hand
on Cass's shoulder, he muttered, "Son, you got to have courage. For
her. The baby is dead."</p>

<p>For four hours, while she kept falling asleep, they spared
Jinny. When she insisted on seeing the baby, Roy told her, with a
grave pity, her hand small in his.</p>

<p>She did not make a sound. She lay and stared at them, so
defenseless, slowly beginning to cry.</p>

<p>Long after the doctor had left them, she lay with her face deep
in the pillow, whimpering like a sick and frightened kitten.</p>

<h2>Chapter 38</h2>

<p>Through all of the lingering summer, Cass and she were together
in a shadowed valley of tenderness.</p>

<p>She would see no one but him; she was uneasy even with Roy and
Rose and Bradd. She stayed abed half the day, and followed her
diabetic diet with such severity that Roy snorted, "Look here,
young lady, don't go getting monkish and neurotic on me. Don't
starve yourself. You're having yourself a fine time playacting and
being the perfect patient, but I'm not one bit impressed, because I
know how easy you can slip and go just the other way."</p>

<p>She was "playacting," Cass knew, but her play was a propitiation
of the gods who had so bruised her when she had tried to be
grown-up and a normal mother.</p>

<p>Cass and she sat through the summer evenings in a mosquito-proof
and canvas-roofed pavilion he had put up under the maples on their
lawn. He did not know what she was thinking; she denied that she
was thinking anything at all, and he did not press her. The
tenderness between them was a language above the clumsiness of
words.</p>

<p>She had no wishes of her own. If he wanted to stay home, if he
wanted to drive out to the farther lakes, she was willing. He who
had feared that ambition and careerishness might steal her from him
began now to wish that she had more to do and more longing to do
it. It seemed to him dismayingly that she had not grown at all
since he had first seen her on the witness-stand.</p>

<p>"Jinny, how about trying an easy part-time job in the fall?"</p>

<p>"I don't think I care to. Why? You're not tired of having me
around all the time, are you?"</p>

<p>"I just mean, to keep from brooding."</p>

<p>"I don't brood. I'm perfectly satisfied. I hate these strident,
ambitious women who are always clawing at notoriety."</p>

<p>&mdash;Did I unconsciously do this to her, to make her dependent
on me? A horrible thing to do. I must coax her to see more people.
But what if she likes them too much, again, and finally slips away
from me? I must take the chance.</p>

<p>She did not like walking with him even so far as to the Country
Club, where they would meet people. His sturdy legs needed use, but
when he did leave her for a tramp, like a soldier's route-marching,
his companion was Cleo.</p>

<p>She was a mature and dignified young cat now, not without
affairs of her own, but with Cass she would still condescend to
being a kitten and a playmate. She fought beautifully, pretending
to chew his finger when he whirled her around on her back. When she
walked with him, she was more dog than cat, running through grasses
taller than herself, making enormous leaps straight up from the
covering jungle, to see where he had got to.</p>

<p>When he stopped to rest on a fallen willow by the lake shore,
she came trotting up to entertain him, as of old, by chasing her
tail. Her vaudeville repertoire was limited, but she always
performed it with the most conscientious artistry.<br>
<br></p>

<p>Jinny herself broke her nervous calm. "Darling, I know you're
restless, hanging around the house with me all summer."</p>

<p>He did not tell her what picnics he had planned for her and
himself and the baby, with enchanting equipments of thermos bottles
and rugs.</p>

<p>"I get restless, too, Cass. I go crazy when I listen to that
dratted vacuum cleaner, and even your lawn-mower. I know you want
me to see more people. I'm trying to get myself to, but they still
make me jittery. Let me be a hermit for just a little while yet,
won't you...Our baby! I know you wanted her so."</p>

<p>They had driven out to a secret lake, like a highland tarn,
hidden among white pines and balsam. It was dark, in late
afternoon, and she seemed fragile among the dark pine trunks,
beside the opaque waters.</p>

<p>"Chuck the whole bunch of 'em forever, if you want to," he said,
and she wriggled to be close to him, and safe.</p>

<p>Suddenly and surprisingly she laughed. "Why don't you teach me
golf? If I could be out on the course listening to Boone tell dirty
stories, if I could get over being so damned refined and
melancholy, maybe I'd be okay."</p>

<p>"Fine!" he said, uneasily.<br>
<br></p>

<p>While Cass enjoyed striding the golf course, whooping in the
great winds from the cornfields and manfully waving his clubs, she
was bored by it and finicky&mdash;and showed at once that she could
become a much better player. In a year, she would have beaten him,
and Roy and Bradd would have made his life hellish. It was not
without a guilty relief that he heard her give up golfing.</p>

<p>But at the clubhouse they did meet Jay and the new Pasadena
Laverick, and it was the drinking and feverishness of this foolish
pair, and their brassy ability to take a snub, that won Jinny and
flushed her out of melancholy more than the welcomes of Rose and
Bradd and Chris. With Grand Republic devotion to their friends,
these more solid neighbors had not wanted to intrude, so long as
Jinny desired the privacy of grief. But no such scruples were in
Jay and Pas, and they yelled, "Come and have a gin-and-jitters,
Jin!"</p>

<p>Cass was prepared to have her snub them, but she said
"Swell!"</p>

<p>They shrieked, "Let's all go get drunk with Sabine and the other
bums," and Jin answered affectionately, "I think you got something
there. I dassn't get drunk&mdash;I'm one of these awful creeping
invalids&mdash;but I would like to hear some swing on the
phonograph and see a few human people. Let's go."</p>

<p>Instantly, with no perceptible moment when she passed from timid
refuge to clamorous publicity, apparently without reason or
transition, in September, Jinny was wanting a party every evening,
whether it was a Pruttish solemnity or a Sabine-and-Gillian
debauch, and she was proclaiming again her extreme need of steaks
and marzipan, and not all of Cass's coaxing would keep her from
having one light highball.</p>

<p>It was not Roy who rescued him, since she felt that it was
practically a duty to disobey the doctor, but Bradd, the Husband's
Helper.</p>

<p>He barked at her, with Cass blissfully listening, "I'm no
Puritan, baby. I can drink six Scotches to your one and not show
it. But I know by experience what fools we charming people can make
of ourselves, and I think it would be a fine idea for you to stay
home and try to be nice to your husband at least one evening a
year. Cass is too decent to bully you, but I'm not. If your sense
of inferiority to him annoys you, as it often does me, I'll try to
lighten things by coming in and playing cards with you two, if you
ask me nicely."</p>

<p>"All right, I ask you nicely, you beast!"</p>

<p>She sailed into a haven between brooding and hysteria. There was
again a household of three, gossiping, laughing familiarly, and
Cass was very happy about it, until he noticed how often in
arguments Jinny agreed with Bradd against him, how increasingly she
rebuked him for daring to differ with the elegant-minded Bradd.</p>

<p>Then, coming as suddenly as her earlier moods of silent grief
and relieving wildness and halcyon serenity, they were caught by an
outbreak of quarrels, which are the wars of matrimony, more
destructive and senseless than tanks and cannon, wars in which
affection is the worst traitor and the most ignoble defeat is
victory.<br>
<br></p>

<p>They were going, that October evening, to Madge Dedrick's for
dinner at eight, and Mrs. Dedrick was demanding about punctuality.
She was not so fanatic as Cass, to whom 8:00 meant 7:58 1/2, but
she did annoy society by insisting that 8:00 meant some time before
8:10.</p>

<p>Cass had explained all this to Jinny; oh, he had explained
it!</p>

<p>She was well enough to return to Red Cross work. Indeed the only
evidence of diabetes was a lightness and breathlessness in her, and
a faintly sharpened face which gave her an eager maturity.</p>

<p>She had not yet come home when Cass started to dress. Madge
Dedrick was so elevated a personality, so close in station to an
archbishop or a woman-author-lecturer, that one dressed for dinner
at her house without inquiring. At 7:01 he looked at his watch
again, sighed, and took off his coat. At 7:02 he remarked to Cleo,
"Now where is your lovely young mistress, cat?" At 7:04 he
continued, "Curious that so clear-minded and competent a girl
should be late so often," and, after thirty more seconds of
removing his vest and contemplatively scratching, "Do you suppose
it's just her way of trying to show that she's still an independent
human being?"</p>

<p>Cleo said she didn't know.</p>

<p>At 7:07, in one sock and a bathrobe, he tried to telephone to
Red Cross headquarters, raging that it was wicked of them to keep
his sick wife there so long, but there was no answer.</p>

<p>At 7:26, bathed, shaved for the second time that day, completely
dressed and quivering with worry, he heard Jinny bang into the
downstairs hall, singing "Roll out the Barrel," and skip joyfully
and undiabetically upstairs.</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>hel</i>-lo!" she said cheerfully, as he looked into the
hall.</p>

<p>He did not say that she was late. Both their glances had already
said it adequately. Cleo stalked downstairs as though she would
have nothing to do with such a woman.</p>

<p>"Am I in the dog-house!" muttered Jinny, but with no evidence of
repentance.</p>

<p>He stayed away from her and from the subject, then, till he had
heard her shower-bath and the stillness that indicated she was
making up. He ambled nervously into her room and sat down while
she, a slightly absurd figure in bare shoulders above a gleamingly
hideous satin girdle, was at her dressing-table, penciling entirely
needless and imperceptible touches of blue on her eyelids, with as
much tranquillity as though she had five hours instead of five
minutes.</p>

<p>"Uh&mdash;" he said.</p>

<p>"I know I'm late. I'm hustling."</p>

<p>"Not awful fast, dear; do hurry a little. Madge hates to have
people late."</p>

<p>"You mean&mdash;" In the most leisurely, comfortable way, Jinny
inspected her eyebrows and removed one hair with the tweezers,
after examining the instrument as though she was interested is the
historic evolution of its design and its possible unexplored future
uses. "You mean, sweetheart, that she's also a fanatic about
punctuality?"</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know as I'd call her a <i>fanatic</i>, but she
doesn't care much for having the fish-course spoiled."</p>

<p>"You ought to have married her."</p>

<p>"My dear Jinny, considering that she's almost thirty years older
than I am&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Okay, okay! Then married her daughter. Eve is such a lovely
widow, and quite rich, and still punctual. Just the gal for you, my
boy."</p>

<p>"See here now! I know I'm probably a crank about
punctuality&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How did you guess it?"</p>

<p>"But you go too far the other way. Unpunctual people betray the
fact that they lack all consideration for other people's rights and
feelings."</p>

<p>"Nuts!" She was less merry now. "I'm sick of always being on
time myself, and then being kept waiting."</p>

<p>"<i>When?</i>"</p>

<p>"When?"</p>

<p>"Yes, when! When did you ever have to wait for other
people?"</p>

<p>"Oh, lots of times. I do try to be on the dot, and usually I am,
too, but this rigid punctuality&mdash;it's like any other
bankers-association virtue; it isn't worth making everybody's life
miserable for."</p>

<p>"We're going to make Mrs. Dedrick miserable&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not tonight, because prob'ly Bradd will be later than we
are."</p>

<p>"Bradd? What's he got to do with it?"</p>

<p>"He'll be there tonight."</p>

<p>"But how do you know he'll be late?"</p>

<p>"Because he just left me."</p>

<p>"Oh."</p>

<p>"And he has to do some phoning, as well as change, before he
gets to Madge's."</p>

<p>"You, uh&mdash;You saw Bradd this afternoon...too?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I just told you. He dropped me here."</p>

<p>"I thought you were at the Red Cross, and that closed two
hours&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I was, but I got a headache, and I went out with him just to
get some fresh air."</p>

<p>"Did you phone him or did he just happen to drop in there?"</p>

<p>"I don't even remember. Good Heavens, why all the fuss?"</p>

<p>"I'm not fussing. I was just wondering. Course I'm glad you went
out and&mdash;Where did you go?"</p>

<p>"To the Unstable. Had a drink."</p>

<p>"Or maybe two drinks?"</p>

<p>"Yes, maybe two! And why the cross-examination?"</p>

<p>"Bradd's been an amazingly loyal friend, the way he's backed me
up in my effort to get you to take some rest, but somehow it does
seem as though it's always he who's keeping you up late, or getting
you to take a cocktail&mdash;or a
walnut-mocha-frozen-cream-puff!"</p>

<p>"Cass! Are you criticizing Bradd Criley? Your closest, most
devoted friend, the one man who most admires you as a person and as
a lawyer?"</p>

<p>"No, no, good Lord no! I just meant&mdash;"</p>

<p>Empires have fallen from wars that began with "I just
meant."</p>

<p>She had to hurry now, and they said nothing more, on the way to
Mrs. Dedrick's, than that for a warm October evening, it was warm.
They arrived fifteen minutes late, to find Mrs. Dedrick
malignant&mdash; and to find Bradd, placid and smiling, looking as
though he had been there for years.</p>

<p>Throughout the evening, Cass was rather dreary, but Jinny was
full of lively points. She laughed with Bradd, but no more Cass
noted, than with Harley Bozard or Old Mr. Avondene. He was in a
small torment, but not of jealousy; it was a torment of
self-castigation at finding himself back in her boarding-house,
being schoolboyishly jealous of Eino Roskinen.</p>

<p>&mdash;You took away the poor girl's job and her ambition, maybe
took away her health, and now you resent her even having a few gay
friends. Bradd and she are so open about liking to play around
together that it would be obvious to anybody else that they're
entirely innocent in their liking.</p>

<p>&mdash;We were on the verge of a quarrel tonight. Be careful.
Maybe it's true, as you always claim, that you're never the one
that starts a quarrel, but you're certainly the one that never lets
it go once you get your teeth into it.</p>

<p>&mdash;I trust Bradd. Utterly.</p>

<p>&mdash;I just wish I hadn't heard him tell once about his
technique with young married women&mdash;easing their consciences
by praising their husbands.</p>

<p>&mdash;He wouldn't do that with me&mdash;with Jinny. Anyway,
she's too shrewd. Of course he is fond of her. Who wouldn't be?
Maybe unconsciously he even likes her <i>too</i> much. But never
consciously. But maybe it would be a good idea to suggest to him
that he ought not to get into a way of thinking he is in love with
her.</p>

<p>&mdash;Yes? And how would you say a thing like that to as
experienced an attorney as Mr. Criley, Judge?<br>
<br></p>

<p>In admission of the fact that Jinny was mildly ill, Cass always
took her home at ten&mdash;when he could get her away at ten.
Tonight, he was amiable and firm about it, and in the car he was
unendurably bountiful. It was Jinny, usually an unretaliatory girl
though impulsive, who was looking for trouble and ready to start a
scene.</p>

<p>She jabbed, "You must have been absorbed in weighty thoughts
tonight. You never even listened when Eve was telling us about the
Riviera."</p>

<p>"Heard it all before, I guess."</p>

<p>&mdash;Careful now! She's resentful over your lecture about
punctuality. Be careful.</p>

<p>As they came into the house, he warned himself, "Don't tease her
about Bradd's getting there before we did, after all." So he looked
affectionately at the heat-regulator, and said aloud, "Well, Bradd
got there before we did, after all! We were the last arrivals."</p>

<p>She stopped with her cape in folds about her arms, and launched
her burning dart: "Yes, and he'd taken the trouble to put on a
clean dinner-jacket, too!"</p>

<p>"Do&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't you ever look at yourself in a mirror? Don't you ever try
to be neat?"</p>

<p>"Me?"</p>

<p>"You've had a spot on your lapel all evening."</p>

<p>He craned at a white speck on the ribbed satin, not one of such
dimensions or vile color as to constitute a crime. As he scratched
at it with his thumbnail, impenitent, irritated, she laid her cape
on a chair and turned on him again:</p>

<p>"Years ago, in Florida, I begged you not to slobber all over
yourself. Especially lapels!"</p>

<p>"Yes, we're right back there, Jinny, and you haven't learned a
thing."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, I haven't learned a thing? I've learned
plenty! I've learned that the more you talk about wanting me to be
free and individual, the more you always want me to do only what
you want."</p>

<p>"Dearest, I honestly don't know why you started jumping on
me."</p>

<p>"You don't? Complaining because I went out for a breath of fresh
air with Bradd! Sulking and screaming!"</p>

<p>"My dear girl, you can't sulk and scream at the same time.
They're mutually contradictory."</p>

<p>"The judge-language! It's as phony as preacher-language. By the
way, poor Eino once asked me whether you would ever decide a case
against a very rich man, a Wargate, and I said of course you would,
but I begin to wonder."</p>

<p>While he gaped at this slander, the astounding irrelevancy of
this attack, she marched into the gray-and-mulberry effeminacy of
their living-room. He did not want to follow her; he reminded
himself again that he did not readily give up a war once it had
started.</p>

<p>Then he did want to follow her; he did want to fight the good
bad fight.</p>

<p>She was delicately taking a cigarette from a box of glass,
lighting it with relish, staring at the maimed Isis on her pedestal
for reassurance, then turning toward him with a cold unspoken query
of "Yes, and who may you be?"</p>

<p>She added, aloud, "I'm sure you'd find plenty of excuses for any
Wargate."</p>

<p>He was shouting, shouting small but well into the quarrel.</p>

<p>"Yes, if you really want to know, I'm a complete crook on the
bench. And have you noticed any other faults?"</p>

<p>She enjoyed it as a good household cat enjoys chewing the tail
of a trapped barn-rat. "I don't knew why you're bellowing at me
merely because I asked a civil question&mdash;one that I discussed
with Judge Blackstaff."</p>

<p>"And no doubt with Attorney Bradd Criley!"</p>

<p>"Naturally!"</p>

<p>"I suppose I ought to be glad, though, Jinny, that you take even
this much interest in my work. You rarely do. You never even ask
me, any longer, what cases I've had."</p>

<p>"I know. Poor man. There seem to be two kinds of husbands: those
that complain because their wives butt into their business and
those that complain because they don't&mdash;like you&mdash;and
your energetic friend Vince Osprey!"</p>

<p>He bit hard on a non-existent gag while Jinny breezed on, "And
if you really want to know about your other faults&mdash;I don't
understand why you were so rude to Old Mr. Avondene this
evening&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Me?"</p>

<p>"&mdash;when he was trying to tell about the early days here,
unless it is that you always have to be the center of attention,
you always have to be The Judge, and expect obsequiousness from
everybody."</p>

<p>That there was five per cent of truth in this did not relieve
his injury as she swept on, sweetly, lounging in a couch-corner,
her gestures graceful and patronizing:</p>

<p>"You think that everything you say is of so much importance to
everybody&mdash;not merely to poor untutored me, that you picked up
out of the gutter and tried to educate&mdash;and you don't even try
to make your dictums&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dicta!"</p>

<p>"&mdash;clear, and you talk with your mouth full, and then if it
ever happens that people get sick of your egotism and turn their
heads away from you for even one second, you're furious with
them&mdash;you're mushy with self-pity because you can't put your
importance over!"</p>

<p>He was appalled at her injustice, at her so recent tenderness
turning into this poison, yet he did have humor enough to see the
comedy of her springing on him when he had been so full of
information about <i>her</i> faults of unpunctuality and skipping
off with every man who asked her. He retreated from his high
ground, and said civilly, "I swear, Jinny, I don't know why you
started this scene."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Yes, why?"</p>

<p>"Heaven's sake, don't echo me like a&mdash;like a&mdash;If you
want to know why&mdash;I hesitate to tell you, but after the way
you rode me tonight&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I did not!"</p>

<p>"&mdash;and yelled that I simply love to keep people waiting and
their damn fish spoiling, I'll tell you. Frankly, my friend, I
don't have much fun living with you."</p>

<p>She said it with none of the joyful hysteria of a lovers'
quarrel, but so evenly that he believed her. He urged, slowly and
miserably, "Jinny, I've given you everything I have, and in return,
you are trying to destroy me."</p>

<p>As she casually rose and turned to go upstairs, she answered
with one infinitely contemptuous word:</p>

<p>"Piffle!"</p>

<p>That night they slept without having made it up, without having
spoken again.<br>
<br></p>

<p><b>An Assemblage of Husbands and Wives</b>
</p>

<p><i>Virga Vay &amp; Allan Cedar</i>
</p>

<p>Orlo Vay, the Chippewa Avenue Optician, Smart-Art Harlequin
Tinted-Tortus Frames Our Specialty, was a public figure, as public
as a cemetery. He was resentful that his profession, like that of
an undertaker, a professor of art, or a Mormon missionary, was not
appreciated for its patience and technical skill, as are the
callings of wholesale grocer or mistress or
radiosports-commentator, and he tried to make up for the
professional injustice by developing his personal glamor.</p>

<p>He wanted to Belong. He was a speaker. He was hearty and public
about the local baseball and hockey teams, about the Kiwanis Club,
about the Mayflower Congregational Church, and about all war
drives. At forty-five he was bald, but the nobly glistening egg of
his face and forehead, whose arc was broken only by a pair of Vay
Li-Hi-Bifocals, was an adornment to all fund-raising rallies.</p>

<p>He urged his wife, Virga, to co-operate in his spiritual
efforts, but she was a small, scared, romantic woman, ten years his
junior; an admirer of passion in technicolor, a clipper-out of
newspaper lyrics about love and autumn smoke upon the hills. He
vainly explained to her, "In these modern days, a woman can't
fritter away her time daydreaming. She has to push her own weight,
and not hide it under a bushel."</p>

<p>Her solace was in her lover, Dr. Allan Cedar, the dentist.
Together, Virga and Allan would have been a most gentle pair,
small, clinging, and credulous. But they could never be openly
together. They were afraid of Mr. Vay and of Allan's fat and
vicious wife, Bertha, and they met at soda counters in outlying
drug stores and lovingly drank black-and-whites together or Jumbo
Malteds and, giggling, ate ferocious banana splits; or, till
wartime gasoline-rationing prevented, they sped out in Allan's
coupe by twilight, and made shy, eager love in mossy pastures or,
by the weak dashlight of the car, read aloud surprisingly good
recent poets: Wallace Stevens, Sandburg, Robert Frost, Jeffers, T.
S. Eliot, Lindsay.</p>

<p>Allan was one of the best actors in the Masquers, and though
Virga could not act, she made costumes and hung about at
rehearsals, and thus they were able to meet, and to stir the
suspicions of Bertha Cedar.</p>

<p>Mrs. Cedar was a rare type of the vicious woman; she really
hated her husband, though she did not so much scold him as mock him
for his effeminate love of acting, for his verses, for his cherubic
mustache, and even for his skill with golden bridgework. She
jeered, in the soap-reeking presence of her seven sisters and
sisters-in-law, all chewing gum and adjusting their plates, that as
a lover "Ally" had no staying-powers. That's what <i>she</i>
thought.</p>

<p>She said to her mother, "Ally is a bum dentist; he hasn't got a
single rich patient," and when they were at an evening party, she
communicated to the festal guests, "Ally can't even pick out a
necktie without asking my help," and on everything her husband said
she commented, "Oh, don't be silly!"</p>

<p>She demanded, and received, large sympathy from all the females
she knew, and as he was fond of golf and backgammon, she refused to
learn either of them.</p>

<p>Whenever she had irritated him into jumpiness, she said
judiciously, "You seem to be in a very nervous state." She picked
at him about his crossword puzzles, about his stamp-collection,
until he screamed, invariably, "Oh, let me <i>alone!</i>" and then
she was able to say smugly, "I don't know what's the matter with
you, so touchy about every little thing. You better go to a
mind-doctor and have your head examined."</p>

<p>Then Bertha quite unexpectedly inherited seven thousand dollars
and a house in San Jose, California, from a horrible aunt. She did
not suggest to her husband but told him that they would move out to
that paradise for chilled Minnesotans, and he would practise
there.</p>

<p>It occurred to Allan to murder her, but not to refuse to go
along. Many American males confuse their wives and the policeman on
the beat.</p>

<p>But he knew that it would be death for him to leave Virga Vay,
and that afternoon, when Virga slipped into his office at three
o'clock in response to his code telephone call of "This is the
Superba Market and we're sending you three bunches of asparagus,"
she begged, "Couldn't we elope some place together? Maybe we could
get a little farm."</p>

<p>"She'd find us. She has a cousin who's a private detective in
Duluth."</p>

<p>"Yes, I guess she would. Can't we <i>ever</i> be together
always?"</p>

<p>"There is one way&mdash;if you wouldn't be afraid."</p>

<p>He explained the way.</p>

<p>"No, I wouldn't be afraid, if you stayed right with me," she
said.<br>
<br></p>

<p>Dr. Allan Cedar was an excellent amateur machinist. On a Sunday
afternoon when Bertha was visiting her mother, he cut a hole
through the steel bottom of the luggage compartment of his small
dark-gray coupe. This compartment opened into the body of the car.
That same day he stole the hose of their vacuum-cleaner and
concealed it up on the rafters of their galvanized-iron garage.</p>

<p>On Tuesday&mdash;this was in February&mdash;he bought a blue
ready-made suit at Goldenkron Brothers', on Ignatius Street. He was
easy to fit, and no alterations were needed. They wanted to deliver
the suit that afternoon, but he insisted, "No, hold it here for me
and I'll come in and put it on tomorrow morning. I want to surprise
somebody."</p>

<p>"Your Missus will love it, Doc," said Monty Goldenkron.</p>

<p>"I hope she will&mdash;when she sees it!"</p>

<p>He also bought three white-linen shirts and a red bow-tie, and
paid cash for the lot.</p>

<p>"Your credit is good here, Doc&mdash;none better," protested
Monty.</p>

<p>Allan puzzled him by the triumphant way in which he answered, "I
want to keep it good, just now!"</p>

<p>From Goldenkrons' he walked perkily to the Emporium, to the
Golden Rule drug store, to the Co-operative Dairy, paying his bills
in full at each. On his way he saw a distinguished fellow-townsman,
Judge Timberlane, and his pretty wife. Allan had never said ten
words to either of them, but he thought affectionately, "There's a
couple who are intelligent enough and warm-hearted enough to know
what love is worth."</p>

<p>That evening he said blandly to his wife, "Strangest thing
happened today. The University school of dentistry telephoned
me."</p>

<p>"Long distance?"</p>

<p>"Surely."</p>

<p>"Well!" Her tone was less of disbelief than of disgust.</p>

<p>"They're having a special brush-up session for dentists and they
want me to come down to Minneapolis first thing tomorrow morning to
stay for three days and give instruction in bridge-work. And of
course you must come along. It's too bad I'll have to work from
nine in the morning till midnight&mdash;they do rush those special
courses so&mdash;but you can go to the movies by yourself, or just
sit comfortably in the hotel."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;thank&mdash;<i>you!</i>" said Bertha. "I prefer to sit
here at home. Why you couldn't have been an M.D. doctor and take
out gall-bladders and make some real money! And I'll thank you to
be home not later than Sunday morning. You know we have Sunday
dinner with Mother."</p>

<p>He knew.</p>

<p>"I hope that long before that I'll be home," he said.</p>

<p>He told her that he would be staying at the Flora Hotel, in
Minneapolis. But on Wednesday morning, after putting on the new
suit at Goldenkrons', he drove to St. Paul, through light
snowflakes which he thought of as fairies. "But I haven't a bit of
real poet in me. Just second-rate and banal," he sighed. He tried
to make a poem, and got no farther than:</p>

<blockquote>It is snowing,<br>
The wind is blowing,<br>
But I am happy to be going.</blockquote>

<p>In St. Paul he went to the small, clean Hotel Orkness,
registered as "Mr. A. M. Romeo &amp; wife," asked for a room with a
double bed, and explained to the clerk, "My wife is coming by
train. She should be here in about seventeen minutes now, I figure
it."</p>

<p>He went unenthusiastically to the palsied elevator, up to their
room. It was tidy, and on the wall was an Adolph Dehn lithograph
instead of the fake English-hunting-print that he had dreaded. He
kneaded the bed with his fist. He was pleased.</p>

<p>Virga Vay arrived nineteen minutes later, with a bellboy
carrying her new imitation-leather bag.</p>

<p>"So you're here, husband. Not a bad room," she said
indifferently.</p>

<p>The bellboy knew from her indifference and from her calling the
man "husband" that she was not married to him, but unstintingly in
love. Such paradoxes are so common in his subterranean business
that he had forgotten about Virga by the time he reached his bench
in the lobby. Six stories above him, Virga and Allan were lost and
blind and quivering in their kiss.</p>

<p>Presently she said, "Oh, you have a new suit! Turn around. Why,
it fits beautifully! And such a nice red tie. You do look so young
and cute in a bow-tie. Did you get it for me?"</p>

<p>"Of course. And then&mdash;I kind of hate to speak of it now,
but I want us to get so used to the idea that we can just forget
it&mdash;I don't want us to look frowsy when they find us. As if we
hadn't been happy. And we <i>will</i> be&mdash;we are!"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You're still game for it?"</p>

<p>"With you? For anything."</p>

<p>He was taking off the new suit; she was tenderly lifting from
her bag a nightgown which she had made and embroidered this past
week.</p>

<p>They had all their meals in the room; they did not leave it till
afternoon of the next day. The air became a little close, thick
from perfume and cigarette smoke and the bubble baths they took
together.</p>

<p>Late the next afternoon they dressed and packed their bags,
completely. He laid on the bureau two ten-dollar bills. They left
the luggage at the foot of their bed, which she had made up. She
took nothing from the room, and he nothing except a paper bag
containing a bottle of Bourbon whisky, with the cork loosened, and
a pocket anthology of new poetry. At the door she looked back, and
said to him, "I shall remember this dear room as long as we
live."</p>

<p>"Yes...As long as we live."</p>

<p>He took his dark-gray coupe out of the hotel garage, tipping an
amazed attendant one dollar, and they drove to Indian Mounds Park,
overlooking the erratic Mississippi. He stopped in the park, at
dusk, and said, "Think of the Indians that came along here, and
Pike and Lewis Cass!"</p>

<p>"They were brave," she mused.</p>

<p>"Brave, <i>too!</i>" They nervously laughed. Indeed, after a
moment of solemnity when they had left the hotel, they had been
constantly gay, laughing at everything, even when she sneezed and
he piped, "No more worry about catching pneumonia!"</p>

<p>He drove into a small street near by and parked the car, distant
from any house. Working in the half-darkness, leaving the engine
running, he pushed the vacuum-cleaner hose through the hole in the
bottom of the luggage compartment, wired it to the exhaust pipe,
and hastily got back into the car. The windows were closed. Already
the air in the car was sick-sweet with carbon monoxide.</p>

<p>He slipped the whisky bottle out of the paper bag and tenderly
urged, "Take a swig of this. Keep your courage up."</p>

<p>"Dearest, I don't need anything to keep it up."</p>

<p>"I do, by golly. I'm not a big he-man like you, Virg!"</p>

<p>They both laughed, and drank from the bottle, and kissed
lingeringly.</p>

<p>"I wonder if I could smoke a cigarette. I don't <i>think</i>
C2O2 is explosive," he speculated.</p>

<p>"Oh, sweet, be careful! It <i>might</i> explode!"</p>

<p>"Yes, it&mdash;" Then he shouted. "Listen at us! As if we cared
if we got blown up now!"</p>

<p>"Oh, I am too brainless, Allan! I don't know if you'll be able
to stand me much longer."</p>

<p>"As long as we live, my darling, my very dear, oh, my dear
love!"</p>

<p>"As long as we live. Together now. Together."</p>

<p>His head aching, his throat sore, he forgot to light the
cigarette. He switched on the tiny dashlight, he lifted up the book
as though it were a bar of lead, and from Conrad Aiken's "Sea
Holly" he began to read to her:</p>

<blockquote>It was for this<br>
Barren beauty, barrenness of rock that aches<br>
On the seaward path, seeing the fruitful sea,<br>
Hearing the lark of rock that sings&mdash;</blockquote>

<p>He was too drowsy to read more than just the ending:</p>

<blockquote>Stone pain in the stony heart,<br>
The rock loved and labored; and all is lost.</blockquote>

<p>The book fell to the seat, his head drooped, and his arm groped
drowsily about her. She rested contentedly, in vast dreams, her
head secure upon his shoulder.</p>

<p>Harsh screaming snatched them back from paradise. The car
windows were smashed, someone was dragging them out...and Bertha
was slapping Virga's face, while Bertha's cousin, the detective,
was beating Allan's shoulders with a blackjack, to bring him to. In
doing so, he broke Allan's jaw. Bertha drove him back to Grand
Republic and nursed him while he was in bed, jeering to the harpies
whom she had invited in, "Ally tried to&mdash;you know&mdash;with a
woman, but he was no good, and he was so ashamed he tried to kill
himself."</p>

<p>He kept muttering, "Please go away and don't torture me."</p>

<p>She laughed.</p>

<p>Later, Bertha was able to intercept every one of the letters
that Virga sent to him from Des Moines, where she had gone to work
in a five-and-ten-cent store after Orlo had virtuously divorced
her.</p>

<p>"Love! Ally is learning what that kind of mush gets you," Bertha
explained to her attentive women friends.</p>

<h2>Chapter 39</h2>

<p>Their Autumn season of quarrels was to Cass as devastating and
as senseless as a thunderstorm. Jinny was ill, and sometimes bored,
yet why hadn't she imagination enough to see that he was often
bored and worried as well? Why, when most of the time she was gay
and full of small surprises for him and seemed tranquilly to love
him, did she, under the horrible black magic of the quarrel, turn
in ten seconds into his enemy, the hearth-fire suddenly burning
down the house?</p>

<p>What did Jinny want? Security, scenery, power, the ability to
recognize a quotation from Steinbeck, a ruby-and-diamond bracelet,
a sense of self-discipline, the love of a tangible God, a red canoe
with yellow cushions, an unblemished skin, venison with sauce
Cumberland, many children, a seventy-five-dollar hat from New York,
a request to speak on a nation-wide hookup, dawn beside Walden
Pond, the certainty of her husband's affection, or an Irish
wolfhound? He did not know, and she was not quite certain. And in
which of these virtuous desires could he most sympathize with
her?</p>

<p>It was difficult for each of them to guess the other's momentary
moods. They ought to be labeled, for warning. He ought to put on
the sign, "Stern jurist&mdash;he careful" or "Playboy&mdash;willing
to dance"; she should bear the direction "Wistful little girl" or
"Termagant&mdash;dangerous" or "Sensitive artist who has been
drawing in secret but expects her husband to be so discerning as to
guess it and congratulate her." Then each of them would know how to
start off the evening, and have nothing to quarrel
about&mdash;except each other's friends, which will be a
troublesome topic even among the angels in Heaven, where spirit
will say crossly to spirit, "Who was that awful harp-player I saw
you flying with last eon?"</p>

<p>There were many springboards for quarrels: he liked the windows
open, she shriveled in the cold; he liked pork chops, she liked
chow mein; he had been too jocular with Diantha Marl, she too
chilly with Judge Flaaten; he wanted to stay home, she wanted to go
to the movies&mdash;so they went to the movies. And there he dared
to consider himself a cinema critic and sniffed at her beloved
swing musicians capering as would-be actors. But of them all, there
was only one cause: they did not know what they wanted.</p>

<p>There were so many things that could lead to disagreements;
there were so many disagreements that could lead to quarrels. As
with almost any couple, she would insist on candlelight and he
would snort that he liked to be able to see what he was eating. She
would devote artistic agonies to curtains, and he would demand why
it was that you dug a window through the wall to get air and light,
and then covered it over, very expensively, so that you got
neither. He would irritably feel that he must have her permission
before he invited the Wolkes in, and discover that she was sulky
because she had been thinking that she must have his permission to
do the same thing.</p>

<p>Their quarrels always went the same course and always wound up
in the same accusations, dreary as slate and vicious as secret
poison. They said things they could not possibly have said. He
called her a "sponge" and a "torturer"; she shrieked that he was
unimaginative, ignorant, and a liar. Usually, somewhere early in
the quarrel, was the rueful, "I was just enjoying myself so much,
and now you've gone and spoiled it all."</p>

<p>Slights that had been forgotten for months woke up, and they
protested, "What did you mean when you said I 'liked to hurt
people's feelings' that time&mdash;last January, I think it was?"
And, "I won't stand any more of this!" with "Is that so!" regarded
as a logical answer. The ritual response to "If you're going to be
stubborn, I'll just have to show you I can be stubborn, too!" was
"You don't have to <i>show</i> me!" and to "Now whose fault was
<i>that</i>, I'd like to know!" the counterblow was "Not <i>my</i>
fault, certainly!"</p>

<p>And "Of course anything that Bradd or Tracy (or Chris or Stella)
does is <i>perfect</i>, but if I do anything, it's always wrong."
And&mdash; once the two of them began saying it at the same
time&mdash;"The trouble with you is, you're utterly
<i>selfish</i>." And sometimes, from either of them, the senseless,
maniacal "Oh, shut up, shut up, shut up!" or the calmly said,
devastating "I can tell you what I'M going to do: I'm going to
leave this house right now, and I hope I never see you again. Oh, I
mean it&mdash;this time. Never!"</p>

<p>None of their slurs meant anything except that each of them was
unhappy because the other was unhappy. They were not things said;
they were sweeps of their claws, in the jungle; and they were less
distressing than the long, thick silences, during the quarrels,
when they sat blankly, trying to think what it was that they were
trying to think.</p>

<p>When they made up, as they always did, they wailed, "Oh, I
couldn't have said that to you. I know I couldn't, because I've
never even thought it."</p>

<p>They had said it, though.</p>

<p>"How could we ever have acted like that?" they marveled, and
they vowed, "We'll never quarrel again, not over <i>anything!</i>
Why, darling, you can call me a three-tailed monster, and I'll take
it and like it."</p>

<p>She begged, "You take me too seriously, when I fly off the
handle. It doesn't mean a thing&mdash;it's just one of my tantrums.
When I act childish, if you'd just say, 'There, there now, baby,'
why, I'd snap right out of it."</p>

<p>She didn't.</p>

<p>He asserted that, if they had to change themselves in order to
avoid quarreling, it was she who could change most, because she was
less stiffened by the formalism of law and politics. Ah, there, she
said enthusiastically, was an idea! For two days she was
energetically holy and patient, after which they quarreled because
he had not noticed it.</p>

<p>Sometimes in the most heated middle of a dispute, he most loved
her, and he was violent and rather unpleasant with her only because
he was afraid.</p>

<p>He realized now that it was he who loved the more, but he knew
that in love it is truly more blessed to give than to receive, and
he was sorry for her that&mdash;apparently&mdash;she could not know
the exaltation of passion for another being.</p>

<p>After every quarrel, when the emotion had burned itself out, he
was as confused about what had happened as a man who has been in
delirium.</p>

<p>&mdash;Just how did I get angry at her, anyway? Just what was it
I said, and how did she answer? I seem to have said dreadful
things, but I can't remember.</p>

<p>&mdash;But it won't happen again. Now that I understand that her
moods are never as deep as they seem, I'll be patient. And so will
she. She finally <i>said</i> she would! The trouble with her is
that she's too honest. She has to blurt out whatever she thinks.
She couldn't ever conceal anything: a dislike or an unhappiness or
a passionate liking. But now that I understand this, we won't have
any more disagreements&mdash;no more&mdash;ever!</p>

<h2>Chapter 40</h2>

<p>She had gone to bed early, that November evening, purring, "I
think I'll get enough rest for once, just to show I can do it."</p>

<p>"Shall I come in and kiss you good night, when I come up?"</p>

<p>"No, I'll probably be asleep. But I'll allow you to kiss me
now." Decisively. But quite affectionately. But quite
decisively.</p>

<p>That was before ten. He would normally have read&mdash;"have
caught up on his reading," as he put it&mdash;till twelve or one,
but he sat brooding about her. He longed to make love to her, he
was cold without her warmth, he was lonely without her reaching out
for him. All evening he had been lonely for her even while he was
in her presence, not ten feet away.</p>

<p>The weather of late autumn was angry, and their cabin of steel
and rock-wool and white pine and stucco seemed to be shaking in the
gale. He felt snatched back ninety years ago, to the pioneer
insecurities of the far-northern winter. He draped the mulberry
curtains about him to shut off the light of the room, and looked
out, toward a street lamp, through slanting lines of sleet. The
blue spruce in the yard was glassy with wet and hateful
coldness.</p>

<p>If he could be up there, cozy with her, some miracle might
restore the passion she had once felt for him.</p>

<p>He turned back into the room, stared at a gilt clock, stared at
the crystal Isis, without seeing them. Cleo came blandly talking
around his feet, like a little feline floor-walker in a department
store of the affections, but he did not hear her. He was admitting,
for the first time unflinchingly, that though they had been married
a month less than two years, though his passion was only the
stronger, he had become hesitating about revealing it to her,
because he was no longer sure how much of it she could
return&mdash; not sure that she felt any of it at all.</p>

<p>He reflected that she never, of herself, came to his bed now,
and that he never went to hers with certainty that her arched and
welcoming arms would greet him.</p>

<p>Oh, it would come out all right&mdash;there were
reasons&mdash;she was ill but she would get better&mdash;their
quarrels had curdled her simple emotions&mdash;she was still too
interested in other men, Jay and Bradd and Greg Marl and
God-knows-who. But in a few years she would grow up and she would
be well and then all her ardor would be for him alone.</p>

<p>But he did not want her "in a few years"; he wanted her
tonight.</p>

<p>He chased Cleo into the kitchen rather crossly; he put out the
downstairs lights, tiptoed up, and guiltily listened outside her
door. He heard nothing.</p>

<p>Probably asleep. Well, that was fine, wasn't it? He was glad she
was taking care of herself, wasn't he? He'd just undress and read
in his dressing-gown. She, uh, she might awaken and want him to
read aloud to her...Not that she ever did or ever had...Still, she
might...He'd keep the door of his room open, so he could
listen.</p>

<p>When he had undressed, he heard from her room the tap of a
cosmetic bottle or perhaps a pair of manicure scissors on the glass
top of her dressing-table.</p>

<p>She was unable to get to sleep then?</p>

<p>Too bad, but&mdash;</p>

<p>He took a long time in going to make a light tattoo on her door.
He was restrained by the singularly disconcerting memory of having
read somewhere about "The sneaking look that every wife sees on the
face of her husband when he ventures into her room."</p>

<p>Damn it, something wrong with both of them, then! So he marched
in.</p>

<p>She said "Hello" blithely; she looked up from her dressing-table
pleasantly, and most pleasantly she commented, "You going to bed
early too?"</p>

<p>That was the trouble; she was so pleasant and safe, and so
unmoved by his entrance; she had neither rapture nor wrath nor
fear. Well, he didn't expect too much; but she had no
<i>interest!</i></p>

<p>"Isn't it kind of late for you to be making up, young lady? You
planning to go to the club?"</p>

<p>"Sure. And dance!...Oh, I couldn't drop off to sleep, so I'm
trying some experiments with mascara."</p>

<p>He folded his hands round her breasts, kissed the top of her
head. Her whole body remained still, unquivering. She patted one of
his hands, too amiably, and she turned her head to look into the
mirror again, forgetting him.</p>

<p>"Good night," he said sadly, and with the most sweet and
devastating carelessness she answered, "Night, dear."</p>

<p>In his great chair, he did not read. He was trying not to think
of the name of Bradd Criley.<br>
<br></p>

<p>He had been doubting the entire innocence of Bradd's solicitude
for Jinny, and he had been guiltily relieved when the gossiping
Madge Dedrick had let him into the secret that Bradd was showing
too much interest in Bernice, wife of Perry Claywheel,
superintendent of schools. Bernice had a pale Swinburnian beauty;
pale beyond porch and portal and movie-theater lobby she stood,
hoping that people were thinking how interesting she looked. Even
Mrs. Dedrick admitted that she had a "kind of washed-out good
looks."</p>

<p>To that information (Cass remembered now) he had objected, "I do
hope you're wrong; I hope Bradd hasn't got tangled up with
anybody," as sincerely as possible, which was not very sincerely.
"Claywheel is anemic, but he's a good scholar and very kind to the
kids, and I wouldn't want him to be hurt. I know Bradd is an expert
charmer, but I don't think he'd ever be such a poor sportsman, and
so treacherous, as to stalk easy game like Bernice."</p>

<p>Madge had jeered, "Your friend Bradd is a busy man, and the only
reason he doesn't rope in all the women&mdash;including me and my
daughter and your wife&mdash;is that he can't find time. Don't you
think for one moment that Ber-nyce will monopolize him." So Cass
remembered, in his chair.</p>

<p>&mdash;I wonder if the explanation of Bradd's recent attentions
to Jinny could be that he is pretending to be so taken with
her&mdash;but in all propriety, of course&mdash;in order to mask an
intrigue with Bernice?</p>

<p>&mdash;Cass, you know you don't believe that!</p>

<p>&mdash;I have to. I'll believe anything, except that these two,
nearest to me in the world, are beginning to conspire against
me.<br>
<br></p>

<p>Bradd did not drop in so often, now that Jinny was not homebound
by illness and pregnancy, but he was even more intimate. He knew
where the fuse-box was, and the orange bitters, and the saltines;
he knew how to work the electric dish-washer; he knew the fact that
Jinny liked a cup of beef tea&mdash;that is, she didn't like it,
but she was willing to consume it before she went to bed.</p>

<p>On Mrs. Higbee's Thursday-night-out, Jinny had invited Bradd in
for cold supper.</p>

<p>"You sit still and take it easy and Jin and I will bounce out to
the kitchen and bring in the chow," said Bradd patronizingly to Old
Man Timberlane.</p>

<p>The Old Man was irritated, and at supper not very
conversational. His liveliest thoughts were that he hated cold ham
and sausage and tongue, and that he considered cold artichoke
vinaigrette one of the least excusable substitutes for food.</p>

<p>Bradd rumbled, "Don't disturb the Jedge. He's thinking about
quos Deus vult perdere prius dementat."</p>

<p>"Is that legal Latin?" Jinny asked admiringly.</p>

<p>"Well, it could be, in certain cases. And then again, the Jedge
might be thinking about the Supreme Court bench."</p>

<p>"Or about his corns!" giggled Jinny.</p>

<p>"Go on, tease me all you want to, children. I'm tired," Cass
said good-naturedly. He hoped it sounded good-natured.</p>

<p>"Aw, the old fellow is tired," mocked Jinny.</p>

<p>"Sure. He's all worn out fining lawyers for contempt of
court!"</p>

<p>With a nameless melancholy, Cass could not rise to their gaiety.
He sat owlishly watching the Bright Young People. He warned
himself, "She's having a good time. I mustn't spoil it for her."
But he again felt lonely for her even in her presence; he felt left
out of it, felt that it was he who was the unnecessary and
tolerated third.</p>

<p>They were talking derisively about that earnest young attorney
Vincent Osprey and his blundering devotion to his wife Cerise. Cass
noted that under Bradd's tutelage, Jinny was increasingly
supercilious about people who did not know bridge, Vogue magazine,
and wine vintages...Not that Bradd or she knew much about any of
them, either.</p>

<p>Bradd cackled, "Vince said to me he wished he could get his dear
Cerise to come to court and listen to him. He said she admired his
tennis, and was all het up about his high diving, and maybe if he
could sell her on his oratory, she would quit thinking he was the
family cow."</p>

<p>"You don't give Vince credit," Jinny jeered. "He's very
important. He's finally proved that virtue is always duller than
vice."</p>

<p>Cass burst. "You two superior intellects make me tired! Osprey
is no Rufus Choate, but there's nothing funny about the poor
devil's adoration of his wife. He'd die for her, and she'd be
amused watching him do it."</p>

<p>"Do you think that's very sensible of him?" objected Jinny.</p>

<p>"No, I think it's idiotic, but somehow heroic, in this day of
loose affections."</p>

<p>"Tut!" pronounced his wife. "It's idioticer than it is heroic.
You know, Cass, sometimes I think Vince Osprey is a burlesque of
your own remarkable virtues."</p>

<p>"I find nothing whatever funny about marital fidelity and
devotion!"</p>

<p>"Well, I'm sure we're glad to hear that," she said coolly. "I'll
get the cake and ice cream."</p>

<p>When she was gone, Bradd seriously admonished him, "You oughtn't
to yell at Jinny like that, Cass. I wonder if you realize how
sensitive she is, even when she's being funny. You ought not to
pick on her so. Well, I better go help her with the dessert."</p>

<p>Cass was exploding with emotions, all colored red. For this
outsider to tell <i>him</i> that Jinny was sensitive! to tell
<i>him</i> not to "pick on her"! to pat her pretty back after she
had ridiculed every sanctity of love!</p>

<p>He cooled down and thought it all over again. He was angry, and
then, as usual, he fretted, "Mustn't spoil her party." But hot or
cold, he came always to the same verdict:</p>

<p>"This is just a little bit too much! I don't like guests, no
matter who they are, that come in and make over my house!"</p>

<p>He noted that Bradd and Jinny took five minutes to bring in
three plates of ice cream and sponge cake. All the rest of the
evening he was violently quiet and painfully amiable, and
spectacularly did not notice it at all when Bradd kissed Jinny good
night on the cheek as though it were anything but her cheek that he
was kissing.</p>

<p>When Jinny had gone to bed, Cass thought over the case he had
had in court two days before, an accident case, with Vincent Osprey
representing the injured workman and Bradd Criley the Wargate
Corporation. Bradd had been so suave&mdash;too suave. Cass had
advised Vince, in chambers, to use witnesses less melodramatic and
more factual, but Vince could not get away from the charms of
sobbing relatives.</p>

<p>The deft Mr. Criley had won.<br>
<br></p>

<p>After lunch at the Federal Club, Roy Drover commanded Cass,
"Come on in the bar. I want to talk to you."</p>

<p>When they were in two red-leather chairs with elephantiasis, Roy
grumbled:</p>

<p>"I'm supposed to be a friend of yours as well as your physician,
and of Bradd's, too, and I know I'm risking all that by butting in,
but I'm not one of these hand-holding bedside docs. I'm too much of
a man to sit back and watch you make a fool of yourself."</p>

<p>"What&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Fellow, you got to do something about Bradd and your wife.
Town's beginning to talk. They're playing a little too much
footie-footie."</p>

<p>"Now you look&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hey, hold your horses, Cass. Don't get sore, I want you to look
at this in a practical way. Don't get sore at the kid, either;
she's fairly young, and a lot less brainy 'n you give her credit
for. I just want you to stop all their sweetie stuff before it goes
too far. And don't get sore."</p>

<p>"I'm not&mdash;really. But it's all nonsense. I know Jinny and
Bradd are good friends, but I'm glad of it, and they never even see
each other, except at my house in my presence."</p>

<p>"Sure of that?"</p>

<p>"Oh, sometimes they drive down to the Unstable for a drink, but
she always tells me about it, and they invite me to come and join
them...usually."</p>

<p>"What would you say if I told you they were meeting at plenty of
other places?"</p>

<p>"I'd say that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Careful, now!"</p>

<p>"I would doubt it. Oh, sometimes by accident, of
course&mdash;city as small as this&mdash;but never deliberately,
never, and&mdash;Where do they meet?"</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know that they go to Bradd's house, though I've
seen her driving that way, all by herself. You're in court all day;
you don't get around like I do! And I definitely saw them having
lunch together at that God-awful little Italian doggery or
fettacheeney or whatever they call it, Lorenzo's, I think they call
it, way down on Isanti Avenue, in the South End. I had a patient
down there, and I saw 'em through the window in the Italian dump,
and I was in the house nearly two hours, and when I came out, the
little love-birds were still there, laughing and having themselves
a whale of a time. Did she ever tell you about that?"</p>

<p>"No, she&mdash;Oh, I don't remember. Anyway, there's nothing to
it."</p>

<p>"I know there isn't. There's nothing to having one pneumococcus
in your throat, but when you get a few billion, you're sick.
Anyway, they certainly are seeing a lot more of each other than you
know or I know."</p>

<p>"Don't be a suspicious old woman, Roy. Get down to fundamentals.
Look at their characters."</p>

<p>"I have!"</p>

<p>"Next to you, Bradd is my oldest and closest friend. When the
three of us went hunting, as kids&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We're not kids any more. At least, I ain't! Sure, Bradd is a
good guy&mdash;except he thinks he's called to be God's little gift
to women. He wouldn't steal your pocketbook&mdash;unless it had
over a thousand bucks in it&mdash;but if he stole your wife, he'd
think he was doing her a favor&mdash;and maybe you."</p>

<p>"That'd be black treachery, and Bradd couldn't ever be
treacherous. I know him in the court room. He enjoys life and
enjoys people and he'd do anything for you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Say, for God's sake, is your whole family conducting an
advertising campaign for Mr. Criley? Sure, the jolly little
playboy, and underneath his whimsy-whamsy, he's the coldest-hearted
rich-man's lawyer and the most calculating woman-chaser in the
State of Minnesota. You know that. It don't keep him from being a
swell pal on the duck-pass, but he's no bishop.</p>

<p>"Now I don't believe they're sleeping together&mdash;not yet.
But same time, after having her baby and being sick and all the
rest, and married to a man who's no infant, she isn't the timid
virgin any longer. I don't think she's actually two-timing you, and
I guess she'd prefer to run straight, but she'd no longer be as
scared of a little romp in the hay as&mdash;well, as you'd be. I
think you can stop her, and I think you <i>should</i>, but first
you got to find out what's actually going on.</p>

<p>"Say, I got an idea. Why don't I tell Lillian to snoop around
and follow them and find out what they're up to? She's none too
smart, but they'd never suspect <i>her</i>, and I <i>will</i> say
you can trust her to keep her trap shut."</p>

<p>Cass was too astonished to be indignant. Of all women living,
Roy's shrinking wife was probably the least suited to spying.</p>

<p>"Well, what do you think of the idea?"</p>

<p>"No, I wouldn't want that done for anything!"</p>

<p>"Don't you <i>want</i> to know what they're up to?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I suppose I do."</p>

<p>"Don't you think it's important?"</p>

<p>"Roy, it's confusing for a man who's supposed to be reasonably
decent to believe that his wife, whom he worships, for whom he'd
throw overboard everything and everybody, may be an adultress."</p>

<p>"There's an old-fashioned word for you!"</p>

<p>"It's an old-fashioned quandary. It goes back to Eve and the
serpent. I'm sure the real discussion in Eden wasn't about apples.
Hang it, I don't know which is worse: to believe that a woman's
adultery is the only form of disloyalty that matters, and she ought
to be smashed for it; or to have this new-fangled idea that it
doesn't matter at all, that infidelity is all good fun between
friends. Both attitudes make me sick. But to have to think of such
things about Jinny..."</p>

<p>"I always did tell you you had no sense of humor, Cass, and
you're a fanatic about your wife. You laymen never understand
psychology, like a doc has to. Jinny's all right&mdash;I
guess&mdash;but she ain't the poet's dream you make her out to be,
not by a long shot. The sooner you realize it and tell her she can
either behave herself or get out, the happier you'll be.
Incidentally, she's made you look a lot older."</p>

<p>"That's nonsense."</p>

<p>"It is, eh? That's a guaranteed way of getting old&mdash;trying
to keep up with a skittish wife. Okay. My only interest in the
whole business is that in my own roughneck way&mdash;I guess I'm
too forthright and scientific for the kind of Eastern, pansy burg
that Grand Republic is getting to be&mdash;my only concern is, I
don't like to see you taken for a ride."</p>

<p>There was more of it, much more, but Cass did not hear him.<br>
<br></p>

<p>He was not sleepy in court that afternoon. He listened with
bleak attention to a case involving the theft of a woman's good
name and seven pounds of grass seed. He looked grim as a wintertime
Sioux warrior as he tacked and skidded his car on the
December-bleached roadway.</p>

<p>As he walked into the house, he heard Jinny telephoning:</p>

<p>"I don't know...No, I can't tell...I'll see-ee...Now don't be so
naughty, and keep coaxing...Bye, dear."</p>

<p>He did not ask to whom she was telephoning. He knew.</p>

<p>He was attentive through dinner, and then, for the first time,
he launched a quarrel intentionally:</p>

<p>"Sit down, Jinny, and be quiet. I want to talk."</p>

<p>"Do&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, I intend to start a 'scene'&mdash;a bad one. Look. Bradd
Criley is around this house too much, and you see too much of him
outside. I don't think it's gone too far yet&mdash;now
listen!&mdash;but it certainly will if you don't come to your
senses. I grant you all of his charms and virtues, and don't tell
me what a good friend of mine he's been&mdash;I know it. But he's a
thief&mdash;a thief of love and a thief of security, a scheming and
deliberate thief. He wants what he wants, and he doesn't care much
how many lives he may twist in getting it. I don't intend to see
him let you down, as he lets down every friend, every woman, when
he gets tired of them. That's all I have to say, but I warn you, I
mean it."</p>

<p>"Are you quite finished?"</p>

<p>"I hope so. Except that I'm now convinced that it's been Bradd
in the background who's been the unseen cause of most of our
quarrels. That's all."</p>

<p>"Then let me tell you, just let me tell you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Quit it!"</p>

<p>"W-what?"</p>

<p>"Quit being dramatic. Be as nasty as you want to, but don't act
Lady Macbeth. Talk sense. Let's not play at murder-trial. I'm in
the business."</p>

<p>"Oh, I never hated you before, but when you get so smug, so
conceited, so fatuous&mdash;'I'm in the business'!"</p>

<p>"Dear love, you know I'm not fatuous&mdash;just clumsy. I'm
trying to be firm and convince you that I'm not going to tolerate
this philandering. Bradd is a closed case."</p>

<p>She was confused and almost meek in her retort of "Oh, you think
so, do you!" but she worked herself up into suitable wrath. She
punched a pillow and launched out:</p>

<p>"Do you usually try criminals without giving them a chance to
defend themselves? If Bradd were here, and you even dared to
<i>hint</i> at what you call his 'treachery,' he'd knock you
down."</p>

<p>"Sorry. He couldn't."</p>

<p>"And when you stood there like a prizefighter, with your manly
foot on his chest, you'd expect me to admire you?"</p>

<p>"Sweet, stop it. This has nothing to do with the fact that I
will not stand for Bradd."</p>

<p>"Then why tell <i>me</i>? Why don't you tell <i>him?</i> If
you're going to act the noble affronted husband, why don't you
<i>do</i> it? Make up your mind!"</p>

<p>He remarked, "All right." He crossed casually to the telephone.
He got Bradd, at the Avondenes', and said, "I wish you could drive
out here. It's quite important. I'll explain when you get
here."</p>

<p>During the half-hour while they waited, Cass and Jinny were
extremely civil. They said, Have you heard the war news? They said,
There's a hole burned in the rug in the sun-room. They said, I
don't think the furnace is giving the heat it ought to.</p>

<p>Bradd came in, snowy and smiling. Cass spoke to him with no
unusual expression in his voice:</p>

<p>"I wish you'd be careful in answering what I'm going to say,
Bradd, and not too touchy, because I don't want to lose your
friendship. It's been a valued possession for a great many
years."</p>

<p>"You sound serious, Jedge."</p>

<p>"Bradd, you're too attentive to Jinny. People are talking.
That's not so important to me as the fact that I'm thinking!"</p>

<p>"You mean to say&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes. You've gone beyond safe companionship with Jinny, but I
believe you can cut it out and we can be friendly again, instead of
a pretty silly and nasty triangle."</p>

<p>"What's suddenly started all this?"</p>

<p>"Being forced to admit what I already knew."</p>

<p>"You really believe that I have what the prudes call 'evil
intentions' toward Jinny?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"I said Yes."</p>

<p>"Really&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't think she has. But I think you have. Though I also
think that you've had so many affairs that you'll never be able to
feel very deeply about her or any other woman now."</p>

<p>Bradd rose quietly. "What proof have you of your
suspicions?"</p>

<p>"I didn't have any till this second, when you asked that
defensive question."</p>

<p>"You call that proof!"</p>

<p>"Bradd, don't be insulted, don't be a comedy villain. There's
too little love <i>or</i> friendship in life." He astonished Bradd,
he overwhelmed Jinny, and he considerably surprised himself by
grasping Bradd's arm, and urging, "I love her, and I'm fond of you.
I would have gone to you, instead of having the impertinence of
asking you to come here just to get bawled out, but I wanted Jinny
to know just what I really said. Don't say anything now. You must
decide whether you want to hate me or not. But if we three decent
people can't get along in honesty, then there's no hope for anybody
anywhere."</p>

<p>"Good night," Bradd said flatly, and, as he left them, for the
first time in twenty years, he looked confused.</p>

<p>Then Cass turned wearily to Jinny, and prepared to be
denounced.</p>

<p>She moved toward him shyly, and muttered, "You're so superior to
that fellow! I knew it all along, but I was just being stubborn. I
do love you, and he&mdash;he's yellow!"</p>

<p>"I don't know that I'd call him yellow. He's really a nice
man."</p>

<p>"'Nice' he ain't! I could tell you a lot of things about him
that you don't know. But the point is that you've gone and taken me
away from him again, as you do with all my beaux."</p>

<p>"Good!"</p>

<p>"And&mdash;uh&mdash;Cass, it never did go very far with Bradd
and me. Just sort of a careless kiss."</p>

<p>"I'm glad."</p>

<p>"<i>You're</i> glad? Gee, maybe I'm not! Sweet dear!"<br>
<br></p>

<p><b>An Assemblage of Husbands and Wives</b>
</p>

<p><i>Perry &amp; Bernice Claywheel</i>
</p>

<p>Perry Claywheel, superintendent of schools of Grand Republic and
president of its small Junior College, was an enterprising and
liberal educator. He fought to have the meager salaries of his
teachers increased, and every summer he read several books.</p>

<p>He admired and even liked his lily-pale consort, Bernice, but he
was almost impotent to make love to her, and they had no
children.</p>

<p>Bernice, that prim wanton, was no nymphomaniac. She said,
extraordinarily often, "I think All Those Things are too much
discussed." But she did have a normal longing for passion, and she
went shyly tripping to Dr. Drover.</p>

<p>"I'm sure you'll believe me, Doctor, when I tell you that I
entirely disapprove of immorality, and still more of showing bad
taste. But what can I do? My husband leaves me so dissatisfied that
sometimes I can't think of anything else, and I'm afraid I'll go
crazy. What do you advise?"</p>

<p>"Why don't you try to do your job right and get him interested?
You probably scare him off."</p>

<p>"You mean the arts of love?"</p>

<p>"Huh? Yuh, I guess you could call it that."</p>

<p>"To me, Doctor, that would be sordid, and unmodern, like a
slave-woman. I must have romance&mdash;all the beauty that the
movies make an effort to show. I deserve it! And if Perry can't
give it to me&mdash; It isn't that I want an 'affair,' but if I
don't have one, I'm afraid I'll go crazy. I feel so nervous. But if
I, uh, go with a man of my own social class, I'm afraid it will get
out, and honestly, I wouldn't want to jeopardize my husband's
important position. And if I picked up some common person, I'd be
terrified of blackmail. Tell me, Doctor&mdash;I'm dreadfully
ashamed to even ask this, but are there&mdash;uh&mdash;places where
women can go, as there are places where men go?"</p>

<p>"No! Besides, I don't know what you're talking about. That's a
problem you'll have to work out by yourself," snapped the virtuous
Dr. Drover.</p>

<p>Both Bernice and Dr. Drover regarded themselves as persons who
had learned the facts of life.</p>

<p>When she was in this wretched way of feeling, she took some
papers for her husband to Bradd Criley. It was late in the
afternoon, a rainy October afternoon, and Mr. Criley's stenographer
had gone. He remembered, with surprise, that just then he had no
affair on whatever, except for an interest in Jinny Timberlane
which that fractious girl had never permitted to go beyond
flirtation. He looked at Bernice and thought how lovely she was,
shining in the putrescent autumn light. He led her to the leather
couch and kissed her.</p>

<p>Even with his professional experience, he was surprised by the
way in which she instantly went to pieces. She cried "Oh!" and
almost smothered him with her reaching arms, and seemed about to
eat him up. "Is she hot!" he thought.</p>

<p>They met half a dozen times in a month, and he told
himself&mdash; indeed, he rather hinted to his friend Dr.
Drover&mdash;that he was a public benefactor. Bernice asked him
whether they were "really doing the right thing," and he assured
her&mdash;at first&mdash;that it was "necessary for her
health."</p>

<p>What began to bore him, what made him cut the affair off even
more quickly than usual, was the fact that Bernice kept moaning,
"Oh, lover, we oughtn't to be doing this to Perry."</p>

<p>"Where do you get that 'we'?" he protested, first to himself but
presently to her, and she wept enough, she acted badly enough, so
that he was able to break it off with quite a show of
indignation.</p>

<p>Now Perry Claywheel had been convincing himself that he was
becoming a better lover, recently. There was a teacher, not too
young, who thought fairly well of him&mdash;not that they did
anything really wrong, you understand.</p>

<p>On the night after Bernice's first visit to Bradd, Perry had
turned to her, in their golden-oak double bed, with a slight quiver
of rapture, but she had said sharply, "Oh, not tonight. Anyway,
it's not good for you."</p>

<p>He protested that it <i>was</i> good for him, and that he longed
for her, and as she continued to refuse him, with more and more
resentment, as though he were a preposterous stranger, he could
think of nothing but his desire to be with her. He trembled with a
conceptive agony that, in his humiliation, was not uncolored with
madness.</p>

<p>He did not try to persuade her again. However he might long for
her imaginatively, in her presence he became powerless. He had a
shameful feeling that he was not quite a man, that his failure was
incurable.</p>

<p>He was afraid of her, though he still wanted her to think of him
as a possible lover for some time in the future, when she should
have got over this curious triumphant mood of hers, which he could
not understand. Looking about Grand Republic, he suspected that
many husbands were afraid of their wives, quiveringly trying to
placate those small tyrants. He wondered if there was any country
save America in which a large share of the men were frightened
continuously by their own wives.</p>

<p>With all this, he became irritable at school, snapping at the
teachers, accusing the pupils, and he no longer enjoyed the
intellectual card-cataloging and small prides of his job. He just
did not enjoy anything, not even the sight of Bernice and her
beauty, for she was suddenly changing, and becoming drab and
hesitant, uninteresting even to the young men who delivered
groceries and with whom she had once laughed in the kitchen.</p>

<p>When Bernice finally hinted to him that she was willing to
return to his embraces, he said bleakly that he had no longer any
desire. But he never knew what he owed to Bradd Criley, a man well
spoken of for his geniality.</p>

<h2>Chapter 41</h2>

<p>Mr. Boone Havock, with Mr. Bradd Criley, his attorney, was
attendant in the chambers of Judge Timberlane, in the matter of an
injunction against the Sequoia &amp; Hematite R.R.</p>

<p>The Judge and Mr. Criley, though they addressed each other by
their first names, were so excessively courteous that Mr. Havock
protested, "You boys are awful polite and helpful to each other
today. What's trouble? Been having a row?"</p>

<p>Bradd looked to Cass for a statement which might determine their
relationship for many years, and Cass said thoughtfully, "Bradd is
my friend, and you can't row with a friend. You might murder him,
but you couldn't hurt him. If he did have any faults&mdash;no, if a
man is your friend, he <i>has</i> no faults; he merely has
oversights that you know he'll correct when he gets around to it.
That's true, don't you think, Bradd?"</p>

<p>"I hope it is&mdash;I'm sure it is!"</p>

<p>"God Almighty, you boys getting so noble on me about friendship!
You're lucky you ain't in the contracting business! And since
you're so het up about friendship, Cass, strikes me you been
neglecting your old friends, the Havocks, pretty bad, the past six
months. It's that wife of yours&mdash;elegant girl but God-awful
snooty. Does she let you in under the rope, Bradd?"</p>

<p>"We're on quite civil terms, I think. She is a very fine
woman."</p>

<p>"I guess too fine for us lumberjacks. She's got every right to
her opinions, but don't let her take you away from us, Cass. We
kind of need you around."</p>

<p>Cass was so inept at the higher lying that he could only get
back to the injunction. When they had finished and Boone was gone,
Cass dropped his hand on Bradd's shoulder and said, with no
particular emphasis, "We want you to come to Christmas dinner. Very
much."</p>

<p>"You're sure of it?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I'd like to. I'll come and be glad to. And&mdash;Look, Cass.
I'm never going to say another word about this, but you did
exaggerate my feeling toward Jinny. If I was at fault it was just
the 'oversight' you were speaking of. I have so much respect for
Jinny's integrity and so much appreciation of her humor that I
showed it in a way that, I see now, might have been mistaken for a
quite improper ardor. But nobody knows better than I do that she
<i>is</i> your wife. No, no, don't say anything; I just wanted to
make myself clear, and I hope that now we three can be friends
again. Good night, ole man. Christmas dinner at three?"<br>
<br></p>

<p>Everything was normal and beautiful with this happy young
couple, the Timberlanes, now, and there was obviously no reason why
their heavenly bliss should not last forever.</p>

<p>Jinny was "taking care of herself"; she got nine hours of sleep,
covered as warmly as the doctor advised, she eschewed pastry and
looked with sniffs upon more than one cocktail a week. She welcomed
Cass to her bed, and wound her arms about his tingling shoulders,
and they so rejoiced again in bodily love that they even saw the
cosmically bawdy humor in it.</p>

<p>As much as Cass, the reticent Jinny was offended by indecencies,
yet she did see that it was demoralizingly funny when the
embarrassed young Cass came in expectantly and had to be told that
he and his poetic ardor were barred by the lunar rhythm.</p>

<p>She jeered at him then, but tenderly, and revealed the esoteric
fact that every woman somehow expects her man to guess that obvious
crisis without being told. He lay beside her, his cheek just
touching her bare shoulder, and they laughed and were divinely
content; the world shut out, the Bradd Crileys shut out, the Boone
Havocks shut out, and the dusty court room and the bitter Northern
winter and the ghastly speed with which, after you are twenty-five,
the whole good day is only one hour long.</p>

<p>They were so commendable. Pricked by Boone's protest, they had
the Havocks and the Drovers and the Brightwings and the Reverend
Gadds and the Prutts in for dinner. It wasn't really so hard, you
know; Jinny's diabetes gave Cass an excuse to invite their guests
to go home at ten o'clock.</p>

<p>Their Christmas was as hearty as though no war existed.</p>

<p>They drank lingeringly to all their friends in peril abroad, but
then, as every civilian far enough from the battle has done in
every war since Troy, they forgot it, and sang carols.<br>
<br></p>

<p>Any strain that might be left over between Bradd and the
Timberlanes was wiped out in early January, when Bradd came in to
say quietly that he was going to New York to live, permanently.</p>

<p>The Wargate Corporation had bought several plants in New England
and New Jersey for its war materials: packing cases, wallboard for
barracks, glider bodies, propellers, hulls. They had offices in New
York; might even, in some day catastrophic for Grand Republic, move
their headquarters there; and in New York they needed Bradd as
legal adviser.</p>

<p>He said evenly, "I hate to say good-bye so informally&mdash;I
think of you two as my dearest friends&mdash;but there's a case on,
and I have to grab a train tomorrow morning. My stuff will be sent
on after me, when I get an apartment in New York. And I have to
hustle over to Webb Wargate's now. We have a conference that'll
take half the night. So good-bye, and come see me in New York, soon
as you can. I'll paint the town for you. And you have a perfectly
swell husband, Jinny!"</p>

<p>He shook Cass's hand, he hastily kissed Jinny, and he was
gone.</p>

<h2>Chapter 42</h2>

<p>He admitted that he had lied to himself in asserting that she
had settled down to contentment with housewifery and bridge and
dinners and the Red Cross. When they came home from parties they
laughed as intimately together and as domestically about their
fellow-guests as those guests were then doing about them, and at
such a time Grand Republic seemed world enough for her.</p>

<p>Yet she was curiously older. In no feature, not in her throat or
her eyes or mouth, could you detect the minute signs of aging, but
April was gone. She did not complain. Indeed, when he made the
husbandly inquiry, "Are you happy?" she was impatient: "Of course I
am. Why shouldn't I be?"</p>

<p>If she was not content, she put up with life, in a static,
plodding way. She was only bored when, with that circular
conversation of matrimony, the same ideas coming up as bright new
ones over and over, he again hinted that she ought to do a little
more war work, a little more drawing.</p>

<p>He sighed that he and his cursed domestication had killed so
much of that part of her that was peculiarly Jinny Timberlane, and
to no end, since he was no more satisfied with three meals in a day
colored only by a little passion than she was.</p>

<p>Did all people, everywhere, drift thus into a not-quite-painful
dullness? Was it merely the way of the world? Well, if it was, he
raged, he would change that world. He would pack up Jinny and Mrs.
Higbee and Cleo and Isis and his Nonesuch edition of Dickens and
flee.</p>

<p>Where?</p>

<p>That was but one mood. Most of the time, he was at ease as
husband and judge. But the twisted mood did come, oftener and
oftener.<br>
<br></p>

<p>Jinny had a letter or two from Bradd, in February. She read them
aloud to Cass, and apparently she left nothing out.</p>

<p>"Am now one of the dizziest members of cafe society, and can
read menus backwards. Have learned that Boeuf de Dijon en Casserole
means Irish Stew, and how to answer the waiters, etc., in my best
Gr. Rep. French, 'No soap.'"</p>

<p>"He writes clever letters," said Cass.</p>

<p>She sniffed. "Oh, I think they're silly."</p>

<p>He thought so too, and he was much comforted.</p>

<p>"How about a little chess, Jin?"</p>

<p>"I'd just love it."</p>

<p>He was worried. When she just-loved chess, a game which has been
truly mastered by no woman since Queen Elizabeth, she was hiding
things.</p>

<p>His resolve had been subterraneanly forming for two years, but
it came to a climax irrelevantly, when he was on the bench during
the drawing of a jury.</p>

<p>&mdash;My Jinny is going to die, unless I do something to save
her. She'll wither and become an old woman early and die. It's more
psychic than bodily, her slow fading, no matter what Roy says. I
<i>will</i> do something.</p>

<p>Only his mechanical judicial mind heard the lawyers. After
court, he hastened home in a panic. With his overcoat scarce off,
he held her shoulders, looked at her beseechingly, and
insisted:</p>

<p>"You aren't getting much out of living the way we do, <i>are</i>
you? Tell me really. I think it's a perfectly good way, but perhaps
it isn't for some people. Don't be heroic or sacrificing. We can do
almost anything you want to. Tell me how you feel."</p>

<p>He had spoken without any of the standard domestic questioning,
and she answered honestly, "I am getting kind of bored."</p>

<p>"What would you like us to do? I don't care what it
is&mdash;growing ice-cubes in Greenland."</p>

<p>"Well, sometimes I've wished you were practising law in
Minneapolis, or maybe you could be a judge there, still better.
Could you?"</p>

<p>"Not for quite a while, anyway. Have to be elected judge, you
know. But to go back to practising law&mdash;" He sighed. "That
would be all right. Might even be exciting. More competition.
Minneapolis would be fine. You'd, uh, you'd like it better than
Grand Republic?"</p>

<p>"There are too many memories here: Eino and my Emily, and poor
Jinny before she got sick&mdash;she used to be so excited, such a
fool! And there's so little to do here, not even any good
restaurants, and in the evening, you can go to a movie&mdash;or not
go to a movie. But Minneapolis&mdash;gracious, a huge city like
that&mdash;restaurants and the University and all kinds of art
galleries and everything! Even a real show right from New York,
sometimes. All sorts of wonderful things. You're sure you couldn't
get transferred as a judge?"</p>

<p>"No, it's a different judicial district. And the chances are
about a hundred to one of my not being elected there, if I ever
resigned here."</p>

<p>"You asked me to be frank, and I was, and now I want you to be.
You do love the dignity of being a judge, <i>don't</i> you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but I love it less than I do you."</p>

<p>"Would it be hard to take up practising again?"</p>

<p>"Well, the commercial end, especially the grabbing off of other
people's clients, would be unpleasant. But what would I care about
remaining a judge if I lost you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, you'll never lose me! I'll always stick. You haven't a
chance. And you would really do this for me, if I wanted
to&mdash;move to Minneapolis?"</p>

<p>"I certainly would. Only, why Minneapolis? If we <i>are</i>
going to tackle a more metropolitan place, why not Chicago? Or New
York?"</p>

<p>"New York terrified me. I think it did you."</p>

<p>"Look, lamb, if Bradd Criley can make a go of it there, I
can!"</p>

<p>"Ye-es&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm at least as good a lawyer as he is&mdash;with all apologies
to your friend, maybe I'm a little better." He realized that he was
betraying a jealousy of Bradd for daring to invade Megalopolis, and
he went on more mildly: "I mean, we ought to thank Bradd for
showing us the way. We don't have to be Westerners with lariats
unless we want to! I don't have to hold court on horseback, and you
can come out of the sod hut. We'll pick up New York and shake
it."</p>

<p>"Oh, but that headwaiter at the Marmoset Club, with eyes like a
wet old dishrag, who looks at you just once and guesses exactly
what your income is, and do you know any Astors."</p>

<p>"Maybe we'd get to know a few Class B Astors, if we wanted to,
which I doubt."</p>

<p>"I'd love to know <i>lots</i> of Astors&mdash;big fat juicy
ones, and little diamond-studded ones in sables!"</p>

<p>&mdash;She hasn't been so gay in weeks. My idea was right.</p>

<p>"Jinny, you shall have all the Astors you want. Have Astors with
your corn flakes."</p>

<p>"And cream."</p>

<p>"And extra cream, from the Ritz. God knows even a very rich
Astor or Vanderbilt or Morgan, one nine feet tall with a robe made
of securities, couldn't be more chilly than our local John William
Prutts. Let's look their lodge over. I mean, before we actually
decide whether I ever shall resign, I think we ought to go to New
York and study it, to see whether, if we had a real home of our own
there, we wouldn't enjoy the place."</p>

<p>"And Cleo?"</p>

<p>"Naturally."</p>

<p>Jinny thought it over and said seriously, "And I guess we'd have
to take Mrs. Higbee, too, if she'd come. I do get a little tired of
her dumplings, but she's the only one we could trust to walk
Cleo."</p>

<p>He laughed. "You're already beginning to think of New York as
possible."</p>

<p>"Maybe I am. And I imagine that if you did step down from the
bench and had to stand looking up at some other old meanie sitting
there, you'd rather have it farther away than Minneapolis."</p>

<p>"Possibly."</p>

<p>"You'll get used to being down in the prize-ring again. Beat 'em
all up! After all, a referee doesn't have as much fun as the
scrappers...Oh, Cass, shall we really try New York?"</p>

<p>"Yes, we'll go see what legal openings there are."<br>
<br></p>

<p>He pondered, not for the first time, that she did not really
comprehend what it would mean to him to give up the honor of his
judgeship and his belief that in some minute way he was guarding
the rights of man, adding to the eternal code of justice. She had
not complained about it, but she had never altogether understood
why he was willing to take far less in salary than the fees he
could make as a practitioner. He remembered that when she had
visited his court room, she had been considerably less stirred by
the finality of his "'Jection 'stained" than by Bradd's insinuating
address to the jury.</p>

<p>He wondered whether today, as women more and more took on
professions of their own, wives in general were less interested in
their husbands' work; whether their ears wandered from the men's
shop-talk as their eyes wandered from the marriage-bed. Was the
sanctity of the profession, to be followed for a lifetime, for many
generations, and rarely to be thrown over for a "better-paying
job," vanishing from society along with the sanctity of the single
family?</p>

<p>It frightened him.<br>
<br></p>

<p>Judges Blackstaff and Flaaten were annoyed when Judge Timberlane
wanted to run off to New York for a week during the busy court days
of early February. But Roy Drover was annoying.</p>

<p>"Going to see our old friend Bradd there?" he hinted.</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>"Your wife going to see him, too?"</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"I wouldn't know. Probably I'm wrong, so please excuse me for
living."</p>

<h2>Chapter 43</h2>

<p>Bradd Criley met their train in New York. He was wearing a black
camel's-hair coat and a black Homburg; he who had edified Grand
Republic with plaid overcoats and a green hunting-hat with a
feather. With Jinny, as with Cass, he merely shook hands.</p>

<p>Naturally, Cass had reserved a suite at that only hotel, the
Melchester, but Bradd cried, "Oh, I meant to warn you. I used to
think the Melchester was a good joint, but now I realize that
nobody but Middlewesterners stay there. I wish I could put you up
at my flat, but I have just the one bedroom. Maybe I can get you
accommodations at the Gayling. The manager there is a good friend
of mine."</p>

<p>"We'll be all right. Only be here six-seven days," said
Cass.</p>

<p>If their suite at the Melchester was not the same as the one
they had had before, it was even more so, more white-paneled and
chaste and monastic. Isis was again set on the windowsill, to see
New York. Jinny flushed over worshiping the crystal toy, and turned
to Cass with "I <i>am</i> silly, I know!"</p>

<p>It was the last time during their stay when he saw her as
youthful.</p>

<p>That evening, by the arrangement of Bradd and in Bradd's phrase,
they "painted the town red." They went to one restaurant and three
night-clubs, and in each place had the same table and the same
waiter and the same drinks and the same waiting for their bill and
the same excessiveness in the bill when they did get it, and on the
whole, if the taxicabs were expensive, still, it did not take them
much longer to go three blocks by taxi than to have walked.</p>

<p>In each miniature heaven, Bradd introduced them to the same man,
only sometimes this man was fat and had a girl, and sometimes he
was thin and had a toupee&mdash;and a girl. They all drank, and
Cass felt dull. He probably was.</p>

<p>He explained that he was thinking of practising law here. Bradd
sounded doubtful:</p>

<p>"Of course you're a swell lawyer, much sounder than I am, but
it's hard for me to see you either in a limousine or the subway.
You like walking home through the snow too much. Me, I'm a
chameleon. I may yet wind up as a tenor. It's only the fact that
the Wargates and Boone have always backed me that has kept me from
being an ambulance-chaser."</p>

<p>He looked at Jinny, and her eyes said that he was too modest.
"So I can switch from the slow pace of Grand Republic to this
hundred-and-four-degree fever tempo of New York and not get
nervous. You study a guy for a long time before you accept him as a
friend, but I can pick up a hundred new people in a day, and drop
'em just as quickly. God knows it would be wonderful to have you
here, but I think you ought to go kind of slow about deciding."</p>

<p>They all became more or less drunk, and Cass could not remember
whether, at parting, Bradd kissed Jinny or not.<br>
<br></p>

<p>She slept long after Cass had awakened, next morning, and he was
touched by the pleasant sight of her: rosy and half-smiling, with
her left index finger clasped in her right hand. Over his solitary
coffee, in the parlor of their suite, he saw himself back in a law
office, bargaining, arranging, advising, tactfully welcoming new
business...There was a long table, and on it the files about a
client with a temper and a red-veined nose, and beside it that
client himself, and Counselor Timberlane was about to lose his
lucrative but distasteful business by advising him that you really
can't sue for the possession of property merely because you like
the view from it&mdash;</p>

<p>A tap, and Bradd came in, in a gray overcoat and a new gray hat
and a red chrysanthemum, but closing his eyes in pain.</p>

<p>"Have I got a hang-over!" he moaned. "Were you wise to only
drink half as much as I did, last evening! Hope I'm not butting in,
but I was too high last evening to make any real plans for us
today."</p>

<p>Cass had not known that Bradd <i>was</i> to make plans for
them.</p>

<p>"The lady awake yet?"</p>

<p>"The lady is awake but I'm not sure she's alive!" floated from
the bedroom, and Jinny weaved in, much too pretty in her negligee.
She shook hands with Bradd as though they were rival
undertakers.</p>

<p>He had coffee with them, and suddenly he was no gilded New
Yorker but one of the hometown boys, ready to trade all the shops
on Madison Avenue for the lint-smelling aisles of The Tarr
Emporium.</p>

<p>"I was kind of pie-eyed and boastful, last evening," Bradd
grumbled. "Oh, I <i>have</i> met a lot of people here, almost as
many as I claimed, but I'm still lonely, and am I glad to see you!
I haven't anybody here who's a hundredth as close to me as you two
are&mdash;nobody whose house I'd drop into uninvited, except my
sister's place, way out in Darien. I go out there for week-ends,
and Avis is a grand woman, but she is rather sot in her ways. Oh,
I'm making a lot of social contacts that will be invaluable later,
but I haven't got anybody, male <i>or</i> female, that I can knock
around with.</p>

<p>"If you're free, I can take the whole day off. Can't you put off
seeing prospects for twenty-four hours, Cass? Oh, see if you can't
rig it. We'll lunch at the Plaza, and then take a taxi up and look
over Grant's Tomb. You always hear about all the visiting firemen
going up there, but I never met anybody that has. Maybe Grant's no
longer there. He may have left in a huff. We ought to find out, and
tell the Associated Press.</p>

<p>"Then we'll have dinner early, at a Hindu place I know of,
wonderful curries, and go to a show, Oklahoma. Avis will come in
town and join us&mdash;I've already phoned her&mdash;and I have
four tickets already. Got 'em by almost you might say a fluke.
They're absolutely impossible to get, show is a sell-out, but the
agent is a great friend of mine; he said to me, 'Mr. Criley, I
wouldn't let anybody else have these tickets, not if it was the
President of the United States.'</p>

<p>"So come on, Cass; let's you and I and the girl take the day off
and be fancy-free. Time enough to act serious tomorrow. Just say
the word and I'll phone my office."</p>

<p>"Bradd, I'm sorry as the dickens, but I have dates with
law-firms all day long. Why don't you two skip off together, and
I'll meet you and Avis for dinner?"</p>

<p>Bradd seemed entirely cheerful about this desertion. "Just as
you say, Boss. I'll squire the lady around and get her back here
fairly early and have Avis meet us all here at seven. Be sure and
be on time, so we won't miss any of the show, and be
dressed&mdash;Got your Tux along? Good! I know most of these New
Yorkers aren't dressing for the theater, in wartime, but we'll show
'em the kind of speed we're used to in Grand Republic! Be sure and
be all ready by seven, so we can have a leisurely dinner. You'll
appreciate that cocoanut soup."</p>

<p>"Do I get asked about any of this?" demanded Jinny.</p>

<p>"You do. Do you?" said Bradd.</p>

<p>"I do," said Jinny. They laughed&mdash;they two.</p>

<p>Cass croaked, "Well, I got to get started, I'm afraid. Shame I
got these engagements."</p>

<p>That was at ten A.M.</p>

<p>At five minutes after ten, Cass went down in the elevator. He
had no engagements whatever.</p>

<p>He was ashamed of his suspicions, but he could not help it; he
sat in the lobby, in a niche behind a petrified palm, waiting to
see when Bradd and Jinny would leave.</p>

<p>Not till this morning had it occurred to the simple husband
that, after his warnings about treachery, his wife and Bradd could
possibly continue to intrigue against his peace and decency. But he
had seen Bradd looking at her in her negligee, he had seen flying
between them the glances that do not need words for a body.</p>

<p>He saw them skip through the lobby and out to a taxicab at ten
minutes to twelve.</p>

<p>She was in a gray suit with a yellow sweater as lively as a
fiesta. She looked, to his sensitized mind, three years younger
than when she had left Grand Republic three days ago. She was rosy
and excited, and the shadows of her illness and Emily's death and
middle-class boredom seemed lifted from her by a new light.</p>

<p>&mdash;If that fellow has such a good effect on her, and if I
really love her as much as I claim I do, I ought to hand her over
to him, even if he doesn't want me to&mdash;even if <i>she</i>
doesn't!</p>

<p>&mdash;No! The improvement in her is just travel. She'd go out
quite as cheerfully with Greg Marl or Lloyd Gadd.</p>

<p>&mdash;But Bradd isn't like them. He can really be evil. There
are a few people that actually are evil. He's no good.</p>

<p>&mdash;Don't fool yourself, my friend. That's what makes him
dangerous. Women love wolves and heels, the way decent men often
love insinuating little tarts. And women will sacrifice anything
for their compliments&mdash;and for their embraces. Real
witchcraft. To think that Jinny, who's been clean as a doe in a
forest, could stand the bog that Bradd loves to wallow in.</p>

<p>&mdash;I won't think that way about either of them!</p>

<p>&mdash;I wonder where he stayed in our suite while she was
dressing?</p>

<p>&mdash;Oh, shame, Cass!<br>
<br></p>

<p>He telephoned and made engagements to see the heads of several
law firms. Then he had a horrible afternoon of sitting in Georgian
waiting-rooms, dens of knowledge and of contempt, where from the
tops of classical bookcases the busts of Cicero and Judas Maccabeus
and Roger Taney looked down at him and denied that he could ever
have been a congressman or a judge. What had he come in with&mdash;
samples? Where was the briefcase?</p>

<p>When he finally talked with the Heads, they were less chummy
than the plaster busts. They were looking for office boys, not
partners.</p>

<p>He lunched by himself at an Automat, remembering how in better
days Jinny had loved the magic doors which opened on mince pies. At
five he went by himself to a newsreel, and in the war scenes he saw
only the faces of Bradd and Jinny and heard only, "Can't you let
the poor girl enjoy herself?"</p>

<p>He was back at the hotel at six-fifteen. Jinny had not returned.
He was dressed at six-thirty-five, and trying to find the Dick
Tracy comic strip in the confusing New York newspapers, which
didn't have even the Weather Report in the right place.</p>

<p>Bradd's sister Avis&mdash;the refined Mrs. William Elderman of
New York and Darien&mdash;telephoned up from the lobby at
six-fifty-nine, came in, in rich apparel, looked all over the room
(fourteen by sixteen) and said accusingly, "Why, Bradd isn't
<i>here!</i>"</p>

<p>She obliquely let him know that she was not accustomed to being
dragged into town like this for every stray tramp from Minnesota.
They made talk and looked at each other resentfully, while Cass
peeped at his heavy pocket-watch, Avis at her tiny curved
wrist-watch. They were increasingly nervous as Time jumped from
seven-fifteen to seven-thirty to seven-forty-five to
eight&mdash;</p>

<p>"But where <i>are</i> they?" observed Avis.</p>

<p>At ten minutes after eight, Jinny and Bradd whisked in, very
gay. They must have stopped at Bradd's apartment, for he was now in
dinner-clothes. Certainly they had had cocktails.</p>

<p>Jinny rejoiced, "My, I'm afraid we're late&mdash;most awfully
sorry&mdash; I'll hustle and change&mdash;like a rabbit-hound!"
From the bedroom she could be heard as she dressed, in no especial
haste.</p>

<p>Bradd said innocently, "Do forgive us, Sister&mdash;Cass. I know
we're horribly late, but we got to talking and laughing about the
Prutts and Queenie Havock, and we didn't realize how late it was
getting to be." Then, boyishly and sweetly, "Guess I was sort of
homesick for local gossip."</p>

<p>They had a feverishly gulping dinner and missed part of the
play, which offended Judge Timberlane's principles of art and of
economy equally. And Avis rather spoke about this, later, when they
sat at the Marmoset, since she had "gone and taken the trouble to
come clear in from Darien, <i>really!</i>" In Cass's brain was a
pulse beating, "Be careful or you'll lose her&mdash;be
careful&mdash;you'll lose her&mdash;be careful."</p>

<p>While Bradd was being sardonic about the audience at the play,
who were people very much like Bradd Criley, Cass's head went on
beating, "They certainly weren't trying to hide anything, when they
came in an hour late! They trust me not to be a jealous maniac.
I'll show that I trust <i>them!</i>"</p>

<p>He blurted, "I'll have to be seeing law-firms again, all day
tomorrow. Suppose you could entertain Jinny, Bradd, or are you
busy?"</p>

<p>"I'd feel honored to elope with the lady, but I'll be rushed
with work all day," said Bradd; and Jinny, "Matter fact, I'll be
rushed myself. Be at the hair-dresser's most of the time."</p>

<p>Cass was so pleased by their casualness that he barely noticed
it when Bradd went on, "But maybe I could snatch just a few
minutes, Jin, and grab a quick sandwich with you for lunch," and
she, with equal indifference, answered, "We'll see. Call me at the
hair-dresser's&mdash;Madame Lorraine's."</p>

<p>The thunderstorm was over, the sky cleared, the birds
twittering. Even Avis, after two highballs, was sunny, and told
them about her first grandchild. She was proud of having one at her
age of forty-five, as though it was something special and foxy and
quite unsuburban that she had done. At midnight, Bradd put her into
a taxicab and returned boisterously.</p>

<p>They moved on to the Jive Hive and there sat or danced till
three, and Cass did not suggest their going home, for he was
fascinated as Bradd, swiftly drinking, turned into the complete and
obvious satyr, and Jinny clearly did not mind. She was excited when
by black art, before their eyes, the good housedog, the faithful
spaniel, was transformed into an amorous werewolf.</p>

<p>In the 1940's, not even the machines for destroying lives and
cities were more ingeniously developed than the novelties in the
American vocabulary. The ancient four-letter words pertaining to
generation and digestion were brought from the garden fence to the
Junior Misses' schoolroom, and in the lower reaches of etymology,
there was also a treasury of new labels for the sort of male once
described with relish as "an agreeable scoundrel." He could now be
referred to not merely as a cad or a bounder, but as a heel, a
drip, a punk, a lug, a jerk, a louse, a stinker, a rat, a twirp, a
crumb, or a goon. There were exquisite distinctions among the
precise meanings of these words, but most of them were allied to
"wolf," the contemporary term for a confirmed seducer or amateur
pimp, a type well thought of at the time.</p>

<p>Meditatively considering these terms, Cass decided that his old
friend Bradd was a heel, a stinker, a rat, and a wolf.<br>
<br></p>

<p>Bradd was, as he became drunk, most whimsical and prankish. He
spoke to the waiter in a gibberish which he explained as Modern
Persian. He thought it was amusing to steal a silver teaspoon.</p>

<p>He told the Timberlanes just enough of his affair with Bernice
Claywheel to give himself a reek of sexual potency. He picked up an
anonymous, damply pretty woman at the bar, brought her to their
table, told her that he was a renowned Los Angeles psychiatrist,
and treated her dipsomania by pouring so many highballs into her
that she went off and was sick in the women's toilet.</p>

<p>When Jinny was definitely not amused, Bradd's round face cleared
to a look of sober and engaging youthfulness, and he confided, "I
ought to apologize to you for kidding that poor sot, but remember
I'm a prairie hick, and I can't resist showing up these
sophisticated New Yorkers. Cass, doesn't it seem incredible that
that slattern and our lovely Jinny belong to the same female
sex?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;incredible&mdash;well go home now,
Jinny."</p>

<p>In the taxicab, when Cass growled, "Bradd acted like a
hobbledehoy," she snapped, "Oh, don't be so picky! He never acts
like a judge, if that's what you mean. He loves fun and
adventure."</p>

<p>When with long yawns they had reached their bedroom, they
undressed in verbal darkness. Cass got what solace he could from
the fact that Jinny and he would have dinner by themselves tomorrow
evening.</p>

<h2>Chapter 44</h2>

<p>Mr. Crossbow of Crossbow, Murphy and Thane, in which firm Cass's
classmate, Dennis Thane, was a partner, was born in Yankton, South
Dakota. He thought highly of Middlewestern men and of the Minnesota
judiciary; he said Yes, he believed arrangements could be made for
Judge Timberlane to join their firm; in fact, they would be
honored.</p>

<p>Cass walked a mile up Broadway from Pine Street, out of the
district of gold certificates and steamship tickets, dazed that he
should have chosen to make his home in this wilderness where
grizzlies prowled all night and rattlers lurked all day. He was at
once homesick for the stillness of Dead Squaw Lake and proud that
he might some day be a millionaire, invited out to Long Island
palaces where each guest had three bathrooms.</p>

<p>&mdash;Let's see. Jinny wouldn't care for the suburbs. Probably
get an apartment on Park Avenue. Maybe on the river. Be interesting
to watch the boats&mdash;I guess.</p>

<p>He was to meet her at the hotel at six-thirty. They were to dine
together, and he rejoicingly had two good seats for Berg Nord's new
play.</p>

<p>He pictured himself rushing in to her with the news. That
morning he had merely mentioned the voodoo word "diabetes," and she
had sworn that she would be back at the hotel by five, and have a
nap.</p>

<p>&mdash;We won't overdo it tonight. We won't even go backstage
and see Berg. I'll send her to bed by half-past-eleven.</p>

<p>She was not in the suite when he arrived. He sat waiting for her
till twenty minutes past seven. When she came in, tired and blank,
he controlled himself, but the excitement and surprise had gone out
of his news and he said methodically, "Well, looks as if we really
can stay in New York. I can get a partnership with a good firm. All
we have to decide now is when I resign from the bench. Do you want
to come here before this summer, or wait till fall, when it'll
be&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No!" She looked secret and unhappy as she interrupted him. "I
don't want you to give up being a judge. I can't do that to you,
too."</p>

<p>"How do you mean? <i>Too?</i>"</p>

<p>"Oh, just generally disappointing you."</p>

<p>"You haven't. You couldn't!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Cass, don't do it! Take me home&mdash;tomorrow, if you can.
Please give up this whole idea. I know you couldn't be happy,
practising here, and then how could _I_ be happy? I was so stupid
and didn't realize, but when I see how you writhe&mdash;and you
should; they're so incredibly packed and vulgar&mdash;how you hate
these night-clubs, and even the streets, that are so tall and no
trees, then I know you mustn't do it. Let's go back <i>now!</i> I
will try to be satisfied, and I'm sure I can be, now I know how
fast and noisy this place is."</p>

<p>"Of course if we lived here quietly, in a nice flat, like most
New Yorkers&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no, no! I want security&mdash;and our home&mdash;and Cleo.
Please!"</p>

<p>"You scarcely have to coax me! Of course that's what I want,
too. But tomorrow?"</p>

<p>"Tonight, if we only could!"<br>
<br></p>

<p>That evening he was able to get, for the two of them, one single
upper berth on a minor railroad to Chicago, for the next day. He
telephoned to his putative new partners, Mr. Crossbow and Mr.
Dennis Thane, at their homes, that he would not be able to join
their firm. They both said that he had "let them down," but Cass,
to whom such an accusation would normally have been occasion for
alarm, scarcely heard them.</p>

<p>He was too busy to ask Jinny what she had been doing all
day.</p>

<p>"I think we can still make our show, all right," he said
happily. (Aspens gentle by the Sorshay River!) "Want us to have
some fun, our last evening here. It will be the last for quite a
while, I guess."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;see Cousin Berg&mdash;" she said feebly.</p>

<p>But he went on conscientiously, "Or do you think we ought to
give up the show and spend the time with Bradd?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't think that's necessary. We've seen a good deal of
him. Can't we just telephone him?"</p>

<p>He liked that very much. "Sure. I'll try him now."</p>

<p>He did not reach Bradd till after the play, to which he was not
very attentive, so swelling was he with thought of the coming
spring back home, when the top of their blue spruce would be dotted
with red buds, like a tiny Christmas tree, the mountain ash starred
with white, and the earth-smell sharply clean from Northern
rivulets. People here could not understand how proud and separate
was his land, nor how completely it drew him back, with no regrets
for the heathen wonders of Broadway.</p>

<p>He had Bradd on the telephone at midnight, and said
apologetically, "Well, despite all we could do to entertain her,
Jinny has decided she wants to go home. Looks as if I wouldn't hook
up with any law firm here, for a while at least."</p>

<p>"Won't I see you before you go?" Bradd sounded regretful but not
inconsolable.</p>

<p>"Afraid not, till the next visit, but we hope you'll be coming
out home soon."</p>

<p>"You bet, Cass; soon as I can."</p>

<p>"Jinny will be wanting to say good-bye now...Here you are,
Jin."</p>

<p>She was cordial enough, but so impersonal that Cass was pleased:
"Good-bye, Bradd, my dear. It's been fun having you show us around.
You're the real rubber-neck-wagon guide! Sorry we won't see you,
but I feel a little sick and bothered now&mdash;you know&mdash;New
York is so big&mdash;or so I hear! Some day I'll write you, if I
don't get too busy with the spring gardening. Good-bye!"<br>
<br></p>

<p>The one flaw was that next morning, when they were packing, they
found that the crystal Isis had disappeared. They searched the two
rooms, they looked under the twin beds, they summoned the
chambermaid, the housekeeper, but they did not find it.</p>

<p>Jinny never saw again the little shining talisman which she had
loved so youthfully, so long. She sat crying, her face against her
thin arm.<br>
<br></p>

<p>All afternoon and evening, in the club car, he learned the
strangest things about Wisconsin cheese and haddock-liver oil and
the percentages of grades in the Rocky Mountains, from the
indigenous magazines. Jinny was in a mood so sacred that he dared
not speak to her. She sat covered with silence as with a veil,
hands collapsed but eyes roving sightlessly. It was evident that
she was trying to decide something that had to be swallowed with a
gulp or spit out angrily.</p>

<p>They had to sleep in the one upper berth; they who had not
shared a bed all night for many months. Cass was as embarrassed and
guilty and yet excited about it as if they had never yet shared a
bed at all. She would undress up there by herself; he would shuck
off all that modesty permitted in the smoking compartment, and
climb up and finish his undressing after she was tucked in.</p>

<p>The wartime world, accustomed now to every fantasy of travel,
saw and was uninterested in the spectacle of the stately Judge
Timberlane, in undershirt, trousers, and glove-like Pullman
slippers, coming down the aisle carrying coat and shirt and shoes
and dangling tie, and climbing to the upper berth, the last public
view of him merely a pair of trousered legs waving high in air.</p>

<p>He was not a comic figure to himself, but even the dignity of
the reserved unhappiness that had come over him as he had watched
her all evening was denied him as he wriggled out of his trousers,
into his pajamas, sitting on half the constricted space of the
berth, while crowded over on her side under the blanket, her face
in the shadow of her pillow, she bleakly observed him. Her right
fingers lay touching her cheek; her bare arm was misted with the
sleeve of her thin nightgown. She would have been an invitation to
passion but that there was neither desire in her look nor any fun
of intimacy, but only wariness and a doubt that hinted of fear.</p>

<p>He remembered their honeymoon night, remembered the rowdy
adventure of her popping across the aisle and into his berth.</p>

<p>As he crawled under the covers beside her, and hesitatingly,
just to say good night, slipped his arm about her scarce-covered
shoulders, she flinched away from him. She moved over the inch or
two that was her only room for escape. He drew his arm back,
muttered "G' night" as indifferently as he could, and pretended to
sleep.</p>

<p>Astounding and sudden, he found that there were tears in his
eyes, and that he was mourning, "She is drifting away from me. I
can't hold her. She and Bradd were loyal to me, but there will be
another Bradd, a less scrupulous one, and I cannot hold her. She is
drifting away."</p>

<p>The last stage of their journey was on the "Borup," the familiar
old club car from St. Paul and Minneapolis to Grand Republic and
Duluth. Cass had known it since college days, and for twenty years
had known Mac, the old attendant. On it, very welcome, were Diantha
Marl and Eve Champeris, brittle and lively and superior in black
suits and small pert hats, and Cass was proud of them, citizenesses
of no mean city, proofs of home. But Jinny scarcely saw them. There
was nothing of her there except her slight body.</p>

<p>But she was still distantly civil as they arrived in Grand
Republic toward six, in a dusk that even the friendly sight of the
tall Pv elevators could not make anything but cold and dark.</p>

<h2>Chapter 45</h2>

<p>For Cass and Jinny, when they came in from New York, Mrs. Higbee
had ready a supper of hometown superiority: heart-shaped waffles
with creamed chicken, potato pancakes, pudding with extra hard
sauce.</p>

<p>Jinny looked at it and sniffed, "Tearoom junk."</p>

<p>She had not even asked for Cleo, and it was Cleo whom the fond,
habitual husband expected to lure his wayward girl back to
contentment. All husbands have such baits, and they are childishly
hurt when they do not catch the silver fish of love. Mrs. Higbee
"just didn't know where that ole Cleo was at." The animal had taken
to wintertime excursions and absences that she never explained. But
after supper, while Jinny was looking in a bored way at the Evening
Frontier, Cass found the little cat in a corner of the garage, half
under an old rug, looking up at him questioningly.</p>

<p>"It's all right, Cleo. I'm sure it's going to be all right,"
Cass insisted.</p>

<p>When Cleo was dropped into her lap, Jinny smiled, and hailed
her, "Have you been good, kit? Have you studied your rodentology,
and stayed away from the Toms?"</p>

<p>As she said it, Cass realized that it did not mean a thing, and
that if she could thus talk to the cat whom she truly loved through
a shroud of brooding, then she was distracted indeed. When Cleo
leaped from her lap and came resentfully over to him, Jinny did not
even notice.</p>

<p>"Tired?" he groped.</p>

<p>"Yes, very."</p>

<p>"Like me to call up Rose or the Wolkes or Jay and Pasadena or
somebody?"</p>

<p>"Not tonight."</p>

<p>"Uh&mdash;Jinny. I've had a&mdash;I think we might drive out and
see if Emily's grave is&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Please! Don't talk about that, ever. I'll go by myself some
time. I don't want to make a parade of it."</p>

<p>"I didn't&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sorry I'm so cranky. I feel all in." Her smile was a wince of
pain. "I think I'll go up and get undressed and crawl into bed and
read. You can kiss me good night now."</p>

<p>Their kiss was the touch of dry leaves drifting together, and
she did not look back as she went out to the hallway.</p>

<p>&mdash;She does miss Bradd. It's an awfully good thing I had the
sense to get her away from him when I did. Now we can start all
over again.</p>

<p>He settled to his accumulated mail, which stirred his usual
query whether Democracy could endure the inventions of the
typewriter and of advertising. He looked through the unsolicited
magazines, the brochure from the Wargate Corporation announcing
that right after the war they would be making everything out of
plastics&mdash;airplanes, egg-beaters, book-bindings, communion
cups, the bulletins from the numberless associations for organizing
virtue ("please send check or money-order immediately") and all the
other mimeographed letters with typed-in addresses which,
intimately addressing him as "Mr. J. Cass" or as "Mr. C. T. Judge,"
announced that they had heard of him as a Leading Citizen, so would
he kindly remit.</p>

<p>Lost amid these reminders of an enormous and clashing world
which had no interest in the tragi-comedy of married love, Cass
looked at his watch and was startled that an hour had sneaked by
since Jinny had gone upstairs. He would peep into her room, softly,
not to awaken her.</p>

<p>He tiptoed up and to her door. When he eased it open, she was
sitting on her bed, crosslegged, adorable in pajamas, her hair
reckless. She was so young, so feminine. She tilted her face with a
smile, but the smile suddenly closed, as though it were someone
else whom she had been expecting.</p>

<p>He stood just inside the door. She said gently, "My dear, it's
no go. I love Bradd&mdash;I love him! I thought I could run away
from him, but I'm going back to him, in New York."</p>

<p>These words took just over nine seconds to say, and they
devastated his life and hers completely.</p>

<p>Before he answered he draped a silk comforter about her, so that
she was in a little Asian tent. He sat on her pink-lined window
seat. The whole room seemed so female and incomprehensible to him.
He could no more fight it than he could fight the scent of
flowers.</p>

<p>"Going back to him immediately," she said.</p>

<p>"No. You're not. I'm going to hold you." But he was listening to
himself critically. "I'm going to fight for you. You're everything
that's good."</p>

<p>"Good?"</p>

<p>"Oh, you're not half as bad as you try to be."</p>

<p>"Don't be so smug!"</p>

<p>"I'm not. And I'm not angry, either. Not even at Bradd. He makes
me sick, more than angry. But I won't yield. For your sake, too.
You're sick; you can't stand this insanity just now. It will kill
you."</p>

<p>"It's the only thing that will <i>save</i> me. If I can't be
with him, I will die. I suppose it does look crazy&mdash;kiting
right back there, just after our return&mdash;but I'll be happy
then, and well."</p>

<p>"You'll never be happy with that fellow, not long. You think
you're a great adventuress, a great flaunter&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I do not!"</p>

<p>"But you're really a pathetic child. I can see you among those
big buildings, in the dark streets, trudging along, a little scared
figure, so little, with no one to depend on, once Bradd has let you
down."</p>

<p>"He'd never let me down."</p>

<p>"You know he will!"</p>

<p>"Well..."</p>

<p>"And you always forget you're ill."</p>

<p>"I never forget it. And I want to get well. That's why I must
have someone that I love near me."</p>

<p>After this implication, he could say nothing, and she raced on,
"It's all arranged. I've just this minute talked to Bradd on the
telephone. Oh, should I have done that, from your house? I'll pay
you for the call."</p>

<p>"Oh, God!"</p>

<p>She did not heed his cry. "I'm to stay with Avis, out in Darien,
and skip into the city once in a while and play around with
him&mdash;it will be enchanting. Avis knows all about diets, and
she'll watch mine, and I'll really look after my health, till you
divorce me."</p>

<p>"I'm not going to divorce you."</p>

<p>"I knew it! So old-fashioned! I thought you realized domestic
tyrants had gone out. Are you really going to try and handcuff me?
Well, let me tell you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stop it. I won't bind you, except to this extent: I insist on
your taking three months to think this over, and to find out what a
hard-hearted professional charmer Bradd is, before you file any
divorce suit. I'm afraid you'll have to do that back here in
Minnesota, unless you want to go to Reno. You won't be a resident
of Connecticut, and the only ground in New York State, even if you
established residence there, is adultery, and that's a cause which
I don't intend to afford you, no matter how obliging I would like
to be. If after this three months you still feel you must go ahead,
I shan't oppose it&mdash;I think. But&mdash;"</p>

<p>His law-office carefulness broke down. "My beloved, my dear
wife, I never thought I could say this, I thought I had too much
pride, I thought I despised acquiescent husbands too much, but I
would rather see you go off and be Bradd's mistress for a year and
then come back to me than see you divorced and lost to me. Life is
worthless without you."</p>

<p>"Life will be worth just as much to you as it was before you
ever saw me, and maybe more. I've been bad for you. And I'm sorry,
because I have great respect and fondness for you."</p>

<p>"'Respect and fondness'! God! What d'you think I am?"</p>

<p>"Now don't try to be the hairy-chested brute. It doesn't become
you. You <i>prefer</i> fondness and respect, and probably what you
stand for is much finer than any of the frivolous, dissipated
things that Bradd and I like."</p>

<p>"'Bradd and I'! Please keep that bastard's name out of
this."</p>

<p>"But can we?"</p>

<p>"No-o, but still&mdash;Look, Jinny. My life <i>wasn't</i> worth
much, before I saw you. Like most people, most of the time, I was
just getting along, satisfied if I wasn't sick or angry or too
tired or too lonely, plodding on toward a decent death, with no
idea at all what possibilities there were in the human mind
<i>and</i> body, and&mdash;Jinny! I've got to know. I keep skirting
around it but&mdash;Did you sleep with Bradd?"</p>

<p>Her embarrassment was less than his as she looked down at her
hands, slowly rubbed them, and answered "Yes." Then she raised her
head. "But never, honestly never, till just the other afternoon in
New York, when I went to his apartment. I thought it was just for a
drink, and to wait while he dressed for dinner and the show."</p>

<p>It was not at all with a dull ache that he heard the
catastrophe, but with a lively sickness and a runaway imagination.
He could see what to him was a horror and a blasphemy: Jinny shyly
undressing with her sacred body exposed to the gluttonous eyes and
cynical fumbling of that libertine, Jinny's breasts against the
cold heart of that thief and scoundrel, Jinny glancing up at him as
devotedly as she had at her husband.</p>

<p>His black shame for Jinny's nakedness, his black hatred of
Bradd, must have shown in his face. She was fluttering, "Now, I
guess you <i>will</i> divorce me!"</p>

<p>"I would not divorce you even if you became a public harlot.
Then least of all. You are my wife&mdash;not just a woman who
happens to be legally married to me. You can drive me away, but I
won't ever turn away, not ever."</p>

<p>A confused "Oh" from her, and a long, blinding silence out of
which he struggled:</p>

<p>"I hate your physical contact with another man, and I don't know
whether that's out of common jealousy or out of fastidiousness, and
I don't even care much&mdash;I hate it! Don't make any mistake
about that. But I suppose I could make myself forget it. I don't
know that your betrayal itself is any worse than the fact that it
happened with my oldest friend. And even that is no worse than the
discovery that you've lied to me."</p>

<p>"I never lied to you!"</p>

<p>"You certainly did, by implication&mdash;you and Bradd playing
out that farce of saying good-bye on the telephone, our last night
in New York...By the way, I suppose you and he had been together in
his apartment <i>that</i> afternoon, as well as the one
before?"</p>

<p>She did not answer.</p>

<p>&mdash;Jinny to wait for Mr. Bradd Criley's condescension in
Avis's select suburban residence! What a sordidness of respectable
adultery! Civilized divorce. Sophisticated modern sex relations.
Exquisite sluttishness. Fashionable bestiality. The intellectual
cocktail-hour diversion of smearing three lives with manure.</p>

<p>&mdash;Poor, bright, energetic, weak-minded Jinny, with no idea
what she'll be up against when she's not so young. I must take care
of her, even if I have to lock her in the attic.</p>

<p>Then he was urging, "Jinny! Let's be practical for a moment.
You're assuming that after you've stayed for a few months with that
delightful hag, Mrs. Elderman, and after I'm used to getting along
without you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I hope you will be."</p>

<p>"I hope I never shall! After death, you become used to getting
along without a lot of things, but that won't make it interesting.
I was saying: What makes you think Bradd will still want to marry
you? He's completely unscrupulous in protecting his freedom."</p>

<p>"You don't understand him. You can't. You're too old."</p>

<p>"Oh, come off it. I'm only two years older than he is."</p>

<p>"Not really. As I've told you before, you're fifteen years
older. He does things because they're fun."</p>

<p>"Sure. Great charmer!"</p>

<p>"Does charm seem to you such a bad quality for a girl to have in
a husband?"</p>

<p>&mdash;I'm not coming off so well in the argument. And this is a
life-death struggle to hold her, not just a squabble.</p>

<p>"Yes, I think it <i>is</i> bad, when it's deliberately turned on
and off, as it is with a blackguard like Criley."</p>

<p>"You mean 'heel,' don't you? You know, when you say he's a heel,
you're talking like a man, and it doesn't mean a thing to a woman,
unless she's half-man herself. Very few women care a hang about the
laws or the social rules. What they love in a man is the feeling
that he isn't merely <i>with</i> them, but that he <i>is</i> them,
and feels and thinks as they do before they've finished thinking
it. What people like you detest about the heels, the outlaws, is
that they don't give a hoot for the idiotic rules that you've set
up to protect your own awkwardness, which comes from your never
really being completely one with a woman, but always remaining a
little aside from her, noticing how good you are or how bad. And
expecting her to do what&mdash;Bradd just <i>laughs</i> when I'm
unpunctual, and maybe <i>you</i> can't trust what he says, but with
me he's <i>always</i> truthful!"</p>

<p>"Don't you suppose a lot of other women have defended Criley,
too?"</p>

<p>"Oh, don't call him 'Criley'. It sounds like childish
spite."</p>

<p>"Sorry. Can't thing of him any other way now. How many
women&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If Bradd has brought joy to a lot of bored women, is that
against him? Darling, let's not go on bickering. I <i>know</i>
Bradd! I didn't want to fall in love with him, and the last thing I
wanted to do was to hurt you. I really tried to run away from him.
I hope you won't remember me as a loose woman. I couldn't help it.
Bradd&mdash;he seems to understand everything that matters to a
woman. I do want to be quiet, but I'm afraid it will have to be
with <i>him</i>."</p>

<p>It sounded so flat and incontrovertible.</p>

<p>He broke off brusquely. "We could argue all night, but I guess
you'll need some sleep, if you're really taking another train
tomorrow. Good night."</p>

<p>He kissed her blankly and left her.</p>

<p>He sat in his room, rubbing his stocking feet, fertile in plan,
paralyzed in action. He went to bed and, certain that he could not
sleep, he slept. He awoke abruptly, longing for her and, without
meditation about it, padded into her room. It was dark. He wriggled
in beside her, tentatively slid his arm about her. She whispered,
"Oh, my dear, I do love you, too, in another way." She was crying,
and he let her cry on his shoulder.</p>

<p>A current of passion, which seemed to come from far outside
them, ran through them both, and her hand which had lain so laxly
on his shoulder tightened, and he turned toward her. He knew then
that, however demon-ridden she might be, there was something
eternal between them.</p>

<p>But when they awakened to early light, she sat up and said with
distaste, "You better skip back to your room and let me sleep. I
have a long journey ahead of me."</p>

<h2>Chapter 46</h2>

<p>"What we did last night&mdash;that <i>really</i> seems to me
immoral," she said at breakfast.</p>

<p>"Now look, Jin. Spare me the subtleties. I'm trying to say a
tender farewell to an erring daughter&mdash;and she <i>is</i>
erring beyond imagination&mdash;and that's all I can manage. This
whole business is plain imbecile."</p>

<p>"You've got to admit we've both been honest."</p>

<p>"When a mother loses her temper and beats her child and the
child yells, I suppose they're both <i>honest</i> enough!...Here. I
went over to Harley's, before you were up, and raised some cash.
Here's three hundred dollars."</p>

<p>"Thank you." Very non-committal.</p>

<p>"I'll send you a check at&mdash;Your address will be care of
Mrs. William Elderman, Darien? Of all the tragedies played to jazz,
that's the worst. Jinny! Won't you wait and think about it?"</p>

<p>"Please, Cass, oh, please! For Heaven's sake! Do we have to go
over everything again? I just want to get started."</p>

<p>She remained thus frozen until she had to turn over all her keys
to Mrs. Higbee, to whom she hesitated, "You might use the
vacuum-cleaner on the curtains in the living-room."</p>

<p>"Yes?" How Mrs. Higbee knew that Jinny was quitting, they did
not understand, but it was evident in her contempt.</p>

<p>"They're very pretty curtains, you know."</p>

<p>No answer.</p>

<p>"I picked them out."</p>

<p>No answer.</p>

<p>Cass was deciding that he would discharge Mrs. Higbee tomorrow,
then that he would never discharge her.</p>

<p>Jinny tried again. "And, uh, Mrs. Higbee?"</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"Remember to change the Judge's bathroom mat as often as it
needs it."</p>

<p>"I always have, Mrs. Timberlane. Is there anything else?"</p>

<p>"No-o, I don't think so."</p>

<p>Mrs. Higbee clumped out, her back an exclamation-point, and
Jinny peered, helpless and frightened, about the room that she had
made and that Cass and Cleo and she had come to love.</p>

<p>It was time to go. "I don't think I'll say good-bye to Mrs.
Higbee," trembled Jinny. "But to Cleo!"</p>

<p>The little cat had retreated far under the couch, and would not
come out to Jinny's pleading. "Kitty, I just want to stroke you
once more!" Jinny begged. "Please come out!"</p>

<p>Cass said evenly, "Sorry, Jin, but we'll have to hurry."</p>

<p>In the car, she sighed, "Nobody really cares one bit about me
here. All right. The hell with 'em!"</p>

<p>"One person loves you."</p>

<p>"I do love him, too."</p>

<p>On the station platform they kissed and said good-bye,
tightlipped. He recited, "I shall always be waiting for you."</p>

<p>"Don't wait."</p>

<p>"How can I help it? Good-bye, my Jinny."</p>

<p>Then, incredibly, she was in the train, gone from him, just two
years and two months, to the hour, after their marriage. He saw her
through a car window, so small, so helpless and defenseless,
looking around for her seat, and the train had snarled and
gone.</p>

<p>"Why did I let her go?" he marveled.</p>

<p>Then, first, he realized that he would have to explain her
absence to practically everybody in Radisson County. He heard the
whole male world of Grand Republic croaking, "Me, I'd of spanked
the little fool and locked her up."</p>

<p>It occurred to him as he stood on the platform, too confused to
get into his car, that he could refuse ever to give her a divorce,
that she had no grounds whatever.</p>

<p>&mdash;But I couldn't do anything of the sort, and I don't know
whether I'm a hero or a coward.</p>

<p>&mdash;I'll be alone tonight&mdash;tomorrow night&mdash;every
night now, no sight of her reading in her chair, no sound of her
voice, no good night to say to her&mdash;only loneliness and
silence to say good night to.<br>
<br></p>

<p><b>An Assemblage of Husbands and Wives</b>
</p>

<p><i>Helixes &amp; Silbersees</i>
</p>

<p>Dr. Sebastian Silbersee looked like a tall and wiry Scotch
soldier, and his wife Helma like a slender Jewess. Actually, he was
Jewish and she born an Austrian baroness of pure Gentile stock,
both of which facts she concealed, in Grand Republic, to be the
better identified with her husband.</p>

<p>Their closest acquaintances were Rice and Patty Helix, the
managers of the Masquers. The doctor believed that they were all
drawn together by his 'cello and Rice's ardent but stumble-footed
piano-playing, or by their common zeal in pinochle, but, without
the men's knowing it, the families stuck together because the two
wives were the little mothers of their husbands, and could keep
their learned boys happier when they played together.</p>

<p>The four had pick-up suppers, and afterward the doctor and Rice
went at their pinochle, feeling superior to the humble wives, who
washed the dishes and talked about preserves.</p>

<p>After World War I, the Baron Steinehre, born in a castle, had
been as poor and thin as a rabbit. He worked in a Vienna bank and
gave elegant little teas with the cakes limited to two per guest.
When his daughter Helma, in the clinic in which she was a volunteer
nurse, met the ardent but diffident young Dr. Silbersee, she
married him, chiefly because he was so gloomy about the future of
the Jews, and of Austria, and of aural surgery.</p>

<p>Leaning on her nervous strength, he was a great researcher;
without her, he was a cafe strategist. They fled from Vienna just
ahead of the Nazis, almost starved in London and in New York, and
then pushed out to the distant Grand Republic. The doctor gave up
notions of aural surgery, and was competent and fairly prosperous
as an eye, ear, nose, and throat factotum. If in Vienna he had
drunk in the reassurance of Helma as he had his coffee with whipped
cream, here on what he considered the frontier (even in the formal
gardens of the Webb Wargates, he went on expecting to see grizzly
bears), he was kept alive by her and his 'cello and the
Helixes.</p>

<p>Helma had to taste everything for him. She rather liked
ice-cream soda, comic strips, griddle cakes, baseball, oil-burners,
chummy medical salesmen, and the fact that everybody called him
either "Sebastian" or "Doc" the second time.</p>

<p>She molded his private life, but publicly, in his office, he was
still king, and there Helma revered him as much as the
student-baroness had done.</p>

<p>It was the opposite with the Helixes. Publicly, in "show
business," he was not very competent, but in private life he was a
bit too deft; he cheated at cards, he systematically failed to pay
his bills, and he drew and sold astrological charts.</p>

<p>This crookedness his wife accepted, and merely sought to
regulate. She tried to make him see that cheating and voodoo,
lovely though they are, and exciting, don't get you any farther on
the way to the heavenly reward of a white cottage with green blinds
in Wilmette, Illinois.</p>

<p>When they had met, she had been a run-of-the-mill
touring-company actress and he the stage-manager, playing small
roles and playing them drearily. She had married him because he was
the first man who had asked her; he had married her because she had
nice ankles and mended his socks, and because he owed her
twenty-seven dollars and a half which he could never repay
otherwise. It had been a tremendous success; they enjoyed both bed
and breakfast together, and the talk about everybody whom they
met.</p>

<p>He was not bad as a Little Theater director, because Patty told
him whom to cast and, at rehearsals, how to teach the local girls
not to walk across the stage as though they were going to the
corner-grocer for dried codfish. And she kept their income adequate
by doing all the housework, cooking the simpler vegetables so that
they seemed edible, and doing odd histrionic jobs on the radio.</p>

<p>With both the Silbersees and the Helixes, husband and wife
understood each other and, working hand in hand, they could defy
the world. They could exchange opinions about strangers, signals
that it was time to go home, or hints that here was a new patient,
a new theater contributor, with just a sliding glance of the eye.
At any party, Mrs. Silbersee accidentally let the heathen know what
a great physician her husband was, and Rice Helix indifferently
informed some merchant that if he could get Patty to broadcast on
his local program, everybody concerned would immediately make
inconceivable quantities of money.</p>

<p>After every party, walking home arm in arm, they would laugh
together, little delighted people walking home through the
twenty-below-zero Minnesota winter night.</p>

<p>No revolutionary cell, no laboratory team, was ever more secret
and loyal and quietly unscrupulous than the Silbersees together or
the Helixes together. Yet closer than either pair of lovers were
the minds of Helma and Patty when they recognized the golden
conspirator in each other, and saw that their two husbands could be
coaxed to be allies in the ceaseless warfare between the world and
couples who are so presumptuous as to want not wealth and publicity
but only love and serenity and a sandwich.</p>

<p>So every night when Rice was not directing a play, the four of
them met at the Silbersees' house or the Helixes'
two-rooms-over-a-store, and the men made a little music and played
a little pinochle, and the two wives gossiped in security.</p>

<p>It probably would not last. The Great World does not permit such
unquestioning love and ill-paid truancy.</p>

<h2>Chapter 47</h2>

<p>Cass Timberlane was pretending that he was a judge, sitting on
the bench in a murder case. What he was really doing was sitting on
the bench in a murder case.</p>

<p>The audible case was that of a construction-gang laborer who was
alleged to have killed his foreman with a pickaxe, after an
argument about Finland and Russia. Sweeney Fishberg, for the
defense, showed that there was a question which of the gang had
done it, and somehow suggested that it had been a good idea anyway.
He had smuggled into the case a confusing dispute as to which of
the suspects had worn a mustache at the time of the killing, and
for hours there had been the dreary and inexpert testimony of
barbers, neighbors, and people who happened to have taken snapshots
at that time&mdash;at about that time&mdash;somewhere near that
time&mdash;they thought.</p>

<p>Judge Timberlane was attentive enough, but his mind constantly
slid off to a second trial that was dearer to him and more
agonizing. In this inaudible and imaginary trial, he was the
defendant, charged with having killed Bradd Criley.</p>

<p>&mdash;Oh, quit your childish day-dreaming! You know that you're
too civilized, or too flabby, even to beat him up&mdash;as you once
boasted to Jinny that you could, you shanty chevalier!</p>

<p>&mdash;You don't particularly <i>want</i> to kill him.
"Vengeance is mine, saith the Lord: I will repay." But you haven't
even a good healthy desire for vengeance, the Lord's or anybody
else's. You don't see Bradd as an enemy, but as a worm, a crawler
into decent men's honest bread.</p>

<p>Suddenly the criminal in the imaginary trial was not himself but
Bradd, and he, as judge, was in a splendid, romantic position.
Awkward obstacles like codes and juries were cleared away. Bradd
trembled (though he had never yet seen Bradd tremble) before the
Judge, the very Judge whose lovely young wife he had stolen. He was
charged with rape, embezzlement, high treason. The Judge was
shining and mighty as an ancient Israelite law-giver upon his
throne, and righteousness glowed upon a face dark with honorable
wrath.</p>

<p>But his nobility triumphed, and he thundered, "Accused, while I
could send you to prison for all your shameful years, I hold the
law above my private wrong."</p>

<p>&mdash;Rats!</p>

<p>&mdash;Of course practically, the way I could get even with
Bradd would be to let the Wargates know what sort of a crook their
legal representative is. Pull him down, as for years I've helped to
raise him up.</p>

<p>&mdash;Yes? Now can you imagine what a decent fellow like Webb
would say if you came around tattling about one of his staff?</p>

<p>&mdash;Well, I didn't seriously mean I'd do it.</p>

<p>&mdash;You better <i>not</i> seriously-mean-it!</p>

<p>Cass would have said that he had small "imagination," but he did
have his projections of thought.</p>

<p>What would the ruthless and fickle Bradd do to his girl? Would
he live on with her, but so neglect and mock her that she would
escape into boozing or scarred cynicism? Would he kick her out, and
in that humiliation would she lose every pride and eagerness?</p>

<p>Cass did not at all think that her adultery was a prank to be
smiled over. He was raw with the affront. Yet he insisted that
there had never been in her any malice, any delight in hurting him.
She was fundamentally good, as the pleasant Bradd was fundamentally
evil.</p>

<p>Or so he meditated.<br>
<br></p>

<p>The minute Comedy of the Murderer's Mustache, on which hung the
life-imprisonment of a human being and the future of his family,
plodded on. Vincent Osprey, associated with Fishberg in the
defense, was making notes, then plucking at Fishberg's sleeve and
whispering into his irritated ear. The master of the court,
watching Osprey, reflected:</p>

<p>&mdash;I can tell he's been having a row with that grasping wife
of his again. He's so nervous and helpful.</p>

<p>Anyway, he would never write to her the long letter which he had
instantaneously planned while stooping to drink from the fountain
in the court-house corridor that morning: a nasty little piece of
literary goods about her new associates in the East being
libertines. As he listened to the pounding of the legal machinery,
his spite seemed as trivial as it would be useless. This tragedy of
his loss was as far beyond his control as this trial was beyond
control of the prisoner, and it had less sense and pattern.</p>

<p>Cass's defeat, he believed, came neither from the intentional
malice of men nor from the conscious irony of the gods. It merely
happened, like a storm, from causes that could be traced clearly
enough but still did not make sense. Human beings, who could crush
the atom and talk round the world, still could make no more
illuminating comment upon the collapse of solid-seeming love than
the ancient wailing, "Why&mdash;why&mdash;why?"<br>
<br></p>

<p>The session closed for the night. In his chambers, Cass wearily
took off his silk robe and handed it to George Hame.</p>

<p>"Sweeney doing a fine job," yawned George. "If he had a single
bit of evidence on his side, he'd get that Hunky off."</p>

<p>"Believe the fellow's guilty, George?"</p>

<p>"Guilty? Of course he is."</p>

<p>The Judge was thinking of his wife's lover. "What is guilt,
George?"</p>

<p>"You want a real definition, Judge&mdash;one to go in the
textbooks?"</p>

<p>"That would be valuable."</p>

<p>"Guilt is what makes you send for Sweeney Fishberg. Good
night"<br>
<br></p>

<p>Cass drove home by streets dreary with the packed and sooted
snow of late winter, to finish up the unhappiest labor he had ever
known: packing Jinny's clothes and trinkets to send them to her in
Connecticut.</p>

<p>It was like preparing a beloved body for burial.</p>

<p>Small white wool socks, "bobby socks" they were called, to be
worn with bare legs that were made-up to look tanned. He could see
her legs, the gloss of them speckled with tiny dots. He sighed and
packed the socks, patting them down in the top tray of her trunk,
wondering whether he would ever see them again.</p>

<p>Airy dresses, so flimsy and empty now, yet, as he fitted them on
hangers, recalling her swiftness and grace. Blouses and white silk
underclothes, which he found decorously folded in her bureau; a
boyish scarf, which she had loved for picnicking, and a sweater,
straight and prim, the curve of her breast gone from it; scuffed
tramping shoes, which recalled to him just when she had got this
scratch on one toe as they had bushwhacked through the woods by
Dead Squaw Lake, The nightgown which she had worn on her last night
at home. Round the shoulders were tiny wrinkles from her sleeping.
It seemed to him still warm from her body.</p>

<p>Her sketch-book, with gently spiteful drawings of Boone Havock's
bulkiness and Roy Drover's tough jaw...and Bradd Criley resting
easy and masterful on a golf stick, and Cass himself, put into the
costume of a cardinal.</p>

<p>The volume of Yeats that he had given to her and that she had
loved: the old edition, the blue cover with the falling leaves, the
cross, the mystic rose. He fumbled through it to a poem he had read
to her, sitting on windy Ojibway Hill:</p>

<blockquote>All the heavy days are over;<br>
Leave the body's colored pride<br>
Underneath the grass and clover,<br>
With the feet laid side by side.</blockquote>

<p>He saw Jinny lying stilled in the cumbersome earth. As he closed
the book, he noticed a corner of paper sticking from it, and pulled
out a note:</p>

<blockquote>How's for a swim this evening? You would comfort the
lonely heart of Bradd.</blockquote>

<p>Cass grimly replaced the note in the book, packed it, closed the
trunk.</p>

<p>But next morning, when the trunk was carried out by the
expressmen, it was as though her coffin were being borne out of the
house for the last time&mdash;the house that would not quicken
again to her voice and her light running; carried over the
threshold which she had always crossed so gallantly, unaided.<br>
<br></p>

<p><b>An Assemblage of Husbands and Wives</b>
</p>

<p><i>Vincent &amp; Cerise Osprey</i>
</p>

<p>Probably no duller nor more careful attorney had ever been
graduated from Oberlin College and the Yale Law School than Mr.
Vincent Osprey; probably no more devoted or less skillful husband
had ever existed; and certainly no more placidly selfish wife has
been recorded than Cerise, his consort.</p>

<p>She wanted fine clothes, furs, jewelry, automobiles, perfumes,
and English biscuits imported in tins; she wanted power,
admiration, and beauty; and neither Vincent's income nor Vincent's
influence was large enough to provide them.</p>

<p>Cerise never drank too much, and never fished for anything more
than fair words and a handshake from men. She did not expect them
to give her the treasures she longed for; she went beyond that, and
wanted them of her own right. But she was a collector of
celebrities. She simply had to have the great ones of the
town&mdash; the mayor, the judges, the millionaires such as the
Wargates, the Grannicks, and Berthold Eisenherz&mdash;at her table,
and she expected Vincent to persuade them to leave their nice warm
houses to go and eat petrified fowl at the residence of a minor
attorney.</p>

<p>Vince did once coax Webb and Louise Wargate to the house for
her, but he spent the evening in excitedly overselling Cerise's
talents to them, and they did not come again. She very properly
punished him, and for a month, whenever he tried to kiss her, his
lips reached nothing but her strong white teeth. She said, "Most
wives would just let you go on making a fool of yourself, but I
happen to be honest."</p>

<p>She went resolutely to his office and examined his books; she
knew exactly how much money he had; and yet she charged up bills
that he could not meet, and so endangered his small stock of credit
and his smaller stock of sanity. He was unavoidably in debt for his
insurance, his club memberships, and the installments on the
refrigerator, the car, the radio, and even the house, for naturally
he was one of those optimistic Americans who acquired these tribal
adornments on the installment-plan.</p>

<p>He tried to scold her about it, but she did not spit at him. She
had found a retort that was much more dramatic and
self-congratulatory: she over-apologized, and admired herself for
her humility in doing it. She was sorry; she had been blind,
thoughtless, bad; he must think she was a perfect fool; she was
sorry, <i>oh</i> she was so sorry!</p>

<p>As she said it, it was evident that she was thinking, "What a
miracle of modesty and good manners I am, to apologize to this
little squirt!"</p>

<p>When she had finished, she immediately hastened out to begin
running up a new bill or to insult the wife of his best client.</p>

<p>She did not treat only Vince to these improvisations on the
theme of humility. She also played her so-sorriness for the
neighbors from whom she had borrowed cocktail glasses,
table-cloths, and money, which she never returned till the owners
demanded them. She was a good actress. She could make her
repentances more infuriating than the original injuries.</p>

<p>They had one child, a small son, whom she taught to "forgive his
father for his meanness."</p>

<p>Vince was not so sub-human that he did not occasionally threaten
a rebellion. Once, when they were driving to Minneapolis and he
stopped at a village gasoline-station to fill the tank, she
wandered up Main Street and did not come back for half an hour. On
her return, he took a strong foreign-office attitude:</p>

<p>"Some day when you do that, I'm going to drive off and leave
you."</p>

<p>She looked at him a long time, then: "I hope to God you will.
Some of the hicks in this dump look like real men. Maybe I could
promote one of them into something better than a
title-searcher!"<br>
<br></p>

<p>When the war came, Vince was still of draft age, and he waited
to be called. Cerise immediately found an office job in the Wargate
plant; learned not only stenography but something about the
manufacture of wallboard, and became a real Career Woman, an office
politician and an intriguer against the women whose jobs she
wanted. Within a year she was receiving seventy-five dollars a
week.</p>

<p>Theoretically, she was paying a woman to care for her son, but
Vince paid the woman and Cerise blew in on dresses and bracelets
all of the seventy-five&mdash;and more. She said that they could
not afford a maid. She started with the noon shift, and before he
left for his office, he laid out breakfast for her. The complaints
about her extravagance which he dared not make to her face he
hinted about in notes which he left for her in the
refrigerator.</p>

<p>She told the women in the office about this cowardly and
exasperating trick.</p>

<p>The Wargate staff presently offered her a job in their new
Racine plant, at ninety a week, as personnel officer. She went home
to tell Vince. She would be going in a week.</p>

<p>"You can't leave me&mdash;and the boy!" he wailed.</p>

<p>"Well, I wouldn't mind taking the kid along, if I thought it was
good for him, but <i>you</i>, my dear Vinsolent, I hope I never
hear another of your dear old Yale songs again!"</p>

<p>During the week before she left him, Vince had to talk with
someone about the loss of his wife, or go mad, but as he had no
other intimates, the only person with whom he could talk was that
wife. She was not helpful. He begged her to tell him what to do,
and she suggested that he kill himself.</p>

<p>Presumably she did not mean it.</p>

<p>When she was gone, this correct young man, who for years had
trained himself to get eight hours' sleep, to do exercises before
the window for ten minutes every morning, to swim twice a week in
the Y.M.C.A. pool, never to use any word more foul than "Damn," and
nightly to kneel by his bed and say "Now I lay me down to sleep" as
he had done ever since he was three&mdash;this model young lawyer
within one week became a haggard hobo, unshaven, staggering,
publicly and noisily drunk, slobbering in saloons till he was
ordered out.</p>

<p>Judge Cass Timberlane, a man whom Vince revered, though the
Judge was only eight or nine years older than himself, came calling
on him, where he lay dirty in his dirty bed, and urged him to go
away, travel, forget. Vince sobbed that it was too late and he had
already "gone to the bad," but the Judge assured him that he, too,
had once fallen to pieces, even smaller and worse pieces than
Vince's.</p>

<p>He knew that the Judge's own wife was away from him, and gossips
were hinting that she had gone for good&mdash;and for bad. He cried
over the Judge's hand, and promised to be brave. He telegraphed to
the man with whom he had roomed in Oberlin, but whom he had not
seen for five years, to meet him in Chicago, and they would "have
reunion and high old time."</p>

<p>They met, took a room together at a hotel, and had a
distressingly dull do-you-remember dinner at the hotel cafe. After
the first spurt, they could think of nothing to say.</p>

<p>Vince excused himself. He was expecting a call from Racine, from
his dear wife, Cerise. He would be back in ten minutes. The friend
waited half an hour, and went up to their room. The window was
open, and twelve stories below, on the roof of an annex, a ragpile
of clothing, was Vincent Osprey.</p>

<p>Cerise came to Grand Republic for the funeral, and wept, but she
caught a train back to Racine that evening, leaving her son in the
care of her sister.</p>

<p>She told this sister that she was a modern woman, and just as
clear-minded as any man. And indeed the young man who met her at
the station in Racine was nothing like so clear-minded as Cerise,
who was paying his room-rent.</p>

<h2>Chapter 48</h2>

<p>For Cass, the worst, in the late Northern winter, when the
malicious cold and the ashen skies had gone on too long, when the
white world was speckled with dirt and the snow was spoiled for
skiing, was coming home from court to the dusky house that was
empty of her welcome. Her absence was not a negative thing, merely
a not-being-there; it was a positive and frightening presence,
which crept after him and made him turn quickly to see her
not-being-there.</p>

<p>He muttered "Jinny?" as he stood in the dark living-room, as
though she must hear him and come.</p>

<p>Cleo stoutly accompanied him through the house with her
inquiring "Mrawr?" and he talked to her more than to Mrs. Higbee.
Once, late at night, when he sat in the living-room alone with
Cleo, he heard her reasonlessly begin to purr, and watched her
watch an invisible presence in the room. Her eyes clearly followed
the unseen figure, to the piano, to the bookshelves, to Jinny's
chair, rested there, then, with slowly turning head, she followed
the apparition to the door and, half in terror, Cass thought that
in the doorway he could see an outline made of air.</p>

<p>&mdash;This is bad. Dangerous. I wonder if something could have
happened to her? I don't believe in this telepathy stuff, but I've
got to telephone to her.</p>

<p>&mdash;Don't be a fool!</p>

<p>He felt that he ought to rush out of the house, out of this
danger, go to a neighbor's, play bridge, anything. But he could not
endure having to explain Jinny's flight. For weeks after she had
gone, he was glad when he was invited to dinner, glad to know that
he still existed in somebody's affection, yet he always refused.
Except for public affairs, where he spoke more impersonally than
ever, he dined alone, silent, served by a silent Mrs. Higbee,
guarded by an attentive Cleo, whose eyes too often moved from him
to follow again the invisible being that slowly entered the room
and circled it and vanished.</p>

<p>It had taken him a fortnight to believe that Jinny actually had
left him, but as it became contemptuously clear, his state grew
worse. All evening, trying to escape into the security of Dickens
and Thackeray and Hardy, half-listening to the radio, he kept
himself from telephoning to Jinny in Darien.</p>

<p>At every moment through the evening, always calculating the
hour's difference in time between Grand Republic and Darien, he was
conscious of what she might now be doing. He saw her at bridge with
the Eldermans and a neighborhood widower&mdash;the widower was
imaginary, but Cass pictured him and his sticky little literary
goatee, and hated him. Then there were the evenings when the
Eldermans were out and Jinny was alone. She was listening to the
same network program as himself, and if he disliked it, he still
could not turn it off, because she might want to hear it.</p>

<p>He hoped that she was not lonely then, and he wanted to speak to
her, cheer her, reassure her. He thought of so many things about
which he really <i>must</i> telephone her&mdash;such as Cleo's
casually having kittens&mdash;but he dared not try, lest he reach
only Avis Elderman or her stupid husband or a Jinny patiently
answering his solicitude with "Lonely? Of course I'm not. In fact
we're having a wonderful party...<i>he</i> is here."</p>

<p>No, no! Surely she would not slap him thus.</p>

<p>But then&mdash;she might. He laid down for future generations
the discovery: "Love does queer things to people."</p>

<p>His mental dogging of her stopped sharply when his personal
Guardian Fiend buzzed in his ear, "And now, my boy, she is having a
little love-making with Bradd, your successor and a better man than
you."</p>

<p>He was presently able, in a slowly growing self-discipline, to
wipe out entirely that picture of them as lovers. He made an
injunction against thinking of it at all. He did not, however,
persuade himself that Jinny and Bradd were merely playing checkers,
or that some day she would raise that lovely face to him and say
with tender rebuke, "It was you only that I loved, all along, and
Bradd, whom you so unjustly suspected, is my long-lost
brother."</p>

<p>His hope was that Bradd was already cooling toward her, and that
was at once a vicarious humiliation and a preserving promise. After
all, Bradd had never seen in her any peculiar divinity, but only an
amusing freshness. Might he not tire of her soon?<br>
<br></p>

<p>He was happiest when the radio played such rustic memories as
"My Old Kentucky Home" and "Nelly Was a Lady." He could see himself
as a boy of eighteen with a Jinny aged sixteen, on a country
hayride in the dusk. They held hands and trusted each other, and
suddenly they were both of them eighty, on a country doorstep in
the sun, still holding hands, as true to each other as the coursing
rhythms of their blood.</p>

<p>He detested the bland, blond yapping of radio announcers, with
their new-world litany of cigarettes and liver pills and bean
soup&mdash; "yum, <i>good!</i>" He resented the fact that he was
coming to resemble the college students who cannot study without
the narcotic of unceasing radio sound.</p>

<p>But when he turned it off, the house was too solitary in the
Northern winter night, too quiet, and he sat listening for Jinny,
knowing that she would not come, yet forever listening for her
footstep, listening and afraid, not knowing of what he was afraid,
not daring to turn his head, afraid and rigid, while Cleo murmured
to the invisible passer-by, till he cried aloud and desperately
switched on the banal magnificence of a million-dollar band that
was right out of the jungle via Tin Pan Alley.</p>

<p>Yet when he remembered that Jinny and he had listened to the
radio with their arms about each other, relaxed and content with
love, then the strident gaiety was as intolerable as the menacing
silence.</p>

<p>He took to reading detective stories instead of the history
which, as the incorrigible Puritan, he felt he <i>ought</i> to
read. But that was not a soothing dissipation, for after them, in
bed, he heard from up in the attic, from down in the basement, from
all round the house, Limehouse cut-throats and international
agents, and rajahs looking for the idol's eye which he had stolen
in 1867. He really could hear them, too.<br>
<br></p>

<p>He thought of her loneliness, as well as his. He thought of all
the loneliness in the world:</p>

<p>Of widows who for a quarter-century had depended upon husbands
and noisy children, but were alone now in cottages where the clock
ticked too loudly. Of more prosperous widows surrounded by alien
chatter on the porches of gilt summer hotels. Of young men new to a
city, too poor for theaters, desperate in furnished rooms. Of other
young men, soldiers in strange camps. Of young women with a
richness of potential love but with no prettiness about them, alone
in the evening, waiting for a telephone call that would never come.
Of the lookout on a steamer long in the fog. Of traveling men
plodding in shaky cars from country store to store, over the
prairie that fled always back from them. Of Pullman porters late at
night, the passengers sleeping. Of rich old men, so rich that they
were afraid of all their bobbing relatives, invalid and waiting for
dawn. Of an old doctor, retired now, sitting in his worn chair,
knowing only too well what was wrong with him. Of kings and
watchmen and babies left alone to darkness.</p>

<p>If his travels into pity did not make him the less lonely, they
did turn his thoughts from himself, and he could endure it again to
look about the room that was too quick with suggestions of Jinny's
soft being: the lamp whose purchase had been such a triumph; the
chessmen that still bore the traces of her fingers. He could endure
it then, just endure it, as a patient endures the heart-jab that
did not quite kill him&mdash;this time&mdash;and he could even
endure the sound of a distant train whistle, loneliest and
loveliest of sounds.</p>

<p>But whenever the radio was not blatting, he was listening for
her, hearing her in a sound beyond sound, waiting for her,
listening for her, stooped and afraid, listening and afraid, like a
man in the condemned cell on the last, slow, irremediable
night.<br>
<br></p>

<p>To the public eye&mdash;and in Grand Republic that eye can be
quite public&mdash;he was doing what is known as "bearing up." In
court, he had never been so quick and sure; and he had never so
often taken briefs home for study. Perhaps, he thought grimly, her
absence is very good for my work.</p>

<p>But he knew that if to others his base seemed solid enough, he
was out of shape, a figure loose and without pattern.</p>

<p>He carried on an undeclared feud with Mrs. Higbee about eating.
He was in a mood to receive sympathy as the lean, suffering, and
vitaminless lover, but, with nothing more than a rebuking, "There's
some nice lamb chops tonight, Judge, and you didn't eat your lovely
chicken last night" as her sole maternal comment, he got no
satisfaction.</p>

<p>When she brought him an evening highball, Mrs. Higbee still used
the brass coasters upon which Jinny had insisted, to save the
mahogany, but when Cass went out to the kitchen, in a dull
kitchen-shuffle, to get himself a drink which he did not
particularly want, he no longer troubled to bring in a coaster with
it, and he rested the glass messily on a magazine, which would have
brought retribution from Jinny.</p>

<p>He lost, too, the habit of bringing home flowers, and sometimes,
dining alone, he disapprovingly noted his own table-manners, his
leaning despondently low over his soup-plate or sitting with his
elbows on the table and dipping his toast in the coffee or chasing
crumbs about the table.</p>

<p>As intently as a lonely woman fussing over pantry-shelves, he
grew absorbed in watching the whirling islands of bubbles on his
newly stirred cup of coffee: how handsome some of them were, with
one vast bubble-mountain in the center, how the lesser islands were
drawn across the current by the mass of the major island, and
mystically merged with it. There was the most cosmic of tragedies
when the great island crashed and dissolved against the high
porcelain bluffs.</p>

<p>"I think possibly you're giving too much attention to the
geography of bubbles," he noted.<br>
<br></p>

<p>To the world, he was as proper as ever, yet he saw himself
becoming a little queer. He was&mdash;for a while&mdash;slovenly
about "making this shirt do another day&mdash;just a little dirt on
the collar," and once this fanatical devotee to cleanliness did not
shave the duskiness of his jaw a second time before going out to a
public dinner, and once he forgot to brush his teeth before going
to bed.</p>

<p>His next degeneracy was a look into mystic asceticism. He cut
his cigarettes down to fifteen a day, and felt that God was
counting them and that, as a reward for this abstemiousness, He
would give back Jinny's love.</p>

<p>When the ice turned shoddy and went out of Dead Squaw Lake, Cass
found that he could be most satisfyingly alone in a canoe on those
chilly waters, and one twilight a man walking on the shore
incredulously heard the thin complaining of a flute out on the
lake, saw a canoe with a figure silhouetted on the leaden
ripples.</p>

<p>"That fellow must be a left-over Indian, or else he's crazy,"
thought the man.<br>
<br></p>

<p>When he was both idle and strained, as he often was now after
court hours, Cass was plagued by tunes that chased round and round
in his mind, or by "Far on the ringing plains of windy Troy"
repeating itself, without his volition. Worst mental parasite of
all, ceaselessly whirling like an electric fan at slow speed, was
"Silent upon a peak in Darien." That one he had started as a wry
pun, but before long it had become a recurrent horror, and it meant
for him only Jinny, in Darien, lying in the silence that was
death.</p>

<p>When he heard of Vincent Osprey's suicide, he felt that threat
menacing himself and, like everybody else now and then, Cass
wondered, "Am I losing my mind?" But, like everybody else, he did
not believe anything of the sort.</p>

<p>The suicide made him look at his brooding, his own indulgent
antics, and abruptly quit all that adult childishness. This
sensibleness had its own evils. No longer could the curiously
vicious forms of mental solitaire divert his mind from the loss of
Jinny. But he had had enough of the exhibitionism of the hair-shirt
of morbid love, and when he noticed that he was sloppily leaning
over his plate at his dinner, he sighed and straightened
himself.</p>

<p>He made himself put away the agonizing memorabilia of Jinny
still left in the living-room: the photographs of her, the silver
bowl for roses which she had especially loved, the painting of the
Sorshay River bluffs&mdash;not too good&mdash;which she had made on
an Indian Summer afternoon. He took to sitting in his tight little
paneled study, in which there was room only for himself and Cleo
and a portable radio&mdash;little room for memories.</p>

<p>But there he could not see her so clearly in his mind, and this
was tragic to him, and he wondered of what future it might be an
omen.<br>
<br></p>

<p>Though he was frozen with waiting for her, Cass was also busy
with war boards and Republican committees. Sometimes he estimated,
"I seem to have come out of my fever of wild-eyed love. But I'm not
too proud of that. I'd rather go really crazy than forget her and
become free&mdash;free for what?"</p>

<p>He was not altogether amused when he discovered that there were
times when it was pleasant to go to bed just when he wanted to, as
noisily as he wanted to or as quietly; to order only what <i>he</i>
liked to eat, and to wear the old brown hat.<br>
<br></p>

<p>Early May, this year, was not so much spring as a pallid and
invalid winter, and the shutting down of furnaces, the laying away
of overcoats, were more conspicuous than any riot of flowers.</p>

<p>Jinny had been gone from him for three months now.</p>

<p>They had written to each other mechanically, once a week. His
letters were the most fatiguing documents that he had ever
struggled over, and the most exact. He must be neither harsh nor
yet a beggar of love; he must leave her free&mdash;while trying to
trap her with anxious cunning. He wrote fully about Cleo, a little
about his court room and the Drovers.</p>

<p>Her small notes were equally competent&mdash;and false and lost
and pathetic.</p>

<p>She thought that she would establish residence in Vermont for
her divorce, but she did not feel well enough yet for that effort,
and Avis was insisting that she remain in Darien till she was quite
sure that she wanted to marry Bradd. ("<i>What?</i>" exulted Cass.)
She wrote "<i>Dear</i> Avis," and Cass could hear the fury in
it.</p>

<p>As an inveterate between-the-lines reader, he blissfully
concluded that she was seeing Bradd only under chaperonage, and he
hoped that she was having a dull time, but just when he was sure of
it, she wrote about a "gorgeous party that some people that live
near here pulled, they are great friends of Berg Nord as well as
Bradd: smart women and amusing men and lyric composers and
playwrites."</p>

<p>&mdash;Darling, you never could spell!</p>

<p>"They were just the kind of exciting people that I <i>told</i>
you we would meet in and around New York, if we were only
patient."</p>

<p>&mdash;The hell you did, my dear! You said you hated the
place.</p>

<p>"Bradd met all these people through Cousin Berg, whom I
introduced to him."</p>

<p>&mdash;That is the <i>worst</i> impertinence! It's <i>my</i>
Cousin Berg!</p>

<p>"He is getting to know them so well, they think he is just as
witty as they are, and we had a terrific time, charades and cooking
at an outdoor grill.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I did eat too many pastries and drink too much and
stay up late, and as a matter of fact, I'm writing this in bed,
where I'll have to stay for a day or two, not so well, but still it
was worth it."</p>

<p>He was worried to distraction. He wanted to telegraph to her, to
telephone, but what could he say? Nothing more than the advice by
which conscientious parents drive their infuriated children to
lives of vice: "Do take care of yourself." That he must not
say.</p>

<p>So he merely wrote to her&mdash;air mail: "I assume that after
your fine party but a little risky, you will, without being told,
see that you must take care of yourself."</p>

<p>Her next note frightened him even more. She wrote, in a script
that was not too steady:</p>

<blockquote>Cass dearest:<br>
<br>
Cant write much at this time, am still in bed tho getting much
better, <i>honestly</i>, don't worry my dear am <i>really</i> being
sensible this time. I have a good doctor here Dr. Liskett, he seems
to me much smarter than Roy. He has started me in on injections of
insulin which, you know, I never had before.<br>
<br>
I hate getting jabbed, like a poor trout with a hook but the Dr
says he is sure before long I can leave them off and don't you
worry, my dear.<br>
<br>
Your bad Jinny</blockquote>

<p>Then he did telephone to Darien.</p>

<p>He was told by a glacial butler that Mrs. Timberlane was now
able to leave her bed, that she was taking a short walk, should he
give her a message, and what was the nyme, please?</p>

<p>"No message," said Cass.</p>

<p>The word Insulin was a signal of disaster.</p>

<h2>Chapter 49</h2>

<p>From the heartiness with which it sought him out and welcomed
him back, once she had gone, he ruefully knew how much Jinny had
stood between him and his city. He was not at all certain that his
hope that she would yet really discover and love his Grand Republic
was not as great as his hope that she would again discover and love
himself.</p>

<p>His acquaintances did not say much about the highly publicized
secret of her absence. He would have liked it if they had said
more. They forgot her too easily. He wondered, but dared not ask,
whether even the intimates like Rose and Valerie, who had been so
easy with her and so chatty, had ever been really fond of her.</p>

<p>Had they considered her too demanding and critical, or had they
been afraid of some genuinely superior quality in her, or neither?
It seemed to him that it was one of the most marked conditions of
her youth that Jinny did not enough prize plain, human, neighborly
love and desire to be loved; it seemed to him one of the faults of
these same neighbors that they were not patient enough in waiting
till Jinny should acquire this humble affection along with her more
nimble virtues.</p>

<p>Slowly and shyly the neighbors let him know what they
thought.</p>

<p>Judge Blackstaff expressed everything he had to say with a clasp
of Cass's hand and a stately, antique, "You look well, son; I'm
glad of it"; and Madge Dedrick, Stella Avondene, the Marls and
Wargates took imaginary occasion to telephone, "Won't you drop in
for a drink this evening?"</p>

<p>They were so kind, he reflected; all his life he wanted to be
with them and ever nearer. This Grand Republic, neither too vast
nor too rustic, too formal nor too frontierlike, was home.</p>

<p>As was natural for a brooder over betrayed love, at first he
combined a resentment that nobody ever telephoned to him at all
with resentment when they did telephone, which was continually.
When he was invited to dinner, he said nervously, "No, no, I
can't&mdash; I'm tied up," and the moment he had finished
telephoning, he fretted, "Now why didn't I promise to go? I would
have enjoyed it."</p>

<p>It was chess which became his surest refuge. The pure
abstractness of the game was salvation from his thoughts as it once
had been from the worries of his job. But he had few people with
whom to play now. He was ashamed to turn again to Lucius Fliegend
or the Reverend Dr. Gadd, after neglecting them so long. Every
evening he worked out chess problems by himself.</p>

<p>Once, when Mrs. Higbee came in with firewood, he looked at her
with an idea.</p>

<p>"How would you like to learn to play chess, Mrs. Higbee?"</p>

<p>"No, <i>sir!</i> Too complicated for me."</p>

<p>She fled. For a while he looked speculatively at Cleo, but shook
his head.<br>
<br></p>

<p>Gradually he became easier, and in time he was seen about town
as much as that popular young semi-bachelor, Judge Timberlane, had
been before he met Jinny Marshland.</p>

<p>Boone and Queenie Havock, out of their fierce partisanship, were
the only ones of his hosts who said what they thought. They had him
in with Roy and Lillian Drover, and their attack was launched
immediately after dinner.</p>

<p>They sat in the magnificent and oppressive Havock library, with
its black-and-white marble floor, walls covered with dark-red satin
damask, books including the entire library of Sir Ashley
Ashelburton (except for such few books as Sir Ashley used to
<i>read</i>), and the elephantine automatic phonograph, on which a
Mozart concerto was faintly purring.</p>

<p>"Judgey," said Queenie, "why don't we get everything out from
under our belts? Personally, I think you're lucky. I don't know
whether your wife left you cold or you kicked her out&mdash;wait,
now!&mdash;and I don't care, but either way, she's no good. She's
pretty, if you like the skinny kind, and she's smart&mdash;though
not half as smart as Boone's new secretary, that I think he's
trying to make, the old false-alarm! But she never appreciated you
<i>or</i> us. The only kind of guy she ever liked was some
mattress-acrobat like Bradd or Jay, or some blues-singer like this
awful jerk Nimbus.</p>

<p>"Now you're beginning to get over your love-jag, maybe you can
see that Jinny is as stuck-up and bossy and tricky and grabbing as
a monkey. We only accepted her because she was your wife. She never
had the brains to appreciate your goodness, and she never had the
brains to see that a couple of two-fisted high-binders like Boone
and me are twice as interesting as some little New York
menu-expert. She thinks she knows all the answers because one time
she read a book. All right, buddy. Now shoot!"</p>

<p>They looked at him with such affection that he could only say,
"Queenie, I suppose you were always the meek little wife that never
raised your voice!"</p>

<p>"He's got something there," approved Boone.</p>

<p>Cass said slowly, "All of you have to love her if you love
me."</p>

<p>Lillian, the rarely-speaking, exclaimed, "You see, Roy, as I
told you, he doesn't just play at loving."</p>

<p>Roy snorted, "Okay, Cass. If she comes back, we'll admit we're
wrong. I've done harder things than that for you. I've sat and
listened to you trying to tell me that politicians ought to be a
bunch of faith-healers."</p>

<p>They all laughed, hastily, trying to sound comfortable.</p>

<p>"And, Cass, don't get us wrong," concluded Roy. "It ain't that
any of us think we're superior to the girl. We'll all admit that
she plays mighty fast ball, and that she knows a lot&mdash;for a
girl who doesn't know anything. Say, for God's sake, do we play
bridge or don't we play bridge, that's what I want to know, because
if things have got so now that when you go out for an evening to
play bridge, then you never get around to playing bridge, then I'm
going home and catch some sleep."</p>

<p>From that best of mothers-in-law, Mrs. Marshland, Cass received
only a letter: "We are hoping with you, dear son, that Jinny will
soon realize that candy does not make the best beefsteak."</p>

<p>One man Cass rather admired, for his imbecile courage.</p>

<p>John William Prutt, who had never yet informed a widow that he
was going to foreclose the mortgage without cordially shaking her
hand, spoke to Cass nervously:</p>

<p>"Judge, I trust you will forgive me if I am intrusive and
impertinent, but Mrs. Prutt and I have discussed it and we have
come to the conclusion that you ought to know that the better
element in the community are all in intense sympathy with you."</p>

<p>&mdash;I appreciate his good intentions, and Queenie's good
intentions, and Jinny's good intentions&mdash;I wish there weren't
so many good intentions around here. Thank God, Bradd at least has
no good intentions.</p>

<p>He was vaguely ashamed, these days, to find out how willingly
he, who had always praised Bradd, now listened to the familiar
gossip about him as a trifler and a master of pleasing but shifty
legal tactics. When Judge Flaaten observed, "I prefer an honest
crook like Fishberg to a crooked man of virtue like your friend
Criley," Cass said only an impassive "Well&mdash;"<br>
<br></p>

<p>He had thought of his niece Valerie as a little girl. He was
astonished when the child came calling in the uniform of the
Women's Army Corps, a soldier and a woman. (Though she must have
lied about her age by a year or two, to get in.) She attacked
martially:</p>

<p>"Uncle Judge, I'm off to camp, and I felt I had to come and tell
you that you oughtn't to let Aunt Jinny come back here at all."</p>

<p>"M?"</p>

<p>"Now I'm in the Army, I got to thinking, and I thought: People
keep saying there's a new world coming, and women's position will
change entirely. Well, it's come, and it <i>has</i> changed! But
there's still ten million dolls like Aunt Jinny, that haven't got
guts enough to hold down a job or enough patience to study, and
they think that modernity for women is simply being free to skip
around with any men they like, and get all the jewelry and
embroidered linens.</p>

<p>"I was looking at some photographs of these French guerrilla
women. They're so self-reliant; they can sleep in caves and live on
beans. Then I got to thinking about Jinny, and honestly, she makes
me sick!"</p>

<p>"Private Pennloss! I admire your warrior women&mdash;though
there's nothing 'modern' about them; the ancient Teuton women were
like that, too. But your Aunt Jinny&mdash;Do you remember, few
years ago, people said our college students were effete&mdash;never
walk anywhere? Those same boys are now fighting in hell. And if
Jinny ever <i>had</i> to, she could put on breeches and swing a
rifle over her shoulder and march all night as well as any of 'em.
Better! She had the courage to know what she wanted to do, and to
do it, and to do it openly!"</p>

<p>"Why, Uncle Judge, you do love her, don't you! She's lucky, and
she's an idiot. She hasn't heard there's a war on&mdash;that for
women, there's always a war on."</p>

<p>"Private, I want to see you when you're fifty, and your children
are blaming your generation for the next war, as your generation
blames mine."</p>

<p>"Darling, you're not that old. You're not a generation, you're a
sweetie. Will you marry me if I come home a colonel?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not. You're too efficient."</p>

<p>"You wait and see now. These days, you never can tell."</p>

<p>But with all these accusers of Jinny, there was one accuser of
Cass&mdash;Christabel Grau.<br>
<br></p>

<p>She came to call on him at home, as informally as Valerie. At
thirty-five, Chris looked fresh and kind, bright of eye, tender of
mouth.</p>

<p>"Just came to see how you are," she said blankly.</p>

<p>"This is magnificent, Chris! I was thinking about you last
evening: what fun we used to have riding our bikes. You used to
take me seriously. You'd accept all the fake names I used to give
you for the wild flowers. Let's go up and sit in my study. This
living-room is too&mdash;it's too formal."</p>

<p>As they went up, he was thinking that he had been a fool not to
have married Chris, the essential woman, the loving and loyal wife.
Jinny and Blanche, who seemed as different as swallow and peacock,
were both demanding, both civilly dictatorial, while the rich
stream of Chris's generosity wanted only to nourish the land. Could
he ever escape his fatal pattern and be courageous enough, original
enough, to allow himself to be unharassed?</p>

<p>He sat her in a red-leather chair facing his own, he gave her a
cigarette and a drink, and prepared to be cozy. And then Chris
attacked like a cobra.</p>

<p>"There's something I have to get off my chest, Cass. I know a
lot of people are giving you a hand, sympathizing with you because
Jinny had the sense to up and leave you, but I want you to know
that I don't!"</p>

<p>"M?"</p>

<p>"When I first saw her, I was jealous. I used to be quite fond of
you&mdash;in fact, I think I might have fallen in love with you, if
you'd ever been able to make up your mind what you wanted."</p>

<p>"M?"</p>

<p>"But then I came to love Jinny. She's only a tiny bit younger
than I am."</p>

<p>&mdash;Eight years, and you know it!</p>

<p>"But I felt as though she were my baby sister. I was devoted to
<i>both</i> of you, and I did want you to make a go of this
marriage. But, Cass, you were so selfish and inflexible with
her."</p>

<p>"M?"</p>

<p>"The way you used to ride her because she was a few minutes
late, sometimes. And expecting her to be amused by old stuffs like
Roy! Simply intolerable!"</p>

<p>"Chris! I haven't defended myself much, but now I'm going to. I
have been selfish to other people&mdash;to Blanche, to
you&mdash;and when I think of how I've imposed on my brother judges
to get off on trips with Jinny, I shudder. But Jinny I've loved
completely. I've given her everything I had, and I don't see how I
could give her anything that I didn't have and couldn't get. And
she knew the kind of smug citizen that she was marrying, and she'd
met all his smug friends. Nobody fooled her.</p>

<p>"Since you blame me, let me suggest&mdash;this doesn't affect my
love for her, mind you&mdash;that <i>she</i> might also have tried
to make the marriage succeed. She might have worked a little on her
job as a wife. If she was bored by my friends, she might have
worked a little harder at finding new ones and bringing them here.
I'd 've welcomed them! I married an angel, and I miss her
grotesquely, but I did everything to hold her, short of clipping
her wings, and you can't do that to an angel!"</p>

<p>Chris had thrown her cigarette at the open fire and was sitting
on the arm of his chair, stroking his hair. "I do know how you miss
her, Cass. Maybe what I loved in her was <i>you!</i>"</p>

<p>He leaned his head against her side, and her stroking hand was
still. She would love him so generously, now, without
bars&mdash;</p>

<p>He stood up abruptly, breaking the petty enchantment, and said,
"Let's turn on the radio. Must be time for the Cleveland
Orchestra."</p>

<p>He knew what peace and certainty he was gambling away for the
fantasy he called love.</p>

<p>That night he thought of Chris too warmly, and he petitioned the
spirit of Jinny, "Hurry back to me. I don't want to turn to Chris,
but I could."</p>

<p>He remembered that Cleo had made extravagant, rather immodest
advances to Chris, though Cleo was no cat-by-night, depending on
charm. She was now twice a mother, progressing toward being a
grandmother. Her more regular husband was reputed to be the John
William Prutts' black and white Tom, a conservative cat if there
ever was one, and Cleo had shown a growing conservatism in herself
by having her two editions of kittens in the most traditional
manner&mdash;in a bureau drawer. If Chris had been a cat,
<i>she</i> would have had her kittens in a bureau drawer,
preferably cedar-lined.</p>

<p>Till now, Cleo had obviously preferred the bodiless apparitions
of Jinny to Chris or any other sensible visitor, but she was
wavering. She allowed Chris to stroke her.</p>

<p>Did cats forget people? fretted Cass.<br>
<br></p>

<p><b>An Assemblage of Husbands and Wives</b>
</p>

<p><i>Norton Trock</i>
</p>

<p>In so vast a city as Grand Republic, with so ancient a
history&mdash; going clearly back 20,000 years to the first known
traces of Indian occupation&mdash;there were too many varieties of
marriage even to index. Stuart Vogel, the county agricultural
agent, and his wife, a skillful high-school teacher, deserve a
whole treatise. They met at night, courteous and cheerful, to share
in cooking the dinner, in reading plays for the next Masquers
production.</p>

<p>They had one sort of "modern marriage," and Norton and Isabel
Trock another, also modern.</p>

<p>Before her death, ten years ago, the elder Mrs. Trock often said
to the other ladies in hotel lounges with tapestries that she had
proved it was all nonsense, this offensive contemporary notion that
it was bad for an only son to have a widow mother hovering over
him. Look at her boy Norton, that neat and handsome young banker.
He had been frail, as a boy, and had shown the sweetest
old-fashioned manners, like a little prince, and so neat about
hanging up his clothes, yet look at him now: he was a fine swimmer,
a splendid boxer, a correct duck-shot&mdash;and all the girls were
crazy about him.</p>

<p>Then she died.</p>

<p>After her death, it was obvious to her older friends that she
had been right. At forty-eight, Norton was president of the Blue Ox
National Bank, in which Mr. Boone Havock was chief stockholder. He
had two bonny children, and his wife, Isabel, though not too bright
and not especially pretty, had the same daintiness as Norton's
mother.</p>

<p>He had always, since the age of three, called his mother
"Sweetheart," so that it had become her pet name among the choice
little set of the more fastidious matrons of Grand Republic, who
embroidered altar cloths and explained that they were of pure
English descent.</p>

<p>Sweetheart's husband had not been popular with these ladies. He
called himself a wholesale chemist, but as a matter of fact he was
in the liquor business. He was a coarse, red, bristling man,
without taste in altar cloths. Fortunately he died when Norty, as
Sweetheart called him, was only five years old, and fortunately he
left them almost six thousand dollars a year.</p>

<p>Sweetheart thought of moving to New England or France or Fiesole
or the Monterey Peninsula, but she could not sell the house, like a
dark stone prison, which her husband had inconsiderately built, and
the "wholesale chemist business" needed her shrewd eye.</p>

<p>But Sweetheart and Norty did travel, always the two of them
together and always first class. They were not lonely, for they had
each other; they could sit talking, lightly laughing, about their
fellow-travelers, possibly malicious but always well-bred, from
after dinner till after midnight.</p>

<p>She sent Norty to school in Connecticut and to that small but
thoroughly sound and Christian college, Toplady. She always rented
a cottage for herself near the institution, and Norty lived with
her and was spared the coarser associations with the rough male
students. But she saw to it that he did not fail to become manly;
she had private teachers for him in boxing, riding, swimming,
tennis, and bridge; and though vulgar competitors hinted that he
won by nasty little tricks, she crowed that he did win. He was also
a pianist, and sang French lyrics over which his mother, a
broad-minded woman, looked shocked but giggled in an advanced
manner.</p>

<p>After his college, they had a leisurely two years abroad, during
which they rode on camels and looked up at but did not climb the
First Pyramid. For two months they stayed at the loveliest pension
in Florence, filled with the most cultured in American and English
womanhood. In Lausanne they met an earl. In Canterbury, England,
Sweetheart bought a pair of lilac-colored kid slippers, with his
help, as usual, and they had to laugh at the strange affection he
had for these slippers. "Do put them on, Sweetheart dearest," he
begged, almost every evening. He preferred them even to her gold
slippers.</p>

<p>He did have the best taste, pointed out Sweetheart.</p>

<p>For three months they had a flat on the Left Bank in Paris and
Norty had a friendship with several exiled American poets and
novelists that was surprisingly vivid, considering how shaggy their
necks were and how many naughty words they used in the books they
had published privately.</p>

<p>Sweetheart watched their capital deftly, and when it was
diminished to the danger point, Norty and she reluctantly returned
to Grand Republic, to the morose stone house, and he started as a
clerk in the Blue Ox Bank. He was good. He liked figures. They were
impersonal and dependable, they partook of the divine, and yet they
could be mastered as the crude, inappreciative people about him
could not be.</p>

<p>Naturally, his mother and he lived together, while he looked for
a wife, with the assistance of the love, the industry, and the
remarkable intuition of Sweetheart. Together they inspected every
available girl in Radisson County and in the better (yet not too
vulgarly rich) sections of St. Paul, Duluth, Winona, and
Minneapolis.</p>

<p>He would go earnestly calling on these buds, he would play the
piano and sing the French songs, and stay till ten, at which hour
his mother would telephone him, even if it was long-distance, to
remind him that he had had a headache that afternoon.</p>

<p>Sweetheart always had the girl candidates at the house, and was
kind to them, and asked tactful questions about their stand on
homemade puddings, Republicanism, and the reservation of the Host.
She had one special test for the chicks. She showed them the bowl
of shaving soap which she imported from St. James's Street, London,
for Norty, and if the girl laughed or looked puzzled, it was
evident that she was a crude provincial.</p>

<p>The young ladies always failed to snare Prince Charming. Without
his mother being so intrusive as to point it out, Norty saw for
himself that they could never be counted on to warm his pajamas or
scrape the mud off his shoes or go out in the kitchen and cook
guinea hen or listen to his reading aloud of Ronald Firbank, as
Sweetheart could.</p>

<p>Some dozens of girls proved unfit. Norty said, "Sweetheart, I
think this whole country has become coarsened and vulgarized.
Democracy is all right as an ideal, but why must all the young
ladies today be so ribald and impertinent? There aren't any more
girls like you, dearest."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid that's true, but let's not give up hope," said
Sweetheart.</p>

<p>"Oh, I just don't care one bit about <i>any</i> of them!" Norty
cried petulantly, and kissed her.</p>

<p>They remained together all evening, every evening. They were
invited to dinner together. Norty grew&mdash;not older; he could
never, in the lulling spell of Sweetheart's tenderness, grow older,
but he did grow less young. Sweetheart sometimes said (but
laughingly) that he seemed a little bald, and his waistcoat (not
his "vest") was more robin-like. He chuckled once, and said that he
was catching up to her in age. Some day he would be able to marry
her.</p>

<p>Sweetheart thought that was sweet of him, but she worried over
it for a couple of days, then hinted, Sorry, but wasn't that remark
possibly in bad taste?</p>

<p>He almost cried.</p>

<p>Each year he was neater. He trained Ed Oleson to cut his hair
more precisely; his trousers hung even better; there was less
danger of anyone finding a cigarette crumb on his sleeve; and to
take care of the long-vexing, often-discussed question of how to
keep shoelaces and black dress-ties really neat in his top highboy
drawer, Sweetheart and he spent two week-ends building an intricate
nest of tiny cardboard compartments, which she lined with gold
tea-chest paper, kissing each one as she finished it.</p>

<p>"Imagine finding any <i>young</i> woman who would give such
attention to my needs!" he shrieked.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't say that!" she said, with satisfaction.</p>

<p>She was tireless in trying to coax him out of his moods of
violent depression which seemed to increase every year.</p>

<p>She died quickly, of an embolism, in his arms.</p>

<p>It was thought by his friends&mdash;who happened, most of them,
to be women of his mother's age and understanding&mdash;that Norty
would go mad.</p>

<p>Dr. Roy Drover coarsely advised him to "marry the first cutie
that makes a grab at you when you tickle 'em." Norty was not
offended by Dr. Drover's masculine brutality, as you might have
expected. Indeed, he came into the doctor's office frequently, and
invited him to the house for a drink. The clumsy doctor was
embarrassed by these offers of friendship, and growled, "Say, I'm
not a nosy psychiatrist that wants to hang around his patients,"
and the justly offended Norty cut him off. No, sir, Drover might
beg all he wanted to, but he was finished with the dull oaf.</p>

<p>After some weeks Norty found an aide and companion: Larry Drome,
a large young man who had been a truck-driver, policeman, soldier,
sailor. He had once been imprisoned for burglary, but that had been
a mistaken-identity case, explained Larry.</p>

<p>He became Norty's chauffeur, valet, and companion at gin-rummy.
Together they took motor trips into the Arrowhead forest, and
shared a cottage. Someone said that he had seen them together in
Los Angeles, and that Norty was introducing his handsome friend as
"Major Drome," but that was probably a lie. You know how small-city
people talk.</p>

<p>But the talk spread, like honey on your wrist.</p>

<p>The directors of the Blue Ox National, particularly Mr. Havock,
thought well of Norton Trock as a banker. He was first
vice-president now, in charge of personnel and of loans. He picked
careful assistants, and he could refuse a loan, or call one, with
tact. They wanted to make him president, but they were perturbed by
rumors, probably spread by his rivals.</p>

<p>Mr. Havock had never heard of Krafft-Ebing or Stekel, but he had
run construction-camps filled with hoboes, ex-convicts, and mess
boys. While he had never been educated into the history of Greek
and Roman culture and morals, also he had never been educated out
of a knowledge of hobo culture and morals. He had Norty for dinner,
along with Isabel Avondene, cousin of Stella. He had noted that
Isabel looked rather like Sweetheart. After dinner, when the two
men were alone, with cigars and bootlegged white mule, which Boone
preferred to brandy, as being stronger, Boone spoke:</p>

<p>"Nort, we want you to be president of the Blue Ox. But we have
to have a man who is a church member and a family-man&mdash;you
know, beyond criticism. Why don't you marry Izzy Avondene?"</p>

<p>"I don't know that I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You heard me!"</p>

<p>Norty wanted to be a sound husband. He sent his chauffeur,
Larry&mdash; a rough fellow who might have offended his virginal
wife&mdash;off to live in a boarding-house. Isabel and he had
bedrooms at opposite ends of a rather long corridor, but he did go
in to see her, nervously but politely.</p>

<p>They acquired two children in four years, but after that Norty
never again entered her bedroom, and he found it was "just too
ghastly inconvenient for poor Larry to tramp through all that snow
before he drives me to the bank in the morning." He installed Larry
again in an attic room of his large house, and again went off
canoeing with him.</p>

<p>Isabel consulted Dr. Drover, who was cross.</p>

<p>"Doctor, I loathe talking about such intimate things, but I
think I'm going a little crazy. I have such improper thoughts and I
don't seem to be able to control them, and I've tried to talk with
our rector, but he isn't of much help. My husband
never&mdash;uh&mdash;he never comes near me any more&mdash;at
night, I mean. He's always so nice and pleasant and he seems quite
fond of me, and he's <i>so</i> good about playing with the children
and entertaining my relatives and so on, but&mdash;I do miss
something."</p>

<p>"Did you&mdash;uh&mdash;did you enjoy it when&mdash;when he used
to come to you?"</p>

<p>"I was beginning to, I'm afraid."</p>

<p>"I'm not a mental doc, Isabel. I much prefer what surgery I can
get. But I can tell you this: Don't worry. You women never
understand how hard we husbands work, and it's just that Nort gets
all tired out, slaving away in that big bank, and so he
hasn't&mdash;he hasn't much left for you. Uh. He'll be all right
again when the pressure lets up. Now skip along, and don't be so
impatient with the poor fellow."</p>

<p>When she had gone, Dr. Drover thought, "Poor fellow, rats! Poor
<i>girl!</i> Nothing I can do. Wonder if these Chicago sex-sharks
do really know anything? I must ask some time, when I'm at a
medical convention."</p>

<p>Unlike Bernice Claypool, Isabel Trock could not frisk with
Bradds and lusty farmhands. After all, she was an Avondene!
Whenever she was distressed by lewd thoughts, she prayed. It did
not seem to help. So, from having too little of natural human
sinfulness, she became as pale and bewildered and hermit-like as
the oracular doctor's wife, Lillian, from having too much.</p>

<p>But Norty was blithe and rosy.</p>

<h2>Chapter 50</h2>

<p>Cass was worried by the pointless possession of two houses. He
could not give up the new house&mdash;it was hers&mdash;but as
spring grudgingly came on and he took long walks, he was only too
much attracted by Bergheim. He liked to go into that shuttered
cavern and sit there, thinking about this whole madhouse of
love.</p>

<p>&mdash;We're so civilized now that we can kill our horrid
enemies&mdash; year-old children&mdash;two hundred miles away, but
nobody except a few rather loveless professors has even begun to
understand love. Compared with our schools and churches, which are
supposed to instruct our emotions, the shabbiest business, even
advertising whisky, has been magnificent in its competence and
integrity.</p>

<p>&mdash;In the future of married life, will men have to let their
wives have as many lovers as they want? The men will hate it. I
would hate it, bitterly. Yet all these ages women have hated their
men making love to the gigglers. They've had to endure it. Is it
our turn now? I don't like it. But what has that to do with it.</p>

<p>&mdash;Will the world ever be truly civilized? We always assume
so, but will it? Could any caveman be more blundering than this
Judge Timberlane, who loses his one love to a fancy-footing shyster
named Criley?</p>

<p>&mdash;If the world ever learns that it knows nothing yet about
what keeps men and women loving each other, then will it have a
chance for some brief happiness before the eternal frozen night
sets in?</p>

<p>&mdash;You cannot heal the problems of any one marriage until
you heal the problems of an entire civilization founded upon
suspicion and superstition; and you cannot heal the problems of a
civilization thus founded until it realizes its own barbarous
nature, and realizes that what it thought was brave was only cruel,
what it thought was holy was only meanness, and what it thought
Success was merely the paper helmet of a clown more nimble than his
fellows, scrambling for a peanut in the dust of an ignoble
circus.</p>

<p>Thus brooding, remembering Jinny in airy dressing-gown
scampering through the gloom of Bergheim, remembering such
magnificent trivialities as their supping in the kitchen on
scrambled eggs, sadly finding on the back of the coat-closet door
the gay angels that Jinny had drawn in gold and scarlet, he was
apprehensive under the black spell of the house.</p>

<p>Abruptly, late in May, he committed patricide and sold it.</p>

<p>He sold it to a Scandinavian Lutheran church organization for an
"old folks' home." He hoped that the old folks might be quiet there
and trustful, and outlive the belief that God was always a man in
the dreary black of a Scandinavian preacher.</p>

<p>He went for the last look at Bergheim. Admitting that he was
sentimental about it, he took Cleo along, for her final pilgrimage
to that Viking paradise of desperate mice. But Cleo did not like it
now. She kept close to Cass, upstairs and down and into the
basement, where the Judge, who was a householder as well as a poet,
wanted to see again one of the finest oil-furnaces his skilled eye
had ever caressed.</p>

<p>They came out on the porch. While he was locking the door, the
little cat frisked across the lawn.</p>

<p>Cass heard a barking, and swung round in agitation to see two
dogs and some boys chasing Cleo over the grass. Before he could
yell, the dogs had trapped Cleo between them. One of them seized
her, its long teeth crushing her fragile ribs. It tossed her into
the air, and then the other dog pounced.</p>

<p>Running frantically, almost choking the dog who held Cleo, Cass
tore the mangled body from him, and held it to his chest.</p>

<p>The little cat half turned her head as if to try to look up at
him; then blankness went over her small face, and she was dead. The
tall man, like a Sioux chief, plodded to his car holding tight the
bleeding body. He was deaf; he could not hear the small boys
wailing apologies. As he walked, he was crying.</p>

<p>He drove home&mdash;to what had become home now, garish and
unloved&mdash; with one hand on the wheel and the other holding the
light body of the cat, dripping blood on him. Expressionless, he
drove the car into the garage, took up a spade, hefted it, and
buried the body, so tiny and unrecognizable, under a rosebush. He
walked into the house and upstairs. He changed his clothes and
brought the stained suit down to Mrs. Higbee.</p>

<p>"Will you have this dry-cleaned, please? It's all over blood.
Some dogs killed Cleo. Cleo is dead. Some dogs killed her. I buried
her."</p>

<p>"Oh, Judge, it seems like God is taking everything away from
us!"</p>

<p>He did not listen. He was trapped in a thought that he knew to
be superstitious, but he could not help linking Jinny to the dead
Cleo. He could not resist. He tramped to the telephone and dictated
a wire for Jinny, in Darien:</p>

<blockquote>Dear Jin, letter from you overdue, am worried, wire if
you are all right, love.</blockquote>

<p>He did not expect an answer till the next day, but that evening
he dared not stir from the house, and at a little after ten he was
called by Western Union.</p>

<p>"This the Judge? Day-letter, signed Jinny, from Darien,
Connecticut. Shall I read it to you? All ready? It's fairly
long:</p>

<blockquote>"Goody this gives me chance annoy my nurse and Avis who
might stop me but out of house for dinner. Got sick of having nurse
nagging me take my insulin she worse than you ever were darling so
laid off injections three days and on bat of candy in New York what
a fool I was am back in bed doctor seems worried wish you were here
to tuck me in things like this did not happen when with you but
honestly would you think four cream puffs equal to one wagonload
arsenic love love."</blockquote>

<p>Cass did not smile. He thought for not more than a minute. He
called Judge Blackstaff:</p>

<p>"Steve, I'm truly sorry but I must leave for New York tonight,
by car. Life and death. Will you phone George Hame for me and take
over? Thanks."</p>

<p>He called Alex Snowflower, Sheriff of the county:</p>

<p>"Sheriff? Cass Timberlane. I've got to be in Chicago, to catch a
plane East, tomorrow morning. Can you do something illegal and get
one of your deputies or somebody with enough gas to get me
there?"</p>

<p>"You bet your life I will, Judge. I'll drive you myself. You'll
get there."</p>

<p>"Awfully grateful. We want to make sure we won't get stopped,
though. I've got to be there!"</p>

<p>"Well be there. I'd like to see any Wisconsin cop halt Judge
Timberlane and the high sheriff of Radisson County! Expect me at
eleven."</p>

<p>Cass telephoned to Chicago, to a judge of consequence, who
promised that by some means, preferably legal, he would have a seat
for him on the morning airplane to New York.</p>

<p>All this time, Cass had been thinking about telephoning to
Darien. He could hear himself, only too clearly, bullying the
unpleasant butler, then demanding of Avis how Jinny was; hear
himself saying with impressive briefness, "I'll be there tomorrow,
about noon"; hear Avis floundering, "I don't know that it would be
convenient to have you come just now."</p>

<p>No. What he was really afraid of was that Avis would say that
Jinny was dead. He did not telephone to Darien.</p>

<p>Mrs. Higbee was lurking in the kitchen. When he plunged in with
"I'd like three or four sandwiches in a box, and some very hot
coffee in the thermos," she worried, "You look awful fierce and
wild, Judge. You going to her?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>She said nothing more.</p>

<p>Sheriff Snowflower came blasting up to the house ten minutes
before his promised time. Cass went out to him quietly. They shook
hands, saying nothing, and the Sheriff started off through the
decorous city streets at fifty miles an hour, which he increased to
an unswerving seventy as soon as they had come to the end of
Chippewa Avenue&mdash;an empty gray shell by night. They crossed
the Big Eagle River, soared to the top of the bluffs, and headed
southeast, for St. Croix Falls, on the Old North Military Road.</p>

<p>Cass had the familiar illusion that the countryside, unreal with
night, was running past them, trees charging at them, a hamlet of
ten houses hastily erected while they were coming up and hurled at
them, road curves swinging round to avoid them, while they sat
secure in this small, dark control-room, motionless, the center of
the world.</p>

<p>The more rapidly they drove, the more bulkily quiet was the
Sheriff. They were formal with each other at first. Though they
were neighbors in the court house, they knew each other only on
county business. At the start, it was "I hear Mrs. Timberlane is
kind of ill, Judge; we'll get you to her, all right," and "Thank
you, Sheriff," but they were both good farmers at heart and good
Middlewesterners and first-name-users, and after a hundred and
fifty miles it was "I'll tell you, Cass; I know Jinny has got my
Mildred skun forty ways for looks and brains, but me, I like a
plain wife that's a bearcat on kids and dumplings," and "No, I'll
argue with you about that, Alex; you've also got to think of what a
wife wants for <i>herself</i>."</p>

<p>Twice they stopped, and Cass was astonished to see an all-night
lunch, materialized out of darkness and actually standing still,
not rushing past them, astonished to learn how stiff he was, as he
eased himself out of the car. Ten minutes later, the place was
gone, lost back in the country that had been annihilated behind
them, and he could not remember what he had eaten.</p>

<p>Always he strained his eyes ahead, imagining, even a hundred
miles from Chicago, that he saw the city's glow. Yet when rows of
green-roofed suburban bungalows began to flow past, then factories
and wooden tenements and street cars, he felt that he had been
lifted up and instantly put down here.</p>

<p>He caught his plane, he slept all the way to New York, his
taxicab hurried into the Grand Central Terminal, and just before
one o'clock he was ringing the bell at Avis Elderman's large yellow
house in Darien.</p>

<p>The butler, small but swelling with superciliousness, opened the
door and said "Yes?"</p>

<p>It occurred to Cass that the man did not recognize him, perhaps
did not know that he existed; that he looked dusty and disarrayed;
that no one in the house knew that he was coming. But it also
occurred to him that a few feet away was his Jinny.</p>

<p>He said impatiently, "I'm Mr. Timberlane."</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"Damn it, Judge Timberlane!"</p>

<p>Everyone on that floor must have heard. Avis popped into sight,
down the hall, and the expression on her face indicated only that
it was <i>very</i> inconvenient to have strangers coming in just
before lunchtime.</p>

<p>He did not so much push the butler aside as blow him away with
the explosiveness of his "Avis! Jinny?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, Cass. Well&mdash;no&mdash;she isn't very well."</p>

<p>"But what&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She is in a coma."</p>

<p>"Does that mean&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not always, our doctor says. Not with insulin. But it's
serious. He brought her out of one coma, but&mdash;well, she's more
in kind of a daze now than a real coma. She keeps coming to, and
complaining&mdash; oh, not exactly complaining, perhaps,
but&mdash;It's very hard on the household, I <i>must</i> say, after
all we've done!"</p>

<p>"I'm going up to her."</p>

<p>"I don't know that that would be&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You heard me! Where is she?"</p>

<h2>Chapter 51</h2>

<p>The upper hallway was heavy with oak and dark-brown velvet
window-curtains. It was as ostentatiously modest as a funeral
parlor.</p>

<p>When Cass opened her door, there loomed up, to bar him, Dr.
Liskett, a plump, disapproving man with eyeglasses, grunting, "What
is it?"</p>

<p>"I'm Jinny's husband."</p>

<p>"Whose husband? Look. If you'll just wait downstairs&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Get out of the way!" said Cass.</p>

<p>The doctor simply disintegrated, in the too-mahoganized room,
and Cass was facing the too-ponderous bed in which he incredulously
saw his Jinny, her face seeming as tiny as Cleo's, among the great
pillows. As he went nearer, she was slowly opening her eyes, and
she feebly held up her arms to him, with a weak but exultant, "Oh,
Cass, my darling!"</p>

<p>Her eyes filmed over again. Her arms, too thin and anemic,
dropped, and she seemed to have gone.</p>

<p>"Doctor!" Cass muttered.</p>

<p>The man was there, more attentive.</p>

<p>"She'll come out of it again. She's in kind of an intermittent
mild delirium, with moments of entire lucidity. Sometimes her mind
wanders&mdash;you know, wool-gathering&mdash;but sometimes she
knows me perfectly, and I'm sorry to say that then she isn't
entirely polite. You must excuse me for not welcoming you. I didn't
realize who you were, when you first&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Has she a chance?"</p>

<p>"I think so. I brought her out of coma with insulin, and I
believe I have the sugar controlled. She might live five months or
five years or fifty, depending entirely on how well she obeys my
injunctions."</p>

<p>"From now on, she's going to obey entirely!" Cass said
grimly.</p>

<p>"And depending on whether she really wants to live."</p>

<p>"I'll see that she wants to live, now."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll just leave you two together, and be back in a couple
of hours. Her nurse is downstairs having her lunch. She'll be right
back. She knows all about the insulin and everything&mdash;you can
trust her&mdash;in fact, she's my sister-in-law. I hope you'll be
satisfied. See you soon, see you soon!" The sunbeam into which the
suspicious physician had now turned withdrew its light from the
room.</p>

<p>When the nurse came in, Cass did not even see her. He was
sitting rigid, watching Jinny's restless drowsing. He was angrily
fretting, "If she only had a real doctor, like Roy. That
chintz-covered fellow here just got interested in me when he
realized I'll be paying his bill. For <i>Jinny</i> to have a
medical rabbit like that!"</p>

<p>The nurse looked once at Cass and sat down in appreciative
silence.</p>

<p>Jinny moved, then lifted again out of her muted delirium. She
smiled at him, and he sat awkwardly on the bed, pillowing her head
on the crook of his arm. She spoke clearly, at first:</p>

<p>"Dearest, take me out of here. I want to see our house. I want
to see Cleo and Isis. And Rose and Valerie and Roy. And Chris. I
don't like these people here. Not any of them. No. I kept wondering
when you would come and take me back home."</p>

<p>She slipped into a half-delirium. She thought that they were in
Pioneer Falls, on a picnic, and there was no color but rose, no
time save youth, in the misty fourth dimension in which she was
wandering.</p>

<p>"I love cocoanut layer cake; it is very superior, don't you
think? Do they have any in Paris?</p>

<p>"Maybe I can go there&mdash;to Paris&mdash;with Cass. He is very
bright. He knows everything and he isn't afraid of anything. We
would go there and sit at a cafe and talk all day, and if I were
scared of all those French people&mdash;Do the kittens and dogs in
Paris understand French?</p>

<p>"This path leads to a shady place under the birch trees, and I
sat there beside him on the moss, and there was a patch of clover
out in the bright sun, and we could see a meadow mouse, the tiniest
thing but so wise and spry, and I wouldn't like to die, I can't die
and go off into darkness before I sit there with Cass again and
look at a field mouse, so small and wise&mdash;</p>

<p>"Bradd doesn't like sick people. Once I didn't either, they
bored me and they smelled funny, I just liked them lively and doing
things and that's how Bradd is, but Cass would keep the bats' wings
away, he's so serious with his damn books but he would protect me,
and how could I die now, when I'm just learning how to live?"</p>

<p>A mumbling, and then she was conscious, asking weakly, "Am I
talking nonsense? I sort of hear myself. Am I silly, and
disappointing you, after so long away? You know, it's hard to die
with much dignity."</p>

<p>"Don't!"</p>

<p>"No, I won't die. I think maybe I would have, if you hadn't
come. I <i>have</i> been a fool! I was young&mdash;but not that
young! I do know a little better now. Quicksilver people like Bradd
slide away from you so. Take me away from here, Cass, please
do!"</p>

<p>"I will!"</p>

<p>"As soon as you can. And then we'll be happy&mdash;pretty happy.
If you can just manage to hold onto me for one more year, only one
year, Cass, I'll learn. Hold me close. They come in here and stare
at me and wonder if I'm dead, or if they will have to go on having
me here. Hold me!"</p>

<p>Her head was pressed against his arm as she again vanished into
danger. She was so still that he thought that had been her last
beseeching cry.</p>

<p>The nurse came from nowhere, felt Jinny's pulse, nodded with
"She's all right, sir."</p>

<p>Then Bradd Criley was in the room.</p>

<p>He came in with the hasty air of having just arrived from the
city and, immediately afterward, the highly uncomfortable air of
not having been told that Cass was here.</p>

<p>Cass stood up. He passionately wanted to do three things: to be
an honorable judge, to have Jinny love him, and to kill Bradd
Criley. He rapidly compromised. He decided merely to hit him. He
could feel himself slapping Bradd, like a righteous schoolmaster;
he could feel his fingers smack against that suave and treacherous
cheek. His arm flew up, but he heard the voice of his law-school
dean: "The essence of the law is that the sweets of private
vengeance shall be denied."</p>

<p>He said to Bradd, "Oh, get out."</p>

<p>Bradd got.</p>

<p>Cass's fury was ruined then by a cheerful thought, the first one
he had had in many days: the thought of how impertinent he had been
in kicking Bradd out of this room in his sister's house. He turned
to the bed, hoping for appreciation of the ribaldry of the
thing&mdash;and he got it!</p>

<p>Jinny was smiling, trying to speak. Bending over, he heard her
whisper, "I'm sorry you didn't sock him! That's the only thing I
dislike about you: you're so blasted patient. He needs hitting, he
does. Why, Cass, he's a heel!" She had a pale, self-congratulatory
smirk at this huge discovery, but it softened to tenderness. "So
irritatingly noble. But, darling, I would have died, if you hadn't
come. I really am yours now, Cass."</p>

<p>Then, after minutes of drowsy rest, "Do you think less of me
because Bradd has turned me down&mdash;him <i>and</i> his sweet
sister? He's been trying to sneak out of love gracefully, and
that's so hard to do. Can you still like me, now that you know I'm
just a poor thing, that couldn't hold even a Bradd? I do love you
now. Am I too late? I have learned&mdash;but why did I have to pick
such an expensive teacher&mdash;and take all the extras? Dear
single-minded Cass!"</p>

<p>It had taken her two dragging minutes to get through this
voluminous speech, while Cass stroked her hand and sometimes
hesitatingly kissed it, and the nurse knitted in a corner and
clucked with approval.</p>

<p>Jinny relaxed then in her first natural sleep.<br>
<br></p>

<p>Yes, said Dr. Liskett, what his patient most needed was rest and
quiet, and he seemed to feel some strain here in this house. (The
doctor got around a lot, and saw things.) Yes, it might be better
for Mrs. Timberlane to be transferred, by ambulance and only seven
miles away, to that charming Pleasant Air Inn on the Sound, so
comfortable and the prices so reasonable. She need not be dressed,
and the nurse and doctor would go right with her. Oh, gladly.</p>

<p>Unscrupulously, Cass wrapped her in the indignant Elderman
blankets and quilt. But he did not, as he wanted to, leave for Avis
a note: "Kindly send bill for wife's board &amp; room to C.
Timberlane."</p>

<p>Neither he nor Jinny saw any kind of Elderman or Criley as they
left.<br>
<br></p>

<p>In the month during which they stayed at the Inn and Jinny
became well enough to walk for ten minutes at a time, Cass
telephoned long-distance to Judge Blackstaff, offering to resign
his deserted post, and was answered, "Don't be silly, son. Come
back to us, come back home, when you can. We miss you
and&mdash;uh&mdash;we miss your wife. Good luck!"</p>

<p>His chessmen had been sent on from Grand Republic, along with
his clothes, and for chess partners he found a clergyman, a Polish
shoemaker, a schoolboy&mdash;and Jinny.<br>
<br></p>

<p>"You know," said Jinny, half-puzzled, half-merry, "I think Avis
was even more bothered by having to fuss over a diabetic diet for
me, and maybe the cook would quit, than over my relationship to
Bradd. But I'm sure she kept worrying, 'Why does my brother want to
marry a semi-invalid&mdash;a diabetic?'"</p>

<p>It was revealed to Cass, shockingly, that Bradd had never wanted
to marry her; that he had been as resentful as his sister at being
trapped into anything so permanent; and that, just now, he was
probably relieved at being rid of her.<br>
<br></p>

<p>In a fortnight, Jinny was strong enough for the inevitable peace
treaty.</p>

<p>She worried, "You honestly do love me, after Bradd?"</p>

<p>"What has that to do with my loving you? I hated it, I loathed
it, but that didn't change the shape of my nose or my heart."</p>

<p>"I'm not really the little thrush you thought I was. I'm a good
deal of a vixen, don't you think?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Oh!...Oh, do you?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"But then&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I told you: what has that to do with my loving you?"</p>

<p>"Oh."</p>

<p>"What we have to discuss is: Naturally, I want you to come home
to Grand Republic with me."</p>

<p>"And I want to."</p>

<p>"But you'll have to reconcile people; not just Roy and Boone,
but even Rose and Valerie. And Mrs. Higbee. Don't be
superior&mdash;like Bradd. She gave you as much of her life as you
would take, and you took quite a bit. Do you think you can stand
working at winning back these people, of whom you didn't think too
highly in the first place?"</p>

<p>"I guess that after being lost in these Eastern crowds, so
indifferent, I want to go some place where they love you enough to
hate you if you don't love <i>them</i>. I'll try. I will. Oh, Cass,
I can't say I'm sorry for everything I did. I couldn't help it. But
it <i>is</i> all over now. Can you stand it even if I can't make
myself all dramatic and repentant?"</p>

<p>"I can."<br>
<br></p>

<p>Jinny had no chance against the ancient wisdom of Mrs. Higbee.
When they arrived at the house, that clairvoyant was as cheerful
and casual as if they had merely gone to Pioneer Falls for the day.
Rose Pennloss and Frank Brightwing and Judge Flaaten met them at
the train, and in the house were flowers from the Havocks, the
Drovers, the Blackstaffs, and Sheriff Alex Snowflower.</p>

<p>To its fugitive children, Grand Republic will forgive almost
anything if they will but come back home.</p>

<p>When she had suddenly kissed Mrs. Higbee, when she had exclaimed
over the flowers, Jinny said gleefully, "Now Cleo. Where is that
darn animal, bless her?"</p>

<p>Cass went cold. At the Pleasant Air Inn, he had lied about Cleo,
but he reluctantly told her now.</p>

<p>Jinny broke, "It was me that killed her, by deserting her." He
sent her off to bed with what empty comforts there are for
grief.</p>

<p>Next morning, there were eleven invitations for Judge and Mrs.
Timberlane&mdash;to come to dinner, cocktails, trout-fishing,
sailing on Dead Squaw Lake. To his tactful telephonic refusals,
eleven hosts or hostesses answered, "Still sick? Oh, the poor girl!
Give her my love, Cass."</p>

<h2>Chapter 52</h2>

<p>That was a particularly hot summer in the Sorshay Valley, and
Cass and Jinny, keeping close, built up such a community of
unimportant interests that he sometimes forgot that she had been
away. And, save that she had the annoyance of diet and insulin
injections, and had to be in bed by ten, they often forgot that she
was ill. They were bound together by the discussion of Mayor
Stopple's political ideals, of why the chickens from the Superba
market were so tough, and all the other epic insignificances of a
pleasant life.</p>

<p>The long, serene Indian Summer was carnival. The hills were
extravagant as with Chippewa head-dresses and the far smoke from
Chippewa fires. The sky had the curious and innocent blue of the
North Middlewest, and the air such cheerfulness that Jinny was
filled with renewed joy and submitted to Cass an idea about
one&mdash; just <i>one</i>&mdash;party with dancing till
midnight.</p>

<p>"No cocktails, no midnight sun," he said, "and don't coax.
You're to be in bed by ten even if I have to carry you."</p>

<p>She was only mildly sad about it, just enough to assert her
non-existent independence, and he discovered that he had made a
psychological advance. He did not worry about that sadness. Once,
when she had complained that she "didn't have much fun," he had
felt guilty, but now he reassured himself that most sick girls and
most judges over forty do get along without much riotous fun.</p>

<p>Possibly both of them would yet grow up.<br>
<br></p>

<p>They walked beside the lake, with an autumnal sunset like a
burning forest over the crinkled and lapping water, on which the
rowboats stirred and whispered.</p>

<p>When they came home, Jinny was summoned to the telephone, and
she returned from the call half-exasperated and half-amused, to
hurl at Cass, "The persistence of the amorous male!"</p>

<p>"M?"</p>

<p>"That was Fred Nimbus, our radio friend. Jolly old Fred! Hears
I'm much better&mdash;ready to be put into circulation, and would I
like to have him call around some afternoon?"</p>

<p>They were side by side on the glazed chintz of the glider, on
the screened porch. She reached for his hand, and she sounded
frightened:</p>

<p>"When I think what his call probably means, I'm scared. Have I a
reputation here for being a fast woman, merely because
I&mdash;Well, I can see how I might. Have I?"</p>

<p>He lied as well as he could.</p>

<p>She had always been reticent about her feelings, but now she
brought them out anxiously:</p>

<p>"I do want to try and tell you how&mdash;You've been waiting to
have me say that I'm sorry for going off with Bradd. Haven't
you?"</p>

<p>"Well, if you want to."</p>

<p>"And I am sorry, terribly sorry, for having hurt you. But I
can't honestly say I'm sorry I knew Bradd. He gave me the
education&mdash; such a bitter education it was, but so
thorough&mdash;that you'd had before I ever saw you."</p>

<p>"I don't understand."</p>

<p>"I told you once long ago&mdash;but you didn't listen&mdash;that
I've always been jealous of your experiences with Blanche and
Chris."</p>

<p>"Oh, not Chris!"</p>

<p>"Sure. She's a woman of character. She may get you yet, and
maybe that would be a very good thing for you. <i>Just let her try
it</i>!...But it was your life with Blanche that maddened me. She
shared your first love, your first wandering, your first house. You
gave her your first eagerness. Even if you did come to hate her,
you learned what it was all about with <i>her</i>. But I'd never
had anybody but you. How could I size up life, size up even you? I
thought maybe with Bradd, it would be a new world. Well, it was. A
horrible one, but thrilling. And then being with Bradd made me
appreciate <i>you</i>.</p>

<p>"He's so grasping&mdash;in his lively way. He takes so much that
finally I saw that I'd always been taking from <i>you</i>, and not
trying to give much. I will now. I will try. I'm poor in spirit
now, but I will give what I have. But if I've learned that, how can
I be sorry for anything that happened?"</p>

<p>"You're not poor in spirit. You're so rich&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And that's the other thing&mdash;your worst fault. You praise
me too much. You inform the world <i>and</i> me that I'm the
greatest beauty, the smartest draftsman, the slickest tennis-player
since Leonardo da Vinci, and will I please show my paces. I can't
live up to it. When you advertise me so much, it makes me perverse;
it makes me want to be vicious.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;All these words! I have no skill in them. I just
wanted to say that I did have to learn about myself, and I know it
almost killed me, as it hurt you, but you brought me back to life,
you keep me living, you <i>are</i> my life."</p>

<p>She cried a little, and in their kiss her love seemed to be
utterly restored.</p>

<p>They had been living like brother and sister. He had not even
hinted of love-making. He did not know whether he was fatuous or
noble in not demanding his "rights." With Jinny, he felt as much as
ever that he had no rights, only privileges.</p>

<p>That night, with his breath in a harsh rhythm not so unlike
sobbing, he went into her room, and in the bedside light she
stretched out her arms with a passionate "Dear, dear love!"</p>

<p>He still did not quite believe it, but when he lay beside her,
she murmured, "We've found each other again, sweet! I don't know
how I ever strayed. How could I? Now, I <i>am</i> sorry, I am
repentant, I do love you!"</p>

<p>Every bond of caution was broken. It was very sweet.</p>

<p>It was sweet until he realized that she had been cheating for
generosity's sake, that she could not really respond to him. She
was trying to and failing, he was humiliated a moment. Then he was
grateful. He said tenderly, "You've been brave and wonderfully
kind. But you're still shut off from me, aren't you? You still
haven't got Bradd quite out of your system. Don't be afraid to tell
me. He still holds you?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid so. Though I detest him. He's so ruthless. But maybe
that made him a good teacher. Wouldn't it be strange if he taught
me to give, by his never giving anything! Then this miserable
business&mdash;I know it was that now&mdash;it won't all have been
a waste. Can that be?"</p>

<p>"I think so. Jinny! If you're ever moved by your own self, by
your own desire, to come to me, I'll be waiting. Will you, when you
feel like it? Will you remember?"</p>

<p>"I shall remember."</p>

<p>"And I won't overpraise you any more."</p>

<p>"Now look! You needn't be a fanatic about it!"<br>
<br></p>

<p>They were cheerful at dinner, the next evening. Jinny
voluntarily announced that there were times when she did not mind
these messes of green vegetables.</p>

<p>"Not more than having your teeth pulled?"</p>

<p>"Not <i>much</i> more," she asserted.</p>

<p>After dessert&mdash;a bread-pudding in which Cass said there was
merit, and Jinny said Yes, but not much else&mdash;Mrs. Higbee
placed on the table a teapot-cover: no cups, just the pink quilted
tent. They gaped at her, and she stood expressionless. They looked
at the cover, and it was moving, by itself.</p>

<p>Jinny snatched it up, and beneath it was a little black kitten,
all black, midnight black, cocky and independent and purring and
kneading with its paws.</p>

<p>"It is&mdash;it <i>is</i> Cleo!" cried Jinny. She put out her
hand and the kitten rubbed against it, and glanced over at Cass for
applause, in Cleo's old familiar way.</p>

<p>Mrs. Higbee said indulgently, "It's Cleo's own granddaughter. I
got her off the Prutts' cook. Only, I feel like it's Cleo herself.
You can't kill people like her, not for keeps."</p>

<p>Jinny smoothed the kitten, while Cass wondered, "Is this an omen
that even our Emily may return and we'll have made the greatest
human journey&mdash;in a circle back to the innocence with which we
began?"</p>

<p>When Jinny set the kitten down, it stepped out gallantly across
the cloth.</p>

<p>"You get right off that table, Cleo!" said Mrs. Higbee.<br>
<br></p>

<p>On that January evening, Roy Drover telephoned:</p>

<p>"Bradd Criley is going to be in town tomorrow, just for the one
day, to see the Wargates. He'll have an hour free, and he's coming
to my place for cocktails. I want you and Jinny to show up. Now
don't be a mule. Let bygones be bygones. Live and let
live&mdash;"</p>

<p>Cass interrupted with a sharp, "I'll do whatever Jinny
says."</p>

<p>It was at the peaceful time of the evening. Jinny was reading a
new book filled with significant social trends and portents:
Dealings with the Firm of Dombey and Son, Wholesale, Retail, and
for Exportation. She was stroking the younger Cleo and, though she
had become an absolute Trappist as regards candy, she gave the
feeling that she was now and then confidently reaching for a
bon-bon.</p>

<p>Cass studied her contentment, and he spoke reluctantly: "Jin,
Bradd will be in town for a few hours tomorrow, and Roy wants us to
come for cocktails with him."</p>

<p>She stared. "I don't want to see him!" Her violence betrayed
that she was afraid to see him, that she longed to see him, that
she had to see him.</p>

<p>"I guess he's one fact we'd better face," said Cass
patiently.<br>
<br></p>

<p>In Dr. Drover's sun-room, with its pea-green wicker chairs,
there were eight people, all friends of Bradd, who with magnificent
tact played his role of Home Boy Who Went to the City and Made Good
but Will Never, Never Forget His Old Friends.</p>

<p>He kissed Queenie, Lillian, and Diantha on the cheek, and Rose
on the mouth, but with Jinny Timberlane he shook hands cordially,
exactly as he did with Jinny's reticent husband.</p>

<p>It seemed to Cass impossible that he could either have loved or
hated this fellow. He was too brisk, too obvious, too unfamiliar.
This was another Bradd. Success and the great city had claimed
him.</p>

<p>He was full of quips and of names which he considered famous. He
let them know how chummy he had become with a stock-broker, an
aviation magnate, a female columnist formerly a professional lady,
but he was not blown with all this social grandeur. He kept
yelling, "You don't see any Park Avenue dames as handsome as
Queenie," and "Let me know when you hit town, Rose, and I'll get
ringside seats for the opera."</p>

<p>After half an hour, Jinny said, "I'm afraid we'll have to go
home now."</p>

<p>They shook hands with Bradd and with everybody else available.
In the street, Cass said, "Well?"</p>

<p>"I know. Oh, darling, the man is a monkey, a monkey on a stick!
I'm so glad I saw him, though. I never really saw him before. That
charm-peddler! And I never really saw you before. Cass, I&mdash;
Don't you see what I'm trying to tell you?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>She was so serious that it was not till dinner that she said,
"And that was the <i>worst</i> tie he had on. Like these colored
pictures of vegetable soup. And I'll bet he spent nine dollars for
it. You'll never wear a tie like that!"<br>
<br></p>

<p>Late at night he awoke to find her standing in his doorway, a
moth against the light from the hall.</p>

<p>"I thought maybe you would come in and see me. I was very cold,"
she said plaintively. "Couldn't I crawl in your bed and get
warm?"</p>

<p>Then, for her and his love for her, he gave up his vested right
to be tragic, gave up pride and triumph and all the luxury of
submerged resentment, and smiled at her with the simplicity of a
baby.</p>

<p>"Dear Jinny!" he said, and she confided, "I'm going to get new
storm-windows on my room, even if I have to put them up myself. I
could, too! I'm the best storm-window fixer in this town. You'll
see!"</p>
