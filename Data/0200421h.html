<h2>An American Tragedy<br>
<br>
by<br>
<br>
Theodore Dreiser</h2>

<hr>

<h2>BOOK ONE</h2>

<h3>Chapter 1</h3>

<p>Dusk&mdash;of a summer night.</p>

<p>And the tall walls of the commercial heart of an American city
of perhaps 400,000 inhabitants&mdash;such walls as in time may
linger as a mere fable.</p>

<p>And up the broad street, now comparatively hushed, a little band
of six,&mdash;a man of about fifty, short, stout, with bushy hair
protruding from under a round black felt hat, a most
unimportant-looking person, who carried a small portable organ such
as is customarily used by street preachers and singers. And with
him a woman perhaps five years his junior, taller, not so broad,
but solid of frame and vigorous, very plain in face and dress, and
yet not homely, leading with one hand a small boy of seven and in
the other carrying a Bible and several hymn books. With these
three, but walking independently behind, was a girl of fifteen, a
boy of twelve and another girl of nine, all following obediently,
but not too enthusiastically, in the wake of the others.</p>

<p>It was hot, yet with a sweet languor about it all.</p>

<p>Crossing at right angles the great thoroughfare on which they
walked, was a second canyon-like way, threaded by throngs and
vehicles and various lines of cars which clanged their bells and
made such progress as they might amid swiftly moving streams of
traffic. Yet the little group seemed unconscious of anything save a
set purpose to make its way between the contending lines of traffic
and pedestrians which flowed by them.</p>

<p>Having reached an intersection this side of the second principal
thoroughfare&mdash;really just an alley between two tall
structures&mdash;now quite bare of life of any kind, the man put
down the organ, which the woman immediately opened, setting up a
music rack upon which she placed a wide flat hymn book. Then
handing the Bible to the man, she fell back in line with him, while
the twelve-year-old boy put down a small camp-stool in front of the
organ. The man&mdash;the father, as he chanced to be&mdash;looked
about him with seeming wide-eyed assurance, and announced, without
appearing to care whether he had any auditors or not:</p>

<p>"We will first sing a hymn of praise, so that any who may wish
to acknowledge the Lord may join us. Will you oblige, Hester?"</p>

<p>At this the eldest girl, who until now had attempted to appear
as unconscious and unaffected as possible, bestowed her rather slim
and as yet undeveloped figure upon the camp chair and turned the
leaves of the hymn book, pumping the organ while her mother
observed:</p>

<p>"I should think it might be nice to sing twenty-seven
tonight&mdash;'How Sweet the Balm of Jesus' Love.'"</p>

<p>By this time various homeward-bound individuals of diverse
grades and walks of life, noticing the small group disposing itself
in this fashion, hesitated for a moment to eye them askance or
paused to ascertain the character of their work. This hesitancy,
construed by the man apparently to constitute attention, however
mobile, was seized upon by him and he began addressing them as
though they were specifically here to hear him.</p>

<p>"Let us all sing twenty-seven, then&mdash;'How Sweet the Balm of
Jesus' Love.'"</p>

<p>At this the young girl began to interpret the melody upon the
organ, emitting a thin though correct strain, at the same time
joining her rather high soprano with that of her mother, together
with the rather dubious baritone of the father. The other children
piped weakly along, the boy and girl having taken hymn books from
the small pile stacked upon the organ. As they sang, this
nondescript and indifferent street audience gazed, held by the
peculiarity of such an unimportant-looking family publicly raising
its collective voice against the vast skepticism and apathy of
life. Some were interested or moved sympathetically by the rather
tame and inadequate figure of the girl at the organ, others by the
impractical and materially inefficient texture of the father, whose
weak blue eyes and rather flabby but poorly-clothed figure bespoke
more of failure than anything else. Of the group the mother alone
stood out as having that force and determination which, however
blind or erroneous, makes for self-preservation, if not success in
life. She, more than any of the others, stood up with an ignorant,
yet somehow respectable air of conviction. If you had watched her,
her hymn book dropped to her side, her glance directed straight
before her into space, you would have said: "Well, here is one who,
whatever her defects, probably does what she believes as nearly as
possible." A kind of hard, fighting faith in the wisdom and mercy
of that definite overruling and watchful power which she
proclaimed, was written in her every feature and gesture.</p>

<blockquote>"The love of Jesus saves me whole,<br>
The love of God my steps control,"</blockquote>

<p>she sang resonantly, if slightly nasally, between the towering
walls of the adjacent buildings.</p>

<p>The boy moved restlessly from one foot to the other, keeping his
eyes down, and for the most part only half singing. A tall and as
yet slight figure, surmounted by an interesting head and
face&mdash; white skin, dark hair&mdash;he seemed more keenly
observant and decidedly more sensitive than most of the
others&mdash;appeared indeed to resent and even to suffer from the
position in which he found himself. Plainly pagan rather than
religious, life interested him, although as yet he was not fully
aware of this. All that could be truly said of him now was that
there was no definite appeal in all this for him. He was too young,
his mind much too responsive to phases of beauty and pleasure which
had little, if anything, to do with the remote and cloudy romance
which swayed the minds of his mother and father.</p>

<p>Indeed the home life of which this boy found himself a part and
the various contacts, material and psychic, which thus far had been
his, did not tend to convince him of the reality and force of all
that his mother and father seemed so certainly to believe and say.
Rather, they seemed more or less troubled in their lives, at least
materially. His father was always reading the Bible and speaking in
meeting at different places, especially in the "mission," which he
and his mother conducted not so far from this corner. At the same
time, as he understood it, they collected money from various
interested or charitably inclined business men here and there who
appeared to believe in such philanthropic work. Yet the family was
always "hard up," never very well clothed, and deprived of many
comforts and pleasures which seemed common enough to others. And
his father and mother were constantly proclaiming the love and
mercy and care of God for him and for all. Plainly there was
something wrong somewhere. He could not get it all straight, but
still he could not help respecting his mother, a woman whose force
and earnestness, as well as her sweetness, appealed to him. Despite
much mission work and family cares, she managed to be fairly
cheerful, or at least sustaining, often declaring most emphatically
"God will provide" or "God will show the way," especially in times
of too great stress about food or clothes. Yet apparently, in spite
of this, as he and all the other children could see, God did not
show any very clear way, even though there was always an extreme
necessity for His favorable intervention in their affairs.</p>

<p>To-night, walking up the great street with his sisters and
brother, he wished that they need not do this any more, or at least
that he need not be a part of it. Other boys did not do such
things, and besides, somehow it seemed shabby and even degrading.
On more than one occasion, before he had been taken on the street
in this fashion, other boys had called to him and made fun of his
father, because he was always publicly emphasizing his religious
beliefs or convictions. Thus in one neighborhood in which they had
lived, when he was but a child of seven, his father, having always
preluded every conversation with "Praise the Lord," he heard boys
call "Here comes old Praise-the-Lord Griffiths." Or they would call
out after him "Hey, you're the fellow whose sister plays the organ.
Is there anything else she can play?"</p>

<p>"What does he always want to go around saying, 'Praise the Lord'
for? Other people don't do it."</p>

<p>It was that old mass yearning for a likeness in all things that
troubled them, and him. Neither his father nor his mother was like
other people, because they were always making so much of religion,
and now at last they were making a business of it.</p>

<p>On this night in this great street with its cars and crowds and
tall buildings, he felt ashamed, dragged out of normal life, to be
made a show and jest of. The handsome automobiles that sped by, the
loitering pedestrians moving off to what interests and comforts he
could only surmise; the gay pairs of young people, laughing and
jesting and the "kids" staring, all troubled him with a sense of
something different, better, more beautiful than his, or rather
their life.</p>

<p>And now units of this vagrom and unstable street throng, which
was forever shifting and changing about them, seemed to sense the
psychologic error of all this in so far as these children were
concerned, for they would nudge one another, the more sophisticated
and indifferent lifting an eyebrow and smiling contemptuously, the
more sympathetic or experienced commenting on the useless presence
of these children.</p>

<p>"I see these people around here nearly every night now&mdash;two
or three times a week, anyhow," this from a young clerk who had
just met his girl and was escorting her toward a restaurant.
"They're just working some religious dodge or other, I guess."</p>

<p>"That oldest boy don't wanta be here. He feels outa place, I can
see that. It ain't right to make a kid like that come out unless he
wants to. He can't understand all this stuff, anyhow." This from an
idler and loafer of about forty, one of those odd hangers-on about
the commercial heart of a city, addressing a pausing and seemingly
amiable stranger.</p>

<p>"Yeh, I guess that's so," the other assented, taking in the
peculiar cast of the boy's head and face. In view of the uneasy and
self-conscious expression upon the face whenever it was lifted, one
might have intelligently suggested that it was a little unkind as
well as idle to thus publicly force upon a temperament as yet
unfitted to absorb their import, religious and psychic services
best suited to reflective temperaments of maturer years.</p>

<p>Yet so it was.</p>

<p>As for the remainder of the family, both the youngest girl and
boy were too small to really understand much of what it was all
about or to care. The eldest girl at the organ appeared not so much
to mind, as to enjoy the attention and comment her presence and
singing evoked, for more than once, not only strangers, but her
mother and father, had assured her that she had an appealing and
compelling voice, which was only partially true. It was not a good
voice. They did not really understand music. Physically, she was of
a pale, emasculate and unimportant structure, with no real mental
force or depth, and was easily made to feel that this was an
excellent field in which to distinguish herself and attract a
little attention. As for the parents, they were determined upon
spiritualizing the world as much as possible, and, once the hymn
was concluded, the father launched into one of those hackneyed
descriptions of the delights of a release, via self-realization of
the mercy of God and the love of Christ and the will of God toward
sinners, from the burdensome cares of an evil conscience.</p>

<p>"All men are sinners in the light of the Lord," he declared.
"Unless they repent, unless they accept Christ, His love and
forgiveness of them, they can never know the happiness of being
spiritually whole and clean. Oh, my friends! If you could but know
the peace and content that comes with the knowledge, the inward
understanding, that Christ lived and died for you and that He walks
with you every day and hour, by light and by dark, at dawn and at
dusk, to keep and strengthen you for the tasks and cares of the
world that are ever before you. Oh, the snares and pitfalls that
beset us all! And then the soothing realization that Christ is ever
with us, to counsel, to aid, to hearten, to bind up our wounds and
make us whole! Oh, the peace, the satisfaction, the comfort, the
glory of that!"</p>

<p>"Amen!" asseverated his wife, and the daughter, Hester, or Esta,
as she was called by the family, moved by the need of as much
public support as possible for all of them&mdash;echoed it after
her.</p>

<p>Clyde, the eldest boy, and the two younger children merely gazed
at the ground, or occasionally at their father, with a feeling that
possibly it was all true and important, yet somehow not as
significant or inviting as some of the other things which life
held. They heard so much of this, and to their young and eager
minds life was made for something more than street and mission hall
protestations of this sort.</p>

<p>Finally, after a second hymn and an address by Mrs. Griffiths,
during which she took occasion to refer to the mission work jointly
conducted by them in a near-by street, and their services to the
cause of Christ in general, a third hymn was indulged in, and then
some tracts describing the mission rescue work being distributed,
such voluntary gifts as were forthcoming were taken up by
Asa&mdash;the father. The small organ was closed, the camp chair
folded up and given to Clyde, the Bible and hymn books picked up by
Mrs. Griffiths, and with the organ supported by a leather strap
passed over the shoulder of Griffiths, senior, the missionward
march was taken up.</p>

<p>During all this time Clyde was saying to himself that he did not
wish to do this any more, that he and his parents looked foolish
and less than normal&mdash;"cheap" was the word he would have used
if he could have brought himself to express his full measure of
resentment at being compelled to participate in this way&mdash;and
that he would not do it any more if he could help. What good did it
do them to have him along? His life should not be like this. Other
boys did not have to do as he did. He meditated now more
determinedly than ever a rebellion by which he would rid himself of
the need of going out in this way. Let his elder sister go if she
chose; she liked it. His younger sister and brother might be too
young to care. But he&mdash;</p>

<p>"They seemed a little more attentive than usual to-night, I
thought," commented Griffiths to his wife as they walked along, the
seductive quality of the summer evening air softening him into a
more generous interpretation of the customary indifferent spirit of
the passer-by.</p>

<p>"Yes; twenty-seven took tracts to-night as against eighteen on
Thursday."</p>

<p>"The love of Christ must eventually prevail," comforted the
father, as much to hearten himself as his wife. "The pleasures and
cares of the world hold a very great many, but when sorrow
overtakes them, then some of these seeds will take root."</p>

<p>"I am sure of it. That is the thought which always keeps me up.
Sorrow and the weight of sin eventually bring some of them to see
the error of their way."</p>

<p>They now entered into the narrow side street from which they had
emerged and walking as many as a dozen doors from the corner,
entered the door of a yellow single-story wooden building, the
large window and the two glass panes in the central door of which
had been painted a gray-white. Across both windows and the smaller
panels in the double door had been painted: "The Door of Hope.
Bethel Independent Mission. Meetings Every Wednesday and Saturday
night, 8 to 10. Sundays at 11, 3 and 8. Everybody Welcome." Under
this legend on each window were printed the words: "God is Love,"
and below this again, in smaller type: "How Long Since You Wrote to
Mother?"</p>

<p>The small company entered the yellow unprepossessing door and
disappeared.</p>

<h3>Chapter 2</h3>

<p>That such a family, thus cursorily presented, might have a
different and somewhat peculiar history could well be anticipated,
and it would be true. Indeed, this one presented one of those
anomalies of psychic and social reflex and motivation such as would
tax the skill of not only the psychologist but the chemist and
physicist as well, to unravel. To begin with, Asa Griffiths, the
father, was one of those poorly integrated and correlated
organisms, the product of an environment and a religious theory,
but with no guiding or mental insight of his own, yet sensitive and
therefore highly emotional and without any practical sense
whatsoever. Indeed it would be hard to make clear just how life
appealed to him, or what the true hue of his emotional responses
was. On the other hand, as has been indicated, his wife was of a
firmer texture but with scarcely any truer or more practical
insight into anything.</p>

<p>The history of this man and his wife is of no particular
interest here save as it affected their boy of twelve, Clyde
Griffiths. This youth, aside from a certain emotionalism and exotic
sense of romance which characterized him, and which he took more
from his father than from his mother, brought a more vivid and
intelligent imagination to things, and was constantly thinking of
how he might better himself, if he had a chance; places to which he
might go, things he might see, and how differently he might live,
if only this, that and the other things were true. The principal
thing that troubled Clyde up to his fifteenth year, and for long
after in retrospect, was that the calling or profession of his
parents was the shabby thing that it appeared to be in the eyes of
others. For so often throughout his youth in different cities in
which his parents had conducted a mission or spoken on the
streets&mdash;Grand Rapids, Detroit, Milwaukee, Chicago, lastly
Kansas City&mdash;it had been obvious that people, at least the
boys and girls he encountered, looked down upon him and his
brothers and sisters for being the children of such parents. On
several occasions, and much against the mood of his parents, who
never countenanced such exhibitions of temper, he had stopped to
fight with one or another of these boys. But always, beaten or
victorious, he had been conscious of the fact that the work his
parents did was not satisfactory to others,&mdash;shabby, trivial.
And always he was thinking of what he would do, once he reached the
place where he could get away.</p>

<p>For Clyde's parents had proved impractical in the matter of the
future of their children. They did not understand the importance or
the essential necessity for some form of practical or professional
training for each and every one of their young ones. Instead, being
wrapped up in the notion of evangelizing the world, they had
neglected to keep their children in school in any one place. They
had moved here and there, sometimes in the very midst of an
advantageous school season, because of a larger and better
religious field in which to work. And there were times, when, the
work proving highly unprofitable and Asa being unable to make much
money at the two things he most understood&mdash;gardening and
canvassing for one invention or another&mdash;they were quite
without sufficient food or decent clothes, and the children could
not go to school. In the face of such situations as these, whatever
the children might think, Asa and his wife remained as optimistic
as ever, or they insisted to themselves that they were, and had
unwavering faith in the Lord and His intention to provide.</p>

<p>The combination home and mission which this family occupied was
dreary enough in most of its phases to discourage the average youth
or girl of any spirit. It consisted in its entirety of one long
store floor in an old and decidedly colorless and inartistic wooden
building which was situated in that part of Kansas City which lies
north of Independence Boulevard and west of Troost Avenue, the
exact street or place being called Bickel, a very short
thoroughfare opening off Missouri Avenue, a somewhat more lengthy
but no less nondescript highway. And the entire neighborhood in
which it stood was very faintly and yet not agreeably redolent of a
commercial life which had long since moved farther south, if not
west. It was some five blocks from the spot on which twice a week
the open air meetings of these religious enthusiasts and
proselytizers were held.</p>

<p>And it was the ground floor of this building, looking out into
Bickel Street at the front and some dreary back yards of equally
dreary frame houses, which was divided at the front into a hall
forty by twenty-five feet in size, in which had been placed some
sixty collapsible wood chairs, a lectern, a map of Palestine or the
Holy Land, and for wall decorations some twenty-five printed but
unframed mottoes which read in part:</p>

<p>"WINE IS A MOCKER, STRONG DRINK IS RAGING AND WHOSOEVER IS
DECEIVED THEREBY IS NOT WISE."</p>

<p>"TAKE HOLD OF SHIELD AND BUCKLER, AND STAND UP FOR MINE HELP."
PSALMS 35:2.</p>

<p>"AND YE, MY FLOCK, THE FLOCK OF MY PASTURE, are men, AND I AM
YOUR GOD, SAITH THE LORD GOD." EZEKIEL 34:31.</p>

<p>"O GOD, THOU KNOWEST MY FOOLISHNESS, AND MY SINS ARE NOT HID
FROM THEE." PSALMS 69:5.</p>

<p>"IF YE HAVE FAITH AS A GRAIN OF MUSTARD SEED, YE SHALL SAY UNTO
THIS MOUNTAIN, REMOVE HENCE TO YONDER PLACE; AND IT SHALL MOVE; AND
NOTHING SHALL BE IMPOSSIBLE TO YOU." MATTHEW 17:20.</p>

<p>"FOR THE DAY OF THE LORD IS NEAR." OBADIAH 15.</p>

<p>"FOR THERE SHALL BE NO REWARD TO THE EVIL MAN." PROVERBS
24:20.</p>

<p>"LOOK, THEN, NOT UPON THE WINE WHEN IT IS RED: IT BITETH LIKE A
SERPENT, AND STINGETH LIKE AN ADDER." PROVERBS 23:31,32.</p>

<p>These mighty adjurations were as silver and gold plates set in a
wall of dross.</p>

<p>The rear forty feet of this very commonplace floor was
intricately and yet neatly divided into three small bedrooms, a
living room which overlooked the backyard and wooden fences of
yards no better than those at the back; also, a combination kitchen
and dining room exactly ten feet square, and a store room for
mission tracts, hymnals, boxes, trunks and whatever else of
non-immediate use, but of assumed value, which the family owned.
This particular small room lay immediately to the rear of the
mission hall itself, and into it before or after speaking or at
such times as a conference seemed important, both Mr. and Mrs.
Griffiths were wont to retire&mdash; also at times to meditate or
pray.</p>

<p>How often had Clyde and his sisters and younger brother seen his
mother or father, or both, in conference with some derelict or
semi-repentant soul who had come for advice or aid, most usually
for aid. And here at times, when his mother's and father's
financial difficulties were greatest, they were to be found
thinking, or as Asa Griffiths was wont helplessly to say at times,
"praying their way out," a rather ineffectual way, as Clyde began
to think later.</p>

<p>And the whole neighborhood was so dreary and run-down that he
hated the thought of living in it, let alone being part of a work
that required constant appeals for aid, as well as constant prayer
and thanksgiving to sustain it.</p>

<p>Mrs. Elvira Griffiths before she had married Asa had been
nothing but an ignorant farm girl, brought up without much thought
of religion of any kind. But having fallen in love with him, she
had become inoculated with the virus of Evangelism and
proselytizing which dominated him, and had followed him gladly and
enthusiastically in all of his ventures and through all of his
vagaries. Being rather flattered by the knowledge that she could
speak and sing, her ability to sway and persuade and control people
with the "word of God," as she saw it, she had become more or less
pleased with herself on this account and so persuaded to
continue.</p>

<p>Occasionally a small band of people followed the preachers to
their mission, or learning of its existence through their street
work, appeared there later&mdash;those odd and mentally disturbed
or distrait souls who are to be found in every place. And it had
been Clyde's compulsory duty throughout the years when he could not
act for himself to be in attendance at these various meetings. And
always he had been more irritated than favorably influenced by the
types of men and women who came here&mdash;mostly
men&mdash;down-and-out laborers, loafers, drunkards, wastrels, the
botched and helpless who seemed to drift in, because they had no
other place to go. And they were always testifying as to how God or
Christ or Divine Grace had rescued them from this or that
predicament&mdash;never how they had rescued any one else. And
always his father and mother were saying "Amen" and "Glory to God,"
and singing hymns and afterward taking up a collection for the
legitimate expenses of the hall&mdash; collections which, as he
surmised, were little enough&mdash;barely enough to keep the
various missions they had conducted in existence.</p>

<p>The one thing that really interested him in connection with his
parents was the existence somewhere in the east&mdash;in a small
city called Lycurgus, near Utica he understood&mdash;of an uncle, a
brother of his father's, who was plainly different from all this.
That uncle&mdash;Samuel Griffiths by name&mdash;was rich. In one
way and another, from casual remarks dropped by his parents, Clyde
had heard references to certain things this particular uncle might
do for a person, if he but would; references to the fact that he
was a shrewd, hard business man; that he had a great house and a
large factory in Lycurgus for the manufacture of collars and
shirts, which employed not less than three hundred people; that he
had a son who must be about Clyde's age, and several daughters, two
at least, all of whom must be, as Clyde imagined, living in luxury
in Lycurgus. News of all this had apparently been brought west in
some way by people who knew Asa and his father and brother. As
Clyde pictured this uncle, he must be a kind of Croesus, living in
ease and luxury there in the east, while here in the
west&mdash;Kansas City&mdash;he and his parents and his brother and
sisters were living in the same wretched and hum-drum,
hand-to-mouth state that had always characterized their lives.</p>

<p>But for this&mdash;apart from anything he might do for himself,
as he early began to see&mdash;there was no remedy. For at fifteen,
and even a little earlier, Clyde began to understand that his
education, as well as his sisters' and brother's, had been sadly
neglected. And it would be rather hard for him to overcome this
handicap, seeing that other boys and girls with more money and
better homes were being trained for special kinds of work. How was
one to get a start under such circumstances? Already when, at the
age of thirteen, fourteen and fifteen, he began looking in the
papers, which, being too worldly, had never been admitted to his
home, he found that mostly skilled help was wanted, or boys to
learn trades in which at the moment he was not very much
interested. For true to the standard of the American youth, or the
general American attitude toward life, he felt himself above the
type of labor which was purely manual. What! Run a machine, lay
bricks, learn to be a carpenter, or a plasterer, or plumber, when
boys no better than himself were clerks and druggists' assistants
and bookkeepers and assistants in banks and real estate offices and
such! Wasn't it menial, as miserable as the life he had thus far
been leading, to wear old clothes and get up so early in the
morning and do all the commonplace things such people had to
do?</p>

<p>For Clyde was as vain and proud as he was poor. He was one of
those interesting individuals who looked upon himself as a thing
apart&mdash;never quite wholly and indissolubly merged with the
family of which he was a member, and never with any profound
obligations to those who had been responsible for his coming into
the world. On the contrary, he was inclined to study his parents,
not too sharply or bitterly, but with a very fair grasp of their
qualities and capabilities. And yet, with so much judgment in that
direction, he was never quite able&mdash;at least not until he had
reached his sixteenth year&mdash;to formulate any policy in regard
to himself, and then only in a rather fumbling and tentative
way.</p>

<p>Incidentally by that time the sex lure or appeal had begun to
manifest itself and he was already intensely interested and
troubled by the beauty of the opposite sex, its attractions for him
and his attraction for it. And, naturally and coincidentally, the
matter of his clothes and his physical appearance had begun to
trouble him not a little&mdash;how he looked and how other boys
looked. It was painful to him now to think that his clothes were
not right; that he was not as handsome as he might be, not as
interesting. What a wretched thing it was to be born poor and not
to have any one to do anything for you and not to be able to do so
very much for yourself!</p>

<p>Casual examination of himself in mirrors whenever he found them
tended rather to assure him that he was not so bad-looking&mdash;a
straight, well-cut nose, high white forehead, wavy, glossy, black
hair, eyes that were black and rather melancholy at times. And yet
the fact that his family was the unhappy thing that it was, that he
had never had any real friends, and could not have any, as he saw
it, because of the work and connection of his parents, was now
tending more and more to induce a kind of mental depression or
melancholia which promised not so well for his future. It served to
make him rebellious and hence lethargic at times. Because of his
parents, and in spite of his looks, which were really agreeable and
more appealing than most, he was inclined to misinterpret the
interested looks which were cast at him occasionally by young girls
in very different walks of life from him&mdash;the contemptuous and
yet rather inviting way in which they looked to see if he were
interested or disinterested, brave or cowardly.</p>

<p>And yet, before he had ever earned any money at all, he had
always told himself that if only he had a better collar, a nicer
shirt, finer shoes, a good suit, a swell overcoat like some boys
had! Oh, the fine clothes, the handsome homes, the watches, rings,
pins that some boys sported; the dandies many youths of his years
already were! Some parents of boys of his years actually gave them
cars of their own to ride in. They were to be seen upon the
principal streets of Kansas City flitting to and fro like flies.
And pretty girls with them. And he had nothing. And he never had
had.</p>

<p>And yet the world was so full of so many things to do&mdash;so
many people were so happy and so successful. What was he to do?
Which way to turn? What one thing to take up and
master&mdash;something that would get him somewhere. He could not
say. He did not know exactly. And these peculiar parents were in no
way sufficiently equipped to advise him.</p>

<h3>Chapter 3</h3>

<p>One of the things that served to darken Clyde's mood just about
the time when he was seeking some practical solution for himself,
to say nothing of its profoundly disheartening effect on the
Griffiths family as a whole, was the fact that his sister Esta, in
whom he took no little interest (although they really had very
little in common), ran away from home with an actor who happened to
be playing in Kansas City and who took a passing fancy for her.</p>

<p>The truth in regard to Esta was that in spite of her guarded
up-bringing, and the seeming religious and moral fervor which at
times appeared to characterize her, she was just a sensuous, weak
girl who did not by any means know yet what she thought. Despite
the atmosphere in which she moved, essentially she was not of it.
Like the large majority of those who profess and daily repeat the
dogmas and creeds of the world, she had come into her practices and
imagined attitude so insensibly from her earliest childhood on,
that up to this time, and even later, she did not know the meaning
of it all. For the necessity of thought had been obviated by advice
and law, or "revealed" truth, and so long as other theories or
situations and impulses of an external or even internal, character
did not arise to clash with these, she was safe enough. Once they
did, however, it was a foregone conclusion that her religious
notions, not being grounded on any conviction or temperamental bias
of her own, were not likely to withstand the shock. So that all the
while, and not unlike her brother Clyde, her thoughts as well as
her emotions were wandering here and there&mdash; to love, to
comfort&mdash;to things which in the main had little, if anything,
to do with any self-abnegating and self-immolating religious
theory. Within her was a chemism of dreams which somehow
counteracted all they had to say.</p>

<p>Yet she had neither Clyde's force, nor, on the other hand, his
resistance. She was in the main a drifter, with a vague yearning
toward pretty dresses, hats, shoes, ribbons and the like, and
super-imposed above this, the religious theory or notion that she
should not be. There were the long bright streets of a morning and
afternoon after school or of an evening. The charm of certain girls
swinging along together, arms locked, secrets a-whispering, or that
of boys, clownish, yet revealing through their bounding ridiculous
animality the force and meaning of that chemistry and urge toward
mating which lies back of all youthful thought and action. And in
herself, as from time to time she observed lovers or
flirtation-seekers who lingered at street corners or about
doorways, and who looked at her in a longing and seeking way, there
was a stirring, a nerve plasm palpitation that spoke loudly for all
the seemingly material things of life, not for the thin
pleasantries of heaven.</p>

<p>And the glances drilled her like an invisible ray, for she was
pleasing to look at and was growing more attractive hourly. And the
moods in others awakened responsive moods in her, those rearranging
chemisms upon which all the morality or immorality of the world is
based.</p>

<p>And then one day, as she was coming home from school, a youth of
that plausible variety known as "masher" engaged her in
conversation, largely because of a look and a mood which seemed to
invite it. And there was little to stay her, for she was
essentially yielding, if not amorous. Yet so great had been her
home drilling as to the need of modesty, circumspection, purity and
the like, that on this occasion at least there was no danger of any
immediate lapse. Only this attack once made, others followed, were
accepted, or not so quickly fled from, and by degrees, these served
to break down that wall of reserve which her home training had
served to erect. She became secretive and hid her ways from her
parents.</p>

<p>Youths occasionally walked and talked with her in spite of
herself. They demolished that excessive shyness which had been
hers, and which had served to put others aside for a time at least.
She wished for other contacts&mdash;dreamed of some bright, gay,
wonderful love of some kind, with some one.</p>

<p>Finally, after a slow but vigorous internal growth of mood and
desire, there came this actor, one of those vain, handsome, animal
personalities, all clothes and airs, but no morals (no taste, no
courtesy or real tenderness even), but of compelling magnetism, who
was able within the space of one brief week and a few meetings to
completely befuddle and enmesh her so that she was really his to do
with as he wished. And the truth was that he scarcely cared for her
at all. To him, dull as he was, she was just another girl&mdash;
fairly pretty, obviously sensuous and inexperienced, a silly who
could be taken by a few soft words&mdash;a show of seemingly
sincere affection, talk of the opportunity of a broader, freer life
on the road, in other great cities, as his wife.</p>

<p>And yet his words were those of a lover who would be true
forever. All she had to do, as he explained to her, was to come
away with him and be his bride, at once&mdash;now. Delay was so
vain when two such as they had met. There was difficulty about
marriage here, which he could not explain&mdash;it related to
friends&mdash;but in St. Louis he had a preacher friend who would
wed them. She was to have new and better clothes than she had ever
known, delicious adventures, love. She would travel with him and
see the great world. She would never need to trouble more about
anything save him; and while it was truth to her&mdash;the verbal
surety of a genuine passion&mdash;to him it was the most ancient
and serviceable type of blarney, often used before and often
successful.</p>

<p>In a single week then, at odd hours, morning, afternoon and
night, this chemic witchery was accomplished.</p>

<p>Coming home rather late one Saturday night in April from a walk
which he had taken about the business heart, in order to escape the
regular Saturday night mission services, Clyde found his mother and
father worried about the whereabouts of Esta. She had played and
sung as usual at this meeting. And all had seemed all right with
her. After the meeting she had gone to her room, saying that she
was not feeling very well and was going to bed early. But by eleven
o'clock, when Clyde returned, her mother had chanced to look into
her room and discovered that she was not there nor anywhere about
the place. A certain bareness in connection with the room&mdash;
some trinkets and dresses removed, an old and familiar suitcase
gone&mdash;had first attracted her mother's attention. Then the
house search proving that she was not there, Asa had gone outside
to look up and down the street. She sometimes walked out alone, or
sat or stood in front of the mission during its idle or closed
hours.</p>

<p>This search revealing nothing, Clyde and he had walked to a
corner, then along Missouri Avenue. No Esta. At twelve they
returned and after that, naturally, the curiosity in regard to her
grew momentarily sharper.</p>

<p>At first they assumed that she might have taken an unexplained
walk somewhere, but as twelve-thirty, and finally one, and
one-thirty, passed, and no Esta, they were about to notify the
police, when Clyde, going into her room, saw a note pinned to the
pillow of her small wooden bed&mdash;a missive that had escaped the
eye of his mother. At once he went to it, curious and
comprehending, for he had often wondered in what way, assuming that
he ever wished to depart surreptitiously, he would notify his
parents, for he knew they would never countenance his departure
unless they were permitted to supervise it in every detail. And now
here was Esta missing, and here was undoubtedly some such
communication as he might have left. He picked it up, eager to read
it, but at that moment his mother came into the room and, seeing it
in his hand, exclaimed: "What's that? A note? Is it from her?" He
surrendered it and she unfolded it, reading it quickly. He noted
that her strong broad face, always tanned a reddish brown, blanched
as she turned away toward the outer room. Her biggish mouth was now
set in a firm, straight line. Her large, strong hand shook the
least bit as it held the small note aloft.</p>

<p>"Asa!" she called, and then tramping into the next room where he
was, his frizzled grayish hair curling distractedly above his round
head, she said: "Read this."</p>

<p>Clyde, who had followed, saw him take it a little nervously in
his pudgy hands, his lips, always weak and beginning to crinkle at
the center with age, now working curiously. Any one who had known
his life's history would have said it was the expression, slightly
emphasized, with which he had received most of the untoward blows
of his life in the past.</p>

<p>"Tst! Tst! Tst!" was the only sound he made at first, a sucking
sound of the tongue and palate&mdash;most weak and inadequate, it
seemed to Clyde. Next there was another "Tst! Tst! Tst!", his head
beginning to shake from side to side. Then, "Now, what do you
suppose could have caused her to do that?" Then he turned and gazed
at his wife, who gazed blankly in return. Then, walking to and fro,
his hands behind him, his short legs taking unconscious and queerly
long steps, his head moving again, he gave vent to another
ineffectual "Tst! Tst! Tst!"</p>

<p>Always the more impressive, Mrs. Griffiths now showed herself
markedly different and more vital in this trying situation, a kind
of irritation or dissatisfaction with life itself, along with an
obvious physical distress, seeming to pass through her like a
visible shadow. Once her husband had gotten up, she reached out and
took the note, then merely glared at it again, her face set in hard
yet stricken and disturbing lines. Her manner was that of one who
is intensely disquieted and dissatisfied, one who fingers savagely
at a material knot and yet cannot undo it, one who seeks restraint
and freedom from complaint and yet who would complain bitterly,
angrily. For behind her were all those years of religious work and
faith, which somehow, in her poorly integrated conscience, seemed
dimly to indicate that she should justly have been spared this.
Where was her God, her Christ, at this hour when this obvious evil
was being done? Why had He not acted for her? How was He to explain
this? His Biblical promises! His perpetual guidance! His declared
mercies!</p>

<p>In the face of so great a calamity, it was very hard for her, as
Clyde could see, to get this straightened out, instantly at least.
Although, as Clyde had come to know, it could be done eventually,
of course. For in some blind, dualistic way both she and Asa
insisted, as do all religionists, in disassociating God from harm
and error and misery, while granting Him nevertheless supreme
control. They would seek for something else&mdash;some malign,
treacherous, deceiving power which, in the face of God's
omniscience and omnipotence, still beguiles and betrays&mdash;and
find it eventually in the error and perverseness of the human
heart, which God has made, yet which He does not control, because
He does not want to control it.</p>

<p>At the moment, however, only hurt and rage were with her, and
yet her lips did not twitch as did Asa's, nor did her eyes show
that profound distress which filled his. Instead she retreated a
step and reexamined the letter, almost angrily, then said to Asa:
"She's run away with some one and she doesn't say&mdash;" Then she
stopped suddenly, remembering the presence of the
children&mdash;Clyde, Julia, and Frank, all present and all gazing
curiously, intently, unbelievingly. "Come in here," she called to
her husband, "I want to talk to you a minute. You children had
better go on to bed. We'll be out in a minute."</p>

<p>With Asa then she retired quite precipitately to a small room
back of the mission hall. They heard her click the electric bulb.
Then their voices were heard in low converse, while Clyde and Julia
and Frank looked at each other, although Frank, being so
young&mdash;only ten&mdash;could scarcely be said to have
comprehended fully. Even Julia hardly gathered the full import of
it. But Clyde, because of his larger contact with life and his
mother's statement ("She's run away with some one"), understood
well enough. Esta had tired of all this, as had he. Perhaps there
was some one, like one of those dandies whom he saw on the streets
with the prettiest girls, with whom she had gone. But where? And
what was he like? That note told something, and yet his mother had
not let him see it. She had taken it away too quickly. If only he
had looked first, silently and to himself!</p>

<p>"Do you suppose she's run away for good?" he asked Julia
dubiously, the while his parents were out of the room, Julia
herself looking so blank and strange.</p>

<p>"How should I know?" she replied a little irritably, troubled by
her parents' distress and this secretiveness, as well as Esta's
action. "She never said anything to me. I should think she'd be
ashamed of herself if she has."</p>

<p>Julia, being colder emotionally than either Esta or Clyde, was
more considerate of her parents in a conventional way, and hence
sorrier. True, she did not quite gather what it meant, but she
suspected something, for she had talked occasionally with girls,
but in a very guarded and conservative way. Now, however, it was
more the way in which Esta had chosen to leave, deserting her
parents and her brothers and herself, that caused her to be angry
with her, for why should she go and do anything which would
distress her parents in this dreadful fashion. It was dreadful. The
air was thick with misery.</p>

<p>And as his parents talked in their little room, Clyde brooded
too, for he was intensely curious about life now. What was it Esta
had really done? Was it, as he feared and thought, one of those
dreadful runaway or sexually disagreeable affairs which the boys on
the streets and at school were always slyly talking about? How
shameful, if that were true! She might never come back. She had
gone with some man. There was something wrong about that, no doubt,
for a girl, anyhow, for all he had ever heard was that all decent
contacts between boys and girls, men and women, led to but one
thing&mdash;marriage. And now Esta, in addition to their other
troubles, had gone and done this. Certainly this home life of
theirs was pretty dark now, and it would be darker instead of
brighter because of this.</p>

<p>Presently the parents came out, and then Mrs. Griffiths' face,
if still set and constrained, was somehow a little different, less
savage perhaps, more hopelessly resigned.</p>

<p>"Esta's seen fit to leave us, for a little while, anyhow," was
all she said at first, seeing the children waiting curiously. "Now,
you're not to worry about her at all, or think any more about it.
She'll come back after a while, I'm sure. She has chosen to go her
own way, for a time, for some reason. The Lord's will be done."
("Blessed be the name of the Lord!" interpolated Asa.) "I thought
she was happy here with us, but apparently she wasn't. She must see
something of the world for herself, I suppose." (Here Asa put in
another Tst! Tst! Tst!) "But we mustn't harbor hard thoughts. That
won't do any good now&mdash;only thoughts of love and kindness."
Yet she said this with a kind of sternness that somehow belied
it&mdash; a click of the voice, as it were. "We can only hope that
she will soon see how foolish she has been, and unthinking, and
come back. She can't prosper on the course she's going now. It
isn't the Lord's way or will. She's too young and she's made a
mistake. But we can forgive her. We must. Our hearts must be kept
open, soft and tender." She talked as though she were addressing a
meeting, but with a hard, sad, frozen face and voice. "Now, all of
you go to bed. We can only pray now, and hope, morning, noon and
night, that no evil will befall her. I wish she hadn't done that,"
she added, quite out of keeping with the rest of her statement and
really not thinking of the children as present at all&mdash;just of
Esta.</p>

<p>But Asa!</p>

<p>Such a father, as Clyde often thought, afterwards.</p>

<p>Apart from his own misery, he seemed only to note and be
impressed by the more significant misery of his wife. During all
this, he had stood foolishly to one side&mdash;short, gray,
frizzled, inadequate.</p>

<p>"Well, blessed be the name of the Lord," he interpolated from
time to time. "We must keep our hearts open. Yes, we mustn't judge.
We must only hope for the best. Yes, yes! Praise the Lord&mdash;we
must praise the Lord! Amen! Oh, yes! Tst! Tst! Tst!"</p>

<p>"If any one asks where she is," continued Mrs. Griffiths after a
time, quite ignoring her spouse and addressing the children, who
had drawn near her, "we will say that she has gone on a visit to
some of my relatives back in Tonawanda. That won't be the truth,
exactly, but then we don't know where she is or what the truth
is&mdash; and she may come back. So we must not say or do anything
that will injure her until we know."</p>

<p>"Yes, praise the Lord!" called Asa, feebly.</p>

<p>"So if any one should inquire at any time, until we know, we
will say that."</p>

<p>"Sure," put in Clyde, helpfully, and Julia added, "All
right."</p>

<p>Mrs. Griffiths paused and looked firmly and yet apologetically
at her children. Asa, for his part, emitted another "Tst! Tst!
Tst!" and then the children were waved to bed.</p>

<p>At that, Clyde, who really wanted to know what Esta's letter had
said, but was convinced from long experience that his mother would
not let him know unless she chose, returned to his room again, for
he was tired. Why didn't they search more if there was hope of
finding her? Where was she now&mdash;at this minute? On some train
somewhere? Evidently she didn't want to be found. She was probably
dissatisfied, just as he was. Here he was, thinking so recently of
going away somewhere himself, wondering how the family would take
it, and now she had gone before him. How would that affect his
point of view and action in the future? Truly, in spite of his
father's and mother's misery, he could not see that her going was
such a calamity, not from the <i>going</i> point of view, at any
rate. It was only another something which hinted that things were
not right here. Mission work was nothing. All this religious
emotion and talk was not so much either. It hadn't saved Esta.
Evidently, like himself, she didn't believe so much in it,
either.</p>

<h3>Chapter 4</h3>

<p>The effect of this particular conclusion was to cause Clyde to
think harder than ever about himself. And the principal result of
his thinking was that he must do something for himself and soon. Up
to this time the best he had been able to do was to work at such
odd jobs as befall all boys between their twelfth and fifteenth
years: assisting a man who had a paper route during the summer
months of one year, working in the basement of a five-and-ten-cent
store all one summer long, and on Saturdays, for a period during
the winter, opening boxes and unpacking goods, for which he
received the munificent sum of five dollars a week, a sum which at
the time seemed almost a fortune. He felt himself rich and, in the
face of the opposition of his parents, who were opposed to the
theater and motion pictures also, as being not only worldly, but
sinful, he could occasionally go to one or another of
those&mdash;in the gallery&mdash;a form of diversion which he had
to conceal from his parents. Yet that did not deter him. He felt
that he had a right to go with his own money; also to take his
younger brother Frank, who was glad enough to go with him and say
nothing.</p>

<p>Later in the same year, wishing to get out of school because he
already felt himself very much belated in the race, he secured a
place as an assistant to a soda water clerk in one of the cheaper
drug stores of the city, which adjoined a theater and enjoyed not a
little patronage of this sort. A sign&mdash;"Boy
Wanted"&mdash;since it was directly on his way to school, first
interested him. Later, in conversation with the young man whose
assistant he was to be, and from whom he was to learn the trade,
assuming that he was sufficiently willing and facile, he gathered
that if he mastered this art, he might make as much as fifteen and
even eighteen dollars a week. It was rumored that Stroud's at the
corner of 14th and Baltimore streets paid that much to two of their
clerks. The particular store to which he was applying paid only
twelve, the standard salary of most places.</p>

<p>But to acquire this art, as he was now informed, required time
and the friendly help of an expert. If he wished to come here and
work for five to begin with&mdash;well, six, then, since his face
fell&mdash;he might soon expect to know a great deal about the art
of mixing sweet drinks and decorating a large variety of ice creams
with liquid sweets, thus turning them into sundaes. For the time
being apprenticeship meant washing and polishing all the machinery
and implements of this particular counter, to say nothing of
opening and sweeping out the store at so early an hour as
seven-thirty, dusting, and delivering such orders as the owner of
this drug store chose to send out by him. At such idle moments as
his immediate superior&mdash;a Mr. Sieberling&mdash;twenty,
dashing, self-confident, talkative, was too busy to fill all the
orders, he might be called upon to mix such minor
drinks&mdash;lemonades, Coca-Colas and the like&mdash; as the trade
demanded.</p>

<p>Yet this interesting position, after due consultation with his
mother, he decided to take. For one thing, it would provide him, as
he suspected, with all the ice-cream sodas he desired,
free&mdash;an advantage not to be disregarded. In the next place,
as he saw it at the time, it was an open door to a
trade&mdash;something which he lacked. Further, and not at all
disadvantageously as he saw it, this store required his presence at
night as late as twelve o'clock, with certain hours off during the
day to compensate for this. And this took him out of his home at
night&mdash;out of the ten-o'clock-boy class at last. They could
not ask him to attend any meetings save on Sunday, and not even
then, since he was supposed to work Sunday afternoons and
evenings.</p>

<p>Next, the clerk who manipulated this particular soda fountain,
quite regularly received passes from the manager of the theater
next door, and into the lobby of which one door to the drug store
gave&mdash;a most fascinating connection to Clyde. It seemed so
interesting to be working for a drug store thus intimately
connected with a theater.</p>

<p>And best of all, as Clyde now found to his pleasure, and yet
despair at times, the place was visited, just before and after the
show on matinee days, by bevies of girls, single and en suite, who
sat at the counter and giggled and chattered and gave their hair
and their complexions last perfecting touches before the mirror.
And Clyde, callow and inexperienced in the ways of the world, and
those of the opposite sex, was never weary of observing the beauty,
the daring, the self-sufficiency and the sweetness of these, as he
saw them. For the first time in his life, while he busied himself
with washing glasses, filling the ice-cream and syrup containers,
arranging the lemons and oranges in the trays, he had an almost
uninterrupted opportunity of studying these girls at close range.
The wonder of them! For the most part, they were so well-dressed
and smart-looking&mdash;the rings, pins, furs, delightful hats,
pretty shoes they wore. And so often he overheard them discussing
such interesting things&mdash;parties, dances, dinners, the shows
they had seen, the places in or near Kansas City to which they were
soon going, the difference between the styles of this year and
last, the fascination of certain actors and
actresses&mdash;principally actors&mdash; who were now playing or
soon coming to the city. And to this day, in his own home he had
heard nothing of all this.</p>

<p>And very often one or another of these young beauties was
accompanied by some male in evening suit, dress shirt, high hat,
bow tie, white kid gloves and patent leather shoes, a costume which
at that time Clyde felt to be the last word in all true
distinction, beauty, gallantry and bliss. To be able to wear such a
suit with such ease and air! To be able to talk to a girl after the
manner and with the sang-froid of some of these gallants! what a
true measure of achievement! No good-looking girl, as it then
appeared to him, would have anything to do with him if he did not
possess this standard of equipment. It was plainly
necessary&mdash;the thing. And once he did attain it&mdash;was able
to wear such clothes as these&mdash; well, then was he not well set
upon the path that leads to all the blisses? All the joys of life
would then most certainly be spread before him. The friendly
smiles! The secret handclasps, maybe&mdash;an arm about the waist
of some one or another&mdash;a kiss&mdash;a promise of
marriage&mdash;and then, and then!</p>

<p>And all this as a revealing flash after all the years of walking
through the streets with his father and mother to public prayer
meeting, the sitting in chapel and listening to queer and
nondescript individuals&mdash;depressing and disconcerting
people&mdash; telling how Christ had saved them and what God had
done for them. You bet he would get out of that now. He would work
and save his money and be somebody. Decidedly this simple and yet
idyllic compound of the commonplace had all the luster and wonder
of a spiritual transfiguration, the true mirage of the lost and
thirsting and seeking victim of the desert.</p>

<p>However, the trouble with this particular position, as time
speedily proved, was that much as it might teach him of mixing
drinks and how to eventually earn twelve dollars a week, it was no
immediate solvent for the yearnings and ambitions that were already
gnawing at his vitals. For Albert Sieberling, his immediate
superior, was determined to keep as much of his knowledge, as well
as the most pleasant parts of the tasks, to himself. And further he
was quite at one with the druggist for whom they worked in thinking
that Clyde, in addition to assisting him about the fountain, should
run such errands as the druggist desired, which kept Clyde
industriously employed for nearly all the hours he was on duty.</p>

<p>Consequently there was no immediate result to all this. Clyde
could see no way to dressing better than he did. Worse, he was
haunted by the fact that he had very little money and very few
contacts and connections&mdash;so few that, outside his own home,
he was lonely and not so very much less than lonely there. The
flight of Esta had thrown a chill over the religious work there,
and because, as yet, she had not returned&mdash;the family, as he
now heard, was thinking of breaking up here and moving, for want of
a better idea, to Denver, Colorado. But Clyde, by now, was
convinced that he did not wish to accompany them. What was the good
of it, he asked himself? There would be just another mission there,
the same as this one.</p>

<p>He had always lived at home&mdash;in the rooms at the rear of
the mission in Bickel Street, but he hated it. And since his
eleventh year, during all of which time his family had been
residing in Kansas City, he had been ashamed to bring boy friends
to or near it. For that reason he had always avoided boy friends,
and had walked and played very much alone&mdash;or with his brother
and sisters.</p>

<p>But now that he was sixteen and old enough to make his own way,
he ought to be getting out of this. And yet he was earning almost
nothing&mdash;not enough to live on, if he were alone&mdash;and he
had not as yet developed sufficient skill or courage to get
anything better.</p>

<p>Nevertheless when his parents began to talk of moving to Denver,
and suggested that he might secure work out there, never assuming
for a moment that he would not want to go he began to throw out
hints to the effect that it might he better if he did not. He liked
Kansas City. What was the use of changing? He had a job now and he
might get something better. But his parents, bethinking themselves
of Esta and the fate that had overtaken her, were not a little
dubious as to the outcome of such early adventuring on his part
alone. Once they were away, where would he live? With whom? What
sort of influence would enter his life, who would be at hand to aid
and council and guide him in the straight and narrow path, as they
had done? It was something to think about.</p>

<p>But spurred by this imminence of Denver, which now daily seemed
to be drawing nearer, and the fact that not long after this Mr.
Sieberling, owing to his too obvious gallantries in connection with
the fair sex, lost his place in the drug store, and Clyde came by a
new and bony and chill superior who did not seem to want him as an
assistant, he decided to quit&mdash;not at once, but rather to see,
on such errands as took him out of the store, if he could not find
something else. Incidentally in so doing, looking here and there,
he one day thought he would speak to the manager of the fountain
which was connected with the leading drug store in the principal
hotel of the city&mdash;the latter a great twelve-story affair,
which represented, as he saw it, the quintessence of luxury and
ease. Its windows were always so heavily curtained; the main
entrance (he had never ventured to look beyond that) was a
splendiferous combination of a glass and iron awning, coupled with
a marble corridor lined with palms. Often he had passed here,
wondering with boyish curiosity what the nature of the life of such
a place might be. Before its doors, so many taxis and automobiles
were always in waiting.</p>

<p>To-day, being driven by the necessity of doing something for
himself, he entered the drug store which occupied the principal
corner, facing 14th Street at Baltimore, and finding a girl cashier
in a small glass cage near the door, asked of her who was in charge
of the soda fountain. Interested by his tentative and uncertain
manner, as well as his deep and rather appealing eyes, and
instinctively judging that he was looking for something to do, she
observed: "Why, Mr. Secor, there, the manager of the store." She
nodded in the direction of a short, meticulously dressed man of
about thirty-five, who was arranging an especial display of toilet
novelties on the top of a glass case. Clyde approached him, and
being still very dubious as to how one went about getting anything
in life, and finding him engrossed in what he was doing, stood
first on one foot and then on the other, until at last, sensing
some one was hovering about for something, the man turned: "Well?"
he queried.</p>

<p>"You don't happen to need a soda fountain helper, do you?" Clyde
cast at him a glance that said as plain as anything could, "If you
have any such place, I wish you would please give it to me. I need
it."</p>

<p>"No, no, no," replied this individual, who was blond and
vigorous and by nature a little irritable and contentious. He was
about to turn away, but seeing a flicker of disappointment and
depression pass over Clyde's face, he turned and added, "Ever work
in a place like this before?"</p>

<p>"No place as fine as this. No, sir," replied Clyde, rather
fancifully moved by all that was about him. "I'm working now down
at Mr. Klinkle's store at 7th and Brooklyn, but it isn't anything
like this one and I'd like to get something better if I could."</p>

<p>"Uh," went on his interviewer, rather pleased by the innocent
tribute to the superiority of his store. "Well, that's reasonable
enough. But there isn't anything here right now that I could offer
you. We don't make many changes. But if you'd like to be a
bell-boy, I can tell you where you might get a place. They're
looking for an extra boy in the hotel inside there right now. The
captain of the boys was telling me he was in need of one. I should
think that would be as good as helping about a soda fountain, any
day."</p>

<p>Then seeing Clyde's face suddenly brighten, he added: "But you
mustn't say that I sent you, because I don't know you. Just ask for
Mr. Squires inside there, under the stairs, and he can tell you all
about it."</p>

<p>At the mere mention of work in connection with so imposing an
institution as the Green-Davidson, and the possibility of his
getting it, Clyde first stared, felt himself tremble the least bit
with excitement, then thanking his advisor for his kindness, went
direct to a green-marbled doorway which opened from the rear of
this drug-store into the lobby of the hotel. Once through it, he
beheld a lobby, the like of which, for all his years but because of
the timorous poverty that had restrained him from exploring such a
world, was more arresting, quite, than anything he had seen before.
It was all so lavish. Under his feet was a checkered
black-and-white marble floor. Above him a coppered and stained and
gilded ceiling. And supporting this, a veritable forest of black
marble columns as highly polished as the floor&mdash;glassy smooth.
And between the columns which ranged away toward three separate
entrances, one right, one left and one directly forward toward
Dalrymple Avenue&mdash;were lamps, statuary, rugs, palms, chairs,
divans, tete-a-tetes&mdash;a prodigal display. In short it was
compact, of all that gauche luxury of appointment which, as some
one once sarcastically remarked, was intended to supply
"exclusiveness to the masses." Indeed, for an essential hotel in a
great and successful American commercial city, it was almost too
luxurious. Its rooms and hall and lobbies and restaurants were
entirely too richly furnished, without the saving grace of either
simplicity or necessity.</p>

<p>As Clyde stood, gazing about the lobby, he saw a large company
of people&mdash;some women and children, but principally men as he
could see&mdash;either walking or standing about and talking or
idling in the chairs, side by side or alone. And in heavily draped
and richly furnished alcoves where were writing-tables, newspaper
files, a telegraph office, a haberdasher's shop, and a florist's
stand, were other groups. There was a convention of dentists in the
city, not a few of whom, with their wives and children, were
gathered here; but to Clyde, who was not aware of this nor of the
methods and meanings of conventions, this was the ordinary,
everyday appearance of this hotel.</p>

<p>He gazed about in awe and amazement, then remembering the name
of Squires, he began to look for him in his office "under the
stairs." To his right was a grand double-winged black-and-white
staircase which swung in two separate flights and with wide,
generous curves from the main floor to the one above. And between
these great flights was evidently the office of the hotel, for
there were many clerks there. But behind the nearest flight, and
close to the wall through which he had come, was a tall desk, at
which stood a young man of about his own age in a maroon uniform
bright with many brass buttons. And on his head was a small, round,
pill-box cap, which was cocked jauntily over one ear. He was busy
making entries with a lead pencil in a book which lay open before
him. Various other boys about his own age, and uniformed as he was,
were seated upon a long bench near him, or were to be seen darting
here and there, sometimes, returning to this one with a slip of
paper or a key or note of some kind, and then seating themselves
upon the bench to await another call apparently, which seemed to
come swiftly enough. A telephone upon the small desk at which stood
the uniformed youth was almost constantly buzzing, and after
ascertaining what was wanted, this youth struck a small bell before
him, or called "front," to which the first boy on the bench,
responded. Once called, they went hurrying up one or the other
stairs or toward one of the several entrances or elevators, and
almost invariably were to be seen escorting individuals whose bags
and suitcases and overcoats and golf sticks they carried. There
were others who disappeared and returned, carrying drinks on trays
or some package or other, which they were taking to one of the
rooms above. Plainly this was the work that he should be called
upon to do, assuming that he would be so fortunate as to connect
himself with such an institution as this.</p>

<p>And it was all so brisk and enlivening that he wished that he
might be so fortunate as to secure a position here. But would he
be? And where was Mr. Squires? He approached the youth at the small
desk: "Do you know where I will find Mr. Squires?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Here he comes now," replied the youth, looking up and examining
Clyde with keen, gray eyes.</p>

<p>Clyde gazed in the direction indicated, and saw approaching a
brisk and dapper and decidedly sophisticated-looking person of
perhaps twenty-nine or thirty years of age. He was so very slender,
keen, hatchet-faced and well-dressed that Clyde was not only
impressed but overawed at once&mdash;a very shrewd and
cunning-looking person. His nose was so long and thin, his eyes so
sharp, his lips thin, and chin pointed.</p>

<p>"Did you see that tall, gray-haired man with the Scotch plaid
shawl who went through here just now?" he paused to say to his
assistant at the desk. The assistant nodded. "Well, they tell me
that's the Earl of Landreil. He just came in this morning with
fourteen trunks and four servants. Can you beat it! He's somebody
in Scotland. That isn't the name he travels under, though, I hear.
He's registered as Mr. Blunt. Can you beat that English stuff? They
can certainly lay on the class, eh?"</p>

<p>"You said it!" replied his assistant deferentially.</p>

<p>He turned for the first time, glimpsing Clyde, but paying no
attention to him. His assistant came to Clyde's aid.</p>

<p>"That young fella there is waiting to see you," he
explained.</p>

<p>"You want to see me?" queried the captain of the bellhops,
turning to Clyde, and observing his none-too-good clothes, at the
same time making a comprehensive study of him.</p>

<p>"The gentleman in the drug store," began Clyde, who did not
quite like the looks of the man before him, but was determined to
present himself as agreeably as possible, "was saying&mdash;that
is, he said that I might ask you if there was any chance here for
me as a bell-boy. I'm working now at Klinkle's drug store at 7th
and Brooklyn, as a helper, but I'd like to get out of that and he
said you might&mdash; that is&mdash;he thought you had a place open
now." Clyde was so flustered and disturbed by the cool, examining
eyes of the man before him that he could scarcely get his breath
properly, and swallowed hard.</p>

<p>For the first time in his life, it occurred to him that if he
wanted to get on he ought to insinuate himself into the good graces
of people&mdash;do or say something that would make them like him.
So now he contrived an eager, ingratiating smile, which he bestowed
on Mr. Squires, and added: "If you'd like to give me a chance, I'd
try very hard and I'd be very willing."</p>

<p>The man before him merely looked at him coldly, but being the
soul of craft and self-acquisitiveness in a petty way, and rather
liking anybody who had the skill and the will to be diplomatic, he
now put aside an impulse to shake his head negatively, and
observed: "But you haven't had any training in this work."</p>

<p>"No, sir, but couldn't I pick it up pretty quick if I tried
hard?"</p>

<p>"Well, let me see," observed the head of the bell-hops,
scratching his head dubiously. "I haven't any time to talk to you
now. Come around Monday afternoon. I'll see you then." He turned on
his heel and walked away.</p>

<p>Clyde, left alone in this fashion, and not knowing just what it
meant, stared, wondering. Was it really true that he had been
invited to come back on Monday? Could it be possible that&mdash;He
turned and hurried out, thrilling from head to toe. The idea! He
had asked this man for a place in the very finest hotel in Kansas
City and he had asked him to come back and see him on Monday. Gee!
what would that mean? Could it be possible that he would be
admitted to such a grand world as this&mdash;and that so speedily?
Could it really be?</p>

<h3>Chapter 5</h3>

<p>The imaginative flights of Clyde in connection with all
this&mdash;his dreams of what it might mean for him to be connected
with so glorious an institution&mdash;can only be suggested. For
his ideas of luxury were in the main so extreme and mistaken and
gauche&mdash;mere wanderings of a repressed and unsatisfied fancy,
which as yet had had nothing but imaginings to feed it.</p>

<p>He went back to his old duties at the drug-store&mdash;to his
home after hours in order to eat and sleep&mdash;but now for the
balance of this Friday and Saturday and Sunday and Monday until
late in the day, he walked on air, really. His mind was not on what
he was doing, and several times his superior at the drugstore had
to remind him to "wake-up." And after hours, instead of going
directly home, he walked north to the corner of 14th and Baltimore,
where stood this great hotel, and looked at it. There, at midnight
even, before each of the three principal entrances&mdash;one facing
each of three streets&mdash;was a doorman in a long maroon coat
with many buttons and a high-rimmed and long-visored maroon cap.
And inside, behind looped and fluted French silk curtains, were the
still blazing lights, the a la carte dining-room and the American
grill in the basement near one corner still open. And about them
were many taxis and cars. And there was music always&mdash;from
somewhere.</p>

<p>After surveying it all this Friday night and again on Saturday
and Sunday morning, he returned on Monday afternoon at the
suggestion of Mr. Squires and was greeted by that individual rather
crustily, for by then he had all but forgotten him. But seeing that
at the moment he was actually in need of help, and being satisfied
that Clyde might be of service, he led him into his small office
under the stair, where, with a very superior manner and much actual
indifference, he proceeded to question him as to his parentage,
where he lived, at what he had worked before and where, what his
father did for a living&mdash;a poser that for Clyde, for he was
proud and so ashamed to admit that his parents conducted a mission
and preached on the streets. Instead he replied (which was true at
times) that his father canvassed for a washing machine and wringer
company&mdash;and on Sundays preached&mdash;a religious revelation,
which was not at all displeasing to this master of boys who were
inclined to be anything but home-loving and conservative. Could he
bring a reference from where he now was? He could.</p>

<p>Mr. Squires proceeded to explain that this hotel was very
strict. Too many boys, on account of the scenes and the show here,
the contact made with undue luxury to which they were not
accustomed&mdash; though these were not the words used by Mr.
Squires&mdash;were inclined to lose their heads and go wrong. He
was constantly being forced to discharge boys who, because they
made a little extra money, didn't know how to conduct themselves.
He must have boys who were willing, civil, prompt, courteous to
everybody. They must be clean and neat about their persons and
clothes and show up promptly&mdash;on the dot&mdash;and in good
condition for the work every day. And any boy who got to thinking
that because he made a little money he could flirt with anybody or
talk back, or go off on parties at night, and then not show up on
time or too tired to be quick and bright, needn't think that he
would be here long. He would be fired, and that promptly. He would
not tolerate any nonsense. That must be understood now, once and
for all.</p>

<p>Clyde nodded assent often and interpolated a few eager "yes,
sirs" and "no, sirs," and assured him at the last that it was the
furtherest thing from his thoughts and temperament to dream of any
such high crimes and misdemeanors as he had outlined. Mr. Squires
then proceeded to explain that this hotel only paid fifteen dollars
a month and board&mdash;at the servant's table in the
basement&mdash;to any bell-boy at any time. But, and this
information came as a most amazing revelation to Clyde, every guest
for whom any of these boys did anything&mdash;carried a bag or
delivered a pitcher of water or did anything&mdash;gave him a tip,
and often quite a liberal one&mdash;a dime, fifteen cents, a
quarter, sometimes more. And these tips, as Mr. Squires explained,
taken all together, averaged from four to six dollars a
day&mdash;not less and sometimes more&mdash;most amazing pay, as
Clyde now realized. His heart gave an enormous bound and was near
to suffocating him at the mere mention of so large a sum. From four
to six dollars! Why, that was twenty-eight to forty-two dollars a
week! He could scarcely believe it. And that in addition to the
fifteen dollars a month and board. And there was no charge, as Mr.
Squires now explained, for the handsome uniforms the boys wore. But
it might not be worn or taken out of the place. His hours, as Mr.
Squires now proceeded to explain, would be as follows: On Mondays,
Wednesdays, Fridays and Sundays, he was to work from six in the
morning until noon, and then, with six hours off, from six in the
evening until midnight. On Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays, he
need only work from noon until six, thus giving him each alternate
afternoon or evening to himself. But all his meals were to be taken
outside his working hours and he was to report promptly in uniform
for line-up and inspection by his superior exactly ten minutes
before the regular hours of his work began at each watch.</p>

<p>As for some other things which were in his mind at the time, Mr.
Squires said nothing. There were others, as he knew, who would
speak for him. Instead he went on to add, and then quite
climactically for Clyde at that time, who had been sitting as one
in a daze: "I suppose you are ready to go to work now, aren't
you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, yes, sir," he replied.</p>

<p>"Very good!" Then he got up and opened the door which had shut
them in. "Oscar," he called to a boy seated at the head of the
bell-boy bench, to which a tallish, rather oversized youth in a
tight, neat-looking uniform responded with alacrity. "Take this
young man here&mdash;Clyde Griffiths is your name, isn't
it?&mdash;up to the wardrobe on the twelfth and see if Jacobs can
find a suit to fit. But if he can't tell him to alter it by
to-morrow. I think the one Silsbee wore ought to be about right for
him."</p>

<p>Then he turned to his assistant at the desk who was at the
moment looking on. "I'm giving him a trial, anyhow," he commented.
"Have one of the boys coach him a little to-night or whenever he
starts in. Go ahead, Oscar," he called to the boy in charge of
Clyde. "He's green at this stuff, but I think he'll do," he added
to his assistant, as Clyde and Oscar disappeared in the direction
of one of the elevators. Then he walked off to have Clyde's name
entered upon the payroll.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Clyde, in tow of this new mentor, was listening
to a line of information such as never previously had come to his
ears anywhere.</p>

<p>"You needn't be frightened, if you ain't never worked at
anything like dis before," began this youth, whose last name was
Hegglund as Clyde later learned, and who hailed from Jersey City,
New Jersey, exotic lingo, gestures and all. He was tall, vigorous,
sandy-haired, freckled, genial and voluble. They had entered upon
an elevator labeled 'employees.' "It ain't so hard. I got my first
job in Buffalo t'ree years ago and I never knowed a t'ing about it
up to dat time. All you gotta do is to watch de udders an' see how
dey do, see. Yu get dat, do you?"</p>

<p>Clyde, whose education was not a little superior to that of his
guide, commented quite sharply in his own mind on the use of such
words as "knowed," and "gotta"&mdash;also upon "t'ing," "dat,"
"udders," and so on, but so grateful was he for any courtesy at
this time that he was inclined to forgive his obviously kindly
mentor anything for his geniality.</p>

<p>"Watch whoever's doin' anyt'ing, at first, see, till you git to
know, see. Dat's de way. When de bell rings, if you're at de head
of de bench, it's your turn, see, an' you jump up and go quick. Dey
like you to be quick around here, see. An' whenever you see any one
come in de door or out of an elevator wit a bag, an' you're at de
head of de bench, you jump, wedder de captain rings de bell or
calls 'front' or not. Sometimes he's busy or ain't lookin' an' he
wants you to do dat, see. Look sharp, cause if you don't get no
bags, you don't get no tips, see. Everybody dat has a bag or
anyt'ing has to have it carried for 'em, unless dey won't let you
have it, see.</p>

<p>"But be sure and wait somewhere near de desk for whoever comes
in until dey sign up for a room," he rattled on as they ascended in
the elevator. "Most every one takes a room. Den de clerk'll give
you de key an' after dat all you gotta do is to carry up de bags to
de room. Den all you gotta do is to turn on de lights in de batroom
and closet, if dere is one, so dey'll know where dey are, see. An'
den raise de curtains in de day time or lower 'em at night, an' see
if dere's towels in de room, so you can tell de maid if dere ain't,
and den if dey don't give you no tip, you gotta go, only most
times, unless you draw a stiff, all you gotta do is hang back a
little&mdash;make a stall, see&mdash;fumble wit de door-key or try
de transom, see. Den, if dey're any good, dey'll hand you a tip. If
dey don't, you're out, dat's all, see. You can't even look as dough
you was sore, dough&mdash;nottin' like dat, see. Den you come down
an' unless dey wants ice-water or somepin, you're troo, see. It's
back to de bench, quick. Dere ain't much to it. Only you gotta be
quick all de time, see, and not let any one get by you comin' or
goin'&mdash;dat's de main t'ing.</p>

<p>"An' after dey give you your uniform, an' you go to work, don't
forgit to give de captain a dollar after every watch before you
leave, see&mdash;two dollars on de day you has two watches, and a
dollar on de day you has one, see? Dat's de way it is here. We work
togedder like dat, an' you gotta do dat if you wanta hold your job.
But dat's all. After dat all de rest is yours."</p>

<p>Clyde saw.</p>

<p>A part of his twenty-four or thirty-two dollars as he figured it
was going glimmering, apparently&mdash;eleven or twelve all
told&mdash;but what of it! Would there not be twelve or fifteen or
even more left? And there were his meals and his uniform. Kind
Heaven! What a realization of paradise! What a consummation of
luxury!</p>

<p>Mr. Hegglund of Jersey City escorted him to the twelfth floor
and into a room where they found on guard a wizened and grizzled
little old man of doubtful age and temperament, who forthwith
ouffitted Clyde with a suit that was so near a fit that, without
further orders, it was not deemed necessary to alter it. And trying
on various caps, there was one that fitted him&mdash;a thing that
sat most rakishly over one ear&mdash;only, as Hegglund informed
him, "You'll have to get dat hair of yours cut. Better get it
clipped behind. It's too long." And with that Clyde himself had
been in mental agreement before he spoke. His hair certainly did
not look right in the new cap. He hated it now. And going
downstairs, and reporting to Mr. Whipple, Mr. Squires' assistant,
the latter had said: "Very well. It fits all right, does it? Well,
then, you go on here at six. Report at five-thirty and be here in
your uniform at five-forty-five for inspection."</p>

<p>Whereupon Clyde, being advised by Hegglund to go then and there
to get his uniform and take it to the dressing-room in the
basement, and get his locker from the locker-man, he did so, and
then hurried most nervously out&mdash;first to get a hair-cut and
afterwards to report to his family on his great luck.</p>

<p>He was to be a bell-boy in the great Hotel Green-Davidson. He
was to wear a uniform and a handsome one. He was to make&mdash;but
he did not tell his mother at first what he was to make,
truly&mdash;but more than eleven or twelve at first, anyhow, he
guessed&mdash;he could not be sure. For now, all at once, he saw
economic independence ahead for himself, if not for his family, and
he did not care to complicate it with any claims which a confession
as to his real salary would most certainly inspire. But he did say
that he was to have his meals free&mdash;because that meant eating
away from home, which was what he wished. And in addition he was to
live and move always in the glorious atmosphere of this
hotel&mdash;not to have to go home ever before twelve, if he did
not wish&mdash;to have good clothes&mdash; interesting company,
maybe&mdash;a good time, gee!</p>

<p>And as he hurried on about his various errands now, it occurred
to him as a final and shrewd and delicious thought that he need not
go home on such nights as he wished to go to a theater or anything
like that. He could just stay down-town and say he had to work. And
that with free meals and good clothes&mdash;think of that!</p>

<p>The mere thought of all this was so astonishing and entrancing
that he could not bring himself to think of it too much. He must
wait and see. He must wait and see just how much he would make here
in this perfectly marvelous-marvelous realm.</p>

<h3>Chapter 6</h3>

<p>And as conditions stood, the extraordinary economic and social
inexperience of the Griffiths&mdash;Asa and Elvira&mdash;dovetailed
all too neatly with his dreams. For neither Asa nor Elvira had the
least knowledge of the actual character of the work upon which he
was about to enter, scarcely any more than he did, or what it might
mean to him morally, imaginatively, financially, or in any other
way. For neither of them had ever stopped in a hotel above the
fourth class in all their days. Neither one had ever eaten in a
restaurant of a class that catered to other than individuals of
their own low financial level. That there could be any other forms
of work or contact than those involved in carrying the bags of
guests to and from the door of a hotel to its office, and back
again, for a boy of Clyde's years and temperament, never occurred
to them. And it was naively assumed by both that the pay for such
work must of necessity be very small anywhere, say five or six
dollars a week, and so actually below Clyde's deserts and his
years.</p>

<p>And in view of this, Mrs. Griffiths, who was more practical than
her husband at all times, and who was intensely interested in
Clyde's economic welfare, as well as that of her other children,
was actually wondering why Clyde should of a sudden become so
enthusiastic about changing to this new situation, which, according
to his own story, involved longer hours and not so very much more
pay, if any. To be sure, he had already suggested that it might
lead to some superior position in the hotel, some clerkship or
other, but he did not know when that would be, and the other had
promised rather definite fulfillment somewhat earlier&mdash;as to
money, anyhow.</p>

<p>But seeing him rush in on Monday afternoon and announce that he
had secured the place and that forthwith he must change his tie and
collar and get his hair cut and go back and report, she felt better
about it. For never before had she seen him so enthusiastic about
anything, and it was something to have him more content with
himself&mdash;not so moody, as he was at times.</p>

<p>Yet, the hours which he began to maintain now&mdash;from six in
the morning until midnight&mdash;with only an occasional early
return on such evenings as he chose to come home when he was not
working&mdash;and when he troubled to explain that he had been let
off a little early&mdash;together with a certain eager and restless
manner&mdash;a desire to be out and away from his home at nearly
all such moments as he was not in bed or dressing or undressing,
puzzled his mother and Asa, also. The hotel! The hotel! He must
always hurry off to the hotel, and all that he had to report was
that he liked it ever so much, and that he was doing all right, he
thought. It was nicer work than working around a soda fountain, and
he might be making more money pretty soon&mdash;he couldn't
tell&mdash;but as for more than that he either wouldn't or couldn't
say.</p>

<p>And all the time the Griffiths&mdash;father and
mother&mdash;were feeling that because of the affair in connection
with Esta, they should really be moving away from Kansas
City&mdash;should go to Denver. And now more than ever, Clyde was
insisting that he did not want to leave Kansas City. They might go,
but he had a pretty good job now and wanted to stick to it. And if
they left, he could get a room somewhere&mdash;and would be all
right&mdash;a thought which did not appeal to them at all.</p>

<p>But in the meantime what an enormous change in Clyde's life.
Beginning with that first evening, when at 5:45, he appeared before
Mr. Whipple, his immediate superior, and was approved&mdash;not
only because of the fit of his new uniform, but for his general
appearance&mdash;the world for him had changed entirely. Lined up
with seven others in the servants' hall, immediately behind the
general offices in the lobby, and inspected by Mr. Whipple, the
squad of eight marched at the stroke of six through a door that
gave into the lobby on the other side of the staircase from where
stood Mr. Whipple's desk, then about and in front of the general
registration office to the long bench on the other side. A Mr.
Barnes, who alternated with Mr. Whipple, then took charge of the
assistant captain's desk, and the boys seated
themselves&mdash;Clyde at the foot&mdash; only to be called swiftly
and in turn to perform this, that and the other service&mdash;while
the relieved squad of Mr. Whipple was led away into the rear
servants' hall as before, where they disbanded.</p>

<p>"Cling!"</p>

<p>The bell on the room clerk's desk had sounded and the first boy
was going.</p>

<p>"Cling!" It sounded again and a second boy leaped to his
feet.</p>

<p>"Front!"&mdash;"Center door!" called Mr. Barnes, and a third boy
was skidding down the long marble floor toward that entrance to
seize the bags of an incoming guest, whose white whiskers and
youthful, bright tweed suit were visible to Clyde's uninitiated
eyes a hundred feet away. A mysterious and yet sacred
vision&mdash;a tip!</p>

<p>"Front!" It was Mr. Barnes calling again. "See what 913
wants&mdash; ice-water, I guess." And a fourth boy was gone.</p>

<p>Clyde, steadily moving up along the bench and adjoining
Hegglund, who had been detailed to instruct him a little, was all
eyes and ears and nerves. He was so tense that he could hardly
breathe, and fidgeted and jerked until finally Hegglund exclaimed:
"Now, don't get excited. Just hold your horses will yuh? You'll be
all right. You're jist like I was when I begun&mdash;all noives.
But dat ain't de way. Easy's what you gotta be aroun' here. An' you
wants to look as dough you wasn't seein' nobody nowhere&mdash;just
lookin' to what ya got before ya."</p>

<p>"Front!" Mr. Barnes again. Clyde was scarcely able to keep his
mind on what Hegglund was saying. "115 wants some writing paper and
pens." A fifth boy had gone.</p>

<p>"Where do you get writing paper and pens if they want 'em?" He
pleaded of his imtructor, as one who was about to die might
plead.</p>

<p>"Off'n de key desk, I toldja. He's to de left over dere. He'll
give 'em to ya. An' you gits ice-water in de hall we lined up in
just a minute ago&mdash;at dat end over dere, see&mdash;you'll see
a little door. You gotta give dat guy in dere a dime oncet in a
while or he'll get sore."</p>

<p>"Cling!" The room clerk's bell. A sixth boy had gone without a
word to supply some order in that direction.</p>

<p>"And now remember," continued Hegglund, seeing that he himself
was next, and cautioning him for the last time, "if dey wants
drinks of any kind, you get 'em in de grill over dere off'n de
dining-room. An' be sure and git de names of de drinks straight or
dey'll git sore. An' if it's a room you're showing, pull de shades
down to-night and turn on de lights. An' if it's anyt'ing from de
dinin'-room you gotta see de headwaiter&mdash;he gets de tip,
see."</p>

<p>"Front!" He was up and gone.</p>

<p>And Clyde was number one. And number four was already seating
himself again by his side&mdash;but looking shrewdly around to see
if anybody was wanted anywhere.</p>

<p>"Front!" It was Mr. Barnes. Clyde was up and before him,
grateful that it was no one coming in with bags, but worried for
fear it might be something that he would not understand or could
not do quickly.</p>

<p>"See what 882 wants." Clyde was off toward one of the two
elevators marked, "employees," the proper one to use, he thought,
because he had been taken to the twelfth floor that way, but
another boy stepping out from one of the fast passenger elevators
cautioned him as to his mistake.</p>

<p>"Goin' to a room?" he called. "Use the guest elevators. Them's
for the servants or anybody with bundles."</p>

<p>Clyde hastened to cover his mistake. "Eight," he called. There
being no one else on the elevator with them, the Negro elevator boy
in charge of the car saluted him at once.</p>

<p>"You'se new, ain't you? I ain't seen you around her befo'."</p>

<p>"Yes, I just came on," replied Clyde.</p>

<p>"Well, you won't hate it here," commented this youth in the most
friendly way. "No one hates this house, I'll say. Eight did you
say?" He stopped the car and Clyde stepped out. He was too nervous
to think to ask the direction and now began looking at room
numbers, only to decide after a moment that he was in the wrong
corridor. The soft brown carpet under his feet; the soft,
cream-tinted walls; the snow-white bowl lights in the
ceiling&mdash;all seemed to him parts of a perfection and a social
superiority which was almost unbelievable&mdash;so remote from all
that he had ever known.</p>

<p>And finally, finding 882, he knocked timidly and was greeted
after a moment by a segment of a very stout and vigorous body in a
blue and white striped union suit and a related segment of a round
and florid head in which was set one eye and some wrinkles to one
side of it.</p>

<p>"Here's a dollar bill, son," said the eye seemingly&mdash;and
now a hand appeared holding a paper dollar. It was fat and red.
"You go out to a haberdasher's and get me a pair of
garters&mdash;Boston Garters&mdash; silk&mdash;and hurry back."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied Clyde, and took the dollar. The door closed
and he found himself hustling along the hall toward the elevator,
wondering what a haberdasher's was. As old as he
was&mdash;seventeen&mdash; the name was new to him. He had never
even heard it before, or noticed it at least. If the man had said a
"gents' furnishing store," he would have understood at once, but
now here he was told to go to a haberdasher's and he did not know
what it was. A cold sweat burst out upon his forehead. His knees
trembled. The devil! What would he do now? Could he ask any one,
even Hegglund, and not seem&mdash;</p>

<p>He pushed the elevator button. The car began to descend. A
haberdasher. A haberdasher. Suddenly a sane thought reached him.
Supposing he didn't know what a haberdasher was? After all the man
wanted a pair of silk Boston garters. Where did one get silk Boston
garters&mdash;at a store, of course, a place where they sold things
for men. Certainly. A gents' furnishing store. He would run out to
a store. And on the way down, noting another friendly Negro in
charge, he asked: "Do you know if there's a gents' furnishing store
anywhere around here?"</p>

<p>"One in the building, captain, right outside the south lobby,"
replied the Negro, and Clyde hurried there, greatly relieved. Yet
he felt odd and strange in his close-fitting uniform and his
peculiar hat. All the time he was troubled by the notion that his
small, round, tight-fitting hat might fall off. And he kept
pressing it furtively and yet firmly down. And bustling into the
haberdasher's, which was blazing with lights outside, he exclaimed,
"I want to get a pair of Boston silk garters."</p>

<p>"All right, son, here you are," replied a sleek, short man with
bright, bald head, pink face and gold-rimmed glasses. "For some one
in the hotel, I presume? Well, we'll make that seventy-five cents,
and here's a dime for you," he remarked as he wrapped up the
package and dropped the dollar in the cash register. "I always like
to do the right thing by you boys in there because I know you come
to me whenever you can."</p>

<p>Clyde took the dime and the package, not knowing quite what to
think. The garters must be seventy-five cents&mdash;he said so.
Hence only twenty-five cents need to be returned to the man. Then
the dime was his. And now, maybe&mdash;would the man really give
him another tip?</p>

<p>He hurried back into the hotel and up to the elevators. The
strains of a string orchestra somewhere were filling the lobby with
delightful sounds. People were moving here and there&mdash;so
well-dressed, so much at ease, so very different from most of the
people in the streets or anywhere, as he saw it.</p>

<p>An elevator door flew open. Various guests entered. Then Clyde
and another bell-boy who gave him an interested glance. At the
sixth floor the boy departed. At the eighth Clyde and an old lady
stepped forth. He hurried to the door of his guest and tapped. The
man opened it, somewhat more fully dressed than before. He had on a
pair of trousers and was shaving.</p>

<p>"Back, eh," he called.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied Clyde, handing him the package and change.
"He said it was seventy-five cents."</p>

<p>"He's a damned robber, but you can keep the change, just the
same," he replied, handing him the quarter and closing the door.
Clyde stood there, quite spellbound for the fraction of a second.
"Thirty-five cents"&mdash;he thought&mdash;"thirty-five cents." And
for one little short errand. Could that really be the way things
went here? It couldn't be, really. It wasn't possible&mdash;not
always.</p>

<p>And then, his feet sinking in the soft nap of the carpet, his
hand in one pocket clutching the money, he felt as if he could
squeal or laugh out loud. Why, thirty-five cents&mdash;and for a
little service like that. This man had given him a quarter and the
other a dime and he hadn't done anything at all.</p>

<p>He hurried from the car at the bottom&mdash;the strains of the
orchestra once more fascinated him, the wonder of so well-dressed a
throng thrilling him&mdash;and made his way to the bench from which
he had first departed.</p>

<p>And following this he had been called to carry the three bags
and two umbrellas of an aged farmer-like couple, who had engaged a
parlor, bedroom and bath on the fifth floor. En route they kept
looking at him, as he could see, but said nothing. Yet once in
their room, and after he had promptly turned on the lights near the
door, lowered the blinds and placed the bags upon the bag racks,
the middle-aged and rather awkward husband&mdash;a decidedly solemn
and bewhiskered person&mdash;studied him and finally observed:
"Young fella, you seem to be a nice, brisk sort of boy&mdash;rather
better than most we've seen so far, I must say."</p>

<p>"I certainly don't think that hotels are any place for boys,"
chirped up the wife of his bosom&mdash;a large and rotund person,
who by this time was busily employed inspecting an adjoining room.
"I certainly wouldn't want any of my boys to work in 'em&mdash;the
way people act."</p>

<p>"But here, young man," went on the elder, laying off his
overcoat and fishing in his trousers pocket. "You go down and get
me three or four evening papers if there are that many and a
pitcher of ice-water, and I'll give you fifteen cents when you get
back."</p>

<p>"This hotel's better'n the one in Omaha, Pa," added the wife
sententiously. "It's got nicer carpets and curtains."</p>

<p>And as green as Clyde was, he could not help smiling secretly.
Openly, however, he preserved a masklike solemnity, seemingly
effacing all facial evidence of thought, and took the change and
went out. And in a few moments he was back with the ice-water and
all the evening papers and departed smilingly with his fifteen
cents.</p>

<p>But this, in itself, was but a beginning in so far as this
particular evening was concerned, for he was scarcely seated upon
the bench again, before he was called to room 529, only to be sent
to the bar for drinks&mdash;two ginger ales and two syphons of
soda&mdash;and this by a group of smartly-dressed young men and
girls who were laughing and chattering in the room, one of whom
opened the door just wide enough to instruct him as to what was
wanted. But because of a mirror over the mantel, he could see the
party and one pretty girl in a white suit and cap, sitting on the
edge of a chair in which reclined a young man who had his arm about
her.</p>

<p>Clyde stared, even while pretending not to. And in his state of
mind, this sight was like looking through the gates of Paradise.
Here were young fellows and girls in this room, not so much older
than himself, laughing and talking and drinking even&mdash;not
ice-cream sodas and the like, but such drinks no doubt as his
mother and father were always speaking against as leading to
destruction, and apparently nothing was thought of it.</p>

<p>He bustled down to the bar, and having secured the drinks and a
charge slip, returned&mdash;and was paid&mdash;a dollar and a half
for the drinks and a quarter for himself. And once more he had a
glimpse of the appealing scene. Only now one of the couples was
dancing to a tune sung and whistled by the other two.</p>

<p>But what interested him as much as the visits to and glimpses of
individuals in the different rooms, was the moving panorama of the
main lobby&mdash;the character of the clerks behind the main
desk&mdash;room clerk, key clerk, mail clerk, cashier and assistant
cashier. And the various stands about the place&mdash;flower stand,
news stand, cigar stand, telegraph office, taxicab office, and all
manned by individuals who seemed to him curiously filled with the
atmosphere of this place. And then around and between all these
walking or sitting were such imposing men and women, young men and
girls all so fashionably dressed, all so ruddy and contented
looking. And the cars or other vehicles in which some of them
appeared about dinner time and later. It was possible for him to
see them in the flare of the lights outside. The wraps, furs, and
other belongings in which they appeared, or which were often
carried by these other boys and himself across the great lobby and
into the cars or the dining-room or the several elevators. And they
were always of such gorgeous textures, as Clyde saw them. Such
grandeur. This, then, most certainly was what it meant to be rich,
to be a person of consequence in the world&mdash;to have money. It
meant that you did what you pleased. That other people, like
himself, waited upon you. That you possessed all of these luxuries.
That you went how, where and when you pleased.</p>

<h3>Chapter 7</h3>

<p>And so, of all the influences which might have come to Clyde at
this time, either as an aid or an injury to his development,
perhaps the most dangerous for him, considering his temperament,
was this same Green-Davidson, than which no more materially
affected or gaudy a realm could have been found anywhere between
the two great American mountain ranges. Its darkened and cushioned
tea-room, so somber and yet tinted so gayly with colored lights,
was an ideal rendezvous, not only for such inexperienced and eager
flappers of the period who were to be taken by a show of luxury,
but also for those more experienced and perhaps a little faded
beauties, who had a thought for their complexions and the
advantages of dim and uncertain lights. Also, like most hotels of
its kind, it was frequented by a certain type of eager and
ambitious male of not certain age or station in life, who counted
upon his appearance here at least once, if not twice a day, at
certain brisk and interesting hours, to establish for himself the
reputation of man-about-town, or rounder, or man of wealth, or
taste, or attractiveness, or all.</p>

<p>And it was not long after Clyde had begun to work here that he
was informed by these peculiar boys with whom he was associated,
one or more of whom was constantly seated with him upon the
"hop-bench," as they called it, as to the evidence and presence
even here&mdash;it was not long before various examples of the
phenomena were pointed out to him&mdash;of a certain type of social
pervert, morally disarranged and socially taboo, who sought to
arrest and interest boys of their type, in order to come into some
form of illicit relationship with them, which at first Clyde could
not grasp. The mere thought of it made him ill. And yet some of
these boys, as he was now informed&mdash;a certain youth in
particular, who was not on the same watch with him at this
time&mdash;were supposed to be of the mind that "fell for it," as
one of the other youths phrased it.</p>

<p>And the talk and the palaver that went on in the lobby and the
grill, to say nothing of the restaurants and rooms, were sufficient
to convince any inexperienced and none-too-discerning mind that the
chief business of life for any one with a little money or social
position was to attend a theater, a ball-game in season, or to
dance, motor, entertain friends at dinner, or to travel to New
York, Europe, Chicago, California. And there had been in the lives
of most of these boys such a lack of anything that approached
comfort or taste, let alone luxury, that not unlike Clyde, they
were inclined to not only exaggerate the import of all that they
saw, but to see in this sudden transition an opportunity to partake
of it all. Who were these people with money, and what had they done
that they should enjoy so much luxury, where others as good
seemingly as themselves had nothing? And wherein did these latter
differ so greatly from the successful? Clyde could not see. Yet
these thoughts flashed through the minds of every one of these
boys.</p>

<p>At the same time the admiration, to say nothing of the private
overtures of a certain type of woman or girl, who inhibited perhaps
by the social milieu in which she found herself, but having means,
could invade such a region as this, and by wiles and smiles and the
money she possessed, ingratiate herself into the favor of some of
the more attractive of these young men here, was much commented
upon.</p>

<p>Thus a youth named Ratterer&mdash;a hall-boy here&mdash;sitting
beside him the very next afternoon, seeing a trim, well-formed
blonde woman of about thirty enter with a small dog upon her arm,
and much bedecked with furs, first nudged him and, with a faint
motion of the head indicating her vicinity, whispered, "See her?
There's a swift one. I'll tell you about her sometime when I have
time. Gee, the things she don't do!"</p>

<p>"What about her?" asked Clyde, keenly curious, for to him she
seemed exceedingly beautiful, most fascinating.</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing, except she's been in with about eight different
men around here since I've been here. She fell for
Doyle"&mdash;another hall-boy whom by this time Clyde had already
observed as being the quintessence of Chesterfieldian grace and
airs and looks, a youth to imitate&mdash;"for a while, but now
she's got some one else."</p>

<p>"Really?" inquired Clyde, very much astonished and wondering if
such luck would ever come to him.</p>

<p>"Surest thing you know," went on Ratterer. "She's a bird that
way&mdash; never gets enough. Her husband, they tell me, has a big
lumber business somewhere over in Kansas, but they don't live
together no more. She has one of the best suites on the sixth, but
she ain't in it half the time. The maid told me."</p>

<p>This same Ratterer, who was short and stocky but good-looking
and smiling, was so smooth and bland and generally agreeable that
Clyde was instantly drawn to him and wished to know him better. And
Ratterer reciprocated that feeling, for he had the notion that
Clyde was innocent and inexperienced and that he would like to do
some little thing for him if he could.</p>

<p>The conversation was interrupted by a service call, and never
resumed about this particular woman, but the effect on Clyde was
sharp. The woman was pleasing to look upon and exceedingly
well-groomed, her skin clear, her eyes bright. Could what Ratterer
had been telling him really be true? She was so pretty. He sat and
gazed, a vision of something which he did not care to acknowledge
even to himself tingling the roots of his hair.</p>

<p>And then the temperaments and the philosophy of these
boys&mdash; Kinsella, short and thick and smooth-faced and a little
dull, as Clyde saw it, but good-looking and virile, and reported to
be a wizard at gambling, who, throughout the first three days at
such times as other matters were not taking his attention, had been
good enough to continue Hegglund's instructions in part. He was a
more suave, better spoken youth than Hegglund, though not so
attractive as Ratterer, Clyde thought, without the latter's
sympathetic outlook, as Clyde saw it.</p>

<p>And again, there was Doyle&mdash;Eddie&mdash;whom Clyde found
intensely interesting from the first, and of whom he was not a
little jealous, because he was so very good-looking, so trim of
figure, easy and graceful of gesture, and with so soft and pleasing
a voice. He went about with an indescribable air which seemed to
ingratiate him instantly with all with whom he came in
contact&mdash;the clerks behind the counter no less than the
strangers who entered and asked this or that question of him. His
shoes and collar were so clean and trim, and his hair cut and
brushed and oiled after a fashion which would have become a
moving-picture actor. From the first Clyde was utterly fascinated
by his taste in the matter of dress&mdash;the neatest of brown
suits, caps, with ties and socks to match. He should wear a
brown-belted coat just like that. He should have a brown cap. And a
suit as well cut and attractive.</p>

<p>Similarly, a not unrelated and yet different effect was produced
by that same youth who had first introduced Clyde to the work
here&mdash; Hegglund&mdash;who was one of the older and more
experienced bell-hops, and of considerable influence with the
others because of his genial and devil-may-care attitude toward
everything, outside the exact line of his hotel duties. Hegglund
was neither as schooled nor as attractive as some of the others,
yet by reason of a most avid and dynamic disposition&mdash;plus a
liberality where money and pleasure were concerned, and a courage,
strength and daring which neither Doyle nor Ratterer nor Kinsella
could match&mdash;a strength and daring almost entirely divested of
reason at times&mdash;he interested and charmed Clyde immensely. As
he himself related to Clyde, after a time, he was the son of a
Swedish journeyman baker who some years before in Jersey City had
deserted his mother and left her to make her way as best she could.
In consequence neither Oscar nor his sister Martha had had any too
much education or decent social experience of any kind. On the
contrary, at the age of fourteen he had left Jersey City in a box
car and had been making his way ever since as best he could. And
like Clyde, also, he was insanely eager for all the pleasures which
he had imagined he saw swirling around him, and was for prosecuting
adventures in every direction, lacking, however, the nervous fear
of consequence which characterized Clyde. Also he had a friend, a
youth by the name of Sparser, somewhat older than himself, who was
chauffeur to a wealthy citizen of Kansas City, and who occasionally
managed to purloin a car and so accommodate Hegglund in the matter
of brief outings here and there; which courtesy, unconventional and
dishonest though it might be, still caused Hegglund to feel that he
was a wonderful fellow and of much more importance than some of
these others, and to lend him in their eyes a luster which had
little of the reality which it suggested to them.</p>

<p>Not being as attractive as Doyle, it was not so easy for him to
win the attention of girls, and those he did succeed in interesting
were not of the same charm or import by any means. Yet he was
inordinately proud of such contacts as he could effect and not a
little given to boasting in regard to them, a thing which Clyde
took with more faith than would most, being of less experience. For
this reason Hegglund liked Clyde, almost from the very first,
sensing in him perhaps a pleased and willing auditor.</p>

<p>So, finding Clyde on the bench beside him from time to time, he
had proceeded to continue his instructions. Kansas City was a fine
place to be if you knew how to live. He had worked in other
cities&mdash;Buffalo, Cleveland, Detroit, St. Louis&mdash;before he
came here, but he had not liked any of them any better,
principally&mdash; which was a fact which he did not trouble to
point out at the time&mdash; because he had not done as well in
those places as he had here. He had been a dishwasher, car-cleaner,
plumber's helper and several other things before finally, in
Buffalo, he had been inducted into the hotel business. And then a
youth, working there, but who was now no longer here, had persuaded
him to come on to Kansas City. But here:</p>

<p>"Say&mdash;de tips in dis hotel is as big as you'll git
anywhere, I know dat. An' what's more, dey's nice people workin'
here. You do your bit by dem and dey'll do right by you. I been
here now over a year an' I ain't got no complaint. Dat guy Squires
is all right if you don't cause him no trouble. He's hard, but he's
got to look out for hisself, too&mdash;dat's natural. But he don't
fire nobody unless he's got a reason. I know dat, too. And as for
de rest dere's no trouble. An' when your work's troo, your time's
your own. Dese fellows here are good sports, all o' dem. Dey're no
four-flushers an' no tightwads, eider. Whenever dere's anyting
on&mdash;a good time or sumpin' like dat, dey're on&mdash;nearly
all of 'em. An' dey don't mooch or grouch in case tings don't work
out right, neider. I know dat, cause I been wit 'em now, lots o'
times."</p>

<p>He gave Clyde the impression that these youths were all the best
of friends&mdash;close&mdash;all but Doyle, who was a little
standoffish, but not coldly so. "He's got too many women chasin'
him, dat's all." Also that they went here and there together on
occasion&mdash;to a dance hall, a dinner, a certain gambling joint
down near the river, a certain pleasure resort&mdash;"Kate
Sweeney's"&mdash;where were some peaches of girls&mdash;and so on
and so forth, a world of such information as had never previously
been poured into Clyde's ear, and that set him meditating,
dreaming, doubting, worrying and questioning as to the wisdom,
charm, delight to be found in all this&mdash;also the
permissibility of it in so far as he was concerned. For had he not
been otherwise instructed in regard to all this all his life long?
There was a great thrill and yet a great question involved in all
to which he was now listening so attentively.</p>

<p>Again there was Thomas Ratterer, who was of a type which at
first glance, one would have said, could scarcely prove either
inimical or dangerous to any of the others. He was not more than
five feet four, plump, with black hair and olive skin, and with an
eye that was as limpid as water and as genial as could be. He, too,
as Clyde learned after a time, was of a nondescript family, and so
had profited by no social or financial advantages of any kind. But
he had a way, and was liked by all of these youths&mdash;so much so
that he was consulted about nearly everything. A native of Wichita,
recently moved to Kansas City, he and his sister were the principal
support of a widowed mother. During their earlier and formative
years, both had seen their very good-natured and sympathetic
mother, of whom they were honestly fond, spurned and abused by a
faithless husband. There had been times when they were quite
without food. On more than one occasion they had been ejected for
non-payment of rent. None too continuously Tommy and his sister had
been maintained in various public schools. Finally, at the age of
fourteen he had decamped to Kansas City, where he had secured
different odd jobs, until he succeeded in connecting himself with
the Green-Davidson, and was later joined by his mother and sister
who had removed from Wichita to Kansas City to be with him.</p>

<p>But even more than by the luxury of the hotel or these youths,
whom swiftly and yet surely he was beginning to decipher, Clyde was
impressed by the downpour of small change that was tumbling in upon
him and making a small lump in his right-hand pants
pocket&mdash;dimes, nickels, quarters and half-dollars even, which
increased and increased even on the first day until by nine o'clock
he already had over four dollars in his pocket, and by twelve, at
which hour he went off duty, he had over six and a half&mdash;as
much as previously he had earned in a week.</p>

<p>And of all this, as he then knew, he need only hand Mr. Squires
one&mdash;no more, Hegglund had said&mdash;and the rest, five
dollars and a half, for one evening's interesting&mdash;yes,
delightful and fascinating&mdash;work, belonged to himself. He
could scarcely believe it. It seemed fantastic, Aladdinish, really.
Nevertheless, at twelve, exactly, of that first day a gong had
sounded somewhere&mdash;a shuffle of feet had been heard and three
boys had appeared&mdash;one to take Barnes' place at the desk, the
other two to answer calls. And at the command of Barnes, the eight
who were present were ordered to rise, right dress and march away.
And in the hall outside, and just as he was leaving, Clyde
approached Mr. Squires and handed him a dollar in silver. "That's
right," Mr. Squires remarked. No more. Then, Clyde, along with the
others, descended to his locker, changed his clothes and walked out
into the darkened streets, a sense of luck and a sense of
responsibility as to future luck so thrilling him as to make him
rather tremulous&mdash;giddy, even.</p>

<p>To think that now, at last, he actually had such a place. To
think that he could earn this much every day, maybe. He began to
walk toward his home, his first thought being that he must sleep
well and so be fit for his duties in the morning. But thinking that
he would not need to return to the hotel before 11:30 the next day,
he wandered into an all-night beanery to have a cup of coffee and
some pie. And now all he was thinking was that he would only need
to work from noon until six, when he should be free until the
following morning at six. And then he would make more money. A lot
of it to spend on himself.</p>

<h3>Chapter 8</h3>

<p>The thing that most interested Clyde at first was how, if at
all, he was to keep the major portion of all this money he was
making for himself. For ever since he had been working and earning
money, it had been assumed that he would contribute a fair portion
of all that he received&mdash;at least three-fourths of the smaller
salaries he had received up to this time&mdash;toward the upkeep of
the home. But now, if he announced that he was receiving at least
twenty-five dollars a week and more&mdash;and this entirely apart
from the salary of fifteen a month and board&mdash;his parents
would assuredly expect him to pay ten or twelve.</p>

<p>But so long had he been haunted by the desire to make himself as
attractive looking as any other well-dressed boy that, now that he
had the opportunity, he could not resist the temptation to equip
himself first and as speedily as possible. Accordingly, he decided
to say to his mother that all of the tips he received aggregated no
more than a dollar a day. And, in order to give himself greater
freedom of action in the matter of disposing of his spare time, he
announced that frequently, in addition to the long hours demanded
of him every other day, he was expected to take the place of other
boys who were sick or set to doing other things. And also, he
explained that the management demanded of all boys that they look
well outside as well as inside the hotel. He could not long be seen
coming to the hotel in the clothes that he now wore. Mr. Squires,
he said, had hinted as much. But, as if to soften the blow, one of
the boys at the hotel had told him of a place where he could
procure quite all the things that he needed on time.</p>

<p>And so unsophisticated was his mother in these matters that she
believed him.</p>

<p>But that was not all. He was now daily in contact with a type of
youth who, because of his larger experience with the world and with
the luxuries and vices of such a life as this, had already been
inducted into certain forms of libertinism and vice even which up
to this time were entirely foreign to Clyde's knowledge and set him
agape with wonder and at first with even a timorous distaste. Thus,
as Hegglund had pointed out, a certain percentage of this group, of
which Clyde was now one, made common cause in connection with quite
regular adventures which usually followed their monthly pay night.
These adventures, according to their moods and their cash at the
time, led them usually either to one of two rather famous and not
too respectable all-night restaurants. In groups, as he gathered by
degrees from hearing them talk, they were pleased to indulge in
occasional late showy suppers with drinks, after which they were
wont to go to either some flashy dance hall of the downtown section
to pick up a girl, or that failing as a source of group interest,
to visit some notorious&mdash;or as they would have deemed it
reputed&mdash;brothel, very frequently camouflaged as a boarding
house, where for much less than the amount of cash in their
possession they could, as they often boasted, "have any girl in the
house." And here, of course, because of their known youth,
ignorance, liberality, and uniform geniality and good looks, they
were made much of, as a rule, being made most welcome by the
various madames and girls of these places who sought, for
commercial reasons of course, to interest them to come again.</p>

<p>And so starved had been Clyde's life up to this time and so
eager was he for almost any form of pleasure, that from the first
he listened with all too eager ears to any account of anything that
spelled adventure or pleasure. Not that he approved of these types
of adventures. As a matter of fact at first it offended and
depressed him, seeing as he did that it ran counter to all he had
heard and been told to believe these many years. Nevertheless so
sharp a change and relief from the dreary and repressed work in
which he had been brought up was it, that he could not help
thinking of all this with an itch for the variety and color it
seemed to suggest. He listened sympathetically and eagerly, even
while at times he was mentally disapproving of what he heard. And
seeing him so sympathetic and genial, first one and then another of
these youths made overtures to him to go here, there or the other
place&mdash;to a show, a restaurant, one of their homes, where a
card game might be indulged in by two or three of them, or even to
one of the shameless houses, contact with which Clyde at first
resolutely refused. But by degrees, becoming familiar with Hegglund
and Ratterer, both of whom he liked very much, and being invited by
them to a joy-night supper&mdash;a "blow-out" as they termed it, at
Frissell's&mdash;he decided to go.</p>

<p>"There's going to be another one of our montly blow-outs
to-morrow night, Clyde, around at Frissell's," Ratterer had said to
him. "Don't you want to come along? You haven't been yet."</p>

<p>By this time, Clyde, having acclimated himself to this caloric
atmosphere, was by no means as dubious as he was at first. For by
now, in imitation of Doyle, whom he had studied most carefully and
to great advantage, he had outfitted himself with a new brown suit,
cap, overcoat, socks, stickpin and shoes as near like those of his
mentor as possible. And the costume became him
well&mdash;excellently well&mdash;so much so that he was far more
attractive than he had ever been in his life, and now, not only his
parents, but his younger brother and sister, were not a little
astonished and even amazed by the change.</p>

<p>How could Clyde have come by all this grandeur so speedily? How
much could all this that he wore now have cost? Was he not
hypothecating more of his future earnings for this temporary
grandeur than was really wise? He might need it in the future. The
other children needed things, too. And was the moral and spiritual
atmosphere of a place that made him work such long hours and kept
him out so late every day, and for so little pay, just the place to
work?</p>

<p>To all of which, he had replied, rather artfully for him, that
it was all for the best, he was not working too hard. His clothes
were not too fine, by any means&mdash;his mother should see some of
the other boys. He was not spending too much money. And, anyhow, he
had a long while in which to pay for all he had bought.</p>

<p>But now, as to this supper. That was a different matter, even to
him. How, he asked himself, in case the thing lasted until very
late as was expected, could he explain to his mother and father his
remaining out so very late. Ratterer had said it might last until
three or four, anyhow, although he might go, of course, any time,
but how would that look, deserting the crowd? And yet hang it all,
most of them did not live at home as he did, or if they did like
Ratterer, they had parents who didn't mind what they did. Still, a
late supper like that&mdash;was it wise? All these boys drank and
thought nothing of it&mdash;Hegglund, Ratterer, Kinsella, Shiel. It
must be silly for him to think that there was so much danger in
drinking a little, as they did on these occasions. On the other
hand it was true that he need not drink unless he wanted to. He
could go, and if anything was said at home, he would say that he
had to work late. What difference did it make if he stayed out late
once in a while? Wasn't he a man now? Wasn't he making more money
than any one else in the family? And couldn't he begin to do as he
pleased?</p>

<p>He began to sense the delight of personal freedom&mdash;to sniff
the air of personal and delicious romance&mdash;and he was not to
be held back by any suggestion which his mother could now make.</p>

<h3>Chapter 9</h3>

<p>And so the interesting dinner, with Clyde attending, came to
pass. And it was partaken of at Frissell's, as Ratterer had said.
And by now Clyde, having come to be on genial terms with all of
these youths, was in the gayest of moods about it all. Think of his
new state in life, anyhow. Only a few weeks ago he was all alone,
not a boy friend, scarcely a boy acquaintance in the world! And
here he was, so soon after, going to this fine dinner with this
interesting group.</p>

<p>And true to the illusions of youth, the place appeared far more
interesting than it really was. It was little more than an
excellent chop-house of the older American order. Its walls were
hung thick with signed pictures of actors and actresses, together
with playbills of various periods. And because of the general
excellence of the food, to say nothing of the geniality of its
present manager, it had become the hangout of passing actors,
politicians, local business men, and after them, the generality of
followers who are always drawn by that which presents something a
little different to that with which they are familiar.</p>

<p>And these boys, having heard at one time and another from cab
and taxi drivers that this was one of the best places in town,
fixed upon it for their monthly dinners. Single plates of anything
cost from sixty cents to a dollar. Coffee and tea were served in
pots only. You could get anything you wanted to drink. To the left
of the main room as you went in was a darker and low-ceilinged room
with a fireplace, to which only men resorted and sat and smoked,
and read papers after dinner, and it was for this room that these
youths reserved their greatest admiration. Eating here, they
somehow felt older, wiser, more important&mdash;real men of the
world. And Ratterer and Hegglund, to whom by now Clyde had become
very much attached, as well as most of the others, were satisfied
that there was not another place in all Kansas City that was really
as good.</p>

<p>And so this day, having drawn their pay at noon, and being off
at six for the night, they gathered outside the hotel at the corner
nearest the drug store at which Clyde had originally applied for
work, and were off in a happy, noisy frame of mind&mdash;Hegglund,
Ratterer, Paul Shiel, Davis Higby, another youth, Arthur Kinsella
and Clyde.</p>

<p>"Didja hear de trick de guy from St. Louis pulled on the main
office yesterday?" Hegglund inquired of the crowd generally, as
they started walking. "Wires last Saturday from St. Louis for a
parlor, bedroom and bat for himself and wife, an' orders flowers
put in de room. Jimmy, the key clerk, was just tellin' me. Den he
comes on here and registers himself an' his girl, see, as man and
wife, an', gee, a peach of a lookin' girl, too&mdash;I saw 'em.
Listen, you fellows, cantcha? Den, on Wednesday, after he's been
here tree days and dey're beginnin' to wonder about him a
little&mdash;meals sent to de room and all dat&mdash;he comes down
and says dat his wife's gotta go back to St. Louis, and dat he
won't need no suite, just one room, and dat they can transfer his
trunk and her bags to de new room until train time for her. But de
trunk ain't his at all, see, but hers. And she ain't goin', don't
know nuttin about it. But he is. Den he beats it, see, and leaves
her and de trunk in de room. And widout a bean, see? Now, dey're
holdin' her and her trunk, an' she's cryin' and wirin' friends, and
dere's hell to pay all around. Can ya beat dat? An' de flowers,
too. Roses. An' six different meals in de room and drinks for him,
too."</p>

<p>"Sure, I know the one you mean," exclaimed Paul Shiel. "I took
up some drinks myself. I felt there was something phony about that
guy. He was too smooth and loud-talking. An' he only comes across
with a dime at that."</p>

<p>"I remember him, too," exclaimed Ratterer. "He sent me down for
all the Chicago papers Monday an' only give me a dime. He looked
like a bluff to me."</p>

<p>"Well, dey fell for him up in front, all right." It was Hegglund
talking. "An' now dey're tryin' to gouge it outa her. Can you beat
it?"</p>

<p>"She didn't look to me to be more than eighteen or twenty, if
she's that old," put in Arthur Kinsella, who up to now had said
nothing.</p>

<p>"Did you see either of 'em, Clyde?" inquired Ratterer, who was
inclined to favor and foster Clyde and include him in
everything.</p>

<p>"No" replied Clyde. "I must have missed those two. I don't
remember seeing either of 'em."</p>

<p>"Well, you missed seein' a bird when you missed that one. Tall,
long black cut-a-way coat, wide, black derby pulled low over his
eyes, pearl-gray spats, too. I thought he was an English duke or
something at first, the way he walked, and with a cane, too. All
they gotta do is pull that English stuff, an' talk loud an' order
everybody about an' they get by with it every time."</p>

<p>"That's right," commented Davis Higby. "That's good stuff, that
English line. I wouldn't mind pulling some of it myself
sometime."</p>

<p>They had now turned two corners, crossed two different streets
and, in group formation, were making their way through the main
door of Frissell's, which gave in on the reflection of lights upon
china and silverware and faces, and the buzz and clatter of a
dinner crowd. Clyde was enormously impressed. Never before, apart
from the Green-Davidson, had he been in such a place. And with such
wise, experienced youths.</p>

<p>They made their way to a group of tables which faced a leather
wall-seat. The head-waiter, recognizing Ratterer and Hegglund and
Kinsella as old patrons, had two tables put together and butter and
bread and glasses brought. About these they arranged themselves,
Clyde with Ratterer and Higby occupying the wall seat; Hegglund,
Kinsella and Shiel sitting opposite.</p>

<p>"Now, me for a good old Manhattan, to begin wit'," exclaimed
Hegglund avidly, looking about on the crowd in the room and feeling
that now indeed he was a person. Of a reddish-tan hue, his eyes
keen and blue, his reddish-brown hair brushed straight up from his
forehead, he seemed not unlike a large and overzealous rooster.</p>

<p>And similarly, Arthur Kinsella, once he was in here, seemed to
perk up and take heart of his present glory. In a sort of
ostentatious way, he drew back his coat sleeves, seized a bill of
fare, and scanning the drink-list on the back, exclaimed: "Well, a
dry Martini is good enough for a start."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm going to begin with a Scotch and soda," observed Paul
Shiel, solemnly, examining at the same time the meat orders.</p>

<p>"None of your cocktails for me to-night," insisted Ratterer,
genially, but with a note of reserve in his voice. "I said I wasn t
going to drink much to-night, and I'm not. I think a glass of Rhine
wine and seltzer will be about my speed."</p>

<p>"For de love o' Mike, will you listen to dat, now," exclaimed
Hegglund, deprecatingly. "He's goin' to begin on Rhine wine. And
him dat likes Manhattans always. What's gettin' into you all of a
sudden, Tommy? I t'ought you said you wanted a good time
to-night."</p>

<p>"So I do," replied Ratterer, "but can't I have a good time
without lappin' up everything in the place? I want to stay sober
to-night. No more call-downs for me in the morning, if I know what
I'm about. I came pretty near not showing up last time."</p>

<p>"That's true, too," exclaimed Arthur Kinsella. "I don't want to
drink so much I don't know where I'm at, but I'm not going to begin
worrying about it now."</p>

<p>"How about you, Higby?" Hegglund now called to the round-eyed
youth.</p>

<p>"I'm having a Manhattan, too," he replied, and then, looking up
at the waiter who was beside him, added, "How's tricks,
Dennis?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I can't complain," replied the waiter. "They're breakin'
all right for me these days. How's everything over to the
hotel?"</p>

<p>"Fine, fine," replied Higby, cheerfully, studying the
bill-of-fare.</p>

<p>"An' you, Griffiths? What are you goin' to have?" called
Hegglund, for, as master-of-ceremonies, delegated by the others to
look after the orders and pay the bill and tip the waiter, he was
now fulfilling the role.</p>

<p>"Who, me? Oh, me," exclaimed Clyde, not a little disturbed by
this inquiry, for up to now&mdash;this very hour, in fact&mdash;he
had never touched anything stronger than coffee or ice-cream soda.
He had been not a little taken back by the brisk and sophisticated
way in which these youths ordered cocktails and whisky. Surely he
could not go so far as that, and yet, so well had he known long
before this, from the conversation of these youths, that on such
occasions as this they did drink, that he did not see how he could
very well hold back. What would they think of him if he didn't
drink something? For ever since he had been among them, he had been
trying to appear as much of a man of the world as they were. And
yet back of him, as he could plainly feel, lay all of the years in
which he had been drilled in the "horrors" of drink and evil
companionship. And even though in his heart this long while he had
secretly rebelled against nearly all the texts and maxims to which
his parents were always alluding, deeply resenting really as
worthless and pointless the ragamuffin crew of wasters and failures
whom they were always seeking to save, still, now he was inclined
to think and hesitate. Should he or should he not drink?</p>

<p>For the fraction of an instant only, while all these things in
him now spoke, he hesitated, then added: "Why, I, oh&mdash;I think
I'll take Rhine wine and seltzer, too." It was the easiest and
safest thing to say, as he saw it. Already the rather temperate and
even innocuous character of Rhine wine and seltzer had been
emphasized by Hegglund and all the others. And yet Ratterer was
taking it&mdash;a thing which made his choice less conspicuous and,
as he felt, less ridiculous.</p>

<p>"Will you listen to dis now?" exclaimed Hegglund, dramatically.
"He says he'll have Rhine wine and seltzer, too. I see where dis
party breaks up at half-past eight, all right, unless some of de
rest of us do someting."</p>

<p>And Davis Higby, who was far more trenchant and roistering than
his pleasant exterior gave any indication of, turned to Ratterer
and said: "Whatja want to start this Rhine wine and seltzer stuff
for, so soon, Tom? Dontcha want us to have any fun at all
to-night?"</p>

<p>"Well, I told you why," said Ratterer. "Besides, the last time I
went down to that joint I had forty bucks when I went in and not a
cent when I came out. I want to know what's goin' on this
time."</p>

<p>"That joint," thought Clyde on hearing it. Then, after this
supper, when they had all drunk and eaten enough, they were going
down to one of those places called a "joint"&mdash;a bad-house,
really. There was no doubt of it&mdash;he knew what the word meant.
There would be women there&mdash;bad women&mdash;evil women. And he
would be expected&mdash; could he&mdash;would he?</p>

<p>For the first time in his life now, he found himself confronted
by a choice as to his desire for the more accurate knowledge of the
one great fascinating mystery that had for so long confronted and
fascinated and baffled and yet frightened him a little. For,
despite all his many thoughts in regard to all this and women in
general, he had never been in contact with any one of them in this
way. And now&mdash;now&mdash;</p>

<p>All of a sudden he felt faint thrills of hot and cold racing up
and down his back and all over him. His hands and face grew hot and
then became moist&mdash;then his cheeks and forehead flamed. He
could feel them. Strange, swift, enticing and yet disturbing
thoughts raced in and out of his consciousness. His hair tingled
and he saw pictures&mdash;bacchanalian scenes&mdash;which swiftly,
and yet in vain, he sought to put out of his mind. They would keep
coming back. And he wanted them to come back. Yet he did not. And
through it all he was now a little afraid. Pshaw! Had he no courage
at all? These other fellows were not disturbed by the prospects of
what was before them. They were very gay. They were already
beginning to laugh and kid one another in regard to certain funny
things that had happened the last time they were all out together.
But what would his mother think if she knew? His mother! He dared
not think of his mother or his father either at this time, and put
them both resolutely out of his mind.</p>

<p>"Oh, say, Kinsella," called Higby. "Do you remember that little
red head in that Pacific Street joint that wanted you to run away
to Chicago with her?"</p>

<p>"Do I?" replied the amused Kinsella, taking up the Martini that
was just then served him. "She even wanted me to quit the hotel
game and let her start me in a business of some kind. 'I wouldn't
need to work at all if I stuck by her,' she told me."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, you wouldn't need to work at all, except one way,"
called Ratterer.</p>

<p>The waiter put down Clyde's glass of Rhine wine and seltzer
beside him and, interested and intense and troubled and fascinated
by all that he heard, he picked it up, tasted it and, finding it
mild and rather pleasing, drank it all down at once. And yet so
wrought up were his thoughts that he scarcely realized then that he
had drunk it.</p>

<p>"Good for you," observed Kinsella, in a most cordial tone. "You
must like that stuff."</p>

<p>"Oh, it's not so bad," said Clyde.</p>

<p>And Hegglund, seeing how swiftly it had gone, and feeling that
Clyde, new to this world and green, needed to be cheered and
strengthened, called to the waiter: "Here Jerry! One more of these,
and make it a big one," he whispered behind his hand.</p>

<p>And so the dinner proceeded. And it was nearly eleven before
they had exhausted the various matters of interest to
them&mdash;stories of past affairs, past jobs, past feats of
daring. And by then Clyde had had considerable time to meditate on
all of these youths&mdash;and he was inclined to think that he was
not nearly as green as they thought, or if so, at least shrewder
than most of them&mdash;of a better mentality, really. For who were
they and what were their ambitions? Hegglund, as he could see, was
vain and noisy and foolish&mdash;a person who could be taken in and
conciliated by a little flattery. And Higby and Kinsella,
interesting and attractive boys both, were still vain of things he
could not be proud of&mdash;Higby of knowing a little something
about automobiles&mdash;he had an uncle in the
business&mdash;Kinsella of gambling, rolling dice even. And as for
Ratterer and Shiel, he could see and had noticed for some time,
that they were content with the bell-hop business&mdash;just
continuing in that and nothing more&mdash;a thing which he could
not believe, even now, would interest him forever.</p>

<p>At the same time, being confronted by this problem of how soon
they would be wanting to go to a place into which he had never
ventured before, and to be doing things which he had never let
himself think he would do in just this way, he was just a little
disturbed. Had he not better excuse himself after they got outside,
or perhaps, after starting along with them in whatsoever direction
they chose to go, quietly slip away at some corner and return to
his own home? For had he not already heard that the most dreadful
of diseases were occasionally contracted in just such
places&mdash;and that men died miserable deaths later because of
low vices begun in this fashion? He could hear his mother lecturing
concerning all this&mdash;yet with scarcely any direct knowledge of
any kind. And yet, as an argument per contra, here were all of
these boys in nowise disturbed by what was in their minds or moods
to do. On the contrary, they were very gay over it all and
amused&mdash;nothing more.</p>

<p>In fact, Ratterer, who was really very fond of Clyde by now,
more because of the way he looked and inquired and listened than
because of anything Clyde did or said, kept nudging him with his
elbow now and then, asking laughingly, "How about it, Clyde? Going
to be initiated to-night?" and then smiling broadly. Or finding
Clyde quite still and thinking at times, "They won't do more than
bite you, Clyde."</p>

<p>And Hegglund, taking his cue from Ratterer and occasionally
desisting from his own self-glorifying diatribes, would add: "You
won't ever be de same, Clyde. Dey never are. But we'll all be wid
you in case of trouble."</p>

<p>And Clyde, nervous and irritated, would retort: "Ah, cut it out,
you two. Quit kidding. What's the use of trying to make out that
you know so much more than I do?"</p>

<p>And Ratterer would signal Hegglund with his eyes to let up and
would occasionally whisper to Clyde: "That's all right, old man,
don't get sore. You know we were just fooling, that's all." And
Clyde, very much drawn to Ratterer, would relent and wish he were
not so foolish as to show what he actually was thinking about.</p>

<p>At last, however, by eleven o'clock, they had had their fill of
conversation and food and drink and were ready to depart, Hegglund
leading the way. And instead of the vulgar and secretive mission
producing a kind of solemnity and mental or moral self-examination
and self-flagellation, they laughed and talked as though there was
nothing but a delicious form of amusement before them. Indeed, much
to Clyde's disgust and amazement, they now began to reminisce
concerning other ventures into this world&mdash;of one particular
one which seemed to amuse them all greatly, and which seemed to
concern some "joint," as they called it, which they had once
visited&mdash;a place called "Bettina's." They had been led there
originally by a certain wild youth by the name of "Pinky" Jones of
the staff of another local hotel. And this boy and one other by the
name of Birmingham, together with Hegglund, who had become wildly
intoxicated, had there indulged in wild pranks which all but led to
their arrest&mdash;pranks which to Clyde, as he listened to them,
seemed scarcely possible to boys of this caliber and cleanly
appearance&mdash; pranks so crude and disgusting as to sicken him a
little.</p>

<p>"Oh, ho, and de pitcher of water de girl on de second floor
doused on me as I went out," called Hegglund, laughing
heartily.</p>

<p>"And the big fat guy on the second floor that came to the door
to see. Remember?" laughed Kinsella. "He thought there was a fire
or a riot, I bet."</p>

<p>"And you and that little fat girl, Piggy. 'Member, Ratterer?"
squealed Shiel, laughing and choking as he tried to tell of it.</p>

<p>"And Ratterer's legs all bent under his load. Yoo-hoo!" yelled
Hegglund. "And de way de two of 'em finally slid down de
steps."</p>

<p>"That was all your fault, Hegglund," called Higby from
Kinsella's side. "If you hadn't tried that switching stuff we never
woulda got put out."</p>

<p>"I tell you I was drunk," protested Ratterer. "It was the
red-eye they sold in there."</p>

<p>"And that long, thin guy from Texas with the big mustache, will
you ever forget him, an' the way he laughed?" added Kinsella. "He
wouldn't help nobody 'gainst us. 'Member?"</p>

<p>"It's a wonder we weren't all thrown in the street or locked up.
Oh, gee, what a night!" reminisced Ratterer.</p>

<p>By now Clyde was faintly dizzy with the nature of these
revelations. "Switchin'." That could mean but one thing.</p>

<p>And they expected him to share in revels such as these, maybe.
It could not be. He was not that sort of person. What would his
mother and father think if they were to hear of such dreadful
things? And yet&mdash;</p>

<p>Even as they talked, they had reached a certain house in a dark
and rather wide street, the curbs of which for a block or more on
either side were sprinkled with cabs and cars. And at the corner,
only a little distance away, were some young men standing and
talking. And over the way, more men. And not a half a block farther
on, they passed two policemen, idling and conversing. And although
there was no light visible in any window, nor over any transom,
still, curiously, there was a sense of vivid, radiant life. One
could feel it in this dark street. Taxis spun and honked and two
old-time closed carriages still in use rolled here and there, their
curtains drawn. And doors slammed or opened and closed. And now and
then a segment of bright inward light pierced the outward gloom and
then disappeared again. Overhead on this night were many stars.</p>

<p>Finally, without any comment from any one, Hegglund, accompanied
by Higby and Shiel, marched up the steps of this house and rang the
bell. Almost instantly the door was opened by a black girl in a red
dress. "Good evening. Walk right in, won't you?" was the affable
greeting, and the six, having pushed past her and through the
curtains of heavy velvet, which separated this small area from the
main chambers, Clyde found himself in a bright and rather gaudy
general parlor or reception room, the walls of which were
ornamented with gilt-framed pictures of nude or semi-nude girls and
some very high pier mirrors. And the floor was covered by a bright
red thick carpet, over which were strewn many gilt chairs. At the
back, before some very bright red hangings, was a gilded upright
piano. But of guests or inmates there seemed to be none, other than
the black girl.</p>

<p>"Jest be seated, won't you? Make yourselves at home. I'll call
the madam." And, running upstairs to the left, she began calling:
"Oh, Marie! Sadie! Caroline! They is some young gentlemen in the
parlor."</p>

<p>And at that moment, from a door in the rear, there emerged a
tall, slim and rather pale-faced woman of about thirty-eight or
forty&mdash; very erect, very executive, very intelligent and
graceful-looking&mdash; diaphanously and yet modestly garbed, who
said, with a rather wan and yet encouraging smile: "Oh, hello,
Oscar, it's you, is it? And you too, Paul. Hello! Hello, Davis!
Just make yourselves at home anywhere, all of you. Fannie will be
in in a minute. She'll bring you something to drink. I've just
hired a new pianist from St. Joe&mdash;a Negro. Wait'll you hear
him. He's awfully clever."</p>

<p>She returned to the rear and called, "Oh, Sam!"</p>

<p>As she did so, nine girls of varying ages and looks, but none
apparently over twenty-four or five&mdash;came trooping down the
stairs at one side in the rear, and garbed as Clyde had never seen
any women dressed anywhere. And they were all laughing and talking
as they came&mdash;evidently very well pleased with themselves and
in nowise ashamed of their appearance, which in some instances was
quite extraordinary, as Clyde saw it, their costumes ranging from
the gayest and flimsiest of boudoir negligees to the somewhat more
sober, if no less revealing, dancing and ballroom gowns. And they
were of such varied types and sizes and complexions&mdash;slim and
stout and medium&mdash;tall or short&mdash;and dark or light or
betwixt. And, whatever their ages, all seemed young. And they
smiled so warmly and enthusiastically.</p>

<p>"Oh, hello, sweetheart! How are you? Don't you want to dance
with me?" or "Wouldn't you like something to drink?"</p>

<h3>Chapter 10</h3>

<p>Prepared as Clyde was to dislike all this, so steeped had he
been in the moods and maxims antipathetic to anything of its kind,
still so innately sensual and romantic was his own disposition and
so starved where sex was concerned, that instead of being sickened,
he was quite fascinated. The very fleshly sumptuousness of most of
these figures, dull and unromantic as might be the brains that
directed them, interested him for the time being. After all, here
was beauty of a gross, fleshly character, revealed and purchasable.
And there were no difficulties of mood or inhibitions to overcome
in connection with any of these girls. One of them, a quite pretty
brunette in a black and red costume with a band of red ribbon
across her forehead, seemed to be decidedly at home with Higby, for
already she was dancing with him in the back room to a jazz melody
most irrationally hammered out upon the piano.</p>

<p>And Ratterer, to Clyde's surprise, was already seated upon one
of the gilt chairs and upon his knees was lounging a tall young
girl with very light hair and blue eyes. And she was smoking a
cigarette and tapping her gold slippers to the melody of the piano.
It was really quite an amazing and Aladdin-like scene to him. And
here was Hegglund, before whom was standing a German or
Scandinavian type, plump and pretty, her arms akimbo and her feet
wide apart. And she was asking&mdash;with an upward swell of the
voice, as Clyde could hear: "You make love to me to-night?" But
Hegglund, apparently not very much taken with these overtures,
calmly shook his head, after which she went on to Kinsella.</p>

<p>And even as he was looking and thinking, a quite attractive
blonde girl of not less than twenty-four, but who seemed younger to
Clyde, drew up a chair beside him and seating herself, said: "Don't
you dance?" He shook his head nervously. "Want me to show you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I wouldn't want to try here," he said.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's easy," she continued. "Come on!" But since he would
not, though he was rather pleased with her for being agreeable to
him, she added: "Well, how about something to drink then?"</p>

<p>"Sure," he agreed, gallantly, and forthwith she signaled the
young Negress who had returned as waitress, and in a moment a small
table was put before them and a bottle of whisky with soda on the
side&mdash;a sight that so astonished and troubled Clyde that he
could scarcely speak. He had forty dollars in his pocket, and the
cost of drinks here, as he had heard from the others, would not be
less than two dollars each, but even so, think of him buying drinks
for such a woman at such a price! And his mother and sisters and
brother at home with scarcely the means to make ends meet. And yet
he bought and paid for several, feeling all the while that he had
let himself in for a terrifying bit of extravagance, if not an
orgy, but now that he was here, he must go through with it.</p>

<p>And besides, as he now saw, this girl was really pretty. She had
on a Delft blue evening gown of velvet, with slippers and stockings
to match. In her ears were blue earrings and her neck and shoulders
and arms were plump and smooth. The most disturbing thing about her
was that her bodice was cut very low&mdash;he dared scarcely look
at her there&mdash;and her cheeks and lips were painted&mdash; most
assuredly the marks of the scarlet woman. Yet she did not seem very
aggressive, in fact quite human, and she kept looking rather
interestedly at his deep and dark and nervous eyes.</p>

<p>"You work over at the Green-Davidson, too, don't you?" she
asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Clyde trying to appear as if all this were not
new to him&mdash;as if he had often been in just such a place as
this, amid such scenes. "How did you know?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I know Oscar Hegglund," she replied. "He comes around here
once in a while. Is he a friend of yours?"</p>

<p>"Yes. That is, he works over at the hotel with me."</p>

<p>"But you haven't been here before."</p>

<p>"No," said Clyde, swiftly, and yet with a trace of inquiry in
his own mood. Why should she say he hadn't been here before?</p>

<p>"I thought you hadn't. I've seen most of these other boys
before, but I never saw you. You haven't been working over at the
hotel very long, have you?"</p>

<p>"No," said Clyde, a little irritated by this, his eyebrows and
the skin of his forehead rising and falling as he talked&mdash;a
form of contraction and expansion that went on involuntarily
whenever he was nervous or thought deeply. "What of it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing. I just knew you hadn't. You don't look very much
like these other boys&mdash;you look different." She smiled oddly
and rather ingratiatingly, a smile and a mood which Clyde failed to
interpret.</p>

<p>"How different?" he inquired, solemnly and contentiously, taking
up a glass and drinking from it.</p>

<p>"I'll bet you one thing," she went on, ignoring his inquiry
entirely. "You don't care for girls like me very much, do you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I do, too," he said, evasively.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, you don't either. I can tell. But I like you just the
same. I like your eyes. You're not like those other fellows. You're
more refined, kinda. I can tell. You don't look like them."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know," replied Clyde, very much pleased and
flattered, his forehead wrinkling and clearing as before. This girl
was certainly not as bad as he thought, maybe. She was more
intelligent&mdash;a little more refined than the others. Her
costume was not so gross. And she hadn't thrown herself upon him as
had these others upon Hegglund, Higby, Kinsella and Ratterer.
Nearly all of the group by now were seated upon chairs or divans
about the room and upon their knees were girls. And in front of
every couple was a little table with a bottle of whisky upon
it.</p>

<p>"Look who's drinking whisky!" called Kinsella to such of the
others as would pay any attention to him, glancing in Clyde's
direction.</p>

<p>"Well, you needn't be afraid of me," went on the girl, while
Clyde glanced at her arms and neck, at her too much revealed bosom,
which quite chilled and yet enticed him. "I haven't been so very
long in this business. And I wouldn't be here now if it hadn't been
for all the bad luck I've had. I'd rather live at home with my
family if I could, only they wouldn't have me, now." She looked
rather solemnly at the floor, thinking mainly of the little
inexperienced dunce Clyde was&mdash;so raw and green. Also of the
money she had seen him take out of his pocket&mdash;plainly quite a
sum. Also how really good-looking he was, not handsome or vigorous,
but pleasing. And he was thinking at the instant of Esta, as to
where she had gone or was now. What might have befallen
her&mdash;who could say? What might have been done to her? Had this
girl, by any chance, ever had any such unfortunate experience as
she had had? He felt a growing, if somewhat grandiose, sympathy,
and looked at her as much as to say: "You poor thing." Yet for the
moment he would not trust himself to say anything or make any
further inquiries.</p>

<p>"You fellows who come into a place like this always think so
hard of everybody. I know how you are. But we're not as bad as you
think."</p>

<p>Clyde's brows knit and smoothed again. Perhaps she was not as
bad as he thought. She was a low woman, no doubt&mdash;evil but
pretty. In fact, as he looked about the room from time to time,
none of the girls appealed to him more. And she thought him better
than these other boys&mdash;more refined&mdash;she had detected
that. The compliment stuck. Presently she was filling his glass for
him and urging him to drink with her. Another group of young men
arrived about then&mdash; and other girls coming out of the
mysterious portals at the rear to greet them&mdash;Hegglund and
Ratterer and Kinsella and Higby, as he saw, mysteriously
disappeared up that back stairs that was heavily curtained from the
general room. And as these others came in, this girl invited him to
come and sit upon a divan in the back room where the lights were
dimmer.</p>

<p>And now, seated here, she had drawn very close to him and
touched his hands and finally linking an arm in his and pressing
close to him, inquired if he didn't want to see how pretty some of
the rooms on the second floor were furnished. And seeing that he
was quite alone now&mdash;not one of all the group with whom he had
come around to observe him&mdash;and that this girl seemed to lean
to him warmly and sympathetically, he allowed himself to be led up
that curtained back stair and into a small pink and blue furnished
room, while he kept saying to himself that this was an outrageous
and dangerous proceeding on his part, and that it might well end in
misery for him. He might contract some dreadful disease. She might
charge him more than he could afford. He was afraid of
her&mdash;himself&mdash; everything, really&mdash;quite nervous and
almost dumb with his several fears and qualms. And yet he went,
and, the door locked behind him, this interestingly well-rounded
and graceful Venus turned the moment they were within and held him
to her, then calmly, and before a tall mirror which revealed her
fully to herself and him, began to disrobe.</p>

<h3>Chapter 11</h3>

<p>The effect of this adventure on Clyde was such as might have
been expected in connection with one so new and strange to such a
world as this. In spite of all that deep and urgent curiosity and
desire that had eventually led him to that place and caused him to
yield, still, because of the moral precepts with which he had so
long been familiar, and also because of the nervous esthetic
inhibitions which were characteristic of him, he could not but look
back upon all this as decidedly degrading and sinful. His parents
were probably right when they preached that this was all low and
shameful. And yet this whole adventure and the world in which it
was laid, once it was all over, was lit with a kind of gross, pagan
beauty or vulgar charm for him. And until other and more
interesting things had partially effaced it, he could not help
thinking back upon it with considerable interest and pleasure,
even.</p>

<p>In addition he kept telling himself that now, having as much
money as he was making, he could go and do about as he pleased. He
need not go there any more if he did not want to, but he could go
to other places that might not be as low, maybe&mdash;more refined.
He wouldn't want to go with a crowd like that again. He would
rather have just one girl somewhere if he could find her&mdash;a
girl such as those with whom he had seen Sieberling and Doyle
associate. And so, despite all of his troublesome thoughts of the
night before, he was thus won quickly over to this new source of
pleasure if not its primary setting. He must find a free pagan girl
of his own somewhere if he could, like Doyle, and spend his money
on her. And he could scarcely wait until opportunity should provide
him with the means of gratifying himself in this way.</p>

<p>But more interesting and more to his purpose at the time was the
fact that both Hegglund and Ratterer, in spite of, or possibly
because of, a secret sense of superiority which they detected in
Clyde, were inclined to look upon him with no little interest and
to court him and to include him among all their thoughts of affairs
and pleasures. Indeed, shortly after his first adventure, Ratterer
invited him to come to his home, where, as Clyde most quickly came
to see, was a life very different from his own. At the Griffiths'
all was so solemn and reserved, the still moods of those who feel
the pressure of dogma and conviction. In Ratterer's home, the
reverse of this was nearly true. The mother and sister with whom he
lived, while not without some moral although no particular
religious convictions, were inclined to view life with a great deal
of generosity or, as a moralist would have seen it, laxity. There
had never been any keen moral or characterful direction there at
all. And so it was that Ratterer and his sister Louise, who was two
years younger than himself, now did about as they pleased, and
without thinking very much about it. But his sister chanced to be
shrewd or individual enough not to wish to cast herself away on
just any one.</p>

<p>The interesting part of all this was that Clyde, in spite of a
certain strain of refinement which caused him to look askance at
most of this, was still fascinated by the crude picture of life and
liberty which it offered. Among such as these, at least, he could
go, do, be as he had never gone or done or been before. And
particularly was he pleased and enlightened&mdash;or rather
dubiously liberated&mdash;in connection with his nervousness and
uncertainty in regard to his charm or fascination for girls of his
own years. For up to this very time, and in spite of his recent
first visit to the erotic temple to which Hegglund and the others
had led him, he was still convinced that he had no skill with or
charm where girls were concerned. Their mere proximity or approach
was sufficient to cause him to recede mentally, to chill or
palpitate nervously, and to lose what little natural skill he had
for conversation or poised banter such as other youths possessed.
But now, in his visits to the home of Ratterer, as he soon
discovered, he was to have ample opportunity to test whether this
shyness and uncertainty could be overcome.</p>

<p>For it was a center for the friends of Ratterer and his sister,
who were more or less of one mood in regard to life. Dancing,
card-playing, love-making rather open and unashamed, went on there.
Indeed, up to this time, Clyde would not have imagined that a
parent like Mrs. Ratterer could have been as lackadaisical or
indifferent as she was, apparently, to conduct and morals
generally. He would not have imagined that any mother would have
countenanced the easy camaraderie that existed between the sexes in
Mrs. Ratterer's home.</p>

<p>And very soon, because of several cordial invitations which were
extended to him by Ratterer, he found himself part and parcel of
this group&mdash;a group which from one point of view&mdash;the
ideas held by its members, the rather wretched English they
spoke&mdash;he looked down upon. From another point of
view&mdash;the freedom they possessed, the zest with which they
managed to contrive social activities and exchanges&mdash;he was
drawn to them. Because, for the first time, these permitted him, if
he chose, to have a girl of his own, if only he could summon the
courage. And this, owing to the well-meant ministrations of
Ratterer and his sister and their friends, he soon sought to
accomplish. Indeed the thing began on the occasion of his first
visit to the Ratterers.</p>

<p>Louise Ratterer worked in a dry-goods store and often came home
a little late for dinner. On this occasion she did not appear until
seven, and the eating of the family meal was postponed accordingly.
In the meantime, two girl friends of Louise arrived to consult her
in connection with something, and finding her delayed, and Ratterer
and Clyde there, they made themselves at home, rather impressed and
interested by Clyde and his new finery. For he, at once girl-hungry
and girl-shy, held himself nervously aloof, a manifestation which
they mistook for a conviction of superiority on his part. And in
consequence, arrested by this, they determined to show how really
interesting they were&mdash;vamp him&mdash;no less. And he found
their crude briskness and effrontery very appealing&mdash;so much
so that he was soon taken by the charms of one, a certain Hortense
Briggs, who, like Louise, was nothing more than a crude shop girl
in one of the large stores, but pretty and dark and
self-appreciative. And yet from the first, he realized that she was
not a little coarse and vulgar&mdash;a very long way removed from
the type of girl he had been imagining in his dreams that he would
like to have.</p>

<p>"Oh, hasn't she come in yet?" announced Hortense, on first being
admitted by Ratterer and seeing Clyde near one of the front
windows, looking out. "Isn't that too bad? Well, we'll just have to
wait a little bit if you don't mind"&mdash;this last with a switch
and a swagger that plainly said, who would mind having us around?
And forthwith she began to primp and admire herself before a mirror
which surmounted an ocher-colored mantelpiece that graced a
fireless grate in the dining-room. And her friend, Greta Miller,
added: "Oh, dear, yes. I hope you won't make us go before she
comes. We didn't come to eat. We thought your dinner would be all
over by now."</p>

<p>"Where do you get that stuff&mdash;'put you out'?" replied
Ratterer cynically. "As though anybody could drive you two outa
here if you didn't want to go. Sit down and play the victrola or do
anything you like. Dinner'll soon be ready and Louise'll be here
any minute." He returned to the dining-room to look at a paper
which he had been reading, after pausing to introduce Clyde. And
the latter, because of the looks and the airs of these two, felt
suddenly as though he had been cast adrift upon a chartless sea in
an open boat.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't say eat to me!" exclaimed Greta Miller, who was
surveying Clyde calmly as though she were debating with herself
whether he was worth-while game or not, and deciding that he was:
"With all the ice-cream and cake and pie and sandwiches we'll have
to eat yet to-night. We was just going to warn Louise not to fill
up too much. Kittie Keane's givin' a birthday party, you know, Tom,
and she'll have a big cake an' everythin'. You're comin' down,
ain't you, afterwards?" she concluded, with a thought of Clyde and
his possible companionship in mind.</p>

<p>"I wasn't thinkin' of it," calmly observed Ratterer. "Me and
Clyde was thinkin' of goin' to a show after dinner."</p>

<p>"Oh, how foolish," put in Hortense Briggs, more to attract
attention to herself and take it away from Greta than anything
else. She was still in front of the mirror, but turned now to cast
a fetching smile on all, particularly Clyde, for whom she fancied
her friend might be angling, "When you could come along and dance.
I call that silly."</p>

<p>"Sure, dancing is all you three ever think of&mdash;you and
Louise," retorted Ratterer. "It's a wonder you don't give
yourselves a rest once in a while. I'm on my feet all day an' I
like to sit down once in a while." He could be most matter-of-fact
at times.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't say sit down to me," commented Greta Miller with a
lofty smile and a gliding, dancing motion of her left foot, "with
all the dates we got ahead of us this week. Oh, gee!" Her eyes and
eyebrows went up and she clasped her hands dramatically before her.
"It's just terrible, all the dancin' we gotta do yet, this winter,
don't we, Hortense? Thursday night and Friday night and Saturday
and Sunday nights." She counted on her fingers most archly. "Oh,
gee! It is terrible, really." She gave Clyde an appealing,
sympathy-seeking smile. "Guess where we were the other night, Tom.
Louise and Ralph Thorpe and Hortense and Bert Gettler, me and
Willie Bassick&mdash;out at Pegrain's on Webster Avenue. Oh, an'
you oughta seen the crowd out there. Sam Shaffer and Tillie Burns
was there. And we danced until four in the morning. I thought my
knees would break. I ain't been so tired in I don't know when."</p>

<p>"Oh, gee!" broke in Hortense, seizing her turn and lifting her
arms dramatically. "I thought I never would get to work the next
morning. I could just barely see the customers moving around. And,
wasn't my mother fussy! Gee! She hasn't gotten over it yet. She
don't mind so much about Saturdays and Sundays, but all these week
nights and when I have to get up the next morning at seven&mdash;
gee&mdash;how she can pick!"</p>

<p>"An' I don't blame her, either," commented Mrs. Ratterer, who
was just then entering with a plate of potatoes and some bread.
"You two'll get sick and Louise, too, if you don't get more rest. I
keep tellin' her she won't be able to keep her place or stand it if
she don't get more sleep. But she don't pay no more attention to me
than Tom does, and that's just none at all."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, you can't expect a fellow in my line to get in early
always, Ma," was all Ratterer said. And Hortense Briggs added:
"Gee, I'd die if I had to stay in one night. You gotta have a
little fun when you work all day."</p>

<p>What an easy household, thought Clyde. How liberal and
indifferent. And the sexy, gay way in which these two girls posed
about. And their parents thought nothing of it, evidently. If only
he could have a girl as pretty as this Hortense Briggs, with her
small, sensuous mouth and her bright hard eyes.</p>

<p>"To bed twice a week early is all I need," announced Greta
Miller archly. "My father thinks I'm crazy, but more'n that would
do me harm." She laughed jestingly, and Clyde, in spite of the "we
was'es" and "I seen's," was most vividly impressed. Here was youth
and geniality and freedom and love of life.</p>

<p>And just then the front door opened and in hurried Louise
Ratterer, a medium-sized, trim, vigorous little girl in a red-lined
cape and a soft blue felt hat pulled over her eyes. Unlike her
brother, she was brisk and vigorous and more lithe and as pretty as
either of these others.</p>

<p>"Oh, look who's here!" she exclaimed. "You two birds beat me
home, didnja? Well, I got stuck to-night on account of some mix-up
in my sales-book. And I had to go up to the cashier's office. You
bet it wasn't my fault, though. They got my writin' wrong," then
noting Clyde for the first time, she announced: "I bet I know who
this is&mdash;Mr. Griffiths. Tom's talked about you a lot. I
wondered why he didn't bring you around here before." And Clyde,
very much flattered, mumbled that he wished he had.</p>

<p>But the two visitors, after conferring with Louise in a small
front bedroom to which they all retired, reappeared presently and
because of strenuous invitations, which were really not needed,
decided to remain. And Clyde, because of their presence, was now
intensely wrought up and alert&mdash;eager to make a pleasing
impression and to be received upon terms of friendship here. And
these three girls, finding him attractive, were anxious to be
agreeable to him, so much so that for the first time in his life
they put him at his ease with the opposite sex and caused him to
find his tongue.</p>

<p>"We was just going to warn you not to eat so much," laughed
Greta Miller, turning to Louise, "and now, see, we are all trying
to eat again." She laughed heartily. "And they'll have pies and
cakes and everythin' at Kittie's."</p>

<p>"Oh, gee, and we're supposed to dance, too, on top of all this.
Well, heaven help me, is all I have to say," put in Hortense.</p>

<p>The peculiar sweetness of her mouth, as he saw it, as well as
the way she crinkled it when she smiled, caused Clyde to be quite
beside himself with admiration and pleasure. She looked quite
delightful&mdash;wonderful to him. Indeed her effect on him made
him swallow quickly and half choke on the coffee he had just taken.
He laughed and felt irrepressibly gay.</p>

<p>At that moment she turned on him and said: "See, what I've done
to him now."</p>

<p>"Oh, that ain't all you've done to me," exclaimed Clyde,
suddenly being seized with an inspiration and a flow of thought and
courage. Of a sudden, because of her effect on him, he felt bold
and courageous, albeit a little foolish and added, "Say, I'm
gettin' kinda woozy with all the pretty faces I see around
here."</p>

<p>"Oh, gee, you don't want to give yourself away that quick around
here, Clyde," cautioned Ratterer, genially. "These high-binders'll
be after you to make you take 'em wherever they want to go. You
better not begin that way." And, sure enough, Louise Ratterer, not
to be abashed by what her brother had just said, observed: "You
dance, don't you, Mr. Griffiths?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't," replied Clyde, suddenly brought back to reality
by this inquiry and regretting most violently the handicap this was
likely to prove in this group. "But you bet I wish I did now," he
added gallantly and almost appealingly, looking first at Hortense
and then at Greta Miller and Louise. But all pretended not to
notice his preference, although Hortense titillated with her
triumph. She was not convinced that she was so greatly taken with
him, but it was something to triumph thus easily and handsomely
over these others. And the others felt it. "Ain't that too bad?"
she commented, a little indifferently and superiorly now that she
realized that she was his preference. "You might come along with
us, you and Tom, if you did. There's goin' to be mostly dancing at
Kittie's."</p>

<p>Clyde began to feel and look crushed at once. To think that this
girl, to whom of all those here he was most drawn, could dismiss
him and his dreams and desires thus easily, and all because he
couldn't dance. And his accursed home training was responsible for
all this. He felt broken and cheated. What a boob he must seem not
to be able to dance. And Louise Ratterer looked a little puzzled
and indifferent, too. But Greta Miller, whom he liked less than
Hortense, came to his rescue with: "Oh, it ain't so hard to learn.
I could show you in a few minutes after dinner if you wanted to.
It's only a few steps you have to know. And then you could go,
anyhow, if you wanted to."</p>

<p>Clyde was grateful and said so&mdash;determined to learn here or
elsewhere at the first opportunity. Why hadn't he gone to a dancing
school before this, he asked himself. But the thing that pained him
most was the seeming indifference of Hortense now that he had made
it clear that he liked her. Perhaps it was that Bert Gettler,
previously mentioned, with whom she had gone to the dance, who was
making it impossible for him to interest her. So he was always to
be a failure this way. Oh, gee!</p>

<p>But the moment the dinner was over and while the others were
still talking, the first to put on a dance record and come over
with hands extended was Hortense, who was determined not to be
outdone by her rival in this way. She was not particularly
interested or fascinated by Clyde, at least not to the extent of
troubling about him as Greta did. But if her friend was going to
attempt a conquest in this manner, was it not just as well to
forestall her? And so, while Clyde misread her change of attitude
to the extent of thinking that she liked him better than he had
thought, she took him by the hands, thinking at the same time that
he was too bashful. However, placing his right arm about her waist,
his other clasped in hers at her shoulder, she directed his
attention to her feet and his and began to illustrate the few
primary movements of the dance. But so eager and grateful was
he&mdash;almost intense and ridiculous&mdash;she did not like him
very much, thought him a little unsophisticated and too young. At
the same time, there was a charm about him which caused her to wish
to assist him. And soon he was moving about with her quite
easily&mdash;and afterwards with Greta and then Louise, but wishing
always it was Hortense. And finally he was pronounced sufficiently
skillful to go, if he would.</p>

<p>And now the thought of being near her, being able to dance with
her again, drew him so greatly that, despite the fact that three
youths, among them that same Bert Gettler, appeared on the scene to
escort them, and although he and Ratterer had previously agreed to
go to a theater together, he could not help showing how much he
would prefer to follow those others&mdash;so much so that Ratterer
finally agreed to abandon the theater idea. And soon they were off,
Clyde grieving that he could not walk with Hortense, who was with
Gettler, and hating his rival because of this; but still attempting
to be civil to Louise and Greta, who bestowed sufficient attention
on him to make him feel at ease. Ratterer, having noticed his
extreme preference and being alone with him for a moment, said:
"You better not get too stuck on that Hortense Briggs. I don't
think she's on the level with anybody. She's got that fellow
Gettler and others. She'll only work you an' you might not get
anything, either."</p>

<p>But Clyde, in spite of this honest and well-meant caution, was
not to be dissuaded. On sight, and because of the witchery of a
smile, the magic and vigor of motion and youth, he was completely
infatuated and would have given or done anything for an additional
smile or glance or hand pressure. And that despite the fact that he
was dealing with a girl who no more knew her own mind than a moth,
and who was just reaching the stage where she was finding it
convenient and profitable to use boys of her own years or a little
older for whatever pleasures or clothes she desired.<br>
<br></p>

<p>The party proved nothing more than one of those ebullitions of
the youthful mating period. The house of Kittie Keane was little
more than a cottage in a poor street under bare December trees. But
to Clyde, because of the passion for a pretty face that was
suddenly lit in him, it had the color and the form and gayety of
romance itself. And the young girls and boys that he met
there&mdash;girls and boys of the Ratterer, Hegglund, Hortense
stripe&mdash;were still of the very substance and texture of that
energy, ease and forwardness which he would have given his soul to
possess. And curiously enough, in spite of a certain nervousness on
his part, he was by reason of his new companions made an integral
part of the gayeties.</p>

<p>And on this occasion he was destined to view a type of girl and
youth in action such as previously it had not been his fortune or
misfortune, as you will, to see. There was, for instance, a type of
sensual dancing which Louise and Hortense and Greta indulged in
with the greatest nonchalance and assurance. At the same time, many
of these youths carried whisky in a hip flask, from which they not
only drank themselves, but gave others to drink&mdash;boys and
girls indiscriminately.</p>

<p>And the general hilarity for this reason being not a little
added to, they fell into more intimate relations&mdash;spooning
with one and another&mdash;Hortense and Louise and Greta included.
Also to quarreling at times. And it appeared to be nothing out of
the ordinary, as Clyde saw, for one youth or another to embrace a
girl behind a door, to hold her on his lap in a chair in some
secluded corner, to lie with her on a sofa, whispering intimate and
unquestionably welcome things to her. And although at no time did
he espy Hortense doing this&mdash;still, as he saw, she did not
hesitate to sit on the laps of various boys or to whisper with
rivals behind doors. And this for a time so discouraged and at the
same time incensed him that he felt he could not and would not have
anything more to do with her&mdash;she was too cheap, vulgar,
inconsiderate.</p>

<p>At the same time, having partaken of the various drinks offered
him&mdash;so as not to seem less worldly wise than the
others&mdash;until brought to a state of courage and daring not
ordinarily characteristic of him, he ventured to half plead with
and at the same time half reproach her for her too lax conduct.</p>

<p>"You're a flirt, you are. You don't care who you jolly, do you?"
This as they were dancing together after one o'clock to the music
of a youth named Wilkens, at the none too toneful piano. She was
attempting to show him a new step in a genial and yet coquettish
way, and with an amused, sensuous look.</p>

<p>"What do you mean, flirt? I don't get you."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't you?" replied Clyde, a little crossly and still
attempting to conceal his real mood by a deceptive smile. "I've
heard about you. You jolly 'em all."</p>

<p>"Oh, do I?" she replied quite irritably. "Well, I haven't tried
to jolly you very much, have I?"</p>

<p>"Well, now, don't get mad," he half pleaded and half scolded,
fearing, perhaps, that he had ventured too far and might lose her
entirely now. "I don't mean anything by it. You don't deny that you
let a lot of these fellows make love to you. They seem to like you,
anyway."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, of course they like me, I guess. I can't help that,
can I?"</p>

<p>"Well, I'll tell you one thing," he blurted boastfully and
passionately. "I could spend a lot more on you than they could. I
got it." He had been thinking only the moment before of fifty-five
dollars in bills that snuggled comfortably in his pocket.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know," she retorted, not a little intrigued by this
cash offer, as it were, and at the same time not a little set up in
her mood by the fact that she could thus inflame nearly all youths
in this way. She was really a little silly, very lightheaded, who
was infatuated by her own charms and looked in every mirror,
admiring her eyes, her hair, her neck, her hands, her figure, and
practising a peculiarly fetching smile.</p>

<p>At the same time, she was not unaffected by the fact that Clyde
was not a little attractive to look upon, although so very green.
She liked to tease such beginners. He was a bit of a fool, as she
saw him. But he was connected with the Green-Davidson, and he was
well-dressed, and no doubt he had all the money he said and would
spend it on her. Some of those whom she liked best did not have
much money to spend.</p>

<p>"Lots of fellows with money would like to spend it on me." She
tossed her head and flicked her eyes and repeated her coyest
smile.</p>

<p>At once Clyde's countenance darkened. The witchery of her look
was too much for him. The skin of his forehead crinkled and then
smoothed out. His eyes burned lustfully and bitterly, his old
resentment of life and deprivation showing. No doubt all she said
was true. There were others who had more and would spend more. He
was boasting and being ridiculous and she was laughing at him.</p>

<p>After a moment, he added, weakly, "I guess that's right, too.
But they couldn't want you more than I do."</p>

<p>The uncalculated honesty of it flattered her not a little. He
wasn't so bad after all. They were gracefully gliding about as the
music continued.</p>

<p>"Oh, well, I don't flirt everywhere like I do here. These
fellows and girls all know each other. We're always going around
together. You mustn't mind what you see here."</p>

<p>She was lying artfully, but it was soothing to him none the
less. "Gee, I'd give anything if you'd only be nice to me," he
pleaded, desperately and yet ecstatically. "I never saw a girl I'd
rather have than you. You're swell. I'm crazy about you. Why won't
you come out to dinner with me and let me take you to a show
afterwards? Don't you want to do that, tomorrow night or Sunday?
Those are my two nights off. I work other nights."</p>

<p>She hesitated at first, for even now she was not so sure that
she wished to continue this contact. There was Gettler, to say
nothing of several others, all jealous and attentive. Even though
he spent money on her, she might not wish to bother with him. He
was already too eager and he might become troublesome. At the same
time, the natural coquetry of her nature would not permit her to
relinquish him. He might fall into the hands of Greta or Louise. In
consequence she finally arranged a meeting for the following
Tuesday. But he could not come to the house, or take her home
to-night&mdash;on account of her escort, Mr. Gettler. But on the
following Tuesday, at six-thirty, near the Green-Davidson. And he
assured her that they would dine first at Frissell's, and then see
"The Corsair," a musical comedy at Libby's, only two blocks
away.</p>

<h3>Chapter 12</h3>

<p>Now trivial as this contact may seem to some, it was of the
utmost significance to Clyde. Up to this time he had never seen a
girl with so much charm who would deign to look at him, or so he
imagined. And now he had found one, and she was pretty and actually
interested sufficiently to accompany him to dinner and to a show.
It was true, perhaps, that she was a flirt, and not really sincere
with any one, and that maybe at first he could not expect her to
center her attentions on him, but who knew&mdash;who could
tell?</p>

<p>And true to her promise on the following Tuesday she met him at
the corner of 14th Street and Wyandotte, near the Green-Davidson.
And so excited and flattered and enraptured was he that he could
scarcely arrange his jumbled thoughts and emotions in any seemly
way. But to show that he was worthy of her, he had made an almost
exotic toilet&mdash;hair pomaded, a butterfly tie, new silk muffler
and silk socks to emphasize his bright brown shoes, purchased
especially for the occasion.</p>

<p>But once he had reencountered Hortense, whether all this was of
any import to her he could not tell. For, after all, it was her own
appearance, not his, that interested her. And what was more&mdash;a
trick with her&mdash;she chose to keep him waiting until nearly
seven o'clock, a delay which brought about in him the deepest
dejection of spirit for the time being. For supposing, after all,
in the interval, she had decided that she did not care for him and
did not wish to see him any more. Well, then he would have to do
without her, of course. But that would prove that he was not
interesting to a girl as pretty as she was, despite all the nice
clothes he was now able to wear and the money he could spend. He
was determined that, girl or no girl, he would not have one who was
not pretty. Ratterer and Hegglund did not seem to mind whether the
girl they knew was attractive or not, but with him it was a
passion. The thought of being content with one not so attractive
almost nauseated him.</p>

<p>And yet here he was now, on the street corner in the
dark&mdash;the flare of many signs and lights about, hundreds of
pedestrians hurrying hither and thither, the thought of pleasurable
intentions and engagements written upon the faces of many&mdash;and
he, he alone, might have to turn and go somewhere else&mdash;eat
alone, go to a theater alone, go home alone, and then to work again
in the morning. He had just about concluded that he was a failure
when out of the crowd, a little distance away, emerged the face and
figure of Hortense. She was smartly dressed in a black velvet
jacket with a reddish-brown collar and cuffs, and a bulgy, round
tam of the same material with a red leather buckle on the side. And
her cheeks and lips were rouged a little. And her eyes sparkled.
And as usual she gave herself all the airs of one very well content
with herself.</p>

<p>"Oh, hello, I'm late, ain't I? I couldn't help it. You see, I
forgot I had another appointment with a fella, a friend of
mine&mdash; gee, a peach of a boy, too, and it was only at six I
remembered that I had the two dates. Well, I was in a mess then. So
I had to do something about one of you. I was just about to call
you up and make a date for another night, only I remembered you
wouldn't be at your place after six. Tom never is. And Charlie
always is in his place till six-thirty, anyhow, sometimes later,
and he's a peach of a fella that way&mdash;never grouchy or
nothing. And he was goin' to take me to the theater and to dinner,
too. He has charge of the cigar stand over here at the Orphia. So I
called him up. Well, he didn't like it so very much. But I told him
I'd make it another night. Now, aintcha glad? Dontcha think I'm
pretty nice to you, disappointin' a good-lookin' fella like Charlie
for you?"</p>

<p>She had caught a glimpse of the disturbed and jealous and yet
fearsome look in Clyde's eyes as she talked of another. And the
thought of making him jealous was a delight to her. She realized
that he was very much smitten with her. So she tossed her head and
smiled, falling into step with him as he moved up the street.</p>

<p>"You bet it was nice of you to come," he forced himself to say,
even though the reference to Charlie as a "peach of a fella" seemed
to affect his throat and his heart at the same time. What chance
had he to hold a girl who was so pretty and self-willed? "Gee, you
look swell to-night," he went on, forcing himself to talk and
surprising himself a little with his ability to do so. "I like the
way that hat looks on you, and your coat too." He looked directly
at her, his eyes lit with admiration, an eager yearning filling
them. He would have liked to have kissed her&mdash;her pretty
mouth&mdash; only he did not dare here, or anywhere as yet.</p>

<p>"I don't wonder you have to turn down engagements. You're pretty
enough. Don't you want some roses to wear?" They were passing a
flower store at the moment and the sight of them put the thought of
the gift in his mind. He had heard Hegglund say that women liked
fellows who did things for them.</p>

<p>"Oh, sure, I would like some roses," she replied, turning into
the place. "Or maybe some of those violets. They look pretty. They
go better with this jacket, I think."</p>

<p>She was pleased to think that Clyde was sporty enough to think
of flowers. Also that he was saying such nice things about her. At
the same time she was convinced that he was a boy who had had
little, if anything, to do with girls. And she preferred youths and
men who were more experienced, not so easily flattered by
her&mdash; not so easy to hold. Yet she could not help thinking
that Clyde was a better type of boy or man than she was accustomed
to&mdash;more refined. And for that reason, in spite of his
gaucheness (in her eyes) she was inclined to tolerate him&mdash;to
see how he would do.</p>

<p>"Well, these are pretty nifty," she exclaimed, picking up a
rather large bouquet of violets and pinning them on. "I think I'll
wear these." And while Clyde paid for them, she posed before the
mirror, adjusting them to her taste. At last, being satisfied as to
their effect, she turned and exclaimed, "Well, I'm ready," and took
him by the arm.</p>

<p>Clyde, being not a little overawed by her spirit and mannerisms,
was at a loss what else to say for the moment, but he need not have
worried&mdash;her chief interest in life was herself.</p>

<p>"Gee, I tell you I had a swift week of it last week. Out every
night until three. An' Sunday until nearly morning. My, that was
some rough party I was to last night, all right. Ever been down to
Burkett's at Gifford's Ferry? Oh, a nifty place, all right, right
over the Big Blue at 39th. Dancing in summer and you can skate
outside when it's frozen in winter or dance on the ice. An' the
niftiest little orchestra."</p>

<p>Clyde watched the play of her mouth and the brightness of her
eyes and the swiftness of her gestures without thinking so much of
what she said&mdash;very little.</p>

<p>"Wallace Trone was along with us&mdash;gee, he's a scream of a
kid&mdash;and afterwards when we was sittin' down to eat ice cream,
he went out in the kitchen and blacked up an' put on a waiter's
apron and coat and then comes back and serves us. That's one funny
boy. An' he did all sorts of funny stuff with the dishes and
spoons." Clyde sighed because he was by no means as gifted as the
gifted Trone.</p>

<p>"An' then, Monday morning, when we all got back it was nearly
four, and I had to get up again at seven. I was all in. I coulda
chucked my job, and I woulda, only for the nice people down at the
store and Mr. Beck. He's the head of my department, you know, and
say, how I do plague that poor man. I sure am hard on that store.
One day I comes in late after lunch; one of the other girls punched
the clock for me with my key, see, and he was out in the hall and
he saw her, and he says to me afterwards, about two in the
afternoon, 'Say look here, Miss Briggs' (he always calls me Miss
Briggs, 'cause I won't let him call me nothing else. He'd try to
get fresh if I did), 'that loanin' that key stuff don't go. Cut
that stuff out now. This ain't no Follies.' I had to laugh. He does
get so sore at times at all of us. But I put him in his place just
the same. He's kinda soft on me, you know&mdash;he wouldn't fire me
for worlds, not him. So I says to him, 'See here, Mr. Beck, you
can't talk to me in any such style as that. I'm not in the habit of
comin' late often. An' wot's more, this ain't the only place I can
work in K.C. If I can't be late once in a while without hearin'
about it, you can just send up for my time, that's all, see.' I
wasn't goin' to let him get away with that stuff. And just as I
thought, he weakened. All he says was, 'Well, just the same, I'm
warnin' you. Next time maybe Mr. Tierney'll see you an' then you'll
get a chance to try some other store, all right.' He knew he was
bluffing and that I did, too. I had to laugh. An' I saw him
laughin' with Mr. Scott about two minutes later. But, gee, I
certainly do pull some raw stuff around there at times."</p>

<p>By then she and Clyde, with scarcely a word on his part, and
much to his ease and relief, had reached Frissell's. And for the
first time in his life he had the satisfaction of escorting a girl
to a table in such a place. Now he really was beginning to have a
few experiences worthy of the name. He was quite on edge with the
romance of it. Because of her very high estimate of herself, her
very emphatic picture of herself as one who was intimate with so
many youths and girls who were having a good time, he felt that up
to this hour he had not lived at all. Swiftly he thought of the
different things she had told him&mdash;Burkett's on the Big Blue,
skating and dancing on the ice&mdash;Charlie Trone&mdash;the young
tobacco clerk with whom she had had the engagement for
to-night&mdash;Mr. Beck at the store who was so struck on her that
he couldn't bring himself to fire her. And as he saw her order
whatever she liked, without any thought of his purse, he
contemplated quickly her face, figure, the shape of her hands, so
suggestive always of the delicacy or roundness of the arm, the
swell of her bust, already very pronounced, the curve of her
eyebrows, the rounded appeal of her smooth cheeks and chin. There
was something also about the tone of her voice, unctuous, smooth,
which somehow appealed to and disturbed him. To him it was
delicious. Gee, if he could only have such a girl all for
himself!</p>

<p>And in here, as without, she clattered on about herself, not at
all impressed, apparently, by the fact that she was dining here, a
place that to him had seemed quite remarkable. When she was not
looking at herself in a mirror, she was studying the bill of fare
and deciding what she liked&mdash;lamb with mint jelly&mdash;no
omelette, no beef&mdash;oh, yes, filet of mignon with mushrooms.
She finally compromised on that with celery and cauliflower. And
she would like a cocktail. Oh, yes, Clyde had heard Hegglund say
that no meal was worth anything without a few drinks, so now he had
mildly suggested a cocktail. And having secured that and a second,
she seemed warmer and gayer and more gossipy than ever.</p>

<p>But all the while, as Clyde noticed, her attitude in so far as
he was concerned was rather distant&mdash;impersonal. If for so
much as a moment, he ventured to veer the conversation ever so
slightly to themselves, his deep personal interest in her, whether
she was really very deeply concerned about any other youth, she
threw him off by announcing that she liked all the boys, really.
They were all so lovely&mdash;so nice to her. They had to be. When
they weren't, she didn't have anything more to do with them. She
"tied a can to them," as she once expressed it. Her quick eyes
clicked and she tossed her head defiantly.</p>

<p>And Clyde was captivated by all this. Her gestures, her poses,
moues and attitudes were sensuous and suggestive. She seemed to
like to tease, promise, lay herself open to certain charges and
conclusions and then to withhold and pretend that there was nothing
to all of this&mdash;that she was very unconscious of anything save
the most reserved thoughts in regard to herself. In the main, Clyde
was thrilled and nourished by this mere proximity to her. It was
torture, and yet a sweet kind of torture. He was full of the most
tantalizing thoughts about how wonderful it would be if only he
were permitted to hold her close, kiss her mouth, bite her, even.
To cover her mouth with his! To smother her with kisses! To crush
and pet her pretty figure! She would look at him at moments with
deliberate, swimming eyes, and he actually felt a little sick and
weak&mdash;almost nauseated. His one dream was that by some
process, either of charm or money, he could make himself
interesting to her.</p>

<p>And yet after going with her to the theater and taking her home
again, he could not see that he had made any noticeable progress.
For throughout the performance of "The Corsair" at Libby's,
Hortense, who, because of her uncertain interest in him was really
interested in the play, talked of nothing but similar shows she had
seen, as well as of actors and actresses and what she thought of
them, and what particular youth had taken her. And Clyde, instead
of leading her in wit and defiance and matching her experiences
with his own, was compelled to content himself with approving of
her.</p>

<p>And all the time she was thinking that she had made another real
conquest. And because she was no longer virtuous, and she was
convinced that he had some little money to spend, and could be made
to spend it on her, she conceived the notion of being sufficiently
agreeable&mdash;nothing more&mdash;to hold him, keep him attentive,
if possible, while at the same time she went her own way, enjoying
herself as much as possible with others and getting Clyde to buy
and do such things for her as might fill gaps&mdash;when she was
not sufficiently or amusingly enough engaged elsewhere.</p>

<h3>Chapter 13</h3>

<p>For a period of four months at least this was exactly the way it
worked out. After meeting her in this fashion, he was devoting not
an inconsiderable portion of his free time to attempting to
interest her to the point where she would take as much interest in
him as she appeared to take in others. At the same time he could
not tell whether she could be made to entertain a singular
affection for any one. Nor could he believe that there was only an
innocent camaraderie involved in all this. Yet she was so enticing
that he was deliriously moved by the thought that if his worst
suspicions were true, she might ultimately favor him. So captivated
was he by this savor of sensuality and varietism that was about
her, the stigmata of desire manifest in her gestures, moods, voice,
the way she dressed, that he could not think of relinquishing
her.</p>

<p>Rather, he foolishly ran after her. And seeing this, she put him
off, at times evaded him, compelled him to content himself with
little more than the crumbs of her company, while at the same time
favoring him with descriptions or pictures of other activities and
contacts which made him feel as though he could no longer endure to
merely trail her in this fashion. It was then he would announce to
himself in anger that he was not going to see her any more. She was
no good to him, really. But on seeing her again, a cold
indifference in everything she said and did, his courage failed him
and he could not think of severing the tie.</p>

<p>She was not at all backward at the same time in speaking of
things that she needed or would like to have&mdash;little things,
at first&mdash;a new powder puff, a lip stick, a box of powder or a
bottle of perfume. Later, and without having yielded anything more
to Clyde than a few elusive and evasive endearments&mdash;intimate
and languorous reclinings in his arms which promised much but
always came to nothing&mdash;she made so bold as to indicate to him
at different times and in different ways, purses, blouses,
slippers, stockings, a hat, which she would like to buy if only she
had the money. And he, in order to hold her favor and properly
ingratiate himself, proceeded to buy them, though at times and
because of some other developments in connection with his family,
it pressed him hard to do so. And yet, as he was beginning to see
toward the end of the fourth month, he was apparently little
farther advanced in her favor than he had been in the beginning. In
short, he was conducting a feverish and almost painful pursuit
without any definite promise of reward.<br>
<br></p>

<p>In the meantime, in so far as his home ties went, the
irritations and the depressions which were almost inextricably
involved with membership in the Griffiths family were not different
from what they had ever been. For, following the disappearance of
Esta, there had settled a period of dejection which still endured.
Only, in so far as Clyde was concerned, it was complicated with a
mystery which was tantalizing and something more&mdash;irritating;
for when it came to anything which related to sex in the Griffiths
family, no parents could possibly have been more squeamish.</p>

<p>And especially did this apply to the mystery which had now
surrounded Esta for some time. She had gone. She had not returned.
And so far as Clyde and the others knew, no word of any kind had
been received from her. However, Clyde had noted that after the
first few weeks of her absence, during which time both his mother
and father had been most intensely wrought up and troubled,
worrying greatly as to her whereabouts and why she did not write,
suddenly they had ceased their worries, and had become very much
more resigned&mdash;at least not so tortured by a situation that
previously had seemed to offer no hope whatsoever. He could not
explain it. It was quite noticeable, and yet nothing was said. And
then one day a little later, Clyde had occasion to note that his
mother was in communication with some one by mail&mdash;something
rare for her. For so few were her social or business connections
that she rarely received or wrote a letter.</p>

<p>One day, however, very shortly after he had connected himself
with the Green-Davidson, he had come in rather earlier than usual
in the afternoon and found his mother bending over a letter which
evidently had just arrived and which appeared to interest her
greatly. Also it seemed to be connected with something which
required concealment. For, on seeing him, she stopped reading at
once, and, flustered and apparently nervous, arose and put the
letter away without commenting in any way upon what she had been
doing. But Clyde for some reason, intuition perhaps, had the
thought that it might be from Esta. He was not sure. And he was too
far away to detect the character of the handwriting. But whatever
it was, his mother said nothing afterwards concerning it. She
looked as though she did not want him to inquire, and so reserved
were their relations that he would not have thought of inquiring.
He merely wondered, and then dismissed it partially, but not
entirely, from his mind.</p>

<p>A month or five weeks after this, and just about the time that
he was becoming comparatively well-schooled in his work at the
Green-Davidson, and was beginning to interest himself in Hortense
Briggs, his mother came to him one afternoon with a very peculiar
proposition for her. Without explaining what it was for, or
indicating directly that now she felt that he might be in a better
position to help her, she called him into the mission hall when he
came in from work and, looking at him rather fixedly and nervously
for her, said: "You wouldn't know, Clyde, would you, how I could
raise a hundred dollars right away?"</p>

<p>Clyde was so astonished that he could scarcely believe his ears,
for only a few weeks before the mere mention of any sum above four
or five dollars in connection with him would have been
preposterous. His mother knew that. Yet here she was asking him and
apparently assuming that he might be able to assist her in this
way. And rightly, for both his clothes and his general air had
indicated a period of better days for him.</p>

<p>At the same time his first thought was, of course, that she had
observed his clothes and goings-on and was convinced that he was
deceiving her about the amount he earned. And in part this was
true, only so changed was Clyde's manner of late, that his mother
had been compelled to take a very different attitude toward him and
was beginning to be not a little dubious as to her further control
over him. Recently, or since he had secured this latest place, for
some reason he had seemed to her to have grown wiser, more assured,
less dubious of himself, inclined to go his own way and keep his
own counsel. And while this had troubled her not a little in one
sense, it rather pleased her in another. For to see Clyde, who had
always seemed because of his sensitiveness and unrest so much of a
problem to her, developing in this very interesting way was
something; though at times, and in view of his very recent finery,
she had been wondering and troubled as to the nature of the company
he might be keeping. But since his hours were so long and so
absorbing, and whatever money he made appeared to be going into
clothes, she felt that she had no real reason to complain. Her one
other thought was that perhaps he was beginning to act a little
selfish&mdash;to think too much of his own comfort&mdash;and yet in
the face of his long deprivations she could not very well begrudge
him any temporary pleasure, either.</p>

<p>Clyde, not being sure of her real attitude, merely looked at her
and exclaimed: "Why, where would I get a hundred dollars, Ma?" He
had visions of his new-found source of wealth being dissipated by
such unheard of and inexplicable demands as this, and distress and
distrust at once showed on his countenance.</p>

<p>"I didn't expect that you could get it all for me," Mrs.
Griffiths suggested tactfully. "I have a plan to raise the most of
it, I think. But I did want you to help me try to think how I would
raise the rest. I didn't want to go to your father with this if I
could help it, and you're getting old enough now to be of some
help." She looked at Clyde approvingly and interestedly enough.
"Your father is such a poor hand at business," she went on, "and he
gets so worried at times."</p>

<p>She passed a large and weary hand over her face and Clyde was
moved by her predicament, whatever it was. At the same time, apart
from whether he was willing to part with so much or not, or had it
to give, he was decidedly curious about what all this was for. A
hundred dollars! Gee whiz!</p>

<p>After a moment or two, his mother added: "I'll tell you what
I've been thinking. I must have a hundred dollars, but I can't tell
you for what now, you nor any one, and you mustn't ask me. There's
an old gold watch of your father's in my desk and a solid gold ring
and pin of mine. Those things ought to be worth twenty-five dollars
at least, if they were sold or pawned. Then there is that set of
solid silver knives and forks and that silver platter and pitcher
in there"&mdash;Clyde knew the keepsakes well&mdash;"that platter
alone is worth twenty-five dollars. I believe they ought to bring
at least twenty or twenty-five together. I was thinking if I could
get you to go to some good pawnshop with them down near where you
work, and then if you would let me have five more a week for a
while" (Clyde's countenance fell)&mdash;"I could get a friend of
mine&mdash; Mr. Murch who comes here, you know&mdash;to advance me
enough to make up the hundred, and then I could pay him back out of
what you pay me. I have about ten dollars myself."</p>

<p>She looked at Clyde as much as to say: "Now, surely, you won't
desert me in my hour of trouble," and Clyde relaxed, in spite of
the fact that he had been counting upon using quite all that he
earned for himself. In fact, he agreed to take the trinkets to the
pawnshop, and to advance her five more for the time being until the
difference between whatever the trinkets brought and one hundred
dollars was made up. And yet in spite of himself, he could not help
resenting this extra strain, for it had only been a very short time
that he had been earning so much. And here was his mother demanding
more and more, as he saw it&mdash;ten dollars a week now. Always
something wrong, thought Clyde, always something needed, and with
no assurance that there would not be more such demands later.</p>

<p>He took the trinkets, carried them to the most presentable
pawnshop he could find, and being offered forty-five dollars for
the lot, took it. This, with his mother's ten, would make
fifty-five, and with forty-five she could borrow from Mr. Murch,
would make a hundred. Only now, as he saw, it would mean that for
nine weeks he would have to give her ten dollars instead of five.
And that, in view of his present aspirations to dress, live and
enjoy himself in a way entirely different from what he previously
considered necessary, was by no means a pleasure to contemplate.
Nevertheless he decided to do it. After all he owed his mother
something. She had made many sacrifices for him and the others in
days past and he could not afford to be too selfish. It was not
decent.</p>

<p>But the most enduring thought that now came to him was that if
his mother and father were going to look to him for financial aid,
they should be willing to show him more consideration than had
previously been shown him. For one thing he ought to be allowed to
come and go with more freedom, in so far as his night hours were
concerned. And at the same time he was clothing himself and eating
his meals at the hotel, and that was no small item, as he saw
it.</p>

<p>However, there was another problem that had soon arisen and it
was this. Not so long after the matter of the hundred dollars, he
encountered his mother in Montrose Street, one of the poorest
streets which ran north from Bickel, and which consisted entirely
of two unbroken lines of wooden houses and two-story flats and many
unfurnished apartments. Even the Griffiths, poor as they were,
would have felt themselves demeaned by the thought of having to
dwell in such a street. His mother was coming down the front steps
of one of the less tatterdemalion houses of this row, a lower front
window of which carried a very conspicuous card which read
"Furnished Rooms." And then, without turning or seeing Clyde across
the street, she proceeded to another house a few doors away, which
also carried a furnished rooms card and, after surveying the
exterior interestedly, mounted the steps and rang the bell.</p>

<p>Clyde's first impression was that she was seeking the
whereabouts of some individual in whom she was interested and of
whose address she was not certain. But crossing over to her at
about the moment the proprietress of the house put her head out of
the door, he heard his mother say: "You have a room for rent?"
"Yes." "Has it a bath?" "No, but there's a bath on the second
floor." "How much is it a week?" "Four dollars." "Could I see it?"
"Yes, just step in."</p>

<p>Mrs. Griffiths appeared to hesitate while Clyde stood below, not
twenty-five feet away, and looked up at her, waiting for her to
turn and recognize him. But she stepped in without turning. And
Clyde gazed after her curiously, for while it was by no means
inconceivable that his mother might be looking for a room for some
one, yet why should she be looking for it in this street when as a
rule she usually dealt with the Salvation Army or the Young Women's
Christian Association. His first impulse was to wait and inquire of
her what she was doing here, but being interested in several
errands of his own, he went on.</p>

<p>That night, returning to his own home to dress and seeing his
mother in the kitchen, he said to her: "I saw you this morning, Ma,
in Montrose Street."</p>

<p>"Yes," his mother replied, after a moment, but not before he had
noticed that she had started suddenly as though taken aback by this
information. She was paring potatoes and looked at him curiously.
"Well, what of it?" she added, calmly, but flushing just the
same&mdash; a thing decidedly unusual in connection with her where
he was concerned. Indeed, that start of surprise interested and
arrested Clyde.</p>

<p>"You were going into a house there&mdash;looking for a furnished
room, I guess."</p>

<p>"Yes, I was," replied Mrs. Griffiths, simply enough now. "I need
a room for some one who is sick and hasn't much money, but it's not
so easy to find either." She turned away as though she were not
disposed to discuss this any more, and Clyde, while sensing her
mood, apparently, could not resist adding: "Gee, that's not much of
a street to have a room in." His new work at the Green-Davidson had
already caused him to think differently of how one should
live&mdash; any one. She did not answer him and he went to his room
to change his clothes.</p>

<p>A month or so after this, coming east on Missouri Avenue late
one evening, he again saw his mother in the near distance coming
west. In the light of one of the small stores which ranged in a row
on this street, he saw that she was carrying a rather heavy
old-fashioned bag, which had long been about the house but had
never been much used by any one. On sight of him approaching (as he
afterwards decided) she had stopped suddenly and turned into a
hallway of a three-story brick apartment building, and when he came
up to it, he found the outside door was shut. He opened it, and saw
a flight of steps dimly lit, up which she might have gone. However,
he did not trouble to investigate, for he was uncertain, once he
reached this place, whether she had gone to call on some one or
not, it had all happened so quickly. But waiting at the next
corner, he finally saw her come out again. And then to his
increasing curiosity, she appeared to look cautiously about before
proceeding as before. It was this that caused him to think that she
must have been endeavoring to conceal herself from him. But
why?</p>

<p>His first impulse was to turn and follow her, so interested was
he by her strange movements. But he decided later that if she did
not want him to know what she was doing, perhaps it was best that
he should not. At the same time he was made intensely curious by
this evasive gesture. Why should his mother not wish him to see her
carrying a bag anywhere? Evasion and concealment formed no part of
her real disposition (so different from his own). Almost instantly
his mind proceeded to join this coincidence with the time he had
seen her descending the steps of the rooming house in Montrose
Street, together with the business of the letter he had found her
reading, and the money she had been compelled to raise&mdash;the
hundred dollars. Where could she be going? What was she hiding?</p>

<p>He speculated on all this, but he could not decide whether it
had any definite connection with him or any member of the family
until about a week later, when, passing along Eleventh near
Baltimore, he thought he saw Esta, or at least a girl so much like
her that she would be taken for her anywhere. She had the same
height, and she was moving along as Esta used to walk. Only, now he
thought as he saw her, she looked older. Yet, so quickly had she
come and gone in the mass of people that he had not been able to
make sure. It was only a glance, but on the strength of it, he had
turned and sought to catch up with her, but upon reaching the spot
she was gone. So convinced was he, however, that he had seen her
that he went straight home, and, encountering his mother in the
mission, announced that he was positive he had seen Esta. She must
be back in Kansas City again. He could have sworn to it. He had
seen her near Eleventh and Baltimore, or thought he had. Had his
mother heard anything from her?</p>

<p>And then curiously enough he observed that his mother's manner
was not exactly what he thought it should have been under the
circumstances. His own attitude had been one of commingled
astonishment, pleasure, curiosity and sympathy because of the
sudden disappearance and now sudden reappearance of Esta. Could it
be that his mother had used that hundred dollars to bring her back?
The thought had come to him&mdash;why or from where, he could not
say. He wondered. But if so, why had she not returned to her home,
at least to notify the family of her presence here?</p>

<p>He expected his mother would be as astonished and puzzled as he
was&mdash;quick and curious for details. Instead, she appeared to
him to be obviously confused and taken aback by this information,
as though she was hearing about something that she already knew and
was puzzled as to just what her attitude should be.</p>

<p>"Oh, did you? Where? Just now, you say? At Eleventh and
Baltimore? Well, isn't that strange? I must speak to Asa about
this. It's strange that she wouldn't come here if she is back." Her
eyes, as he saw, instead of looking astonished, looked puzzled,
disturbed. Her mouth, always the case when she was a little
embarrassed and disconcerted, worked oddly&mdash;not only the lips
but the jaw itself.</p>

<p>"Well, well," she added, after a pause. "That is strange.
Perhaps it was just some one who looked like her."</p>

<p>But Clyde, watching her out of the corner of his eye, could not
believe that she was as astonished as she pretended. And,
thereafter, Asa coming in, and Clyde not having as yet departed for
the hotel, he heard them discussing the matter in some strangely
inattentive and unillumined way, as if it was not quite as
startling as it had seemed to him. And for some time he was not
called in to explain what he had seen.</p>

<p>And then, as if purposely to solve this mystery for him, he
encountered his mother one day passing along Spruce Street, this
time carrying a small basket on her arm. She had, as he had noticed
of late, taken to going out regularly mornings and afternoons or
evenings. On this occasion, and long before she had had an
opportunity to see him, he had discerned her peculiarly heavy
figure draped in the old brown coat which she always wore, and had
turned into Myrkel Street and waited for her to pass, a convenient
news stand offering him shelter. Once she had passed, he dropped
behind her, allowing her to precede him by half a block. And at
Dalrymple, she crossed to Beaudry, which was really a continuation
of Spruce, but not so ugly. The houses were quite old&mdash;quondam
residences of an earlier day, but now turned into boarding and
rooming houses. Into one of these he saw her enter and disappear,
but before doing so she looked inquiringly about her.</p>

<p>After she had entered, Clyde approached the house and studied it
with great interest. What was his mother doing in there? Who was it
she was going to see? He could scarcely have explained his intense
curiosity to himself, and yet, since having thought that he had
seen Esta on the street, he had an unconvinced feeling that it
might have something to do with her. There were the letters, the
one hundred dollars, the furnished room in Montrose Street.</p>

<p>Diagonally across the way from the house in Beaudry Street there
was a large-trunked tree, leafless now in the winter wind, and near
it a telegraph pole, close enough to make a joint shadow with it.
And behind these he was able to stand unseen, and from this vantage
point to observe the several windows, side and front and ground and
second floor. Through one of the front windows above, he saw his
mother moving about as though she were quite at home there. And a
moment later, to his astonishment he saw Esta come to one of their
two windows and put a package down on the sill. She appeared to
have on only a light dressing gown or a wrap drawn about her
shoulders. He was not mistaken this time. He actually started as he
realized that it was she, also that his mother was in there with
her. And yet what had she done that she must come back and hide
away in this manner? Had her husband, the man she had run away
with, deserted her?</p>

<p>He was so intensely curious that he decided to wait a while
outside here to see if his mother might not come out, and then he
himself would call on Esta. He wanted so much to see her
again&mdash;to know what this mystery was all about. He waited,
thinking how he had always liked Esta and how strange it was that
she should be here, hiding away in this mysterious way.</p>

<p>After an hour, his mother came out, her basket apparently empty,
for she held it lightly in her hand. And just as before, she looked
cautiously about her, her face wearing that same stolid and yet
care-stamped expression which it always wore these days&mdash;a
cross between an uplifting faith and a troublesome doubt.</p>

<p>Clyde watched her as she proceeded to walk south on Beaudry
Street toward the Mission. After she was well out of sight, he
turned and entered the house. Inside, as he had surmised, he found
a collection of furnished rooms, name plates some of which bore the
names of the roomers pasted upon them. Since he knew that the
southeast front room upstairs contained Esta, he proceeded there
and knocked. And true enough, a light footstep responded within,
and presently, after some little delay which seemed to suggest some
quick preparation within, the door opened slightly and Esta peeped
out&mdash;quizzically at first, then with a little cry of
astonishment and some confusion. For, as inquiry and caution
disappeared, she realized that she was looking at Clyde. At once
she opened the door wide.</p>

<p>"Why, Clyde," she called. "How did you come to find me? I was
just thinking of you."</p>

<p>Clyde at once put his arms around her and kissed her. At the
same time he realized, and with a slight sense of shock and
dissatisfaction, that she was considerably changed. She was
thinner&mdash;paler&mdash;her eyes almost sunken, and not any
better dressed than when he had seen her last. She appeared nervous
and depressed. One of the first thoughts that came to him now was
where her husband was. Why wasn't he here? What had become of him?
As he looked about and at her, he noticed that Esta's look was one
of confusion and uncertainty, not unmixed with a little
satisfaction at seeing him. Her mouth was partly open because of a
desire to smile and to welcome him, but her eyes showed that she
was contending with a problem.</p>

<p>"I didn't expect you here," she added, quickly, the moment he
released her. "You didn't see&mdash;" Then she paused, catching
herself at the brink of some information which evidently she didn't
wish to impart.</p>

<p>"Yes, I did, too&mdash;I saw Ma," he replied. "That's how I came
to know you were here. I saw her coming out just now and I saw you
up here through the window." (He did not care to confess that he
had been following and watching his mother for an hour.) "But when
did you get back?" he went on. "It's a wonder you wouldn't let the
rest of us know something about you. Gee, you're a dandy, you
are&mdash; going away and staying months and never letting any one
of us know anything. You might have written me a little something,
anyhow. We always got along pretty well, didn't we?"</p>

<p>His glance was quizzical, curious, imperative. She, for her
part, felt recessive and thence evasive&mdash;uncertain, quite,
what to think or say or tell.</p>

<p>She uttered: "I couldn't think who it might be. No one comes
here. But, my, how nice you look, Clyde. You've got such nice
clothes, now. And you're getting taller. Mamma was telling me you
are working at the Green-Davidson."</p>

<p>She looked at him admiringly and he was properly impressed by
her notice of him. At the same time he could not get his mind off
her condition. He could not cease looking at her face, her eyes,
her thin-fat body. And as he looked at her waist and her gaunt
face, he came to a very keen realization that all was not well with
her. She was going to have a child. And hence the thought recurred
to him&mdash;where was her husband&mdash;or at any rate, the man
she had eloped with. Her original note, according to her mother,
had said that she was going to get married. Yet now he sensed quite
clearly that she was not married. She was deserted, left in this
miserable room here alone. He saw it, felt it, understood it.</p>

<p>And he thought at once that this was typical of all that seemed
to occur in his family. Here he was just getting a start, trying to
be somebody and get along in the world and have a good time. And
here was Esta, after her first venture in the direction of doing
something for herself, coming to such a finish as this. It made him
a little sick and resentful.</p>

<p>"How long have you been back, Esta?" he repeated dubiously,
scarcely knowing just what to say now, for now that he was here and
she was as she was he began to scent expense, trouble, distress and
to wish almost that he had not been so curious. Why need he have
been? It could only mean that he must help.</p>

<p>"Oh, not so very long, Clyde. About a month, now, I guess. Not
more than that."</p>

<p>"I thought so. I saw you up on Eleventh near Baltimore about a
month ago, didn't I? Sure I did," he added a little less
joyously&mdash; a change that Esta noted. At the same time she
nodded her head affirmatively. "I knew I did. I told Ma so at the
time, but she didn't seem to think so. She wasn't as surprised as I
thought she would be, though. I know why, now. She acted as though
she didn't want me to tell her about it either. But I knew I wasn't
wrong." He stared at Esta oddly, quite proud of his prescience in
this case. He paused though, not knowing quite what else to say and
wondering whether what he had just said was of any sense or import.
It didn't seem to suggest any real aid for her.</p>

<p>And she, not quite knowing how to pass over the nature of her
condition, or to confess it, either, was puzzled what to say.
Something had to be done. For Clyde could see for himself that her
predicament was dreadful. She could scarcely bear the look of his
inquiring eyes. And more to extricate herself than her mother, she
finally observed, "Poor Mamma. You mustn't think it strange of her,
Clyde. She doesn't know what to do, you see, really. It's all my
fault, of course. If I hadn't run away, I wouldn't have caused her
all this trouble. She has so little to do with and she's always had
such a hard time." She turned her back to him suddenly, and her
shoulders began to tremble and her sides to heave. She put her
hands to her face and bent her head low&mdash;and then he knew that
she was silently crying.</p>

<p>"Oh, come now, sis," exclaimed Clyde, drawing near to her
instantly and feeling intensely sorry for her at the moment.
"What's the matter? What do you want to cry for? Didn't that man
that you went away with marry you?"</p>

<p>She shook her head negatively and sobbed the more. And in that
instant there came to Clyde the real psychological as well as
sociological and biological import of his sister's condition. She
was in trouble, pregnant&mdash;and with no money and no husband.
That was why his mother had been looking for a room. That was why
she had tried to borrow a hundred dollars from him. She was ashamed
of Esta and her condition. She was ashamed of not only what people
outside the family would think, but of what he and Julia and Frank
might think&mdash;the effect of Esta's condition upon them
perhaps&mdash; because it was not right, unmoral, as people saw it.
And for that reason she had been trying to conceal it, telling
stories about it&mdash; a most amazing and difficult thing for her,
no doubt. And yet, because of poor luck, she hadn't succeeded very
well.</p>

<p>And now he was again confused and puzzled, not only by his
sister's condition and what it meant to him and the other members
of the family here in Kansas City, but also by his mother's
disturbed and somewhat unmoral attitude in regard to deception in
this instance. She had evaded if not actually deceived him in
regard to all this, for she knew Esta was here all the time. At the
same time he was not inclined to be too unsympathetic in that
respect toward her&mdash; far from it. For such deception in such
an instance had to be, no doubt, even where people were as
religious and truthful as his mother, or so he thought. You
couldn't just let people know. He certainly wouldn't want to let
people know about Esta, if he could help it. What would they think?
What would they say about her and him? Wasn't the general state of
his family low enough, as it was? And so, now he stood, staring and
puzzled the while Esta cried. And she realizing that he was puzzled
and ashamed, because of her, cried the more.</p>

<p>"Gee, that is tough," said Clyde, troubled, and yet fairly
sympathetic after a time. "You wouldn't have run away with him
unless you cared for him though&mdash;would you?" (He was thinking
of himself and Hortense Briggs.) "I'm sorry for you, Ess. Sure, I
am, but it won't do you any good to cry about it now, will it?
There's lots of other fellows in the world beside him. You'll come
out of it all right."</p>

<p>"Oh, I know," sobbed Esta, "but I've been so foolish. And I've
had such a hard time. And now I've brought all this trouble on
Mamma and all of you." She choked and hushed a moment. "He went off
and left me in a hotel in Pittsburgh without any money," she added.
"And if it hadn't been for Mamma, I don't know what I would have
done. She sent me a hundred dollars when I wrote her. I worked for
a while in a restaurant&mdash;as long as I could. I didn't want to
write home and say that he had left me. I was ashamed to. But I
didn't know what else to do there toward the last, when I began
feeling so bad."</p>

<p>She began to cry again; and Clyde, realizing all that his mother
had done and sought to do to assist her, felt almost as sorry now
for his mother as he did for Esta&mdash;more so, for Esta had her
mother to look after her and his mother had almost no one to help
her.</p>

<p>"I can't work yet, because I won't be able to for a while," she
went on. "And Mamma doesn't want me to come home now because she
doesn't want Julia or Frank or you to know. And that's right, too,
I know. Of course it is. And she hasn't got anything and I haven't.
And I get so lonely here, sometimes." Her eyes filled and she began
to choke again. "And I've been so foolish."</p>

<p>And Clyde felt for the moment as though he could cry too. For
life was so strange, so hard at times. See how it had treated him
all these years. He had had nothing until recently and always
wanted to run away. But Esta had done so, and see what had befallen
her. And somehow he recalled her between the tall walls of the big
buildings here in the business district, sitting at his father's
little street organ and singing and looking so innocent and good.
Gee, life was tough. What a rough world it was anyhow. How queer
things went!</p>

<p>He looked at her and the room, and finally, telling her that she
wouldn't be left alone, and that he would come again, only she
mustn't tell his mother he had been there, and that if she needed
anything she could call on him although he wasn't making so very
much, either&mdash;and then went out. And then, walking toward the
hotel to go to work, he kept dwelling on the thought of how
miserable it all was&mdash;how sorry he was that he had followed
his mother, for then he might not have known. But even so, it would
have come out. His mother could not have concealed it from him
indefinitely. She would have asked for more money eventually maybe.
But what a dog that man was to go off and leave his sister in a big
strange city without a dime. He puzzled, thinking now of the girl
who had been deserted in the Green-Davidson some months before with
a room and board bill unpaid. And how comic it had seemed to him
and the other boys at the time&mdash;highly colored with a sensual
interest in it.</p>

<p>But this, well, this was his own sister. A man had thought so
little of his sister as that. And yet, try as he would, he could no
longer think that it was as terrible as when he heard her crying in
the room. Here was this brisk, bright city about him running with
people and effort, and this gay hotel in which he worked. That was
not so bad. Besides there was his own love affair, Hortense, and
pleasures. There must be some way out for Esta. She would get well
again and be all right. But to think of his being part of a family
that was always so poor and so little thought of that things like
this could happen to it&mdash;one thing and another&mdash; like
street preaching, not being able to pay the rent at times, his
father selling rugs and clocks for a living on the
streets&mdash;Esta running away and coming to an end like this.
Gee!</p>

<h3>Chapter 14</h3>

<p>The result of all this on Clyde was to cause him to think more
specifically on the problem of the sexes than he ever had before,
and by no means in any orthodox way. For while he condemned his
sister's lover for thus ruthlessly deserting her, still he was not
willing to hold her entirely blameless by any means. She had gone
off with him. As he now learned from her, he had been in the city
for a week the year before she ran away with him, and it was then
that he had introduced himself to her. The following year when he
returned for two weeks, it was she who looked him up, or so Clyde
suspected, at any rate. And in view of his own interest in and mood
regarding Hortense Briggs, it was not for him to say that there was
anything wrong with the sex relation in itself.</p>

<p>Rather, as he saw it now, the difficulty lay, not in the deed
itself, but in the consequences which followed upon not thinking or
not knowing. For had Esta known more of the man in whom she was
interested, more of what such a relationship with him meant, she
would not be in her present pathetic plight. Certainly such girls
as Hortense Briggs, Greta and Louise, would never have allowed
themselves to be put in any such position as Esta. Or would they?
They were too shrewd. And by contrast with them in his mind, at
least at this time, she suffered. She ought, as he saw it, to have
been able to manage better. And so, by degrees, his attitude toward
her hardened in some measure, though his feeling was not one of
indifference either.</p>

<p>But the one influence that was affecting and troubling and
changing him now was his infatuation for Hortense Briggs&mdash;than
which no more agitating influence could have come to a youth of his
years and temperament. She seemed, after his few contacts with her,
to be really the perfect realization of all that he had previously
wished for in a girl. She was so bright, vain, engaging, and so
truly pretty. Her eyes, as they seemed to him, had a kind of
dancing fire in them. She had a most entrancing way of pursing and
parting her lips and at the same time looking straightly and
indifferently before her, as though she were not thinking of him,
which to him was both flame and fever. It caused him, actually, to
feel weak and dizzy, at times, cruelly seared in his veins with
minute and wriggling threads of fire, and this could only be
described as conscious lust, a torturesome and yet unescapable
thing which yet in her case he was unable to prosecute beyond
embracing and kissing, a form of reserve and respect in regard to
her which she really resented in the very youths in whom she sought
to inspire it. The type of boy for whom she really cared and was
always seeking was one who could sweep away all such
psuedo-ingenuousness and superiorities in her and force her, even
against herself, to yield to him.</p>

<p>In fact she was constantly wavering between actual like and
dislike of him. And in consequence, he was in constant doubt as to
where he stood, a state which was very much relished by her and yet
which was never permitted to become so fixed in his mind as to
cause him to give her up entirely. After some party or dinner or
theater to which she had permitted him to take her, and throughout
which he had been particularly tactful&mdash;not too
assertive&mdash;she could be as yielding and enticing in her mood
as the most ambitious lover would have liked. And this might last
until the evening was nearly over, when suddenly, and at her own
door or the room or house of some girl with whom she was spending
the night, she would turn, and without rhyme or reason, endeavor to
dismiss him with a mere handclasp or a thinly flavored embrace or
kiss. At such times, if Clyde was foolish enough to endeavor to
force her to yield the favors he craved, she would turn on him with
the fury of a spiteful cat, would tear herself away, developing for
the moment, seemingly, an intense mood of opposition which she
could scarcely have explained to herself. Its chief mental content
appeared to be one of opposition to being compelled by him to do
anything. And, because of his infatuation and his weak overtures
due to his inordinate fear of losing her, he would be forced to
depart, usually in a dark and despondent mood.</p>

<p>But so keen was her attraction for him that he could not long
remain away, but must be going about to where most likely he would
encounter her. Indeed, for the most part these days, and in spite
of the peculiar climax which had eventuated in connection with
Esta, he lived in a keen, sweet and sensual dream in regard to her.
If only she would really come to care for him. At night, in his bed
at home, he would lie and think of her&mdash;her face&mdash;the
expressions of her mouth and eyes, the lines of her figure, the
motions of her body in walking or dancing&mdash;and she would
flicker before him as upon a screen. In his dreams, he found her
deliciously near him, pressing against him&mdash;her delightful
body all his&mdash;and then in the moment of crisis, when seemingly
she was about to yield herself to him completely, he would awake to
find her vanished&mdash;an illusion only.</p>

<p>Yet there were several things in connection with her which
seemed to bode success for him. In the first place, like himself,
she was part of a poor family&mdash;the daughter of a machinist and
his wife, who up to this very time had achieved little more than a
bare living. From her childhood she had had nothing, only such
gew-gaws and fripperies as she could secure for herself by her
wits. And so low had been her social state until very recently that
she had not been able to come in contact with anything better than
butcher and baker boys&mdash;the rather commonplace urchins and
small job aspirants of her vicinity. Yet even here she had early
realized that she could and should capitalize her looks and
charm&mdash;and had. Not a few of these had even gone so far as to
steal in order to get money to entertain her.</p>

<p>After reaching the age where she was old enough to go to work,
and thus coming in contact with the type of boy and man in whom she
was now interested, she was beginning to see that without yielding
herself too much, but in acting discreetly, she could win a more
interesting equipment than she had before. Only, so truly sensual
and pleasure-loving was she that she was by no means always willing
to divorce her self-advantages from her pleasures. On the contrary,
she was often troubled by a desire to like those whom she sought to
use, and per contra, not to obligate herself to those whom she
could not like.</p>

<p>In Clyde's case, liking him but a little, she still could not
resist the desire to use him. She liked his willingness to buy her
any little thing in which she appeared interested&mdash;a bag, a
scarf, a purse, a pair of gloves&mdash;anything that she could
reasonably ask or take without obligating herself too much. And yet
from the first, in her smart, tricky way, she realized that unless
she could bring herself to yield to him&mdash;at some time or other
offer him the definite reward which she knew he craved&mdash;she
could not hold him indefinitely.</p>

<p>One thought that stirred her more than anything else was that
the way Clyde appeared to be willing to spend his money on her she
might easily get some quite expensive things from him&mdash;a
pretty and rather expensive dress, perhaps, or a hat, or even a fur
coat such as was then being shown and worn in the city, to say
nothing of gold earrings, or a wrist watch, all of which she was
constantly and enviously eyeing in the different shop windows.</p>

<p>One day not so long after Clyde's discovery of his sister Esta,
Hortense, walking along Baltimore Street near its junction with
Fifteenth&mdash;the smartest portion of the shopping section of the
city&mdash;at the noon hour&mdash;with Doris Trine, another shop
girl in her department store, saw in the window of one of the
smaller and less exclusive fur stores of the city, a fur jacket of
beaver that to her, viewed from the eye-point of her own particular
build, coloring and temperament, was exactly what she needed to
strengthen mightily her very limited personal wardrobe. It was not
such an expensive coat, worth possibly a hundred dollars&mdash;but
fashioned in such an individual way as to cause her to imagine
that, once invested with it, her own physical charm would register
more than it ever had.</p>

<p>Moved by this thought, she paused and exclaimed: "Oh, isn't that
just the classiest, darlingest little coat you ever saw! Oh, do
look at those sleeves, Doris." She clutched her companion violently
by the arm. "Lookit the collar. And the lining! And those pockets!
Oh, dear!" She fairly vibrated with the intensity of her approval
and delight. "Oh, isn't that just too sweet for words? And the very
kind of coat I've been thinking of since I don't know when. Oh, you
pity sing!" she exclaimed, affectedly, thinking all at once as much
of her own pose before the window and its effect on the passer-by
as of the coat before her. "Oh, if I could only have 'oo."</p>

<p>She clapped her hands admiringly, while Isadore Rubenstein, the
elderly son of the proprietor, who was standing somewhat out of the
range of her gaze at the moment, noted the gesture and her
enthusiasm and decided forthwith that the coat must be worth at
least twenty-five or fifty dollars more to her, anyhow, in case she
inquired for it. The firm had been offering it at one hundred. "Oh,
ha!" he grunted. But being of a sensual and somewhat romantic turn,
he also speculated to himself rather definitely as to the probable
trading value, affectionally speaking, of such a coat. What, say,
would the poverty and vanity of such a pretty girl as this cause
her to yield for such a coat?</p>

<p>In the meantime, however, Hortense, having gloated as long as
her noontime hour would permit, had gone away, still dreaming and
satiating her flaming vanity by thinking of how devastating she
would look in such a coat. But she had not stopped to ask the
price. Hence, the next day, feeling that she must look at it once
more, she returned, only this time alone, and yet with no idea of
being able to purchase it herself. On the contrary, she was only
vaguely revolving the problem of how, assuming that the coat was
sufficiently low in price, she could get it. At the moment she
could think of no one. But seeing the coat once more, and also
seeing Mr. Rubenstein, Jr., inside eyeing her in a most
propitiatory and genial manner, she finally ventured in.</p>

<p>"You like the coat, eh?" was Rubenstein's ingratiating comment
as she opened the door. "Well, that shows you have good taste, I'll
say. That's one of the nobbiest little coats we've ever had to show
in this store yet. A real beauty, that. And how it would look on
such a beautiful girl as you!" He took it out of the window and
held it up. "I seen you when you was looking at it yesterday." A
gleam of greedy admiration was in his eye.</p>

<p>And noting this, and feeling that a remote and yet not wholly
unfriendly air would win her more consideration and courtesy than a
more intimate one, Hortense merely said, "Yes?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed. And I said right away, there's a girl that knows a
really swell coat when she sees it."</p>

<p>The flattering unction soothed, in spite of herself.</p>

<p>"Look at that! Look at that!" went on Mr. Rubinstein, turning
the coat about and holding it before her. "Where in Kansas City
will you find anything to equal that today? Look at this silk
lining here&mdash;genuine Mallinson silk&mdash;and these slant
pockets. And the buttons. You think those things don't make a
different-looking coat? There ain't another one like it in Kansas
City today&mdash;not one. And there won't be. We designed it
ourselves and we never repeat our models. We protect our customers.
But come back here." (He led the way to a triple mirror at the
back.) "It takes the right person to wear a coat like this&mdash;to
get the best effect out of it. Let me try it on you."</p>

<p>And by the artificial light Hortense was now privileged to see
how really fetching she did look in it. She cocked her head and
twisted and turned and buried one small ear in the fur, while Mr.
Rubenstein stood by, eyeing her with not a little admiration and
almost rubbing his hands.</p>

<p>"There now," he continued. "Look at that. What do you say to
that, eh? Didn't I tell you it was the very thing for you? A find
for you. A pick-up. You'll never get another coat like that in this
city. If you do, I'll make you a present of this one." He came very
near, extending his plump hands, palms up.</p>

<p>"Well, I must say it does look smart on me," commented Hortense,
her vainglorious soul yearning for it. "I can wear anything like
this, though." She twisted and turned the more, forgetting him
entirely and the effect her interest would have on his cost price.
Then she added: "How much is it?"</p>

<p>"Well, it's really a two-hundred-dollar coat," began Mr.
Rubenstein artfully. Then noting a shadow of relinquishment pass
swiftly over Hortense's face, he added quickly: "That sounds like a
lot of money, but of course we don't ask so much for it down here.
One hundred and fifty is our price. But if that coat was at
Jarek's, that's what you'd pay for it and more. We haven't got the
location here and we don't have to pay the high rents. But it's
worth every cent of two hundred."</p>

<p>"Why, I think that's a terrible price to ask for it, just
awful," exclaimed Hortense sadly, beginning to remove the coat. She
was feeling as though life were depriving her of nearly all that
was worth while. "Why, at Biggs and Beck's they have lots of
three-quarter mink and beaver coats for that much, and classy
styles, too."</p>

<p>"Maybe, maybe. But not that coat," insisted Mr. Rubenstein
stubbornly. "Just look at it again. Look at the collar. You mean to
say you can find a coat like that up there? If you can, I'll buy
the coat for you and sell it to you again for a hundred dollars.
Actually, this is a special coat. It's copied from one of the
smartest coats that was in New York last summer before the season
opened. It has class. You won't find no coat like this coat."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, just the same, a hundred and fifty dollars is more
than I can pay," commented Hortense dolefully, at the same time
slipping on her old broadcloth jacket with the fur collar and
cuffs, and edging toward the door.</p>

<p>"Wait! You like the coat?" wisely observed Mr. Rubenstein, after
deciding that even a hundred dollars was too much for her purse,
unless it could be supplemented by some man's. "It's really a
two-hundred-dollar coat. I'm telling you that straight. Our regular
price is one hundred and fifty. But if you could bring me a hundred
and twenty-five dollars, since you want it so much, well, I'll let
you have it for that. And that's like finding it. A
stunning-looking girl like you oughtn't to have no trouble in
finding a dozen fellows who would be glad to buy that coat and give
it to you. I know I would, if I thought you would be nice to
me."</p>

<p>He beamed ingratiatingly up at her, and Hortense, sensing the
nature of the overture and resenting it&mdash;from him&mdash;drew
back slightly. At the same time she was not wholly displeased by
the compliment involved. But she was not coarse enough, as yet, to
feel that just any one should be allowed to give her anything.
Indeed not. It must be some one she liked, or at least some one
that was enslaved by her.</p>

<p>And yet, even as Mr. Rubenstein spoke, and for some time
afterwards, her mind began running upon possible individuals&mdash;
favorites&mdash;who, by the necromancy of her charm for them, might
be induced to procure this coat for her. Charlie Wilkens for
instance&mdash;he of the Orphia cigar store&mdash;who was most
certainly devoted to her after his fashion, but a fashion, however,
which did not suggest that he might do much for her without getting
a good deal in return.</p>

<p>And then there was Robert Kain, another youth&mdash;very tall,
very cheerful and very ambitious in regard to her, who was
connected with one of the local electric company's branch offices,
but his position was not sufficiently lucrative&mdash;a mere entry
clerk. Also he was too saving&mdash;always talking about his
future.</p>

<p>And again, there was Bert Gettler, the youth who had escorted
her to the dance the night Clyde first met her, but who was little
more than a giddy-headed dancing soul, one not to be relied upon in
a crisis like this. He was only a shoe salesman, probably twenty
dollars a week, and most careful with his pennies.</p>

<p>But there was Clyde Griffiths, the person who seemed to have
real money and to be willing to spend it on her freely. So ran her
thoughts swiftly at the time. But could she now, she asked herself,
offhand, inveigle him into making such an expensive present as
this? She had not favored him so very much&mdash;had for the most
part treated him indifferently. Hence she was not sure, by any
means. Nevertheless as she stood there, debating the cost and the
beauty of the coat, the thought of Clyde kept running through her
mind. And all the while Mr. Rubenstein stood looking at her,
vaguely sensing, after his fashion, the nature of the problem that
was confronting her.</p>

<p>"Well, little girl," he finally observed, "I see you'd like to
have this coat, all right, and I'd like to have you have it, too.
And now I'll tell you what I'll do, and better than that I can't
do, and wouldn't for nobody else&mdash;not a person in this city.
Bring me a hundred and fifteen dollars any time within the next few
days&mdash; Monday or Wednesday or Friday, if the coat is still
here, and you can have it. I'll do even better. I'll save it for
you. How's that? Until next Wednesday or Friday. More'n that no one
would do for you, now, would they?"</p>

<p>He smirked and shrugged his shoulders and acted as though he
were indeed doing her a great favor. And Hortense, going away, felt
that if only&mdash;only she could take that coat at one hundred and
fifteen dollars, she would be capturing a marvelous bargain. Also
that she would be the smartest-dressed girl in Kansas City beyond
the shadow of a doubt. If only she could in some way get a hundred
and fifteen dollars before next Wednesday, or Friday.</p>

<h3>Chapter 15</h3>

<p>As Hortense well knew Clyde was pressing more and more hungrily
toward that ultimate condescension on her part, which, though she
would never have admitted it to him, was the privilege of two
others. They were never together any more without his insisting
upon the real depth of her regard for him. Why was it, if she cared
for him the least bit, that she refused to do this, that or the
other&mdash;would not let him kiss her as much as he wished, would
not let him hold her in his arms as much as he would like. She was
always keeping dates with other fellows and breaking them or
refusing to make them with him. What was her exact relationship
toward these others? Did she really care more for them than she did
for him? In fact, they were never together anywhere but what this
problem of union was uppermost&mdash;and but thinly veiled.</p>

<p>And she liked to think that he was suffering from repressed
desire for her all of the time that she tortured him, and that the
power to allay his suffering lay wholly in her&mdash;a sadistic
trait which had for its soil Clyde's own masochistic yearning for
her.</p>

<p>However, in the face of her desire for the coat, his stature and
interest for her were beginning to increase. In spite of the fact
that only the morning before she had informed Clyde, with quite a
flourish, that she could not possibly see him until the following
Monday&mdash;that all her intervening nights were
taken&mdash;nevertheless, the problem of the coat looming up before
her, she now most eagerly planned to contrive an immediate
engagement with him without appearing too eager. For by then she
had definitely decided to endeavor to persuade him, if possible, to
buy the coat for her. Only of course, she would have to alter her
conduct toward him radically. She would have to be much
sweeter&mdash;more enticing. Although she did not actually say to
herself that now she might even be willing to yield herself to him,
still basically that was what was in her mind.</p>

<p>For quite a little while she was unable to think how to proceed.
How was she to see him this day, or the next at the very latest?
How should she go about putting before him the need of this gift,
or loan, as she finally worded it to herself? She might hint that
he could loan her enough to buy the coat and that later she would
pay him back by degrees (yet once in possession of the coat she
well knew that that necessity would never confront her). Or, if he
did not have so much money on hand at one time, she could suggest
that she might arrange with Mr. Rubenstein for a series of time
payments which could be met by Clyde. In this connection her mind
suddenly turned and began to consider how she could flatter and
cajole Mr. Rubenstein into letting her have the coat on easy terms.
She recalled that he had said he would be glad to buy the coat for
her if he thought she would be nice to him.</p>

<p>Her first scheme in connection with all this was to suggest to
Louise Ratterer to invite her brother, Clyde and a third youth by
the name of Scull, who was dancing attendance upon Louise, to come
to a certain dance hall that very evening to which she was already
planning to go with the more favored cigar clerk. Only now she
intended to break that engagement and appear alone with Louise and
Greta and announce that her proposed partner was ill. That would
give her an opportunity to leave early with Clyde and with him walk
past the Rubenstein store.</p>

<p>But having the temperament of a spider that spins a web for
flies, she foresaw that this might involve the possibility of
Louise's explaining to Clyde or Ratterer that it was Hortense who
had instigated the party. It might even bring up some accidental
mention of the coat on the part of Clyde to Louise later, which, as
she felt, would never do. She did not care to let her friends know
how she provided for herself. In consequence, she decided that it
would not do for her to appeal to Louise nor to Greta in this
fashion.</p>

<p>And she was actually beginning to worry as to how to bring about
this encounter, when Clyde, who chanced to be in the vicinity on
his way home from work, walked into the store where she was
working. He was seeking for a date on the following Sunday. And to
his intense delight, Hortense greeted him most cordially with a
most engaging smile and a wave of the hand. She was busy at the
moment with a customer. She soon finished, however, and drawing
near, and keeping one eye on her floor-walker who resented callers,
exclaimed: "I was just thinking about you. You wasn't thinking
about me, was you? Trade last." Then she added, sotto voce, "Don't
act like you are talking to me. I see our floorwalker over
there."</p>

<p>Arrested by the unusual sweetness in her voice, to say nothing
of the warm smile with which she greeted him, Clyde was enlivened
and heartened at once. "Was I thinking of you?" he returned gayly.
"Do I ever think of any one else? Say! Ratterer says I've got you
on the brain."</p>

<p>"Oh, him," replied Hortense, pouting spitefully and scornfully,
for Ratterer, strangely enough, was one whom she did not interest
very much, and this she knew. "He thinks he's so smart," she added.
"I know a lotta girls don't like him."</p>

<p>"Oh, Tom's all right," pleaded Clyde, loyally. "That's just his
way of talking. He likes you."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, he don't, either," replied Hortense. "But I don't want
to talk about him. Whatcha doin' around six o'clock to-night?"</p>

<p>"Oh, gee!" exclaimed Clyde disappointedly. "You don't mean to
say you got to-night free, have you? Well, ain't that tough? I
thought you were all dated up. I got to work!" He actually sighed,
so depressed was he by the thought that she might be willing to
spend the evening with him and he not able to avail himself of the
opportunity, while Hortense, noting his intense disappointment, was
pleased.</p>

<p>"Well, I gotta date, but I don't want to keep it," she went on
with a contemptuous gathering of the lips. "I don't have to break
it. I would though if you was free." Clyde's heart began to beat
rapidly with delight.</p>

<p>"Gee, I wish I didn't have to work now," he went on, looking at
her. "You're sure you couldn't make it to-morrow night? I'm off
then. And I was just coming up here to ask you if you didn't want
to go for an automobile ride next Sunday afternoon, maybe. A friend
of Hegglund's got a car&mdash;a Packard&mdash;and Sunday we're all
off. And he wanted me to get a bunch to run out to Excelsior
Springs. He's a nice fellow" (this because Hortense showed signs of
not being so very much interested). "You don't know him very well,
but he is. But say, I can talk to you about that later. How about
to-morrow night? I'm off then."</p>

<p>Hortense, who, because of the hovering floor-walker, was
pretending to show Clyde some handkerchiefs, was now thinking how
unfortunate that a whole twenty-four hours must intervene before
she could bring him to view the coat with her&mdash;and so have an
opportunity to begin her machinations. At the same time she
pretended that the proposed meeting for the next night was a very
difficult thing to bring about&mdash;more difficult than he could
possibly appreciate. She even pretended to be somewhat uncertain as
to whether she wanted to do it.</p>

<p>"Just pretend you're examining these handkerchiefs here," she
continued, fearing the floor-walker might interrupt. "I gotta
nother date for then," she continued thoughtfully, "and I don't
know whether I can break it or not. Let me see." She feigned deep
thought. "Well, I guess I can," she said finally. "I'll try,
anyhow. Just for this once. You be here at Fifteenth and Main at
6.15&mdash;no, 6.30's the best you can do, ain't it?&mdash;and I'll
see if I can't get there. I won't promise, but I'll see and I think
I can make it. Is that all right?" She gave him one of her sweetest
smiles and Clyde was quite beside himself with satisfaction. To
think that she would break a date for him, at last. Her eyes were
warm with favor and her mouth wreathed with a smile.</p>

<p>"Surest thing you know," he exclaimed, voicing the slang of the
hotel boys. "You bet I'll be there. Will you do me a favor?"</p>

<p>"What is it?" she asked cautiously.</p>

<p>"Wear that little black hat with the red ribbon under your chin,
will you? You look so cute in that."</p>

<p>"Oh, you," she laughed. It was so easy to kid Clyde. "Yes, I'll
wear it," she added. "But you gotta go now. Here comes that old
fish. I know he's going to kick. But I don't care. Six-thirty, eh?
So long." She turned to give her attention to a new customer, an
old lady who had been patiently waiting to inquire if she could
tell her where the muslins were sold. And Clyde, tingling with
pleasure because of this unexpected delight vouchsafed him, made
his way most elatedly to the nearest exit.</p>

<p>He was not made unduly curious because of this sudden favor, and
the next evening, promptly at six-thirty, and in the glow of the
overhanging arc-lights showering their glistening radiance like
rain, she appeared. As he noted, at once, she had worn the hat he
liked. Also she was enticingly ebullient and friendly, more so than
at any time he had known her. Before he had time to say that she
looked pretty, or how pleased he was because she wore that hat, she
began:</p>

<p>"Some favorite you're gettin' to be, <i>I'll say</i>, when
<i>I'll</i> break an engagement and then wear an old hat I don't
like just to please you. How do I get that way is what I'd like to
know."</p>

<p>He beamed as though he had won a great victory. Could it be that
at last he might be becoming a favorite with her?</p>

<p>"If you only knew how cute you look in that hat, Hortense, you
wouldn't knock it," he urged admiringly. "You don't know how sweet
you do look."</p>

<p>"Oh, ho. In this old thing?" she scoffed. "You certainly are
easily pleased, I'll say."</p>

<p>"An' your eyes are just like soft, black velvet," he persisted
eagerly. "They're wonderful." He was thinking of an alcove in the
Green-Davidson hung with black velvet.</p>

<p>"Gee, you certainly have got 'em to-night," she laughed,
teasingly. "I'll have to do something about you." Then, before he
could make any reply to this, she went off into an entirely
fictional account of how, having had a previous engagement with a
certain alleged young society man&mdash;Tom Keary by name&mdash;who
was dogging her steps these days in order to get her to dine and
dance, she had only this evening decided to "ditch" him, preferring
Clyde, of course, for this occasion, anyhow. And she had called
Keary up and told him that she could not see him
to-night&mdash;called it all off, as it were. But just the same, on
coming out of the employee's entrance, who should she see there
waiting for her but this same Tom Keary, dressed to perfection in a
bright gray raglan and spats, and with his closed sedan, too. And
he would have taken her to the Green-Davidson, if she had wanted to
go. He was a real sport. But she didn't. Not to-night, anyhow. Yet,
if she had not contrived to avoid him, he would have delayed her.
But she espied him first and ran the other way.</p>

<p>"And you should have just seen my little feet twinkle up Sargent
and around the corner into Bailey Place," was the way she
narcissistically painted her flight. And so infatuated was Clyde by
this picture of herself and the wonderful Keary that he accepted
all of her petty fabrications as truth.</p>

<p>And then, as they were walking in the direction of Gaspie's, a
restaurant in Wyandotte near Tenth which quite lately he had
learned was much better than Frissell's, Hortense took occasion to
pause and look in a number of windows, saying as she did so that
she certainly did wish that she could find a little coat that was
becoming to her&mdash;that the one she had on was getting worn and
that she must have another soon&mdash;a predicament which caused
Clyde to wonder at the time whether she was suggesting to him that
he get her one. Also whether it might not advance his cause with
her if he were to buy her a little jacket, since she needed it.</p>

<p>But Rubenstein's coming into view on this same side of the
street, its display window properly illuminated and the coat in
full view, Hortense paused as she had planned.</p>

<p>"Oh, do look at that darling little coat there," she began,
ecstatically, as though freshly arrested by the beauty of it, her
whole manner suggesting a first and unspoiled impression. "Oh,
isn't that the dearest, sweetest, cutest little thing you ever did
see?" she went on, her histrionic powers growing with her desire
for it. "Oh, just look at the collar, and those sleeves and those
pockets. Aren't they the snappiest things you ever saw? Couldn't I
just warm my little hands in those?" She glanced at Clyde out of
the tail of her eye to see if he was being properly impressed.</p>

<p>And he, aroused by her intense interest, surveyed the coat with
not a little curiosity. Unquestionably it was a pretty
coat&mdash;very. But, gee, what would a coat like that cost,
anyhow? Could it be that she was trying to interest him in the
merits of a coat like that in order that he might get it for her?
Why, it must be a two-hundred-dollar coat at least. He had no idea
as to the value of such things, anyhow. He certainly couldn't
afford a coat like that. And especially at this time when his
mother was taking a good portion of his extra cash for Esta. And
yet something in her manner seemed to bring it to him that that was
exactly what she was thinking. It chilled and almost numbed him at
first.</p>

<p>And yet, as he now told himself sadly, if Hortense wanted it,
she could most certainly find some one who would get it for
her&mdash;that young Tom Keary, for instance, whom she had just
been describing. And, worse luck, she was just that kind of a girl.
And if he could not get it for her, some one else could and she
would despise him for not being able to do such things for her.</p>

<p>To his intense dismay and dissatisfaction she exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Oh, what wouldn't I give for a coat like that!" She had not
intended at the moment to put the matter so bluntly, for she wanted
to convey the thought that was deepest in her mind to Clyde
tactfully.</p>

<p>And Clyde, inexperienced as he was, and not subtle by any means,
was nevertheless quite able to gather the meaning of that. It
meant&mdash;it meant&mdash;for the moment he was not quite willing
to formulate to himself what it did mean. And
now&mdash;now&mdash;if only he had the price of that coat. He could
feel that she was thinking of some one certain way to get the coat.
And yet how was he to manage it? How? If he could only arrange to
get this coat for her&mdash;if he only could promise her that he
would get it for her by a certain date, say, if it didn't cost too
much, then what? Did he have the courage to suggest to her
to-night, or to-morrow, say, after he had learned the price of the
coat, that if she would&mdash;why then&mdash;why then, well, he
would get her the coat or anything else she really wanted. Only he
must be sure that she was not really fooling him as she was always
doing in smaller ways. He wouldn't stand for getting her the coat
and then get nothing in return&mdash;never!</p>

<p>As he thought of it, he actually thrilled and trembled beside
her. And she, standing there and looking at the coat, was thinking
that unless he had sense enough now to get her this thing and to
get what she meant&mdash;how she intended to pay for it&mdash;well
then, this was the last. He need not think she was going to fool
around with any one who couldn't or wouldn't do that much for her.
Never.</p>

<p>They resumed their walk toward Gaspie's. And throughout the
dinner, she talked of little else&mdash;how attractive the coat
was, how wonderful it would look on her.</p>

<p>"Believe me," she said at one point, defiantly, feeling that
Clyde was perhaps uncertain at the moment about his ability to buy
it for her, "I'm going to find some way to get that coat. I think,
maybe, that Rubenstein store would let me have it on time if I were
to go in there and see him about it, make a big enough payment
down. Another girl out of our store got a coat that way once," she
lied promptly, hoping thus to induce Clyde to assist her with it.
But Clyde, disturbed by the fear of some extraordinary cost in
connection with it, hesitated to say just what he would do. He
could not even guess the price of such a thing&mdash;it might cost
two or three hundred even&mdash;and he feared to obligate himself
to do something which later he might not be able to do.</p>

<p>"You don't know what they might want for that, do you?" he
asked, nervously, at the same time thinking if he made any cash
gift to her at this time without some guarantee on her part, what
right would he have to expect anything more in return than he had
ever received? He knew how she cajoled him into getting things for
her and then would not even let him kiss her. He flushed and
churned a little internally with resentment at the thought of how
she seemed to feel that she could play fast and loose with him. And
yet, as he now recalled, she had just said she would do anything
for any one who would get that coat for her&mdash;or nearly
that.</p>

<p>"No-o," she hesitated at first, for the moment troubled as to
whether to give the exact price or something higher. For if she
asked for time, Mr. Rubenstein might want more. And yet if she said
much more, Clyde might not want to help her. "But I know it
wouldn't be more than a hundred and twenty-five. I wouldn't pay
more than that for it."</p>

<p>Clyde heaved a sigh of relief. After all, it wasn't two or three
hundred. He began to think now that if she could arrange to make
any reasonable down payment&mdash;say, fifty or sixty
dollars&mdash;he might manage to bring it together within the next
two or three weeks anyhow. But if the whole hundred and twenty-five
were demanded at once, Hortense would have to wait, and besides he
would have to know whether he was to be rewarded or
not&mdash;definitely.</p>

<p>"That's a good idea, Hortense," he exclaimed without, however,
indicating in any way why it appealed to him so much. "Why don't
you do that? Why don't you find out first what they want for it,
and how much they want down? Maybe I could help you with it."</p>

<p>"Oh, won't that be just too wonderful!" Hortense clapped her
hands. "Oh, will you? Oh, won't that be just dandy? Now I just know
I can get that coat. I just know they'll let me have it, if I talk
to them right."</p>

<p>She was, as Clyde saw and feared, quite forgetting the fact that
he was the one who was making the coat possible, and now it would
be just as he thought. The fact that he was paying for it would be
taken for granted.</p>

<p>But a moment later, observing his glum face, she added: "Oh,
aren't you the sweetest, dearest thing, to help me in this way. You
just bet I won't forget this either. You just wait and see. You
won't be sorry. Now you just wait." Her eyes fairly snapped with
gayety and even generosity toward him.</p>

<p>He might be easy and young, but he wasn't mean, and she would
reward him, too, she now decided. Just as soon as she got the coat,
which must be in a week or two at the latest, she was going to be
very nice to him&mdash;do something for him. And to emphasize her
own thoughts and convey to him what she really meant, she allowed
her eyes to grow soft and swimming and to dwell on him
promisingly&mdash; a bit of romantic acting which caused him to
become weak and nervous. The gusto of her favor frightened him even
a little, for it suggested, as he fancied, a disturbing vitality
which he might not be able to match. He felt a little weak before
her now&mdash;a little cowardly&mdash;in the face of what he
assumed her real affection might mean.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he now announced that if the coat did not cost
more than one hundred and twenty-five dollars, that sum to be
broken into one payment of twenty-five dollars down and two
additional sums of fifty dollars each, he could manage it. And she
on her part replied that she was going the very next day to see
about it. Mr. Rubenstein might be induced to let her have it at
once on the payment of twenty-five dollars down; if not that, then
at the end of the second week, when nearly all would be paid.</p>

<p>And then in real gratitude to Clyde she whispered to him, coming
out of the restaurant and purring like a cat, that she would never
forget this and that he would see&mdash;and that she would wear it
for him the very first time. If he were not working they might go
somewhere to dinner. Or, if not that, then she would have it surely
in time for the day of the proposed automobile ride which he, or
rather Hegglund, had suggested for the following Sunday, but which
might be postponed.</p>

<p>She suggested that they go to a certain dance hall, and there
she clung to him in the dances in a suggestive way and afterwards
hinted of a mood which made Clyde a little quivery and erratic.</p>

<p>He finally went home, dreaming of the day, satisfied that he
would have no trouble in bringing together the first payment, if it
were so much as fifty, even. For now, under the spur of this
promise, he proposed to borrow as much as twenty-five from either
Ratterer or Hegglund, and to repay it after the coat was paid
for.</p>

<p>But, ah, the beautiful Hortense. The charm of her, the enormous,
compelling, weakening delight. And to think that at last, and soon,
she was to be his. It was, plainly, of such stuff as dreams are
made of&mdash;the unbelievable become real.</p>

<h3>Chapter 16</h3>

<p>True to her promise, the following day Hortense returned to Mr.
Rubenstein, and with all the cunning of her nature placed before
him, with many reservations, the nature of the dilemma which
confronted her. Could she, by any chance, have the coat for one
hundred and fifteen dollars on an easy payment plan? Mr.
Rubenstein's head forthwith began to wag a solemn negative. This
was not an easy payment store. If he wanted to do business that way
he could charge two hundred for the coat and easily get it.</p>

<p>"But I could pay as much as fifty dollars when I took the coat,"
argued Hortense.</p>

<p>"Very good. But who is to guarantee that I get the other
sixty-five, and when?"</p>

<p>"Next week twenty-five, and the week after that twenty five and
the next week after that fifteen."</p>

<p>"Of course. But supposin' the next day after you take the coat
an automobile runs you down and kills you. Then what? How do I get
my money?"</p>

<p>Now that was a poser. And there was really no way that she could
prove that any one would pay for the coat. And before that there
would have to be all the bother of making out a contract, and
getting some really responsible person&mdash;a banker, say&mdash;to
endorse it. No, no, this was not an easy payment house. This was a
cash house. That was why the coat was offered to her at one hundred
and fifteen, but not a dollar less. Not a dollar.</p>

<p>Mr. Rubenstein sighed and talked on. And finally Hortense asked
him if she could give him seventy-five dollars cash in hand, the
other forty to be paid in one week's time. Would he let her have
the coat then&mdash;to take home with her?</p>

<p>"But a week&mdash;a week&mdash;what is a week then?" argued Mr.
Rubenstein. "If you can bring me seventy-five next week or
to-morrow, and forty more in another week or ten days, why not wait
a week and bring the whole hundred and fifteen? Then the coat is
yours and no bother. Leave the coat. Come back to-morrow and pay me
twenty-five or thirty dollars on account and I take the coat out of
the window and lock it up for you. No one can even see it then. In
another week bring me the balance or in two weeks. Then it is
yours." Mr. Rubenstein explained the process as though it were a
difficult matter to grasp.</p>

<p>But the argument once made was sound enough. It really left
Hortense little to argue about. At the same time it reduced her
spirit not a little. To think of not being able to take it now. And
yet, once out of the place, her vigor revived. For, after all, the
time fixed would soon pass and if Clyde performed his part of the
agreement promptly, the coat would be hers. The important thing now
was to make him give her twenty-five or thirty dollars wherewith to
bind this wonderful agreement. Only now, because of the fact that
she felt that she needed a new hat to go with the coat, she decided
to say that it cost one hundred and twenty-five instead of one
hundred and fifteen.</p>

<p>And once this conclusion was put before Clyde, he saw it as a
very reasonable arrangement&mdash;all things considered&mdash;quite
a respite from the feeling of strain that had settled upon him
after his last conversation with Hortense. For, after all, he had
not seen how he was to raise more than thirty-five dollars this
first week anyhow. The following week would be somewhat easier, for
then, as he told himself, he proposed to borrow twenty or
twenty-five from Ratterer if he could, which, joined with the
twenty or twenty-five which his tips would bring him, would be
quite sufficient to meet the second payment. The week following he
proposed to borrow at least ten or fifteen from
Hegglund&mdash;maybe more&mdash;and if that did not make up the
required amount to pawn his watch for fifteen dollars, the watch he
had bought for himself a few months before. It ought to bring that
at least; it cost fifty.</p>

<p>But, he now thought, there was Esta in her wretched room
awaiting the most unhappy result of her one romance. How was she to
make out, he asked himself, even in the face of the fact that he
feared to be included in the financial problem which Esta as well
as the family presented. His father was not now, and never had
been, of any real financial service to his mother. And yet, if the
problem were on this account to be shifted to him, how would he
make out? Why need his father always peddle clocks and rugs and
preach on the streets? Why couldn't his mother and father give up
the mission idea, anyhow?</p>

<p>But, as he knew, the situation was not to be solved without his
aid. And the proof of it came toward the end of the second week of
his arrangement with Hortense, when, with fifty dollars in his
pocket, which he was planning to turn over to her on the following
Sunday, his mother, looking into his bedroom where he was dressing,
said: "I'd like to see you for a minute, Clyde, before you go out."
He noted she was very grave as she said this. As a matter of fact,
for several days past, he had been sensing that she was undergoing
a strain of some kind. At the same time he had been thinking all
this while that with his own resources hypothecated as they were,
he could do nothing. Or, if he did it meant the loss of Hortense.
He dared not.</p>

<p>And yet what reasonable excuse could he give his mother for not
helping her a little, considering especially the clothes he wore,
and the manner in which he had been running here and there, always
giving the excuse of working, but probably not deceiving her as
much as he thought. To be sure, only two months before, he had
obligated himself to pay her ten dollars a week more for five
weeks, and had. But that only proved to her very likely that he had
so much extra to give, even though he had tried to make it clear at
the time that he was pinching himself to do it. And yet, however
much he chose to waver in her favor, he could not, with his desire
for Hortense directly confronting him.</p>

<p>He went out into the living-room after a time, and as usual his
mother at once led the way to one of the benches in the
mission&mdash; a cheerless, cold room these days.</p>

<p>"I didn't think I'd have to speak to you about this, Clyde, but
I don't see any other way out of it. I haven't anyone but you to
depend upon now that you're getting to be a man. But you must
promise not to tell any of the others&mdash;Frank or Julia or your
father. I don't want them to know. But Esta's back here in Kansas
City and in trouble, and I don't know quite what to do about her. I
have so very little money to do with, and your father's not very
much of a help to me any more."</p>

<p>She passed a weary, reflective hand across her forehead and
Clyde knew what was coming. His first thought was to pretend that
he did not know that Esta was in the city, since he had been
pretending this way for so long. But now, suddenly, in the face of
his mother's confession, and the need of pretended surprise on his
part, if he were to keep up the fiction, he said, "Yes, I
know."</p>

<p>"You know?" queried his mother, surprised.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know," Clyde repeated. "I saw you going in that house in
Beaudry Street one morning as I was going along there," he
announced calmly enough now. "And I saw Esta looking out of the
window afterwards, too. So I went in after you left."</p>

<p>"How long ago was that?" she asked, more to gain time than
anything else.</p>

<p>"Oh, about five or six weeks ago, I think. I been around to see
her a coupla times since then, only Esta didn't want me to say
anything about that either."</p>

<p>"Tst! Tst! Tst!" clicked Mrs. Griffiths, with her tongue. "Then
you know what the trouble is."</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Clyde.</p>

<p>"Well, what is to be will be," she said resignedly. "You haven't
mentioned it to Frank or Julia, have you?"</p>

<p>"No," replied Clyde, thoughtfully, thinking of what a failure
his mother had made of her attempt to be secretive. She was no one
to deceive any one, or his father, either. He thought himself far,
far shrewder.</p>

<p>"Well, you mustn't," cautioned his mother solemnly. "It isn't
best for them to know, I think. It's bad enough as it is this way,"
she added with a kind of wry twist to her mouth, the while Clyde
thought of himself and Hortense.</p>

<p>"And to think," she added, after a moment, her eyes filling with
a sad, all-enveloping gray mist, "she should have brought all this
on herself and on us. And when we have so little to do with, as it
is. And after all the instruction she has had&mdash;the training.
'The way of the transgressor&mdash;'"</p>

<p>She shook her head and put her two large hands together and
gripped them firmly, while Clyde stared, thinking of the situation
and all that it might mean to him.</p>

<p>She sat there, quite reduced and bewildered by her own peculiar
part in all this. She had been as deceiving as any one, really. And
here was Clyde, now, fully informed as to her falsehoods and
strategy, and herself looking foolish and untrue. But had she not
been trying to save him from all this&mdash;him and the others? And
he was old enough to understand that now. Yet she now proceeded to
explain why, and to say how dreadful she felt it all to be. At the
same time, as she also explained, now she was compelled to come to
him for aid in connection with it.</p>

<p>"Esta's about to be very sick," she went on suddenly and
stiffly, not being able, or at least willing, apparently, to look
at Clyde as she said it, and yet determined to be as frank as
possible. "She'll need a doctor very shortly and some one to be
with her all the time when I'm not there. I must get money
somewhere&mdash;at least fifty dollars. You couldn't get me that
much in some way, from some of your young men friends, could you,
just a loan for a few weeks? You could pay it back, you know, soon,
if you would. You wouldn't need to pay me anything for your room
until you had."</p>

<p>She looked at Clyde so tensely, so urgently, that he felt quite
shaken by the force of the cogency of the request. And before he
could add anything to the nervous gloom which shadowed her face,
she added: "That other money was for her, you know, to bring her
back here after her&mdash;her"&mdash;she hesitated over the
appropriate word but finally added&mdash;"husband left her there in
Pittsburgh. I suppose she told you that."</p>

<p>"Yes, she did," replied Clyde, heavily and sadly. For after all,
Esta's condition was plainly critical, which was something that he
had not stopped to meditate on before.</p>

<p>"Gee, Ma," he exclaimed, the thought of the fifty dollars in his
pocket and its intended destination troubling him
considerably&mdash;the very sum his mother was seeking. "I don't
know whether I can do that or not. I don't know any of the boys
down there well enough for that. And they don't make any more than
I do, either. I might borrow a little something, but it won't look
very good." He choked and swallowed a little, for lying to his
mother in this way was not easy. In fact, he had never had occasion
to lie in connection with anything so trying&mdash;and so
despicably. For here was fifty dollars in his pocket at the moment,
with Hortense on the one hand and his mother and sister on the
other, and the money would solve his mother's problem as fully as
it would Hortense's, and more respectably. How terrible it was not
to help her. How could he refuse her, really? Nervously he licked
his lips and passed a hand over his brow, for a nervous moisture
had broken out upon his face. He felt strained and mean and
incompetent under the circumstances.</p>

<p>"And you haven't any money of your own right now that you could
let me have, have you?" his mother half pleaded. For there were a
number of things in connection with Esta's condition which required
immediate cash and she had so little.</p>

<p>"No, I haven't, Ma," he said, looking at his mother
shamefacedly, for a moment, then away, and if it had not been that
she herself was so distrait, she might have seen the falsehood on
his face. As it was, he suffered a pang of commingled
self-commiseration and self-contempt, based on the distress he felt
for his mother. He could not bring himself to think of losing
Hortense. He must have her. And yet his mother looked so lone and
so resourceless. It was shameful. He was low, really mean. Might he
not, later, be punished for a thing like this?</p>

<p>He tried to think of some other way&mdash;some way of getting a
little money over and above the fifty that might help. If only he
had a little more time&mdash;a few weeks longer. If only Hortense
had not brought up this coat idea just now.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what I might do," he went on, quite foolishly and
dully the while his mother gave vent to a helpless "Tst! Tst! Tst!"
"Will five dollars do you any good?"</p>

<p>"Well, it will be something, anyhow," she replied. "I can use
it."</p>

<p>"Well, I can let you have that much," he said, thinking to
replace it out of his next week's tips and trust to better luck
throughout the week. "And I'll see what I can do next week. I might
let you have ten then. I can't say for sure. I had to borrow some
of that other money I gave you, and I haven't got through paying
for that yet, and if I come around trying to get more, they'll
think&mdash;well, you know how it is."</p>

<p>His mother sighed, thinking of the misery of having to fall back
on her one son thus far. And just when he was trying to get a
start, too. What would he think of all this in after years? What
would he think of her&mdash;of Esta&mdash;the family? For, for all
his ambition and courage and desire to be out and doing, Clyde
always struck her as one who was not any too powerful physically or
rock-ribbed morally or mentally. So far as his nerves and emotions
were concerned, at times he seemed to take after his father more
than he did after her. And for the most part it was so easy to
excite him&mdash; to cause him to show tenseness and
strain&mdash;as though he were not so very well fitted for either.
And it was she, because of Esta and her husband and their joint and
unfortunate lives, that was and had been heaping the greater part
of this strain on him.</p>

<p>"Well, if you can't, you can't," she said. "I must try and think
of some other way." But she saw no clear way at the moment.</p>

<h3>Chapter 17</h3>

<p>In connection with the automobile ride suggested and arranged
for the following Sunday by Hegglund through his chauffeur friend,
a change of plan was announced. The car&mdash;an expensive Packard,
no less&mdash;could not be had for that day, but must be used by
this Thursday or Friday, or not at all. For, as had been previously
explained to all, but not with the strictest adherence to the
truth, the car belonged to a certain Mr. Kimbark, an elderly and
very wealthy man who at the time was traveling in Asia. Also, what
was not true was that this particular youth was not Mr. Kimbark's
chauffeur at all, but rather the rakish, ne'er-do-well son of
Sparser, the superintendent of one of Mr. Kimbark's stock farms.
This son being anxious to pose as something more than the son of a
superintendent of a farm, and as an occasional watchman, having
access to the cars, had decided to take the very finest of them and
ride in it.</p>

<p>It was Hegglund who proposed that he and his hotel friends be
included on some interesting trip. But since the general invitation
had been given, word had come that within the next few weeks Mr.
Kimbark was likely to return. And because of this, Willard Sparser
had decided at once that it might be best not to use the car any
more. He might be taken unawares, perhaps, by Mr. Kimbark's
unexpected arrival. Laying this difficulty before Hegglund, who was
eager for the trip, the latter had scouted the idea. Why not use it
once more anyhow? He had stirred up the interest of all of his
friends in this and now hated to disappoint them. The following
Friday, between noon and six o'clock, was fixed upon as the day.
And since Hortense had changed in her plans she now decided to
accompany Clyde, who had been invited, of course.</p>

<p>But as Hegglund had explained to Ratterer and Higby since it was
being used without the owner's consent, they must meet rather far
out&mdash;the men in one of the quiet streets near Seventeenth and
West Prospect, from which point they could proceed to a meeting
place more convenient for the girls, namely, Twentieth and
Washington. From thence they would speed via the west Parkway and
the Hannibal Bridge north and east to Harlem, North Kansas City,
Minaville and so through Liberty and Moseby to Excelsior Springs.
Their chief objective there was a little inn&mdash;the
Wigwam&mdash;a mile or two this side of Excelsior which was open
the year around. It was really a combination of restaurant and
dancing parlor and hotel. A Victrola and Wurlitzer player-piano
furnished the necessary music. Such groups as this were not
infrequent, and Hegglund as well as Higby, who had been there on
several occasions, described it as dandy. The food was good and the
road to it excellent. There was a little river just below it where
in the summer time at least there was rowing and fishing. In winter
some people skated when there was ice. To be sure, at this
time&mdash;January&mdash;the road was heavily packed with snow, but
easy to get over, and the scenery fine. There was a little lake,
not so far from Excelsior, at this time of year also frozen over,
and according to Hegglund, who was always unduly imaginative and
high-spirited, they might go there and skate.</p>

<p>"Will you listen to who's talkin' about skatin' on a trip like
this?" commented Ratterer, rather cynically, for to his way of
thinking this was no occasion for any such side athletics, but for
love-making exclusively.</p>

<p>"Aw, hell, can't a fellow have a funny idea even widout bein'
roasted for it?" retorted the author of the idea.</p>

<p>The only one, apart from Sparser, who suffered any qualms in
connection with all this was Clyde himself. For to him, from the
first, the fact that the car to be used did not belong to Sparser,
but to his employer, was disturbing, almost irritatingly so. He did
not like the idea of taking anything that belonged to any one else,
even for temporary use. Something might happen. They might be found
out.</p>

<p>"Don't you think it's dangerous for us to be going out in this
car?" he asked of Ratterer a few days before the trip and when he
fully understood the nature of the source of the car.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know," replied Ratterer, who being accustomed to
such ideas and devices as this was not much disturbed by them. "I'm
not taking the car and you're not, are you? If he wants to take it,
that's his lookout, ain't it? If he wants me to go, I'll go. Why
wouldn't I? All I want is to be brought back here on time. That's
the only thing that would ever worry me."</p>

<p>And Higby, coming up at the moment, had voiced exactly the same
sentiments. Yet Clyde remained troubled. It might not work out
right; he might lose his job through a thing like this. But so
fascinated was he by the thought of riding in such a fine car with
Hortense and with all these other girls and boys that he could not
resist the temptation to go.</p>

<p>Immediately after noon on the Friday of this particular week the
several participants of the outing were gathered at the points
agreed upon. Hegglund, Ratterer, Higby and Clyde at Eighteenth and
West Prospect near the railroad yards. Maida Axelrod, Hegglund's
girl, Lucille Nickolas, a friend of Ratterer's, and Tina Kogel, a
friend of Higby's, also Laura Sipe, another girl who was brought by
Tina Kogel to be introduced to Sparser for the occasion, at
Twentieth and Washington. Only since Hortense had sent word at the
last moment to Clyde that she had to go out to her house for
something, and that they were to run out to Forty-ninth and
Genesee, where she lived, they did so, but not without
grumbling.</p>

<p>The day, a late January one, was inclined to be smoky with
lowering clouds, especially within the environs of Kansas City. It
even threatened snow at times&mdash;a most interesting and
picturesque prospect to those within. They liked it.</p>

<p>"Oh, gee, I hope it does," Tina Kogel exclaimed when some one
commented on the possibility, and Lucille Nickolas added: "Oh, I
just love to see it snow at times." Along the West Bluff Road,
Washington and Second Streets, they finally made their way across
the Hannibal Bridge to Harlem, and from thence along the winding
and hill-sentineled river road to Randolph Heights and Minaville.
And beyond that came Moseby and Liberty, to and through which the
road bed was better, with interesting glimpses of small homesteads
and the bleak snow-covered hills of January.</p>

<p>Clyde, who for all his years in Kansas City had never ventured
much beyond Kansas City, Kansas, on the west or the primitive and
natural woods of Swope Park on the east, nor farther along the
Kansas or Missouri Rivers than Argentine on the one side and
Randolph Heights on the other, was quite fascinated by the idea of
travel which appeared to be suggested by all this&mdash;distant
travel. It was all so different from his ordinary routine. And on
this occasion Hortense was inclined to be very genial and friendly.
She snuggled down beside him on the seat, and when he, noting that
the others had already drawn their girls to them in affectionate
embraces, put his arm about her and drew her to him, she made no
particular protest. Instead she looked up and said: "I'll have to
take my hat off, I guess." The others laughed. There was something
about her quick, crisp way which was amusing at times. Besides she
had done her hair in a new way which made her look decidedly
prettier, and she was anxious to have the others see it.</p>

<p>"Can we dance anywhere out here?" she called to the others,
without looking around.</p>

<p>"Surest thing you know," said Higby, who by now had persuaded
Tina Kogel to take her hat off and was holding her close. "They got
a player-piano and a Victrola out there. If I'd 'a' thought, I'd
'a' brought my cornet. I can play Dixie on that."</p>

<p>The car was speeding at breakneck pace over a snowy white road
and between white fields. In fact, Sparser, considering himself a
master of car manipulation as well as the real owner of it for the
moment, was attempting to see how fast he could go on such a
road.</p>

<p>Dark vignettes of wood went by to right and left. Fields away,
sentinel hills rose and fell like waves. A wide-armed scarecrow
fluttering in the wind, its tall decayed hat awry, stood near at
hand in one place. And from near it a flock of crows rose and
winged direct toward a distant wood lightly penciled against a
foreground of snow.</p>

<p>In the front seat sat Sparser, guiding the car beside Laura Sipe
with the air of one to whom such a magnificent car was a
commonplace thing. He was really more interested in Hortense, yet
felt it incumbent on him, for the time being, anyhow, to show some
attention to Laura Sipe. And not to be outdone in gallantry by the
others, he now put one arm about Laura Sipe while he guided the car
with the other, a feat which troubled Clyde, who was still dubious
about the wisdom of taking the car at all. They might all be
wrecked by such fast driving. Hortense was only interested by the
fact that Sparser had obviously manifested his interest in her;
that he had to pay some attention to Laura Sipe whether he wanted
to or not. And when she saw him pull her to him and asked her
grandly if she had done much automobiling about Kansas City, she
merely smiled to herself.</p>

<p>But Ratterer, noting the move, nudged Lucille Nickolas, and she
in turn nudged Higby, in order to attract his attention to the
affectional development ahead.</p>

<p>"Getting comfortable up front there, Willard?" called Ratterer,
genially, in order to make friends with him.</p>

<p>"I'll say I am," replied Sparser, gayly and without turning.
"How about you, girlie?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm all right," Laura Sipe replied.</p>

<p>But Clyde was thinking that of all the girls present none was
really so pretty as Hortense&mdash;not nearly. She had come garbed
in a red and black dress with a very dark red poke bonnet to match.
And on her left cheek, just below her small rouged mouth, she had
pasted a minute square of black court plaster in imitation of some
picture beauty she had seen. In fact, before the outing began, she
had been determined to outshine all the others present, and
distinctly she was now feeling that she was succeeding. And Clyde,
for himself, was agreeing with her.</p>

<p>"You're the cutest thing here," whispered Clyde, hugging her
fondly.</p>

<p>"Gee, but you can pour on the molasses, kid, when you want to,"
she called out loud, and the others laughed. And Clyde flushed
slightly.</p>

<p>Beyond Minaville about six miles the car came to a bend in a
hollow where there was a country store and here Hegglund, Higby and
Ratterer got out to fetch candy, cigarettes and ice cream cones and
ginger ale. And after that came Liberty, and then several miles
this side of Excelsior Springs, they sighted the Wigwam which was
nothing more than an old two-story farmhouse snuggled against a
rise of ground behind it. There was, however, adjoining it on one
side a newer and larger one-story addition consisting of the
dining-room, the dance floor, and concealed by a partition at one
end, a bar. An open fire flickered cheerfully here in a large
fireplace. Down in a hollow across the road might be seen the
Benton River or creek, now frozen solid.</p>

<p>"There's your river," called Higby cheerfully as he helped Tina
Kogel out of the car, for he was already very much warmed by
several drinks he had taken en route. They all paused for a moment
to admire the stream, winding away among the trees. "I wanted dis
bunch to bring dere skates and go down dere," sighed Hegglund, "but
dey wouldn't. Well, dat's all right."</p>

<p>By then Lucille Nickolas, seeing a flicker of flame reflected in
one of the small windows of the inn, called, "Oh, see, they gotta
fire."</p>

<p>The car was parked, and they all trooped into the inn, and at
once Higby briskly went over and started the large, noisy,
clattery, tinny Nickelodeon with a nickel. And to rival him, and
for a prank, Hegglund ran to the Victrola which stood in one corner
and put on a record of "The Grizzly Bear," which he found lying
there.</p>

<p>At the first sounds of this strain, which they all knew, Tina
Kogel called: "Oh, let's all dance to that, will you? Can't you
stop that other old thing?" she added.</p>

<p>"Sure, after it runs down," explained Ratterer, laughingly. "The
only way to stop that thing is not to feed it any nickels."</p>

<p>But now a waiter coming in, Higby began to inquire what
everybody wanted. And in the meantime, to show off her charms,
Hortense had taken the center of the floor and was attempting to
imitate a grizzly bear walking on its hind legs, which she could do
amusingly enough&mdash;quite gracefully. And Sparser, seeing her
alone in the center of the floor was anxious to interest her now,
followed her and tried to imitate her motions from behind. Finding
him clever at it, and anxious to dance, she finally abandoned the
imitation and giving him her arms went one-stepping about the room
most vividly. At once, Clyde, who was by no means as good a dancer,
became jealous&mdash;painfully so. In his eagerness for her, it
seemed unfair to him that he should be deserted by her so
early&mdash;at the very beginning of things. But she, becoming
interested in Sparser, who seemed more worldly-wise, paid no
attention at all to Clyde for the time being, but went dancing with
her new conquest, his rhythmic skill seeming charmingly to match
her own. And then, not to be out of it, the others at once chose
partners, Hegglund dancing with Maida, Ratterer with Lucille and
Higby with Tina Kogel. This left Laura Sipe for Clyde, who did not
like her very much. She was not as perfect as she might be&mdash;a
plump, pudgy-faced girl with inadequate sensual blue eyes&mdash;and
Clyde, lacking any exceptional skill, they danced nothing but the
conventional one-step while the others were dipping and lurching
and spinning.</p>

<p>In a kind of sick fury, Clyde noticed that Sparser, who was
still with Hortense, was by now holding her close and looking
straight into her eyes. And she was permitting him. It gave him a
feeling of lead at the pit of his stomach. Was it possible she was
beginning to like this young upstart who had this car? And she had
promised to like him for the present. It brought to him a sense of
her fickleness&mdash;the probability of her real indifference to
him. He wanted to do something&mdash;stop dancing and get her away
from Sparser, but there was no use until this particular record ran
out.</p>

<p>And then, just at the end of this, the waiter returned with a
tray and put down cocktails, ginger ale and sandwiches upon three
small tables which had been joined together. All but Sparser and
Hortense quit and came toward it&mdash;a fact which Clyde was quick
to note. She was a heartless flirt! She really did not care for him
after all. And after making him think that she did, so
recently&mdash; and getting him to help her with that coat. She
could go to the devil now. He would show her. And he waiting for
her! Wasn't that the limit? Yet, finally seeing that the others
were gathering about the tables, which had been placed near the
fire, Hortense and Sparser ceased dancing and approached. Clyde was
white and glum. He stood to one side, seemingly indifferent. And
Laura Sipe, who had already noted his rage and understood the
reason now moved away from him to join Tina Kogel, to whom she
explained why he was so angry.</p>

<p>And then noting his glumness, Hortense came over, executing a
phase of the "Grizzly" as she did so.</p>

<p>"Gee, wasn't that swell?" she began. "Gee, how I do love to
dance to music like that!"</p>

<p>"Sure, it's swell for you," returned Clyde, burning with envy
and disappointment.</p>

<p>"Why, what's the trouble?" she asked, in a low and almost
injured tone, pretending not to guess, yet knowing quite well why
he was angry. "You don't mean to say that you're mad because I
danced with him first, do you? Oh, how silly! Why didn't you come
over then and dance with me? I couldn't refuse to dance with him
when he was right there, could I?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, of course, you couldn't," replied Clyde sarcastically,
and in a low, tense tone, for he, no more than Hortense, wanted the
others to hear. "But you didn't have to fall all over him and dream
in his eyes, either, did you?" He was fairly blazing. "You needn't
say you didn't, because I saw you."</p>

<p>At this she glanced at him oddly, realizing not only the
sharpness of his mood, but that this was the first time he had
shown so much daring in connection with her. It must be that he was
getting to feel too sure of her. She was showing him too much
attention. At the same time she realized that this was not the time
to show him that she did not care for him as much as she would like
to have him believe, since she wanted the coat, already agreed
upon.</p>

<p>"Oh, gee, well, ain't that the limit?" she replied angrily, yet
more because she was irritated by the fact that what he said was
true than anything else. "If you aren't the grouch. Well, I can't
help it, if you're going to be as jealous as that. I didn't do
anything but dance with him just a little. I didn't think you'd be
mad." She moved as if to turn away, but realizing that there was an
understanding between them, and that he must be placated if things
were to go on, she drew him by his coat lapels out of the range of
the hearing of the others, who were already looking and listening,
and began.</p>

<p>"Now, see here, you. Don't go acting like this. I didn't mean
anything by what I did. Honest, I didn't. Anyhow, everybody dances
like that now. And nobody means anything by it. Aren't you goin' to
let me be nice to you like I said, or are you?"</p>

<p>And now she looked him coaxingly and winsomely and calculatingly
straight in the eye, as though he were the one person among all
these present whom she really did like. And deliberately, and of a
purpose, she made a pursy, sensuous mouth&mdash;the kind she could
make&mdash; and practised a play of the lips that caused them to
seem to want to kiss him&mdash;a mouth that tempted him to
distraction.</p>

<p>"All right," he said, looking at her weakly and yieldingly. "I
suppose I am a fool, but I saw what you did, all right. You know
I'm crazy about you, Hortense&mdash;just wild! I can't help it. I
wish I could sometimes. I wish I wouldn't be such a fool." And he
looked at her and was sad. And she, realizing her power over him
and how easy it was to bring him around, replied: "Oh,
you&mdash;you don't, either. I'll kiss you after a while, when the
others aren't looking if you'll be good." At the same time she was
conscious of the fact that Sparser's eyes were upon her. Also that
he was intensely drawn to her and that she liked him more than any
one she had recently encountered.</p>

<h3>Chapter 18</h3>

<p>The climax of the afternoon was reached, however, when after
several more dances and drinks, the small river and its
possibilities was again brought to the attention of all by
Hegglund, who, looking out of one of the windows, suddenly
exclaimed: "What's de matter wit de ice down dere? Look at de swell
ice. I dare dis crowd to go down dere and slide."</p>

<p>They were off pell-mell&mdash;Ratterer and Tina Kogel, running
hand in hand, Sparser and Lucille Nickolas, with whom he had just
been dancing, Higby and Laura Sipe, whom he was finding interesting
enough for a change, and Clyde and Hortense. But once on the ice,
which was nothing more than a narrow, winding stream, blown clean
in places by the wind, and curving among thickets of leafless
trees, the company were more like young satyrs and nymphs of an
older day. They ran here and there, slipping and
sliding&mdash;Higby, Lucille and Maida immediately falling down,
but scrambling to their feet with bursts of laughter.</p>

<p>And Hortense, aided by Clyde at first, minced here and there.
But soon she began to run and slide, squealing in pretended fear.
And now, not only Sparser but Higby, and this in spite of Clyde,
began to show Hortense attention. They joined her in sliding, ran
after her and pretended to try to trip her up, but caught her as
she fell. And Sparser, taking her by the hand, dragged her,
seemingly in spite of herself and the others, far upstream and
about a curve where they could not be seen. Determined not to show
further watchfulness or jealousy Clyde remained behind. But he
could not help feeling that Sparser might be taking this occasion
to make a date, even to kiss her. She was not incapable of letting
him, even though she might pretend to him that she did not want him
to. It was agonizing.</p>

<p>In spite of himself, he began to tingle with helpless
pain&mdash;to begin to wish that he could see them. But Hegglund,
having called every one to join hands and crack the whip, he took
the hand of Lucille Nickolas, who was holding on to Hegglund's, and
gave his other free hand to Maida Axelrod, who in turn gave her
free hand to Ratterer. And Higby and Laura Sipe were about to make
up the tail when Sparser and Hortense came gliding back&mdash;he
holding her by the hand. And they now tacked on at the foot. Then
Hegglund and the others began running and doubling back and forth
until all beyond Maida had fallen and let go. And, as Clyde noted,
Hortense and Sparser, in falling, skidded and rolled against each
other to the edge of the shore where were snow and leaves and
twigs. And Hortense's skirts, becoming awry in some way, moved up
to above her knees. But instead of showing any embarrassment, as
Clyde thought and wished she might, she sat there for a few moments
without shame and even laughing heartily&mdash;and Sparser with her
and still holding her hand. And Laura Sipe, having fallen in such a
way as to trip Higby, who had fallen across her, they also lay
there laughing and yet in a most suggestive position, as Clyde
thought. He noted, too, that Laura Sipe's skirts had been worked
above her knees. And Sparser, now sitting up, was pointing to her
pretty legs and laughing loudly, showing most of his teeth. And all
the others were emitting peals and squeals of laughter.</p>

<p>"Hang it all!" thought Clyde. "Why the deuce does he always have
to be hanging about her? Why didn't he bring a girl of his own if
he wanted to have a good time? What right have they got to go where
they can't be seen? And she thinks I think she means nothing by all
this. She never laughs that heartily with me, you bet. What does
she think I am that she can put that stuff over on me, anyhow?" He
glowered darkly for the moment, but in spite of his thoughts the
line or whip was soon re-formed and this time with Lucille Nickolas
still holding his hand. Sparser and Hortense at the tail end again.
But Hegglund, unconscious of the mood of Clyde and thinking only of
the sport, called: "Better let some one else take de end dere,
hadn'tcha?" And feeling the fairness of this, Ratterer and Maida
Axelrod and Clyde and Lucille Nickolas now moved down with Higby
and Laura Sipe and Hortense and Sparser above them. Only, as Clyde
noted, Hortense still held Sparser by the hand, yet she moved just
above him and took his hand, he being to the right, with Sparser
next above to her left, holding her other hand firmly, which
infuriated Clyde. Why couldn't he stick to Laura Sipe, the girl
brought out here for him? And Hortense was encouraging him.</p>

<p>He was very sad, and he felt so angry and bitter that he could
scarcely play the game. He wanted to stop and quarrel with Sparser.
But so brisk and eager was Hegglund that they were off before he
could even think of doing so.</p>

<p>And then, try as he would, to keep his balance in the face of
this, he and Lucille and Ratterer and Maida Axelrod were thrown
down and spun around on the ice like curling irons. And Hortense,
letting go of him at the right moment, seemed to prefer
deliberately to hang on to Sparser. Entangled with these others,
Clyde and they spun across forty feet of smooth, green ice and
piled against a snow bank. At the finish, as he found, Lucille
Nickolas was lying across his knees face down in such a spanking
position that he was compelled to laugh. And Maida Axelrod was on
her back, next to Ratterer, her legs straight up in the air; on
purpose he thought. She was too coarse and bold for him. And there
followed, of course, squeals and guffaws of delight&mdash;so loud
that they could be heard for half a mile. Hegglund, intensely
susceptible to humor at all times, doubled to the knees, slapped
his thighs and bawled. And Sparser opened his big mouth and
chortled and grimaced until he was scarlet. So infectious was the
result that for the time being Clyde forgot his jealousy. He too
looked and laughed. But Clyde's mood had not changed really. He
still felt that she wasn't playing fair.</p>

<p>At the end of all this playing Lucille Nickolas and Tina Kogel
being tired, dropped out. And Hortense, also. Clyde at once left
the group to join her. Ratterer then followed Lucille. Then the
others separating, Hegglund pushed Maida Axelrod before him down
stream out of sight around a bend. Higby, seemingly taking his cue
from this, pulled Tina Kogel up stream, and Ratterer and Lucille,
seeming to see something of interest, struck into a thicket,
laughing and talking as they went. Even Sparser and Laura, left to
themselves, now wandered off, leaving Clyde and Hortense alone.</p>

<p>And then, as these two wandered toward a fallen log which here
paralleled the stream, she sat down. But Clyde, smarting from his
fancied wounds, stood silent for the time being, while she, sensing
as much, took him by the belt of his coat and began to pull at
him.</p>

<p>"Giddap, horsey," she played. "Giddap. My horsey has to skate me
now on the ice."</p>

<p>Clyde looked at her glumly, glowering mentally, and not to be
diverted so easily from the ills which he felt to be his.</p>

<p>"Whadd'ye wanta let that fellow Sparser always hang around you
for?" he demanded. "I saw you going up the creek there with him a
while ago. What did he say to you up there?"</p>

<p>"He didn't say anything."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, of course not," he replied cynically and bitterly. "And
maybe he didn't kiss you, either."</p>

<p>"I should say not," she replied definitely and spitefully, "I'd
like to know what you think I am, anyhow. I don't let people kiss
me the first time they see me, smarty, and I want you to know it. I
didn't let you, did I?"</p>

<p>"Oh, that's all right, too," answered Clyde; "but you didn't
like me as well as you do him, either."</p>

<p>"Oh, didn't I? Well, maybe I didn't, but what right have you to
say I like him, anyhow. I'd like to know if I can't have a little
fun without you watching me all the time. You make me tired, that's
what you do." She was quite angry now because of the proprietary
air he appeared to be assuming.</p>

<p>And now Clyde, repulsed and somewhat shaken by this sudden
counter on her part, decided on the instant that perhaps it might
be best for him to modify his tone. After all, she had never said
that she had really cared for him, even in the face of the implied
promise she had made him.</p>

<p>"Oh, well," he observed glumly after a moment, and not without a
little of sadness in his tone, "I know one thing. If I let on that
I cared for any one as much as you say you do for me at times, I
wouldn't want to flirt around with others like you are doing out
here."</p>

<p>"Oh, wouldn't you?"</p>

<p>"No, I wouldn't."</p>

<p>"Well, who's flirting anyhow, I'd like to know?"</p>

<p>"You are."</p>

<p>"I'm not either, and I wish you'd just go away and let me alone
if you can't do anything but quarrel with me. Just because I danced
with him up there in the restaurant, is no reason for you to think
I'm flirting. Oh, you make me tired, that's what you do,"</p>

<p>"Do I?"</p>

<p>"Yes, you do."</p>

<p>"Well, maybe I better go off and not bother you any more at all
then," he returned, a trace of his mother's courage welling up in
him.</p>

<p>"Well, maybe you had, if that's the way you're going to feel
about me all the time," she answered, and kicked viciously with her
toes at the ice. But Clyde was beginning to feel that he could not
possibly go through with this&mdash;that after all he was too eager
about her&mdash;too much at her feet. He began to weaken and gaze
nervously at her. And she, thinking of her coat again, decided to
be civil.</p>

<p>"You didn't look in his eyes, did you?" he asked weakly, his
thoughts going back to her dancing with Sparser.</p>

<p>"When?"</p>

<p>"When you were dancing with him?"</p>

<p>"No, I didn't, not that I know of, anyhow. But supposing I did.
What of it? I didn't mean anything by it. Gee, criminy, can't a
person look in anybody's eyes if they want to?"</p>

<p>"In the way you looked in his? Not if you claim to like anybody
else, I say." And the skin of Clyde's forehead lifted and sank, and
his eyelids narrowed. Hortense merely clicked impatiently and
indignantly with her tongue.</p>

<p>"Tst! Tst! Tst! If you ain't the limit!"</p>

<p>"And a while ago back there on the ice," went on Clyde
determinedly and yet pathetically. "When you came back from up
there, instead of coming up to where I was you went to the foot of
the line with him. I saw you. And you held his hand, too, all the
way back. And then when you fell down, you had to sit there with
him holding your hand. I'd like to know what you call that if it
ain't flirting. What else is it? I'll bet he thinks it is, all
right."</p>

<p>"Well, I wasn't flirting with him just the same and I don't care
what you say. But if you want to have it that way, have it that
way. I can't stop you. You're so darn jealous you don't want to let
anybody else do anything, that's all the matter with you. How else
can you play on the ice if you don't hold hands, I'd like to know?
Gee, criminy! What about you and that Lucille Nickolas? I saw her
laying across your lap and you laughing. And I didn't think
anything of that. What do you want me to do&mdash;come out here and
sit around like a bump on a log?&mdash;follow you around like a
tail? Or you follow me? What-a-yuh think I am anyhow? A nut?"</p>

<p>She was being ragged by Clyde, as she thought, and she didn't
like it. She was thinking of Sparser who was really more appealing
to her at the time than Clyde. He was more materialistic, less
romantic, more direct.</p>

<p>He turned and, taking off his cap, rubbed his head gloomily
while Hortense, looking at him, thought first of him and then of
Sparser. Sparser was more manly, not so much of a crybaby. He
wouldn't stand around and complain this way, you bet. He'd probably
leave her for good, have nothing more to do with her. Yet Clyde,
after his fashion, was interesting and useful. Who else would do
for her what he had? And at any rate, he was not trying to force
her to go off with him now as these others had gone and as she had
feared he might try to do&mdash;ahead of her plan and wish. This
quarrel was obviating that.</p>

<p>"Now, see here," she said after a time, having decided that it
was best to assuage him and that it was not so hard to manage him
after all. "Are we goin' t'fight all the time, Clyde? What's the
use, anyhow? Whatja want me to come out here for if you just want
to fight with me all the time? I wouldn't have come if I'd 'a'
thought you were going to do that all day."</p>

<p>She turned and kicked at the ice with the minute toe of her
shoes, and Clyde, always taken by her charm again, put his arms
about her, and crushed her to him, at the same time fumbling at her
breasts and putting his lips to hers and endeavoring to hold and
fondle her. But now, because of her suddenly developed liking for
Sparser, and partially because of her present mood towards Clyde,
she broke away, a dissatisfaction with herself and him troubling
her. Why should she let him force her to do anything she did not
feel like doing, just now, anyhow, she now asked herself. She
hadn't agreed to be as nice to him to-day as he might wish. Not
yet. At any rate just now she did not want to be handled in this
way by him, and she would not, regardless of what he might do. And
Clyde, sensing by now what the true state of her mind in regard to
him must be, stepped back and yet continued to gaze gloomily and
hungrily at her. And she in turn merely stared at him.</p>

<p>"I thought you said you liked me," he demanded almost savagely
now, realizing that his dreams of a happy outing this day were
fading into nothing.</p>

<p>"Well, I do when you're nice," she replied, slyly and evasively,
seeking some way to avoid complications in connection with her
original promises to him.</p>

<p>"Yes, you do," he grumbled. "I see how you do. Why, here we are
out here now and you won't even let me touch you. I'd like to know
what you meant by all that you said, anyhow."</p>

<p>"Well, what did I say?" she countered, merely to gain time.</p>

<p>"As though you didn't know."</p>

<p>"Oh, well. But that wasn't to be right away, either, was it? I
thought we said"&mdash;she paused dubiously.</p>

<p>"I know what you said," he went on. "But I notice now that you
don't like me an' that's all there is to it. What difference would
it make if you really cared for me whether you were nice to me now
or next week or the week after? Gee whiz, you'd think it was
something that depended on what I did for you, not whether you
cared for me." In his pain he was quite intense and courageous.</p>

<p>"That's not so!" she snapped, angrily and bitterly, irritated by
the truth of what he said. "And I wish you wouldn't say that to me,
either. I don't care anything about the old coat now, if you want
to know it. And you can just have your old money back, too, I don't
want it. And you can just let me alone from now on, too," she
added. "I'll get all the coats I want without any help from you."
At this, she turned and walked away.</p>

<p>But Clyde, now anxious to mollify her as usual, ran after her.
"Don't go, Hortense," he pleaded. "Wait a minute. I didn't mean
that either, honest I didn't. I'm crazy about you. Honest I am.
Can't you see that? Oh, gee, don't go now. I'm not giving you the
money to get something for it. You can have it for nothing if you
want it that way. There ain't anybody else in the world like you to
me, and there never has been. You can have the money for all I
care, all of it. I don't want it back. But, gee, I did think you
liked me a little. Don't you care for me at all, Hortense?" He
looked cowed and frightened, and she, sensing her mastery over him,
relented a little.</p>

<p>"Of course I do," she announced. "But just the same, that don't
mean that you can treat me any old way, either. You don't seem to
understand that a girl can't do everything you want her to do just
when you want her to do it."</p>

<p>"Just what do you mean by that?" asked Clyde, not quite sensing
just what she did mean. "I don't get you."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, you do, too." She could not believe that he did not
know.</p>

<p>"Oh, I guess I know what you're talkin' about. I know what
you're going to say now," he went on disappointedly. "That's that
old stuff they all pull. I know."</p>

<p>He was reciting almost verbatim the words and intonations even
of the other boys at the hotel&mdash;Higby, Ratterer, Eddie
Doyle&mdash;who, having narrated the nature of such situations to
him, and how girls occasionally lied out of pressing dilemmas in
this way, had made perfectly clear to him what was meant. And
Hortense knew now that he did know.</p>

<p>"Gee, but you're mean," she said in an assumed hurt way. "A
person can never tell you anything or expect you to believe it.
Just the same, it's true, whether you believe it or not."</p>

<p>"Oh, I know how you are," he replied, sadly yet a little
loftily, as though this were an old situation to him. "You don't
like me, that's all. I see that now, all right."</p>

<p>"Gee, but you're mean," she persisted, affecting an injured air.
"It's the God's truth. Believe me or not, I swear it. Honest it
is."</p>

<p>Clyde stood there. In the face of this small trick there was
really nothing much to say as he saw it. He could not force her to
do anything. If she wanted to lie and pretend, he would have to
pretend to believe her. And yet a great sadness settled down upon
him. He was not to win her after all&mdash;that was plain. He
turned, and she, being convinced that he felt that she was lying
now, felt it incumbent upon herself to do something about
it&mdash;to win him around to her again.</p>

<p>"Please, Clyde, please," she began now, most artfully, "I mean
that. Really, I do. Won't you believe me? But I will next week,
sure. Honest, I will. Won't you believe that? I meant everything I
said when I said it. Honest, I did. I do like you&mdash;a lot.
Won't you believe that, too&mdash;please?"</p>

<p>And Clyde, thrilled from head to toe by this latest phase of her
artistry, agreed that he would. And once more he began to smile and
recover his gayety. And by the time they reached the car, to which
they were all called a few minutes after by Hegglund, because of
the time, and he had held her hand and kissed her often, he was
quite convinced that the dream he had been dreaming was as certain
of fulfillment as anything could be. Oh, the glory of it when it
should come true!</p>

<h3>Chapter 19</h3>

<p>For the major portion of the return trip to Kansas City, there
was nothing to mar the very agreeable illusion under which Clyde
rested. He sat beside Hortense, who leaned her head against his
shoulder. And although Sparser, who had waited for the others to
step in before taking the wheel, had squeezed her arm and received
an answering and promising look, Clyde had not seen that.</p>

<p>But the hour being late and the admonitions of Hegglund,
Ratterer and Higby being all for speed, and the mood of Sparser,
because of the looks bestowed upon him by Hortense, being the
gayest and most drunken, it was not long before the outlying lamps
of the environs began to show.</p>

<p>For the car was rushed along the road at break-neck speed. At
one point, however, where one of the eastern trunk lines approached
the city, there was a long and unexpected and disturbing wait at a
grade crossing where two freight trains met and passed. Farther in,
at North Kansas City, it began to snow, great soft slushy flakes,
feathering down and coating the road surface with a slippery layer
of mud which required more caution than had been thus far
displayed. It was then half past five. Ordinarily, an additional
eight minutes at high speed would have served to bring the car
within a block or two of the hotel. But now, with another delay
near Hannibal Bridge owing to grade crossing, it was twenty minutes
to six before the bridge was crossed and Wyandotte Street reached.
And already all four of these youths had lost all sense of the
delight of the trip and the pleasure the companionship of these
girls had given them. For already they were worrying as to the
probability of their reaching the hotel in time. The smug and
martinetish figure of Mr. Squires loomed before them all.</p>

<p>"Gee, if we don't do better than this," observed Ratterer to
Higby, who was nervously fumbling with his watch, "we're not goin'
to make it. We'll hardly have time, as it is, to change."</p>

<p>Clyde, hearing him, exclaimed: "Oh, crickets! I wish we could
hurry a little. Gee, I wish now we hadn't come to-day. It'll be
tough if we don't get there on time."</p>

<p>And Hortense, noting his sudden tenseness and unrest, added:
"Don't you think you'll make it all right?"</p>

<p>"Not this way," he said. But Hegglund, who had been studying the
flaked air outside, a world that seemed dotted with falling bits of
cotton, called: "Eh, dere Willard. We certainly gotta do better dan
dis. It means de razoo for us if we don't get dere on time."</p>

<p>And Higby, for once stirred out of a gambler-like effrontery and
calm, added: "We'll walk the plank all right unless we can put up
some good yarn. Can't anybody think of anything?" As for Clyde, he
merely sighed nervously.</p>

<p>And then, as though to torture them the more, an unexpected
crush of vehicles appeared at nearly every intersection. And
Sparser, who was irritated by this particular predicament, was
contemplating with impatience the warning hand of a traffic
policeman, which, at the intersection of Ninth and Wyandotte, had
been raised against him. "There goes his mit again," he exclaimed.
"What can I do about that! I might turn over to Washington, but I
don't know whether we'll save any time by going over there."</p>

<p>A full minute passed before he was signaled to go forward. Then
swiftly he swung the car to the right and three blocks over into
Washington Street.</p>

<p>But here the conditions were no better. Two heavy lines of
traffic moved in opposite directions. And at each succeeding corner
several precious moments were lost as the cross-traffic went by.
Then the car would tear on to the next corner, weaving its way in
and out as best it could.</p>

<p>At Fifteenth and Washington, Clyde exclaimed to Ratterer: "How
would it do if we got out at Seventeenth and walked over?"</p>

<p>"You won't save any time if I can turn over there," called
Sparser. "I can get over there quicker than you can."</p>

<p>He crowded the other cars for every inch of available space. At
Sixteenth and Washington, seeing what he considered a fairly clear
block to the left, he turned the car and tore along that
thoroughfare to as far as Wyandotte once more. Just as he neared
the corner and was about to turn at high speed, swinging in close
to the curb to do so, a little girl of about nine, who was running
toward the crossing, jumped directly in front of the moving
machine. And because there was no opportunity given him to turn and
avoid her, she was struck and dragged a number of feet before the
machine could be halted. At the same time, there arose piercing
screams from at least half a dozen women, and shouts from as many
men who had witnessed the accident.</p>

<p>Instantly they all rushed toward the child, who had been thrown
under and passed over by the wheels. And Sparser, looking out and
seeing them gathering about the fallen figure, was seized with an
uninterpretable mental panic which conjured up the police, jail,
his father, the owner of the car, severe punishment in many forms.
And though by now all the others in the car were up and giving vent
to anguished exclamations such as "Oh, God! He hit a little girl";
"Oh, gee, he's killed a kid!" "Oh, mercy!" "Oh, Lord!" "Oh,
heavens, what'll we do now?" he turned and exclaimed: "Jesus, the
cops! I gotta get outa this with this car."</p>

<p>And, without consulting the others, who were still half
standing, but almost speechless with fear, he shot the lever into
first, second and then high, and giving the engine all the gas it
would endure, sped with it to the next corner beyond.</p>

<p>But there, as at the other corners in this vicinity, a policeman
was stationed, and having already seen some commotion at the corner
west of him, had already started to leave his post in order to
ascertain what it was. As he did so, cries of "Stop that
car"&mdash; "Stop that car"&mdash;reached his ears. And a man,
running toward the sedan from the scene of the accident, pointed to
it, and called: "Stop that car, stop that car. They've killed a
child."</p>

<p>Then gathering what was meant, he turned toward the car, putting
his police whistle to his mouth as he did so. But Sparser, having
by this time heard the cries and seen the policeman leaving, dashed
swiftly past him into Seventeenth Street, along which he sped at
almost forty miles an hour, grazing the hub of a truck in one
instance, scraping the fender of an automobile in another, and
missing by inches and quarter inches vehicles or pedestrians, while
those behind him in the car were for the most part sitting bolt
upright and tense, their eyes wide, their hands clenched, their
faces and lips set&mdash;or, as in the case of Hortense and Lucille
Nickolas and Tina Kogel, giving voice to repeated, "Oh, Gods!" "Oh,
what's going to happen now?"</p>

<p>But the police and those who had started to pursue were not to
be outdone so quickly. Unable to make out the license plate number
and seeing from the first motions of the car that it had no
intention of stopping, the officer blew a loud and long blast on
his police whistle. And the policeman at the next corner seeing the
car speed by and realizing what it meant, blew on his whistle, then
stopped, and springing on the running board of a passing touring
car ordered it to give chase. And at this, seeing what was amiss or
awind, three other cars, driven by adventurous spirits, joined in
the chase, all honking loudly as they came.</p>

<p>But the Packard had far more speed in it than any of its
pursuers, and although for the first few blocks of the pursuit
there were cries of "Stop that car!" "Stop that car!" still, owing
to the much greater speed of the car, these soon died away, giving
place to the long wild shrieks of distant horns in full cry.</p>

<p>Sparser by now having won a fair lead and realizing that a
straight course was the least baffling to pursue, turned swiftly
into McGee, a comparatively quiet thoroughfare along which he tore
for a few blocks to the wide and winding Gillham Parkway, whose
course was southward. But having followed that at terrific speed
for a short distance, he again&mdash;at Thirty-first&mdash;decided
to turn&mdash;the houses in the distance confusing him and the
suburban country to the north seeming to offer the best opportunity
for evading his pursuers. And so now he swung the car to the left
into that thoroughfare, his thought here being that amid these
comparatively quiet streets it was possible to wind in and out and
so shake off pursuit&mdash;at least long enough to drop his
passengers somewhere and return the car to the garage.</p>

<p>And this he would have been able to do had it not been for the
fact that in turning into one of the more outlying streets of this
region, where there were scarcely any houses and no pedestrians
visible, he decided to turn off his lights, the better to conceal
the whereabouts of the car. Then, still speeding east, north, and
east and south by turns, he finally dashed into one street where,
after a few hundred feet, the pavement suddenly ended. But because
another cross street was visible a hundred feet or so further on,
and he imagined that by turning into that he might find a paved
thoroughfare again, he sped on and then swung sharply to the left,
only to crash roughly into a pile of paving stones left by a
contractor who was preparing to pave the way. In the absence of
lights he had failed to distinguish this. And diagonally opposite
to these, lengthwise of a prospective sidewalk, had been laid a
pile of lumber for a house.</p>

<p>Striking the edge of the paving stones at high speed, he
caromed, and all but upsetting the car, made directly for the
lumber pile opposite, into which he crashed. Only instead of
striking it head on, the car struck one end, causing it to give way
and spread out, but only sufficiently to permit the right wheels to
mount high upon it and so throw the car completely over onto its
left side in the grass and snow beyond the walk. Then there, amid a
crash of glass and the impacts of their own bodies, the occupants
were thrown down in a heap, forward and to the left.</p>

<p>What happened afterwards is more or less of a mystery and a
matter of confusion, not only to Clyde, but to all the others. For
Sparser and Laura Sipe, being in front, were dashed against the
wind-shield and the roof and knocked senseless, Sparser, having his
shoulder, hip and left knee wrenched in such a way as to make it
necessary to let him lie in the car as he was until an ambulance
arrived. He could not possibly be lifted out through the door,
which was in the roof as the car now lay. And in the second seat,
Clyde, being nearest the door to the left and next to him Hortense,
Lucille Nickolas and Ratterer, was pinioned under and yet not
crushed by their combined weights. For Hortense in falling had been
thrown completely over him on her side against the roof, which was
now the left wall. And Lucille, next above her, fell in such a way
as to lie across Clyde's shoulders only, while Ratterer, now
topmost of the four, had, in falling, been thrown over the seat in
front of him. But grasping the steering wheel in front of him as he
fell, the same having been wrenched from Sparser's hands, he had
broken his fall in part by clinging to it. But even so, his face
and hands were cut and bruised and his shoulder, arm and hip
slightly wrenched, yet not sufficiently to prevent his being of
assistance to the others. For at once, realizing the plight of the
others as well as his own, and stirred by their screams, Ratterer
was moved to draw himself up and out through the top or side door
which he now succeeded in opening, scrambling over the others to
reach it.</p>

<p>Once out, he climbed upon the chassis beam of the toppled car,
and, reaching down, caught hold of the struggling and moaning
Lucille, who like the others was trying to climb up but could not.
And exerting all his strength and exclaiming, "Be still, now,
honey, I gotcha. You're all right, I'll getcha out," he lifted her
to a sitting position on the side of the door, then down in the
snow, where he placed her and where she sat crying and feeling her
arms and her head. And after her he helped Hortense, her left cheek
and forehead and both hands badly bruised and bleeding, but not
seriously, although she did not know that at the time. She was
whimpering and shivering and shaking&mdash;a nervous chill having
succeeded the dazed and almost unconscious state which had followed
the first crash.</p>

<p>At that moment, Clyde, lifting his bewildered head above the
side door of the car, his left cheek, shoulder and arm bruised, but
not otherwise injured, was thinking that he too must get out of
this as quickly as possible. A child had been killed; a car stolen
and wrecked; his job was most certainly lost; the police were in
pursuit and might even find them there at any minute. And below him
in the car was Sparser, prone where he fell, but already being
looked to by Ratterer. And beside him Laura Sipe, also unconscious.
He felt called upon to do something&mdash;to assist Ratterer, who
was reaching down and trying to lay hold of Laura Sipe without
injuring her. But so confused were his thoughts that he would have
stood there without helping any one had it not been for Ratterer,
who called most irritably, "Give us a hand here, Clyde, will you?
Let's see if we can get her out. She's fainted." And Clyde, turning
now instead of trying to climb out, began to seek to lift her from
within, standing on the broken glass window of the side beneath his
feet and attempting to draw her body back and up off the body of
Sparser. But this was not possible. She was too limp&mdash;too
heavy. He could only draw her back&mdash;off the body of
Sparser&mdash;and then let her rest there, between the second and
first seats on the car's side.</p>

<p>But, meanwhile, at the back Hegglund, being nearest the top and
only slightly stunned, had managed to reach the door nearest him
and throw it back. Thus, by reason of his athletic body, he was
able to draw himself up and out, saying as he did so: "Oh, Jesus,
what a finish! Oh, Christ, dis is de limit! Oh, Jesus, we better
beat it outa dis before de cops git here."</p>

<p>At the same time, however, seeing the others below him and
hearing their cries, he could not contemplate anything so desperate
as desertion. Instead, once out, he turned and making out Maida
below him, exclaimed: "Here, for Christ's sake, gimme your hand. We
gotta get outa dis and dam quick, I tell ya." Then turning from
Maida, who for the moment was feeling her wounded and aching head,
he mounted the top chassis beam again and, reaching down, caught
hold of Tina Kogel, who, only stunned, was trying to push herself
to a sitting position while resting heavily on top of Higby. But
he, relieved of the weight of the others, was already kneeling, and
feeling his head and face with his hands.</p>

<p>"Gimme your hand, Dave," called Hegglund. "Hurry! For Christ's
sake! We ain't got no time to lose around here. Are ya hurt?
Christ, we gotta git outa here, I tellya. I see a guy comin' acrost
dere now an' I doughno wedder he's a cop or not." He started to lay
hold of Higby's left hand, but as he did so Higby repulsed him.</p>

<p>"Huh, uh," he exclaimed. "Don't pull. I'm all right. I'll get
out by myself. Help the others." And standing up, his head above
the level of the door, he began to look about within the car for
something on which to place his foot. The back cushion having
fallen out and forward, he got his foot on that and raised himself
up to the door level on which he sat and drew out his leg. Then
looking about, and seeing Hegglund attempting to assist Ratterer
and Clyde with Sparser, he went to their aid.</p>

<p>Outside, some odd and confusing incidents had already occurred.
For Hortense, who had been lifted out before Clyde, and had
suddenly begun to feel her face, had as suddenly realized that her
left cheek and forehead were not only scraped but bleeding. And
being seized by the notion that her beauty might have been
permanently marred by this accident, she was at once thrown into a
state of selfish panic which caused her to become completely
oblivious, not only to the misery and injury of the others, but to
the danger of discovery by the police, the injury to the child, the
wreck of this expensive car&mdash;in fact everything but herself
and the probability or possibility that her beauty had been
destroyed. She began to whimper on the instant and wave her hands
up and down. "Oh, goodness, goodness, goodness!" she exclaimed
desperately. "Oh, how dreadful! Oh, how terrible! Oh, my face is
all cut." And feeling an urgent compulsion to do something about
it, she suddenly set off (and without a word to any one and while
Clyde was still inside helping Ratterer) south along 35th Street,
toward the city where were lights and more populated streets. Her
one thought was to reach her own home as speedily as possible in
order that she might do something for herself.</p>

<p>Of Clyde, Sparser, Ratterer and the other girls&mdash;she really
thought nothing. What were they now? It was only intermittently and
between thoughts of her marred beauty that she could even bring
herself to think of the injured child&mdash;the horror of which as
well as the pursuit by the police, maybe, the fact that the car did
not belong to Sparser or that it was wrecked, and that they were
all liable to arrest in consequence, affecting her but slightly.
Her one thought in regard to Clyde was that he was the one who had
invited her to this ill-fated journey&mdash;hence that he was to
blame, really. Those beastly boys&mdash;to think they should have
gotten her into this and then didn't have brains enough to manage
better.</p>

<p>The other girls, apart from Laura Sipe, were not seriously
injured&mdash; any of them. They were more frightened than anything
else, but now that this had happened they were in a panic, lest
they be overtaken by the police, arrested, exposed and punished.
And accordingly they stood about, exclaiming "Oh, gee, hurry, can't
you? Oh, dear, we ought all of us to get away from here. Oh, it's
all so terrible." Until at last Hegglund exclaimed: "For Christ's
sake, keep quiet, cantcha? We're doing de best we can, cantcha see?
You'll have de cops down on us in a minute as it is."</p>

<p>And then, as if in answer to his comment, a lone suburbanite who
lived some four blocks from the scene across the fields and who,
hearing the crash and the cries in the night, had ambled across to
see what the trouble was, now drew near and stood curiously looking
at the stricken group and the car.</p>

<p>"Had an accident, eh?" he exclaimed, genially enough. "Any one
badly hurt? Gee, that's too bad. And that's a swell car, too. Can I
help any?"</p>

<p>Clyde, hearing him talk and looking out and not seeing Hortense
anywhere, and not being able to do more for Sparser than stretch
him in the bottom of the car, glanced agonizingly about. For the
thought of the police and their certain pursuit was strong upon
him. He must get out of this. He must not be caught here. Think of
what would happen to him if he were caught&mdash;how he would be
disgraced and punished probably&mdash;all his fine world stripped
from him before he could say a word really. His mother would
hear&mdash;Mr. Squires&mdash;everybody. Most certainly he would go
to jail. Oh, how terrible that thought was&mdash;grinding really
like a macerating wheel to his flesh. They could do nothing more
for Sparser, and they only laid themselves open to being caught by
lingering. So asking, "Where'd Miss Briggs go?" he now began to
climb out, then started looking about the dark and snowy fields for
her. His thought was that he would first assist her to wherever she
might desire to go.</p>

<p>But just then in the distance was heard the horns and the hum of
at least two motorcycles speeding swiftly in the direction of this
very spot. For already the wife of the suburbanite, on hearing the
crash and the cries in the distance, had telephoned the police that
an accident had occurred here. And now the suburbanite was
explaining: "That's them. I told the wife to telephone for an
ambulance." And hearing this, all these others now began to run,
for they all realized what that meant. And in addition, looking
across the fields one could see the lights of these approaching
machines. They reached Thirty-first and Cleveland together. Then
one turned south toward this very spot, along Cleveland Avenue. And
the other continued east on Thirty-first, reconnoitering for the
accident.</p>

<p>"Beat it, for God's sake, all of youse," whispered Hegglund,
excitedly. "Scatter!" And forthwith, seizing Maida Axelrod by the
hand, he started to run east along Thirty-fifth Street, in which
the car then lay&mdash;along the outlying eastern suburbs. But
after a moment, deciding that that would not do either, that it
would be too easy to pursue him along a street, he cut northeast,
directly across the open fields and away from the city.</p>

<p>And now, Clyde, as suddenly sensing what capture would
mean&mdash;how all his fine thoughts of pleasure would most
certainly end in disgrace and probably prison, began running also.
Only in his case, instead of following Hegglund or any of the
others, he turned south along Cleveland Avenue toward the southern
limits of the city. But like Hegglund, realizing that that meant an
easy avenue of pursuit for any one who chose to follow, he too took
to the open fields. Only instead of running away from the city as
before, he now turned southwest and ran toward those streets which
lay to the south of Fortieth. Only much open space being before him
before he should reach them, and a clump of bushes showing in the
near distance, and the light of the motorcycle already sweeping the
road behind him, he ran to that and for the moment dropped behind
it.</p>

<p>Only Sparser and Laura Sipe were left within the car, she at
that moment beginning to recover consciousness. And the visiting
stranger, much astounded, was left standing outside.</p>

<p>"Why, the very idea!" he suddenly said to himself. "They must
have stolen that car. It couldn't have belonged to them at
all."</p>

<p>And just then the first motorcycle reaching the scene, Clyde
from his not too distant hiding place was able to overhear. "Well,
you didn't get away with it after all, did you? You thought you
were pretty slick, but you didn't make it. You're the one we want,
and what's become of the rest of the gang, eh? Where are they,
eh?"</p>

<p>And hearing the suburbanite declare quite definitely that he had
nothing to do with it, that the real occupants of the car had but
then run away and might yet be caught if the police wished, Clyde,
who was still within earshot of what was being said, began crawling
upon his hands and knees at first in the snow south, south and
west, always toward some of those distant streets which, lamplit
and faintly glowing, he saw to the southwest of him, and among
which presently, if he were not captured, he hoped to hide&mdash;to
lose himself and so escape&mdash;if the fates were only
kind&mdash;the misery and the punishment and the unending
dissatisfaction and disappointment which now, most definitely, it
all represented to him.</p>

<h2>BOOK TWO</h2>

<h3>Chapter 1</h3>

<p>The home of Samuel Griffiths in Lycurgus, New York, a city of
some twenty-five thousand inhabitants midway between Utica and
Albany. Near the dinner hour and by degrees the family assembling
for its customary meal. On this occasion the preparations were of a
more elaborate nature than usual, owing to the fact that for the
past four days Mr. Samuel Griffiths, the husband and father, had
been absent attending a conference of shirt and collar
manufacturers in Chicago, price-cutting by upstart rivals in the
west having necessitated compromise and adjustment by those who
manufactured in the east. He was but now returned and had
telephoned earlier in the afternoon that he had arrived, and was
going to his office in the factory where he would remain until
dinner time.</p>

<p>Being long accustomed to the ways of a practical and convinced
man who believed in himself and considered his judgment and his
decision sound&mdash;almost final&mdash;for the most part, anyhow,
Mrs. Griffiths thought nothing of this. He would appear and greet
her in due order.</p>

<p>Knowing that he preferred leg of lamb above many other things,
after due word with Mrs. Truesdale, her homely but useful
housekeeper, she ordered lamb. And the appropriate vegetables and
dessert having been decided upon, she gave herself over to thoughts
of her eldest daughter Myra, who, having graduated from Smith
College several years before, was still unmarried. And the reason
for this, as Mrs. Griffiths well understood, though she was never
quite willing to admit it openly, was that Myra was not very good
looking. Her nose was too long, her eyes too close-set, her chin
not sufficiently rounded to give her a girlish and pleasing
appearance. For the most part she seemed too thoughtful and
studious&mdash;as a rule not interested in the ordinary social life
of that city. Neither did she possess that savoir faire, let alone
that peculiar appeal for men, that characterized some girls even
when they were not pretty. As her mother saw it, she was really too
critical and too intellectual, having a mind that was rather above
the world in which she found herself.</p>

<p>Brought up amid comparative luxury, without having to worry
about any of the rough details of making a living, she had been
confronted, nevertheless, by the difficulties of making her own way
in the matter of social favor and love&mdash;two objectives which,
without beauty or charm, were about as difficult as the attaining
to extreme wealth by a beggar. And the fact that for twelve years
now&mdash;ever since she had been fourteen&mdash;she had seen the
lives of other youths and maidens in this small world in which she
moved passing gayly enough, while hers was more or less confined to
reading, music, the business of keeping as neatly and attractively
arrayed as possible, and of going to visit friends in the hope of
possibly encountering somewhere, somehow, the one temperament who
would be interested in her, had saddened, if not exactly soured
her. And that despite the fact that the material comfort of her
parents and herself was exceptional.</p>

<p>Just now she had gone through her mother's room to her own,
looking as though she were not very much interested in anything.
Her mother had been trying to think of something to suggest that
would take her out of herself, when the younger daughter, Bella,
fresh from a passing visit to the home of the Finchleys, wealthy
neighbors where she had stopped on her way from the Snedeker
School, burst in upon her.</p>

<p>Contrasted with her sister, who was tall and dark and rather
sallow, Bella, though shorter, was far more gracefully and
vigorously formed. She had thick brown&mdash;almost
black&mdash;hair, a brown and olive complexion tinted with red, and
eyes brown and genial, that blazed with an eager, seeking light. In
addition to her sound and lithe physique, she possessed vitality
and animation. Her arms and legs were graceful and active. Plainly
she was given to liking things as she found them&mdash;enjoying
life as it was&mdash;and hence, unlike her sister, she was
unusually attractive to men and boys&mdash;to men and women, old
and young&mdash;a fact which her mother and father well knew. No
danger of any lack of marriage offers for her when the time came.
As her mother saw it, too many youths and men were already buzzing
around, and so posing the question of a proper husband for her.
Already she had displayed a tendency to become thick and fast
friends, not only with the scions of the older and more
conservative families who constituted the ultra-respectable element
of the city, but also, and this was more to her mother's distaste,
with the sons and daughters of some of those later and hence
socially less important families of the region&mdash;the sons and
daughters of manufacturers of bacon, canning jars, vacuum cleaners,
wooden and wicker ware, and typewriters, who constituted a solid
enough financial element in the city, but who made up what might be
considered the "fast set" in the local life.</p>

<p>In Mrs. Griffiths' opinion, there was too much dancing,
cabareting, automobiling to one city and another, without due
social supervision. Yet, as a contrast to her sister, Myra, what a
relief. It was only from the point of view of proper surveillance,
or until she was safely and religiously married, that Mrs.
Griffiths troubled or even objected to most of her present contacts
and yearnings and gayeties. She desired to protect her.</p>

<p>"Now, where have you been?" she demanded, as her daughter burst
into the room, throwing down her books and drawing near to the open
fire that burned there.</p>

<p>"Just think, Mamma," began Bella most unconcernedly and almost
irrelevantly. "The Finchleys are going to give up their place out
at Greenwood Lake this coming summer and go up to Twelfth Lake near
Pine Point. They're going to build a new bungalow up there. And
Sondra says that this time it's going to be right down at the
water's edge&mdash;not away from it, as it is out here. And they're
going to have a great big verandah with a hardwood floor. And a
boathouse big enough for a thirty-foot electric launch that Mr.
Finchley is going to buy for Stuart. Won't that be wonderful? And
she says that if you will let me, that I can come up there for all
summer long, or for as long as I like. And Gil, too, if he will.
It's just across the lake from the Emery Lodge, you know, and the
East Gate Hotel. And the Phants' place, you know, the Phants of
Utica, is just below theirs near Sharon. Isn't that just wonderful?
Won't that be great? I wish you and Dad would make up your minds to
build up there now sometime, Mamma. It looks to me now as though
nearly everybody that's worth anything down here is moving up
there."</p>

<p>She talked so fast and swung about so, looking now at the open
fire burning in the grate, then out of the two high windows that
commanded the front lawn and a full view of Wykeagy Avenue, lit by
the electric lights in the winter dusk, that her mother had no
opportunity to insert any comment until this was over. However, she
managed to observe: "Yes? Well, what about the Anthonys and the
Nicholsons and the Taylors? I haven't heard of their leaving
Greenwood yet."</p>

<p>"Oh, I know, not the Anthonys or the Nicholsons or the Taylors.
Who expects them to move? They're too old fashioned. They're not
the kind that would move anywhere, are they? No one thinks they
are. Just the same Greenwood isn't like Twelfth Lake. You know that
yourself. And all the people that are anybody down on the South
Shore are going up there for sure. The Cranstons next year, Sondra
says. And after that, I bet the Harriets will go, too."</p>

<p>"The Cranstons and the Harriets and the Finchleys and Sondra,"
commented her mother, half amused and half irritated. "The
Cranstons and you and Bertine and Sondra&mdash;that's all I hear
these days." For the Cranstons, and the Finchleys, despite a
certain amount of local success in connection with this newer and
faster set, were, much more than any of the others, the subject of
considerable unfavorable comment. They were the people who, having
moved the Cranston Wickwire Company from Albany, and the Finchley
Electric Sweeper from Buffalo, and built large factories on the
south bank of the Mohawk River, to say nothing of new and grandiose
houses in Wykeagy Avenue and summer cottages at Greenwood, some
twenty miles northwest, were setting a rather showy, and hence
disagreeable, pace to all of the wealthy residents of this region.
They were given to wearing the smartest clothes, to the latest
novelties in cars and entertainments, and constituted a problem to
those who with less means considered their position and their
equipment about as fixed and interesting and attractive as such
things might well be. The Cranstons and the Finchleys were in the
main a thorn in the flesh of the remainder of the elite of
Lycurgus&mdash;too showy and too aggressive.</p>

<p>"How often have I told you that I don't want you to have so much
to do with Bertine or that Letta Harriet or her brother either?
They're too forward. They run around and talk and show off too
much. And your father feels the same as I do in regard to them. As
for Sondra Finchley, if she expects to go with Bertine and you,
too, then you're not going to go with her either much longer.
Besides I'm not sure that your father approves of your going
anywhere without some one to accompany you. You're not old enough
yet. And as for your going to Twelfth Lake to the Finchleys, well,
unless we all go together, there'll be no going there, either." And
now Mrs. Griffiths, who leaned more to the manner and tactics of
the older, if not less affluent families, stared complainingly at
her daughter.</p>

<p>Nevertheless Bella was no more abashed that she was irritated by
this. On the contrary she knew her mother and knew that she was
fond of her; also that she was intrigued by her physical charm as
well as her assured local social success as much as was her father,
who considered her perfection itself and could be swayed by her
least, as well as her much practised, smile.</p>

<p>"Not old enough, not old enough," commented Bella reproachfully.
"Will you listen? I'll be eighteen in July. I'd like to know when
you and Papa are going to think I'm old enough to go anywhere
without you both. Wherever you two go, I have to go, and wherever I
want to go, you two have to go, too."</p>

<p>"Bella," censured her mother. Then after a moment's silence, in
which her daughter stood there impatiently, she added, "Of course,
what else would you have us do? When you are twenty-one or two, if
you are not married by then, it will be time enough to think of
going off by yourself. But at your age, you shouldn't be thinking
of any such thing." Bella cocked her pretty head, for at the moment
the side door downstairs was thrown open, and Gilbert Griffiths,
the only son of this family and who very much in face and build, if
not in manner or lack of force, resembled Clyde, his western
cousin, entered and ascended.</p>

<p>He was at this time a vigorous, self-centered and vain youth of
twenty-three who, in contrast with his two sisters, seemed much
sterner and far more practical. Also, probably much more
intelligent and aggressive in a business way&mdash;a field in which
neither of the two girls took the slightest interest. He was brisk
in manner and impatient. He considered that his social position was
perfectly secure, and was utterly scornful of anything but
commercial success. Yet despite this he was really deeply
interested in the movements of the local society, of which he
considered himself and his family the most important part. Always
conscious of the dignity and social standing of his family in this
community, he regulated his action and speech accordingly.
Ordinarily he struck the passing observer as rather sharp and
arrogant, neither as youthful or as playful as his years might have
warranted. Still he was young, attractive and interesting. He had a
sharp, if not brilliant, tongue in his head&mdash;a gift at times
for making crisp and cynical remarks. On account of his family and
position he was considered also the most desirable of all the young
eligible bachelors in Lycurgus. Nevertheless he was so much
interested in himself that he scarcely found room in his cosmos for
a keen and really intelligent understanding of anyone else.</p>

<p>Hearing him ascend from below and enter his room, which was at
the rear of the house next to hers, Bella at once left her mother's
room, and coming to the door, called: "Oh, Gil, can I come in?"</p>

<p>"Sure." He was whistling briskly and already, in view of some
entertainment somewhere, preparing to change to evening
clothes.</p>

<p>"Where are you going?"</p>

<p>"Nowhere, for dinner. To the Wynants afterwards."</p>

<p>"Oh, Constance to be sure."</p>

<p>"No, not Constance, to be sure. Where do you get that
stuff?"</p>

<p>"As though I didn't know."</p>

<p>"Lay off. Is that what you came in here for?"</p>

<p>"No, that isn't what I came in here for. What do you think? The
Finchleys are going to build a place up at Twelfth Lake next
summer, right on the lake, next to the Phants, and Mr. Finchley's
going to buy Stuart a thirty-foot launch and build a boathouse with
a sun-parlor right over the water to hold it. Won't that be swell,
huh?"</p>

<p>"Don't say 'swell.' And don't say 'huh.' Can't you learn to cut
out the slang? You talk like a factory girl. Is that all they teach
you over at that school?"</p>

<p>"Listen to who's talking about cutting out slang. How about
yourself? You set a fine example around here, I notice."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm five years older than you are. Besides I'm a man. You
don't notice Myra using any of that stuff."</p>

<p>"Oh, Myra. But don't let's talk about that. Only think of that
new house they're going to build and the fine time they're going to
have up there next summer. Don't you wish we could move up there,
too? We could if we wanted to&mdash;if Papa and Mamma would agree
to it."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know that it would be so wonderful," replied her
brother, who was really very much interested just the same. "There
are other places besides Twelfth Lake."</p>

<p>"Who said there weren't? But not for the people that we know
around here. Where else do the best people from Albany and Utica go
but there now, I'd like to know. It's going to become a regular
center, Sondra says, with all the finest houses along the west
shore. Just the same, the Cranstons, the Lamberts, and the Harriets
are going to move up there pretty soon, too," Bella added most
definitely and defiantly. "That won't leave so many out at
Greenwood Lake, nor the very best people, either, even if the
Anthonys and Nicholsons do stay here."</p>

<p>"Who says the Cranstons are going up there?" asked Gilbert, now
very much interested.</p>

<p>"Why, Sondra!"</p>

<p>"Who told her?"</p>

<p>"Bertine."</p>

<p>"Gee, they're getting gayer and gayer," commented her brother
oddly and a little enviously. "Pretty soon Lycurgus'll be too small
to hold 'em." He jerked at a bow tie he was attempting to center
and grimaced oddly as his tight neck-band pinched him slightly.</p>

<p>For although Gilbert had recently entered into the collar and
shirt industry with his father as general supervisor of
manufacturing, and with every prospect of managing and controlling
the entire business eventually, still he was jealous of young Grant
Cranston, a youth of his own age, very appealing and attractive
physically, who was really more daring with and more attractive to
the girls of the younger set. Cranston seemed to be satisfied that
it was possible to combine a certain amount of social pleasure with
working for his father with which Gilbert did not agree. In fact,
young Griffiths would have preferred, had it been possible, so to
charge young Cranston with looseness, only thus far the latter had
managed to keep himself well within the bounds of sobriety. And the
Cranston Wickwire Company was plainly forging ahead as one of the
leading industries of Lycurgus.</p>

<p>"Well," he added, after a moment, "they're spreading out faster
than I would if I had their business. They're not the richest
people in the world, either." Just the same he was thinking that,
unlike himself and his parents, the Cranstons were really more
daring if not socially more avid of life. He envied them.</p>

<p>"And what's more," added Bella interestedly, "the Finchleys are
to have a dance floor over the boathouse. And Sondra says that
Stuart was hoping that you would come up there and spend a lot of
time this summer."</p>

<p>"Oh, did he?" replied Gilbert, a little enviously and
sarcastically. "You mean he said he was hoping you would come up
and spend a lot of time. I'll be working this summer."</p>

<p>"He didn't say anything of the kind, smarty. Besides it wouldn't
hurt us any if we did go up there. There's nothing much out at
Greenwood any more that I can see. A lot of old hen parties."</p>

<p>"Is that so? Mother would like to hear that."</p>

<p>"And you'll tell her, of course"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, I won't either. But I don't think we're going to follow
the Finchleys or the Cranstons up to Twelfth Lake just yet, either.
You can go up there if you want, if Dad'll let you."</p>

<p>Just then the lower door clicked again, and Bella, forgetting
her quarrel with her brother, ran down to greet her father.</p>

<h3>Chapter 2</h3>

<p>The head of the Lycurgus branch of the Griffiths, as contrasted
with the father of the Kansas City family, was most arresting.
Unlike his shorter and more confused brother of the Door of Hope,
whom he had not even seen for thirty years, he was a little above
the average in height, very well-knit, although comparatively
slender, shrewd of eye, and incisive both as to manner and speech.
Long used to contending for himself, and having come by effort as
well as results to know that he was above the average in acumen and
commercial ability, he was inclined at times to be a bit intolerant
of those who were not. He was not ungenerous or unpleasant in
manner, but always striving to maintain a calm and judicial air.
And he told himself by way of excuse for his mannerisms that he was
merely accepting himself at the value that others placed upon him
and all those who, like himself, were successful.</p>

<p>Having arrived in Lycurgus about twenty-five years before with
some capital and a determination to invest in a new collar
enterprise which had been proposed to him, he had succeeded
thereafter beyond his wildest expectations. And naturally he was
vain about it. His family at this time&mdash;twenty-five years
later&mdash;unquestionably occupied one of the best, as well as the
most tastefully constructed residences in Lycurgus. They were also
esteemed as among the few best families of this region&mdash;being,
if not the oldest, at least among the most conservative,
respectable and successful in Lycurgus. His two younger children,
if not the eldest, were much to the front socially in the younger
and gayer set and so far nothing had happened to weaken or darken
his prestige.</p>

<p>On returning from Chicago on this particular day, after having
concluded several agreements there which spelled trade harmony and
prosperity for at least one year, he was inclined to feel very much
at ease and on good terms with the world. Nothing had occurred to
mar his trip. In his absence the Griffiths Collar and Shirt Company
had gone on as though he had been present. Trade orders at the
moment were large.</p>

<p>Now as he entered his own door he threw down a heavy bag and
fashionably made coat and turned to see what he rather
expected&mdash; Bella hurrying toward him. Indeed she was his pet,
the most pleasing and different and artistic thing, as he saw it,
that all his years had brought to him&mdash;youth, health, gayety,
intelligence and affection&mdash;all in the shape of a pretty
daughter.</p>

<p>"Oh, Daddy," she called most sweetly and enticingly as she saw
him enter. "Is that you?"</p>

<p>"Yes. At least it feels a little like me at the present moment.
How's my baby girl?" And he opened his arms and received the
bounding form of his last born. "There's a good, strong, healthy
girl, I'll say," he announced as he withdrew his affectionate lips
from hers. "And how's the bad girl been behaving herself since I
left? No fibbing this time."</p>

<p>"Oh, just fine, Daddy. You can ask any one. I couldn't be
better."</p>

<p>"And your mother?"</p>

<p>"She's all right, Daddy. She's up in her room. I don't think she
heard you come in."</p>

<p>"And Myra? Is she back from Albany yet?"</p>

<p>"Yes. She's in her room. I heard her playing just now. I just
got in myself a little while ago."</p>

<p>"Ay, hai. Gadding about again. I know you." He held up a genial
forefinger, warningly, while Bella swung onto one of his arms and
kept pace with him up the stairs to the floor above.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, I wasn't either, now," she cooed shrewdly and sweetly.
"Just see how you pick on me, Daddy. I was only over with Sondra
for a little while. And what do you think, Daddy? They're going to
give up the place at Greenwood and build a big handsome bungalow up
on Twelfth Lake right away. And Mr. Finchley's going to buy a big
electric launch for Stuart and they're going to live up there next
summer, maybe all the time, from May until October. And so are the
Cranstons, maybe."</p>

<p>Mr. Griffiths, long used to his younger daughter's wiles, was
interested at the moment not so much by the thought that she wished
to convey&mdash;that Twelfth Lake was more desirable, socially than
Greenwood&mdash;as he was by the fact that the Finchleys were able
to make this sudden and rather heavy expenditure for social reasons
only.</p>

<p>Instead of answering Bella he went on upstairs and into his
wife's room. He kissed Mrs. Griffiths, looked in upon Myra, who
came to the door to embrace him, and spoke of the successful nature
of the trip. One could see by the way he embraced his wife that
there was an agreeable understanding between them&mdash;no
disharmony&mdash;by the way he greeted Myra that if he did not
exactly sympathize with her temperament and point of view, at least
he included her within the largess of his affection.</p>

<p>As they were talking Mrs. Truesdale announced that dinner was
ready, and Gilbert, having completed his toilet, now entered.</p>

<p>"I say, Dad," he called, "I have an interesting thing I want to
see you about in the morning. Can I?"</p>

<p>"All right, I'll be there. Come in about noon."</p>

<p>"Come on all, or the dinner will be getting cold," admonished
Mrs. Griffiths earnestly, and forthwith Gilbert turned and went
down, followed by Griffiths, who still had Bella on his arm. And
after him came Mrs. Griffiths and Myra, who now emerged from her
room and joined them.</p>

<p>Once seated at the table, the family forthwith began discussing
topics of current local interest. For Bella, who was the family's
chief source of gossip, gathering the most of it from the Snedeker
School, through which all the social news appeared to percolate
most swiftly, suddenly announced: "What do you think, Mamma?
Rosetta Nicholson, that niece of Mrs. Disston Nicholson, who was
over here last summer from Albany&mdash;you know, she came over the
night of the Alumnae Garden Party on our lawn&mdash;you
remember&mdash;the young girl with the yellow hair and squinty blue
eyes&mdash;her father owns that big wholesale grocery over
there&mdash;well, she's engaged to that Herbert Tickham of Utica,
who was visiting Mrs. Lambert last summer. You don't remember him,
but I do. He was tall and dark and sorta awkward, and awfully pale,
but very handsome&mdash;oh, a regular movie hero."</p>

<p>"There you go, Mrs. Griffiths," interjected Gilbert shrewdly and
cynically to his mother. "A delegation from the Misses Snedeker's
Select School sneaks off to the movies to brush up on heroes from
time to time."</p>

<p>Griffiths senior suddenly observed: "I had a curious experience
in Chicago this time, something I think the rest of you will be
interested in." He was thinking of an accidental encounter two days
before in Chicago between himself and the eldest son, as it proved
to be, of his younger brother Asa. Also of a conclusion he had come
to in regard to him.</p>

<p>"Oh, what is it, Daddy?" pleaded Bella at once. "Do tell me
about it."</p>

<p>"Spin the big news, Dad," added Gilbert, who, because of the
favor of his father, felt very free and close to him always.</p>

<p>"Well, while I was in Chicago at the Union League Club, I met a
young man who is related to us, a cousin of you three children, by
the way, the eldest son of my brother Asa, who is out in Denver
now, I understand. I haven't seen or heard from him in thirty
years." He paused and mused dubiously.</p>

<p>"Not the one who is a preacher somewhere, Daddy?" inquired
Bella, looking up.</p>

<p>"Yes, the preacher. At least I understand he was for a while
after he left home. But his son tells me he has given that up now.
He's connected with something in Denver&mdash;a hotel, I
think."</p>

<p>"But what's his son like?" interrogated Bella, who only knew
such well groomed and ostensibly conservative youths and men as her
present social status and supervision permitted, and in consequence
was intensely interested. The son of a western hotel
proprietor!</p>

<p>"A cousin? How old is he?" asked Gilbert instantly, curious as
to his character and situation and ability.</p>

<p>"Well, he's a very interesting young man, I think," continued
Griffiths tentatively and somewhat dubiously, since up to this hour
he had not truly made up his mind about Clyde. "He's quite
good-looking and well-mannered, too&mdash;about your own age, I
should say, Gil, and looks a lot like you&mdash;very much
so&mdash;same eyes and mouth and chin." He looked at his son
examiningly. "He's a little bit taller, if anything, and looks a
little thinner, though I don't believe he really is."</p>

<p>At the thought of a cousin who looked like him&mdash;possibly as
attractive in every way as himself&mdash;and bearing his own name,
Gilbert chilled and bristled slightly. For here in Lycurgus, up to
this time, he was well and favourably known as the only son and
heir presumptive to the managerial control of his father's
business, and to at least a third of the estate, if not more. And
now, if by any chance it should come to light that there was a
relative, a cousin of his own years and one who looked and acted
like him, even&mdash;he bridled at the thought. Forthwith (a
psychic reaction which he did not understand and could not very
well control) he decided that he did not like him&mdash;could not
like him.</p>

<p>"What's he doing now?" he asked in a curt and rather sour tone,
though he attempted to avoid the latter element in his voice.</p>

<p>"Well, he hasn't much of a job, I must say," smiled Samuel
Griffiths, meditatively. "He's only a bell-hop in the Union League
Club in Chicago, at present, but a very pleasant and gentlemanly
sort of a boy, I will say. I was quite taken with him. In fact,
because he told me there wasn't much opportunity for advancement
where he was, and that he would like to get into something where
there was more chance to do something and be somebody, I told him
that if he wanted to come on here and try his luck with us, we
might do a little something for him&mdash;give him a chance to show
what he could do, at least."</p>

<p>He had not intended to set forth at once the fact that he became
interested in his nephew to this extent, but&mdash;rather to wait
and thrash it out at different times with both his wife and son,
but the occasion having seemed to offer itself, he had spoken. And
now that he had, he felt rather glad of it, for because Clyde so
much resembled Gilbert he did want to do a little something for
him.</p>

<p>But Gilbert bristled and chilled, the while Bella and Myra, if
not Mrs. Griffiths, who favored her only son in
everything&mdash;even to preferring him to be without a blood
relation or other rival of any kind, rather warmed to the idea. A
cousin who was a Griffiths and good-looking and about Gilbert's
age&mdash;and who, as their father reported, was rather pleasant
and well-mannered&mdash;that pleased Bella and Myra while Mrs.
Griffiths, noting Gilbert's face darken, was not so moved. He would
not like him. But out of respect for her husband's authority and
general ability in all things, she now remained silent. But not so,
Bella.</p>

<p>"Oh, you're going to give him a place, are you, Dad?" she
commented. "That's interesting. I hope he's better-looking than the
rest of our cousins."</p>

<p>"Bella," chided Mrs. Griffiths, while Myra, recalling a gauche
uncle and cousin who had come on from Vermont several years before
to visit them a few days, smiled wisely. At the same time Gilbert,
deeply irritated, was mentally fighting against the idea. He could
not see it at all. "Of course we're not turning away applicants who
want to come in and learn the business right along now, as it is,"
he said sharply.</p>

<p>"Oh, I know," replied his father, "but not cousins and nephews
exactly. Besides he looks very intelligent and ambitious to me. It
wouldn't do any great harm if we let at least one of our relatives
come here and show what he can do. I can't see why we shouldn't
employ him as well as another."</p>

<p>"I don't believe Gil likes the idea of any other fellow in
Lycurgus having the same name and looking like him," suggested
Bella, slyly, and with a certain touch of malice due to the fact
that her brother was always criticizing her.</p>

<p>"Oh, what rot!" Gilbert snapped irritably. "Why don't you make a
sensible remark once in a while? What do I care whether he has the
same name or not&mdash;or looks like me, either?" His expression at
the moment was particularly sour.</p>

<p>"Gilbert!" pleaded his mother, reprovingly. "How can you talk
so? And to your sister, too?"</p>

<p>"Well, I don't want to do anything in connection with this young
man if it's going to cause any hard feelings here," went on
Griffiths senior. "All I know is that his father was never very
practical and I doubt if Clyde has ever had a real chance." (His
son winced at this friendly and familiar use of his cousin's first
name.) "My only idea in bringing him on here was to give him a
start. I haven't the faintest idea whether he would make good or
not. He might and again he might not. If he didn't&mdash;" He threw
up one hand as much as to say, "If he doesn't, we will have to toss
him aside, of course."</p>

<p>"Well, I think that's very kind of you, father," observed Mrs.
Griffiths, pleasantly and diplomatically. "I hope he proves
satisfactory."</p>

<p>"And there's another thing," added Griffiths wisely and
sententiously. "I don't expect this young man, so long as he is in
my employ and just because he's a nephew of mine, to be treated
differently to any other employee in the factory. He's coming here
to work&mdash;not play. And while he is here, trying, I don't
expect any of you to pay him any social attention&mdash;not the
slightest. He's not the sort of boy anyhow, that would want to put
himself on us&mdash;at least he didn't impress me that way, and he
wouldn't be coming down here with any notion that he was to be
placed on an equal footing with any of us. That would be silly.
Later on, if he proves that he is really worth while, able to take
care of himself, knows his place and keeps it, and any of you
wanted to show him any little attention, well, then it will be time
enough to see, but not before then."</p>

<p>By then, the maid, Amanda, assistant to Mrs. Truesdale, was
taking away the dinner plates and preparing to serve the dessert.
But as Mr. Griffiths rarely ate dessert, and usually chose this
period, unless company was present, to look after certain stock and
banking matters which he kept in a small desk in the library, he
now pushed back his chair, arose, excusing himself to his family,
and walked into the library adjoining. The others remained.</p>

<p>"I would like to see what he's like, wouldn't you?" Myra asked
her mother.</p>

<p>"Yes. And I do hope he measures up to all of your father's
expectations. He will not feel right if he doesn't."</p>

<p>"I can't get this," observed Gilbert, "bringing people on now
when we can hardly take care of those we have. And besides, imagine
what the bunch around here will say if they find out that our
cousin was only a bell-hop before coming here!"</p>

<p>"Oh, well, they won't have to know that, will they?" said
Myra.</p>

<p>"Oh, won't they? Well, what's to prevent him from speaking about
it&mdash;unless we tell him not to&mdash;or some one coming along
who has seen him there." His eyes snapped viciously. "At any rate,
I hope he doesn't. It certainly wouldn't do us any good around
here."</p>

<p>And Bella added, "I hope he's not dull as Uncle Allen's two
boys. They're the most uninteresting boys I ever did see."</p>

<p>"Bella," cautioned her mother once more.</p>

<h3>Chapter 3</h3>

<p>The Clyde whom Samuel Griffiths described as having met at the
Union League Club in Chicago, was a somewhat modified version of
the one who had fled from Kansas City three years before. He was
now twenty, a little taller and more firmly but scarcely any more
robustly built, and considerably more experienced, of course. For
since leaving his home and work in Kansas City and coming in
contact with some rough usage in the world&mdash;humble tasks,
wretched rooms, no intimates to speak of, plus the compulsion to
make his own way as best he might&mdash;he had developed a kind of
self-reliance and smoothness of address such as one would scarcely
have credited him with three years before. There was about him now,
although he was not nearly so smartly dressed as when he left
Kansas City, a kind of conscious gentility of manner which pleased,
even though it did not at first arrest attention. Also, and this
was considerably different from the Clyde who had crept away from
Kansas City in a box car, he had much more of an air of caution and
reserve.</p>

<p>For ever since he had fled from Kansas City, and by one humble
device and another forced to make his way, he had been coming to
the conclusion that on himself alone depended his future. His
family, as he now definitely sensed, could do nothing for him. They
were too impractical and too poor&mdash;his mother, father, Esta,
all of them.</p>

<p>At the same time, in spite of all their difficulties, he could
not now help but feel drawn to them, his mother in particular, and
the old home life that had surrounded him as a boy&mdash;his
brother and sisters, Esta included, since she, too, as he now saw
it, had been brought no lower than he by circumstances over which
she probably had no more control. And often, his thoughts and mood
had gone back with a definite and disconcerting pang because of the
way in which he had treated his mother as well as the way in which
his career in Kansas City had been suddenly interrupted&mdash;his
loss of Hortense Briggs&mdash;a severe blow; the troubles that had
come to him since; the trouble that must have come to his mother
and Esta because of him.</p>

<p>On reaching St. Louis two days later after his flight, and after
having been most painfully bundled out into the snow a hundred
miles from Kansas City in the gray of a winter morning, and at the
same time relieved of his watch and overcoat by two brakemen who
had found him hiding in the car, he had picked up a Kansas City
paper&mdash;The Star&mdash;only to realize that his worst fear in
regard to all that had occurred had come true. For there, under a
two-column head, and with fully a column and a half of reading
matter below, was the full story of all that had happened: a little
girl, the eleven-year-old daughter of a well-to-do Kansas City
family, knocked down and almost instantly killed&mdash;she had died
an hour later; Sparser and Miss Sipe in a hospital and under arrest
at the same time, guarded by a policeman sitting in the hospital
awaiting their recovery; a splendid car very seriously damaged;
Sparser's father, in the absence of the owner of the car for whom
he worked, at once incensed and made terribly unhappy by the folly
and seeming criminality and recklessness of his son.</p>

<p>But what was worse, the unfortunate Sparser had already been
charged with larceny and homicide, and wishing, no doubt, to
minimize his own share in this grave catastrophe, had not only
revealed the names of all who were with him in the car&mdash;the
youths in particular and their hotel address&mdash;but had charged
that they along with him were equally guilty, since they had urged
him to make speed at the time and against his will&mdash;a claim
which was true enough, as Clyde knew. And Mr. Squires, on being
interviewed at the hotel, had furnished the police and the
newspapers with the names of their parents and their home
addresses.</p>

<p>This last was the sharpest blow of all. For there followed
disturbing pictures of how their respective parents or relatives
had taken it on being informed of their sins. Mrs. Ratterer, Tom's
mother, had cried and declared her boy was a good boy, and had not
meant to do any harm, she was sure. And Mrs. Hegglund&mdash;Oscar's
devoted but aged mother&mdash;had said that there was not a more
honest or generous soul and that he must have been drinking. And at
his own home&mdash;The Star had described his mother as standing,
pale, very startled and very distressed, clasping and unclasping
her hands and looking as though she were scarcely able to grasp
what was meant, unwilling to believe that her son had been one of
the party and assuring all that he would most certainly return soon
and explain all, and that there must be some mistake.</p>

<p>However, he had not returned. Nor had he heard anything more
after that. For, owing to his fear of the police, as well as of his
mother&mdash;her sorrowful, hopeless eyes, he had not written for
months, and then a letter to his mother only to say that he was
well and that she must not worry. He gave neither name nor address.
Later, after that he had wandered on, essaying one small job and
another, in St. Louis, Peoria, Chicago, Milwaukee&mdash;
dishwashing in a restaurant, soda-clerking in a small outlying
drug-store, attempting to learn to be a shoe clerk, a grocer's
clerk, and what not; and being discharged and laid off and quitting
because he did not like it. He had sent her ten dollars once&mdash;
another time five, having, as he felt, that much to spare. After
nearly a year and a half he had decided that the search must have
lessened, his own part in the crime being forgotten, possibly, or
by then not deemed sufficiently important to pursue&mdash;and when
he was once more making a moderate living as the driver of a
delivery wagon in Chicago, a job that paid him fifteen dollars a
week, he resolved that he would write his mother, because now he
could say that he had a decent place and had conducted himself
respectably for a long time, although not under his own name.</p>

<p>And so at that time, living in a hall bedroom on the West Side
of Chicago&mdash;Paulina Street&mdash;he had written his mother the
following letter:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>DEAR MOTHER:<br>
<br>
Are you still in Kansas City? I wish you would write and tell me. I
would so like to hear from you again and to write you again, too,
if you really want me to. Honestly I do, Ma. I have been so lonely
here. Only be careful and don't let any one know where I am yet. It
won't do any good and might do a lot of harm just when I am trying
so hard to get a start again. I didn't do anything wrong that time,
myself. Really I didn't, although the papers said so&mdash; just
went along. But I was afraid they would punish me for something
that I didn't do. I just couldn't come back then. I wasn't to blame
and then I was afraid of what you and father might think. But they
invited me, Ma. I didn't tell him to go any faster or to take that
car like he said. He took it himself and invited me and the others
to go along. Maybe we were all to blame for running down that
little girl, but we didn't mean to. None of us. And I have been so
terribly sorry ever since. Think of all the trouble I have caused
you! And just at the time when you most needed me. Gee! Mother, I
hope you can forgive me. Can you?<br>
<br>
I keep wondering how you are. And Esta and Julia and Frank and
Father. I wish I knew where you are and what you are doing. You
know how I feel about you, don't you, Ma? I've got a lot more sense
now, anyhow, I see things different than I used to. I want to do
something in this world. I want to be successful. I have only a
fair place now, not as good as I had in K. C., but fair, and not in
the same line. But I want something better, though I don't want to
go back in the hotel business either if I can help it. It's not so
very good for a young man like me&mdash;too high-flying, I guess.
You see I know a lot more than I did back there. They like me all
right where I am, but I got to get on in this world. Besides I am
not really making more than my expenses here now, just my room and
board and clothes but I am trying to save a little in order to get
into some line where I can work up and learn something. A person
has to have a line of some kind these days. I see that now.<br>
<br>
Won't you write me and tell me how you all are and what you are
doing? I'd like to know. Give my love to Frank and Julia and Father
and Esta, if they are all still there. I love you just the same and
I guess you care for me a little, anyhow, don't you? I won't sign
my real name, because it may be dangerous yet (I haven't been using
it since I left K. C.) But I'll give you my other one, which I'm
going to leave off pretty soon and take up my old one. Wish I could
do it now, but I'm afraid to yet. You can address me, if you will,
as<br>
<br>
HARRY TENET,<br>
<br>
General Delivery, Chicago<br>
<br>
I'll call for it in a few days. I sign this way so as not to cause
you or me any more trouble, see? But as soon as I feel more sure
that this other thing has blown over, I'll use my own name again
sure.<br>
<br>
Lovingly,<br>
YOUR SON.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He drew a line where his real name should be and underneath
wrote "you know" and mailed the letter.</p>

<p>Following that, because his mother had been anxious about him
all this time and wondering where he was, he soon received a
letter, postmarked Denver, which surprised him very much, for he
had expected to hear from her as still in Kansas City.</p>

<blockquote>DEAR SON:<br>
<br>
I was surprised and so glad to get my boy's letter and to know that
you were alive and safe. I had hoped and prayed that you would
return to the straight and narrow path&mdash;the only path that
will ever lead you to success and happiness of any kind, and that
God would let me hear from you as safe and well and working
somewhere and doing well. And now he has rewarded my prayers. I
knew he would. Blessed be His holy name.<br>
<br>
Not that I blame you altogether for all that terrible trouble you
got into and bringing so much suffering and disgrace on yourself
and us&mdash;for well I know how the devil tempts and pursues all
of us mortals and particularly just such a child as you. Oh, my
son, if you only knew how you must be on your guard to avoid these
pitfalls. And you have such a long road ahead of you. Will you be
ever watchful and try always to cling to the teachings of our
Saviour that your mother has always tried to impress upon the minds
and hearts of all you dear children? Will you stop and listen to
the voice of our Lord that is ever with us, guiding our footsteps
safely up the rocky path that leads to a heaven more beautiful than
we can ever imagine here? Promise me, my child, that you will hold
fast to all your early teachings and always bear in mind that
"right is might," and my boy, never, never, take a drink of any
kind no matter who offers it to you. There is where the devil
reigns in all his glory and is ever ready to triumph over the weak
one. Remember always what I have told you so often "Strong drink is
raging and wine is a mocker," and it is my earnest prayer that
these words will ring in your ears every time you are
tempted&mdash;for I am sure now that that was perhaps the real
cause of that terrible accident.<br>
<br>
I suffered terribly over that, Clyde, and just at the time when I
had such a dreadful ordeal to face with Esta. I almost lost her.
She had such an awful time. The poor child paid dearly for her sin.
We had to go in debt so deep and it took so long to work it
out&mdash;but finally we did and now things are not as bad as they
were, quite.<br>
<br>
As you see, we are now in Denver. We have a mission of our own here
now with housing quarters for all of us. Besides we have a few
rooms to rent which Esta, and you know she is now Mrs. Nixon, of
course, takes care of. She has a fine little boy who reminds your
father and me of you so much when you were a baby. He does little
things that are you all over again so many times that we almost
feel that you are with us again&mdash;as you were. It is
comforting, too, sometimes.<br>
<br>
Frank and Julie have grown so and are quite a help to me. Frank has
a paper route and earns a little money which helps. Esta wants to
keep them in school just as long as we can.<br>
<br>
Your father is not very well, but of course, he is getting older,
and he does the best he can.<br>
<br>
I am awful glad, Clyde, that you are trying so hard to better
yourself in every way and last night your father was saying again
that your uncle, Samuel Griffiths, of Lycurgus, is so rich and
successful and I thought that maybe if you wrote him and asked him
to give you something there so that you could learn the business,
perhaps he would. I don't see why he wouldn't. After all you are
his nephew. You know he has a great collar business there in
Lycurgus and he is very rich, so they say. Why don't you write him
and see? Somehow I feel that perhaps he would find a place for you
and then you would have something sure to work for. Let me know if
you do and what he says.<br>
<br>
I want to hear from you often, Clyde. Please write and let us know
all about you and how you are getting along. Won't you? Of course
we love you as much as ever, and will do our best always to try to
guide you right. We want you to succeed more than you know, but we
also want you to be a good boy, and live a clean, righteous life,
for, my son, what matter it if a man gaineth the whole world and
loseth his own soul?<br>
<br>
Write your mother, Clyde, and bear in mind that her love is always
with you&mdash;guiding you&mdash;pleading with you to do right in
the name of the Lord.<br>
<br>
Affectionately,<br>
<br>
MOTHER.</blockquote>

<p>And so it was that Clyde had begun to think of his uncle Samuel
and his great business long before he encountered him. He had also
experienced an enormous relief in learning that his parents were no
longer in the same financial difficulties they were when he left,
and safely housed in a hotel, or at least a lodging house, probably
connected with this new mission.</p>

<p>Then two months after he had received his mother's first letter
and while he was deciding almost every day that he must do
something, and that forthwith, he chanced one day to deliver to the
Union League Club on Jackson Boulevard a package of ties and
handkerchiefs which some visitor to Chicago had purchased at the
store, for which he worked. Upon entering, who should he come in
contact with but Ratterer in the uniform of a club employee. He was
in charge of inquiry and packages at the door. Although neither he
nor Ratterer quite grasped immediately the fact that they were
confronting one another again, after a moment Ratterer had
exclaimed: "Clyde!" And then seizing him by an arm, he added
enthusiastically and yet cautiously in a very low tone: "Well, of
all things! The devil! Whaddya know? Put 'er there. Where do you
come from anyhow?" And Clyde, equally excited, exclaimed, "Well, by
jing, if it ain't Tom. Whaddya know? You working here?"</p>

<p>Ratterer, who (like Clyde) had for the moment quite forgotten
the troublesome secret which lay between them, added: "That's
right. Surest thing you know. Been here for nearly a year, now."
Then with a sudden pull at Clyde's arm, as much as to say,
"Silence!" he drew Clyde to one side, out of the hearing of the
youth to whom he had been talking as Clyde came in, and added:
"Ssh! I'm working here under my own name, but I'd rather not let
'em know I'm from K. C., see. I'm supposed to be from
Cleveland."</p>

<p>And with that he once more pressed Clyde's arm genially and
looked him over. And Clyde, equally moved, added: "Sure. That's all
right. I'm glad you were able to connect. My name's Tenet, Harry
Tenet. Don't forget that." And both were radiantly happy because of
old times' sake.</p>

<p>But Ratterer, noticing Clyde's delivery uniform, observed:
"Driving a delivery, eh? Gee, that's funny. You driving a delivery.
Imagine. That kills me. What do you want to do that for?" Then
seeing from Clyde's expression that his reference to his present
position might not be the most pleasing thing in the world, since
Clyde at once observed: "Well, I've been up against it, sorta," he
added: "But say, I want to see you. Where are you living?" (Clyde
told him.) "That's all right. I get off here at six. Why not drop
around after you're through work. Or, I'll tell you&mdash;suppose
we meet at&mdash;well, how about Henrici's on Randolph Street? Is
that all right? At seven, say. I get off at six and I can be over
there by then if you can."</p>

<p>Clyde, who was happy to the point of ecstasy in meeting Ratterer
again, nodded a cheerful assent.</p>

<p>He boarded his wagon and continued his deliveries, yet for the
rest of the afternoon his mind was on this approaching meeting with
Ratterer. And at five-thirty he hurried to his barn and then to his
boarding house on the west side, where he donned his street
clothes, then hastened to Henrici's. He had not been standing on
the corner a minute before Ratterer appeared, very genial and
friendly and dressed, if anything, more neatly than ever.</p>

<p>"Gee, it's good to have a look at you, old socks!" he began. "Do
you know you're the only one of that bunch that I've seen since I
left K. C.? That's right. My sister wrote me after we left home
that no one seemed to know what became of either Higby or Heggie,
or you, either. They sent that fellow Sparser up for a
year&mdash;did you hear that? Tough, eh? But not so much for
killing the little girl, but for taking the car and running it
without a license and not stopping when signaled. That's what they
got him for. But say,"&mdash;he lowered his voice most
significantly at this point&mdash; "we'da got that if they'd got
us. Oh, gee, I was scared. And run?" And once more he began to
laugh, but rather hysterically at that. "What a wallop, eh? An' us
leavin' him and that girl in the car. Oh, say. Tough, what? Just
what else could a fellow do, though? No need of all of us going up,
eh? What was her name? Laura Sipe. An' you cut out before I saw
you, even. And that little Briggs girl of yours did, too. Did you
go home with her?"</p>

<p>Clyde shook his head negatively.</p>

<p>"I should say I didn't," he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Well, where did you go then?" he asked.</p>

<p>Clyde told him. And after he had set forth a full picture of his
own wayfarings, Ratterer returned with: "Gee, you didn't know that
that little Briggs girl left with a guy from out there for New York
right after that, did you? Some fellow who worked in a cigar store,
so Louise told me. She saw her afterwards just before she left with
a new fur coat and all." (Clyde winced sadly.) "Gee, but you were a
sucker to fool around with her. She didn't care for you or nobody.
But you was pretty much gone on her, I guess, eh?" And he grinned
at Clyde amusedly, and chucked him under the arm, in his old
teasing way.</p>

<p>But in regard to himself, he proceeded to unfold a tale of only
modest adventure, which was very different from the one Clyde had
narrated, a tale which had less of nerves and worry and more of a
sturdy courage and faith in his own luck and possibilities. And
finally he had "caught on" to this, because, as he phrased it, "you
can always get something in Chi."</p>

<p>And here he had been ever since&mdash;"very quiet, of course,"
but no one had ever said a word to him.</p>

<p>And forthwith, he began to explain that just at present there
wasn't anything in the Union League, but that he would talk to Mr.
Haley who was superintendent of the club&mdash;and that if Clyde
wanted to, and Mr. Haley knew of anything, he would try and find
out if there was an opening anywhere, or likely to be, and if so,
Clyde could slip into it.</p>

<p>"But can that worry stuff," he said to Clyde toward the end of
the evening. "It don't get you nothing."</p>

<p>And then only two days after this most encouraging conversation,
and while Clyde was still debating whether he would resign his job,
resume his true name and canvass the various hotels in search of
work, a note came to his room, brought by one of the bell-boys of
the Union League which read: "See Mr. Lightall at the Great
Northern before noon to-morrow. There's a vacancy over there. It
ain't the very best, but it'll get you something better later."</p>

<p>And accordingly Clyde, after telephoning his department manager
that he was ill and would not be able to work that day, made his
way to this hotel in his very best clothes. And on the strength of
what references he could give, was allowed to go to work; and much
to his relief under his own name. Also, to his gratification, his
salary was fixed at twenty dollars a month, meals included. But the
tips, as he now learned, aggregated not more than ten a week&mdash;
yet that, counting meals was far more than he was now getting as he
comforted himself; and so much easier work, even if it did take him
back into the old line, where he still feared to be seen and
arrested.</p>

<p>It was not so very long after this&mdash;not more than three
months&mdash; before a vacancy occurred in the Union League staff.
Ratterer, having some time before established himself as day
assistant to the club staff captain, and being on good terms with
him, was able to say to the latter that he knew exactly the man for
the place&mdash;Clyde Griffiths&mdash;then employed at the Great
Northern. And accordingly, Clyde was sent for, and being carefully
coached beforehand by Ratterer as to how to approach his new
superior, and what to say, he was given the place.</p>

<p>And here, very different from the Great Northern and superior
from a social and material point of view, as Clyde saw it, to even
the Green-Davidson, he was able once more to view at close range a
type of life that most affected, unfortunately, his bump of
position and distinction. For to this club from day to day came or
went such a company of seemingly mentally and socially worldly
elect as he had never seen anywhere before, the self-integrated and
self-centered from not only all of the states of his native land
but from all countries and continents. American politicians from
the north, south, east, west&mdash;the principal politicians and
bosses, or alleged statesmen of their particular
regions&mdash;surgeons, scientists, arrived physicians, generals,
literary and social figures, not only from America but from the
world over.</p>

<p>Here also, a fact which impressed and even startled his sense of
curiosity and awe, even&mdash;there was no faintest trace of that
sex element which had characterized most of the phases of life to
be seen in the Green-Davidson, and more recently the Great
Northern. In fact, in so far as he could remember, had seemed to
run through and motivate nearly, if not quite all of the phases of
life that he had thus far contacted. But here was no sex&mdash;no
trace of it. No women were admitted to this club. These various
distinguished individuals came and went, singly as a rule, and with
the noiseless vigor and reserve that characterizes the ultra
successful. They often ate alone, conferred in pairs and groups,
noiselessly&mdash;read their papers or books, or went here and
there in swiftly driven automobiles&mdash;but for the most part
seemed to be unaware of, or at least unaffected by, that element of
passion, which, to his immature mind up to this time, had seemed to
propel and disarrange so many things in those lesser worlds with
which up to now he had been identified.</p>

<p>Probably one could not attain to or retain one's place in so
remarkable a world as this unless one were indifferent to sex, a
disgraceful passion, of course. And hence in the presence or under
the eyes of such people one had to act and seem as though such
thoughts as from time to time swayed one were far from one's
mind.</p>

<p>After he had worked here a little while, under the influence of
this organization and various personalities who came here, he had
taken on a most gentlemanly and reserved air. When he was within
the precincts of the club itself, he felt himself different from
what he really was&mdash;more subdued, less romantic, more
practical, certain that if he tried now, imitated the soberer
people of the world, and those only, that some day he might
succeed, if not greatly, at least much better than he had thus far.
And who knows? What if he worked very steadily and made only the
right sort of contacts and conducted himself with the greatest care
here, one of these very remarkable men whom he saw entering or
departing from here might take a fancy to him and offer him a
connection with something important somewhere, such as he had never
had before, and that might lift him into a world such as he had
never known.</p>

<p>For to say the truth, Clyde had a soul that was not destined to
grow up. He lacked decidedly that mental clarity and inner
directing application that in so many permits them to sort out from
the facts and avenues of life the particular thing or things that
make for their direct advancement.</p>

<h3>Chapter 4</h3>

<p>However, as he now fancied, it was because he lacked an
education that he had done so poorly. Because of those various
moves from city to city in his early youth, he had never been
permitted to collect such a sum of practical training in any field
as would permit him, so he thought, to aspire to the great worlds
of which these men appeared to be a part. Yet his soul now yearned
for this. The people who lived in fine houses, who stopped at great
hotels, and had men like Mr. Squires, and the manager of the
bell-hops here, to wait on them and arrange for their comfort. And
he was still a bell-hop. And close to twenty-one. At times it made
him very sad. He wished and wished that he could get into some work
where he could rise and be somebody&mdash;not always remain a
bell-hop, as at times he feared he might.</p>

<p>About the time that he reached this conclusion in regard to
himself and was meditating on some way to improve and safeguard his
future, his uncle, Samuel Griffiths, arrived in Chicago. And having
connections here which made a card to this club an obvious
civility, he came directly to it and for several days was about the
place conferring with individuals who came to see him, or hurrying
to and fro to meet people and visit concerns whom he deemed it
important to see.</p>

<p>And it was not an hour after he arrived before Ratterer, who had
charge of the pegboard at the door by day and who had but a moment
before finished posting the name of this uncle on the board,
signaled to Clyde, who came over.</p>

<p>"Didn't you say you had an uncle or something by the name of
Griffiths in the collar business somewhere in New York State?"</p>

<p>"Sure," replied Clyde. "Samuel Griffiths. He has a big collar
factory in Lycurgus. That's his ad you see in all the papers and
that's his fire sign over there on Michigan Avenue."</p>

<p>"Would you know him if you saw him?"</p>

<p>"No," replied Clyde. "I never saw him in all my life."</p>

<p>"I'll bet anything it's the same fellow," commented Ratterer,
consulting a small registry slip that had been handed him. "Looka
here&mdash;Samuel Griffiths, Lycurgus, N. Y. That's probably the
same guy, eh?"</p>

<p>"Surest thing you know," added Clyde, very much interested and
even excited, for this was the identical uncle about whom he had
been thinking so long.</p>

<p>"He just went through here a few minutes ago," went on Ratterer.
"Devoy took his bags up to K. Swell-looking man, too. You better
keep your eye open and take a look at him when he comes down again.
Maybe it's your uncle. He's only medium tall and kinda thin. Wears
a small gray mustache and a pearl gray hat. Good-lookin'. I'll
point him out to you. If it is your uncle you better shine up to
him. Maybe he'll do somepin' for you&mdash;give you a collar or
two," he added, laughing.</p>

<p>Clyde laughed too as though he very much appreciated this joke,
although in reality he was flustered. His uncle Samuel! And in this
club! Well, then this was his opportunity to introduce himself to
his uncle. He had intended writing him before ever he secured this
place, but now he was here in this club and might speak to him if
he chose.</p>

<p>But hold! What would his uncle think of him, supposing he chose
to introduce himself? For he was a bell-boy again and acting in
that capacity in this club. What, for instance, might be his
uncle's attitude toward boys who worked as bell-boys, particularly
at his&mdash; Clyde's&mdash;years. For he was over twenty now, and
getting to be pretty old for a bell-boy, that is, if one ever
intended to be anything else. A man of his wealth and high position
might look on bell-hopping as menial, particularly bell-boys who
chanced to be related to him. He might not wish to have anything to
do with him&mdash; might not even wish him to address him in any
way. It was in this state that he remained for fully twenty-four
hours after he knew that his uncle had arrived at this club.</p>

<p>The following afternoon, however, after he had seen him at least
half a dozen times and had been able to formulate the most
agreeable impressions of him, since his uncle appeared to be so
very quick, alert, incisive&mdash;so very different from his father
in every way, and so rich and respected by every one here&mdash;he
began to wonder, to fear even at times, whether he was going to let
this remarkable opportunity slip. For after all, his uncle did not
look to him to be at all unkindly&mdash;quite the
reverse&mdash;very pleasant. And when, at the suggestion of
Ratterer, he had gone to his uncle's room to secure a letter which
was to be sent by special messenger, his uncle had scarcely looked
at him, but instead had handed him the letter and half a dollar.
"See that a boy takes that right away and keep the money for
yourself," he had remarked.</p>

<p>Clyde's excitement was so great at the moment that he wondered
that his uncle did not guess that he was his nephew. But plainly he
did not. And he went away a little crest-fallen.</p>

<p>Later some half dozen letters for his uncle having been put in
the key-box, Ratterer called Clyde's attention to them. "If you
want to run in on him again, here's your chance. Take those up to
him. He's in his room, I think." And Clyde, after some hesitation,
had finally taken the letters and gone to his uncle's suite once
more.</p>

<p>His uncle was writing at the time and merely called: "Come!"
Then Clyde, entering and smiling rather enigmatically, observed:
"Here's some mail for you, Mr. Griffiths."</p>

<p>"Thank you very much, my son," replied his uncle and proceeded
to finger his vest pocket for change, but Clyde, seizing this
opportunity, exclaimed: "Oh, no, I don't want anything for that."
And then before his uncle could say anything more, although he
proceeded to hold out some silver to him, he added: "I believe I'm
related to you, Mr. Griffiths. You're Mr. Samuel Griffiths of the
Griffiths Collar Company of Lycurgus, aren't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I have a little something to do with it, I believe. Who
are you?" returned his uncle, looking at him sharply.</p>

<p>"My name's Clyde Griffiths. My father, Asa Griffiths, is your
brother, I believe."</p>

<p>At the mention of this particular brother, who, to the knowledge
of all the members of this family, was distinctly not a success
materially, the face of Samuel Griffiths clouded the least trifle.
For the mention of Asa brought rather unpleasingly before him the
stocky and decidedly not well-groomed figure of his younger
brother, whom he had not seen in so many years. His most recent
distinct picture of him was as a young man of about Clyde's age
about his father's house near Bertwick, Vermont. But how different!
Clyde's father was then short, fat and poorly knit mentally as well
as physically&mdash;oleaginous and a bit mushy, as it were. His
chin was not firm, his eyes a pale watery blue, and his hair
frizzled. Whereas this son of his was neat, alert, good-looking and
seemingly well-mannered and intelligent, as most bell-hops were
inclined to be as he noted. And he liked him.</p>

<p>However, Samuel Griffiths, who along with his elder brother
Allen had inherited the bulk of his father's moderate property, and
this because of Joseph Griffiths' prejudice against his youngest
son, had always felt that perhaps an injustice had been done Asa.
For Asa, not having proved very practical or intelligent, his
father had first attempted to drive and then later ignore him, and
finally had turned him out at about Clyde's age, and had afterward
left the bulk of his property, some thirty thousand dollars, to
these two elder brothers, share and share alike&mdash;willing Asa
but a petty thousand.</p>

<p>It was this thought in connection with this younger brother that
now caused him to stare at Clyde rather curiously. For Clyde, as he
could see, was in no way like the younger brother who had been
harried from his father's home so many years before. Rather he was
more like his own son, Gilbert, whom, as he now saw he resembled.
Also in spite of all of Clyde's fears he was obviously impressed by
the fact that he should have any kind of place in this interesting
club. For to Samuel Griffiths, who was more than less confined to
the limited activities and environment of Lycurgus, the character
and standing of this particular club was to be respected. And those
young men who served the guests of such an institution as this,
were, in the main, possessed of efficient and unobtrusive manners.
Therefore to see Clyde standing before him in his neat gray and
black uniform and with the air of one whose social manners at least
were excellent, caused him to think favorably of him.</p>

<p>"You don't tell me!" he exclaimed interestedly. "So you're Asa's
son. I do declare! Well, now, this is a surprise. You see I haven't
seen or heard from your father in at least&mdash;well, say,
twenty-five or six years, anyhow. The last time I did hear from him
he was living in Grand Rapids, Michigan, I think, or here. He isn't
here now, I presume."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, sir," replied Clyde, who was glad to be able to say
this. "The family live in Denver. I'm here all alone."</p>

<p>"Your father and mother are living, I presume."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. They're both alive."</p>

<p>"Still connected with religious work, is he&mdash;your
father?"</p>

<p>"Well, yes, sir," answered Clyde, a little dubiously, for he was
still convinced that the form of religious work his father essayed
was of all forms the poorest and most inconsequential socially.
"Only the church he has now," he went on, "has a lodging house
connected with it. About forty rooms, I believe. He and my mother
run that and the mission too."</p>

<p>"Oh, I see."</p>

<p>He was so anxious to make a better impression on his uncle than
the situation seemed to warrant that he was quite willing to
exaggerate a little.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm glad they're doing so well," continued Samuel
Griffiths, rather impressed with the trim and vigorous appearance
of Clyde. "You like this kind of work, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Well, not exactly. No, Mr. Griffiths, I don't," replied Clyde
quickly, alive at once to the possibilities of this query. "It pays
well enough. But I don't like the way you have to make the money
you get here. It isn't my idea of a salary at all. But I got in
this because I didn't have a chance to study any particular work or
get in with some company where there was a real chance to work up
and make something of myself. My mother wanted me to write you once
and ask whether there was any chance in your company for me to
begin and work up, but I was afraid maybe that you might not like
that exactly, and so I never did."</p>

<p>He paused, smiling, and yet with an inquiring look in his
eye.</p>

<p>His uncle looked solemnly at him for a moment, pleased by his
looks and his general manner of approach in this instance, and then
replied: "Well, that is very interesting. You should have written,
if you wanted to&mdash;" Then, as was his custom in all matters, he
cautiously paused. Clyde noted that he was hesitating to encourage
him.</p>

<p>"I don't suppose there is anything in your company that you
would let me do?" he ventured boldly, after a moment.</p>

<p>Samuel Griffiths merely stared at him thoughtfully. He liked and
he did not like this direct request. However, Clyde appeared at
least a very adaptable person for the purpose. He seemed bright and
ambitious&mdash;so much like his own son, and he might readily fit
into some department as head or assistant under his son, once he
had acquired a knowledge of the various manufacturing processes. At
any rate he might let him try it. There could be no real harm in
that. Besides, there was his younger brother, to whom, perhaps,
both he and his older brother Allen owed some form of obligation,
if not exactly restitution.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, after a moment, "that is something I would have
to think over a little. I wouldn't be able to say, offhand, whether
there is or not. We wouldn't be able to pay you as much as you make
here to begin with," he warned.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's all right," exclaimed Clyde, who was far more
fascinated by the thought of connecting himself with his uncle than
anything else. "I wouldn't expect very much until I was able to
earn it, of course."</p>

<p>"Besides, it might be that you would find that you didn't like
the collar business once you got into it, or we might find we
didn't like you. Not every one is suited to it by a long way."</p>

<p>"Well, all you'd have to do then would be to discharge me,"
assured Clyde. "I've always thought I would be, though, ever since
I heard of you and your big company."</p>

<p>This last remark pleased Samuel Griffiths. Plainly he and his
achievements had stood in the nature of an ideal to this youth.</p>

<p>"Very well," he said. "I won't be able to give any more time to
this now. But I'll be here for a day or two more, anyhow, and I'll
think it over. It may be that I will be able to do something for
you. I can't say now." And he turned quite abruptly to his
letters.</p>

<p>And Clyde, feeling that he had made as good an impression as
could be expected under the circumstances and that something might
come of it, thanked him profusely and beat a hasty retreat.</p>

<p>The next day, having thought it over and deciding that Clyde,
because of his briskness and intelligence, was likely to prove as
useful as another, Samuel Griffiths, after due deliberation as to
the situation at home, informed Clyde that in case any small
opening in the home factory occurred he would be glad to notify
him. But he would not even go so far as to guarantee him that an
opening would immediately be forthcoming. He must wait.</p>

<p>Accordingly Clyde was left to speculate as to how soon, if ever,
a place in his uncle's factory would be made for him.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile Samuel Griffiths had returned to Lycurgus. And
after a later conference with his son, he decided that Clyde might
be inducted into the very bottom of the business at least&mdash;the
basement of the Griffiths plant, where the shrinking of all fabrics
used in connection with the manufacture of collars was brought
about, and where beginners in this industry who really desired to
acquire the technique of it were placed, for it was his idea that
Clyde by degrees was to be taught the business from top to bottom.
And since he must support himself in some form not absolutely
incompatible with the standing of the Griffiths family here in
Lycurgus, it was decided to pay him the munificent sum of fifteen
dollars to begin.</p>

<p>For while Samuel Griffiths, as well as his son Gilbert, realized
that this was small pay (not for an ordinary apprentice but for
Clyde, since he was a relative) yet so inclined were both toward
the practical rather than the charitable in connection with all
those who worked for them, that the nearer the beginner in this
factory was to the clear mark of necessity and compulsion, the
better. Neither could tolerate the socialistic theory relative to
capitalistic exploitation. As both saw it, there had to be higher
and higher social orders to which the lower social classes could
aspire. One had to have castes. One was foolishly interfering with
and disrupting necessary and unavoidable social standards when one
tried to unduly favor any one&mdash;even a relative. It was
necessary when dealing with the classes and intelligences below
one, commercially or financially, to handle them according to the
standards to which they were accustomed. And the best of these
standards were those which held these lower individuals to a clear
realization of how difficult it was to come by money&mdash;to an
understanding of how very necessary it was for all who were engaged
in what both considered the only really important constructive work
of the world&mdash;that of material manufacture&mdash;to understand
how very essential it was to be drilled, and that sharply and
systematically, in all the details and processes which comprise
that constructive work. And so to become inured to a narrow and
abstemious life in so doing. It was good for their characters. It
informed and strengthened the minds and spirits of those who were
destined to rise. And those who were not should be kept right where
they were.</p>

<p>Accordingly, about a week after that, the nature of Clyde's work
having been finally decided upon, a letter was dispatched to him to
Chicago by Samuel Griffiths himself in which he set forth that if
he chose he might present himself any time now within the next few
weeks. But he must give due notice in writing of at least ten days
in advance of his appearance in order that he might be properly
arranged for. And upon his arrival he was to seek out Mr. Gilbert
Griffiths at the office of the mill, who would look after him.</p>

<p>And upon receipt of this Clyde was very much thrilled and at
once wrote to his mother that he had actually secured a place with
his uncle and was going to Lycurgus. Also that he was going to try
to achieve a real success now. Whereupon she wrote him a long
letter, urging him to be, oh, so careful of his conduct and
associates. Bad companionship was at the root of nearly all of the
errors and failures that befell an ambitious youth such as he. If
he would only avoid evil-minded or foolish and headstrong boys and
girls, all would be well. It was so easy for a young man of his
looks and character to be led astray by an evil woman. He had seen
what had befallen him in Kansas City. But now he was still young
and he was going to work for a man who was very rich and who could
do so much for him, if he would. And he was to write her frequently
as to the outcome of his efforts here.</p>

<p>And so, after having notified his uncle as he had requested,
Clyde finally took his departure for Lycurgus. But on his arrival
there, since his original notification from his uncle had called
for no special hour at which to call at the factory, he did not go
at once, but instead sought out the important hotel of Lycurgus,
the Lycurgus House.</p>

<p>Then finding himself with ample time on his hands, and very
curious about the character of this city in which he was to work,
and his uncle's position in it, he set forth to look it over, his
thought being that once he reported and began work he might not
soon have the time again. He now ambled out into Central Avenue,
the very heart of Lycurgus, which in this section was crossed by
several business streets, which together with Central Avenue for a
few blocks on either side, appeared to constitute the business
center&mdash; all there was to the life and gayety of Lycurgus.</p>

<h3>Chapter 5</h3>

<p>But once in this and walking about, how different it all seemed
to the world to which so recently he had been accustomed. For here,
as he had thus far seen, all was on a so much smaller scale. The
depot, from which only a half hour before he had stepped down, was
so small and dull, untroubled, as he could plainly see, by much
traffic. And the factory section which lay opposite the small
city&mdash;across the Mohawk&mdash;was little more than a red and
gray assemblage of buildings with here and there a smokestack
projecting upward, and connected with the city by two
bridges&mdash;a half dozen blocks apart&mdash;one of them directly
at this depot, a wide traffic bridge across which traveled a
car-line following the curves of Central Avenue, dotted here and
there with stores and small homes.</p>

<p>But Central Avenue was quite alive with traffic, pedestrians and
automobiles. Opposite diagonally from the hotel, which contained a
series of wide plate-glass windows, behind which were many chairs
interspersed with palms and pillars, was the dry-goods emporium of
Stark and Company, a considerable affair, four stories in height,
and of white brick, and at least a hundred feet long, the various
windows of which seemed bright and interesting, crowded with as
smart models as might be seen anywhere. Also there were other large
concerns, a second hotel, various automobile showrooms, a moving
picture theater.</p>

<p>He found himself ambling on and on until suddenly he was out of
the business district again and in touch with a wide and
tree-shaded thoroughfare of residences, the houses of which, each
and every one, appeared to possess more room space, lawn space,
general ease and repose and dignity even than any with which he had
ever been in contact. In short, as he sensed it from this brief
inspection of its very central portion, it seemed a very
exceptional, if small city street&mdash;rich, luxurious even. So
many imposing wrought-iron fences, flower-bordered walks, grouped
trees and bushes, expensive and handsome automobiles either beneath
porte-cocheres within or speeding along the broad thoroughfare
without. And in some neighboring shops&mdash;those nearest Central
Avenue and the business heart where this wide and handsome
thoroughfare began, were to be seen such expensive-looking and
apparently smart displays of the things that might well interest
people of means and comfort&mdash; motors, jewels, lingerie,
leather goods and furniture.</p>

<p>But where now did his uncle and his family live? In which house?
What street? Was it larger and finer than any of these he had seen
in this street?</p>

<p>He must return at once, he decided, and report to his uncle. He
must look up the factory address, probably in that region beyond
the river, and go over there and see him. What would he say, how
act, what would his uncle set him to doing? What would his cousin
Gilbert be like? What would he be likely to think of him? In his
last letter his uncle had mentioned his son Gilbert. He retraced
his steps along Central Avenue to the depot and found himself
quickly before the walls of the very large concern he was seeking.
It was of red brick, six stories high&mdash;almost a thousand feet
long. It was nearly all windows&mdash;at least that portion which
had been most recently added and which was devoted to collars. An
older section, as Clyde later learned, was connected with the newer
building by various bridges. And the south walls of both these two
structures, being built at the water's edge, paralleled the Mohawk.
There were also, as he now found, various entrances along River
Street, a hundred feet or more apart&mdash;and each one, guarded by
an employee in uniform&mdash;entrances numbered one, two and
three&mdash;which were labeled "for employees only"&mdash;an
entrance numbered four which read "office"&mdash;and entrances five
and six appeared to be devoted to freight receipts and
shipments.</p>

<p>Clyde made his way to the office portion and finding no one to
hinder him, passed through two sets of swinging doors and found
himself in the presence of a telephone girl seated at a telephone
desk behind a railing, in which was set a small gate&mdash;the only
entrance to the main office apparently. And this she guarded. She
was short, fat, thirty-five and unattractive.</p>

<p>"Well?" she called as Clyde appeared.</p>

<p>"I want to see Mr. Gilbert Griffiths," Clyde began a little
nervously.</p>

<p>"What about?"</p>

<p>"Well, you see, I'm his cousin. Clyde Griffiths is my name. I
have a letter here from my uncle, Mr. Samuel Griffiths. He'll see
me, I think."</p>

<p>As he laid the letter before her, he noticed that her quite
severe and decidedly indifferent expression changed and became not
so much friendly as awed. For obviously she was very much impressed
not only by the information but his looks, and began to examine him
slyly and curiously.</p>

<p>"I'll see if he's in," she replied much more civilly, and
plugging at the same time a switch which led to Mr. Gilbert
Griffiths' private office. Word coming back to her apparently that
Mr. Gilbert Griffiths was busy at the moment and could not be
disturbed, she called back: "It's Mr. Gilbert's cousin, Mr. Clyde
Griffiths. He has a letter from Mr. Samuel Griffiths." Then she
said to Clyde: "Won't you sit down? I'm sure Mr. Gilbert Griffiths
will see you in a moment. He's busy just now."</p>

<p>And Clyde, noting the unusual deference paid him&mdash;a form of
deference that never in his life before had been offered
him&mdash;was strangely moved by it. To think that he should be a
full cousin to this wealthy and influential family! This enormous
factory! So long and wide and high&mdash;as he had seen&mdash;six
stories. And walking along the opposite side of the river just now,
he had seen through several open windows whole rooms full of girls
and women hard at work. And he had been thrilled in spite of
himself. For somehow the high red walls of the building suggested
energy and very material success, a type of success that was almost
without flaw, as he saw it.</p>

<p>He looked at the gray plaster walls of this outer waiting
chamber&mdash; at some lettering on the inner door which read: "The
Griffiths Collar &amp; Shirt Company, Inc. Samuel Griffiths, Pres.
Gilbert Griffiths, Sec'y."&mdash;and wondered what it was all like
inside&mdash;what Gilbert Griffiths would be like&mdash;cold or
genial, friendly or unfriendly.</p>

<p>And then, as he sat there meditating, the woman suddenly turned
to him and observed: "You can go in now. Mr. Gilbert Griffiths'
office is at the extreme rear of this floor, over toward the river.
Any one of the clerks inside will show you."</p>

<p>She half rose as if to open the door for him, but Clyde, sensing
the intent, brushed by her. "That's all right. Thanks," he said
most warmly, and opening the glass-plated door he gazed upon a room
housing many over a hundred employees&mdash;chiefly young men and
young women. And all were apparently intent on their duties before
them. Most of them had green shades over their eyes. Quite all of
them had on short alpaca office coats or sleeve protectors over
their shirt sleeves. Nearly all of the young women wore clean and
attractive gingham dresses or office slips. And all about this
central space, which was partitionless and supported by round white
columns, were offices labeled with the names of the various minor
officials and executives of the company&mdash;Mr. Smillie, Mr.
Latch, Mr. Gotboy, Mr. Burkey.</p>

<p>Since the telephone girl had said that Mr. Gilbert Griffiths was
at the extreme rear, Clyde, without much hesitation, made his way
along the railed-off aisle to that quarter, where upon a half-open
door he read: "Mr. Gilbert Griffiths, Sec'y." He paused, uncertain
whether to walk in or not, and then proceeded to tap. At once a
sharp, penetrating voice called: "Come," and he entered and faced a
youth who looked, if anything, smaller and a little older and
certainly much colder and shrewder than himself&mdash;such a youth,
in short, as Clyde would have liked to imagine himself to be&mdash;
trained in an executive sense, apparently authoritative and
efficient. He was dressed, as Clyde noted at once, in a bright gray
suit of a very pronounced pattern, for it was once more approaching
spring. His hair, of a lighter shade than Clyde's, was brushed and
glazed most smoothly back from his temples and forehead, and his
eyes, which Clyde, from the moment he had opened the door had felt
drilling him, were of a clear, liquid, grayish-green blue. He had
on a pair of large horn-rimmed glasses which he wore at his desk
only, and the eyes that peered through them went over Clyde swiftly
and notatively, from his shoes to the round brown felt hat which he
carried in his hand.</p>

<p>"You're my cousin, I believe," he commented, rather icily, as
Clyde came forward and stopped&mdash;a thin and certainly not very
favorable smile playing about his lips.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am," replied Clyde, reduced and confused by this calm
and rather freezing reception. On the instant, as he now saw, he
could not possibly have the same regard and esteem for this cousin,
as he could and did have for his uncle, whose very great ability
had erected this important industry. Rather, deep down in himself
he felt that this young man, an heir and nothing more to this great
industry, was taking to himself airs and superiorities which, but
for his father's skill before him, would not have been
possible.</p>

<p>At the same time so groundless and insignificant were his claims
to any consideration here, and so grateful was he for anything that
might be done for him, that he felt heavily obligated already and
tried to smile his best and most ingratiating smile. Yet Gilbert
Griffiths at once appeared to take this as a bit of presumption
which ought not to be tolerated in a mere cousin, and particularly
one who was seeking a favor of him and his father.</p>

<p>However, since his father had troubled to interest himself in
him and had given him no alternative, he continued his wry smile
and mental examination, the while he said: "We thought you would be
showing up to-day or to-morrow. Did you have a pleasant trip?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, very," replied Clyde, a little confused by this
inquiry.</p>

<p>"So you think you'd like to learn something about the
manufacture of collars, do you?" Tone and manner were infiltrated
by the utmost condescension.</p>

<p>"I would certainly like to learn something that would give me a
chance to work up, have some future in it," replied Clyde, genially
and with a desire to placate his young cousin as much as
possible.</p>

<p>"Well, my father was telling me of his talk with you in Chicago.
From what he told me I gather that you haven't had much practical
experience of any kind. You don't know how to keep books, do
you?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't," replied Clyde a little regretfully.</p>

<p>"And you're not a stenographer or anything like that?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, I'm not."</p>

<p>Most sharply, as Clyde said this, he felt that he was dreadfully
lacking in every training. And now Gilbert Griffiths looked at him
as though he were rather a hopeless proposition indeed from the
viewpoint of this concern.</p>

<p>"Well, the best thing to do with you, I think," he went on, as
though before this his father had not indicated to him exactly what
was to be done in this case, "is to start you in the shrinking
room. That's where the manufacturing end of this business begins,
and you might as well be learning that from the ground up.
Afterwards, when we see how you do down there, we can tell a little
better what to do with you. If you had any office training it might
be possible to use you up here." (Clyde's face fell at this and
Gilbert noticed it. It pleased him.) "But it's just as well to
learn the practical side of the business, whatever you do," he
added rather coldly, not that he desired to comfort Clyde any but
merely to be saying it as a fact. And seeing that Clyde said
nothing, he continued: "The best thing, I presume, before you try
to do anything around here is for you to get settled somewhere. You
haven't taken a room anywhere yet, have you?"</p>

<p>"No, I just came in on the noon train," replied Clyde. "I was a
little dirty and so I just went up to the hotel to brush up a
little. I thought I'd look for a place afterwards."</p>

<p>"Well, that's right. Only don't look for any place. I'll have
our superintendent see that you're directed to a good boarding
house. He knows more about the town than you do." His thought here
was that after all Clyde was a full cousin and that it wouldn't do
to have him live just anywhere. At the same time, he was greatly
concerned lest Clyde get the notion that the family was very much
concerned as to where he did live, which most certainly it was
<i>not</i>, as he saw it. His final feeling was that he could
easily place and control Clyde in such a way as to make him not
very important to any one in any way&mdash;his father, the family,
all the people who worked here.</p>

<p>He reached for a button on his desk and pressed it. A trim girl,
very severe and reserved in a green gingham dress, appeared.</p>

<p>"Ask Mr. Whiggam to come here."</p>

<p>She disappeared and presently there entered a medium-sized and
nervous, yet moderately stout, man who looked as though he were
under a great strain. He was about forty years of
age&mdash;repressed and noncommittal&mdash;and looked curiously and
suspiciously about as though wondering what new trouble impended.
His head, as Clyde at once noticed, appeared chronically to incline
forward, while at the same time he lifted his eyes as though
actually he would prefer not to look up.</p>

<p>"Whiggam," began young Griffiths authoritatively, "this is Clyde
Griffiths, a cousin of ours. You remember I spoke to you about
him."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, he's to be put in the shrinking department for the
present. You can show him what he's to do. Afterwards you had
better have Mrs. Braley show him where he can get a room." (All
this had been talked over and fixed upon the week before by Gilbert
and Whiggam, but now he gave it the ring of an original
suggestion.) "And you'd better give his name in to the timekeeper
as beginning to-morrow morning, see?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," bowed Whiggam deferentially. "Is that all?"</p>

<p>"Yes, that's all," concluded Gilbert smartly. "You go with
Whiggam, Mr. Griffiths. He'll tell you what to do."</p>

<p>Whiggam turned. "If you'll just come with me, Mr. Griffiths," he
observed deferentially, as Clyde could see&mdash;and that for all
of his cousin's apparently condescending attitude&mdash;and marched
out with Clyde at his heels. And young Gilbert as briskly turned to
his own desk, but at the same time shaking his head. His feeling at
the moment was that mentally Clyde was not above a good bell-boy in
a city hotel probably. Else why should he come on here in this way.
"I wonder what he thinks he's going to do here," he continued to
think, "where he thinks he's going to get?"</p>

<p>And Clyde, as he followed Mr. Whiggam, was thinking what a
wonderful place Mr. Gilbert Griffiths enjoyed. No doubt he came and
went as he chose&mdash;arrived at the office late, departed early,
and somewhere in this very interesting city dwelt with his parents
and sisters in a very fine house&mdash;of course. And yet here he
was&mdash; Gilbert's own cousin, and the nephew of his wealthy
uncle, being escorted to work in a very minor department of this
great concern.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, once they were out of the sight and hearing of Mr.
Gilbert Griffiths, he was somewhat diverted from this mood by the
sights and sounds of the great manufactory itself. For here on this
very same floor, but beyond the immense office room through which
he had passed, was another much larger room filled with rows of
bins, facing aisles not more than five feet wide, and containing,
as Clyde could see, enormous quantities of collars boxed in small
paper boxes, according to sizes. These bins were either being
refilled by stock boys who brought more boxed collars from the
boxing room in large wooden trucks, or were being as rapidly
emptied by order clerks who, trundling small box trucks in front of
them, were filling orders from duplicate check lists which they
carried in their hands.</p>

<p>"Never worked in a collar factory before, Mr. Griffiths, I
presume?" commented Mr. Whiggam with somewhat more spirit, once he
was out of the presence of Gilbert Griffiths. Clyde noticed at once
the Mr. Griffiths.</p>

<p>"Oh, no," he replied quickly. "I never worked at anything like
this before."</p>

<p>"Expect to learn all about the manufacturing end of the game in
the course of time, though, I suppose." He was walking briskly
along one of the long aisles as he spoke, but Clyde noticed that he
shot sly glances in every direction.</p>

<p>"I'd like to," he answered.</p>

<p>"Well, there's a little more to it than some people think,
although you often hear there isn't very much to learn." He opened
another door, crossed a gloomy hall and entered still another room
which, filled with bins as was the other, was piled high in every
bin with bolts of white cloth.</p>

<p>"You might as well know a little about this as long as you re
going to begin in the shrinking room. This is the stuff from which
the collars are cut, the collars and the lining. They are called
webs. Each of these bolts is a web. We take these down in the
basement and shrink them because they can't be used this way. If
they are, the collars would shrink after they were cut. But you'll
see. We tub them and then dry them afterwards."</p>

<p>He marched solemnly on and Clyde sensed once more that this man
was not looking upon him as an ordinary employee by any means. His
<i>Mr.</i> Griffiths, his supposition to the effect that Clyde was
to learn all about the manufacturing end of the business, as well
as his condescension in explaining about these webs of cloth, had
already convinced Clyde that he was looked upon as one to whom some
slight homage at least must be paid.</p>

<p>He followed Mr. Whiggam, curious as to the significance of this,
and soon found himself in an enormous basement which had been
reached by descending a flight of steps at the end of a third hall.
Here, by the help of four long rows of incandescent lamps, he
discerned row after row of porcelain tubs or troughs, lengthwise of
the room, and end to end, which reached from one exterior wall to
the other. And in these, under steaming hot water apparently, were
any quantity of those same webs he had just seen upstairs, soaking.
And near-by, north and south of these tubs, and paralleling them
for the length of this room, all of a hundred and fifty feet in
length, were enormous drying racks or moving skeleton platforms,
boxed, top and bottom and sides, with hot steam pipes, between
which on rolls, but festooned in such a fashion as to take
advantage of these pipes, above, below and on either side, were
more of these webs, but unwound and wet and draped as described,
yet moving along slowly on these rolls from the east end of the
room to the west. This movement, as Clyde could see, was
accompanied by an enormous rattle and clatter of ratchet arms which
automatically shook and moved these lengths of cloth forward from
east to west. And as they moved they dried, and were then
automatically re-wound at the west end of these racks into bolt
form once more upon a wooden spool and then lifted off by a youth
whose duty it was to "take" from these moving platforms. One youth,
as Clyde saw, "took" from two of these tracks at the west end,
while at the east end another youth of about his own years "fed."
That is, he took bolts of this now partially shrunk yet still wet
cloth and attaching one end of it to some moving hooks, saw that it
slowly and properly unwound and fed itself over the drying racks
for the entire length of these tracks. As fast as it had gone the
way of all webs, another was attached.</p>

<p>Between each two rows of tubs in the center of the room were
enormous whirling separators or dryers, into which these webs of
cloth, as they came from the tubs in which they had been shrinking
for twenty-four hours, were piled and as much water as possible
centrifugally extracted before they were spread out on the drying
racks.</p>

<p>Primarily little more than this mere physical aspect of the room
was grasped by Clyde&mdash;its noise, its heat, its steam, the
energy with which a dozen men and boys were busying themselves with
various processes. They were, without exception, clothed only in
armless undershirts, a pair of old trousers belted in at the waist,
and with canvas-topped and rubber-soled sneakers on their bare
feet. The water and the general dampness and the heat of the room
seemed obviously to necessitate some such dressing as this.</p>

<p>"This is the shrinking room," observed Mr. Whiggam, as they
entered. "It isn't as nice as some of the others, but it's where
the manufacturing process begins. Kemerer!" he called.</p>

<p>A short, stocky, full-chested man, with a pate, full face and
white, strong-looking arms, dressed in a pair of dirty and wrinkled
trousers and an armless flannel shirt, now appeared. Like Whiggam
in the presence of Gilbert, he appeared to be very much overawed in
the presence of Whiggam.</p>

<p>"This is Clyde Griffiths, the cousin of Gilbert Griffiths. I
spoke to you about him last week, you remember?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"He's to begin down here. He'll show up in the morning."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Better put his name down on your check list. He'll begin at the
usual hour."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>Mr. Whiggam, as Clyde noticed, held his head higher and spoke
more directly and authoritatively than at any time so far. He
seemed to be master, not underling, now.</p>

<p>"Seven-thirty is the time every one goes to work here in the
morning," went on Mr. Whiggam to Clyde informatively, "but they all
ring in a little earlier&mdash;about seven-twenty or so, so as to
have time to change their clothes and get to the machines.</p>

<p>"Now, if you want to," he added, "Mr. Kemerer can show you what
you'll have to do to-morrow before you leave today. It might save a
little time. Or, you can leave it until then if you want to. It
don't make any difference to me. Only, if you'll come back to the
telephone girl at the main entrance about five-thirty I'll have
Mrs. Braley there for you. She's to show you about your room, I
believe. I won't be there myself, but you just ask the telephone
girl for her. She'll know." He turned and added, "Well, I'll leave
you now."</p>

<p>He lowered his head and started to go away just as Clyde began.
"Well, I'm very much obliged to you, Mr. Whiggam." Instead of
answering, he waved one fishy hand slightly upward and was
gone&mdash; down between the tubs toward the west door. And at once
Mr. Kemerer&mdash;still nervous and overawed
apparently&mdash;began.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's all right about what you have to do, Mr. Griffiths.
I'll just let you bring down webs on the floor above to begin with
to-morrow. But if you've got any old clothes, you'd better put 'em
on. A suit like that wouldn't last long here." He eyed Clyde's very
neat, if inexpensive suit, in an odd way. His manner quite like
that of Mr. Whiggam before him, was a mixture of uncertainty and a
very small authority here in Clyde's case&mdash;of extreme respect
and yet some private doubt, which only time might resolve.
Obviously it was no small thing to be a Griffiths here, even if one
were a cousin and possibly not as welcome to one's powerful
relatives as one might be.</p>

<p>At first sight, and considering what his general dreams in
connection with this industry were, Clyde was inclined to rebel.
For the type of youth and man he saw here were in his estimation
and at first glance rather below the type of individuals he hoped
to find here&mdash;individuals neither so intelligent nor alert as
those employed by the Union League and the Green-Davidson by a long
distance. And still worse he felt them to be much more subdued and
sly and ignorant&mdash;mere clocks, really. And their eyes, as he
entered with Mr. Whiggam, while they pretended not to be looking,
were very well aware, as Clyde could feel, of all that was going
on. Indeed, he and Mr. Whiggam were the center of all their secret
looks. At the same time, their spare and practical manner of
dressing struck dead at one blow any thought of refinement in
connection with the work in here. How unfortunate that his lack of
training would not permit his being put to office work or something
like that upstairs.</p>

<p>He walked with Mr. Kemerer, who troubled to say that these were
the tubs in which the webs were shrunk over night&mdash;these the
centrifugal dryers&mdash;these the rack dryers. Then he was told
that he could go. And by then it was only three o'clock.</p>

<p>He made his way out of the nearest door and once outside he
congratulated himself on being connected with this great company,
while at the same time wondering whether he was going to prove
satisfactory to Mr. Kemerer and Mr. Whiggam. Supposing he didn't.
Or supposing he couldn't stand all this? It was pretty rough. Well,
if worst came to worst, as he now thought, he could go back to
Chicago, or on to New York, maybe, and get work.</p>

<p>But why hadn't Samuel Griffiths had the graciousness to receive
and welcome him? Why had that young Gilbert Griffiths smiled so
cynically? And what sort of a woman was this Mrs. Braley? Had he
done wisely to come on here? Would this family do anything for him
now that he was here?</p>

<p>It was thus that, strolling west along River Street on which
were a number of other kinds of factories, and then north through a
few other streets that held more factories&mdash;tinware, wickwire,
a big vacuum carpet cleaning plant, a rug manufacturing company,
and the like&mdash;that he came finally upon a miserable slum, the
like of which, small as it was, he had not seen outside of Chicago
or Kansas City. He was so irritated and depressed by the poverty
and social angularity and crudeness of it&mdash;all spelling but
one thing, social misery, to him&mdash;that he at once retraced his
steps and recrossing the Mohawk by a bridge farther west soon found
himself in an area which was very different indeed&mdash;a region
once more of just such homes as he had been admiring before he left
for the factory. And walking still farther south, he came upon that
same wide and tree-lined avenue&mdash;which he had seen
before&mdash;the exterior appearance of which alone identified it
as the principal residence thoroughfare of Lycurgus. It was so very
broad and well-paved and lined by such an arresting company of
houses. At once he was very much alive to the personnel of this
street, for it came to him immediately that it must be in this
street very likely that his uncle Samuel lived. The houses were
nearly all of French, Italian or English design, and excellent
period copies at that, although he did not know it.</p>

<p>Impressed by their beauty and spaciousness, however, he walked
along, now looking at one and another, and wondering which, if any,
of these was occupied by his uncle, and deeply impressed by the
significance of so much wealth. How superior and condescending his
cousin Gilbert must feel, walking out of some such place as this in
the morning.</p>

<p>Then pausing before one which, because of trees, walks,
newly-groomed if bloomless flower beds, a large garage at the rear,
a large fountain to the left of the house as he faced it, in the
center of which was a boy holding a swan in his arms, and to the
right of the house one lone cast iron stag pursued by some cast
iron dogs, he felt especially impelled to admire, and charmed by
the dignity of this place, which was a modified form of old
English, he now inquired of a stranger who was passing&mdash;a
middle-aged man of a rather shabby working type, "Whose house is
that, mister?" and the man replied: "Why, that's Samuel Griffiths'
residence. He's the man who owns the big collar factory over the
river."</p>

<p>At once Clyde straightened up, as though dashed with cold water.
His uncle's! His residence! Then that was one of his automobiles
standing before the garage at the rear there. And there was another
visible through the open door of the garage.</p>

<p>Indeed in his immature and really psychically unilluminated mind
it suddenly evoked a mood which was as of roses, perfumes, lights
and music. The beauty! The ease! What member of his own immediate
family had ever even dreamed that his uncle lived thus! The
grandeur! And his own parents so wretched&mdash;so poor, preaching
on the streets of Kansas City and no doubt Denver. Conducting a
mission! And although thus far no single member of this family
other than his chill cousin had troubled to meet him, and that at
the factory only, and although he had been so indifferently
assigned to the menial type of work that he had, still he was
elated and uplifted. For, after all, was he not a Griffiths, a full
cousin as well as a full nephew to the two very important men who
lived here, and now working for them in some capacity at least? And
must not that spell a future of some sort, better than any he had
known as yet? For consider who the Griffiths were here, as opposed
to "who" the Griffiths were in Kansas City, say&mdash;or Denver.
The enormous difference! A thing to be as carefully concealed as
possible. At the same time, he was immediately reduced again, for
supposing the Griffiths here&mdash;his uncle or his cousin or some
friend or agent of theirs&mdash;should now investigate his parents
and his past? Heavens! The matter of that slain child in Kansas
City! His parents' miserable makeshift life! Esta! At once his face
fell, his dreams being so thickly clouded over. If they should
guess! If they should sense!</p>

<p>Oh, the devil&mdash;who was he anyway? And what did he really
amount to? What could he hope for from such a great world as this
really, once they knew why he had troubled to come here?</p>

<p>A little disgusted and depressed he turned to retrace his steps,
for all at once he felt himself very much of a nobody.</p>

<h3>Chapter 6</h3>

<p>The room which Clyde secured this same day with the aid of Mrs.
Braley, was in Thorpe Street, a thoroughfare enormously removed in
quality if not in distance from that in which his uncle resided.
Indeed the difference was sufficient to decidedly qualify his
mounting notions of himself as one who, after all, was connected
with him. The commonplace brown or gray or tan colored houses,
rather smoked or decayed, which fronted it&mdash;the leafless and
winter harried trees which in spite of smoke and dust seemed to
give promise of the newer life so near at hand&mdash;the leaves and
flowers of May. Yet as he walked into it with Mrs. Braley, many
drab and commonplace figures of men and girls, and elderly
spinsters resembling Mrs. Braley in kind, were making their way
home from the several factories beyond the river. And at the door
Mrs. Braley and himself were received by a none-too-polished woman
in a clean gingham apron over a dark brown dress, who led the way
to a second floor room, not too small or uncomfortably
furnished&mdash;which she assured him he could have for four
dollars without board or seven and one-half dollars with&mdash;a
proposition which, seeing that he was advised by Mrs. Braley that
this was somewhat better than he would get in most places for the
same amount, he decided to take. And here, after thanking Mrs.
Braley, he decided to remain&mdash;later sitting down to dinner
with a small group of mill-town store and factory employees, such
as partially he had been accustomed to in Paulina Street in
Chicago, before moving to the better atmosphere of the Union
League. And after dinner he made his way out into the principal
thoroughfares of Lycurgus, only to observe such a crowd of
nondescript mill-workers as, judging these streets by day, he would
not have fancied swarmed here by night&mdash;girls and boys, men
and women of various nationalities, and types&mdash;Americans,
Poles, Hungarians, French, English&mdash;and for the most
part&mdash;if not entirely touched with a peculiar
something&mdash;ignorance or thickness of mind or body, or with a
certain lack of taste and alertness or daring, which seemed to mark
them one and all as of the basement world which he had seen only
this afternoon. Yet in some streets and stores, particularly those
nearer Wykeagy Avenue, a better type of girl and young man who
might have been and no doubt were of the various office groups of
the different companies over the river&mdash; neat and active.</p>

<p>And Clyde, walking to and fro, from eight until ten, when as
though by pre-arrangement, the crowd in the more congested streets
seemed suddenly to fade away, leaving them quite vacant. And
throughout this time contrasting it all with Chicago and Kansas
City. (What would Ratterer think if he could see him now&mdash;his
uncle's great house and factory?) And perhaps because of its
smallness, liking it&mdash;the Lycurgus Hotel, neat and bright and
with a brisk local life seeming to center about it. And the
post-office and a handsomely spired church, together with an old
and interesting graveyard, cheek by jowl with an automobile
salesroom. And a new moving picture theater just around the corner
in a side street. And various boys and girls, men and women,
walking here and there, some of them flirting as Clyde could see.
And with a suggestion somehow hovering over it all of hope and zest
and youth&mdash;the hope and zest and youth that is at the bottom
of all the constructive energy of the world everywhere. And finally
returning to his room in Thorpe Street with the conclusion that he
did like the place and would like to stay here. That beautiful
Wykeagy Avenue! His uncle's great factory! The many pretty and
eager girls he had seen hurrying to and fro!<br>
<br></p>

<p>In the meantime, in so far as Gilbert Griffiths was concerned,
and in the absence of his father, who was in New York at the time
(a fact which Clyde did not know and of which Gilbert did not
trouble to inform him) he had conveyed to his mother and sisters
that he had met Clyde, and if he were not the dullest, certainly he
was not the most interesting person in the world, either.
Encountering Myra, as he first entered at five-thirty, the same day
that Clyde had appeared, he troubled to observe: "Well, that
Chicago cousin of ours blew in to-day."</p>

<p>"Yes!" commented Myra. "What's he like?" The fact that her
father had described Clyde as gentlemanly and intelligent had
interested her, although knowing Lycurgus and the nature of the
mill life here and its opportunities for those who worked in
factories such as her father owned, she had wondered why Clyde had
bothered to come.</p>

<p>"Well, I can't see that he's so much," replied Gilbert. "He's
fairly intelligent and not bad-looking, but he admits that he's
never had any business training of any kind. He's like all those
young fellows who work for hotels. He thinks clothes are the whole
thing, I guess. He had on a light brown suit and a brown tie and
hat to match and brown shoes. His tie was too bright and he had on
one of those bright pink striped shirts like they used to wear
three or four years ago. Besides his clothes aren't cut right. I
didn't want to say anything because he's just come on, and we don't
know whether he'll hold out or not. But if he does, and he's going
to pose around as a relative of ours, he'd better tone down, or I'd
advise the governor to have a few words with him. Outside of that I
guess he'll do well enough in one of the departments after a while,
as foreman or something. He might even be made into a salesman
later on, I suppose. But what he sees in all that to make it worth
while to come here is more than I can guess. As a matter of fact, I
don't think the governor made it clear to him just how few the
chances are here for any one who isn't really a wizard or
something."</p>

<p>He stood with his back to the large open fireplace.</p>

<p>"Oh, well, you know what Mother was saying the other day about
his father. She thinks Daddy feels that he's never had a chance in
some way. He'll probably do something for him whether he wants to
keep him in the mill or not. She told me that she thought that Dad
felt that his father hadn't been treated just right by their
father."</p>

<p>Myra paused, and Gilbert, who had had this same hint from his
mother before now, chose to ignore the implication of it.</p>

<p>"Oh, well, it's not my funeral," he went on. "If the governor
wants to keep him on here whether he's fitted for anything special
or not, that's his look-out. Only he's the one that's always
talking about efficiency in every department and cutting and
keeping out dead timber."</p>

<p>Meeting his mother and Bella later, he volunteered the same news
and much the same ideas. Mrs. Griffiths sighed; for after all, in a
place like Lycurgus and established as they were, any one related
to them and having their name ought to be most circumspect and have
careful manners and taste and judgment. It was not wise for her
husband to bring on any one who was not all of that and more.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Bella was by no means satisfied with the
accuracy of her brother's picture of Clyde. She did not know Clyde,
but she did know Gilbert, and as she knew he could decide very
swiftly that this or that person was lacking in almost every way,
when, as a matter of fact, they might not be at all as she saw
it.</p>

<p>"Oh, well," she finally observed, after hearing Gilbert comment
on more of Clyde's peculiarities at dinner, "if Daddy wants him, I
presume he'll keep him, or do something with him eventually." At
which Gilbert winced internally for this was a direct slap at his
assumed authority in the mill under his father, which authority he
was eager to make more and more effective in every direction, as
his younger sister well knew.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile on the following morning, Clyde, returning to
the mill, found that the name, or appearance, or both
perhaps&mdash;his resemblance to Mr. Gilbert Griffiths&mdash;was of
some peculiar advantage to him which he could not quite
sufficiently estimate at present. For on reaching number one
entrance, the doorman on guard there looked as though startled.</p>

<p>"Oh, you're Mr. Clyde Griffiths?" he queried. "You're goin' to
work under Mr. Kemerer? Yes, I know. Well, that man there will have
your key," and he pointed to a stodgy, stuffy old man whom later
Clyde came to know as "Old Jeff," the time-clock guard, who, at a
stand farther along this same hall, furnished and reclaimed all
keys between seven-thirty and seven-forty.</p>

<p>When Clyde approached him and said: "My name's Clyde Griffiths
and I'm to work downstairs with Mr. Kemerer," he too started and
then said: "Sure, that's right. Yes, sir. Here you are, Mr.
Griffiths. Mr. Kemerer spoke to me about you yesterday. Number
seventy-one is to be yours. I'm giving you Mr. Duveny's old key."
When Clyde had gone down the stairs into the shrinking department,
he turned to the doorman who had drawn near and exclaimed: "Don't
it beat all how much that fellow looks like Mr. Gilbert Griffiths?
Why, he's almost his spittin' image. What is he, do you suppose, a
brother or a cousin, or what?"</p>

<p>"Don't ask me," replied the doorman. "I never saw him before.
But he's certainly related to the family all right. When I seen him
first, I thought it was Mr. Gilbert. I was just about to tip my hat
to him when I saw it wasn't."</p>

<p>And in the shrinking room when he entered, as on the day before,
he found Kemerer as respectful and evasive as ever. For, like
Whiggam before him, Kemerer had not as yet been able to decide what
Clyde's true position with this company was likely to be. For, as
Whiggam had informed Kemerer the day before, Mr. Gilbert had said
no least thing which tended to make Mr. Whiggam believe that things
were to be made especially easy for him, nor yet hard, either. On
the contrary, Mr. Gilbert had said: "He's to be treated like all
the other employees as to time and work. No different." Yet in
introducing Clyde he had said: "This is my cousin, and he's going
to try to learn this business," which would indicate that as time
went on Clyde was to be transferred from department to department
until he had surveyed the entire manufacturing end of the
business.</p>

<p>Whiggam, for this reason, after Clyde had gone, whispered to
Kemerer as well as to several others, that Clyde might readily
prove to be some one who was a protege of the chief&mdash;and
therefore they determined to "watch their step," at least until
they knew what his standing here was to be. And Clyde, noticing
this, was quite set up by it, for he could not help but feel that
this in itself, and apart from whatever his cousin Gilbert might
either think or wish to do, might easily presage some favor on the
part of his uncle that might lead to some good for him. So when
Kemerer proceeded to explain to him that he was not to think that
the work was so very hard or that there was so very much to do for
the present, Clyde took it with a slight air of condescension. And
in consequence Kemerer was all the more respectful.</p>

<p>"Just hang up your hat and coat over there in one of those
lockers," he proceeded mildly and ingratiatingly even. "Then you
can take one of those crate trucks back there and go up to the next
floor and bring down some webs. They'll show you where to get
them."</p>

<p>The days that followed were diverting and yet troublesome enough
to Clyde, who to begin with was puzzled and disturbed at times by
the peculiar social and workaday worlds and position in which he
found himself. For one thing, those by whom now he found himself
immediately surrounded at the factory were not such individuals as
he would ordinarily select for companions&mdash;far below bell-boys
or drivers or clerks anywhere. They were, one and all, as he could
now clearly see, meaty or stodgy mentally and physically. They wore
such clothes as only the most common laborers would wear&mdash;such
clothes as are usually worn by those who count their personal
appearance among the least of their troubles&mdash;their work and
their heavy material existence being all. In addition, not knowing
just what Clyde was, or what his coming might mean to their
separate and individual positions, they were inclined to be dubious
and suspicious.</p>

<p>After a week or two, however, coming to understand that Clyde
was a nephew of the president, a cousin of the secretary of the
company, and hence not likely to remain here long in any menial
capacity, they grew more friendly, but inclined in the face of the
sense of subserviency which this inspired in them, to become
jealous and suspicious of him in another way. For, after all, Clyde
was not one of them, and under such circumstances could not be. He
might smile and be civil enough&mdash;yet he would always be in
touch with those who were above them, would he not&mdash;or so they
thought. He was, as they saw it, part of the rich and superior
class and every poor man knew what that meant. The poor must stand
together everywhere.</p>

<p>For his part, however, and sitting about for the first few days
in this particular room eating his lunch, he wondered how these men
could interest themselves in what were to him such dull and
uninteresting items&mdash;the quality of the cloth that was coming
down in the webs&mdash;some minute flaws in the matter of weight or
weave&mdash; the last twenty webs hadn't looked so closely shrunk
as the preceding sixteen; or the Cranston Wickwire Company was not
carrying as many men as it had the month before&mdash;or the
Anthony Woodenware Company had posted a notice that the Saturday
half-holiday would not begin before June first this year as opposed
to the middle of May last year. They all appeared to be lost in the
humdrum and routine of their work.</p>

<p>In consequence his mind went back to happier scenes. He wished
at times he were back in Chicago or Kansas City. He though of
Ratterer, Hegglund, Higby, Louise Ratterer, Larry Doyle, Mr.
Squires, Hortense&mdash;all of the young and thoughtless company of
which he had been a part, and wondered what they were doing. What
had become of Hortense? She had got that fur coat after all&mdash;
probably from that cigar clerk and then had gone away with him
after she had protested so much feeling for him&mdash;the little
beast. After she had gotten all that money out of him. The mere
thought of her and all that she might have meant to him if things
had not turned as they had, made him a little sick at times. To
whom was she being nice now? How had she found things since leaving
Kansas City? And what would she think if she saw him here now or
knew of his present high connections? Gee! That would cool her a
little. But she would not think much of his present position. That
was true. But she might respect him more if she could see his uncle
and his cousin and this factory and their big house. It would be
like her then to try to be nice to him. Well, he would show her, if
he ever ran into her again&mdash;snub her, of course, as no doubt
he very well could by then.</p>

<h3>Chapter 7</h3>

<p>In so far as his life at Mrs. Cuppy's went, he was not so very
happily placed there, either. For that was but a commonplace
rooming and boarding house, which drew to it, at best, such
conservative mill and business types as looked on work and their
wages, and the notions of the middle class religious world of
Lycurgus as most essential to the order and well being of the
world. From the point of view of entertainment or gayety, it was in
the main a very dull place.</p>

<p>At the same time, because of the presence of one Walter
Dillard&mdash;a brainless sprig who had recently come here from
Fonda, it was not wholly devoid of interest for Clyde. The
latter&mdash;a youth of about Clyde's own age and equally ambitious
socially&mdash;but without Clyde's tact or discrimination anent the
governing facts of life, was connected with the men's furnishing
department of Stark and Company. He was spry, avid, attractive
enough physically, with very light hair, a very light and feeble
mustache, and the delicate airs and ways of a small town Beau
Brummell. Never having had any social standing or the use of any
means whatsoever&mdash;his father having been a small town dry
goods merchant before him, who had failed&mdash;he was, because of
some atavistic spur or fillip in his own blood, most anxious to
attain some sort of social position.</p>

<p>But failing that so far, he was interested in and envious of
those who had it&mdash;much more so than Clyde, even. The glory and
activity of the leading families of this particular city had
enormous weight with him&mdash;the Nicholsons, the Starks, the
Harriets, Griffiths, Finchleys, et cetera. And learning a few days
after Clyde's arrival of his somewhat left-handed connection with
this world, he was most definitely interested. What? A Griffiths!
The nephew of the rich Samuel Griffiths of Lycurgus! And in this
boarding house! Beside him at this table! At once his interest rose
to where he decided that he must cultivate this stranger as
speedily as possible. Here was a real social opportunity knocking
at his very door&mdash;a connecting link to one of the very best
families! And besides was he not young, attractive and probably
ambitious like himself&mdash;a fellow to play around with if one
could? He proceeded at once to make overtures to Clyde. It seemed
almost too good to be true.</p>

<p>In consequence he was quick to suggest a walk, the fact that
there was a certain movie just on at the Mohawk, which was
excellent&mdash; very snappy. Didn't Clyde want to go? And because
of his neatness, smartness&mdash;a touch of something that was far
from humdrum or the heavy practicality of the mill and the
remainder of this boarding house world, Clyde was inclined to fall
in with him.</p>

<p>But, as he now thought, here were his great relatives and he
must watch his step here. Who knew but that he might be making a
great mistake in holding such free and easy contacts as this. The
Griffiths&mdash;as well as the entire world of which they were a
part&mdash; as he guessed from the general manner of all those who
even contacted him, must be very removed from the commonalty here.
More by instinct than reason, he was inclined to stand off and look
very superior&mdash;more so since those, including this very youth
on whom he practised this seemed to respect him the more. And
although upon eager&mdash;and even&mdash;after its fashion,
supplicating request, he now went with this youth&mdash;still he
went cautiously. And his aloof and condescending manner Dillard at
once translated as "class" and "connection." And to think he had
met him in this dull, dubby boarding house here. And on his
arrival&mdash;at the very inception of his career here.</p>

<p>And so his manner was that of the sycophant&mdash;although he
had a better position and was earning more money than Clyde was at
this time, twenty-two dollars a week.</p>

<p>"I suppose you'll be spending a good deal of your time with your
relatives and friends here," he volunteered on the occasion of
their first walk together, and after he had extracted as much
information as Clyde cared to impart, which was almost nothing,
while he volunteered a few, most decidedly furbished bits from his
own history. His father owned a dry goods store <i>now</i>. He had
come over here to study other methods, et cetera. He had an uncle
here&mdash; connected with Stark and Company. He had met a
few&mdash;not so many as yet&mdash;nice people here, since he
hadn't been here so very long himself&mdash;four months all
told.</p>

<p>But Clyde's relatives!</p>

<p>"Say your uncle must be worth over a million, isn't he? They say
he is. Those houses in Wykeagy Avenue are certainly the cats'. You
won't see anything finer in Albany or Utica or Rochester either.
Are you Samuel Griffiths' own nephew? You don't say! Well, that'll
certainly mean a lot to you here. I wish I had a connection like
that. You bet I'd make it count."</p>

<p>He beamed on Clyde eagerly and hopefully, and through him Clyde
sensed even more how really important this blood relation was. Only
think how much it meant to this strange youth.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know," replied Clyde dubiously, and yet very much
flattered by this assumption of intimacy. "I came on to learn the
collar business, you know. Not to play about very much. My uncle
wants me to stick to that, pretty much."</p>

<p>"Sure, sure. I know how that is," replied Dillard, "that's the
way my uncle feels about me, too. He wants me to stick close to the
work here and not play about very much. He's the buyer for Stark
and Company, you know. But still a man can't work all the time,
either. He's got to have a little fun."</p>

<p>"Yes, that's right," said Clyde&mdash;for the first time in his
life a little condescendingly.</p>

<p>They walked along in silence for a few moments. Then:</p>

<p>"Do you dance?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Clyde.</p>

<p>"Well, so do I. There are a lot of cheap dance halls around
here, but I never go to any of those. You can't do it and keep in
with the nice people. This is an awfully close town that way, they
say. The best people won't have anything to do with you unless you
go with the right crowd. It's the same way up at Fonda. You have to
'belong' or you can't go out anywhere at all. And that's right, I
guess. But still there are a lot of nice girls here that a fellow
can go with&mdash;girls of right nice families&mdash;not in
society, of course&mdash;but still, they're not talked about, see.
And they're not so slow, either. Pretty hot stuff, some of them.
And you don't have to marry any of 'em, either." Clyde began to
think of him as perhaps a little too lusty for his new life here,
maybe. At the same time he liked him some. "By the way," went on
Dillard, "what are you doing next Sunday afternoon?"</p>

<p>"Well, nothing in particular, that I know of just now," replied
Clyde, sensing a new problem here. "I don't know just what I may
have to do by then, but I don't know of anything now."</p>

<p>"Well, how'd you like to come with me, if you're not too busy.
I've come to know quite a few girls since I've been here. Nice
ones. I can take you out and introduce you to my uncle's family, if
you like. They're nice people. And afterwards&mdash;I know two
girls we can go and see&mdash;peaches. One of 'em did work in the
store, but she don't now&mdash;she's not doing anything now. The
other is her pal. They have a Victrola and they can dance. I know
it isn't the thing to dance here on Sundays but no one need know
anything about that. The girls' parents don't mind. Afterwards we
might take 'em to a movie or something&mdash;if you want
to&mdash;not any of those things down near the mill district but
one of the better ones&mdash;see?"</p>

<p>There formulated itself in Clyde's mind the question as to what,
in regard to just such proposals as this, his course here was to
be. In Chicago, and recently&mdash;because of what happened in
Kansas City&mdash; he had sought to be as retiring and cautious as
possible. For&mdash; after that and while connected with the club,
he had been taken with the fancy of trying to live up to the ideals
with which the seemingly stern face of that institution had
inspired him&mdash; conservatism&mdash;hard work&mdash;saving one's
money&mdash;looking neat and gentlemanly. It was such an Eveless
paradise, that.</p>

<p>In spite of his quiet surroundings here, however, the very air
of the city seemed to suggest some such relaxation as this youth
was now suggesting&mdash;a form of diversion that was probably
innocent enough but still connected with girls and their
entertainment&mdash; there were so many of them here, as he could
see. These streets, after dinner, here, were so alive with
good-looking girls, and young men, too. But what might his new
found relatives think of him in case he was seen stepping about in
the manner and spirit which this youth's suggestions seemed to
imply? Hadn't he just said that this was an awfully close town and
that everybody knew nearly everything about everybody else? He
paused in doubt. He must decide now. And then, being lonely and
hungry for companionship, he replied:</p>

<p>"Yes,&mdash;well&mdash;I think that's all right." But he added a
little dubiously: "Of course my relatives here&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, sure, that's all right," replied Dillard smartly. "You have
to be careful, of course. Well, so do I." If he could only go
around with a Griffiths, even if he was new around here and didn't
know many people&mdash;wouldn't it reflect a lot of credit on him?
It most certainly would&mdash;did already, as he saw it.</p>

<p>And forthwith he offered to buy Clyde some cigarettes&mdash;a
soda&mdash; anything he liked. But Clyde, still feeling very
strange and uncertain, excused himself, after a time, because this
youth with his complacent worship of society and position, annoyed
him a little, and made his way back to his room. He had promised
his mother a letter and he thought he had better go back and write
it, and incidentally to think a little on the wisdom of this new
contact.</p>

<h3>Chapter 8</h3>

<p>Nevertheless, the next day being a Saturday and half holiday the
year round in this concern, Mr. Whiggam came through with the pay
envelopes.</p>

<p>"Here you are, Mr. Griffiths," he said, as though he were
especially impressed with Clyde's position.</p>

<p>Clyde, taking it, was rather pleased with this mistering, and
going back toward his locker, promptly tore it open and pocketed
the money. After that, taking his hat and coat, he wandered off in
the direction of his room, where he had his lunch. But, being very
lonely, and Dillard not being present because he had to work, he
decided upon a trolley ride to Gloversville, which was a city of
some twenty thousand inhabitants and reported to be as active, if
not as beautiful, as Lycurgus. And that trip amused and interested
him because it took him into a city very different form Lycurgus in
its social texture.</p>

<p>But the next day&mdash;Sunday&mdash;he spent idly in Lycurgus,
wandering about by himself. For, as it turned out, Dillard was
compelled to return to Fonda for some reason and could not fulfill
the Sunday understanding. Encountering Clyde, however, on Monday
evening, he announced that on the following Wednesday evening, in
the basement of the Diggby Avenue Congregational Church, there was
to be held a social with refreshments. And according to young
Dillard, at least this promised to prove worth while.</p>

<p>"We can just go out there," was the way he put it to Clyde, and
buzz the girls a little. "I want you to meet my uncle and aunt.
They're nice people all right. And so are the girls. They're no
slouches. Then we can edge out afterwards, about ten, see, and go
around to either Zella or Rita's place. Rita has more good records
over at her place, but Zella has the nicest place to dance. By the
way, you didn't chance to bring along your dress suit with you, did
you?" he inquired. For having already inspected Clyde's room, which
was above his own on the third floor, in Clyde's absence and having
discovered that he had only a dress suit case and no trunk, and
apparently no dress suit anywhere, he had decided that in spite of
Clyde's father conducting a hotel and Clyde having worked in the
Union League Club in Chicago, he must be very indifferent to social
equipment. Or, if not, must be endeavoring to make his own way on
some character-building plan without help from any one. This was
not to his liking, exactly. A man should never neglect these social
essentials. Nevertheless, Clyde was a Griffiths and that was enough
to cause him to overlook nearly anything, for the present
anyhow.</p>

<p>"No, I didn't," replied Clyde, who was not exactly sure as to
the value of this adventure&mdash;even yet&mdash;in spite of his
own loneliness,&mdash; "but I intend to get one." He had already
thought since coming here of his lack in this respect, and was
thinking of taking at least thirty-five of his more recently
hard-earned savings and indulging in a suit of this kind.</p>

<p>Dillard buzzed on about the fact that while Zella Shuman's
family wasn't rich&mdash;they owned the house they lived
in&mdash;still she went with a lot of nice girls here, too. So did
Rita Dickerman. Zella's father owned a little cottage upon Eckert
Lake, near Fonda. When next summer came&mdash;and with it the
holidays and pleasant week-ends, he and Clyde, supposing that Clyde
liked Rita, might go up there some time for a visit, for Rita and
Zella were inseparable almost. And they were pretty, too. "Zella's
dark and Rita's light," he added enthusiastically.</p>

<p>Clyde was interested by the fact that the girls were pretty and
that out of a clear sky and in the face of his present loneliness,
he was being made so much of by this Dillard. But, was it wise for
him to become very much involved with him? That was the
question&mdash; for, after all, he really knew nothing of him. And
he gathered from Dillard's manner, his flighty enthusiasm for the
occasion, that he was far more interested in the girls as
girls&mdash;a certain freedom or concealed looseness that
characterized them&mdash;than he was in the social phase of the
world which they represented. And wasn't that what brought about
his downfall in Kansas City? Here in Lycurgus, of all places, he
was least likely to forget it&mdash; aspiring to something better
as he now did.</p>

<p>None-the-less, at eight-thirty on the following Wednesday
evening&mdash; they were off, Clyde full of eager anticipation. And
by nine o'clock they were in the midst of one of those
semi-religious, semi-social and semi-emotional church affairs, the
object of which was to raise money for the church&mdash;the general
service of which was to furnish an occasion for gossip among the
elders, criticism and a certain amount of enthusiastic, if
disguised courtship and flirtation among the younger members. There
were booths for the sale of quite everything from pies, cakes and
ice cream to laces, dolls and knickknacks of every description,
supplied by the members and parted with for the benefit of the
church. The Reverend Peter Isreals, the minister, and his wife were
present. Also Dillard's uncle and aunt, a pair of brisk and yet
uninteresting people whom Clyde could sense were of no importance
socially here. They were too genial and altogether social in the
specific neighborhood sense, although Grover Wilson, being a buyer
for Stark and Company, endeavored to assume a serious and important
air at times.</p>

<p>He was an undersized and stocky man who did not seem to know how
to dress very well or could not afford it. In contrast to his
nephew's almost immaculate garb, his own suit was far from
perfect-fitting. It was unpressed and slightly soiled. And his tie
the same. He had a habit of rubbing his hands in a clerkly fashion,
of wrinkling his brows and scratching the back of his head at
times, as though something he was about to say had cost him great
thought and was of the utmost importance. Whereas, nothing that he
uttered, as even Clyde could see, was of the slightest
importance.</p>

<p>And so, too, with the stout and large Mrs. Wilson, who stood
beside him while he was attempting to rise to the importance of
Clyde. She merely beamed a fatty beam. She was almost ponderous,
and pink, with a tendency to a double chin. She smiled and smiled,
largely because she was naturally genial and on her good behavior
here, but incidentally because Clyde was who he was. For as Clyde
himself could see, Walter Dillard had lost no time in impressing
his relatives with the fact that he was a Griffiths. Also that he
had encountered and made a friend of him and that he was now
chaperoning him locally.</p>

<p>"Walter has been telling us that you have just come on here to
work for your uncle. You're at Mrs. Cuppy's now, I understand. I
don't know her but I've always heard she keeps such a nice, refined
place. Mr. Parsley, who lives here with her, used to go to school
with me. But I don't see much of him any more. Did you meet him
yet?"</p>

<p>"No, I didn't," said Clyde in return.</p>

<p>"Well, you know, we expected you last Sunday to dinner, only
Walter had to go home. But you must come soon. Any time at all. I
would love to have you." She beamed and her small grayish brown
eyes twinkled.</p>

<p>Clyde could see that because of the fame of his uncle he was
looked upon as a social find, really. And so it was with the
remainder of this company, old and young&mdash;the Rev. Peter
Isreals and his wife; Mr. Micah Bumpus, a local vendor of printing
inks, and his wife and son; Mr. and Mrs. Maximilian Pick, Mr. Pick
being a wholesale and retail dealer in hay, grain and feed; Mr.
Witness, a florist, and Mrs. Throop, a local real estate dealer.
All knew Samuel Griffiths and his family by reputation and it
seemed not a little interesting and strange to all of them that
Clyde, a real nephew of so rich a man, should be here in their
midst. The only trouble with this was that Clyde's manner was very
soft and not as impressive as it should be&mdash;not so aggressive
and contemptuous. And most of them were of that type of mind that
respects insolence even where it pretends to condemn it.</p>

<p>In so far as the young girls were concerned, it was even more
noticeable. For Dillard was making this important relationship of
Clyde's perfectly plain to every one. "This is Clyde Griffiths, the
nephew of Samuel Griffiths, Mr. Gilbert Griffiths' cousin, you
know. He's just come on here to study the collar business in his
uncle's factory." And Clyde, who realized how shallow was this
pretense, was still not a little pleased and impressed by the
effect of it all. This Dillard's effrontery. The brassy way in
which, because of Clyde, he presumed to patronize these people. On
this occasion, he kept guiding Clyde here and there, refusing for
the most part to leave him alone for an instant. In fact he was
determined that all whom he knew and liked among the girls and
young men should know who and what Clyde was and that he was
presenting him. Also that those whom he did not like should see as
little of him as possible&mdash;not be introduced at all. "She
don't amount to anything. Her father only keeps a small garage
here. I wouldn't bother with her if I were you." Or, "He isn't much
around here. Just a clerk in our store." At the same time, in
regard to some others, he was all smiles and compliments, or at
worst apologetic for their social lacks.</p>

<p>And then he was introduced to Zella Shuman and Rita Dickerman,
who, for reasons of their own, not the least among which was a
desire to appear a little wise and more sophisticated than the
others here, came a little late. And it was true, as Clyde was to
find out afterwards, that they were different, too&mdash;less
simple and restricted than quite all of the girls whom Dillard had
thus far introduced him to. They were not as sound religiously and
morally as were these others. And as even Clyde noted on meeting
them, they were as keen for as close an approach to pagan pleasure
without admitting it to themselves, as it was possible to be and
not be marked for what they were. And in consequence, there was
something in their manner, the very spirit of the introduction,
which struck him as different from the tone of the rest of this
church group&mdash;not exactly morally or religiously unhealthy but
rather much freer, less repressed, less reserved than were these
others.</p>

<p>"Oh, so you're Mr. Clyde Griffiths," observed Zella Shuman. "My,
you look a lot like your cousin, don't you? I see him driving down
Central Avenue ever so often. Walter has been telling us all about
you. Do you like Lycurgus?"</p>

<p>The way she said "Walter," together with something intimate and
possessive in the tone of her voice, caused Clyde to feel at once
that she must feel rather closer to and freer with Dillard than he
himself had indicated. A small scarlet bow of velvet ribbon at her
throat, two small garnet earrings in her ears, a very trim and
tight-fitting black dress, with a heavily flounced skirt, seemed to
indicate that she was not opposed to showing her figure, and prized
it, a mood which except for a demure and rather retiring poise
which she affected, would most certainly have excited comment in
such a place as this.</p>

<p>Rita Dickerman, on the other hand, was lush and blonde, with
pink cheeks, light chestnut hair, and bluish gray eyes. Lacking the
aggressive smartness which characterized Zella Shuman, she still
radiated a certain something which to Clyde seemed to harmonize
with the liberal if secret mood of her friend. Her manner, as Clyde
could see, while much less suggestive of masked bravado was
yielding and to him designedly so, as well as naturally
provocative. It had been arranged that she was to intrigue him.
Very much fascinated by Zella Shuman and in tow of her, they were
inseparable. And when Clyde was introduced to her, she beamed upon
him in a melting and sensuous way which troubled him not a little.
For here in Lycurgus, as he was telling himself at the time, he
must be very careful with whom he became familiar. And yet,
unfortunately, as in the case of Hortense Briggs, she evoked
thoughts of intimacy, however unproblematic or distant, which
troubled him. But he must be careful. It was just such a free
attitude as this suggested by Dillard as well as these girls'
manners that had gotten him into trouble before.</p>

<p>"Now we'll just have a little ice cream and cake," suggested
Dillard, after the few preliminary remarks were over, "and then we
can get out of here. You two had better go around together and hand
out a few hellos. Then we can meet at the ice cream booth. After
that, if you say so, we'll leave, eh? What do you say?"</p>

<p>He looked at Zella Shuman as much as to say: "You know what is
the best thing to do," and she smiled and replied:</p>

<p>"That's right. We can't leave right away. I see my cousin Mary
over there. And Mother. And Fred Bruckner. Rita and I'll just go
around by ourselves for a while and then we'll meet you, see." And
Rita Dickerman forthwith bestowed upon Clyde an intimate and
possessive smile.</p>

<p>After about twenty minutes of drifting and browsing, Dillard
received some signal from Zella, and he and Clyde paused near the
ice cream booth with its chairs in the center of the room. In a few
moments they were casually joined by Zella and Rita, with whom they
had some ice cream and cake. And then, being free of all
obligations and as some of the others were beginning to depart,
Dillard observed: "Let's beat it. We can go over to your place,
can't we?"</p>

<p>"Sure, sure," whispered Zella, and together they made their way
to the coat room. Clyde was still so dubious as to the wisdom of
all this that he was inclined to be a little silent. He did not
know whether he was fascinated by Rita or not. But once out in the
street out of view of the church and the homing amusement seekers,
he and Rita found themselves together, Zella and Dillard having
walked on ahead. And although Clyde had taken her arm, as he
thought fit, she maneuvered it free and laid a warm and caressing
hand on his elbow. And she nudged quite close to him, shoulder to
shoulder, and half leaning on him, began pattering of the life of
Lycurgus.</p>

<p>There was something very furry and caressing about her voice
now. Clyde liked it. There was something heavy and languorous about
her body, a kind of ray or electron that intrigued and lured him in
spite of himself. He felt that he would like to caress her arm and
might if he wished&mdash;that he might even put his arm around her
waist, and so soon. Yet here he was, a Griffiths, he was shrewd
enough to think&mdash;a Lycurgus Griffiths&mdash;and that was what
now made a difference&mdash;that made all those girls at this
church social seem so much more interested in him and so friendly.
Yet in spite of this thought, he did squeeze her arm ever so
slightly and without reproach or comment from her.</p>

<p>And once in the Shuman home, which was a large old-fashioned
square frame house with a square cupola, very retired among some
trees and a lawn, they made themselves at home in a general living
room which was much more handsomely furnished than any home with
which Clyde had been identified heretofore. Dillard at once began
sorting the records, with which he seemed most familiar, and to
pull two rather large rugs out of the way, revealing a smooth,
hardwood floor.</p>

<p>"There's one thing about this house and these trees and these
soft-toned needles," he commented for Clyde's benefit, of course,
since he was still under the impression that Clyde might be and
probably was a very shrewd person who was watching his every move
here. "You can't hear a note of this Victrola out in the street,
can you, Zell? Nor upstairs, either, really, not with the soft
needles. We've played it down here and danced to it several times,
until three and four in the morning and they didn't even know it
upstairs, did they, Zell?"</p>

<p>"That's right. But then Father's a little hard of hearing. And
Mother don't hear anything, either, when she gets in her room and
gets to reading. But it is hard to hear at that."</p>

<p>"Why do people object so to dancing here?" asked Clyde.</p>

<p>"Oh, they don't&mdash;not the factory people&mdash;not at all,"
put in Dillard, "but most of the church people do. My uncle and
aunt do. And nearly everyone else we met at the church to-night,
except Zell and Rita." He gave them a most approving and
encouraging glance. "And they're too broadminded to let a little
thing like that bother them. Ain't that right, Zell?"</p>

<p>This young girl, who was very much fascinated by him, laughed
and nodded, "You bet, that's right. I can't see any harm in
it."</p>

<p>"Nor me, either," put in Rita, "nor my father and mother. Only
they don't like to say anything about it or make me feel that they
want me to do too much of it."</p>

<p>Dillard by then had started a piece entitled "Brown Eyes" and
immediately Clyde and Rita and Dillard and Zella began to dance,
and Clyde found himself insensibly drifting into a kind of intimacy
with this girl which boded he could scarcely say what. She danced
so warmly and enthusiastically&mdash;a kind of weaving and swaying
motion which suggested all sorts of repressed enthusiasms. And her
lips were at once wreathed with a kind of lyric smile which
suggested a kind of hunger for this thing. And she was very pretty,
more so dancing and smiling than at any other time.</p>

<p>"She is delicious," thought Clyde, "even if she is a little
soft. Any fellow would do almost as well as me, but she likes me
because she thinks I'm somebody." And almost at the same moment she
observed: "Isn't it just too gorgeous? And you're such a good
dancer, Mr. Griffiths."</p>

<p>"Oh, no," he replied, smiling into her eyes, "you're the one
that's the dancer. I can dance because you're dancing with me."</p>

<p>He could feel now that her arms were large and soft, her bosom
full for one so young. Exhilarated by dancing, she was quite
intoxicating, her gestures almost provoking.</p>

<p>"Now we'll put on 'The Love Boat,'" called Dillard the moment
"Brown Eyes" was ended, "and you and Zella can dance together and
Rita and I will have a spin, eh, Rita?"</p>

<p>He was so fascinated by his own skill as a dancer, however, as
well as his natural joy in the art, that he could scarcely wait to
begin another, but must take Rita by the arms before putting on
another record, gliding here and there, doing steps and executing
figures which Clyde could not possibly achieve and which at once
established Dillard as the superior dancer. Then, having done so,
he called to Clyde to put on "The Love Boat."</p>

<p>But as Clyde could see after dancing with Zella once, this was
planned to be a happy companionship of two mutually mated couples
who would not interfere with each other in any way, but rather
would aid each other in their various schemes to enjoy one
another's society. For while Zella danced with Clyde, and danced
well and talked to him much, all the while he could feel that she
was interested in Dillard and Dillard only and would prefer to be
with him. For, after a few dances, and while he and Rita lounged on
a settee and talked, Zella and Dillard left the room to go to the
kitchen for a drink. Only, as Clyde observed, they stayed much
longer than any single drink would have required.</p>

<p>And similarly, during this interval, it seemed as though it was
intended even, by Rita, that he and she should draw closer to one
another. For, finding the conversation on the settee lagging for a
moment, she got up and apropos of nothing&mdash;no music and no
words&mdash; motioned him to dance some more with her. She had
danced certain steps with Dillard which she pretended to show
Clyde. But because of their nature, these brought her and Clyde
into closer contact than before&mdash;very much so. And standing so
close together and showing Clyde by elbow and arm how to do, her
face and cheek came very close to him&mdash;too much for his own
strength of will and purpose. He pressed his cheek to hers and she
turned smiling and encouraging eyes upon him. On the instant, his
self-possession was gone and he kissed her lips. And then
again&mdash;and again. And instead of withdrawing them, as he
thought she might, she let him&mdash; remained just as she was in
order that he might kiss her more.</p>

<p>And suddenly now, as he felt this yielding of her warm body so
close to him, and the pressure of her lips in response to his own,
he realized that he had let himself in for a relationship which
might not be so very easy to modify or escape. Also that it would
be a very difficult thing for him to resist, since he now liked her
and obviously she liked him.</p>

<h3>Chapter 9</h3>

<p>Apart from the momentary thrill and zest of this, the effect was
to throw Clyde, as before, speculatively back upon the problem of
his proper course here. For here was this girl, and she was
approaching him in this direct and suggestive way. And so soon
after telling himself and his mother that his course was to be so
different here&mdash;no such approaches or relationships as had
brought on his downfall in Kansas City. And yet&mdash;and
yet&mdash;</p>

<p>He was sorely tempted now, for in his contact with Rita he had
the feeling that she was expecting him to suggest a further
step&mdash;and soon. But just how and where? Not in connection with
this large, strange house. There were other rooms apart from the
kitchen to which Dillard and Zella had ostensibly departed. But
even so, such a relationship once established! What then? Would he
not be expected to continue it, or let himself in for possible
complications in case he did not? He danced with and fondled her in
a daring and aggressive fashion, yet thinking as he did so, "But
this is not what I should be doing either, is it? This is Lycurgus.
I am a Griffiths, here. I know how these people feel toward
me&mdash;their parents even. Do I really care for her? Is there not
something about her quick and easy availability which, if not
exactly dangerous in so far as my future here is concerned, is not
quite satisfactory&mdash;too quickly intimate?" He was experiencing
a sensation not unrelated to his mood in connection with the
lupanar in Kansas City&mdash;attracted and yet repulsed. He could
do no more than kiss and fondle her here in a somewhat restrained
way until at last Dillard and Zella returned, whereupon the same
degree of intimacy was no longer possible.</p>

<p>A clock somewhere striking two, it suddenly occurred to Rita
that she must be going&mdash;her parents would object to her
staying out so late. And since Diliard gave no evidence of
deserting Zella, it followed, of course, that Clyde was to see her
home, a pleasure that now had been allayed by a vague suggestion of
disappointment or failure on the part of both. He had not risen to
her expectations, he thought. Obviously he lacked the courage yet
to follow up the proffer of her favors, was the way she explained
it to herself.</p>

<p>At her own door, not so far distant, and with a conversation
which was still tinctured with intimations of some future occasions
which might prove more favorable, her attitude was decidedly
encouraging, even here. They parted, but with Clyde still saying to
himself that this new relationship was developing much too swiftly.
He was not sure that he should undertake a relationship such as
this here&mdash; so soon, anyhow. Where now were all his fine
decisions made before coming here? What was he going to decide? And
yet because of the sensual warmth and magnetism of Rita, he was
irritated by his resolution and his inability to proceed as he
otherwise might.</p>

<p>Two things which eventually decided him in regard to this came
quite close together. One related to the attitude of the Griffiths
themselves, which, apart from that of Gilbert, was not one of
opposition or complete indifference, so much as it was a failure on
the part of Samuel Griffiths in the first instance and the others
largely because of him to grasp the rather anomalous, if not
exactly lonely position in which Clyde would find himself here
unless the family chose to show him at least some little courtesy
or advise him cordially from time to time. Yet Samuel Griffiths,
being always very much pressed for time, had scarcely given Clyde a
thought during the first month, at least. He was here, properly
placed, as he heard, would be properly looked after in the
future,&mdash; what more, just now, at least?</p>

<p>And so for all of five weeks before any action of any kind was
taken, and with Gilbert Griffiths comforted thereby, Clyde was
allowed to drift along in his basement world wondering what was
being intended in connection with himself. The attitude of others,
including Dillard and these girls, finally made his position here
seem strange.</p>

<p>However, about a month after Clyde had arrived, and principally
because Gilbert seemed so content to say nothing regarding him, the
elder Griffiths inquired one day:</p>

<p>"Well, what about your cousin? How's he doing by now?" And
Gilbert, only a little worried as to what this might bode, replied,
"Oh, he's all right. I started him off in the shrinking room. Is
that all right?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I think so. That's as good a place as any for him to
begin, I believe. But what do you think of him by now?"</p>

<p>"Oh," answered Gilbert very conservatively and decidedly
independently&mdash;a trait for which his father had always admired
him&mdash; "Not so much. He's all right, I guess. He may work out.
But he does not strike me as a fellow who would ever make much of a
stir in this game. He hasn't had much of an education of any kind,
you know. Any one can see that. Besides, he's not so very
aggressive or energetic-looking. Too soft, I think. Still I don't
want to knock him. He may be all right. You like him and I may be
wrong. But I can't help but think that his real idea in coming here
is that you'll do more for him than you would for someone else,
just because he is related to you."</p>

<p>"Oh, you think he does. Well, if he does, he's wrong." But at
the same time, he added, and that with a bantering smile: "He may
not be as impractical as you think, though. He hasn't been here
long enough for us to really tell, has he? He didn't strike me that
way in Chicago. Besides there are a lot of little corners into
which he might fit, aren't there, without any great waste, even if
he isn't the most talented fellow in the world? If he's content to
take a small job in life, that's his business. I can't prevent
that. But at any rate, I don't want him sent away yet, anyhow, and
I don't want him put on piece work. It wouldn't look right. After
all, he is related to us. Just let him drift along for a little
while and see what he does for himself."</p>

<p>"All right, governor," replied his son, who was hoping that his
father would absent-mindedly let him stay where he was&mdash;in the
lowest of all the positions the factory had to offer.</p>

<p>But, now, and to his dissatisfaction, Samuel Griffiths proceeded
to add, "We'll have to have him out to the house for dinner pretty
soon, won't we? I have thought of that but I haven't been able to
attend to it before. I should have spoken to Mother about it before
this. He hasn't been out yet, has he?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, not that I know of," replied Gilbert dourly. He did
not like this at all, but was too tactful to show his opposition
just here. "We've been waiting for you to say something about it, I
suppose."</p>

<p>"Very well," went on Samuel, "you'd better find out where he's
stopping and have him out. Next Sunday wouldn't be a bad time, if
we haven't anything else on." Noting a flicker of doubt or
disapproval in his son's eyes, he added: "After all, Gil, he's my
nephew and your cousin, and we can't afford to ignore him entirely.
That wouldn't be right, you know, either. You'd better speak to
your mother to-night, or I will, and arrange it." He closed the
drawer of a desk in which he had been looking for certain papers,
got up and took down his hat and coat and left the office.</p>

<p>In consequence of this discussion, an invitation was sent to
Clyde for the following Sunday at six-thirty to appear and
participate in a Griffiths family meal. On Sunday at one-thirty was
served the important family dinner to which usually was invited one
or another of the various local or visiting friends of the family.
At six-thirty nearly all of these guests had departed, and
sometimes one or two of the Griffiths themselves, the cold
collation served being partaken of by Mr. and Mrs. Griffiths and
Myra&mdash;Bella and Gilbert usually having appointments
elsewhere.</p>

<p>On this occasion, however, as Mrs. Griffiths and Myra and Bella
decided in conference, they would all be present with the exception
of Gilbert, who, because of his opposition as well as another
appointment, explained that he would stop in for only a moment
before leaving. Thus Clyde as Gilbert was pleased to note would be
received and entertained without the likelihood of contacts,
introductions and explanations to such of their more important
connections who might chance to stop in during the afternoon. They
would also have an opportunity to study him for themselves and see
what they really did think without committing themselves in any
way.</p>

<p>But in the meantime in connection with Dillard, Rita and Zella
there had been a development which, because of the problem it had
posed, was to be affected by this very decision on the part of the
Griffiths. For following the evening at the Shuman home, and
because, in spite of Clyde's hesitation at the time, all three
including Rita herself, were still convinced that he must or would
be smitten with her charms, there had been various hints, as well
as finally a direct invitation or proposition on the part of
Dillard to the effect that because of the camaraderie which had
been established between himself and Clyde and these two girls,
they make a week-end trip somewhere&mdash;preferably to Utica or
Albany. The girls would go, of course. He could fix that through
Zella with Rita for Clyde if he had any doubts or fears as to
whether it could be negotiated or not. "You know she likes you.
Zell was telling me the other day that she said she thought you
were the candy. Some ladies' man, eh?" And he nudged Clyde genially
and intimately,&mdash;a proceeding in this newer and grander world
in which he now found himself,&mdash;and considering who he was
here, was not as appealing to Clyde as it otherwise might have
been. These fellows who were so pushing where they thought a fellow
amounted to something more than they did! He could tell.</p>

<p>At the same time, the proposition he was now offering&mdash;as
thrilling and intriguing as it might be from one point of
view&mdash;was likely to cause him endless trouble&mdash;was it
not? In the first place he had no money&mdash;only fifteen dollars
a week here so far&mdash;and if he was going to be expected to
indulge in such expensive outings as these, why, of course, he
could not manage. Carfare, meals, a hotel bill, maybe an automobile
ride or two. And after that he would be in close contact with this
Rita whom he scarcely knew. And might she not take it on herself to
become intimate here in Lycurgus, maybe&mdash; expect him to call
on her regularly&mdash;and go places&mdash;and then&mdash;well,
gee&mdash;supposing the Griffiths&mdash;his cousin Gilbert, heard
of or saw this. Hadn't Zella said that she saw him often on the
street here and there in Lycurgus? And wouldn't they be likely to
encounter him somewhere&mdash;sometime&mdash;when they were all
together? And wouldn't that fix him as being intimate with just
another store clerk like Dillard who didn't amount to so much after
all? It might even mean the end of his career here! Who could tell
what it might lead to?</p>

<p>He coughed and made various excuses. Just now he had a lot of
work to do. Besides&mdash;a venture like that&mdash;he would have
to see first. His relatives, you know. Besides next Sunday and the
Sunday after, some extra work in connection with the factory was
going to hold him in Lycurgus. After that time he would see.
Actually, in his wavering way&mdash;and various disturbing thoughts
as to Rita's charm returning to him at moments, he was wondering if
it was not desirable&mdash;his other decision to the contrary
notwithstanding, to skimp himself as much as possible over two or
three weeks and so go anyhow. He had been saving something toward a
new dress suit and collapsible silk hat. Might he not use some of
that&mdash;even though he knew the plan to be all wrong?</p>

<p>The fair, plump, sensuous Rita!</p>

<p>But then, not at that very moment&mdash;but in the interim
following, the invitation from the Griffiths. Returning from his
work one evening very tired and still cogitating this gay adventure
proposed by Dillard, he found lying on the table in his room a note
written on very heavy and handsome paper which had been delivered
by one of the servants of the Griffiths in his absence. It was all
the more arresting to him because on the flap of the envelope was
embossed in high relief the initials "E. G." He at once tore it
open and eagerly read:</p>

<blockquote>"MY DEAR NEPHEW:<br>
<br>
"Since your arrival my husband has been away most of the time, and
although we have wished to have you with us before, we have thought
it best to await his leisure. He is freer now and we will be very
glad if you can find it convenient to come to supper with us at six
o'clock next Sunday. We dine very informally&mdash;just
ourselves&mdash;so in case you can or cannot come, you need not
bother to write or telephone. And you need not dress for this
occasion either. But come if you can. We will be happy to see
you.<br>
<br>
"Sincerely, your aunt,<br>
<br>
"ELIZABETH GRIFFITHS"</blockquote>

<p>On reading this Clyde, who, during all this silence and the
prosecution of a task in the shrinking room which was so eminently
distasteful to him, was being more and more weighed upon by the
thought that possibly, after all, this quest of his was going to
prove a vain one and that he was going to be excluded from any real
contact with his great relatives, was most romantically and hence
impractically heartened. For only see&mdash;here was this grandiose
letter with its "very happy to see you," which seemed to indicate
that perhaps, after all, they did not think so badly of him. Mr.
Samuel Griffiths had been away all the time. That was it. Now he
would get to see his aunt and cousins and the inside of that great
house. It must be very wonderful. They might even take him up after
this&mdash;who could tell? But how remarkable that he should be
taken up now, just when he had about decided that they would
not.</p>

<p>And forthwith his interest in, as well as his weakness for,
Rita, if not Zella and Dillard began to evaporate. What! Mix with
people so far below him&mdash;a Griffiths&mdash;in the social scale
here and at the cost of endangering his connection with that
important family. Never! It was a great mistake. Didn't this letter
coming just at this time prove it? And fortunately&mdash;(how
fortunately!)&mdash; he had had the good sense not to let himself
in for anything as yet. And so now, without much trouble, and
because, most likely from now on it would prove necessary for him
so to do he could gradually eliminate himself from this contact
with Dillard&mdash;move away from Mrs. Cuppy's&mdash;if necessary,
or say that his uncle had cautioned him&mdash;anything, but not go
with this crowd any more, just the same. It wouldn't do. It would
endanger his prospects in connection with this new development. And
instead of troubling over Rita and Utica now, he began to formulate
for himself once more the essential nature of the private life of
the Griffiths, the fascinating places they must go, the interesting
people with whom they must be in contact. And at once he began to
think of the need of a dress suit, or at least a tuxedo and
trousers. Accordingly the next morning, he gained permission from
Mr. Kemerer to leave at eleven and not return before one, and in
that time he managed to find coat, trousers and a pair of patent
leather shoes, as well as a white silk muffler for the money he had
already saved. And so arrayed he felt himself safe. He must make a
good impression.</p>

<p>And for the entire time between then and Sunday evening, instead
of thinking of Rita or Dillard or Zella any more, he was thinking
of this opportunity. Plainly it was an event to be admitted to the
presence of such magnificence.</p>

<p>The only drawback to all this, as he well sensed now, was this
same Gilbert Griffiths, who surveyed him always whenever he met him
anywhere with such hard, cold eyes. He might be there, and then he
would probably assume that superior attitude, to make him feel his
inferior position, if he could&mdash;and Clyde had the weakness at
times of admitting to himself that he could. And no doubt, if he
(Clyde) sought to carry himself with too much of an air in the
presence of this family, Gilbert most likely would seek to take it
out of him in some way later in connection with the work in the
factory. He might see to it, for instance, that his father heard
only unfavorable things about him. And, of course, if he were
retained in this wretched shrinking room, and given no show of any
kind, how could he expect to get anywhere or be anybody? It was
just his luck that on arriving here he should find this same
Gilbert looking almost like him and being so opposed to him for
obviously no reason at all.</p>

<p>However, despite all his doubts, he decided to make the best of
this opportunity, and accordingly on Sunday evening at six set out
for the Griffiths' residence, his nerves decidedly taut because of
the ordeal before him. And when he reached the main gate, a large,
arched wrought iron affair which gave in on a wide, winding brick
walk which led to the front entrance, he lifted the heavy latch
which held the large iron gates in place, with almost a quaking
sense of adventure. And as he approached along the walk, he felt as
though he might well be the object of observant and critical eyes.
Perhaps Mr. Samuel or Mr. Gilbert Griffiths or one or the other of
the two sisters was looking at him now from one of those heavily
curtained windows. On the lower floor several lights glowed with a
soft and inviting radiance.</p>

<p>This mood, however, was brief. For soon the door was opened by a
servant who took his coat and invited him into the very large
living room, which was very impressive. To Clyde, even after the
Green-Davidson and the Union League, it seemed a very beautiful
room. It contained so many handsome pieces of furniture and such
rich rugs and hangings. A fire burned in the large, high fireplace
before which was circled a number of divans and chairs. There were
lamps, a tall clock, a great table. No one was in the room at the
moment, but presently as Clyde fidgeted and looked about he heard a
rustling of silk to the rear, where a great staircase descended
from the rooms above. And from there he saw Mrs. Griffiths
approaching him, a bland and angular and faded-looking woman. But
her walk was brisk, her manner courteous, if non-committal, as was
her custom always, and after a few moments of conversation he found
himself peaceful and fairly comfortable in her presence.</p>

<p>"My nephew, I believe," she smiled.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Clyde simply, and because of his nervousness,
with unusual dignity. "I am Clyde Griffiths."</p>

<p>"I'm very glad to see you and to welcome you to our home," began
Mrs. Griffiths with a certain amount of aplomb which years of
contact with the local high world had given her at last. "And my
children will be, too, of course. Bella is not here just now or
Gilbert, either, but then they will be soon, I believe. My husband
is resting, but I heard him stirring just now, and he'll be down in
a moment. Won't you sit here?" She motioned to a large divan
between them. "We dine nearly always alone here together on Sunday
evening, so I thought it would be nice if you came just to be alone
with us. How do you like Lycurgus now?"</p>

<p>She arranged herself on one of the large divans before the fire
and Clyde rather awkwardly seated himself at a respectful distance
from her.</p>

<p>"Oh, I like it very much," he observed, exerting himself to be
congenial and to smile. "Of course I haven't seen so very much of
it yet, but what I have I like. This street is one of the nicest I
have ever seen anywhere," he added enthusiastically. "The houses
are so large and the grounds so beautiful."</p>

<p>"Yes, we here in Lycurgus pride ourselves on Wykeagy Avenue,"
smiled Mrs. Griffiths, who took no end of satisfaction in the grace
and rank of her own home in this street. She and her husband had
been so long climbing up to it. "Every one who sees it seems to
feel the same way about it. It was laid out many years ago when
Lycurgus was just a village. It is only within the last fifteen
years that it has come to be as handsome as it is now.</p>

<p>"But you must tell me something about your mother and father. I
never met either of them, you know, though, of course, I have heard
my husband speak of them often&mdash;that is, of his brother,
anyhow," she corrected. "I don't believe he ever met your mother.
How is your father?"</p>

<p>"Oh, he's quite well," replied Clyde, simply. "And Mother, too.
They're living in Denver now. We did live for a while in Kansas
City, but for the last three years they've been out there. I had a
letter from Mother only the other day. She says everything is all
right."</p>

<p>"Then you keep up a correspondence with her, do you? That's
nice." She smiled, for by now she had become interested by and, on
the whole, rather taken with Clyde's appearance. He looked so neat
and generally presentable, so much like her own son that she was a
little startled at first and intrigued on that score. If anything,
Clyde was taller, better built and hence better looking, only she
would never have been willing to admit that. For to her Gilbert,
although he was intolerant and contemptuous even to her at times,
simulating an affection which was as much a custom as a reality,
was still a dynamic and aggressive person putting himself and his
conclusions before everyone else. Whereas Clyde was more soft and
vague and fumbling. Her son's force must be due to the innate
ability of her husband as well as the strain of some relatives in
her own line who had not been unlike Gilbert, while Clyde probably
drew his lesser force from the personal unimportance of his
parents.</p>

<p>But having settled this problem in her son's favor, Mrs.
Griffiths was about to ask after his sisters and brothers, when
they were interrupted by Samuel Griffiths who now approached.
Measuring Clyde, who had risen, very sharply once more, and finding
him very satisfactory in appearance at least, he observed: "Well,
so here you are, eh? They've placed you, I believe, without my ever
seeing you."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied Clyde, very deferentially and half bowing in
the presence of so great a man.</p>

<p>"Well, that's all right. Sit down! Sit down! I'm very glad they
did. I hear you're working down in the shrinking room at present.
Not exactly a pleasant place, but not such a bad place to begin,
either&mdash;at the bottom. The best people start there sometimes."
He smiled and added: "I was out of the city when you came on or I
would have seen you."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied Clyde, who had not ventured to seat himself
again until Mr. Griffiths had sunk into a very large stuffed chair
near the divan. And the latter, now that he saw Clyde in an
ordinary tuxedo with a smart pleated shirt and black tie, as
opposed to the club uniform in which he had last seen him in
Chicago, was inclined to think him even more attractive than
before&mdash;not quite as negligible and unimportant as his son
Gilbert had made out. Still, not being dead to the need of force
and energy in business and sensing that Clyde was undoubtedly
lacking in these qualities, he did now wish that Clyde had more
vigor and vim in him. It would reflect more handsomely on the
Griffiths end of the family and please his son more, maybe.</p>

<p>"Like it where you are now?" he observed condescendingly.</p>

<p>"Well, yes, sir, that is, I wouldn't say that I like it
exactly," replied Clyde quite honestly. "But I don't mind it. It's
as good as any other way to begin, I suppose." The thought in his
mind at the moment was that he would like to impress on his uncle
that he was cut out for something better. And the fact that his
cousin Gilbert was not present at the moment gave him the courage
to say it.</p>

<p>"Well, that's the proper spirit," commented Samuel Griffiths,
pleased. "It isn't the most pleasant part of the process, I will
admit, but it's one of the most essential things to know, to begin
with. And it takes a little time, of course, to get anywhere in any
business these days."</p>

<p>From this Clyde wondered how long he was to be left in that dim
world below stairs.</p>

<p>But while he was thinking this Myra came forward, curious about
him and what he would be like, and very pleased to see that he was
not as uninteresting as Gilbert had painted him. There was
something, as she now saw, about Clyde's eyes&mdash;nervous and
somewhat furtive and appealing or seeking&mdash;that at once
interested her, and reminded her, perhaps, since she was not much
of a success socially either, of something in herself.</p>

<p>"Your cousin, Clyde Griffiths, Myra," observed Samuel rather
casually, as Clyde arose. "My daughter Myra," he added, to Clyde.
"This is the young man I've been telling you about."</p>

<p>Clyde bowed and then took the cool and not very vital hand that
Myra extended to him, but feeling it just the same to be more
friendly and considerate than the welcome of the others.</p>

<p>"Well, I hope you'll like it, now that you're here," she began,
genially. "We all like Lycurgus, only after Chicago I suppose it
will not mean so very much to you." She smiled and Clyde, feeling
very formal and stiff in the presence of all these very superior
relatives, now returned a stiff "thank you," and was just about to
seat himself when the outer door opened and Gilbert Griffiths
strode in. The whirring of a motor had preceded this&mdash;a motor
that had stopped outside the large east side entrance. "Just a
minute, Dolge," he called to some one outside. "I won't be long."
Then turning to the family, he added: "Excuse me, folks, I'll be
back in a minute." He dashed up the rear stairs, only to return
after a time and confront Clyde, if not the others, with that same
rather icy and inconsiderate air that had so far troubled him at
the factory. He was wearing a light, belted motoring coat of a very
pronounced stripe, and a dark leather cap and gauntlets which gave
him almost a military air. After nodding to Clyde rather stiffly,
and adding, "How do you do," he laid a patronizing hand on his
father's shoulder and observed: "Hi, Dad. Hello, Mother. Sorry I
can't be with you to-night. But I just came over from Amsterdam
with Dolge and Eustis to get Constance and Jacqueline. There's some
doings over at the Bridgemans'. But I'll be back again before
morning. Or at the office, anyhow. Everything all right with you,
Mr. Griffiths?" he observed to his father.</p>

<p>"Yes, I have nothing to complain of," returned his father. "But
it seems to me you're making a pretty long night of it, aren't
you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't mean that," returned his son, ignoring Clyde
entirely. "I just mean that if I can't get back by two, I'll stay
over, that's all, see." He tapped his father genially on the
shoulder again.</p>

<p>"I hope you're not driving that car as fast as usual,"
complained his mother. "It's not safe at all."</p>

<p>"Fifteen miles an hour, Mother. Fifteen miles an hour. I know
the rules." He smiled loftily.</p>

<p>Clyde did not fail to notice the tone of condescension and
authority that went with all this. Plainly here, as at the factory,
he was a person who had to be reckoned with. Apart from his father,
perhaps, there was no one here to whom he offered any reverence.
What a superior attitude, thought Clyde!</p>

<p>How wonderful it must be to be a son who, without having had to
earn all this, could still be so much, take oneself so seriously,
exercise so much command and authority. It might be, as it plainly
was, that this youth was very superior and indifferent in tone
toward him. But think of being such a youth, having so much power
at one's command!</p>

<h3>Chapter 10</h3>

<p>At this point a maid announced that supper was served and
instantly Gilbert took his departure. At the same time the family
arose and Mrs. Griffiths asked the maid: "Has Bella telephoned
yet?"</p>

<p>"No, ma'am," replied the servant, "not yet."</p>

<p>"Well, have Mrs. Truesdale call up the Finchleys and see if
she's there. You tell her I said that she is to come home at
once."</p>

<p>The maid departed for a moment while the group proceeded to the
dining room, which lay to the west of the stairs at the rear.
Again, as Clyde saw, this was another splendidly furnished room
done in a very light brown, with a long center table of carved
walnut, evidently used only for special occasions. It was
surrounded by high-backed chairs and lighted by candelabras set at
even spaces upon it. In a lower ceilinged and yet ample circular
alcove beyond this, looking out on the garden to the south, was a
smaller table set for six. It was in this alcove that they were to
dine, a different thing from what Clyde had expected for some
reason.</p>

<p>Seated in a very placid fashion, he found himself answering
questions principally as to his own family, the nature of its life,
past and present; how old was his father now? His mother? What had
been the places of their residence before moving to Denver? How
many brothers and sisters had he? How old was his sister, Esta?
What did she do? And the others? Did his father like managing a
hotel? What had been the nature of his father's work in Kansas
City? How long had the family lived there?</p>

<p>Clyde was not a little troubled and embarrassed by this chain of
questions which flowed rather heavily and solemnly from Samuel
Griffiths or his wife. And from Clyde's hesitating replies,
especially in regard to the nature of the family life in Kansas
City, both gathered that he was embarrassed and troubled by some of
the questions. They laid it to the extreme poverty of their
relatives, of course. For having asked, "I suppose you began your
hotel work in Kansas City, didn't you, after you left school?"
Clyde blushed deeply, bethinking himself of the incident of the
stolen car and of how little real schooling he had had. Most
certainly he did not like the thought of having himself identified
with hotel life in Kansas City, and more especially the
Green-Davidson.</p>

<p>But fortunately at this moment, the door opened and Bella
entered, accompanied by two girls such as Clyde would have assumed
at once belonged to this world. How different to Rita and Zella
with whom his thought so recently had been disturbedly concerned.
He did not know Bella, of course, until she proceeded most
familiarly to address her family. But the others&mdash;one was
Sondra Finchley, so frequently referred to by Bella and her
mother&mdash;as smart and vain and sweet a girl as Clyde had ever
laid his eyes upon&mdash;so different to any he had ever known and
so superior. She was dressed in a close-fitting tailored suit which
followed her form exactly and which was enhanced by a small dark
leather hat, pulled fetchingly low over her eyes. A leather belt of
the same color encircled her neck. By a leather leash she led a
French bull and over one arm carried a most striking coat of black
and gray checks&mdash;not too pronounced and yet having the effect
of a man's modish overcoat. To Clyde's eyes she was the most
adorable feminine thing he had seen in all his days. Indeed her
effect on him was electric&mdash; thrilling&mdash;arousing in him a
curiously stinging sense of what it was to want and not to
have&mdash;to wish to win and yet to feel, almost agonizingly that
he was destined not even to win a glance from her. It tortured and
flustered him. At one moment he had a keen desire to close his eyes
and shut her out&mdash;at another to look only at her
constantly&mdash;so truly was he captivated.</p>

<p>Yet, whether she saw him or not, she gave no sign at first,
exclaiming to her dog: "Now, Bissell, if you're not going to
behave, I'm going to take you out and tie you out there. Oh, I
don't believe I can stay a moment if he won't behave better than
this." He had seen a family cat and was tugging to get near
her.</p>

<p>Beside her was another girl whom Clyde did not fancy nearly so
much, and yet who, after her fashion, was as smart as Sondra and
perhaps as alluring to some. She was
blonde&mdash;tow-headed&mdash;with clear almond-shaped,
greenish-gray eyes, a small, graceful, catlike figure, and a slinky
feline manner. At once, on entering, she sidled across the room to
the end of the table where Mrs. Griffiths sat and leaning over her
at once began to purr.</p>

<p>"Oh, how are you, Mrs. Griffiths? I'm so glad to see you again.
It's been some time since I've been over here, hasn't it? But then
Mother and I have been away. She and Grant are over at Albany
to-day. And I just picked up Bella and Sondra here at the
Lamberts'. You're just having a quiet little supper by yourselves,
aren't you? How are you, Myra?" she called, and reaching over Mrs.
Griffiths' shoulder touched Myra quite casually on the arm, as
though it were more a matter of form than anything else.</p>

<p>In the meantime Bella, who next to Sondra seemed to Clyde
decidedly the most charming of the three, was exclaiming: "Oh, I'm
late. Sorry, Mamma and Daddy. Won't that do this time?" Then noting
Clyde, and as though for the first time, although he had risen as
they entered and was still standing, she paused in semi-mock
modesty as did the others. And Clyde, oversensitive to just such
airs and material distinctions, was fairly tremulous with a sense
of his own inadequacy, as he waited to be introduced. For to him,
youth and beauty in such a station as this represented the ultimate
triumph of the female. His weakness for Hortense Briggs, to say
nothing of Rita, who was not so attractive as either of these,
illustrated the effect of trim femininity on him, regardless of
merit.</p>

<p>"Bella," observed Samuel Griffiths, heavily, noting Clyde still
standing, "your cousin, Clyde."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," replied Bella, observing that Clyde looked
exceedingly like Gilbert. "How are you? Mother has been saying that
you were coming to call one of these days." She extended a finger
or two, then turned toward her friends. "My friends, Miss Finchley
and Miss Cranston, Mr. Griffiths."</p>

<p>The two girls bowed, each in the most stiff and formal manner,
at the same time studying Clyde most carefully and rather directly,
"Well, he does look like Gil a lot, doesn't he?" whispered Sondra
to Bertine, who had drawn near to her. And Bertine replied: "I
never saw anything like it. He's really better-looking, isn't
he&mdash; a lot?"</p>

<p>Sondra nodded, pleased to note in the first instance that he was
somewhat better-looking than Bella's brother, whom she did not
like&mdash;next that he was obviously stricken with her, which was
her due, as she invariably decided in connection with youths thus
smitten with her. But having thus decided, and seeing that his
glance was persistently and helplessly drawn to her, she concluded
that she need pay no more attention to him, for the present anyway.
He was too easy.</p>

<p>But now Mrs. Griffiths, who had not anticipated this visitation
and was a little irritated with Bella for introducing her friends
at this time since it at once raised the question of Clyde's social
position here, observed: "Hadn't you two better lay off your coats
and sit down? I'll just have Nadine lay extra plates at this end.
Bella, you can sit next to your father."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, not at all," and "No, indeed, we're just on our way
home ourselves. I can't stay a minute," came from Sondra and
Bertine. But now that they were here and Clyde had proved to be as
attractive as he was, they were perversely interested to see what,
if any, social flair there was to him. Gilbert Griffiths, as both
knew, was far from being popular in some quarters&mdash;their own
in particular, however much they might like Bella. He was, for two
such self-centered beauties as these, too aggressive, self-willed
and contemptuous at times. Whereas Clyde, if one were to judge by
his looks, at least was much more malleable. And if it were to
prove now that he was of equal station, or that the Griffiths
thought so, decidedly he would be available locally, would he not?
At any rate, it would be interesting to know whether he was rich.
But this thought was almost instantly satisfied by Mrs. Griffiths,
who observed rather definitely and intentionally to Bertine: "Mr.
Griffiths is a nephew of ours from the West who has come on to see
if he can make a place for himself in my husband's factory. He's a
young man who has to make his own way in the world and my husband
has been kind enough to give him an opportunity."</p>

<p>Clyde flushed, since obviously this was a notice to him that his
social position here was decidedly below that of the Griffiths or
these girls. At the same time, as he also noticed, the look of
Bertine Cranston, who was only interested in youths of means and
position, changed from one of curiosity to marked indifference. On
the other hand, Sondra Finchley, by no means so practical as her
friend, though of a superior station in her set, since she was so
very attractive and her parents possessed of even more
means&mdash;re-surveyed Clyde with one thought written rather
plainly on her face, that it was too bad. He really was so
attractive.</p>

<p>At the same time Samuel Griffiths, having a peculiar fondness
for Sondra, if not Bertine, whom Mrs. Griffiths also disliked as
being too tricky and sly, was calling to her: "Here, Sondra, tie up
your dog to one of the dining-room chairs and come and sit by me.
Throw your coat over that chair. Here's room for you." He motioned
to her to come.</p>

<p>"But I can't, Uncle Samuel!" called Sondra, familiarly and
showily and yet somehow sweetly, seeking to ingratiate herself by
this affected relationship. "We're late now. Besides Bissell won't
behave. Bertine and I are just on our way home, truly."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, Papa," put in Bella, quickly, "Bertine's horse ran a
nail in his foot yesterday and is going lame to-day. And neither
Grant nor his father is home. She wants to know if you know
anything that's good for it."</p>

<p>"Which foot is it?" inquired Griffiths, interested, while Clyde
continued to survey Sondra as best he might. She was so delicious,
he thought&mdash;her nose so tiny and tilted&mdash;her upper lip
arched so roguishly upward toward her nose.</p>

<p>"It's the left fore. I was riding out on the East Kingston road
yesterday afternoon. Jerry threw a shoe and must have picked up a
splinter, but John doesn't seem to be able to find it."</p>

<p>"Did you ride him much with the nail, do you think?"</p>

<p>"About eight miles&mdash;all the way back."</p>

<p>"Well, you had better have John put on some liniment and a
bandage and call a veterinary. He'll come around all right, I'm
sure."</p>

<p>The group showed no signs of leaving and Clyde, left quite to
himself for the moment, was thinking what an easy, delightful world
this must be&mdash;this local society. For here they were without a
care, apparently, between any of them. All their talk was of houses
being built, horses they were riding, friends they had met, places
they were going to, things they were going to do. And there was
Gilbert, who had left only a little while before&mdash;motoring
somewhere with a group of young men. And Bella, his cousin,
trifling around with these girls in the beautiful homes of this
street, while he was shunted away in a small third-floor room at
Mrs. Cuppy's with no place to go. And with only fifteen dollars a
week to live on. And in the morning he would be working in the
basement again, while these girls were rising to more pleasure. And
out in Denver were his parents with their small lodging house and
mission, which he dared not even describe accurately here.</p>

<p>Suddenly the two girls declaring they must go, they took
themselves off. And he and the Griffiths were once more left to
themselves&mdash; he with the feeling that he was very much out of
place and neglected here, since Samuel Griffiths and his wife and
Bella, anyhow, if not Myra, seemed to be feeling that he was merely
being permitted to look into a world to which he did not belong;
also, that because of his poverty it would be impossible to fit him
into&mdash; however much he might dream of associating with three
such wonderful girls as these. And at once he felt
sad&mdash;very&mdash;his eyes and his mood darkening so much that
not only Samuel Griffiths, but his wife as well as Myra noticed it.
If he could enter upon this world, find some way. But of the group
it was only Myra, not any of the others, who sensed that in all
likelihood he was lonely and depressed. And in consequence as all
were rising and returning to the large living room (Samuel chiding
Bella for her habit of keeping her family waiting) it was Myra who
drew near to Clyde to say: "I think after you've been here a little
while you'll probably like Lycurgus better than you do now, even.
There are quite a number of interesting places to go and see around
here&mdash; lakes and the Adirondacks are just north of here, about
seventy miles. And when the summer comes and we get settled at
Greenwood, I'm sure Father and Mother will like you to come up
there once in a while."</p>

<p>She was by no means sure that this was true, but under the
circumstances, whether it was or not, she felt like saying it to
Clyde. And thereafter, since he felt more comfortable with her, he
talked with her as much as he could without neglecting either Bella
or the family, until about half-past nine, when, suddenly feeling
very much out of place and alone, he arose saying that he must go,
that he had to get up early in the morning. And as he did so,
Samuel Griffiths walked with him to the front door and let him out.
But he, too, by now, as had Myra before him, feeling that Clyde was
rather attractive and yet, for reasons of poverty, likely to be
neglected from now on, not only by his family, but by himself as
well, observed most pleasantly, and, as he hoped, compensatively:
"It's rather nice out, isn't it? Wykeagy Avenue hasn't begun to
show what it can do yet because the spring isn't quite here. But in
a few weeks," and he looked up most inquiringly at the sky and
sniffed the late April air, "we must have you out. All the trees
and flowers will be in bloom then and you can see how really nice
it is. Good night."</p>

<p>He smiled and put a very cordial note into his voice, and once
more Clyde felt that, whatever Gilbert Griffiths' attitude might
be, most certainly his father was not wholly indifferent to
him.</p>

<h3>Chapter 11</h3>

<p>The days lapsed and, although no further word came from the
Griffiths, Clyde was still inclined to exaggerate the importance of
this one contact and to dream from time to time of delightful
meetings with those girls and how wonderful if a love affair with
one of them might eventuate for him. The beauty of that world in
which they moved. The luxury and charm as opposed to this of which
he was a part. Dillard! Rita! Tush! They were really dead for him.
He aspired to this other or nothing as he saw it now and proceeded
to prove as distant to Dillard as possible, an attitude which by
degrees tended to alienate that youth entirely for he saw in Clyde
a snob which potentially he was if he could have but won to what he
desired. However, as he began to see afterwards, time passed and he
was left to work until, depressed by the routine, meager pay and
commonplace shrinking-room contacts, he began to think not so much
of returning to Rita or Dillard,&mdash;he could not quite think of
them now with any satisfaction, but of giving up this venture here
and returning to Chicago or going to New York, where he was sure
that he could connect himself with some hotel if need be. But then,
as if to revive his courage and confirm his earlier dreams, a thing
happened which caused him to think that certainly he was beginning
to rise in the estimation of the Griffiths&mdash;father and
son&mdash;whether they troubled to entertain him socially or not.
For it chanced that one Saturday in spring, Samuel Griffiths
decided to make a complete tour of inspection of the factory with
Joshua Whiggam at his elbow. Reaching the shrinking department
about noon, he observed for the first time with some dismay, Clyde
in his undershirt and trousers working at the feeding end of two of
the shrinking racks, his nephew having by this time acquired the
necessary skill to "feed" as well as "take." And recalling how very
neat and generally presentable he had appeared at his house but a
few weeks before, he was decidedly disturbed by the contrast. For
one thing he had felt about Clyde, both in Chicago and here at his
home, was that he had presented a neat and pleasing appearance. And
he, almost as much as his son, was jealous, not only of the name,
but the general social appearance of the Griffiths before the
employees of this factory as well as the community at large. And
the sight of Clyde here, looking so much like Gilbert and in an
armless shirt and trousers working among these men, tended to
impress upon him more sharply than at any time before the fact that
Clyde was his nephew, and that he ought not to be compelled to
continue at this very menial form of work any longer. To the other
employees it might appear that he was unduly indifferent to the
meaning of such a relationship.</p>

<p>Without, however, saying a word to Whiggam or anyone else at the
time, he waited until his son returned on Monday morning, from a
trip that he had taken out of town, when he called him into his
office and observed: "I made a tour of the factory Saturday and
found young Clyde still down in the shrinking room."</p>

<p>"What of it, Dad?" replied his son, curiously interested as to
why his father should at this time wish to mention Clyde in this
special way. "Other people before him have worked down there and it
hasn't hurt them."</p>

<p>"All true enough, but they weren't nephews of mine. And they
didn't look as much like you as he does"&mdash;a comment which
irritated Gilbert greatly. "It won't do, I tell you. It doesn't
look quite right to me, and I'm afraid it won't look right to other
people here who see how much he looks like you and know that he is
your cousin and my nephew. I didn't realize that at first, because
I haven't been down there, but I don't think it wise to keep him
down there any longer doing that kind of thing. It won't do. We'll
have to make a change, switch him around somewhere else where he
won't look like that."</p>

<p>His eyes darkened and his brow wrinkled. The impression that
Clyde made in his old clothes and with beads of sweat standing out
on his forehead had not been pleasant.</p>

<p>"But I'll tell you how it is, Dad," Gilbert persisted, anxious
and determined because of his innate opposition to Clyde to keep
him there if possible. "I'm not so sure that I can find just the
right place for him now anywhere else&mdash;at least not without
moving someone else who has been here a long time and worked hard
to get there. He hasn't had any training in anything so far, but
just what he's doing."</p>

<p>"Don't know or don't care anything about that," replied
Griffiths senior, feeling that his son was a little jealous and in
consequence disposed to be unfair to Clyde. "That's no place for
him and I won't have him there any longer. He's been there long
enough. And I can't afford to have the name of any of this family
come to mean anything but just what it does around here now&mdash;
reserve and ability and energy and good judgment. It's not good for
the business. And anything less than that is a liability. You get
me, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I get you all right, governor."</p>

<p>"Well, then, do as I say. Get hold of Whiggam and figure out
some other place for him around here, and not as piece worker or a
hand either. It was a mistake to put him down there in the first
place. There must be some little place in one of the departments
where he can be fitted in as the head of something, first or second
or third assistant to some one, and where he can wear a decent suit
of clothes and look like somebody. And, if necessary, let him go
home on full pay until you find something for him. But I want him
changed. By the way, how much is he being paid now?"</p>

<p>"About fifteen, I think," replied Gilbert blandly.</p>

<p>"Not enough, if he's to make the right sort of an appearance
here. Better make it twenty-five. It's more than he's worth, I
know, but it can't be helped now. He has to have enough to live on
while he's here, and from now on, I'd rather pay him that than have
any one think we were not treating him right."</p>

<p>"All right, all right, governor. Please don't be cross about it,
will you?" pleaded Gilbert, noting his father's irritation. "I'm
not entirely to blame. You agreed to it in the first place when I
suggested it, didn't you? But I guess you're right at that. Just
leave it to me. I'll find a decent place for him," and turning, he
proceeded in search of Whiggam, although at the same time thinking
how he was to effect all this without permitting Clyde to get the
notion that he was at all important here&mdash;to make him feel
that this was being done as a favor to him and not for any reasons
of merit in connection with himself.</p>

<p>And at once, Whiggam appearing, he, after a very diplomatic
approach on the part of Gilbert, racked his brains, scratched his
head, went away and returned after a time to say that the only
thing he could think of, since Clyde was obviously lacking in
technical training, was that of assistant to Mr. Liggett, who was
foreman in charge of five big stitching rooms on the fifth floor,
but who had under him one small and very special, though by no
means technical, department which required the separate supervision
of either an assistant forelady or man.</p>

<p>This was the stamping room&mdash;a separate chamber at the west
end of the stitching floor, where were received daily from the
cutting room above from seventy-five to one hundred thousand dozen
unstitched collars of different brands and sizes. And here they
were stamped by a group of girls according to the slips or
directions attached to them with the size and brand of the collar.
The sole business of the assistant foreman in charge here, as
Gilbert well knew, after maintaining due decorum and order, was to
see that this stamping process went uninterruptedly forward. Also
that after the seventy-five to one hundred thousand dozen collars
were duly stamped and transmitted to the stitchers, who were just
outside in the larger room, to see that they were duly credited in
a book of entry. And that the number of dozens stamped by each girl
was duly recorded in order that her pay should correspond with her
services.</p>

<p>For this purpose a little desk and various entry books,
according to size and brand, were kept here. Also the cutters'
slips, as taken from the bundles by the stampers were eventually
delivered to this assistant in lots of a dozen or more and filed on
spindles. It was really nothing more than a small clerkship, at
times in the past held by young men or girls or old men or
middle-aged women, according to the exigencies of the life of the
place.</p>

<p>The thing that Whiggam feared in connection with Clyde and which
he was quick to point out to Gilbert on this occasion was that
because of his inexperience and youth Clyde might not, at first,
prove as urgent and insistent a master of this department as the
work there required. There were nothing but young girls
there&mdash;some of them quite attractive. Also was it wise to
place a young man of Clyde's years and looks among so many girls?
For, being susceptible, as he might well be at that age, he might
prove too easy&mdash;not stern enough. The girls might take
advantage of him. If so, it wouldn't be possible to keep him there
very long. Still there was this temporary vacancy, and it was the
only one in the whole factory at the moment. Why not, for the time
being, send him upstairs for a tryout? It might not be long before
either Mr. Liggett or himself would know of something else or
whether or not he was suited for the work up there. In that case it
would be easy to make a re-transfer.</p>

<p>Accordingly, about three in the afternoon of this same Monday,
Clyde was sent for and after being made to wait for some fifteen
minutes, as was Gilbert's method, he was admitted to the austere
presence.</p>

<p>"Well, how are you getting along down where you are now?" asked
Gilbert coldly and inquisitorially. And Clyde, who invariably
experienced a depression whenever he came anywhere near his cousin,
replied, with a poorly forced smile, "Oh, just about the same, Mr.
Griffiths. I can't complain. I like it well enough. I'm learning a
little something, I guess."</p>

<p>"You guess?"</p>

<p>"Well, I know I've learned a few things, of course," added
Clyde, flushing slightly and feeling down deep within himself a
keen resentment at the same time that he achieved a
half-ingratiating and half-apologetic smile.</p>

<p>"Well, that's a little better. A man could hardly be down there
as long as you've been and not know whether he had learned anything
or not." Then deciding that he was being too severe, perhaps, he
modified his tone slightly, and added: "But that's not why I sent
for you. There's another matter I want to talk to you about. Tell
me, did you ever have charge of any people or any other person than
yourself, at any time in your life?"</p>

<p>"I don't believe I quite understand," replied Clyde, who,
because he was a little nervous and flustered, had not quite
registered the question accurately.</p>

<p>"I mean have you ever had any people work under you&mdash;been
given a few people to direct in some department somewhere? Been a
foreman or an assistant foreman in charge of anything?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, I never have," answered Clyde, but so nervous that he
almost stuttered. For Gilbert's tone was very severe and
cold&mdash; highly contemptuous. At the same time, now that the
nature of the question was plain, its implication came to him. In
spite of his cousin's severity, his ill manner toward him, still he
could see his employers were thinking of making a foreman of
him&mdash;putting him in charge of somebody&mdash;people. They must
be! At once his ears and fingers began to titillate&mdash;the roots
of his hair to tingle: "But I've seen how it's done in clubs and
hotels," he added at once. "And I think I might manage if I were
given a trial." His cheeks were now highly colored&mdash;his eyes
crystal clear.</p>

<p>"Not the same thing. Not the same thing," insisted Gilbert
sharply. "Seeing and doing are two entirely different things. A
person without any experience can think a lot, but when it comes to
doing, he's not there. Anyhow, this is one business that requires
people who do know."</p>

<p>He stared at Clyde critically and quizzically while Clyde,
feeling that he must be wrong in his notion that something was
going to be done for him, began to quiet himself. His cheeks
resumed their normal pallor and the light died from his eyes.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I guess that's true, too," he commented.</p>

<p>"But you don't need to guess in this case," insisted Gilbert.
"You know. That's the trouble with people who don't know. They're
always guessing."</p>

<p>The truth was that Gilbert was so irritated to think that he
must now make a place for his cousin, and that despite his having
done nothing at all to deserve it, that he could scarcely conceal
the spleen that now colored his mood.</p>

<p>"You're right, I know," said Clyde placatingly, for he was still
hoping for this hinted-at promotion.</p>

<p>"Well, the fact is," went on Gilbert, "I might have placed you
in the accounting end of the business when you first came if you
had been technically equipped for it." (The phrase "technically
equipped" overawed and terrorized Clyde, for he scarcely understood
what that meant.) "As it was," went on Gilbert, nonchalantly, "we
had to do the best we could for you. We knew it was not very
pleasant down there, but we couldn't do anything more for you at
the time." He drummed on his desk with his fingers. "But the reason
I called you up here to-day is this. I want to discuss with you a
temporary vacancy that has occurred in one of our departments
upstairs and which we are wondering&mdash;my father and
I&mdash;whether you might be able to fill." Clyde's spirits rose
amazingly. "Both my father and I," he went on, "have been thinking
for some little time that we would like to do a little something
for you, but as I say, your lack of practical training of any kind
makes it very difficult for both of us. You haven't had either a
commercial or a trade education of any kind, and that makes it
doubly hard." He paused long enough to allow that to sink
in&mdash;give Clyde the feeling that he was an interloper indeed.
"Still," he added after a moment, "so long as we have seen fit to
bring you on here, we have decided to give you a tryout at
something better than you are doing. It won't do to let you stay
down there indefinitely. Now, let me tell you a little something
about what I have in mind," and he proceeded to explain the nature
of the work on the fifth floor.</p>

<p>And when after a time Whiggam was sent for and appeared and had
acknowledged Clyde's salutation, he observed: "Whiggam, I've just
been telling my cousin here about our conversation this morning and
what I told you about our plan to try him out as the head of that
department. So if you'll just take him up to Mr. Liggett and have
him or some one explain the nature of the work up there, I'll be
obliged to you." He turned to his desk. "After that you can send
him back to me," he added. "I want to talk to him again."</p>

<p>Then he arose and dismissed them both with an air, and Whiggam,
still somewhat dubious as to the experiment, but now very anxious
to be pleasant to Clyde since he could not tell what he might
become, led the way to Mr. Liggett's floor. And there, amid a
thunderous hum of machines, Clyde was led to the extreme west of
the building and into a much smaller department which was merely
railed off from the greater chamber by a low fence. Here were about
twenty-five girls and their assistants with baskets, who apparently
were doing their best to cope with a constant stream of unstitched
collar bundles which fell through several chutes from the floor
above.</p>

<p>And now at once, after being introduced to Mr. Liggett, he was
escorted to a small railed-off desk at which sat a short, plump
girl of about his own years, not so very attractive, who arose as
they approached. "This is Miss Todd," began Whiggain. "She's been
in charge for about ten days now in the absence of Mrs. Angier. And
what I want you to do now, Miss Todd, is to explain to Mr.
Griffiths here just as quickly and clearly as you can what it is
you do here. And then later in the day when he comes up here, I
want you to help him to keep track of things until he sees just
what is wanted and can do it himself. You'll do that, won't
you?"</p>

<p>"Why, certainly, Mr. Whiggam. I'll be only too glad to,"
complied Miss Todd, and at once she began to take down the books of
records and to show Clyde how the entry and discharge records were
kept&mdash; also later how the stamping was done&mdash;how the
basket girls took the descending bundles from the chutes and
distributed them evenly according to the needs of the stamper and
how later, as fast as they were stamped, other basket girls carried
them to the stitchers outside. And Clyde, very much interested,
felt that he could do it, only among so many women on a floor like
this he felt very strange. There were so very, very many
women&mdash;hundreds of them&mdash; stretching far and away between
white walls and white columns to the eastern end of the building.
And tall windows that reached from floor to ceiling let in a
veritable flood of light. These girls were not all pretty. He saw
them out of the tail of his eye as first Miss Todd and later
Whiggam, and even Liggett, volunteered to impress points on
him.</p>

<p>"The important thing," explained Whiggam after a time, "is to
see that there is no mistake as to the number of thousands of
dozens of collars that come down here and are stamped, and also
that there's no delay in stamping them and getting them out to the
stitchers. Also that the records of these girls' work is kept
accurately so that there won't be any mistakes as to their
time."</p>

<p>At last Clyde saw what was required of him and the conditions
under which he was about to work and said so. He was very nervous
but quickly decided that if this girl could do the work, he could.
And because Liggett and Whiggam, interested by his relationship to
Gilbert, appeared very friendly and persisted in delaying here,
saying that there was nothing he could not manage they were sure,
he returned after a time with Whiggam to Gilbert who, on seeing him
enter, at once observed: "Well, what's the answer? Yes or no. Do
you think you can do it or do you think you can't?"</p>

<p>"Well, I know that I can do it," replied Clyde with a great deal
of courage for him, yet with the private feeling that he might not
make good unless fortune favored him some even now. There were so
many things to be taken into consideration&mdash;the favor of those
above as well as about him&mdash;and would they always favor
him?</p>

<p>"Very good, then. Just be seated for a moment," went on Gilbert.
"I want to talk to you some more in connection with that work up
there. It looks easy to you, does it?"</p>

<p>"No, I can't say that it looks exactly easy," replied Clyde,
strained and a little pale, for because of his inexperience he felt
the thing to be a great opportunity&mdash;one that would require
all his skill and courage to maintain. "Just the same I think I can
do it. In fact I know I can and I'd like to try."</p>

<p>"Well, now, that sounds a little better," replied Gilbert
crisply and more graciously. "And now I want to tell you something
more about it. I don't suppose you ever thought there was a floor
with that many women on it, did you?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, I didn't," replied Clyde. "I knew they were somewhere
in the building, but I didn't know just where."</p>

<p>"Exactly," went on Gilbert. "This plant is practically operated
by women from cellar to roof. In the manufacturing department, I
venture to say there are ten women to every man. On that account
every one in whom we entrust any responsibility around here must be
known to us as to their moral and religious character. If you
weren't related to us, and if we didn't feel that because of that
we knew a little something about you, we wouldn't think of putting
you up there or anywhere in this factory over anybody until we did
know. But don't think because you're related to us that we won't
hold you strictly to account for everything that goes on up there
and for your conduct. We will, and all the more so because you are
related to us. You understand that, do you? And why&mdash;the
meaning of the Griffiths name here?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied Clyde.</p>

<p>"Very well, then," went on Gilbert. "Before we place any one
here in any position of authority, we have to be absolutely sure
that they're going to behave themselves as gentlemen
always&mdash;that the women who are working here are going to
receive civil treatment always. If a young man, or an old one for
that matter, comes in here at any time and imagines that because
there are women here he's going to be allowed to play about and
neglect his work and flirt or cut up, that fellow is doomed to a
short stay here. The men and women who work for us have got to feel
that they are employees first, last and all the time&mdash;and they
have to carry that attitude out into the street with them. And
unless they do it, and we hear anything about it, that man or woman
is done for so far as we are concerned. We don't want 'em and we
won't have 'em. And once we're through with 'em, we're through with
'em."</p>

<p>He paused and stared at Clyde as much as to say: "Now I hope I
have made myself clear. Also that we will never have any trouble in
so far as you are concerned."</p>

<p>And Clyde replied: "Yes, I understand. I think that's right. In
fact I know that's the way it has to be."</p>

<p>"And ought to be," added Gilbert.</p>

<p>"And ought to be," echoed Clyde.</p>

<p>At the same time he was wondering whether it was really true as
Gilbert said. Had he not heard the mill girls already spoken about
in a slighting way? Yet consciously at the moment he did not
connect himself in thought with any of these girls upstairs. His
present mood was that, because of his abnormal interest in girls,
it would be better if he had nothing to do with them at all, never
spoke to any of them, kept a very distant and cold attitude, such
as Gilbert was holding toward him. It must be so, at least if he
wished to keep his place here. And he was now determined to keep it
and to conduct himself always as his cousin wished.</p>

<p>"Well, now, then," went on Gilbert as if to supplement Clyde's
thoughts in this respect, "what I want to know of you is, if I
trouble to put you in that department, even temporarily, can I
trust you to keep a level head on your shoulders and go about your
work conscientiously and not have your head turned or disturbed by
the fact that you're working among a lot of women and girls?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I know you can," replied Clyde very much impressed by
his cousin's succinct demand, although, after Rita, a little
dubious.</p>

<p>"If I can't, now is the time to say so," persisted Gilbert. "By
blood you're a member of this family. And to our help here, and
especially in a position of this kind, you represent us. We can't
have anything come up in connection with you at any time around
here that won't be just right. So I want you to be on your guard
and watch your step from now on. Not the least thing must occur in
connection with you that any one can comment on unfavorably. You
understand, do you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied Clyde most solemnly. "I understand that.
I'll conduct myself properly or I'll get out." And he was thinking
seriously at the moment that he could and would. The large number
of girls and women upstairs seemed very remote and of no
consequence just then.</p>

<p>"Very good. Now, I'll tell you what else I want you to do. I
want you to knock off for the day and go home and sleep on this and
think it over well. Then come back in the morning and go to work up
there, if you still feel the same. Your salary from now on will be
twenty-five dollars, and I want you to dress neat and clean so that
you will be an example to the other men who have charge of
departments."</p>

<p>He arose coldly and distantly, but Clyde, very much encouraged
and enthused by the sudden jump in salary, as well as the
admonition in regard to dressing well, felt so grateful toward his
cousin that he longed to be friendly with him. To be sure, he was
hard and cold and vain, but still he must think something of him,
and his uncle too, or they would not choose to do all this for him
and so speedily. And if ever he were able to make friends with him,
win his way into his good graces, think how prosperously he would
be placed here, what commercial and social honors might not come to
him?</p>

<p>So elated was he at the moment that he bustled out of the great
plant with a jaunty stride, resolved among other things that from
now on, come what might, and as a test of himself in regard to life
and work, he was going to be all that his uncle and cousin
obviously expected of him&mdash;cool, cold even, and if necessary
severe, where these women or girls of this department were
concerned. No more relations with Dillard or Rita or anybody like
that for the present anyhow.</p>

<h3>Chapter 12</h3>

<p>The import of twenty-five dollars a week! Of being the head of a
department employing twenty-five girls! Of wearing a good suit of
clothes again! Sitting at an official desk in a corner commanding a
charming river view and feeling that at last, after almost two
months in that menial department below stairs, he was a figure of
some consequence in this enormous institution! And because of his
relationship and new dignity, Whiggam, as well as Liggett, hovering
about with advice and genial and helpful comments from time to
time. And some of the managers of the other departments including
several from the front office&mdash;an auditor and an advertising
man occasionally pausing in passing to say hello. And the details
of the work sufficiently mastered to permit him to look about him
from time to time, taking an interest in the factory as a whole,
its processes and supplies, such as where the great volume of linen
and cotton came from, how it was cut in an enormous cutting room
above this one, holding hundreds of experienced cutters receiving
very high wages; how there was an employment bureau for recruiting
help, a company doctor, a company hospital, a special dining room
in the main building, where the officials of the company were
allowed to dine&mdash;but no others&mdash;and that he, being an
accredited department head could now lunch with those others in
that special restaurant if he chose and could afford to. Also he
soon learned that several miles out from Lycurgus, on the Mohawk,
near a hamlet called Van Troup, was an inter-factory country club,
to which most of the department heads of the various factories
about belonged, but, alas, as he also learned, Griffiths and
Company did not really favor their officials mixing with those of
any other company, and for that reason few of them did. Yet he,
being a member of the family, as Liggett once said to him, could
probably do as he chose as to that. But he decided, because of the
strong warnings of Gilbert, as well as his high blood relations
with his family, that he had better remain as aloof as possible.
And so smiling and being as genial as possible to all, nevertheless
for the most part, and in order to avoid Dillard and others of his
ilk, and although he was much more lonely than otherwise he would
have been, returning to his room or the public squares of this and
near-by cities on Saturday and Sunday afternoons, and even, since
he thought this might please his uncle and cousin and so raise him
in their esteem, beginning to attend one of the principal
Presbyterian churches&mdash;the Second or High Street Church, to
which on occasion, as he had already learned, the Griffiths
themselves were accustomed to resort. Yet without ever coming in
contact with them in person, since from June to September they
spent their week-ends at Greenwood Lake, to which most of the
society life of this region as yet resorted.</p>

<p>In fact the summer life of Lycurgus, in so far as its society
was concerned, was very dull. Nothing in particular ever eventuated
then in the city, although previous to this, in May, there had been
various affairs in connection with the Griffiths and their friends
which Clyde had either read about or saw at a distance&mdash;a
graduation reception and dance at the Snedeker School, a lawn fete
upon the Griffiths' grounds, with a striped marquee tent on one
part of the lawn and Chinese lanterns hung in among the trees.
Clyde had observed this quite by accident one evening as he was
walking alone about the city. It raised many a curious and eager
thought in regard to this family, its high station and his relation
to it. But having placed him comfortably in a small official
position which was not arduous, the Griffiths now proceeded to
dismiss him from their minds. He was doing well enough, and they
would see something more of him later, perhaps.</p>

<p>And then a little later he read in the Lycurgus Star that there
was to be staged on June twentieth the annual inter-city automobile
floral parade and contest (Fonda, Gloversville, Amsterdam and
Schenectady), which this year was to be held in Lycurgus and which
was the last local social affair of any consequence, as The Star
phrased it, before the annual hegira to the lakes and mountains of
those who were able to depart for such places. And the names of
Bella, Bertine and Sondra, to say nothing of Gilbert, were
mentioned as contestants or defendants of the fair name of
Lycurgus. And since this occurred on a Saturday afternoon, Clyde,
dressed in his best, yet decidedly wishing to obscure himself as an
ordinary spectator, was able to see once more the girl who had so
infatuated him on sight, obviously breasting a white rose-surfaced
stream and guiding her craft with a paddle covered with yellow
daffodils&mdash;a floral representation of some Indian legend in
connection with the Mohawk River. With her dark hair filleted
Indian fashion with a yellow feather and brown-eyed susans, she was
arresting enough not only to capture a prize, but to recapture
Clyde's fancy. How marvelous to be of that world.</p>

<p>In the same parade he had seen Gilbert Griffiths accompanied by
a very attractive girl chauffeuring one of four floats representing
the four seasons. And while the one he drove was winter, with this
local society girl posed in ermine with white roses for snow all
about, directly behind came another float, which presented Bella
Griffiths as spring, swathed in filmy draperies and crouching
beside a waterfall of dark violets. The effect was quite striking
and threw Clyde into a mood in regard to love, youth and romance
which was delicious and yet very painful to him. Perhaps he should
have retained Rita, after all.</p>

<p>In the meantime he was living on as before, only more spaciously
in so far as his own thoughts were concerned. For his first thought
after receiving this larger allowance was that he had better leave
Mrs. Cuppy's and secure a better room in some private home which,
if less advantageously situated for him, would be in a better
street. It took him out of all contact with Dillard. And now, since
his uncle had promoted him, some representative of his or Gilbert's
might wish to stop by to see him about something. And what would
one such think if he found him living in a small room such as he
now occupied?</p>

<p>Ten days after his salary was raised, therefore, and because of
the import of his name, he found it possible to obtain a room in
one of the better houses and streets&mdash;Jefferson Avenue, which
paralleled Wykeagy Avenue, only a few blocks farther out. It was
the home of a widow whose husband had been a mill manager and who
let out two rooms without board in order to be able to maintain
this home, which was above the average for one of such position in
Lycurgus. And Mrs. Peyton, having long been a resident of the city
and knowing much about the Griffiths, recognized not only the name
but the resemblance of Clyde to Gilbert. And being intensely
interested by this, as well as his general appearance, she at once
offered him an exceptional room for so little as five dollars a
week, which he took at once.</p>

<p>In connection with his work at the factory, however, and in
spite of the fact that he had made such drastic resolutions in
regard to the help who were beneath him, still it was not always
possible for him to keep his mind on the mere mechanical routine of
the work or off of this company of girls as girls, since at least a
few of them were attractive. For it was summer&mdash;late June. And
over all the factory, especially around two, three and four in the
afternoon, when the endless repetition of the work seemed to pall
on all, a practical indifference not remote from languor and in
some instances sensuality, seemed to creep over the place. There
were so many women and girls of so many different types and moods.
And here they were so remote from men or idle pleasure in any form,
all alone with just him, really. Again the air within the place was
nearly always heavy and physically relaxing, and through the many
open windows that reached from floor to ceiling could be seen the
Mohawk swirling and rippling, its banks carpeted with green grass
and in places shaded by trees. Always it seemed to hint of
pleasures which might be found by idling along its shores. And
since these workers were employed so mechanically as to leave their
minds free to roam from one thought of pleasure to another, they
were for the most part thinking of themselves always and what they
would do, assuming that they were not here chained to this
routine.</p>

<p>And because their moods were so brisk and passionate, they were
often prone to fix on the nearest object. And since Clyde was
almost always the only male present&mdash;and in these days in his
best clothes&mdash;they were inclined to fix on him. They were,
indeed, full of all sorts of fantastic notions in regard to his
private relations with the Griffiths and their like, where he lived
and how, whom in the way of a girl he might be interested in. And
he, in turn, when not too constrained by the memory of what Gilbert
Griffiths had said to him, was inclined to think of
them&mdash;certain girls in particular&mdash;with thoughts that
bordered on the sensual. For, in spite of the wishes of the
Griffiths Company, and the discarded Rita or perhaps because of
her, he found himself becoming interested in three different girls
here. They were of a pagan and pleasure-loving turn&mdash;this
trio&mdash;and they thought Clyde very handsome. Ruza
Nikoforitch&mdash;a Russian-American girl&mdash;big and blonde and
animal, with swimming brown eyes, a snub fat nose and chin, was
very much drawn to him. Only, such was the manner with which he
carried himself always, that she scarcely dared to let herself
think so. For to her, with his hair so smoothly parted, torsoed in
a bright-striped shirt, the sleeves of which in this weather were
rolled to the elbows, he seemed almost too perfect to be real. She
admired his clean, brown polished shoes, his brightly buckled black
leather belt, and the loose four-in-hand tie he wore.</p>

<p>Again there was Martha Bordaloue, a stocky, brisk
Canadian-French girl of trim, if rotund, figure and ankles, hair of
a reddish gold and eyes of greenish blue with puffy pink cheeks and
hands that were plump and yet small. Ignorant and pagan, she saw in
Clyde some one whom, even for so much as an hour, assuming that he
would, she would welcome&mdash;and that most eagerly. At the same
time, being feline and savage, she hated all or any who even so
much as presumed to attempt to interest him, and despised Ruza for
that reason. For as she could see Ruza tried to nudge or lean
against Clyde whenever he came sufficiently near. At the same time
she herself sought by every single device known to her&mdash;her
shirtwaist left open to below the borders of her white breast, her
outer skirt lifted trimly above her calves when working, her plump
round arms displayed to the shoulders to show him that physically
at least she was worth his time. And the sly sighs and languorous
looks when he was near, which caused Ruza to exclaim one day: "That
French cat! He should look at her!" And because of Clyde she had an
intense desire to strike her.</p>

<p>And yet again there was the stocky and yet gay Flora Brandt, a
decidedly low class American type of coarse and yet enticing
features, black hair, large, swimming and heavily-lashed black
eyes, a snub nose and full and sensuous and yet pretty lips, and a
vigorous and not ungraceful body, who, from day to day, once he had
been there a little while, had continued to look at him as if to
say&mdash;"What! You don't think I'm attractive?" and with a look
which said: "How can you continue to ignore me? There are lots of
fellows who would be delighted to have your chance, I can tell
you."</p>

<p>And, in connection with these three, the thought came to him
after a time that since they were so different, more common as he
thought, less well-guarded and less sharply interested in the
conventional aspects of their contacts, it might be possible and
that without detection on the part of any one for him to play with
one or another of them&mdash;or all three in turn if his interest
should eventually carry him so far&mdash;without being found out,
particularly if beforehand he chose to impress on them the fact
that he was condescending when he noticed them at all. Most
certainly, if he could judge by their actions, they would willingly
reward him by letting him have his way with them somewhere, and
think nothing of it afterward if he chose to ignore them, as he
must to keep his position here. Nevertheless, having given his word
as he had to Gilbert Griffiths, he was still in no mood to break
it. These were merely thoughts which from time to time were aroused
in him by a situation which for him was difficult in the extreme.
His was a disposition easily and often intensely inflamed by the
chemistry of sex and the formula of beauty. He could not easily
withstand the appeal, let alone the call, of sex. And by the
actions and approaches of each in turn he was surely tempted at
times, especially in these warm and languorous summer days, with no
place to go and no single intimate to commune with. From time to
time he could not resist drawing near to these very girls who were
most bent on tempting him, although in the face of their looks and
nudges, not very successfully concealed at times, he maintained an
aloofness and an assumed indifference which was quite remarkable
for him.</p>

<p>But just about this time there was a rush of orders, which
necessitated, as both Whiggam and Liggett advised, Clyde taking on
a few extra "try-out" girls who were willing to work for the very
little they could earn at the current piece work rate until they
had mastered the technique, when of course they would be able to
earn more. There were many such who applied at the employment
branch of the main office on the ground floor. In slack times all
applications were rejected or the sign hung up "No Help
Wanted."</p>

<p>And since Clyde was relatively new to this work, and thus far
had neither hired nor discharged any one, it was agreed between
Whiggam and Liggett that all the help thus sent up should first be
examined by Liggett, who was looking for extra stitchers also. And
in case any were found who promised to be satisfactory as stampers,
they were to be turned over to Clyde with the suggestion that he
try them. Only before bringing any one back to Clyde, Liggett was
very careful to explain that in connection with this temporary
hiring and discharging there was a system. One must not ever give a
new employee, however well they did, the feeling that they were
doing anything but moderately well until their capacity had been
thoroughly tested. It interfered with their proper development as
piece workers, the greatest results that could be obtained by any
one person. Also one might freely take on as many girls as were
needed to meet any such situation, and then, once the rush was
over, as freely drop them&mdash;unless, occasionally, a very speedy
worker was found among the novices. In that case it was always
advisable to try to retain such a person, either by displacing a
less satisfactory person or transferring some one from some other
department, to make room for new blood and new energy.</p>

<p>The next day, after this notice of a rush, back came four girls
at different times and escorted always by Liggett, who in each
instance explained to Clyde: "Here's a girl who might do for you.
Miss Tyndal is her name. You might give her a try-out." Or, "You
might see if this girl will be of any use to you." And Clyde, after
he had questioned them as to where they had worked, what the nature
of the general working experiences were, and whether they lived at
home here in Lycurgus or alone (the bachelor girl was not much
wanted by the factory) would explain the nature of the work and
pay, and then call Miss Todd, who in her turn would first take them
to the rest room where were lockers for their coats, and then to
one of the tables where they would be shown what the process was.
And later it was Miss Todd's and Clyde's business to discover how
well they were getting on and whether it was worth while to retain
them or not.</p>

<p>Up to this time, apart from the girls to whom he was so
definitely drawn, Clyde was not so very favorably impressed with
the type of girl who was working here. For the most part, as he saw
them, they were of a heavy and rather unintelligent company, and he
had been thinking that smarter-looking girls might possibly be
secured. Why not? Were there none in Lycurgus in the factory world?
So many of these had fat hands, broad faces, heavy legs and ankles.
Some of them even spoke with an accent, being Poles or the children
of Poles, living in that slum north of the mill. And they were all
concerned with catching a "feller," going to some dancing place
with him afterwards, and little more. Also, Clyde had noticed that
the American types who were here were of a decidedly different
texture, thinner, more nervous and for the most part more angular,
and with a general reserve due to prejudices, racial, moral and
religious, which would not permit them to mingle with these others
or with any men, apparently.</p>

<p>But among the extras or try-outs that were brought to him during
this and several succeeding days, finally came one who interested
Clyde more than any girl whom he had seen here so far. She was, as
he decided on sight, more intelligent and pleasing&mdash;more
spiritual&mdash; though apparently not less vigorous, if more
gracefully proportioned. As a matter of fact, as he saw her at
first, she appeared to him to possess a charm which no one else in
this room had, a certain wistfulness and wonder combined with a
kind of self-reliant courage and determination which marked her at
once as one possessed of will and conviction to a degree.
Nevertheless, as she said, she was inexperienced in this kind of
work, and highly uncertain as to whether she would prove of service
here or anywhere.</p>

<p>Her name was Roberta Alden, and, as she at once explained,
previous to this she had been working in a small hosiery factory in
a town called Trippetts Mills fifty miles north of Lycurgus. She
had on a small brown hat that did not look any too new, and was
pulled low over a face that was small and regular and pretty and
that was haloed by bright, light brown hair. Her eyes were of a
translucent gray blue. Her little suit was commonplace, and her
shoes were not so very new-looking and quite solidly-soled. She
looked practical and serious and yet so bright and clean and
willing and possessed of so much hope and vigor that along with
Liggett, who had first talked with her, he was at once taken with
her. Distinctly she was above the average of the girls in this
room. And he could not help wondering about her as he talked to
her, for she seemed so tense, a little troubled as to the outcome
of this interview, as though this was a very great adventure for
her.</p>

<p>She explained that up to this time she had been living with her
parents near a town called Biltz, but was now living with friends
here. She talked so honestly and simply that Clyde was very much
moved by her, and for this reason wished to help her. At the same
time he wondered if she were not really above the type of work she
was seeking. Her eyes were so round and blue and
intelligent&mdash;her lips and nose and ears and hands so small and
pleasing.</p>

<p>"You're going to live in Lycurgus, then, if you can get work
here?" he said, more to be talking to her than anything else.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, looking at him most directly and frankly.</p>

<p>"And the name again?" He took down a record pad.</p>

<p>"Roberta Alden."</p>

<p>"And your address here?"</p>

<p>"228 Taylor Street."</p>

<p>"I don't even know where that is myself," he informed her
because he liked talking to her. "I haven't been here so very long,
you see." He wondered just why afterwards he had chosen to tell her
as much about himself so swiftly. Then he added: "I don't know
whether Mr. Liggett has told you all about the work here. But it's
piece work, you know, stamping collars. I'll show you if you'll
just step over here," and he led the way to a near-by table where
the stampers were. After letting her observe how it was done, and
without calling Miss Todd, he picked up one of the collars and
proceeded to explain all that had been previously explained to
him.</p>

<p>At the same time, because of the intentness with which she
observed him and his gestures, the seriousness with which she
appeared to take all that he said, he felt a little nervous and
embarrassed. There was something quite searching and penetrating
about her glance. After he had explained once more what the bundle
rate was, and how much some made and how little others, and she had
agreed that she would like to try, he called Miss Todd, who took
her to the locker room to hang up her hat and coat. Then presently
he saw her returning, a fluff of light hair about her forehead, her
cheeks slightly flushed, her eyes very intent and serious. And as
advised by Miss Todd, he saw her turn back her sleeves, revealing a
pretty pair of forearms. Then she fell to, and by her gestures
Clyde guessed that she would prove both speedy and accurate. For
she seemed most anxious to obtain and keep this place.</p>

<p>After she had worked a little while, he went to her side and
watched her as she picked up and stamped the collars piled beside
her and threw them to one side. Also the speed and accuracy with
which she did it. Then, because for a second she turned and looked
at him, giving him an innocent and yet cheerful and courageous
smile, he smiled back, most pleased.</p>

<p>"Well, I guess you'll make out all right," he ventured to say,
since he could not help feeling that she would. And instantly, for
a second only, she turned and smiled again. And Clyde, in spite of
himself, was quite thrilled. He liked her on the instant, but
because of his own station here, of course, as he now decided, as
well as his promise to Gilbert, he must be careful about being
congenial with any of the help in this room&mdash;even as charming
a girl as this. It would not do. He had been guarding himself in
connection with the others and must with her too, a thing which
seemed a little strange to him then, for he was very much drawn to
her. She was so pretty and cute. Yet she was a working girl, as he
remembered now, too&mdash;a factory girl, as Gilbert would say, and
he was her superior. But she <i>was</i> so pretty and cute.</p>

<p>Instantly he went on to others who had been put on this same
day, and finally coming to Miss Todd asked her to report pretty
soon on how Miss Alden was getting along&mdash;that he wanted to
know.</p>

<p>But at the same time that he had addressed Roberta, and she had
smiled back at him, Ruza Nikoforitch, who was working two tables
away, nudged the girl working next her, and without any one noting
it, first winked, then indicated with a slight movement of the head
both Clyde and Roberta. Her friend was to watch them. And after
Clyde had gone away and Roberta was working as before, she leaned
over and whispered: "He says she'll do already." Then she lifted
her eyebrows and compressed her lips. And her friend replied, so
softly that no one could hear her: "Pretty quick, eh? And he didn't
seem to see any one else at all before."</p>

<p>Then the twain smiled most wisely, a choice bit between them.
Ruza Nikoforitch was jealous.</p>

<h3>Chapter 13</h3>

<p>The reasons why a girl of Roberta's type should be seeking
employment with Griffiths and Company at this time and in this
capacity are of some point. For, somewhat after the fashion of
Clyde in relation to his family and his life, she too considered
her life a great disappointment. She was the daughter of Titus
Alden, a farmer&mdash;of near Biltz, a small town in Mimico County,
some fifty miles north. And from her youth up she had seen little
but poverty. Her father&mdash;the youngest of three sons of Ephraim
Alden, a farmer in this region before him&mdash;was so unsuccessful
that at forty-eight he was still living in a house which, though
old and much in need of repair at the time his father willed it to
him, was now bordering upon a state of dilapidation. The house
itself, while primarily a charming example of that excellent taste
which produced those delightful gabled homes which embellish the
average New England town and street, had been by now so reduced for
want of paint, shingles, and certain flags which had once made a
winding walk from a road gate to the front door, that it presented
a decidedly melancholy aspect to the world, as though it might be
coughing and saying: "Well, things are none too satisfactory with
me."</p>

<p>The interior of the house corresponded with the exterior. The
floor boards and stair boards were loose and creaked most eerily at
times. Some of the windows had shades&mdash;some did not. Furniture
of both an earlier and a later date, but all in a somewhat decayed
condition, intermingled and furnished it in some nondescript manner
which need hardly be described.</p>

<p>As for the parents of Roberta, they were excellent examples of
that native type of Americanism which resists facts and reveres
illusion. Titus Alden was one of that vast company of individuals
who are born, pass through and die out of the world without ever
quite getting any one thing straight. They appear, blunder, and end
in a fog. Like his two brothers, both older and almost as nebulous,
Titus was a farmer solely because his father had been a farmer. And
he was here on this farm because it had been willed to him and
because it was easier to stay here and try to work this than it was
to go elsewhere. He was a Republican because his father before him
was a Republican and because this county was Republican. It never
occurred to him to be otherwise. And, as in the case of his
politics and his religion, he had borrowed all his notions of what
was right and wrong from those about him. A single, serious,
intelligent or rightly informing book had never been read by any
member of this family&mdash;not one. But they were nevertheless
excellent, as conventions, morals and religions go&mdash; honest,
upright, God-fearing and respectable.</p>

<p>In so far as the daughter of these parents was concerned, and in
the face of natural gifts which fitted her for something better
than this world from which she derived, she was still, in part, at
least, a reflection of the religious and moral notions there and
then prevailing,&mdash;the views of the local ministers and the
laity in general. At the same time, because of a warm, imaginative,
sensuous temperament, she was filled&mdash;once she reached fifteen
and sixteen&mdash;with the world-old dream of all of Eve's
daughters from the homeliest to the fairest&mdash;that her beauty
or charm might some day and ere long smite bewitchingly and so
irresistibly the soul of a given man or men.</p>

<p>So it was that although throughout her infancy and girlhood she
was compelled to hear of and share a depriving and toilsome
poverty, still, because of her innate imagination, she was always
thinking of something better. Maybe, some day, who knew, a larger
city like Albany or Utica! A newer and greater life.</p>

<p>And then what dreams! And in the orchard of a spring day later,
between her fourteenth and eighteenth years when the early May sun
was making pink lamps of every aged tree and the ground was pinkly
carpeted with the falling and odorous petals, she would stand and
breathe and sometimes laugh, or even sigh, her arms upreached or
thrown wide to life. To be alive! To have youth and the world
before one. To think of the eyes and the smile of some youth of the
region who by the merest chance had passed her and looked, and who
might never look again, but who, nevertheless, in so doing, had
stirred her young soul to dreams.</p>

<p>None the less she was shy, and hence recessive&mdash;afraid of
men, especially the more ordinary types common to this region. And
these in turn, repulsed by her shyness and refinement, tended to
recede from her, for all of her physical charm, which was too
delicate for this region. Nevertheless, at the age of sixteen,
having repaired to Biltz, in order to work in Appleman's Dry Goods
Store for five dollars a week, she saw many young men who attracted
her. But here because of her mood in regard to her family's
position, as well as the fact that to her inexperienced eyes they
appeared so much better placed than herself, she was convinced that
they would not be interested in her. And here again it was her own
mood that succeeded in alienating them almost completely.
Nevertheless she remained working for Mr. Appleman until she was
between eighteen and nineteen, all the while sensing that she was
really doing nothing for herself because she was too closely
identified with her home and her family, who appeared to need
her.</p>

<p>And then about this time, an almost revolutionary thing for this
part of the world occurred. For because of the cheapness of labor
in such an extremely rural section, a small hosiery plant was built
at Trippetts Mills. And though Roberta, because of the views and
standards that prevailed hereabout, had somehow conceived of this
type of work as beneath her, still she was fascinated by the
reports of the high wages to be paid. Accordingly she repaired to
Trippetts Mills, where, boarding at the house of a neighbor who had
previously lived in Biltz, and returning home every Saturday
afternoon, she planned to bring together the means for some further
form of practical education&mdash;a course at a business college at
Homer or Lycurgus or somewhere which might fit her for something
better&mdash;bookkeeping or stenography.</p>

<p>And in connection with this dream and this attempted saving two
years went by. And in the meanwhile, although she earned more money
(eventually twelve dollars a week), still, because various members
of her family required so many little things and she desired to
alleviate to a degree the privations of these others from which she
suffered, nearly all that she earned went to them.</p>

<p>And again here, as at Biltz, most of the youths of the town who
were better suited to her intellectually and
temperamentally&mdash;still looked upon the mere factory type as
beneath them in many ways. And although Roberta was far from being
that type, still having associated herself with them she was
inclined to absorb some of their psychology in regard to
themselves. Indeed by then she was fairly well satisfied that no
one of these here in whom she was interested would be interested in
her&mdash;at least not with any legitimate intentions.</p>

<p>And then two things occurred which caused her to think, not only
seriously of marriage, but of her own future, whether she married
or not. For her sister, Agnes, now twenty, and three years her
junior, having recently reencountered a young schoolmaster who some
time before had conducted the district school near the Alden farm,
and finding him more to her taste now than when she had been in
school, had decided to marry him. And this meant, as Roberta saw
it, that she was about to take on the appearance of a spinster
unless she married soon. Yet she did not quite see what was to be
done until the hosiery factory at Trippetts Mills suddenly closed,
never to reopen. And then, in order to assist her mother, as well
as help with her sister's wedding, she returned to Biltz.</p>

<p>But then there came a third thing which decidedly affected her
dreams and plans. Grace Marr, a girl whom she had met at Trippetts
Mills, had gone to Lycurgus and after a few weeks there had managed
to connect herself with the Finchley Vacuum Cleaner Company at a
salary of fifteen dollars a week and at once wrote to Roberta
telling her of the opportunities that were then present in
Lycurgus. For in passing the Griffiths Company, which she did
daily, she had seen a large sign posted over the east employment
door reading "Girls Wanted." And inquiry revealed the fact that
girls at this company were always started at nine or ten dollars,
quickly taught some one of the various phases of piece work and
then, once they were proficient, were frequently able to earn as
much as from fourteen to sixteen dollars, according to their skill.
And since board and room were only consuming seven of what she
earned, she was delighted to communicate to Roberta, whom she liked
very much, that she might come and room with her if she wished.</p>

<p>Roberta, having reached the place where she felt that she could
no longer endure farm life but must act for herself once more,
finally arranged with her mother to leave in order that she might
help her more directly with her wages.</p>

<p>But once in Lycurgus and employed by Clyde, her life, after the
first flush of self-interest which a change so great implied for
her, was not so much more enlarged socially or materially either,
for that matter, over what it had been in Biltz and Trippetts
Mills. For, despite the genial intimacy of Grace Marr&mdash;a girl
not nearly as attractive as Roberta, and who, because of Roberta's
charm and for the most part affected gayety, counted on her to
provide a cheer and companionship which otherwise she would have
lacked&mdash;still the world into which she was inducted here was
scarcely any more liberal or diversified than that from which she
sprang.</p>

<p>For, to begin with, the Newtons, sister and brother-in-law of
Grace Marr, with whom she lived, and who, despite the fact that
they were not unkindly, proved to be, almost more so than were the
types with whom, either in Biltz or Trippets Mills, she had been in
constant contact, the most ordinary small town mill
workers&mdash;religious and narrow to a degree. George Newton, as
every one could see and feel, was a pleasant if not very emotional
or romantic person who took his various small plans in regard to
himself and his future as of the utmost importance. Primarily he
was saving what little cash he could out of the wages he earned as
threadman in the Cranston Wickwire factory to enable him to embark
upon some business for which he thought himself fitted. And to this
end, and to further enhance his meager savings, he had joined with
his wife in the scheme of taking over an old house in Taylor Street
which permitted the renting of enough rooms to carry the rent and
in addition to supply the food for the family and five boarders,
counting their labor and worries in the process as nothing. And on
the other hand, Grace Marr, as well as Newton's wife, Mary, were of
that type that here as elsewhere find the bulk of their social
satisfaction in such small matters as relate to the organization of
a small home, the establishing of its import and integrity in a
petty and highly conventional neighborhood and the contemplation of
life and conduct through the lens furnished by a purely sectarian
creed.</p>

<p>And so, once part and parcel of this particular household,
Roberta found after a time, that it, if not Lycurgus, was narrow
and restricted&mdash;not wholly unlike the various narrow and
restricted homes at Biltz. And these lines, according to the
Newtons and their like, to be strictly observed. No good could come
of breaking them. If you were a factory employee you should
accommodate yourself to the world and customs of the better sort of
Christian factory employees. Every day therefore&mdash;and that not
so very long after she had arrived&mdash;she found herself up and
making the best of a not very satisfactory breakfast in the Newton
dining room, which was usually shared by Grace and two other girls
of nearly their own age&mdash;Opal Feliss and Olive Pope&mdash;who
were connected with the Cranston Wickwire Company. Also by a young
electrician by the name of Fred Shurlock, who worked for the City
Lighting Plant. And immediately after breakfast joining a long
procession that day after day at this hour made for the mills
across the river. For just outside her own door she invariably met
with a company of factory girls and women, boys and men, of the
same relative ages, to say nothing of many old and weary-looking
women who looked more like wraiths than human beings, who had
issued from the various streets and houses of this vicinity. And as
the crowd, because of the general inpour into it from various
streets, thickened at Central Avenue, there was much ogling of the
prettier girls by a certain type of factory man, who, not knowing
any of them, still sought, as Roberta saw it, unlicensed contacts
and even worse. Yet there was much giggling and simpering on the
part of girls of a certain type who were by no means as severe as
most of those she had known elsewhere. Shocking!</p>

<p>And at night the same throng, re-forming at the mills, crossing
the bridge at the depot and returning as it had come. And Roberta,
because of her social and moral training and mood, and in spite of
her decided looks and charm and strong desires, feeling alone and
neglected. Oh, how sad to see the world so gay and she so lonely.
And it was always after six when she reached home. And after dinner
there was really nothing much of anything to do unless she and
Grace attended one or another of the moving picture theaters or she
could bring herself to consent to join the Newtons and Grace at a
meeting of the Methodist Church.</p>

<p>None the less once part and parcel of this household and working
for Clyde she was delighted with the change. This big city. This
fine Central Avenue with its stores and moving picture theaters.
These great mills. And again this Mr. Griffiths, so young,
attractive, smiling and interested in her.</p>

<h3>Chapter 14</h3>

<p>In the same way Clyde, on encountering her, was greatly stirred.
Since the abortive contact with Dillard, Rita and Zella, and
afterwards the seemingly meaningless invitation to the Griffiths
with its introduction to and yet only passing glimpse of such
personages as Bella, Sondra Finchley and Bertine Cranston, he was
lonely indeed. That high world! But plainly he was not to be
allowed to share in it. And yet because of his vain hope in
connection with it, he had chosen to cut himself off in this way.
And to what end? Was he not if anything more lonely than ever? Mrs.
Peyton! Going to and from his work but merely nodding to people or
talking casually&mdash;or however sociably with one or another of
the storekeepers along Central Avenue who chose to hail
him&mdash;or even some of the factory girls here in whom he was not
interested or with whom he did not dare to develop a friendship.
What was that? Just nothing really. And yet as an offset to all
this, of course, was he not a Griffiths and so entitled to their
respect and reverence even on this account? What a situation
really! What to do!</p>

<p>And at the same time, this Roberta Alden, once she was placed
here in this fashion and becoming more familiar with local
conditions, as well as the standing of Clyde, his charm, his
evasive and yet sensible interest in her, was becoming troubled as
to her state too. For once part and parcel of this local home she
had joined she was becoming conscious of various local taboos and
restrictions which made it seem likely that never at any time here
would it be possible to express an interest in Clyde or any one
above her officially. For there was a local taboo in regard to
factory girls aspiring toward or allowing themselves to become
interested in their official superiors. Religious, moral and
reserved girls didn't do it. And again, as she soon discovered, the
line of demarcation and stratification between the rich and the
poor in Lycurgus was as sharp as though cut by a knife or divided
by a high wall. And another taboo in regard to all the foreign
family girls and men,&mdash;ignorant, low, immoral, un-American!
One should&mdash;above all&mdash;have nothing to do with them.</p>

<p>But among these people as she could see&mdash;the religious and
moral, lower middle-class group to which she and all of her
intimates belonged&mdash;dancing or local adventurous gayety, such
as walking the streets or going to a moving picture
theater&mdash;was also taboo. And yet she, herself, at this time,
was becoming interested in dancing. Worse than this, the various
young men and girls of the particular church which she and Grace
Marr attended at first, were not inclined to see Roberta or Grace
as equals, since they, for the most part, were members of older and
more successful families of the town. And so it was that after a
very few weeks of attendance of church affairs and services, they
were about where they had been when they started&mdash;conventional
and acceptable, but without the amount of entertainment and
diversion which was normally reaching those who were of their same
church but better placed.</p>

<p>And so it was that Roberta, after encountering Clyde and sensing
the superior world in which she imagined he moved, and being so
taken with the charm of his personality, was seized with the very
virus of ambition and unrest that afflicted him. And every day that
she went to the factory now she could not help but feel that his
eyes were upon her in a quiet, seeking and yet doubtful way. Yet
she also felt that he was too uncertain as to what she would think
of any overture that he might make in her direction to risk a
repulse or any offensive interpretation on her part. And yet at
times, after the first two weeks of her stay here, she wishing that
he would speak to her&mdash;that he would make some
beginning&mdash;at other times that he must not dare&mdash;that it
would be dreadful and impossible. The other girls there would see
at once. And since they all plainly felt that he was too good or
too remote for them, they would at once note that he was making an
exception in her case and would put their own interpretation on it.
And she knew the type of a girl who worked in the Griffiths
stamping room would put but one interpretation on it,&mdash;that of
looseness.</p>

<p>At the same time in so far as Clyde and his leaning toward her
was concerned there was that rule laid down by Gilbert. And
although, because of it, he had hitherto appeared not to notice or
to give any more attention to one girl than another, still, once
Roberta arrived, he was almost unconsciously inclined to drift by
her table and pause in her vicinity to see how she was progressing.
And, as he saw from the first, she was a quick and intelligent
worker, soon mastering without much advice of any kind all the
tricks of the work, and thereafter earning about as much as any of
the others&mdash; fifteen dollars a week. And her manner was always
that of one who enjoyed it and was happy to have the privilege of
working here. And pleased to have him pay any little attention to
her.</p>

<p>At the same time he noted to his surprise and especially since
to him she seemed so refined and different, a certain exuberance
and gayety that was not only emotional, but in a delicate poetic
way, sensual. Also that despite her difference and reserve she was
able to make friends with and seemed to be able to understand the
viewpoint of most of the foreign girls who were essentially so
different from her. For, listening to her discuss the work here,
first with Lena Schlict, Hoda Petkanas, Angelina Pitti and some
others who soon chose to speak to her, he reached the conclusion
that she was not nearly so conventional or standoffish as most of
the other American girls. And yet she did not appear to lose their
respect either.</p>

<p>Thus, one noontime, coming back from the office lunch downstairs
a little earlier than usual, he found her and several of the
foreign-family girls, as well as four of the American girls,
surrounding Polish Mary, one of the gayest and roughest of the
foreign-family girls, who was explaining in rather a high key how a
certain "feller" whom she had met the night before had given her a
beaded bag, and for what purpose.</p>

<p>"I should go with heem to be his sweetheart," she announced with
a flourish, the while she waved the bag before the interested
group. "And I say, I tack heem an' think on heem. Pretty nice bag,
eh?" she added, holding it aloft and turning it about. "Tell me,"
she added with provoking and yet probably only mock serious eyes
and waving the bag toward Roberta, "what shall I do with heem? Keep
heem an' go with heem to be his sweetheart or give heem back? I
like heem pretty much, that bag, you bet."</p>

<p>And although, according to the laws of her upbringing, as Clyde
suspected, Roberta should have been shocked by all this, she was
not, as he noticed&mdash;far from it. If one might have judged from
her face, she was very much amused.</p>

<p>Instantly she replied with a gay smile: "Well, it all depends on
how handsome he is, Mary. If he's very attractive, I think I'd
string him along for a while, anyhow, and keep the bag as long as I
could."</p>

<p>"Oh, but he no wait," declared Mary archly, and with plainly a
keen sense of the riskiness of the situation, the while she winked
at Clyde who had drawn near. "I got to give heem bag or be
sweetheart to-night, and so swell bag I never can buy myself." She
eyed the bag archly and roguishly, her own nose crinkling with the
humor of the situation. "What I do then?"</p>

<p>"Gee, this is pretty strong stuff for a little country girl like
Miss Alden. She won't like this, maybe," thought Clyde to
himself.</p>

<p>However, Roberta, as he now saw, appeared to be equal to the
situation, for she pretended to be troubled. "Gee, you are in a
fix," she commented. "I don't know what you'll do now." She opened
her eyes wide and pretended to be greatly concerned. However, as
Clyde could see, she was merely acting, but carrying it off very
well.</p>

<p>And frizzled-haired Dutch Lena now leaned over to say: "I take
it and him too, you bet, if you don't want him. Where is he? I got
no feller now." She reached over as if to take the bag from Mary,
who as quickly withdrew it. And there were squeals of delight from
nearly all the girls in the room, who were amused by this eccentric
horseplay. Even Roberta laughed loudly, a fact which Clyde noted
with pleasure, for he liked all this rough humor, considering it
mere innocent play.</p>

<p>"Well, maybe you're right, Lena," he heard her add just as the
whistle blew and the hundreds of sewing machines in the next room
began to hum. "A good man isn't to be found every day." Her blue
eyes were twinkling and her lips, which were most temptingly
modeled, were parted in a broad smile. There was much banter and
more bluff in what she said than anything else, as Clyde could see,
but he felt that she was not nearly as narrow as he had feared. She
was human and gay and tolerant and good-natured. There was
decidedly a very liberal measure of play in her. And in spite of
the fact that her clothes were poor, the same little round brown
hat and blue cloth dress that she had worn on first coming to work
here, she was prettier than anyone else. And she never needed to
paint her lips and cheeks like the foreign girls, whose faces at
times looked like pink-frosted cakes. And how pretty were her arms
and neck&mdash;plump and gracefully designed! And there was a
certain grace and abandon about her as she threw herself into her
work as though she really enjoyed it. As she worked fast during the
hottest portions of the day, there would gather on her upper lip
and chin and forehead little beads of perspiration which she was
always pausing in her work to touch with her handkerchief, while to
him, like jewels, they seemed only to enhance her charm.</p>

<p>Wonderful days, these, now for Clyde. For once more and here,
where he could be near her the long day through, he had a girl whom
he could study and admire and by degrees proceed to crave with all
of the desire of which he seemed to be capable&mdash;and with which
he had craved Hortense Briggs&mdash;only with more satisfaction,
since as he saw it she was simpler, more kindly and respectable.
And though for quite a while at first Roberta appeared or pretended
to be quite indifferent to or unconscious of him, still from the
very first this was not true. She was only troubled as to the
appropriate attitude for her. The beauty of his face and
hands&mdash; the blackness and softness of his hair, the darkness
and melancholy and lure of his eyes. He was attractive&mdash;oh,
very. Beautiful, really, to her.</p>

<p>And then one day shortly thereafter, Gilbert Griffiths walking
through here and stopping to talk to Clyde, she was led to imagine
by this that Clyde was really much more of a figure socially and
financially than she had previously thought. For just as Gilbert
was approaching, Lena Schlict, who was working beside her, leaned
over to say: "Here comes Mr. Gilbert Griffiths. His father owns
this whole factory and when he dies, he'll get it, they say. And
he's his cousin," she added, nodding toward Clyde. "They look a lot
alike, don't they?"</p>

<p>"Yes, they do," replied Roberta, slyly studying not only Clyde
but Gilbert, "only I think Mr. Clyde Griffiths is a little nicer
looking, don't you?"</p>

<p>Hoda Petkanas, sitting on the other side of Roberta and
overhearing this last remark, laughed. "That's what every one here
thinks. He's not stuck up like that Mr. Gilbert Griffiths,
either."</p>

<p>"Is he rich, too?" inquired Roberta, thinking of Clyde.</p>

<p>"I don't know. They say not," she pursed her lips dubiously,
herself rather interested in Clyde along with the others. "He
worked down in the shrinking room before he came up here. He was
just working by the day, I guess. But he only came on here a little
while ago to learn the business. Maybe he won't work in here much
longer."</p>

<p>Roberta was suddenly troubled by this last remark. She had not
been thinking, or so she had been trying to tell herself, of Clyde
in any romantic way, and yet the thought that he might suddenly go
at any moment, never to be seen by her any more, disturbed her now.
He was so youthful, so brisk, so attractive. And so interested in
her, too. Yes, that was plain. It was wrong to think that he would
be interested in her&mdash;or to try to attract him by any least
gesture of hers, since he was so important a person here&mdash;far
above her.</p>

<p>For, true to her complex, the moment she heard that Clyde was so
highly connected and might even have money, she was not so sure
that he could have any legitimate interest in her. For was she not
a poor working girl? And was he not a very rich man's nephew? He
would not marry her, of course. And what other legitimate thing
would he want with her? She must be on her guard in regard to
him.</p>

<h3>Chapter 15</h3>

<p>The thoughts of Clyde at this time in regard to Roberta and his
general situation in Lycurgus were for the most part confused and
disturbing. For had not Gilbert warned him against associating with
the help here? On the other hand, in so far as his actual daily
life was concerned, his condition was socially the same as before.
Apart from the fact that his move to Mrs. Peyton's had taken him
into a better street and neighborhood, he was really not so well
off as he had been at Mrs. Cuppy's. For there at least he had been
in touch with those young people who would have been diverting
enough had he felt that it would have been wise to indulge them.
But now, aside from a bachelor brother who was as old as Mrs.
Peyton herself, and a son thirty&mdash;slim and reserved, who was
connected with one of the Lycurgus banks&mdash;he saw no one who
could or would trouble to entertain him. Like the others with whom
he came in contact, they thought him possessed of relationships
which would make it unnecessary and even a bit presumptuous for
them to suggest ways and means of entertaining him.</p>

<p>On the other hand, while Roberta was not of that high world to
which he now aspired, still there was that about her which enticed
him beyond measure. Day after day and because so much alone, and
furthermore because of so strong a chemic or temperamental pull
that was so definitely asserting itself, he could no longer keep
his eyes off her&mdash;or she hers from him. There were evasive and
yet strained and feverish eye-flashes between them. And after one
such in his case&mdash;a quick and furtive glance on her part at
times&mdash;by no means intended to be seen by him, he found
himself weak and then feverish. Her pretty mouth, her lovely big
eyes, her radiant and yet so often shy and evasive smile. And, oh,
she had such pretty arms&mdash;such a trim, lithe, sentient, quick
figure and movements. If he only dared be friendly with
her&mdash;venture to talk with and then see her somewhere
afterwards&mdash;if she only would and if he only dared.</p>

<p>Confusion. Aspiration. Hours of burning and yearning. For indeed
he was not only puzzled but irritated by the anomalous and
paradoxical contrasts which his life here
presented&mdash;loneliness and wistfulness as against the fact that
it was being generally assumed by such as knew him that he was
rather pleasantly and interestingly employed socially.</p>

<p>Therefore in order to enjoy himself in some way befitting his
present rank, and to keep out of the sight of those who were
imagining that he was being so much more handsomely entertained
than he was, he had been more recently, on Saturday afternoons and
Sundays, making idle sightseeing trips to Gloversville, Fonda,
Amsterdam and other places, as well as Gray and Crum Lakes, where
there were boats, beaches and bathhouses, with bathing suits for
rent. And there, because he was always thinking that if by chance
he should be taken up by the Griffiths, he would need as many
social accomplishments as possible, and by reason of encountering a
man who took a fancy to him and who could both swim and dive, he
learned to do both exceedingly well. But canoeing fascinated him
really. He was pleased by the picturesque and summery appearance he
made in an outing shirt and canvas shoes paddling about Crum Lake
in one of the bright red or green or blue canoes that were leased
by the hour. And at such times these summer scenes appeared to
possess an airy, fairy quality, especially with a summer cloud or
two hanging high above in the blue. And so his mind indulged itself
in day dreams as to how it would feel to be a member of one of the
wealthy groups that frequented the more noted resorts of the
north&mdash;Racquette Lake&mdash;Schroon Lake&mdash;Lake George and
Champlain&mdash; dance, golf, tennis, canoe with those who could
afford to go to such places&mdash;the rich of Lycurgus.</p>

<p>But it was about this time that Roberta with her friend Grace
found Crum Lake and had decided on it, with the approval of Mr. and
Mrs. Newton, as one of the best and most reserved of all the
smaller watering places about here. And so it was that they, too,
were already given to riding out to the pavilion on a Saturday or
Sunday afternoon, and once there following the west shore along
which ran a well-worn footpath which led to clumps of trees,
underneath which they sat and looked at the water, for neither
could row a boat or swim. Also there were wild flowers and berry
bushes to be plundered. And from certain marshy spots, to be
reached by venturing out for a score of feet or more, it was
possible to reach and take white lilies with their delicate yellow
hearts. They were decidedly tempting and on two occasions already
the marauders had brought Mrs. Newton large armfuls of blooms from
the fields and shore line here.</p>

<p>On the third Sunday afternoon in July, Clyde, as lonely and
rebellious as ever, was paddling about in a dark blue canoe along
the south bank of the lake about a mile and a half from the
boathouse. His coat and hat were off, and in a seeking and half
resentful mood he was imagining vain things in regard to the type
of life he would really like to lead. At different points on the
lake in canoes, or their more clumsy companions, the row-boats,
were boys and girls, men and women. And over the water occasionally
would come their laughter or bits of their conversation. And in the
distance would be other canoes and other dreamers, happily in love,
as Clyde invariably decided, that being to him the sharpest
contrast to his own lorn state.</p>

<p>At any rate, the sight of any other youth thus romantically
engaged with his girl was sufficient to set dissonantly jangling
the repressed and protesting libido of his nature. And this would
cause his mind to paint another picture in which, had fortune
favored him in the first place by birth, he would now be in some
canoe on Schroon or Racquette or Champlain Lake with Sondra
Finchley or some such girl, paddling and looking at the shores of a
scene more distingue than this. Or might he not be riding or
playing tennis, or in the evening dancing or racing from place to
place in some high-powered car, Sondra by his side? He felt so out
of it, so lonely and restless and tortured by all that he saw here,
for everywhere that he looked he seemed to see love, romance,
contentment. What to do? Where to go? He could not go on alone like
this forever. He was too miserable.</p>

<p>In memory as well as mood his mind went back to the few gay
happy days he had enjoyed in Kansas City before that dreadful
accident&mdash; Ratterer, Hegglund, Higby, Tina Kogel, Hortense,
Ratterer's sister Louise&mdash;in short, the gay company of which
he was just beginning to be a part when that terrible accident had
occurred. And next to Dillard, Rita, Zella,&mdash;a companionship
that would have been better than this, certainly. Were the
Griffiths never going to do any more for him than this? Had he only
come here to be sneered at by his cousin, pushed aside, or rather
completely ignored by all the bright company of which the children
of his rich uncle were a part? And so plainly, from so many
interesting incidents, even now in this dead summertime, he could
see how privileged and relaxed and apparently decidedly happy were
those of that circle. Notices in the local papers almost every day
as to their coming and going here and there, the large and
expensive cars of Samuel as well as Gilbert Griffiths parked
outside the main office entrance on such days as they were in
Lycurgus&mdash;an occasional group of young society figures to be
seen before the grill of the Lycurgus Hotel, or before one of the
fine homes in Wykeagy Avenue, some one having returned to the city
for an hour or a night.</p>

<p>And in the factory itself, whenever either was
there&mdash;Gilbert or Samuel&mdash;in the smartest of summer
clothes and attended by either Messrs. Smillie, Latch, Gotboy or
Burkey, all high officials of the company, making a most austere
and even regal round of the immense plant and consulting with or
listening to the reports of the various minor department heads. And
yet here was he&mdash;a full cousin to this same Gilbert, a nephew
to this distinguished Samuel&mdash;being left to drift and pine by
himself, and for no other reason than, as he could now clearly see,
he was not good enough. His father was not as able as this, his
great uncle&mdash;his mother (might Heaven keep her) not as
distinguished or as experienced as his cold, superior, indifferent
aunt. Might it not be best to leave? Had he not made a foolish
move, after all, in coming on here? What, if anything, did these
high relatives ever intend to do for him?</p>

<p>In loneliness and resentment and disappointment, his mind now
wandered from the Griffiths and their world, and particularly that
beautiful Sondra Finchley, whom he recalled with a keen and biting
thrill, to Roberta and the world which she as well as he was
occupying here. For although a poor factory girl, she was still so
much more attractive than any of these other girls with whom he was
every day in contact.</p>

<p>How unfair and ridiculous for the Griffiths to insist that a man
in his position should not associate with a girl such as Roberta,
for instance, and just because she worked in the mill. He might not
even make friends with her and bring her to some such lake as this
or visit her in her little home on account of that. And yet he
could not go with others more worthy of him, perhaps, for lack of
means or contacts. And besides she was so
attractive&mdash;very&mdash;and especially enticing to him. He
could see her now as she worked with her swift, graceful movements
at her machine. Her shapely arms and hands, her smooth skin and her
bright eyes as she smiled up at him. And his thoughts were played
over by exactly the same emotions that swept him so regularly at
the factory. For poor or not&mdash;a working girl by misfortune
only&mdash;he could see how he could be very happy with her if only
he did not need to marry her. For now his ambitions toward marriage
had been firmly magnetized by the world to which the Griffiths
belonged. And yet his desires were most colorfully inflamed by her,
if only he might venture to talk to her more&mdash;to walk home
with her some day from the mill&mdash;to bring her out here to this
lake on a Saturday or Sunday, and row about&mdash; just to idle and
dream with her.</p>

<p>He rounded a point studded with a clump of trees and bushes and
covering a shallow where were scores of water lilies afloat, their
large leaves resting flat upon the still water of the lake. And on
the bank to the left was a girl standing and looking at them. She
had her hat off and one hand to her eyes for she was facing the sun
and was looking down in the water. Her lips were parted in careless
inquiry. She was very pretty, he thought, as he paused in his
paddling to look at her. The sleeves of a pale blue waist came only
to her elbows. And a darker blue skirt of flannel reconveyed to him
the trimness of her figure. It wasn't Roberta! It couldn't be! Yes,
it was!</p>

<p>Almost before he had decided, he was quite beside her, some
twenty feet from the shore, and was looking up at her, his face lit
by the radiance of one who had suddenly, and beyond his belief,
realized a dream. And as though he were a pleasant apparition
suddenly evoked out of nothing and nowhere, a poetic effort taking
form out of smoke or vibrant energy, she in turn stood staring down
at him, her lips unable to resist the wavy line of beauty that a
happy mood always brought to them.</p>

<p>"My, Miss Alden! It is you, isn't it?" he called. "I was
wondering whether it was. I couldn't be sure from out there."</p>

<p>"Why, yes it is," she laughed, puzzled, and again just the least
bit abashed by the reality of him. For in spite of her obvious
pleasure at seeing him again, only thinly repressed for the first
moment or two, she was on the instant beginning to be troubled by
her thoughts in regard to him&mdash;the difficulties that contact
with him seemed to prognosticate. For this meant contact and
friendship, maybe, and she was no longer in any mood to resist him,
whatever people might think. And yet here was her friend, Grace
Marr. Would she want her to know of Clyde and her interest in him?
She was troubled. And yet she could not resist smiling and looking
at him in a frank and welcoming way. She had been thinking of him
so much and wishing for him in some happy, secure, commendable way.
And now here he was. And there could be nothing more innocent than
his presence here&mdash;nor hers.</p>

<p>"Just out for a walk?" he forced himself to say, although,
because of his delight and his fear of her really, he felt not a
little embarrassed now that she was directly before him. At the
same time he added, recalling that she had been looking so intently
at the water: "You want some of these water lilies? Is that what
you're looking for?"</p>

<p>"Uh, huh," she replied, still smiling and looking directly at
him, for the sight of his dark hair blown by the wind, the pale
blue outing shirt he wore open at the neck, his sleeves rolled up
and the yellow paddle held by him above the handsome blue boat,
quite thrilled her. If only she could win such a youth for her very
own self&mdash;just hers and no one else's in the whole world. It
seemed as though this would be paradise&mdash;that if she could
have him she would never want anything else in all the world. And
here at her very feet he sat now in this bright canoe on this clear
July afternoon in this summery world&mdash;so new and pleasing to
her. And now he was laughing up at her so directly and admiringly.
Her girl friend was far in the rear somewhere looking for daisies.
Could she? Should she?</p>

<p>"I was seeing if there was any way to get out to any of them,"
she continued a little nervously, a tremor almost revealing itself
in her voice. "I haven't seen any before just here on this
side."</p>

<p>"I'll get you all you want," he exclaimed briskly and gayly.
"You just stay where you are. I'll bring them." But then,
bethinking him of how much more lovely it would be if she were to
get in with him, he added: "But see here&mdash;why don't you get in
here with me? There's plenty of room and I can take you anywhere
you want to go. There's lots nicer lilies up the lake here a little
way and on the other side too. I saw hundreds of them over there
just beyond that island."</p>

<p>Roberta looked. And as she did, another canoe paddled by,
holding a youth of about Clyde's years and a girl no older than
herself. She wore a white dress and a pink hat and the canoe was
green. And far across the water at the point of the very island
about which Clyde was talking was another canoe&mdash;bright yellow
with a boy and a girl in that. She was thinking she would like to
get in without her companion, if possible&mdash;with her, if need
be. She wanted so much to have him all to herself. If she had only
come out here alone. For if Grace Marr were included, she would
know and later talk, maybe, or think, if she heard anything else in
regard to them ever. And yet if she did not, there was the fear
that he might not like her any more&mdash;might even come to
dislike her or give up being interested in her, and that would be
dreadful.</p>

<p>She stood staring and thinking, and Clyde, troubled and pained
by her doubt on this occasion and his own loneliness and desire for
her, suddenly called: "Oh, please don't say no. Just get in, won't
you? You'll like it. I want you to. Then we can find all the lilies
you want. I can let you out anywhere you want to get out&mdash;in
ten minutes if you want to."</p>

<p>She marked the "I want you to." It soothed and strengthened her.
He had no desire to take any advantage of her as she could see.</p>

<p>"But I have my friend with me here," she exclaimed almost sadly
and dubiously, for she still wanted to go alone&mdash;never in her
life had she wanted any one less than Grace Marr at this moment.
Why had she brought her? She wasn't so very pretty and Clyde might
not like her, and that might spoil the occasion. "Besides," she
added almost in the same breath and with many thoughts fighting
her, "maybe I'd better not. Is it safe?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, maybe you better had," laughed Clyde seeing that she
was yielding. "It's perfectly safe," he added eagerly. Then
maneuvering the canoe next to the bank, which was a foot above the
water, and laying hold of a root to hold it still, he said: "Of
course you won't be in any danger. Call your friend then, if you
want to, and I'll row the two of you. There's room for two and
there are lots of water lilies everywhere over there." He nodded
toward the east side of the lake.</p>

<p>Roberta could no longer resist and seized an overhanging branch
by which to steady herself. At the same time she began to call:
"Oh, Gray-ace! Gray-ace! Where are you?" for she had at last
decided that it was best to include her.</p>

<p>A far-off voice as quickly answered: "Hello-o! What do you
want?"</p>

<p>"Come up here. Come on. I got something I want to tell you."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, you come on down here. The daisies are just
wonderful."</p>

<p>"No, you come on up here. There's some one here that wants to
take us boating." She intended to call this loudly, but somehow her
voice failed and her friend went on gathering flowers. Roberta
frowned. She did not know just what to do. "Oh, very well, then,"
she suddenly decided, and straightening up added: "We can row down
to where she is, I guess."</p>

<p>And Clyde, delighted, exclaimed: "Oh, that's just fine. Sure. Do
get in. We'll pick these here first and then if she hasn't come,
I'll paddle down nearer to where she is. Just step square in the
center and that will balance it."</p>

<p>He was leaning back and looking up at her and Roberta was
looking nervously and yet warmly into his eyes. Actually it was as
though she were suddenly diffused with joy, enveloped in a rosy
mist.</p>

<p>She balanced one foot. "Will it be perfectly safe?"</p>

<p>"Sure, sure," emphasized Clyde. "I'll hold it safe. Just take
hold of that branch there and steady yourself by that." He held the
boat very still as she stepped. Then, as the canoe careened
slightly to one side, she dropped to the cushioned seat with a
little cry. It was like that of a baby to Clyde.</p>

<p>"It's all right," he reassured her. "Just sit in the center
there. It won't tip over. Gee, but this is funny. I can't make it
out quite. You know just as I was coming around that point I was
thinking of you&mdash;how maybe you might like to come out to a
place like this sometime. And now here you are and here I am, and
it all happened just like that." He waved his hand and snapped his
fingers.</p>

<p>And Roberta, fascinated by this confession and yet a little
frightened by it, added: "Is that so?" She was thinking of her own
thoughts in regard to him.</p>

<p>"Yes, and what's more," added Clyde, "I've been thinking of you
all day, really. That's the truth. I was wishing I might see you
somewhere this morning and bring you out here."</p>

<p>"Oh, now, Mr. Griffiths. You know you don't mean that," pleaded
Roberta, fearful lest this sudden contact should take too intimate
and sentimental a turn too quickly. She scarcely liked that because
she was afraid of him and herself, and now she looked at him,
trying to appear a little cold or at least disinterested, but it
was a very weak effort.</p>

<p>"That's the truth, though, just the same," insisted Clyde.</p>

<p>"Well, I think it is beautiful myself," admitted Roberta. "I've
been out here, too, several times now. My friend and I." Clyde was
once more delighted. She was smiling now and full of wonder.</p>

<p>"Oh, have you?" he exclaimed, and there was more talk as to why
he liked to come out and how he had learned to swim here. "And to
think I turned in here and there you were on the bank, looking at
those water lilies. Wasn't that queer? I almost fell out of the
boat. I don't think I ever saw you look as pretty as you did just
now standing there."</p>

<p>"Oh, now, Mr. Griffiths," again pleaded Roberta cautiously. "You
mustn't begin that way. I'll be afraid you're a dreadful flatterer.
I'll have to think you are if you say anything like that so
quickly."</p>

<p>Clyde once more gazed at her weakly, and she smiled because she
thought he was more handsome than ever. But what would he think,
she added to herself, if she were to tell him that just before he
came around that point she was thinking of him too, and wishing
that he were there with her, and not Grace. And how they might sit
and talk, and hold hands perhaps. He might even put his arms around
her waist, and she might let him. That would be terrible, as some
people here would see it, she knew. And it would never do for him
to know that&mdash;never. That would be too intimate&mdash;too
bold. But just the same it was so. Yet what would these people here
in Lycurgus think of her and him now if they should see her,
letting him paddle her about in this canoe! He a factory manager
and she an employee in his department. The conclusion! The scandal,
maybe, even. And yet Grace Marr was along&mdash;or soon would be.
And she could explain to her&mdash;surely. He was out rowing and
knew her, and why shouldn't he help her get some lilies if he
wanted to? It was almost unavoidable&mdash;this present situation,
wasn't it?</p>

<p>Already Clyde had maneuvered the canoe around so that they were
now among the water lilies. And as he talked, having laid his
paddle aside, he had been reaching over and pulling them up,
tossing them with their long, wet stems at her feet as she lay
reclining in the seat, one hand over the side of the canoe in the
water, as she had seen other girls holding theirs. And for the
moment her thoughts were allayed and modified by the beauty of his
head and arms and the tousled hair that now fell over his eyes. How
handsome he was!</p>

<h3>Chapter 16</h3>

<p>The outcome of that afternoon was so wonderful for both that for
days thereafter neither could cease thinking about it or marveling
that anything so romantic and charming should have brought them
together so intimately when both were considering that it was not
wise for either to know the other any better than employee and
superior.</p>

<p>After a few moments of badinage in the boat in which he had
talked about the beauty of the lilies and how glad he was to get
them for her, they picked up her friend, Grace, and eventually
returned to the boathouse.</p>

<p>Once on the land again there developed not a little hesitation
on her part as well as his as to how farther to proceed, for they
were confronted by the problem of returning into Lycurgus together.
As Roberta saw it, it would not look right and might create talk.
And on his part, he was thinking of Gilbert and other people he
knew. The trouble that might come of it. What Gilbert would say if
he did hear. And so both he and she, as well as Grace, were dubious
on the instant about the wisdom of riding back together. Grace's
own reputation, as well as the fact that she knew Clyde was not
interested in her, piqued her. And Roberta, realizing this from her
manner, said: "What do you think we had better do, excuse
ourselves?"</p>

<p>At once Roberta tried to think just how they could extricate
themselves gracefully without offending Clyde. Personally she was
so enchanted that had she been alone she would have preferred to
have ridden back with him. But with Grace here and in this cautious
mood, never. She must think up some excuse.</p>

<p>And at the same time, Clyde was wondering just how he was to do
now&mdash;ride in with them and brazenly face the possibility of
being seen by some one who might carry the news to Gilbert
Griffiths or evade doing so on some pretext or other. He could
think of none, however, and was about to turn and accompany them to
the car when the young electrician, Shurlock, who lived in the
Newton household and who had been on the balcony of the pavilion,
hailed them. He was with a friend who had a small car, and they
were ready to return to the city.</p>

<p>"Well, here's luck," he exclaimed. "How are you, Miss Alden? How
do you do, Miss Marr? You two don't happen to be going our way, do
you? If you are, we can take you in with us."</p>

<p>Not only Roberta but Clyde heard. And at once she was about to
say that, since it was a little late and she and Grace were
scheduled to attend church services with the Newtons, it would be
more convenient for them to return this way. She was, however, half
hoping that Shurlock would invite Clyde and that he would accept.
But on his doing so, Clyde instantly refused. He explained that he
had decided to stay out a little while longer. And so Roberta left
him with a look that conveyed clearly enough the gratitude and
delight she felt. They had had such a good time. And he in turn, in
spite of many qualms as to the wisdom of all this, fell to brooding
on how sad it was that just he and Roberta might not have remained
here for hours longer. And immediately after they had gone, he
returned to the city alone.</p>

<p>The next morning he was keener than ever to see Roberta again.
And although the peculiarly exposed nature of the work at the
factory made it impossible for him to demonstrate his feelings,
still by the swift and admiring and seeking smiles that played over
his face and blazed in his eyes, she knew that he was as
enthusiastic, if not more so, as on the night before. And on her
part, although she felt that a crisis of some sort was impending,
and in spite of the necessity of a form of secrecy which she
resented, she could not refrain from giving him a warm and quite
yielding glance in return. The wonder of his being interested in
her! The wonder and the thrill!</p>

<p>Clyde decided at once that his attentions were still welcome.
Also that he might risk saying something to her, supposing that a
suitable opportunity offered. And so, after waiting an hour and
seeing two fellow workers leave from either side of her, he seized
the occasion to drift near and to pick up one of the collars she
had just stamped, saying, as though talking about that: "I was
awfully sorry to have to leave you last night. I wish we were out
there again to-day instead of here, just you and me, don't
you?"</p>

<p>Roberta turned, conscious that now was the time to decide
whether she would encourage or discourage any attention on his
part. At the same time she was almost faintingly eager to accept
his attentions regardless of the problem in connection with them.
His eyes! His hair! His hands! And then instead of rebuking or
chilling him in any way, she only looked, but with eyes too weak
and melting to mean anything less than yielding and uncertainty.
Clyde saw that she was hopelessly and helplessly drawn to him, as
indeed he was to her. On the instant he was resolved to say
something more, when he could, as to where they could meet when no
one was along, for it was plain that she was no more anxious to be
observed than he was. He well knew more sharply to-day than ever
before that he was treading on dangerous ground.</p>

<p>He began to make mistakes in his calculations, to feel that,
with her so near him, he was by no means concentrating on the
various tasks before him. She was too enticing, too compelling in
so many ways to him. There was something so warm and gay and
welcome about her that he felt that if he could persuade her to
love him he would be among the most fortunate of men. Yet there was
that rule, and although on the lake the day before he had been
deciding that his position here was by no means as satisfactory as
it should be, still with Roberta in it, as now it seemed she well
might be, would it not be much more delightful for him to stay?
Could he not, for the time being at least, endure the further
indifference of the Griffiths? And who knows, might they not yet
become interested in him as a suitable social figure if only he did
nothing to offend them? And yet here he was attempting to do
exactly the thing he had been forbidden to do. What kind of an
injunction was this, anyhow, wherewith Gilbert had enjoined him? If
he could come to some understanding with her, perhaps she would
meet him in some clandestine way and thus obviate all possibility
of criticism.</p>

<p>It was thus that Clyde, seated at his desk or walking about, was
thinking. For now his mind, even in the face of his duties, was
almost entirely engaged by her, and he could think of nothing else.
He had decided to suggest that they meet for the first time, if she
would, in a small park which was just west of the first outlying
resort on the Mohawk. But throughout the day, so close to each
other did the girls work, he had no opportunity to communicate with
her. Indeed noontime came and he went below to his lunch, returning
a little early in the hope of finding her sufficiently detached to
permit him to whisper that he wished to see her somewhere. But she
was surrounded by others at the time and so the entire afternoon
went by without a single opportunity.</p>

<p>However, as he was going out, he bethought him that if he should
chance to meet her alone somewhere in the street, he would venture
to speak to her. For she wanted him to&mdash;that he knew,
regardless of what she might say at any time. And he must find some
way that would appear as accidental and hence as innocent to her as
to others. But as the whistle blew and she left the building she
was joined by another girl, and he was left to think of some other
way.</p>

<p>That same evening, however, instead of lingering about the
Peyton house or going to a moving picture theater, as he so often
did now, or walking alone somewhere in order to allay his unrest
and loneliness, he chose now instead to seek out the home of
Roberta on Taylor Street. It was not a pleasing house, as he now
decided, not nearly so attractive as Mrs. Cuppy's or the house in
which he now dwelt. It was too old and brown, the neighborhood too
nondescript, if conservative. But the lights in different rooms
glowing at this early hour gave it a friendly and genial look. And
the few trees in front were pleasant. What was Roberta doing now?
Why couldn't she have waited for him in the factory? Why couldn't
she sense now that he was outside and come out? He wished intensely
that in some way he could make her feel that he was out here, and
so cause her to come out. But she didn't. On the contrary, he
observed Mr. Shurlock issue forth and disappear toward Central
Avenue. And, after that, pedestrian after pedestrian making their
way out of different houses along the street and toward Central,
which caused him to walk briskly about the block in order to avoid
being seen. At the same time he sighed often, because it was such a
fine night&mdash; a full moon rising about nine-thirty and hanging
heavy and yellow over the chimney tops. He was so lonely.</p>

<p>But at ten, the moon becoming too bright, and no Roberta
appearing, he decided to leave. It was not wise to be hanging about
here. But the night being so fine he resented the thought of his
room and instead walked up and down Wykeagy Avenue, looking at the
fine houses there&mdash;his uncle Samuel's among them. Now, all
their occupants were away at their summer places. The houses were
dark. And Sondra Finchley and Bertine Cranston and all that
company&mdash;what were they doing on a night like this? Where
dancing? Where speeding? Where loving? It was so hard to be poor,
not to have money and position and to be able to do in life exactly
as you wished.</p>

<p>And the next morning, more eager than usual, he was out of Mrs.
Peyton's by six-forty-five, anxious to find some way of renewing
his attentions to Roberta. For there was that crowd of factory
workers that proceeded north along Central Avenue. And she would be
a unit in it, of course, at about 7.10. But his trip to the factory
was fruitless. For, after swallowing a cup of coffee at one of the
small restaurants near the post-office and walking the length of
Central Avenue toward the mill, and pausing at a cigar store to see
if Roberta should by any chance come along alone, he was rewarded
by the sight of her with Grace Marr again. What a wretched, crazy
world this was, he at once decided, and how difficult it was in
this miserable town for anyone to meet anyone else alone. Everyone,
nearly, knew everyone else. Besides, Roberta knew that he was
trying to get a chance to talk to her. Why shouldn't she walk alone
then? He had looked at her enough yesterday. And yet here she was
walking with Grace Marr and appeared seemingly contented. What was
the matter with her anyhow?</p>

<p>By the time he reached the factory he was very sour. But the
sight of Roberta taking her place at her bench and tossing him a
genial "good morning" with a cheerful smile, caused him to feel
better and that all was not lost.</p>

<p>It was three o'clock in the afternoon and a lull due to the
afternoon heat, the fag of steadily continued work, and the flare
of reflected light from the river outside was over all. The tap,
tap, tap of metal stamps upon scores of collars at
once&mdash;nearly always slightly audible above the hum and whirr
of the sewing machines beyond was, if anything, weaker than usual.
And there was Ruza Nikoforitch, Hoda Petkanas, Martha Bordaloue,
Angelina Pitti and Lena Schlict, all joining in a song called
"Sweethearts" which some one had started. And Roberta, perpetually
conscious of Clyde's eyes, as well as his mood, was thinking how
long it would be before he would come around with some word in
regard to something. For she wished him to&mdash;and because of his
whispered words of the day before, she was sure that it would not
be long, because he would not be able to resist it. His eyes the
night before had told her that. Yet because of the impediments of
this situation she knew that he must be having a difficult time
thinking of any way by which he could say anything to her. And
still at certain moments she was glad, for there were such moments
when she felt she needed the security which the presence of so many
girls gave her.</p>

<p>And as she thought of all this, stamping at her desk along with
the others, she suddenly discovered that a bundle of collars which
she had already stamped as sixteens were not of that size but
smaller. She looked at it quickly and nervously, then decided that
there was but one thing to do&mdash;lay the bundle aside and await
comment from one of the foremen, including Clyde, or take it
directly to him now&mdash;really the better way, because it
prevented any of the foremen seeing it before he did. That was what
all the girls did when they made mistakes of any kind. And all
trained girls were supposed to catch all possible errors of that
kind.</p>

<p>And yet now and in the face of all her very urgent desires she
hesitated, for this would take her direct to Clyde and give him the
opportunity he was seeking. But, more terrifying, it was giving her
the opportunity she was seeking. She wavered between loyalty to
Clyde as a superintendent, loyalty to her old conventions as
opposed to her new and dominating desire and her repressed wish to
have Clyde speak to her&mdash;then went over with the bundle and
laid it on his desk. But her hands, as she did so, trembled. Her
face was white&mdash;her throat taut. At the moment, as it chanced,
he was almost vainly trying to calculate the scores of the
different girls from the stubs laid before him, and was having a
hard time of it because his mind was not on what he was doing. And
then he looked up. And there was Roberta bending toward him. His
nerves became very taut, his throat and lips, dry, for here and now
was his opportunity. And, as he could see, Roberta was almost
suffocating from the strain which her daring and self-deception was
putting upon her nerves and heart.</p>

<p>"There's been a distake" (she meant to say mistake) "in regard
to this bundle upstairs," she began. "I didn't notice it either
until I'd stamped nearly all of them. They're fifteen-and-a-half
and I've stamped nearly all of them sixteen. I'm sorry."</p>

<p>Clyde noticed, as she said this, that she was trying to smile a
little and appear calm, but her cheeks were quite blanched and her
hands, particularly the one that held the bundle, trembled. On the
instant he realized that although loyalty and order were bringing
her with this mistake to him, still there was more than that to it.
In a weak, frightened, and yet love-driven way, she was courting
him, giving him the opportunity he was seeking, wishing him to take
advantage of it. And he, embarrassed and shaken for the moment by
this sudden visitation, was still heartened and hardened into a
kind of effrontery and gallantry such as he had not felt as yet in
regard to her. She was seeking him&mdash;that was plain. She was
interested, and clever enough to make the occasion which permitted
him to speak. Wonderful! The sweetness of her daring.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's all right," he said, pretending a courage and a
daring in regard to her which he did not feel even now. "I'll just
send them down to the wash room and then we'll see if we can't
restamp them. It's not our mistake, really."</p>

<p>He smiled most warmly and she met his look with a repressed
smile of her own, already turning and fearing that she had
manifested too clearly what had brought her.</p>

<p>"But don't go," he added quickly. "I want to ask you something.
I've been trying to get a word with you ever since Sunday. I want
you to meet me somewhere, will you? There's a rule here that says a
head of a department can't have anything to do with a girl who
works for him&mdash;outside I mean. But I want you to see me just
the same, won't you? You know," and he smiled winsomely and
coaxingly into her eyes, "I've been just nearly crazy over you ever
since you came in here and Sunday made it worse. And now I'm not
going to let any old rule come between me and you, if I can help
it. Will you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know whether I can do that or not," replied
Roberta, who, now that she had succeeded in accomplishing what she
had wished, was becoming terrorized by her own daring. She began
looking around nervously and feeling that every eye in the room
must be upon her. "I live with Mr. and Mrs. Newton, my friend's
sister and brother-in-law, you know, and they're very strict. It
isn't the same as if&mdash;" She was going to add "I was home," but
Clyde interrupted her.</p>

<p>"Oh, now please don't say no, will you? Please don't. I want to
see you. I don't want to cause you any trouble, that's all.
Otherwise I'd be glad to come round to your house. You know how it
is."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, you mustn't do that," cautioned Roberta. "Not yet
anyhow." She was so confused that quite unconsciously she was
giving Clyde to understand that she was expecting him to come
around some time later.</p>

<p>"Well," smiled Clyde, who could see that she was yielding in
part. "We could just walk out near the end of some street
here&mdash;that street you live in, if you wish. There are no
houses out there. Or there's a little park&mdash;Mohawk&mdash;just
west of Dreamland on the Mohawk Street line. It's right on the
river. You might come out there. I could meet you where the car
stops. Will you do that?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'd be afraid to do that I think&mdash;go so far, I mean. I
never did anything like that before." She looked so innocent and
frank as she said this that Clyde was quite carried away by the
sweetness of her. And to think he was making a clandestine
appointment with her. "I'm almost afraid to go anywhere here alone,
you know. People talk so here, they say, and some one would be sure
to see me. But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, but what?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I'm staying too long at your desk here, don't you
think?" She actually gasped as she said it. And Clyde realizing the
openness of it, although there was really nothing very unusual
about it, now spoke quickly and forcefully.</p>

<p>"Well, then, how about the end of that street you live in?
Couldn't you come down there for just a little while
to-night&mdash;a half hour or so, maybe?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I couldn't make it to-night, I think&mdash;not so soon.
I'll have to see first, you know. Arrange, that is. But another
day." She was so excited and troubled by this great adventure of
hers that her face, like Clyde's at times, changed from a half
smile to a half frown without her realizing that it was registering
these changes.</p>

<p>"Well, then, how about Wednesday night at eight-thirty or nine?
Couldn't you do that? Please, now."</p>

<p>Roberta considered most sweetly, nervously. Clyde was enormously
fascinated by her manner at the moment, for she looked around,
conscious, or so she seemed, that she was being observed and that
her stay here for a first visit was very long.</p>

<p>"I suppose I'd better be going back to my work now," she replied
without really answering him.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute," pled Clyde. "We haven't fixed on the time for
Wednesday. Aren't you going to meet me? Make it nine or
eight-thirty, or any time you want to. I'll be there waiting for
you after eight if you wish. Will you?"</p>

<p>"All right, then, say eight-thirty or between eight-thirty and
nine, if I can. Is that all right? I'll come if I can, you know,
and if anything does happen I'll tell you the next morning, you
see." She flushed and then looked around once more, a foolish,
flustered look, then hurried back to her bench, fairly tingling
from head to toe, and looking as guilty as though she had been
caught red-handed in some dreadful crime. And Clyde at his desk was
almost choking with excitement. The wonder of her agreeing, of his
talking to her like that, of her venturing to make a date with him
at all here in Lycurgus, where he was so well-known! Thrilling!</p>

<p>For her part, she was thinking how wonderful it would be just to
walk and talk with him in the moonlight, to feel the pressure of
his arm and hear his soft appealing voice.</p>

<h3>Chapter 17</h3>

<p>It was quite dark when Roberta stole out on Wednesday night to
meet Clyde. But before that what qualms and meditations in the face
of her willingness and her agreement to do so. For not only was it
difficult for her to overcome her own mental scruples within, but
in addition there was all the trouble in connection with the
commonplace and religious and narrow atmosphere in which she found
herself imbedded at the Newtons'. For since coming here she had
scarcely gone anywhere without Grace Marr. Besides on this
occasion&mdash;a thing she had forgotten in talking to
Clyde&mdash;she had agreed to go with the Newtons and Grace to the
Gideon Baptist Church, where a Wednesday prayer meeting was to be
followed by a social with games, cake, tea and ice cream.</p>

<p>In consequence she was troubled severely as to how to manage,
until it came back to her that a day or two before Mr. Liggett, in
noting how rapid and efficient she was, had observed that at any
time she wanted to learn one phase of the stitching operations
going on in the next room, he would have her taken in hand by Mrs.
Braley, who would teach her. And now that Clyde's invitation and
this church affair fell on the same night, she decided to say that
she had an appointment with Mrs. Braley at her home. Only, as she
also decided, she would wait until just before dinner Wednesday and
then say that Mrs. Braley had invited her to come to her house.
Then she could see Clyde. And by the time the Newtons and Grace
returned she could be back. Oh, how it would feel to have him talk
to her&mdash;say again as he did in the boat that he never had seen
any one look so pretty as she did standing on the bank and looking
for water lilies. Many, many thoughts&mdash;vague, dreadful,
colorful, came to her&mdash;how and where they might
go&mdash;be&mdash;do&mdash;from now on, if only she could arrange
to be friends with him without harm to her or him. If need be, she
now decided, she could resign from the factory and get a place
somewhere else&mdash;a change which would absolve Clyde from any
responsibility in regard to her.</p>

<p>There was, however, another mental as well as emotional phase in
regard to all this and that related to her clothes. For since
coming to Lycurgus she had learned that the more intelligent girls
here dressed better than did those about Biltz and Trippetts Mills.
At the same time she had been sending a fair portion of her money
to her mother&mdash;sufficient to have equipped her exceptionally
well, as she now realized, had she retained it. But now that Clyde
was swaying her so greatly she was troubled about her looks, and on
the evening after her conversation with him at the mill, she had
gone through her small wardrobe, fixing upon a soft blue hat which
Clyde had not yet seen, together with a checkered blue and white
flannel skirt and a pair of white canvas shoes purchased the
previous summer at Biltz. Her plan was to wait until the Newtons
and Grace had departed for church and then swiftly dress and
leave.</p>

<p>At eight-thirty, when night had finally fallen, she went east
along Taylor to Central Avenue, then by a circuitous route made her
way west again to the trysting place. And Clyde was already there.
Against an old wooden fence that enclosed a five-acre cornfield, he
was leaning and looking back toward the interesting little city,
the lights in so many of the homes of which were aglow through the
trees. The air was laden with spices&mdash;the mingled fragrance of
many grasses and flowers. There was a light wind stirring in the
long swords of the corn at his back&mdash;in the leaves of the
trees overhead. And there were stars&mdash;the big dipper and the
little dipper and the milky way&mdash;sidereal phenomena which his
mother had pointed out to him long ago.</p>

<p>And he was thinking how different was his position here to what
it had been in Kansas City. There he had been so nervous in regard
to Hortense Briggs or any girl, really&mdash;afraid almost to say a
word to any of them. Whereas here, and especially since he had had
charge of this stamping room, he had seemed to become aware of the
fact that he was more attractive than he had ever thought he was
before. Also that the girls were attracted to him and that he was
not so much afraid of them. The eyes of Roberta herself showed him
this day how much she was drawn to him. She was his girl. And when
she came, he would put his arms around her and kiss her. And she
would not be able to resist him.</p>

<p>He stood listening, dreaming and watching, the rustling corn
behind him stirring an old recollection in him, when suddenly he
saw her coming. She looked trim and brisk and yet nervous, and
paused at the street end and looked about like a frightened and
cautious animal. At once Clyde hurried forward toward her and
called softly: "Hello. Gee, it's nice to have you meet me. Did you
have any trouble?" He was thinking how much more pleasing she was
than either Hortense Briggs or Rita Dickerman, the one so
calculating, the other so sensually free and indiscriminate.</p>

<p>"Did I have any trouble? Oh, didn't I though?" And at once she
plunged into a full and picturesque account, not only of the
mistake in regard to the Newtons' church night and her engagement
with them, but of a determination on the part of Grace Marr not to
go to the church social without her, and how she had to fib, oh, so
terribly, about going over to Mrs. Braley's to learn to
stitch&mdash;a Liggett-Roberta development of which Clyde had heard
nothing so far and concerning which he was intensely curious,
because at once it raised the thought that already Liggett might be
intending to remove her from under his care. He proceeded to
question her about that before he would let her go on with her
story, an interest which Roberta noticed and because of which she
was very pleased.</p>

<p>"But I can't stay very long, you know," she explained briskly
and warmly at the first opportunity, the while Clyde laid hold of
her arm and turned toward the river, which was to the north and
untenanted this far out. "The Baptist Church socials never last
much beyond ten-thirty or eleven, and they'll be back soon. So I'll
have to manage to be back before they are."</p>

<p>Then she gave many reasons why it would be unwise for her to be
out after ten, reasons which annoyed yet convinced Clyde by their
wisdom. He had been hoping to keep her out longer. But seeing that
the time was to be brief, he was all the keener for a closer
contact with her now, and fell to complimenting her on her pretty
hat and cape and how becoming they were. At once he tried putting
his arm about her waist, but feeling this to be a too swift advance
she removed his arm, or tried to, saying in the softest and most
coaxing voice "Now, now&mdash;that's not nice, is it? Can't you
just hold my arm or let me hold yours?" But he noted, once she
persuaded him to disengage her waist, she took his arm in a
clinging, snuggling embrace and measured her stride to his. On the
instant he was thinking how natural and unaffected her manner was
now that the ice between them had been broken.</p>

<p>And how she went on babbling! She liked Lycurgus, only she
thought it was the most religious town she had ever been
in&mdash;worse than Biltz or Trippetts Mills that way. And then she
had to explain to Clyde what Biltz and Trippetts Mills were
like&mdash;and her home&mdash;a very little, for she did not care
to talk about that. And then back to the Newtons and Grace Marr and
how they watched her every move. Clyde was thinking as she talked
how different she was from Hortense Briggs or Rita, or any other
girl he had ever known&mdash;so much more simple and
confiding&mdash;not in any way mushy as was Rita, or brash or vain
or pretentious, as was Hortense, and yet really as pretty and so
much sweeter. He could not help thinking if she were smartly
dressed how sweet she would be. And again he was wondering what she
would think of him and his attitude toward Hortense in contrast to
his attitude toward her now, if she knew.</p>

<p>"You know," he said at the very first opportunity, "I've been
trying to talk to you ever since you came to work at the factory
but you see how very watchful every one is. They're the limit. They
told me when I came up there that I mustn't interest myself in any
girl working there and so I tried not to. But I just couldn't help
this, could I?" He squeezed her arm affectionately, then stopped
suddenly and, disengaging his arm from hers, put both his about
her. "You know, Roberta, I'm crazy about you. I really am. I think
you're the dearest, sweetest thing. Oh, say! Do you mind my telling
you? Ever since you showed up there, I haven't been able to sleep,
nearly. You've got such nice eyes and hair. To-night you look just
too cute&mdash;lovely, I think. Oh, Roberta," suddenly he caught
her face between his two hands and kissed her, before really she
could evade him. Then having done this he held her while she
resisted him, although it was almost impossible for her to do so.
Instead she felt as though she wanted to put her arms around him or
have him hold her tight, and this mood in regard to him and herself
puzzled and troubled her. It was awful. What would people
think&mdash;say&mdash;if they knew? She was a bad girl, really, and
yet she wanted to be this way&mdash;near him&mdash;now as never
before.</p>

<p>"Oh, you mustn't, Mr. Griffiths," she pleaded. "You really
mustn't, you know. Please. Some one might see us. I think I hear
some one coming. Please, now." She looked about quite frightened,
apparently, while Clyde laughed ecstatically. Life had presented
him a delicious sweet at last. "You know I never did anything like
this before," she went on. "Honest, I didn't. Please. It's only
because you said&mdash;"</p>

<p>Clyde was pressing her close, not saying anything in
reply&mdash;his pale face and dark hungry eyes held very close to
hers. He kissed her again and again despite her protests, her
little mouth and chin and cheeks seeming too beautiful&mdash;too
irresistible&mdash;then murmured pleadingly, for he was too
overcome to speak vigorously.</p>

<p>"Oh, Roberta, dearest, please, please, say that you love me.
Please do! I know that you do, Roberta. I can tell. Please, tell me
now. I'm crazy about you. We have so little time."</p>

<p>He kissed her again upon the cheek and mouth, and suddenly he
felt her relax. She stood quite still and unresisting in his arms.
He felt a wonder of something&mdash;he could not tell what. All of
a sudden he felt tears upon her face, her head sunk to his
shoulder, and then he heard her say: "Yes, yes, yes. I do love you.
Yes, yes. I do. I do."</p>

<p>There was a sob&mdash;half of misery, half of delight&mdash;in
her voice and Clyde caught that. He was so touched by her honesty
and simplicity that tears sprang to his own eyes. "It's all right,
Roberta. It's all right. Please don't cry. Oh, I think you're so
sweet. I do. I do, Roberta."</p>

<p>He looked up and before him in the east over the low roofs of
the city was the thinnest, yellowest topmost arc of the rising July
moon. It seemed at the moment as though life had given him
all&mdash; all&mdash;that he could possibly ask of it.</p>

<h3>Chapter 18</h3>

<p>The culmination of this meeting was but the prelude, as both
Clyde and Roberta realized, to a series of contacts and rejoicings
which were to extend over an indefinite period. They had found
love. They were deliciously happy, whatever the problems attending
its present realization might be. But the ways and means of
continuing with it were a different matter. For not only was her
connection with the Newtons a bar to any normal procedure in so far
as Clyde was concerned, but Grace Marr herself offered a distinct
and separate problem. Far more than Roberta she was chained, not
only by the defect of poor looks, but by the narrow teachings and
domestic training of her early social and religious life. Yet she
wanted to be gay and free, too. And in Roberta, who, while gay and
boastful at times, was still well within the conventions that
chained Grace, she imagined that she saw one who was not so bound.
And so it was that she clung to her closely and as Roberta saw it a
little wearisomely. She imagined that they could exchange ideas and
jests and confidences in regard to the love life and their
respective dreams without injury to each other. And to date this
was her one solace in an otherwise gray world.</p>

<p>But Roberta, even before the arrival of Clyde in her life, did
not want to be so clung to. It was a bore. And afterwards she
developed an inhibition in regard to him where Grace was concerned.
For she not only knew that Grace would resent this sudden
desertion, but also that she had no desire to face out within
herself the sudden and revolutionary moods which now possessed her.
Having at once met and loved him, she was afraid to think what, if
anything, she proposed to permit herself to do in regard to him.
Were not such contacts between the classes banned here? She knew
they were. Hence she did not care to talk about him at all.</p>

<p>In consequence on Monday evening following the Sunday on the
lake when Grace had inquired most gayly and familiarly after Clyde,
Roberta had as instantly decided not to appear nearly as interested
in him as Grace might already be imagining. Accordingly, she said
little other than that he was very pleasant to her and had inquired
after Grace, a remark which caused the latter to eye her slyly and
to wonder if she were really telling what had happened since. "He
was so very friendly I was beginning to think he was struck on
you."</p>

<p>"Oh, what nonsense!" Roberta replied shrewdly, and a bit
alarmed. "Why, he wouldn't look at me. Besides, there's a rule of
the company that doesn't permit him to, as long as I work
there."</p>

<p>This last, more than anything else, served to allay Grace's
notions in regard to Clyde and Roberta, for she was of that
conventional turn of mind which would scarcely permit her to think
of any one infringing upon a company rule. Nevertheless Roberta was
nervous lest Grace should be associating her and Clyde in her mind
in some clandestine way, and she decided to be doubly cautious in
regard to Clyde&mdash;to feign a distance she did not feel.</p>

<p>But all this was preliminary to troubles and strains and fears
which had nothing to do with what had gone before, but took their
rise from difficulties which sprang up immediately afterwards. For
once she had come to this complete emotional understanding with
Clyde, she saw no way of meeting him except in this very
clandestine way and that so very rarely and uncertainly that she
could not say when there was likely to be another meeting.</p>

<p>"You see, it's this way," she explained to Clyde when, a few
evenings later, she had managed to steal out for an hour and they
walked from the region at the end of Taylor Street down to the
Mohawk, where were some open fields and a low bank rising above the
pleasant river. "The Newtons never go any place much without
inviting me. And even if they didn't, Grace'd never go unless I
went along. It's just because we were together so much in Trippetts
Mills that she feels that way, as though I were a part of the
family. But now it's different, and yet I don't see how I am going
to get out of it so soon. I don't know where to say I'm going or
whom I am going with."</p>

<p>"I know that, honey," he replied softly and sweetly. "That's all
true enough. But how is that going to help us now? You can't expect
me to get along with just looking at you in the factory, either,
can you?"</p>

<p>He gazed at her so solemnly and yearningly that she was moved by
her sympathy for him, and in order to assuage his depression added:
"No, I don't want you to do that, dear. You know I don't. But what
am I to do?" She laid a soft and pleading hand on the back of one
of Clyde's thin, long and nervous ones.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what, though," she went on after a period of
reflection, "I have a sister living in Homer, New York. That's
about thirty-five miles north of here. I might say I was going up
there some Saturday afternoon or Sunday. She's been writing me to
come up, but I hadn't thought of it before. But I might
go&mdash;that is&mdash;I might&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, why not do that?" exclaimed Clyde eagerly. "That's fine! A
good idea!"</p>

<p>"Let me see," she added, ignoring his exclamation. "If I
remember right you have to go to Fonda first, then change cars
there. But I could leave here any time on the trolley and there are
only two trains a day from Fonda, one at two, and one at seven on
Saturday. So I might leave here any time before two, you see, and
then if I didn't make the two o'clock train, it would be all right,
wouldn't it? I could go on the seven. And you could be over there,
or meet me on the way, just so no one here saw us. Then I could go
on and you could come back. I could arrange that with Agnes, I'm
sure. I would have to write her."</p>

<p>"How about all the time between then and now, though?" he
queried peevishly. "It's a long time till then, you know."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll have to see what I can think of, but I'm not sure,
dear. I'll have to see. And you think too. But I ought to be going
back now," she added nervously. She at once arose, causing Clyde to
rise, too, and consult his watch, thereby discovering that it was
already near ten.</p>

<p>"But what about us!" he continued persistently. "Why couldn't
you pretend next Sunday that you're going to some other church than
yours and meet me somewhere instead? Would they have to know?"</p>

<p>At once Clyde noted Roberta's face darken slightly, for here he
was encroaching upon something that was still too closely
identified with her early youth and convictions to permit
infringement.</p>

<p>"Hump, uh," she replied quite solemnly. "I wouldn't want to do
that. I wouldn't feel right about it. And it wouldn't be right,
either."</p>

<p>Immediately Clyde sensed that he was treading on dangerous
ground and withdrew the suggestion because he did not care to
offend or frighten her in any way. "Oh, well. Just as you say. I
only thought since you don't seem to be able to think of any other
way."</p>

<p>"No, no, dear," she pleaded softly, because she noted that he
felt that she might be offended. "It's all right, only I wouldn't
want to do that. I couldn't."</p>

<p>Clyde shook his head. A recollection of his own youthful
inhibitions caused him to feel that perhaps it was not right for
him to have suggested it.</p>

<p>They returned in the direction of Taylor Street without, apart
from the proposed trip to Fonda, either having hit upon any
definite solution. Instead, after kissing her again and again and
just before letting her go, the best he could suggest was that both
were to try and think of some way by which they could meet before,
if possible. And she, after throwing her arms about his neck for a
moment, ran east along Taylor Street, her little figure swaying in
the moonlight.</p>

<p>However, apart from another evening meeting which was made
possible by Roberta's announcing a second engagement with Mrs.
Braley, there was no other encounter until the following Saturday
when Roberta departed for Fonda. And Clyde, having ascertained the
exact hour, left by the car ahead, and joined Roberta at the first
station west. From that point on until evening, when she was
compelled to take the seven o'clock train, they were unspeakably
happy together, loitering near the little city comparatively
strange to both.</p>

<p>For outside of Fonda a few miles they came to a pleasure park
called Starlight where, in addition to a few clap-trap pleasure
concessions such as a ring of captive aeroplanes, a Ferris wheel, a
merry-go-round, an old mill and a dance floor, was a small lake
with boats. It was after its fashion an idyllic spot with a little
band-stand out on an island near the center of the lake and on the
shore a grave and captive bear in a cage. Since coming to Lycurgus
Roberta had not ventured to visit any of the rougher resorts near
there, which were very much like this, only much more strident. On
sight of this both exclaimed: "Oh, look!" And Clyde added at once:
"Let's get off here, will you&mdash;shall we? What do you say?
We're almost to Fonda anyhow. And we can have more fun here."</p>

<p>At once they climbed down. And having disposed of her bag for
the time being, he led the way first to the stand of a man who sold
frankfurters. Then, since the merry-go-round was in full blast,
nothing would do but that Roberta should ride with him. And in the
gayest of moods, they climbed on, and he placed her on a zebra, and
then stood close in order that he might keep his arm about her, and
both try to catch the brass ring. And as commonplace and noisy and
gaudy as it all was, the fact that at last he had her all to
himself unseen, and she him, was sufficient to evoke in both a kind
of ecstasy which was all out of proportion to the fragile, gimcrack
scene. Round and round they spun on the noisy, grinding machine,
surveying now a few idle pleasure seekers who were in boats upon
the lake, now some who were flying round in the gaudy green and
white captive aeroplanes or turning upward and then down in the
suspended cages of the Ferris wheel.</p>

<p>Both looked at the woods and sky beyond the lake; the idlers and
dancers in the dancing pavilion dreaming and thrilling, and then
suddenly Clyde asked: "You dance, don't you, Roberta?"</p>

<p>"Why, no, I don't," she replied, a little sadly, for at the very
moment she had been looking at the happy dancers rather ruefully
and thinking how unfortunate it was that she had never been allowed
to dance. It might not be right or nice, perhaps&mdash;her own
church said it was not&mdash;but still, now that they were here and
in love like this&mdash;these others looked so gay and
happy&mdash;a pretty medley of colors moving round and round in the
green and brown frame&mdash;it did not seem so bad to her. Why
shouldn't people dance, anyway? Girls like herself and boys like
Clyde? Her younger brother and sister, in spite of the views of her
parents, were already declaring that when the opportunity offered,
they were going to learn.</p>

<p>"Oh, isn't that too bad!" he exclaimed, thinking how delightful
it would be to hold Roberta in his arms. "We could have such fun
now if you could. I could teach you in a few minutes if you wanted
me to."</p>

<p>"I don't know about that," she replied quizzically, her eyes
showing that his suggestion appealed to her. "I'm not so clever
that way. And you know dancing isn't considered so very nice in my
part of the country. And my church doesn't approve of it, either.
And I know my parents wouldn't like me to."</p>

<p>"Oh, shucks," replied Clyde foolishly and gayly, "what nonsense,
Roberta. Why, everybody dances these days or nearly everybody. How
can you think there's anything wrong with it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I know," replied Roberta oddly and quaintly, "maybe they do
in your set. I know most of those factory girls do, of course. And
I suppose where you have money and position, everything's right.
But with a girl like me, it's different. I don't suppose your
parents were as strict as mine, either."</p>

<p>"Oh, weren't they, though?" laughed Clyde who had not failed to
catch the "your set"; also the "where you have money and
position."</p>

<p>"Well, that's all you know about it," he went on. "They were as
strict as yours and stricter, I'll bet. But I danced just the same.
Why, there's no harm in it, Roberta. Come on, let me teach you.
It's wonderful, really. Won't you, dearest?"</p>

<p>He put his arm around her and looked into her eyes and she half
relented, quite weakened by her desire for him.</p>

<p>Just then the merry-go-round stopped and without any plan or
suggestion they seemed instinctively to drift to the side of the
pavilion where the dancers&mdash;not many but avid&mdash;were
moving briskly around. Fox-trots and one-steps were being supplied
by an orchestrelle of considerable size. At a turnstile, all the
remaining portions of the pavilion being screened in, a pretty
concessionaire was sitting and taking tickets&mdash;ten cents per
dance per couple. But the color and the music and the motions of
the dancers gliding rhythmically here and there quite seized upon
both Clyde and Roberta.</p>

<p>The orchestrelle stopped and the dancers were coming out. But no
sooner were they out than five-cent admission checks were once more
sold for the new dance.</p>

<p>"I don't believe I can," pleaded Roberta, as Clyde led her to
the ticket-stile. "I'm afraid I'm too awkward, maybe. I never
danced, you know."</p>

<p>"You awkward, Roberta," he exclaimed. "Oh, how crazy. Why,
you're as graceful and pretty as you can be. You'll see. You'll be
a wonderful dancer."</p>

<p>Already he had paid the coin and they were inside.</p>

<p>Carried away by a bravado which was three-fourths her conception
of him as a member of the Lycurgus upper crust and possessor of
means and position, he led the way into a corner and began at once
to illustrate the respective movements. They were not difficult and
for a girl of Roberta's natural grace and zest, easy. Once the
music started and Clyde drew her to him, she fell into the
positions and steps without effort, and they moved rhythmically and
instinctively together. It was the delightful sensation of being
held by him and guided here and there that so appealed to
her&mdash;the wonderful rhythm of his body coinciding with
hers.</p>

<p>"Oh, you darling," he whispered. "Aren't you the dandy little
dancer, though. You've caught on already. If you aren't the
wonderful kid. I can hardly believe it."</p>

<p>They went about the floor once more, then a third time, before
the music stopped and by the time it did, Roberta was lost in a
sense of delight such as had never come to her before. To think she
had been dancing! And it should be so wonderful! And with Clyde! He
was so slim, graceful&mdash;quite the handsomest of any of the
young men on the floor, she thought. And he, in turn, was now
thinking that never had he known any one as sweet as Roberta. She
was so gay and winsome and yielding. She would not try to work him
for anything. And as for Sondra Finchley, well, she had ignored him
and he might as well dismiss her from his mind&mdash;and yet even
here, and with Roberta, he could not quite forget her.</p>

<p>At five-thirty when the orchestrelle was silenced for lack of
customers and a sign reading "Next Concert 7.30" hung up, they were
still dancing. After that they went for an ice-cream soda, then for
something to eat, and by then, so swiftly had sped the time, it was
necessary to take the very next car for the depot at Fonda.</p>

<p>As they neared this terminal, both Clyde and Roberta were full
of schemes as to how they were to arrange for to-morrow. For
Roberta would be coming back then and if she could arrange to leave
her sister's a little early Sunday he could come over from Lycurgus
to meet her. They could linger around Fonda until eleven at least,
when the last train south from Homer was due. And pretending she
had arrived on that they could then, assuming there was no one whom
they knew on the Lycurgus car, journey to that city.</p>

<p>And as arranged so they met. And in the dark outlying streets of
that city, walked and talked and planned, and Roberta told Clyde
something&mdash;though not much&mdash;of her home life at
Biltz.</p>

<p>But the great thing, apart from their love for each other and
its immediate expression in kisses and embraces, was the how and
where of further contacts. They must find some way, only, really,
as Roberta saw it, she must be the one to find the way, and that
soon. For while Clyde was obviously very impatient and eager to be
with her as much as possible, still he did not appear to be very
ready with suggestions&mdash;available ones.</p>

<p>But that, as she also saw, was not easy. For the possibility of
another visit to her sister in Homer or her parents in Biltz was
not even to be considered under a month. And apart from them what
other excuses were there? New friends at the factory&mdash;the
post-office&mdash;the library&mdash;the Y. W. C. A.&mdash;all
suggestions of Clyde's at the moment. But these spelled but an hour
or two together at best, and Clyde was thinking of other week-ends
like this. And there were so few remaining summer week-ends.</p>

<h3>Chapter 19</h3>

<p>The return of Roberta and Clyde, as well as their outing
together, was quite unobserved, as they thought. On the car from
Fonda they recognized no one. And at the Newtons' Grace was already
in bed. She merely awakened sufficiently to ask a few questions
about the trip&mdash;and those were casual and indifferent. How was
Roberta's sister? Had she stayed all day in Homer or had she gone
to Biltz or Trippetts Mills? (Roberta explained that she had
remained at her sister's.) She herself must be going up pretty soon
to see her parents at Trippetts Mills. Then she fell asleep.</p>

<p>But at dinner the next night the Misses Opal Feliss and Olive
Pope, who had been kept from the breakfast table by a too late
return from Fonda and the very region in which Roberta had spent
Saturday afternoon, now seated themselves and at once, as Roberta
entered, interjected a few genial and well-meant but, in so far as
Roberta was concerned, decidedly troubling observations.</p>

<p>"Oh, there you are! Look who's back from Starlight Park. Howja
like the dancing over there, Miss Alden? We saw you, but you didn't
see us." And before Roberta had time to think what to reply, Miss
Feliss had added: "We tried to get your eye, but you couldn't see
any one but him, I guess. I'll say you dance swell."</p>

<p>At once Roberta, who had never been on very intimate terms with
either of these girls and who had neither the effrontery nor the
wit to extricate herself from so swift and complete and so
unexpected an exposure, flushed. She was all but speechless and
merely stared, bethinking her at once that she had explained to
Grace that she was at her sister's all day. And opposite sat Grace,
looking directly at her, her lips slightly parted as though she
would exclaim: "Well, of all things! And dancing! A man!" And at
the head of the table, George Newton, thin and meticulous and
curious, his sharp eyes and nose and pointed chin now turned in her
direction.</p>

<p>But on the instant, realizing that she must say something,
Roberta replied: "Oh, yes, that's so. I did go over there for a
little while. Some friends of my sister's were coming over and I
went with them." She was about to add, "We didn't stay very long,"
but stopped herself. For at that moment a certain fighting quality
which she had inherited from her mother, and which had asserted
itself in the case of Grace before this, now came to her rescue.
After all, why shouldn't she be at Starlight Park if she chose? And
what right had the Newtons or Grace or anyone else to question her
for that matter? She was paying her way. Nevertheless, as she
realized, she had been caught in a deliberate lie and all because
she lived here and was constantly being questioned and looked after
in regard to her very least move. Miss Pope added curiously, "I
don't suppose he's a Lycurgus boy. I don't remember ever seeing him
around here."</p>

<p>"No, he isn't from here," returned Roberta shortly and coldly,
for by now she was fairly quivering with the realization that she
had been caught in a falsehood before Grace. Also that Grace would
resent intensely this social secrecy and desertion of her. At once
she felt as though she would like to get up from the table and
leave and never return. But instead she did her best to compose
herself, and now gave the two girls with whom she had never been
familiar, a steady look. At the same time she looked at Grace and
Mr. Newton with defiance. If anything more were said she proposed
to give a fictitious name or two&mdash;friends of her
brother-in-law in Homer, or better yet to refuse to give any
information whatsoever. Why should she?</p>

<p>Nevertheless, as she learned later that evening, she was not to
be spared the refusing of it. Grace, coming to their room
immediately afterward, reproached her with: "I thought you said you
stayed out at your sister's all the time you were gone?"</p>

<p>"Well, what if I did say it?" replied Roberta defiantly and even
bitterly, but without a word in extenuation, for her thought was
now that unquestionably Grace was pretending to catechize her on
moral grounds, whereas in reality the real source of her anger and
pique was that Roberta was slipping away from and hence neglecting
her.</p>

<p>"Well, you don't have to lie to me in order to go anywhere or
see anybody without me in the future. I don't want to go with you.
And what's more I don't want to know where you go or who you go
with. But I do wish you wouldn't tell me one thing and then have
George and Mary find out that it ain't so, and that you're just
trying to slip away from me or that I'm lying to them in order to
protect myself. I don't want you to put me in that position."</p>

<p>She was very hurt and sad and contentious and Roberta could see
for herself that there was no way out of this trying situation
other than to move. Grace was a leech&mdash;a hanger-on. She had no
life of her own and could contrive none. As long as she was
anywhere near her she would want to devote herself to her&mdash;to
share her every thought and mood with her. And yet if she told her
about Clyde she would be shocked and critical and would
unquestionably eventually turn on her or even expose her. So she
merely replied: "Oh, well, have it that way if you want to. I don't
care. I don't propose to tell anything unless I choose to."</p>

<p>And at once Grace conceived the notion that Roberta did not like
her any more and would have nothing to do with her. She arose
immediately and walked out of the room&mdash;her head very high and
her spine very stiff. And Roberta, realizing that she had made an
enemy of her, now wished that she was out of here. They were all
too narrow here anyway. They would never understand or tolerate
this clandestine relationship with Clyde&mdash;so necessary to him
apparently, as he had explained&mdash;so troublesome and even
disgraceful to her from one point of view, and yet so precious. She
did love him, so very, very much. And she must now find some way to
protect herself and him&mdash;move to another room.</p>

<p>But that in this instance required almost more courage and
decision than she could muster. The anomalous and unprotected
nature of a room where one was not known. The look of it.
Subsequent explanation to her mother and sister maybe. Yet to
remain here after this was all but impossible, too, for the
attitude of Grace as well as the Newtons&mdash;particularly Mrs.
Newton, Grace's sister&mdash; was that of the early Puritans or
Friends who had caught a "brother" or "sister" in a great sin. She
was dancing&mdash;and secretly! There was the presence of that
young man not quite adequately explained by her trip home, to say
nothing of her presence at Starlight Park. Besides, in Roberta's
mind was the thought that under such definite espionage as must now
follow, to say nothing of the unhappy and dictatorial attitude of
Grace, she would have small chance to be with Clyde as much as she
now most intensely desired. And accordingly, after two days of
unhappy thought and then a conference with Clyde who was all for
her immediate independence in a new room where she would not be
known or spied upon, she proceeded to take an hour or two off; and
having fixed upon the southeast section of the city as one most
likely to be free from contact with either the Newtons or those
whom thus far she had encountered at the Newtons', she inquired
there, and after little more than an hour's search found one place
which pleased her. This was in an old brick house in Elm Street
occupied by an upholsterer and his wife and two daughters, one a
local milliner and another still in school. The room offered was on
the ground floor to the right of a small front porch and
overlooking the street. A door off this same porch gave into a
living room which separated this room from the other parts of the
house and permitted ingress and egress without contact with any
other portion of the house. And since she was still moved to meet
Clyde clandestinely this as she now saw was important.</p>

<p>Besides, as she gathered from her one conversation with Mrs.
Gilpin, the mother of this family, the character of this home was
neither so strict nor inquisitive as that of the Newtons. Mrs.
Gilpin was large, passive, cleanly, not so very alert and about
fifty. She informed Roberta that as a rule she didn't care to take
boarders or roomers at all, since the family had sufficient means
to go on. However, since the family scarcely ever used the front
room, which was rather set off from the remainder of the house, and
since her husband did not object, she had made up her mind to rent
it. And again she preferred some one who worked like
Roberta&mdash;a girl, not a man&mdash;and one who would be glad to
have her breakfast and dinner along with her family. Since she
asked no questions as to her family or connections, merely looking
at her interestedly and seeming to be favorably impressed by her
appearance, Roberta gathered that here were no such standards as
prevailed at the Newtons.</p>

<p>And yet what qualms in connection with the thought of moving
thus. For about this entire clandestine procedure there hung, as
she saw it, a sense of something untoward and even sinful, and then
on top of it all, quarreling and then breaking with Grace Marr, her
one girl friend here thus far, and the Newtons on account of it,
when, as she well knew, it was entirely due to Grace that she was
here at all. Supposing her parents or her sister in Homer should
hear about this through some one whom Grace knew and think
strangely of her going off by herself in Lycurgus in this way? Was
it right? Was it possible that she could do things like
this&mdash;and so soon after her coming here? She was beginning to
feel as though her hitherto impeccable standards were
crumbling.</p>

<p>And yet there was Clyde now. Could she give him up?</p>

<p>After many emotional aches she decided that she could not. And
accordingly after paying a deposit and arranging to occupy the room
within the next few days, she returned to her work and after dinner
the same evening announced to Mrs. Newton that she was going to
move. Her premeditated explanation was that recently she had been
thinking of having her younger brother and sister come and live
with her and since one or both were likely to come soon, she
thought it best to prepare for them.</p>

<p>And the Newtons, as well as Grace, feeling that this was all due
to the new connections which Roberta had recently been making and
which were tending to alienate her from Grace, were now content to
see her go. Plainly she was beginning to indulge in a type of
adventure of which they could not approve. Also it was plain that
she was not going to prove as useful to Grace as they had at first
imagined. Possibly she knew what she was doing. But more likely she
was being led astray by notions of a good time not consistent with
the reserved life led by her at Trippetts Mills.</p>

<p>And Roberta herself, once having made this move and settled
herself in this new atmosphere (apart from the fact that it gave
her much greater freedom in connection with Clyde) was dubious as
to her present course. Perhaps&mdash;perhaps&mdash;she had moved
hastily and in anger and might be sorry. Still she had done it now,
and it could not be helped. So she proposed to try it for a
while.</p>

<p>To salve her own conscience more than anything else, she at once
wrote her mother and her sister a very plausible version of why she
had been compelled to leave the Newtons. Grace had grown too
possessive, domineering and selfish. It had become unendurable.
However, her mother need not worry. She was satisfactorily placed.
She had a room to herself and could now entertain Tom and Emily or
her mother or Agnes, in case they should ever visit her here. And
she would be able to introduce them to the Gilpins whom she
proceeded to describe.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, her underlying thought in connection with all
this, in so far as Clyde and his great passion for her was
concerned&mdash; and hers for him&mdash;was that she was indeed
trifling with fire and perhaps social disgrace into the bargain.
For, although consciously at this time she was scarcely willing to
face the fact that this room&mdash;its geometric position in
relation to the rest of the house&mdash; had been of the greatest
import to her at the time she first saw it, yet subconsciously she
knew it well enough. The course she was pursuing was
dangerous&mdash;that she knew. And yet how, as she now so often
asked herself at moments when she was confronted by some desire
which ran counter to her sense of practicability and social
morality, was she to do?</p>

<h3>Chapter 20</h3>

<p>However, as both Roberta and Clyde soon found, after several
weeks in which they met here and there, such spots as could be
conveniently reached by interurban lines, there were still
drawbacks and the principal of these related to the attitude of
both Roberta and Clyde in regard to this room, and what, if any,
use of it was to be made by them jointly. For in spite of the fact
that thus far Clyde had never openly agreed with himself that his
intentions in relation to Roberta were in any way different to
those normally entertained by any youth toward any girl for whom he
had a conventional social regard, still, now that she had moved
into this room, there was that ineradicable and possibly
censurable, yet very human and almost unescapable, desire for
something more&mdash;the possibility of greater and greater
intimacy with and control of Roberta and her thoughts and actions
in everything so that in the end she would be entirely his. But how
<i>his</i>? By way of marriage and the ordinary conventional and
durable existence which thereafter must ordinarily ensue? He had
never said so to himself thus far. For in flirting with her or any
girl of a lesser social position than that of the Griffiths here
(Sondra Finchley, Bertine Cranston, for instance) he would
not&mdash;and that largely due to the attitude of his newly-found
relatives, their very high position in this city&mdash;have deemed
marriage advisable. And what would they think if they should come
to know? For socially, as he saw himself now, if not before coming
here, he was supposed to be above the type of Roberta and should of
course profit by that notion. Besides there were all those that
knew him here, at least to speak to. On the other hand, because of
the very marked pull that her temperament had for him, he had not
been able to say for the time being that she was not worthy of him
or that he might not be happy in case it were possible or advisable
for him to marry her.</p>

<p>And there was another thing now that tended to complicate
matters. And that was that fall with its chilling winds and frosty
nights was drawing near. Already it was near October first and most
of those out-of-door resorts which, up to the middle of September
at least, had provided diversion, and that at a fairly safe
distance from Lycurgus, were already closed for the season. And
dancing, except in the halls of the near-by cities and which,
because of a mood of hers in regard to them, were unacceptable, was
also for the time being done away with. As for the churches, moving
pictures, and restaurants of Lycurgus, how under the circumstances,
owing to Clyde's position here, could they be seen in them? They
could not, as both reasoned between them. And so now, while her
movements were unrestrained, there was no place to go unless by
some readjustment of their relations he might be permitted to call
on her at the Gilpins'. But that, as he knew, she would not think
of and, at first, neither had he the courage to suggest it.</p>

<p>However they were at a street-end one early October night about
six weeks after she had moved to her new room. The stars were
sharp. The air cool. The leaves were beginning to turn. Roberta had
returned to a three-quarter green-and-cream-striped winter coat
that she wore at this season of the year. Her hat was brown,
trimmed with brown leather and of a design that became her. There
had been kisses over and over&mdash;that same fever that had been
dominating them continuously since first they met&mdash;only more
pronounced if anything.</p>

<p>"It's getting cold, isn't it?" It was Clyde who spoke. And it
was eleven o'clock and chill.</p>

<p>"Yes, I should say it is. I'll soon have to get a heavier
coat."</p>

<p>"I don't see how we are to do from now on, do you? There's no
place to go any more much, and it won't be very pleasant walking
the streets this way every night. You don't suppose we could fix it
so I could call on you at the Gilpins' once in a while, do you? It
isn't the same there now as it was at the Newtons'."</p>

<p>"Oh, I know, but then they use their sitting room every night
nearly until ten-thirty or eleven. And besides their two girls are
in and out all hours up to twelve, anyhow, and they're in there
often. I don't see how I can. Besides, I thought you said you
didn't want to have any one see you with me that way, and if you
came there I couldn't help introducing you."</p>

<p>"Oh, but I don't mean just that way," replied Clyde audaciously
and yet with the feeling that Roberta was much too squeamish and
that it was high time she was taking a somewhat more liberal
attitude toward him if she cared for him as much as she appeared
to: "Why wouldn't it be all right for me to stop in for a little
while? They wouldn't need to know, would they?" He took out his
watch and discovered with the aid of a match that it was
eleven-thirty. He showed the time to her. "There wouldn't be
anybody there now, would there?"</p>

<p>She shook her head in opposition. The thought not only terrified
but sickened her. Clyde was getting very bold to even suggest
anything like that. Besides this suggestion embodied in itself all
the secret fears and compelling moods which hitherto, although
actual in herself, she was still unwilling to face. There was
something sinful, low, dreadful about it. She would not. That was
one thing sure. At the same time within her was that overmastering
urge of repressed and feared desire now knocking loudly for
recognition.</p>

<p>"No, no, I can't let you do that. It wouldn't be right. I don't
want to. Some one might see us. Somebody might know you." For the
moment the moral repulsion was so great that unconsciously she
endeavored to relinquish herself from his embrace.</p>

<p>Clyde sensed how deep was this sudden revolt. All the more was
he flagellated by the desire for possession of that which now he
half feared to be unobtainable. A dozen seductive excuses sprang to
his lips. "Oh, who would be likely to see us anyhow, at this time
of night? There isn't any one around. Why shouldn't we go there for
a few moments if we want to? No one would be likely to hear us. We
needn't talk so loud. There isn't any one on the street, even.
Let's walk by the house and see if anybody is up."</p>

<p>Since hitherto she had not permitted him to come within half a
block of the house, her protest was not only nervous but vigorous.
Nevertheless on this occasion Clyde was proving a little rebellious
and Roberta, standing somewhat in awe of him as her superior, as
well as her lover, was unable to prevent their walking within a few
feet of the house where they stopped. Except for a barking dog
there was not a sound to be heard anywhere. And in the house no
light was visible.</p>

<p>"See, there's no one up," protested Clyde reassuringly. "Why
shouldn't we go in for a little while if we want to? Who will know?
We needn't make any noise. Besides, what is wrong with it? Other
people do it. It isn't such a terrible thing for a girl to take a
fellow to her room if she wants to for a little while."</p>

<p>"Oh, isn't it? Well, maybe not in your set. But I know what's
right and I don't think that's right and I won't do it."</p>

<p>At once, as she said this, Roberta's heart gave a pained and
weakening throb, for in saying so much she had exhibited more
individuality and defiance than ever he had seen or that she
fancied herself capable of in connection with him. It terrified her
not a little. Perhaps he would not like her so much now if she were
going to talk like that.</p>

<p>His mood darkened immediately. Why did she want to act so? She
was too cautious, too afraid of anything that spelled a little life
or pleasure. Other girls were not like that,&mdash;Rita, those
girls at the factory. She pretended to love him. She did not object
to his holding her in his arms and kissing her under a tree at the
end of the street. But when it came to anything slightly more
private or intimate, she could not bring herself to agree. What
kind of a girl was she, anyhow? What was the use of pursuing her?
Was this to be another case of Hortense Briggs with all her wiles
and evasions? Of course Roberta was in no wise like her, but still
she was so stubborn.</p>

<p>Although she could not see his face she knew he was angry and
quite for the first time in this way.</p>

<p>"All right, then, if you don't want to, you don't have to," came
his words and with decidedly a cold ring to them. "There are others
places I can go. I notice you never want to do anything I want to
do, though. I'd like to know how you think we're to do. We can't
walk the streets every night." His tone was gloomy and
foreboding&mdash;more contentious and bitter than at any time ever
between them. And his references to other places shocked and
frightened Roberta&mdash;so much so that instantly almost her own
mood changed. Those other girls in his own world that no doubt he
saw from time to time! Those other girls at the factory who were
always trying to make eyes at him! She had seen them trying, and
often. That Ruza Nikoforitch&mdash;as coarse as she was, but
pretty, too. And that Flora Brandt! And Martha Bordaloue&mdash;ugh!
To think that any one as nice as he should be pursued by such
wretches as those. However, because of that, she was fearful lest
he would think her too difficult&mdash;some one without the
experience or daring to which he, in his superior world, was
accustomed, and so turn to one of those. Then she would lose him.
The thought terrified her. Immediately from one of defiance her
attitude changed to one of pleading persuasion.</p>

<p>"Oh, please, Clyde, don't be mad with me now, will you? You know
that I would if I could. I can't do anything like that here. Can't
you see? You know that. Why, they'd be sure to find out. And how
would you feel if some one were to see us or recognize you?" In a
pleading way she put one hand on his arm, then about his waist and
he could feel that in spite of her sharp opposition the moment
before, she was very much concerned&mdash;painfully so. "Please
don't ask me to," she added in a begging tone.</p>

<p>"Well, what did you want to leave the Newtons for then?" he
asked sullenly. "I can't see where else we can go now if you won't
let me come to see you once in a while. We can't go any place
else."</p>

<p>The thought gave Roberta pause. Plainly this relationship was
not to be held within conventional lines. At the same time she did
not see how she could possibly comply. It was too
unconventional&mdash;too unmoral&mdash;bad.</p>

<p>"I thought we took it," she said weakly and placatively, "just
so that we could go places on Saturday and Sunday."</p>

<p>"But where can we go Saturday and Sunday now? Everything's
closed."</p>

<p>Again Roberta was checked by these unanswerable complexities
which beleaguered them both and she exclaimed futilely, "Oh, I wish
I knew what to do."</p>

<p>"Oh, it would be easy enough if you wanted to do it, but that's
always the way with you, you don't want to."</p>

<p>She stood there, the night wind shaking the drying whispering
leaves. Distinctly the problem in connection with him that she had
been fearing this long while was upon her. Could she possibly, with
all the right instruction that she had had, now do as he suggested.
She was pulled and swayed by contending forces within herself,
strong and urgent in either case. In the one instance, however
painful it was to her moral and social mood, she was moved to
comply&mdash;in another to reject once and for all, any such, as
she saw it, bold and unnatural suggestion. Nevertheless, in spite
of the latter and because of her compelling affection she could not
do other than deal tenderly and pleadingly with him.</p>

<p>"I can't, Clyde, I can't. I would if I could but I can't. It
wouldn't be right. I would if I could make myself, but I can't."
She looked up into his face, a pale oval in the dark, trying to see
if he would not see, sympathize, be moved in her favor. However,
irritated by this plainly definite refusal, he was not now to be
moved. All this, as he saw it, smacked of that long series of
defeats which had accompanied his attentions to Hortense Briggs. He
was not going to stand for anything now like that, you bet. If this
was the way she was going to act, well let her act so&mdash;but not
with him. He could get plenty of girls now&mdash;lots of
them&mdash;who would treat him better than this.</p>

<p>At once, and with an irritated shrug of the shoulders, as she
now saw, he turned and started to leave her, saying as he did so,
"Oh, that's all right, if that's the way you feel about it." And
Roberta dumfounded and terrified, stood there.</p>

<p>"Please don't, go, Clyde. Please don't leave me," she exclaimed
suddenly and pathetically, her defiance and courage undergoing a
deep and sad change. "I don't want you to. I love you so, Clyde. I
would if I could. You know that."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I know, but you needn't tell me that" (it was his
experience with Hortense and Rita that was prompting him to this
attitude). With a twist he released his body from her arm and
started walking briskly down the street in the dark.</p>

<p>And Roberta, stricken by this sudden development which was so
painful to both, called, "Clyde!" And then ran after him a little
way, eager that he should pause and let her plead with him more.
But he did not return. Instead he went briskly on. And for the
moment it was all she could do to keep from following him and by
sheer force, if need be, restrain him. Her Clyde! And she started
running in his direction a little, but as suddenly stopped, checked
for the moment by the begging, pleading, compromising attitude in
which she, for the first time, found herself. For on the one hand
all her conventional training was now urging her to stand
firm&mdash;not to belittle herself in this way&mdash;whereas on the
other, all her desires for love, understanding, companionship,
urged her to run after him before it was too late, and he was gone.
His beautiful face, his beautiful hands. His eyes. And still the
receding echo of his feet. And yet so binding were the conventions
which had been urged upon her up to this time that, though
suffering horribly, a balance between the two forces was struck,
and she paused, feeling that she could neither go forward nor stand
still&mdash; understand or endure this sudden rift in their
wonderful friendship.</p>

<p>Pain constricted her heart and whitened her lips. She stood
there numb and silent&mdash;unable to voice anything, even the name
Clyde which persistently arose as a call in her throat. Instead she
was merely thinking, "Oh, Clyde, please don't go, Clyde. Oh, please
don't go." And he was already out of hearing, walking briskly and
grimly on, the click and echo of his receding steps falling less
and less clearly on her suffering ears.</p>

<p>It was the first flashing, blinding, bleeding stab of love for
her.</p>

<h3>Chapter 21</h3>

<p>The state of Roberta's mind for that night is not easily to be
described. For here was true and poignant love, and in youth true
and poignant love is difficult to withstand. Besides it was coupled
with the most stirring and grandiose illusions in regard to Clyde's
local material and social condition&mdash;illusions which had
little to do with anything he had done to build up, but were based
rather on conjecture and gossip over which he had no control. And
her own home, as well as her personal situation was so
unfortunate&mdash; no promise of any kind save in his direction.
And here she was quarreling with him&mdash;sending him away angry.
On the other hand was he not beginning to push too ardently toward
those troublesome and no doubt dreadful liberties and familiarities
which her morally trained conscience would not permit her to look
upon as right? How was she to do now? What to say?</p>

<p>Now it was that she said to herself in the dark of her room,
after having slowly and thoughtfully undressed and noiselessly
crept into the large, old-fashioned bed. "No, I won't do that. I
mustn't. I can't. I will be a bad girl if I do. I should not do
that for him even though he does want me to, and should threaten to
leave me forever in case I refuse. He should be ashamed to ask me."
And at the very same moment, or the next, she would be asking
herself what else under the circumstances they were to do. For most
certainly Clyde was at least partially correct in his contention
that they had scarcely anywhere else they could go and not be
recognized. How unfair was that rule of the company. And no doubt
apart from that rule, the Griffiths would think it beneath him to
be troubling with her, as would no doubt the Newtons and the
Gilpins for that matter, if they should hear and know who he was.
And if this information came to their knowledge it would injure him
and her. And she would not do anything that would injure
him&mdash;never.</p>

<p>One thing that occurred to her at this point was that she should
get a place somewhere else so that this problem should be
solved&mdash; a problem which at the moment seemed to have little
to do with the more immediate and intimate one of desiring to enter
her room. But that would mean that she would not see him any more
all day long&mdash; only at night. And then not every night by any
means. And that caused her to lay aside this thought of seeking
another place.</p>

<p>At the same time as she now meditated the dawn would come
to-morrow and there would be Clyde at the factory. And supposing
that he should not speak to her nor she to him. Impossible!
Ridiculous! Terrible! The mere thought brought her to a sitting
posture in bed, where distractedly a vision of Clyde looking
indifferently and coldly upon her came to her.</p>

<p>On the instant she was on her feet and had turned on the one
incandescent globe which dangled from the center of the room. She
went to the mirror hanging above the old walnut dresser in the
corner and stared at herself. Already she imagined she could see
dark rings under her eyes. She felt numb and cold and now shook her
head in a helpless and distracted way. He couldn't be that mean. He
couldn't be that cruel to her now&mdash;could he? Oh, if he but
knew how difficult&mdash;how impossible was the thing he was asking
of her! Oh, if the day would only come so that she could see his
face again! Oh, if it were only another night so that she could
take his hands in hers&mdash;his arm&mdash;feel his arms about
her.</p>

<p>"Clyde, Clyde," she exclaimed half aloud, "you wouldn't do that
to me, would you&mdash;you couldn't."</p>

<p>She crossed to an old, faded and somewhat decrepit overstuffed
chair which stood in the center of the room beside a small table
whereon lay some nondescript books and magazines&mdash;the Saturday
Evening Post, Munsey's, the Popular Science Monthly, Bebe's Garden
Seeds, and to escape most distracting and searing thoughts, sat
down, her chin in her hands, her elbows planted on her knees. But
the painful thoughts continuing and a sense of chill overtaking
her, she took a comforter off the bed and folded it about her, then
opened the seed catalogue&mdash;only to throw it down.</p>

<p>"No, no, no, he couldn't do that to me, he wouldn't." She must
not let him. Why, he had told her over and over that he was crazy
about her&mdash;madly in love with her. They had been to all these
wonderful places together.</p>

<p>And now, without any real consciousness of her movements, she
was moving from the chair to the edge of the bed, sitting with
elbows on knees and chin in hands; or she was before the mirror or
peering restlessly out into the dark to see if there were any trace
of day. And at six, and six-thirty when the light was just breaking
and it was nearing time to dress, she was still up&mdash;in the
chair, on the edge of the bed, in the corner before the mirror.</p>

<p>But she had reached but one definite conclusion and that was
that in some way she must arrange not to have Clyde leave her. That
must not be. There must be something that she could say or do that
would cause him to love her still&mdash;even if, even
if&mdash;well, even if she must let him stop in here or somewhere
from time to time&mdash;some other room in some other rooming house
maybe, where she could arrange in some way beforehand&mdash;say
that he was her brother or something.</p>

<p>But the mood that dominated Clyde was of a different nature. To
have understood it correctly, the full measure and obstinacy and
sullen contentiousness that had suddenly generated, one would have
had to return to Kansas City and the period in which he had been so
futilely dancing attendance upon Hortense Briggs. Also his having
been compelled to give up Rita,&mdash;yet to no end. For, although
the present conditions and situation were different, and he had no
moral authority wherewith to charge Roberta with any such unfair
treatment as Hortense had meted out to him, still there was this
other fact that girls&mdash;all of them&mdash;were obviously
stubborn and self-preservative, always setting themselves apart
from and even above the average man and so wishing to compel him to
do a lot of things for them without their wishing to do anything in
return. And had not Ratterer always told him that in so far as
girls were concerned he was more or less of a fool&mdash;too
easy&mdash;too eager to show his hand and let them know that he was
struck on them. Whereas, as Ratterer had explained, Clyde possessed
the looks&mdash;the "goods"&mdash;and why should he always be
trailing after girls unless they wanted him very much. And this
thought and compliment had impressed him very much at that time.
Only because of the fiascos in connection with Hortense and Rita he
was more earnest now. Yet here he was again in danger of repeating
or bringing upon himself what had befallen him in the case of
Hortense and Rita.</p>

<p>At the same time he was not without the self-incriminating
thought that in seeking this, most distinctly he was driving toward
a relationship which was not legitimate and that would prove
dangerous in the future. For, as he now darkly and vaguely thought,
if he sought a relationship which her prejudices and her training
would not permit her to look upon as anything but evil, was he not
thereby establishing in some form a claim on her part to some
consideration from him in the future which it might not be so easy
for him to ignore? For after all he was the aggressor&mdash;not
she. And because of this, and whatever might follow in connection
with it, might not she be in a position to demand more from him
than he might be willing to give? For was it his intention to marry
her? In the back of his mind there lurked something which even now
assured him that he would never desire to marry her&mdash;could not
in the face of his high family connections here. Therefore should
he proceed to demand&mdash;or should he not? And if he did, could
he avoid that which would preclude any claim in the future?</p>

<p>He did not thus so distinctly voice his inmost feelings to
himself, but relatively of such was their nature. Yet so great was
the temperamental and physical enticement of Roberta that in spite
of a warning nudge or mood that seemed to hint that it was
dangerous for him to persist in his demand, he kept saying to
himself that unless she would permit him to her room, he would not
have anything more to do with her, the desire for her being all but
overpowering.</p>

<p>This contest which every primary union between the sexes,
whether with or without marriage implies, was fought out the next
day in the factory. And yet without a word on either side. For
Clyde, although he considered himself to be deeply in love with
Roberta, was still not so deeply involved but that a naturally
selfish and ambitious and seeking disposition would in this
instance stand its ground and master any impulse. And he was
determined to take the attitude of one who had been injured and was
determined not to be friends any more or yield in any way unless
some concession on her part, such as would appease him, was
made.</p>

<p>And in consequence he came into the stamping department that
morning with the face and air of one who was vastly preoccupied
with matters which had little, if anything, to do with what had
occurred the night before. Yet, being far from certain that this
attitude on his part was likely to lead to anything but defeat, he
was inwardly depressed and awry. For, after all, the sight of
Roberta, freshly arrived, and although pale and distrait, as
charming and energetic as ever, was not calculated to assure him of
any immediate or even ultimate victory. And knowing her as well as
he thought he did, by now, he was but weakly sustained by the
thought that she might yield.</p>

<p>He looked at her repeatedly when she was not looking. And when
in turn she looked at him repeatedly, but only at first when he was
not looking, later when she felt satisfied that his eyes, whether
directly bent on her or not, must be encompassing her, still no
trace of recognition could she extract. And now to her bitter
disappointment, not only did he choose to ignore her, but quite for
the first time since they had been so interested in each other, he
professed to pay, if not exactly conspicuous at least noticeable
and intentional attention to those other girls who were always so
interested in him and who always, as she had been constantly
imagining, were but waiting for any slight overture on his part, to
yield themselves to him in any way that he might dictate.</p>

<p>Now he was looking over the shoulder of Ruza Nikoforitch, her
plump face with its snub nose and weak chin turned engagingly
toward him, and he commenting on something not particularly
connected with the work in hand apparently, for both were idly
smiling. Again, in a little while, he was by the side of Martha
Bordaloue, her plump French shoulders and arms bare to the pits
next to his. And for all her fleshy solidity and decidedly foreign
flavor, there was still enough about her which most men would like.
And with her Clyde was attempting to jest, too.</p>

<p>And later it was Flora Brandt, the very sensuous and not
unpleasing American girl whom Roberta had seen Clyde cultivating
from time to time. Yet, even so, she had never been willing to
believe that he might become interested in any of these. Not Clyde,
surely.</p>

<p>And yet he could not see her at all now&mdash;could not find
time to say a single word, although all these pleasant words and
gay looks for all these others. Oh, how bitter! Oh, how cruel! And
how utterly she despised those other girls with their oglings and
their open attempts to take him from her. Oh, how terrible. Surely
he must be very opposed to her now&mdash;otherwise he could not do
this, and especially after all that had been between them&mdash;the
love&mdash;the kisses.</p>

<p>The hours dragged for both, and with as much poignance for Clyde
as for Roberta. For his was a feverish, urgent disposition where
his dreams were concerned, and could ill brook the delay or
disappointments that are the chief and outstanding characteristics
of the ambitions of men, whatever their nature. He was tortured
hourly by the thought that he was to lose Roberta or that to win
her back he would have to succumb to her wishes.</p>

<p>And on her part she was torn, not so much by the question as to
whether she would have to yield in this matter (for by now that was
almost the least of her worries), but whether, once so yielding,
Clyde would be satisfied with just some form of guarded social
contact in the room&mdash;or not. And so continue on the strength
of that to be friends with her. For more than this she would not
grant&mdash;never. And yet&mdash;this suspense. The misery of his
indifference. She could scarcely endure it from minute to minute,
let alone from hour to hour, and finally in an agony of
dissatisfaction with herself at having brought all this on herself,
she retired to the rest room at about three in the afternoon and
there with the aid of a piece of paper found on the floor and a
small bit of pencil which she had, she composed a brief note:</p>

<blockquote>"Please, Clyde, don't be mad at me, will you? Please
don't. Please look at me and speak to me, won't you? I'm so sorry
about last night, really I am&mdash;terribly. And I must see you
to-night at the end of Elm Street at 8:30 if you can, will you? I
have something to tell you. Please do come. And please do look at
me and tell me you will, even though you are angry. You won't be
sorry. I love you so. You know I do.<br>
<br>
"Your sorrowful,<br>
<br>
"ROBERTA."</blockquote>

<p>And in the spirit of one who is in agonized search for an
opiate, she folded up the paper and returning to the room, drew
close to Clyde's desk. He was before it at the time, bent over some
slips. And quickly as she passed she dropped the paper between his
hands. He looked up instantly, his dark eyes still hard at the
moment with the mingled pain and unrest and dissatisfaction and
determination that had been upon him all day, and noting Roberta's
retreating figure as well as the note, he at once relaxed, a wave
of puzzled satisfaction as well as delight instantly filled him. He
opened it and read. And as instantly his body was suffused with a
warm and yet very weakening ray.</p>

<p>And Roberta in turn, having reached her table and paused to note
if by any chance any one had observed her, now looked cautiously
about, a strained and nervous look in her eyes. But seeing Clyde
looking directly at her, his eyes filled with a conquering and yet
yielding light and a smile upon his lips, and his head nodding a
happy assent, she as suddenly experienced a dizzying sensation, as
though her hitherto constricted blood, detained by a constricted
heart and constricted nerves, were as suddenly set free. And all
the dry marshes and cracked and parched banks of her soul&mdash;the
dry rivulets and streams and lakes of misery that seemed to dot her
being&mdash;were as instantly flooded with this rich upwelling
force of life and love.</p>

<p>He would meet her. They would meet to-night. He would put his
arms around her and kiss her as before. She would be able to look
in his eyes. They would not quarrel any more&mdash;oh, never if she
could help it.</p>

<h3>Chapter 22</h3>

<p>The wonder and, delight of a new and more intimate form of
contact, of protest gainsaid, of scruples overcome! Days, when
both, having struggled in vain against the greater intimacy which
each knew that the other was desirous of yielding to, and
eventually so yielding, looked forward to the approaching night
with an eagerness which was as a fever embodying a fear. For with
what qualms&mdash;what protests on the part of Roberta; what
determination, yet not without a sense of
evil&mdash;seduction&mdash;betrayal, on the part of Clyde. Yet the
thing once done, a wild convulsive pleasure motivating both. Yet,
not without, before all this, an exaction on the part of Roberta to
the effect that never&mdash;come what might (the natural
consequences of so wild an intimacy strong in her thoughts) would
he desert her, since without his aid she would be helpless. Yet,
with no direct statement as to marriage. And he, so completely
overcome and swayed by his desire, thoughtlessly protesting that he
never would&mdash; never. She might depend on that, at least,
although even then there was no thought in his mind of marriage. He
would not do that. Yet nights and nights&mdash;all scruples for the
time being abandoned, and however much by day Roberta might brood
and condemn herself&mdash;when each yielded to the other
completely. And dreamed thereafter, recklessly and wildly, of the
joy of it&mdash;wishing from day to day for the time being that the
long day might end&mdash;that the concealing, rewarding feverish
night were at hand.</p>

<p>And Clyde feeling, and not unlike Roberta, who was firmly and
even painfully convinced of it, that this was sin&mdash;deadly,
mortal&mdash;since both his mother and father had so often
emphasized that&mdash;the seducer&mdash;adulterer&mdash;who preys
outside the sacred precincts of marriage. And Roberta, peering
nervously into the blank future, wondering what&mdash;how, in any
case, by any chance, Clyde should change, or fail her. Yet the
night returning, her mood once more veering, and she as well as he
hurrying to meet somewhere&mdash;only later, in the silence of the
middle night, to slip into this unlighted room which was proving so
much more of a Paradise than either might ever know again&mdash;so
wild and unrecapturable is the fever of youth.</p>

<p>And&mdash;at times&mdash;and despite all his other doubts and
fears, Clyde, because of this sudden abandonment by Roberta of
herself to his desires, feeling for the first time, really, in all
his feverish years, that at last he was a man of the
world&mdash;one who was truly beginning to know women. And so
taking to himself an air or manner that said as plainly as might
have any words&mdash;"Behold I am no longer the inexperienced,
neglected simpleton of but a few weeks ago, but an individual of
import now&mdash;some one who knows something about life. What have
any of these strutting young men, and gay, coaxing, flirting girls
all about me, that I have not? And if I chose&mdash;were less loyal
than I am&mdash;what might I not do?" And this was proving to him
that the notion which Hortense Briggs, to say nothing of the more
recent fiasco in connection with Rita had tended to build up in his
mind, i.e.,&mdash;that he was either unsuccessful or ill-fated
where girls were concerned was false. He was after all and despite
various failures and inhibitions a youth of the Don Juan or
Lothario stripe.</p>

<p>And if now Roberta was obviously willing to sacrifice herself
for him in this fashion, must there not be others?</p>

<p>And this, in spite of the present indifference of the Griffiths,
caused him to walk with even more of an air than had hitherto
characterized him. Even though neither they nor any of those
connected with them recognized him, still he looked at himself in
his mirror from time to time with an assurance and admiration which
before this he had never possessed. For now Roberta, feeling that
her future was really dependent on his will and whim, had set
herself to flatter him almost constantly, to be as obliging and
convenient to him as possible. Indeed, according to her notion of
the proper order of life, she was now his and his only, as much as
any wife is ever to a husband, to do with as he wished.</p>

<p>And for a time therefore, Clyde forgot his rather neglected
state here and was content to devote himself to her without
thinking much of the future. The one thing that did trouble him at
times was the thought that possibly, in connection with the
original fear she had expressed to him, something might go wrong,
which, considering her exclusive devotion to him, might prove
embarrassing. At the same time he did not trouble to speculate too
deeply as to that. He had Roberta now. These relations, in so far
as either of them could see, or guess, were a dark secret. The
pleasures of this left-handed honeymoon were at full tide. And the
remaining brisk and often sunshiny and warm November and first
December days passed&mdash;as in a dream, really&mdash;an ecstatic
paradise of sorts in the very center of a humdrum conventional and
petty and underpaid work-a-day world.</p>

<p>In the meantime the Griffiths had been away from the city since
the middle of June and ever since their departure Clyde had been
meditating upon them and all they represented in his life and that
of the city. Their great house closed and silent, except for
gardeners and an occasional chauffeur or servant visible as he
walked from time to time past the place, was the same as a shrine
to him, nearly&mdash;the symbol of that height to which by some
turn of fate he might still hope to attain. For he had never quite
been able to expel from his mind the thought that his future must
in some way be identified with the grandeur that was here laid out
before him.</p>

<p>Yet so far as the movements of the Griffiths family and their
social peers outside Lycurgus were concerned, he knew little other
than that which from time to time he had read in the society
columns of the two local papers which almost obsequiously pictured
the comings and goings of all those who were connected with the
more important families of the city. At times, after reading these
accounts he had pictured to himself, even when he was off somewhere
with Roberta at some unheralded resort, Gilbert Griffiths racing in
his big car, Bella, Bertine and Sandra dancing, canoeing in the
moonlight, playing tennis, riding at some of the smart resorts
where they were reported to be. The thing had had a bite and ache
for him that was almost unendurable and had lit up for him at times
and with overwhelming clarity this connection of his with Roberta.
For after all, who was she? A factory girl! The daughter of parents
who lived and worked on a farm and one who was compelled to work
for her own living. Whereas he&mdash;he&mdash;if fortune would but
favor him a little&mdash;! Was this to be the end of all his dreams
in connection with his perspective superior life here?</p>

<p>So it was that at moments and in his darker moods, and
especially after she had abandoned herself to him, his thoughts
ran. She was not of his station, really&mdash;at least not of that
of the Griffiths to which still he most eagerly aspired. Yet at the
same time, whatever the mood generated by such items as he read in
The Star, he would still return to Roberta, picturing her, since
the other mood which had drawn him to her had by no means palled as
yet, as delightful, precious, exceedingly worthwhile from the point
of view of beauty, pleasure, sweetness&mdash;the attributes and
charms which best identify any object of delight.</p>

<p>But the Griffiths and their friends having returned to the city,
and Lycurgus once more taken on that brisk, industrial and social
mood which invariably characterized it for at least seven months in
the year, he was again, and even more vigorously than before,
intrigued by it. The beauty of the various houses along Wykeagy
Avenue and its immediate tributaries! The unusual and intriguing
sense of movement and life there so much in evidence. Oh, if he
were but of it!</p>

<h3>Chapter 23</h3>

<p>And then, one November evening as Clyde was walking along
Wykeagy Avenue, just west of Central, a portion of the locally
celebrated avenue which, ever since he had moved to Mrs. Peyton's
he was accustomed to traverse to and from his work, one thing did
occur which in so far as he and the Griffiths were concerned was
destined to bring about a chain of events which none of them could
possibly have foreseen. At the time there was in his heart and mind
that singing which is the inheritance of youth and ambition and
which the dying of the old year, instead of depressing, seemed but
to emphasize. He had a good position. He was respected here. Over
and above his room and board he had not less than fifteen dollars a
week to spend on himself and Roberta, an income which, while it did
not parallel that which had been derived from the Green-Davidson or
the Union League, was still not so involved with family miseries in
the one place or personal loneliness in the other. And he had
Roberta secretly devoted to him. And the Griffiths, thank goodness,
did not and should not know anything of that, though just how in
case of a difficulty it was to be avoided, he was not even
troubling to think. His was a disposition which did not tend to
load itself with more than the most immediate cares.</p>

<p>And although the Griffiths and their friends had not chosen to
recognize him socially, still more and more all others who were not
connected with local society and who knew of him, did. Only this
very day, because the spring before he had been made a room-chief,
perhaps, and Samuel Griffiths had recently paused and talked with
him, no less an important personage than Mr. Rudolph Smillie, one
of the several active vice-presidents, had asked him most cordially
and casually whether he played golf, and if so, when spring came
again, whether he might not be interested to join the Amoskeag, one
of the two really important golf clubs within a half dozen miles of
the city. Now, what could that mean, if not that Mr. Smillie was
beginning to see him as a social possibility, and that he as well
as many others about the factory, were becoming aware of him as
some one who was of some importance to the Griffiths, if not the
factory.</p>

<p>This thought, together with one other&mdash;that once more after
dinner he was to see Roberta and in her room as early as eleven
o'clock or even earlier&mdash;cheered him and caused him to step
along most briskly and gayly. For, since having indulged in this
secret adventure so many times, both were unconsciously becoming
bolder. Not having been detected to date, they were of the notion
that it was possible they might not be. Or if they were Clyde might
be introduced as her brother or cousin for the moment, anyhow, in
order to avoid immediate scandal. Later, to avoid danger of comment
or subsequent detection, as both had agreed after some discussion,
Roberta might have to move to some other place where the same
routine was to be repeated. But that would be easy, or at least
better than no freedom of contact. And with that Roberta had been
compelled to agree.</p>

<p>However, on this occasion there came a contact and an
interruption which set his thoughts careening in an entirely
different direction. Reaching the first of the more important
houses of Wykeagy Avenue, although he had not the slightest idea
who lived there, he was gazing interestedly at the high
wrought-iron fence, as well as the kempt lawn within, dimly
illuminated by street lamps, and upon the surface of which he could
detect many heaps of freshly fallen brown leaves being shaken and
rolled by a winnowing and gamboling wind. It was all so starkly
severe, placid, reserved, beautiful, as he saw it, that he was
quite stirred by the dignity and richness of it. And as he neared
the central gate, above which two lights were burning, making a
circle of light about it, a closed car of great size and solidity
stopped directly in front of it. And the chauffeur stepping down
and opening the door, Clyde instantly recognized Sondra Finchley
leaning forward in the car.</p>

<p>"Go around to the side entrance, David, and tell Miriam that I
can't wait for her because I'm going over to the Trumbulls for
dinner, but that I'll be back by nine. If she's not there, leave
this note and hurry, will you?" The voice and manner were of that
imperious and yet pleasing mode which had so intrigued him the
spring before.</p>

<p>At the same time seeing, as she thought, Gilbert Griffiths
approaching along the sidewalk, she called, "Oh, hello. Walking
to-night? If you want to wait a minute, you can ride out with me.
I've just sent David in with a note. He won't be long."</p>

<p>Now Sondra Finchley, despite the fact that she was interested in
Bella and the Griffiths' wealth and prestige in general was by no
means as well pleased with Gilbert. He had been indifferent to her
in the beginning when she had tried to cultivate him and he had
remained so. He had wounded her pride. And to her, who was
overflowing with vanity and self-conceit, this was the last
offense, and she could not forgive him. She could not and would not
brook the slightest trace of ego in another, and most especially
the vain, cold, self-centered person of Bella's brother. He had too
fine an opinion of himself, as she saw it, was one who was too
bursting with vanity to be of service to anyone. "Hmp! That stick."
It was so that she invariably thought of him. "Who does he think he
is anyhow? He certainly does think he's a lot around here. You'd
think he was a Rockefeller or a Morgan. And for my part I can't see
where he's a bit interesting&mdash;any more. I like Bella. I think
she's lovely. But that smarty. I guess he would like to have a girl
wait on him. Well, not for me." Such in the main were the comments
made by Sondra upon such reported acts and words of Gilbert as were
brought to her by others.</p>

<p>And for his part, Gilbert, hearing of the gyrations, airs, and
aspirations of Sondra from Bella from time to time, was accustomed
to remark: "What, that little snip! Who does she think she is
anyhow? If ever there was a conceited little nut!..."</p>

<p>However, so tightly were the social lines of Lycurgus drawn, so
few the truly eligibles, that it was almost necessary and
compulsory upon those "in" to make the best of such others as were
"in." And so it was that she now greeted Gilbert as she thought.
And as she moved over slightly from the door to make room for him,
Clyde almost petrified by this unexpected recognition, and quite
shaken out of his pose and self-contemplation, not being sure
whether he had heard aright, now approached, his manner the epitome
almost of a self-ingratiating and somewhat affectionate and wistful
dog of high breeding and fine temperament.</p>

<p>"Oh, good evening," he exclaimed, removing his cap and bowing.
"How are you?" while his mind was registering that this truly was
the beautiful, the exquisite Sondra whom months before he had met
at his uncle's, and concerning whose social activities during the
preceding summer he had been reading in the papers. And now here
she was as lovely as ever, seated in this beautiful car and
addressing him, apparently. However, Sondra on the instant
realizing that she had made a mistake and that it was not Gilbert,
was quite embarrassed and uncertain for the moment just how to
extricate herself from a situation which was a bit ticklish, to say
the least.</p>

<p>"Oh, pardon me, you're Mr. Clyde Griffiths, I see now. It's my
mistake. I thought you were Gilbert. I couldn't quite make you out
in the light." She had for the moment an embarrassed and fidgety
and halting manner, which Clyde noticed and which he saw implied
that she had made a mistake that was not entirely flattering to him
nor satisfactory to her. And this in turn caused him to become
confused and anxious to retire.</p>

<p>"Oh, pardon me. But that's all right. I didn't mean to intrude.
I thought..." He flushed and stepped back really troubled.</p>

<p>But now Sondra, seeing at once that Clyde was if anything much
more attractive than his cousin and far more diffident, and
obviously greatly impressed by her charms as well as her social
state, unbent sufficiently to say with a charming smile: "But
that's all right. Won't you get in, please, and let me take you
where you are going. Oh, I wish you would. I will be so glad to
take you."</p>

<p>For there was that in Clyde's manner the instant he learned that
it was due to a mistake that he had been recognized which caused
even her to understand that he was hurt, abashed and disappointed.
His eyes took on a hurt look and there was a wavering, apologetic,
sorrowful smile playing about his lips.</p>

<p>"Why, yes, of course," he said jerkily, "that is, if you want me
to. I understand how it was. That's all right. But you needn't
mind, if you don't wish to. I thought..." He had half turned to go,
but was so drawn by her that he could scarcely tear himself away
before she repeated: "Oh, do come, get in, Mr. Griffiths. I'll be
so glad if you will. It won t take David a moment to take you
wherever you are going, I'm sure. And I am sorry about the other,
really I am. I didn't mean, you know, that just because you weren't
Gilbert Griffiths&mdash;"</p>

<p>He paused and in a bewildered manner stepped forward and
entering the car, slipped into the seat beside her. And she,
interested by his personality, at once began to look at him,
feeling glad that it was he now instead of Gilbert. In order the
better to see and again reveal her devastating charms, as she saw
them, to Clyde, she now switched on the roof light. And the
chauffeur returning, she asked Clyde where he wished to go&mdash;an
address which he gave reluctantly enough, since it was so different
from the street in which she resided. As the car sped on, he was
animated by a feverish desire to make some use of this brief
occasion which might cause her to think favorably of
him&mdash;perhaps, who knows&mdash;lead to some faint desire on her
part to contact him again at some time or other. He was so truly
eager to be of her world.</p>

<p>"It's certainly nice of you to take me up this way," he now
turned to her and observed, smiling. "I didn't think it was my
cousin you meant or I wouldn't have come up as I did."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's all right. Don't mention it," replied Sondra archly
with a kind of sticky sweetness in her voice. Her original
impression of him as she now felt, had been by no means so vivid.
"It's my mistake, not yours. But I'm glad I made it now, anyhow,"
she added most definitely and with an engaging smile. "I think I'd
rather pick you up than I would Gil, anyhow. We don't get along any
too well, he and I. We quarrel a lot whenever we do meet anywhere."
She smiled, having completely recovered from her momentary
embarrassment, and now leaned back after the best princess fashion,
her glance examining Clyde's very regular features with interest.
He had such soft smiling eyes she thought. And after all, as she
now reasoned, he was Bella's and Gilbert's cousin, and looked
prosperous.</p>

<p>"Well, that's too bad," he said stiffly, and with a very awkward
and weak attempt at being self-confident and even high-spirited in
her presence.</p>

<p>"Oh, it doesn't amount to anything, really. We just quarrel,
that's all, once in a while."</p>

<p>She saw that he was nervous and bashful and decidedly
unresourceful in her presence and it pleased her to think that she
could thus befuddle and embarrass him so much. "Are you still
working for your uncle?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," replied Clyde quickly, as though it would make an
enormous difference to her if he were not. "I have charge of a
department over there now."</p>

<p>"Oh, really, I didn't know. I haven't seen you at all, since
that one time, you know. You don't get time to go about much, I
suppose." She looked at him wisely, as much as to say, "Your
relatives aren't so very much interested in you," but really liking
him now, she said instead, "You have been in the city all summer, I
suppose?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," replied Clyde quite simply and winningly. "I have to
be, you know. It's the work that keeps me here. But I've seen your
name in the papers often, and read about your riding and tennis
contests and I saw you in that flower parade last June, too. I
certainly thought you looked beautiful, like an angel almost."</p>

<p>There was an admiring, pleading light in his eyes which now
quite charmed her. What a pleasing young man&mdash;so different to
Gilbert. And to think he should be so plainly and hopelessly
smitten, and when she could take no more than a passing interest in
him. It made her feel sorry, a little, and hence kindly toward him.
Besides what would Gilbert think if only he knew that his cousin
was so completely reduced by her&mdash;how angry he would
be&mdash;he, who so plainly thought her a snip? It would serve him
just right if Clyde were taken up by some one and made more of than
he (Gilbert) ever could hope to be. The thought had a most pleasing
tang for her.</p>

<p>However, at this point, unfortunately, the car turned in before
Mrs. Peyton's door and stopped. The adventure for Clyde and for her
was seemingly over.</p>

<p>"That's awfully nice of you to say that. I won't forget that."
She smiled archly as, the chauffeur opening the door, Clyde stepped
down, his own nerves taut because of the grandeur and import of
this encounter. "So this is where you live. Do you expect to be in
Lycurgus all winter?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. I'm quite sure of it. I hope to be anyhow," he added,
quite yearningly, his eyes expressing his meaning completely.</p>

<p>"Well, perhaps, then I'll see you again somewhere, some time. I
hope so, anyhow."</p>

<p>She nodded and gave him her fingers and the most fetching and
wreathy of smiles, and he, eager to the point of folly, added: "Oh,
so do I."</p>

<p>"Good night! Good night!" she called as the car sprang away, and
Clyde, looking after it, wondered if he would ever see her again so
closely and intimately as here. To think that he should have met
her again in this way! And she had proved so very different from
that first time when, as he distinctly recalled, she took no
interest in him at all.</p>

<p>He turned hopefully and a little wistfully toward his own
door.</p>

<p>And Sondra...why was it, she pondered, as the motor car sped on
its way, that the Griffiths were apparently not much interested in
him?</p>

<h3>Chapter 24</h3>

<p>The effect of this so casual contact was really disrupting in
more senses than one. For now in spite of his comfort in and
satisfaction with Roberta, once more and in this positive and to
him entrancing way, was posed the whole question of his social
possibilities here. And that strangely enough by the one girl of
this upper level who had most materialized and magnified for him
the meaning of that upper level itself. The beautiful Sondra
Finchley! Her lovely face, smart clothes, gay and superior
demeanor! If only at the time he had first encountered her he had
managed to interest her. Or could now.</p>

<p>The fact that his relations with Roberta were what they were now
was not of sufficient import or weight to offset the temperamental
or imaginative pull of such a girl as Sondra and all that she
represented. Just to think the Wimblinger Finchley Electric Sweeper
Company was one of the largest manufacturing concerns here. Its
tall walls and stacks made a part of the striking sky line across
the Mohawk. And the Finchley residence in Wykeagy Avenue, near that
of the Griffiths, was one of the most impressive among that
distinguished row of houses which had come with the latest and most
discriminating architectural taste here&mdash;Italian
Renaissance&mdash; cream hued marble and Dutchess County sandstone
combined. And the Finchleys were among the most discussed of
families here.</p>

<p>Ah, to know this perfect girl more intimately! To be looked upon
by her with favor,&mdash;made, by reason of that favor, a part of
that fine world to which she belonged. Was he not a
Griffiths&mdash;as good looking as Gilbert Griffiths any day? And
as attractive if he only had as much money&mdash;or a part of it
even. To be able to dress in the Gilbert Griffiths' fashion; to
ride around in one of the handsome cars he sported! Then, you bet,
a girl like this would be delighted to notice him,&mdash;mayhap,
who knows, even fall in love with him. Analschar and the tray of
glasses. But now, as he gloomily thought, he could only hope, hope,
hope.</p>

<p>The devil! He would not go around to Roberta's this evening. He
would trump up some excuse&mdash;tell her in the morning that he
had been called upon by his uncle or cousin to do some work. He
could not and would not go, feeling as he did just now.</p>

<p>So much for the effect of wealth, beauty, the peculiar social
state to which he most aspired, on a temperament that was as fluid
and unstable as water.</p>

<p>On the other hand, later, thinking over her contact with Clyde,
Sondra was definitely taken with what may only be described as his
charm for her, all the more definite in this case since it
represented a direct opposite to all that his cousin offered by way
of offense. His clothes and his manner, as well as a remark he had
dropped, to the effect that he was connected with the company in
some official capacity, seemed to indicate that he might be better
placed than she had imagined. Yet she also recalled that although
she had been about with Bella all summer and had encountered
Gilbert, Myra and their parents from time to time, there had never
been a word about Clyde. Indeed all the information she had
gathered concerning him was that originally furnished by Mrs.
Griffiths, who had said that he was a poor nephew whom her husband
had brought on from the west in order to help in some way. Yet now,
as she viewed Clyde on this occasion, he did not seem so utterly
unimportant or poverty-stricken by any means&mdash;quite
interesting and rather smart and very attractive, and obviously
anxious to be taken seriously by a girl like herself, as she could
see. And this coming from Gilbert's cousin&mdash;a
Griffiths&mdash;was flattering.</p>

<p>Arriving at the Trumbull's, a family which centered about one
Douglas Trumbull, a prosperous lawyer and widower and speculator of
this region, who, by reason of his children as well as his own good
manners and legal subtlety, had managed to ingratiate himself into
the best circles of Lycurgus society, she suddenly confided to Jill
Trumbull, the elder of the lawyer's two daughters: "You know I had
a funny experience to-day." And she proceeded to relate all that
had occurred in detail. Afterward at dinner, Jill having appeared
to find it most fascinating, she again repeated it to Gertrude and
Tracy, the younger daughter and only son of the Trumbull
family.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," observed Tracy Trumbull, a law student in his
father's office, "I've seen that fellow, I bet, three or four times
on Central Avenue. He looks a lot like Gil, doesn't he? Only not so
swagger. I've nodded to him two or three times this summer because
I thought he was Gil for the moment."</p>

<p>"Oh, I've seen him, too," commented Gertrude Trumbull. "He wears
a cap and a belted coat like Gilbert Griffiths, sometimes, doesn't
he? Arabella Stark pointed him out to me once and then Jill and I
saw him passing Stark's once on a Saturday afternoon. He is better
looking than Gil, any day, I think."</p>

<p>This confirmed Sondra in her own thoughts in regard to Clyde and
now she added: "Bertine Cranston and I met him one evening last
spring at the Griffiths'. We thought he was too bashful, then. But
I wish you could see him now&mdash;he's positively handsome, with
the softest eyes and the nicest smile."</p>

<p>"Oh, now, Sondra," commented Jill Trumbull, who, apart from
Bertine and Bella, was as close to Sondra as any girl here, having
been one of her classmates at the Snedeker School, "I know some one
who would be jealous if he could hear you say that."</p>

<p>"And wouldn't Gil Griffiths like to hear that his cousin's
better looking than he is?" chimed in Tracy Trumbull. "Oh,
say&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, he," sniffed Sondra irritably. "He thinks he's so much.
I'll bet anything it's because of him that the Griffiths won't have
anything to do with their cousin. I'm sure of it, now that I think
of it. Bella would, of course, because I heard her say last spring
that she thought he was good-looking. And Myra wouldn't do anything
to hurt anybody. What a lark if some of us were to take him up some
time and begin inviting him here and there&mdash;once in a while,
you know&mdash;just for fun, to see how he would do. And how the
Griffiths would take it. I know well enough it would be all right
with Mr. Griffiths and Myra and Bella, but Gil I'll bet would be as
peeved as anything. I couldn't do it myself very well, because I'm
so close to Bella, but I know who could and they couldn't say a
thing." She paused, thinking of Bertine Cranston and how she
disliked Gil and Mrs. Griffiths. "I wonder if he dances or rides or
plays tennis or anything like that?" She stopped and meditated
amusedly, the while the others studied her. And Jill Trumbull, a
restless, eager girl like herself, without so much of her looks or
flair, however, observed: "It would be a prank, wouldn't it? Do you
suppose the Griffiths really would dislike it very much?"</p>

<p>"What's the difference if they did?" went on Sondra. "They
couldn't do anything more than ignore him, could they? And who
would care about that, I'd like to know. Not the people who invited
him."</p>

<p>"Go on, you fellows, stir up a local scrap, will you?" put in
Tracy Trumbull. "I'll bet anything that's what comes of it in the
end. Gil Griffiths won't like it, you can gamble on that. I
wouldn't if I were in his position. If you want to stir up a lot of
feeling here, go to it, but I'll lay a bet that's what it comes
to."</p>

<p>Now Sondra Finchley's nature was of just such a turn that a
thought of this kind was most appealing to her. However, as
interesting as the idea was to her at the time, nothing definite
might have come of it, had it not been that subsequent to this
conversation and several others held with Bertine Cranston, Jill
Trumbull, Patricia Anthony, and Arabella Stark, the news of this
adventure, together with some comments as to himself, finally came
to the ears of Gilbert Griffiths, yet only via Constance Wynant to
whom, as local gossips would have it, he was prospectively engaged.
And Constance, hoping that Gilbert would marry her eventually, was
herself irritated by the report that Sondra had chosen to interest
herself in Clyde, and then, for no sane reason, as she saw it,
proclaim that he was more attractive than Gilbert. So, as much to
relieve herself as to lay some plan of avenging herself upon
Sondra, if possible, she conveyed the whole matter in turn to
Gilbert, who at once proceeded to make various cutting references
to Clyde and Sondra. And these carried back to Sondra, along with
certain embellishments by Constance, had the desired effect. It
served to awaken in her the keenest desire for retaliation. For if
she chose she certainly could be nice to Clyde, and have others be
nice to him, too. And that would mean perhaps that Gilbert would
find himself faced by a social rival of sorts&mdash;his own cousin,
too, who, even though he was poor, might come to be liked better.
What a lark! At the very same time there came to her a way by which
she might most easily introduce Clyde, and yet without seeming so
to do, and without any great harm to herself, if it did not
terminate as she wished.</p>

<p>For in Lycurgus among the younger members of those smarter
families whose children had been to the Snedeker School, existed a
rather illusory and casual dinner and dance club called the "Now
and Then." It had no definite organization, officers or abode. Any
one, who, because of class and social connections was eligible and
chose to belong, could call a meeting of other members to give a
dinner or dance or tea in their homes.</p>

<p>And how simple, thought Sondra in browsing around for a suitable
vehicle by which to introduce Clyde, if some one other than herself
who belonged could be induced to get up something and then at her
suggestion invite Clyde. How easy, say, for Jill Trumbull to give a
dinner and dance to the "Now and Thens," to which Clyde might be
invited. And by this ruse she would thus be able to see him again
and find out just how much he did interest her and what he was
like.</p>

<p>Accordingly a small dinner for this club and its friends was
announced for the first Thursday in December, Jill Trumbull to be
the hostess. To it were to be invited Sondra and her brother,
Stuart, Tracy and Gertrude Trumbull, Arabella Stark, Bertine and
her brother, and some others from Utica and Gloversville as well.
And Clyde. But in order to safeguard Clyde against any chance of
failure or even invidious comment of any kind, not only she but
Bertine and Jill and Gertrude were to be attentive to and
considerate of him. They were to see that his dance program was
complete and that neither at dinner nor on the dance floor was he
to be left to himself, but was to be passed on most artfully from
one to the other until evening should be over. For, by reason of
that, others might come to be interested in him, which would not
only take the thorn from the thought that Sondra alone, of all the
better people of Lycurgus, had been friendly to him, but would
sharpen the point of this development for Gilbert, if not for Bella
and the other members of the Griffiths family.</p>

<p>And in accordance with this plan, so it was done.</p>

<p>And so it was that Clyde, returning from the factory one early
December evening about two weeks after his encounter with Sondra,
was surprised by the sight of a cream-colored note leaning against
the mirror of his dresser. It was addressed in a large, scrawly and
unfamiliar hand. He picked it up and turned it over without being
able in any way to fix upon the source. On the back were the
initials B. T. or J. T., he could not decide which, so elaborately
intertwined was the engraved penmanship. He tore it open and drew
out a card which read:</p>

<blockquote>The Now and Then Club<br>
Will Hold Its First<br>
Winter Dinner Dance<br>
At the Home of<br>
Douglas Trumbull<br>
135 Wykeagy Ave<br>
On Thursday, December 4<br>
You Are Cordially Invited<br>
Will You Kindly Reply to Miss Jill Trumbull?</blockquote>

<p>On the back of this, though, in the same scrawly hand that
graced the envelope was written: "Dear Mr. Griffiths: Thought you
might like to come. It will be quite informal. And I'm sure you'll
like it. If so, will you let Jill Trumbull know? Sondra
Finchley."</p>

<p>Quite amazed and thrilled, Clyde stood and stared. For ever
since that second contact with her, he had been more definitely
fascinated than at any time before by the dream that somehow, in
some way, he was to be lifted from the lowly state in which he now
dwelt. He was, as he now saw it, really too good for the
Commonplace world by which he was environed. And now here was
this&mdash;a social invitation issued by the "Now and Then Club,"
of which, even though he had never heard of it, must be something
since it was sponsored by such exceptional people. And on the back
of it, was there not the writing of Sondra herself? How marvelous,
really!</p>

<p>So astonished was he that he could scarcely contain himself for
joy, but now on the instant must walk to and fro, looking at
himself in the mirror, washing his hands and face, then deciding
that his tie was not just right, perhaps, and changing to
another&mdash; thinking forward to what he should wear and back
upon how Sondra had looked at him on that last occasion. And how
she had smiled. At the same time he could not help wondering even
at this moment of what Roberta would think, if now, by some extra
optical power of observation she could note his present joy in
connection with this note. For plainly, and because he was no
longer governed by the conventional notions of his parents, he had
been allowing himself to drift into a position in regard to her
which would certainly spell torture to her in case she should
discover the nature of his present mood, a thought which puzzled
him not a little, but did not serve to modify his thoughts in
regard to Sondra in the least.</p>

<p>That wonderful girl!</p>

<p>That beauty!</p>

<p>That world of wealth and social position she lived in!</p>

<p>At the same time so innately pagan and unconventional were his
thoughts in regard to all this that he could now ask himself, and
that seriously enough, why should he not be allowed to direct his
thoughts toward her and away from Roberta, since at the moment
Sondra supplied the keener thought of delight. Roberta could not
know about this. She could not see into his mind, could she&mdash;
become aware of any such extra experience as this unless he told
her. And most assuredly he did not intend to tell her. And what
harm, he now asked himself, was there in a poor youth like himself
aspiring to such heights? Other youths as poor as himself had
married girls as rich as Sondra.</p>

<p>For in spite of all that had occurred between him and Roberta he
had not, as he now clearly recalled, given her his word that he
would marry her except under one condition. And such a condition,
especially with the knowledge that he had all too clearly acquired
in Kansas City, was not likely to happen as he thought.</p>

<p>And Sondra, now that she had thus suddenly burst upon him again
in this way was the same as a fever to his fancy. This goddess in
her shrine of gilt and tinsel so utterly enticing to him, had
deigned to remember him in this open and direct way and to suggest
that he be invited. And no doubt she, herself, was going to be
there, a thought which thrilled him beyond measure.</p>

<p>And what would not Gilbert and the Griffiths think if they were
to hear of his going to this affair now, as they surely would? Or
meet him later at some other party to which Sondra might invite
him? Think of that! Would it irritate or please them? Make them
think less or more of him? For, after all, this certainly was not
of his doing. Was he not properly invited by people of their own
station here in Lycurgus whom most certainly they were compelled to
respect? And by no device of his, either&mdash;sheer
accident&mdash;the facts concerning which would most certainly not
reflect on him as pushing. As lacking as he was in some of the
finer shades of mental discrimination, a sly and ironic pleasure
lay in the thought that now Gilbert and the Griffiths might be
compelled to countenance him whether they would or not&mdash;invite
him to their home, even. For, if these others did, how could they
avoid it, really? Oh, joy! And that in the face of Gilbert's high
contempt for him. He fairly chuckled as he thought of it, feeling
that however much Gilbert might resent it, neither his uncle nor
Myra were likely to, and that hence he would be fairly safe from
any secret desire on the part of Gilbert to revenge himself on him
for this.</p>

<p>But how wonderful this invitation! Why that intriguing scribble
of Sondra's unless she was interested in him some? Why? The thought
was so thrilling that Clyde could scarcely eat his dinner that
night. He took up the card and kissed the handwriting. And instead
of going to see Roberta as usual, he decided as before on first
reencountering her, to walk a bit, then return to his room, and
retire early. And on the morrow as before he could make some
excuse&mdash;say that he had been over to the Griffiths' home, or
some one of the heads of the factory, in order to listen to an
explanation in regard to something in connection with the work,
since there were often such conferences. For, in the face of this,
he did not care to see or talk to Roberta this night. He could not.
The other thought&mdash;that of Sondra and her interest in
him&mdash; was too enticing.</p>

<h3>Chapter 25</h3>

<p>But in the interim, in connection with his relations with
Roberta no least reference to Sondra, although, even when near her
in the factory or her room, he could not keep his thoughts from
wandering away to where Sondra in her imaginary high social world
might be. The while Roberta, at moments only sensing a drift and
remoteness in his thought and attitude which had nothing to do with
her, was wondering what it was that of late was beginning to occupy
him so completely. And he, in his turn, when she was not looking
was thinking&mdash;supposing?&mdash;supposing&mdash;(since she had
troubled to recall herself to him), that he could interest a girl
like Sondra in him? What then of Roberta? What? And in the face of
this intimate relation that had now been established between them?
(Goodness! The deuce!) And that he did care for her (yes, he did),
although now&mdash;basking in the direct rays of this newer
luminary&mdash;he could scarcely see Roberta any longer, so strong
were the actinic rays of this other. Was he all wrong? Was it evil
to be like this? His mother would say so! And his father
too&mdash;and perhaps everybody who thought right about
life&mdash;Sondra Finchley, maybe&mdash;the Griffiths&mdash;
all.</p>

<p>And yet! And yet! It was snowing the first light snow of the
year as Clyde, arrayed in a new collapsible silk hat and white silk
muffler, both suggested by a friendly haberdasher&mdash;Orrin
Short, with whom recently he had come in contact here&mdash;and a
new silk umbrella wherewith to protect himself from the snow, made
his way toward the very interesting, if not so very imposing
residence of the Trumbulls on Wykeagy Avenue. It was quaint, low
and rambling, and the lights beaming from within upon the many
drawn blinds gave it a Christmas-card effect. And before it, even
at the prompt hour at which he arrived, were ranged a half dozen
handsome cars of various builds and colors. The sight of them,
sprinkled on tops, running boards and fenders with the fresh, flaky
snow, gave him a keen sense of a deficiency that was not likely
soon to be remedied in his case&mdash;the want of ample means
wherewith to equip himself with such a necessity as that. And
inside as he approached the door he could hear voices, laughter and
conversation commingled.</p>

<p>A tall, thin servant relieved him of his hat, coat and umbrella
and he found himself face to face with Jill Trumbull, who
apparently was on the look-out for him&mdash;a smooth, curly-haired
blonde girl, not too thrillingly pretty, but brisk and smart, in
white satin with arms and shoulders bare and rhinestones banded
around her forehead.</p>

<p>"No trouble to tell who you are," she said gayly, approaching
and giving Clyde her hand. "I'm Jill Trumbull. Miss Finchley hasn't
come yet. But I can do the honors just as well, I guess. Come right
in where the rest of us are."</p>

<p>She led the way into a series of connecting rooms that seemed to
join each other at right angles, adding as she went, "You do look
an awful lot like Gil Griffiths, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Do I?" smiled Clyde simply and courageously and very much
flattered by the comparison.</p>

<p>The ceilings were low. Pretty lamps behind painted shades hugged
dark walls. Open fires in two connecting rooms cast a rosy glow
upon cushioned and comfortable furniture. There were pictures,
books, objects of art.</p>

<p>"Here, Tracy, you do the announcing, will you?" she called. "My
brother, Tracy Trumbull, Mr. Griffiths. Mr. Clyde Griffiths,
everybody," she added, surveying the company in general which in
turn fixed varying eyes upon him, while Tracy Trumbull took him by
the hand. Clyde, suffering from a sense of being studied,
nevertheless achieved a warm smile. At the same time he realized
that for the moment at least conversation had stopped. "Don't all
stop talking on my account," he ventured, with a smile, which
caused most of those present to conceive of him as at his ease and
resourceful. At the same time Tracy added: "I'm not going to do any
man-to-man introduction stuff. We'll stand right here and point 'em
out. That's my sister, Gertrude, over there talking to Scott
Nicholson." Clyde noted that a small, dark girl dressed in pink
with a pretty and yet saucy and piquant face, nodded to him. And
beside her a very de rigueur youth of fine physique and pink
complexion nodded jerkily. "Howja do." And a few feet from them
near a deep window stood a tall and yet graceful girl of dark and
by no means ravishing features talking to a broad-shouldered and
deep-chested youth of less than her height, who were proclaimed to
be Arabella Stark and Frank Harriet. "They're arguing over a recent
Cornell-Syracuse foot-ball game...Burchard Taylor and Miss Phant of
Utica," he went on almost too swiftly for Clyde to assemble any
mental notes. "Perley Haynes and Miss Vanda Steele...well, I guess
that's all as yet. Oh, no, here come Grant and Nina Temple." Clyde
paused and gazed as a tall and somewhat dandified-looking youth,
sharp of face and with murky-gray eyes, steered a trim, young,
plump girl in fawn gray and with a light chestnut braid of hair
laid carefully above her forehead, into the middle of the room.</p>

<p>"Hello, Jill. Hello, Vanda. Hello, Wynette." In the midst of
these greetings on his part, Clyde was presented to these two,
neither of whom seemed to pay much attention to him. "Didn't think
we'd make it," went on young Cranston speaking to all at once.
"Nina didn't want to come, but I promised Bertine and Jill or I
wouldn't have, either. We were up at the Bagleys'. Guess who's up
there, Scott. Van Peterson and Rhoda Hull. They're just over for
the day."</p>

<p>"You don't say," called Scott Nicholson, a determined and
self-centered looking individual. Clyde was arrested by the very
definite sense of social security and ease that seemed to reside in
everybody. "Why didn't you bring 'em along? I'd like to see Rhoda
again and Van, too."</p>

<p>"Couldn't. They have to go back early, they say. They may stop
in later for a minute. Gee, isn't dinner served yet? I expected to
sit right down."</p>

<p>"These lawyers! Don't you know they don't eat often?" commented
Frank Harriet, who was a short, but broad-chested and smiling
youth, very agreeable, very good-looking and with even, white
teeth. Clyde liked him.</p>

<p>"Well, whether they do or not, we do, or out I go. Did you hear
who is being touted for stroke next year over at Cornell?" This
college chatter relating to Cornell and shared by Harriet, Cranston
and others, Clyde could not understand. He had scarcely heard of
the various colleges with which this group was all too familiar. At
the same time he was wise enough to sense the defect and steer
clear of any questions or conversations which might relate to them.
However, because of this, he at once felt out of it. These people
were better informed than he was&mdash;had been to colleges.
Perhaps he had better claim that he had been to some school. In
Kansas City he had heard of the State University of
Kansas&mdash;not so very far from there. Also the University of
Missouri. And in Chicago of the University of Chicago. Could he say
that he had been to one of those&mdash;that Kansas one, for a
little while, anyway? On the instant he proposed to claim it, if
asked, and then look up afterwards what, if anything, he was
supposed to know about it&mdash;what, for instance, he might have
studied. He had heard of mathematics somewhere. Why not that?</p>

<p>But these people, as he could see, were too much interested in
themselves to pay much attention to him now. He might be a
Griffiths and important to some outside, but here not so
much&mdash;a matter of course, as it were. And because Tracy
Trumbull for the moment had turned to say something to Wynette
Phant, he felt quite alone, beached and helpless and with no one to
talk to. But just then the small, dark girl, Gertrude, came over to
him.</p>

<p>"The crowd's a little late in getting together. It always is. If
we said eight, they'd come at eight-thirty or nine. Isn't that
always the way?"</p>

<p>"It certainly is," replied Clyde gratefully, endeavoring to
appear as brisk and as much at ease as possible.</p>

<p>"I'm Gertrude Trumbull," she repeated. "The sister of the
good-looking Jill," a cynical and yet amused smile played about her
mouth and eyes. "You nodded to me, but you don't know me. Just the
same we've been hearing a lot about you." She teased in an attempt
to trouble Clyde a little, if possible. "A mysterious Griffiths
here in Lycurgus whom no one seems to have met. I saw you once in
Central Avenue, though. You were going into Rich's candy store. You
didn't know that, though. Do you like candy?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I like candy. Why?" asked Clyde on the instant feeling
teased and disturbed, since the girl for whom he was buying the
candy was Roberta. At the same time he could not help feeling
slightly more at ease with this girl than with some others, for
although cynical and not so attractive, her manner was genial and
she now spelled escape from isolation and hence diffidence.</p>

<p>"You're probably just saying that," she laughed, a bantering
look in her eyes. "More likely you were buying it for some girl.
You have a girl, haven't you?"</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;" Clyde paused for the fraction of a second because
as she asked this Roberta came into his mind and the query, "Had
any one ever seen him with Roberta?" flitted through his brain.
Also thinking at the same time, what a bold, teasing, intelligent
girl this was, different from any that thus far he had known. Yet
quite without more pause he added: "No, I haven't. What makes you
ask that?"</p>

<p>As he said this there came to him the thought of what Roberta
would think if she could hear him. "But what a question," he
continued a little nervously now. "You like to tease, don't
you?"</p>

<p>"Who, me? Oh, no. I wouldn't do anything like that. But I'm sure
you have just the same. I like to ask questions sometimes, just to
see what people will say when they don't want you to know what they
really think." She beamed into Clyde's eyes amusedly and defiantly.
"But I know you have a girl just the same. All good-looking fellows
have."</p>

<p>"Oh, am I good-looking?" he beamed nervously, amused and yet
pleased. "Who said so?"</p>

<p>"As though you didn't know. Well, different people. I for one.
And Sondra Finchley thinks you're good-looking, too. She's only
interested in men who are. So does my sister Jill, for that matter.
And she only likes men who are good-looking. I'm different because
I'm not so good-looking myself." She blinked cynically and
teasingly into his eyes, which caused him to feel oddly out of
place, not able to cope with such a girl at all, at the same time
very much flattered and amused. "But don't you think you're better
looking than your cousin," she went on sharply and even
commandingly. "Some people think you are."</p>

<p>Although a little staggered and yet flattered by this question
which propounded what he might have liked to believe, and although
intrigued by this girl's interest in him, still Clyde would not
have dreamed of venturing any such assertion even though he had
believed it. Too vividly it brought the aggressive and determined
and even at times revengeful-looking features of Gilbert before
him, who, stirred by such a report as this, would not hesitate to
pay him out.</p>

<p>"Why, I don't think anything of the kind," he laughed. "Honest,
I don't. Of course I don't."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, then maybe you don't, but you are just the same. But
that won't help you much either, unless you have money&mdash;that
is, if you want to run with people who have." She looked up at him
and added quite blandly. "People like money even more than they do
looks."</p>

<p>What a sharp girl this was, he thought, and what a hard, cold
statement. It cut him not a little, even though she had not
intended that it should.</p>

<p>But just then Sondra herself entered with some youth whom Clyde
did not know&mdash;a tall, gangling, but very smartly-dressed
individual. And after them, along with others, Bertine and Stuart
Finchley.</p>

<p>"Here she is now," added Gertrude a little spitefully, for she
resented the fact that Sondra was so much better-looking than
either she or her sister, and that she had expressed an interest in
Clyde. "She'll be looking to see if you notice how pretty she
looks, so don't disappoint her."</p>

<p>The impact of this remark, a reflection of the exact truth, was
not necessary to cause Clyde to gaze attentively, and even eagerly.
For apart from her local position and means and taste in dress and
manners, Sondra was of the exact order and spirit that most
intrigued him&mdash;a somewhat refined (and because of means and
position showered upon her) less savage, although scarcely less
self-centered, Hortense Briggs. She was, in her small, intense way,
a seeking Aphrodite, eager to prove to any who were sufficiently
attractive the destroying power of her charm, while at the same
time retaining her own personality and individuality free of any
entangling alliance or compromise. However, for varying reasons
which she could not quite explain to herself, Clyde appealed to
her. He might not be anything socially or financially, but he was
interesting to her.</p>

<p>Hence she was now keen, first to see if he were present, next to
be sure that he gained no hint that she had seen him first, and
lastly to act as grandly as possible for his benefit&mdash;a
Hortensian procedure and type of thought that was exactly the thing
best calculated to impress him. He gazed and there she
was&mdash;tripping here and there in a filmy chiffon dance frock,
shaded from palest yellow to deepest orange, which most enhanced
her dark eyes and hair. And having exchanged a dozen or more "Oh,
Hellos," and references with one and another to this, that and the
other local event, she at last condescended to evince awareness of
his proximity.</p>

<p>"Oh, here you are. You decided to come after all. I wasn't sure
whether you would think it worth while. You've been introduced to
everybody, of course?" She looked around as much as to say, that if
he had not been she would proceed to serve him in this way. The
others, not so very much impressed by Clyde, were still not a
little interested by the fact that she seemed so interested in
him.</p>

<p>"Yes, I met nearly everybody, I think."</p>

<p>"Except Freddie Sells. He came in with me just now. Here you
are, Freddie," she called to a tall and slender youth, smooth of
cheek and obviously becurled as to hair, who now came over and in
his closely-fitting dress coat looked down on Clyde about as a
spring rooster might look down on a sparrow.</p>

<p>"This is Clyde Griffiths, I was telling you about, Fred," she
began briskly. "Doesn't he look a lot like Gilbert?"</p>

<p>"Why, you do at that," exclaimed this amiable person, who seemed
to be slightly troubled with weak eyes since he bent close. "I hear
you're a cousin of Gil's. I know him well. We went through
Princeton together. I used to be over here before I joined the
General Electric over at Schenectady. But I'm around a good bit
yet. You're connected with the factory, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Yes, I am," said Clyde, who, before a youth of obviously so
much more training and schooling than he possessed, felt not a
little reduced. He began to fear that this individual would try to
talk to him about things which he could not understand, things
concerning which, having had no consecutive training of any kind,
he had never been technically informed.</p>

<p>"In charge of some department, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I am," said Clyde, cautiously and nervously.</p>

<p>"You know," went on Mr. Sells, briskly and interestingly, being
of a commercial as well as technical turn, "I've always wondered
just what, outside of money, there is to the collar business. Gil
and I used to argue about that when we were down at college. He
used to try to tell me that there was some social importance to
making and distributing collars, giving polish and manner to people
who wouldn't otherwise have them, if it weren't for cheap collars.
I think he musta read that in a book somewhere. I always laughed at
him."</p>

<p>Clyde was about to attempt an answer, although already beyond
his depth in regard to this. "Social importance." Just what did he
mean by that&mdash;some deep, scientific information that he had
acquired at college. He was saved a non-committal or totally
uninformed answer by Sondra who, without thought or knowledge of
the difficulty which was then and there before him, exclaimed: "Oh,
no arguments, Freddie. That's not interesting. Besides I want him
to meet my brother and Bertine. You remember Miss Cranston. She was
with me at your uncle's last spring."</p>

<p>Clyde turned, while Fred made the best of the rebuff by merely
looking at Sondra, whom he admired so very much.</p>

<p>"Yes, of course," Clyde began, for he had been studying these
two along with others. To him, apart from Sondra, Bertine seemed
exceedingly attractive, though quite beyond his understanding also.
Being involved, insincere and sly, she merely evoked in him a
troubled sense of ineffectiveness, and hence uncertainty, in so far
as her particular world was concerned&mdash;no more.</p>

<p>"Oh, how do you do? It's nice to see you again," she drawled,
the while her greenish-gray eyes went over him in a smiling and yet
indifferent and quizzical way. She thought him attractive, but not
nearly as shrewd and hard as she would have preferred him to be.
"You've been terribly busy with your work, I suppose. But now that
you've come out once, I suppose we'll see more of you here and
there."</p>

<p>"Well, I hope so," he replied, showing his even teeth.</p>

<p>Her eyes seemed to be saying that she did not believe what she
was saying and that he did not either, but that it was necessary,
possibly amusing, to say something of the sort.</p>

<p>And a related, though somewhat modified, version of this same
type of treatment was accorded him by Stuart, Sondra's brother.</p>

<p>"Oh, how do you do. Glad to know you. My sister has just been
telling me about you. Going to stay in Lycurgus long? Hope you do.
We'll run into one another once in a while then, I suppose."</p>

<p>Clyde was by no means so sure, but he admired the easy, shallow
way in which Stuart laughed and showed his even white teeth&mdash;a
quick, genial, indifferent laugh. Also the way in which he turned
and laid hold of Wynette Phant's white arm as she passed. "Wait a
minute, Wyn. I want to ask you something." He was gone&mdash;into
another room&mdash;bending close to her and talking fast. And Clyde
had noticed that his clothes were perfectly cut.</p>

<p>What a gay world, he thought. What a brisk world. And just then
Jill Trumbull began calling, "Come on, people. It's not my fault.
The cook's mad about something and you're all late anyhow. We'll
get it over with and then dance, eh?"</p>

<p>"You can sit between me and Miss Trumbull when she gets the rest
of us seated," assured Sondra. "Won't that be nice? And now you may
take me in."</p>

<p>She slipped a white arm under Clyde's and he felt as though he
were slowly but surely being transported to paradise.</p>

<h3>Chapter 26</h3>

<p>The dinner itself was chatter about a jumble of places,
personalities, plans, most of which had nothing to do with anything
that Clyde had personally contacted here. However, by reason of his
own charm, he soon managed to overcome the sense of strangeness and
hence indifference in some quarters, more particularly the young
women of the group who were interested by the fact that Sondra
Finchley liked him. And Jill Trumbull, sitting beside him, wanted
to know where he came from, what his own home life and connections
were like, why he had decided to come to Lycurgus, questions which,
interjected as they were between silly banter concerning different
girls and their beaus, gave Clyde pause. He did not feel that he
could admit the truth in connection with his family at all. So he
announced that his father conducted a hotel in Denver&mdash;not so
very large, but still a hotel. Also that he had come to Lycurgus
because his uncle had suggested to him in Chicago that he come to
learn the collar business. He was not sure that he was wholly
interested in it or that he would continue indefinitely unless it
proved worth while; rather he was trying to find out what it might
mean to his future, a remark which caused Sondra, who was also
listening, as well as Jill, to whom it was addressed, to consider
that in spite of all rumors attributed to Gilbert, Clyde must
possess some means and position to which, in case he did not do so
well here, he could return.</p>

<p>This in itself was important, not only to Sondra and Jill, but
to all the others. For, despite his looks and charm and family
connections here, the thought that he was a mere nobody, seeking,
as Constance Wynant had reported, to attach himself to his cousin's
family, was disquieting. One couldn't ever be anything much more
than friendly with a moneyless clerk or pensioner, whatever his
family connections, whereas if he had a little money and some local
station elsewhere, the situation was entirely different.</p>

<p>And now Sondra, relieved by this and the fact that he was
proving more acceptable than she had imagined he would, was
inclined to make more of him than she otherwise would have
done.</p>

<p>"Are you going to let me dance with you after dinner?" was one
of the first things he said to her, infringing on a genial smile
given him in the midst of clatter concerning an approaching dance
somewhere.</p>

<p>"Why, yes, of course, if you want me to," she replied,
coquettishly, seeking to intrigue him into further romanticisms in
regard to her.</p>

<p>"Just one?"</p>

<p>"How many do you want? There are a dozen boys here, you know.
Did you get a program when you came in?"</p>

<p>"I didn't see any."</p>

<p>"Never mind. After dinner you can get one. And you may put me
down for three and eight. That will leave you room for others." She
smiled bewitchingly. "You have to be nice to everybody, you
know."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know." He was still looking at her. "But ever since I
saw you at my uncle's last April, I've been wishing I might see you
again. I always look for your name in the papers."</p>

<p>He looked at her seekingly and questioningly and in spite of
herself, Sondra was captivated by this naive confession. Plainly he
could not afford to go where or do what she did, but still he would
trouble to follow her name and movements in print. She could not
resist the desire to make something more of this.</p>

<p>"Oh, do you?" she added. "Isn't that nice? But what do you read
about me?"</p>

<p>"That you were at Twelfth and Greenwood Lakes and up at Sharon
for the swimming contests. I saw where you went up to Paul Smith's,
too. The papers here seemed to think you were interested in some
one from Schroon Lake and that you might be going to marry
him."</p>

<p>"Oh, did they? How silly. The papers here always say such silly
things." Her tone implied that he might be intruding. He looked
embarrassed. This softened her and after a moment she took up the
conversation in the former vein.</p>

<p>"Do you like to ride?" she asked sweetly and placatively.</p>

<p>"I never have. You know I never had much chance at that, but I
always thought I could if I tried."</p>

<p>"Of course, it's not hard. If you took a lesson or two you
could, and," she added in a somewhat lower tone, "we might go for a
canter sometime. There are lots of horses in our stable that you
would like, I'm sure."</p>

<p>Clyde's hair-roots tingled anticipatorily. He was actually being
invited by Sondra to ride with her sometime and he could use one of
her horses in the bargain.</p>

<p>"Oh, I would love that," he said. "That would be wonderful."</p>

<p>The crowd was getting up from the table. Scarcely any one was
interested in the dinner, because a chamber orchestra of four
having arrived, the strains of a preliminary fox trot were already
issuing from the adjacent living room&mdash;a long, wide affair
from which all obstructing furniture with the exception of wall
chairs had been removed.</p>

<p>"You had better see about your program and your dance before all
the others are gone," cautioned Sondra.</p>

<p>"Yes, I will right away," said Clyde, "but is two all I get with
you?"</p>

<p>"Well, make it three, five and eight then, in the first half."
She waved him gayly away and he hurried for a dance card.</p>

<p>The dances were all of the eager fox-trotting type of the period
with interpolations and variations according to the moods and
temperaments of the individual dancers. Having danced so much with
Roberta during the preceding month, Clyde was in excellent form and
keyed to the breaking point by the thought that at last he was in
social and even affectional contact with a girl as wonderful as
Sondra.</p>

<p>And although wishing to seem courteous and interested in others
with whom he was dancing, he was almost dizzied by passing
contemplations of Sondra. She swayed so droopily and dreamily in
the embrace of Grant Cranston, the while without seeming to,
looking in his direction when he was near, permitting him to sense
how graceful and romantic and poetic was her attitude toward all
things&mdash;what a flower of life she really was. And Nina Temple,
with whom he was now dancing for his benefit, just then observed:
"She is graceful, isn't she?"</p>

<p>"Who?" asked Clyde, pretending an innocence he could not
physically verify, for his cheek and forehead flushed. "I don't
know who you mean."</p>

<p>"Don't you? Then what are you blushing for?"</p>

<p>He had realized that he was blushing. And that his attempted
escape was ridiculous. He turned, but just then the music stopped
and the dancers drifted away to their chairs. Sondra moved off with
Grant Cranston and Clyde led Nina toward a cushioned seat in a
window in the library.</p>

<p>And in connection with Bertine with whom he next danced, he
found himself slightly flustered by the cool, cynical aloofness
with which she accepted and entertained his attention. Her chief
interest in Clyde was the fact that Sondra appeared to find him
interesting.</p>

<p>"You do dance well, don't you? I suppose you must have done a
lot of dancing before you came here&mdash;in Chicago, wasn't it, or
where?"</p>

<p>She talked slowly and indifferently.</p>

<p>"I was in Chicago before I came here, but I didn't do so very
much dancing. I had to work." He was thinking how such girls as she
had everything, as contrasted with girls like Roberta, who had
nothing. And yet, as he now felt in this instance, he liked Roberta
better. She was sweeter and warmer and kinder&mdash;not so
cold.</p>

<p>When the music started again with the sonorous melancholy of a
single saxophone interjected at times, Sondra came over to him and
placed her right hand in his left and allowed him to put his arm
about her waist, an easy, genial and unembarrassed approach which,
in the midst of Clyde's dream of her, was thrilling.</p>

<p>And then in her coquettish and artful way she smiled up in his
eyes, a bland, deceptive and yet seemingly promising smile, which
caused his heart to beat faster and his throat to tighten. Some
delicate perfume that she was using thrilled in his nostrils as
might have the fragrance of spring.</p>

<p>"Having a good time?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;looking at you."</p>

<p>"When there are so many other nice girls to look at?"</p>

<p>"Oh, there are no other girls as nice as you."</p>

<p>"And I dance better than any other girl, and I'm much the
best-looking of any other girl here. Now&mdash;I've said it all for
you. Now what are you going to say?"</p>

<p>She looked up at him teasingly, and Clyde realizing that he had
a very different type to Roberta to deal with, was puzzled and
flushed.</p>

<p>"I see," he said, seriously. "Every fellow tells you that, so
you don't want me to."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, not every fellow." Sondra was at once intrigued and
checkmated by the simplicity of his retort. "There are lots of
people who don't think I'm very pretty."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't they, though?" he returned quite gayly, for at once
he saw that she was not making fun of him. And yet he was almost
afraid to venture another compliment. Instead he cast about for
something else to say, and going back to the conversation at the
table concerning riding and tennis, he now asked: "You like
everything out-of-doors and athletic, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, do I?" was her quick and enthusiastic response. "There
isn't anything I like as much, really. I'm just crazy about riding,
tennis, swimming, motor-boating, aqua-planing. You swim, don't
you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, sure," said Clyde, grandly.</p>

<p>"Do you play tennis?"</p>

<p>"Well, I've just taken it up," he said, fearing to admit that he
did not play at all.</p>

<p>"Oh, I just love tennis. We might play sometime together."
Clyde's spirits were completely restored by this. And tripping as
lightly as dawn to the mournful strains of a popular love song, she
went right on. "Bella Griffiths and Stuart and Grant and I play
fine doubles. We won nearly all the finals at Greenwood and Twelfth
Lake last summer. And when it comes to aqua-planing and high diving
you just ought to see me. We have the swiftest motor-boat up at
Twelfth Lake now&mdash;Stuart has. It can do sixty miles an
hour."</p>

<p>At once Clyde realized that he had hit upon the one subject that
not only fascinated, but even excited her. For not only did it
involve outdoor exercise, in which obviously she reveled, but also
the power to triumph and so achieve laurels in such phases of sport
as most interested those with whom she was socially connected. And
lastly, although this was something which he did not so clearly
realize until later, she was fairly dizzied by the opportunity all
this provided for frequent changes of costume and hence social
show, which was the one thing above all others that did interest
her. How she looked in a bathing suit&mdash;a riding or tennis or
dancing or automobile costume!</p>

<p>They danced on together, thrilled for the moment at least, by
this mutual recognition of the identity and reality of this
interest each felt for the other&mdash;a certain momentary warmth
or enthusiasm which took the form of genial and seeking glances
into each other's eyes, hints on the part of Sondra that, assuming
that Clyde could fit himself athletically, financially and in other
ways for such a world as this, it might be possible that he would
be invited here and there by her; broad and for the moment
self-deluding notions on his part that such could and would be the
case, while in reality just below the surface of his outward or
seeming conviction and assurance ran a deeper current of
self-distrust which showed as a decidedly eager and yet slightly
mournful light in his eye, a certain vigor and assurance in his
voice, which was nevertheless touched, had she been able to define
it, with something that was not assurance by any means.</p>

<p>"Oh, the dance is done," he said sadly.</p>

<p>"Let's try to make them encore," she said, applauding. The
orchestra struck up a lively tune and they glided off together once
more, dipping and swaying here and there&mdash;harmoniously
abandoning themselves to the rhythm of the music&mdash;like two
small chips being tossed about on a rough but friendly sea.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm so glad to be with you again&mdash;to be dancing with
you. It's so wonderful...Sondra."</p>

<p>"But you mustn't call me that, you know. You don't know me well
enough."</p>

<p>"I mean Miss Finchley. But you're not going to be mad at me
again, are you?"</p>

<p>His face was very pale and sad again.</p>

<p>She noticed it.</p>

<p>"No. Was I mad at you? I wasn't really. I like you some...when
you're not sentimental."</p>

<p>The music stopped. The light tripping feet became walking
ones.</p>

<p>"I'd like to see if it's still snowing outside, wouldn't you?"
It was Sondra asking.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. Let's go."</p>

<p>Through the moving couples they hurried out a side-door to a
world that was covered thick with soft, cottony, silent snow. The
air was filled with it silently eddying down.</p>

<h3>Chapter 27</h3>

<p>The ensuing December days brought to Clyde some pleasing and yet
complicating and disturbing developments. For Sondra Finchley,
having found him so agreeable an admirer of hers, was from the
first inclined neither to forget nor neglect him. But, occupying
the rather prominent social position which she did, she was at
first rather dubious as to how to proceed. For Clyde was too poor
and decidedly too much ignored by the Griffiths themselves, even,
for her to risk any marked manifestation of interest in him.</p>

<p>And now, in addition to the primary motivating reason for all
this&mdash; her desire to irritate Gilbert by being friends with
his cousin&mdash; there was another. She liked him. His charm and
his reverence for her and her station flattered and intrigued her.
For hers was a temperament which required adulation in about the
measure which Clyde provided it&mdash;sincere and romantic
adulation. And at the very same time he represented physical as
well as mental attributes which were agreeable to
her&mdash;amorousness without the courage at the time, anyhow, to
annoy her too much; reverence which yet included her as a very
human being; a mental and physical animation which quite matched
and companioned her own.</p>

<p>Hence it was decidedly a troublesome thought with Sondra how she
was to proceed with Clyde without attracting too much attention and
unfavorable comment to herself&mdash;a thought which kept her sly
little brain going at nights after she had retired. However, those
who had met him at the Trumbulls' were so much impressed by her
interest in him that evening and the fact that he had proved so
pleasing and affable, they in turn, the girls particularly, were
satisfied that he was eligible enough.</p>

<p>And in consequence, two weeks later, Clyde, searching for
inexpensive Christmas presents in Stark's for his mother, father,
sisters, brother and Roberta, and encountering Jill Trumbull doing
a little belated shopping herself, was invited by her to attend a
pre-Christmas dance that was to be given the next night by Vanda
Steele at her home in Gloversville. Jill herself was going with
Frank Harriet and she was not sure but that Sondra Finchley would
be there. Another engagement of some kind appeared to be in the
way, but still she was intending to come if she could. But her
sister Gertrude would be glad to have him escort her&mdash;a very
polite way of arranging for Gertrude. Besides, as she knew, if
Sondra heard that Clyde was to be there, this might induce her to
desert her other engagement.</p>

<p>"Tracy will be glad to stop for you in time," she went on,
"or&mdash;" she hesitated&mdash;"perhaps you'd like to come over
for dinner with us before we go. It'll be just the family, but we'd
be delighted to have you. The dancing doesn't begin till
eleven."</p>

<p>The dance was for Friday night, and on that night Clyde had
arranged to be with Roberta because on the following day she was
leaving for a three-day-over-Christmas holiday visit to her
parents&mdash;the longest stretch of time thus far she had spent
away from him. And because, apart from his knowledge she had
arranged to present him with a new fountain pen and Eversharp
pencil, she had been most anxious that he should spend this last
evening with her, a fact which she had impressed upon him. And he,
on his part, had intended to make use of this last evening to
surprise her with a white-and-black toilet set.</p>

<p>But now, so thrilled was he at the possibility of a reencounter
with Sondra, he decided that he would cancel this last evening
engagement with Roberta, although not without some misgivings as to
the difficulty as well as the decency of it. For despite the fact
that he was now so lured by Sondra, nevertheless he was still
deeply interested in Roberta and he did not like to grieve her in
this way. She would look so disappointed, as he knew. Yet at the
same time so flattered and enthused was he by this sudden, if
tardy, social development that he could not now think of refusing
Jill. What? Neglect to visit the Steeles in Gloversville and in
company with the Trumbulls and without any help from the Griffiths,
either? It might be disloyal, cruel, treacherous to Roberta, but
was he not likely to meet Sondra?</p>

<p>In consequence he announced that he would go, but immediately
afterwards decided that he must go round and explain to Roberta,
make some suitable excuse&mdash;that the Griffiths, for instance,
had invited him for dinner. That would be sufficiently overawing
and compelling to her. But upon arriving, and finding her out, he
decided to explain the following morning at the factory&mdash;by
note, if necessary. To make up for it he decided he might promise
to accompany her as far as Fonda on Saturday and give her her
present then.</p>

<p>But on Friday morning at the factory, instead of explaining to
her with the seriousness and even emotional dissatisfaction which
would have governed him before, he now whispered: "I have to break
that engagement to-night, honey. Been invited to my uncle's, and I
have to go. And I'm not sure that I can get around afterwards. I'll
try if I get through in time. But I'll see you on the Fonda car
to-morrow if I don't. I've got something I want to give you, so
don't feel too bad. Just got word this morning or I'd have let you
know. You're not going to feel bad, are you?" He looked at her as
gloomily as possible in order to express his own sorrow over
this.</p>

<p>But Roberta, her presents and her happy last evening with him
put aside in this casual way, and for the first time, too, in this
fashion, shook her head negatively, as if to say "Oh, no," but her
spirits were heavily depressed and she fell to wondering what this
sudden desertion of her at this time might portend. For, up to this
time, Clyde had been attentiveness itself, concealing his recent
contact with Sondra behind a veil of pretended, unmodified
affection which had, as yet, been sufficient to deceive her. It
might be true, as he said, that an unescapable invitation had come
up which necessitated all this. But, oh, the happy evening she had
planned! And now they would not be together again for three whole
days. She grieved dubiously at the factory and in her room
afterwards, thinking that Clyde might at least have suggested
coming around to her room late, after his uncle's dinner in order
that she might give him the presents. But his eventual excuse made
this day was that the dinner was likely to last too late. He could
not be sure. They had talked of going somewhere else
afterwards.</p>

<p>But meanwhile Clyde, having gone to the Trumbulls', and later to
the Steeles', was flattered and reassured by a series of
developments such as a month before he would not have dreamed of
anticipating. For at the Steeles' he was promptly introduced to a
score of personalities there who, finding him chaperoned by the
Trumbulls and learning that he was a Griffiths, as promptly invited
him to affairs of their own&mdash;or hinted at events that were to
come to which he might be invited, so that at the close he found
himself with cordial invitations to attend a New Year's dance at
the Vandams' in Gloversville, as well as a dinner and dance that
was to be given Christmas Eve by the Harriets in Lycurgus, an
affair to which Gilbert and his sister Bella, as well as Sondra,
Bertine and others were invited.</p>

<p>And lastly, there was Sondra herself appearing on the scene at
about midnight in company with Scott Nicholson, Freddie Sells and
Bertine, at first pretending to be wholly unaware of his presence,
yet deigning at last to greet him with an, "Oh, hello, I didn't
expect to find you here." She was draped most alluringly in a deep
red Spanish shawl. But Clyde could sense from the first that she
was quite aware of his presence, and at the first available
opportunity he drew near to her and asked yearningly, "Aren't you
going to dance with me at all?"</p>

<p>"Why, of course, if you want me to. I thought maybe you had
forgotten me by now," she said mockingly.</p>

<p>"As though I'd be likely to forget you. The only reason I'm here
to-night is because I thought I might see you again. I haven't
thought of any one or anything else since I saw you last."</p>

<p>Indeed so infatuated was he with her ways and airs, that instead
of being irritated by her pretended indifference, he was all the
more attracted. And he now achieved an intensity which to her was
quite compelling. His eyelids narrowed and his eyes lit with a
blazing desire which was quite disturbing to see.</p>

<p>"My, but you can say the nicest things in the nicest way when
you want to." She was toying with a large Spanish comb in her hair
for the moment and smiling. "And you say them just as though you
meant them."</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say that you don't believe me, Sondra," he
inquired almost feverishly, this second use of her name thrilling
her now as much as it did him. Although inclined to frown on so
marked a presumption in his case, she let it pass because it was
pleasing to her.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I do. Of course," she said a little dubiously, and for
the first time nervously, where he was concerned. She was beginning
to find it a little hard to decipher her proper line of conduct in
connection with him, whether to repress him more or less. "But you
must say now what dance you want. I see some one coming for me."
And she held her small program up to him archly and intriguingly.
"You may have the eleventh. That's the next after this."</p>

<p>"Is that all?"</p>

<p>"Well, and the fourteenth, then, greedy," she laughed into
Clyde's eyes, a laughing look which quite enslaved him.</p>

<p>Subsequently learning from Frank Harriet in the course of a
dance that Clyde had been invited to his house for Christmas Eve,
as well as that Jessica Phant had invited him to Utica for New
Year's Eve, she at once conceived of him as slated for real success
and decided that he was likely to prove less of a social burden
than she had feared. He was charming&mdash;there was no doubt of
it. And he was so devoted to her. In consequence, as she now
decided, it might be entirely possible that some of these other
girls, seeing him recognized by some of the best people here and
elsewhere, would become sufficiently interested, or drawn to him
even, to wish to overcome his devotion to her. Being of a vain and
presumptuous disposition herself, she decided that that should not
be. Hence, in the course of her second dance with Clyde, she said:
"You've been invited to the Harriets' for Christmas Eve, haven't
you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and I owe it all to you, too," he exclaimed warmly. "Are
you going to be there?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm awfully sorry. I am invited and I wish now that I was
going. But you know I arranged some time ago to go over to Albany
and then up to Saratoga for the holidays. I'm going to-morrow, but
I'll be back before New Year's. Some friends of Freddie's are
giving a big affair over in Schenectady New Year's Eve, though. And
your cousin Bella and my brother Stuart and Grant and Bertine are
going. If you'd like to go, you might go along with us over
there."</p>

<p>She had been about to say "me," but had changed it to "us." She
was thinking that this would certainly demonstrate her control over
him to all those others, seeing that it nullified Miss Phant's
invitation. And at once Clyde accepted, and with delight, since it
would bring him in contact with her again.</p>

<p>At the same time he was astonished and almost aghast over the
fact that in this casual and yet very intimate and definite way she
was planning for him to reencounter Bella, who would at once carry
the news of his going with her and these others to her family. And
what would not that spell, seeing that even as yet the Griffiths
had not invited him anywhere&mdash;not even for Christmas? For
although the fact of Clyde having been picked up by Sondra in her
car as well as later, that he had been invited to the Now and Then,
had come to their ears, still nothing had been done. Gilbert
Griffiths was wroth, his father and mother puzzled as to their
proper course but remaining inactive nonetheless.</p>

<p>But the group, according to Sondra, might remain in Schenectady
until the following morning, a fact which she did not trouble to
explain to Clyde at first. And by now he had forgotten that
Roberta, having returned from her long stay at Biltz by then, and
having been deserted by him over Christmas, would most assuredly be
expecting him to spend New Year's Eve with her. That was a
complication which was to dawn later. Now he only saw bliss in
Sandra's thought of him and at once eagerly and enthusiastically
agreed.</p>

<p>"But you know," she said cautiously, "you mustn't pay so very
much attention to me over there or here or anywhere or think
anything of it, if I don't to you. I may not be able to see so very
much of you if you do. I'll tell you about that sometime. You see
my father and mother are funny people. And so are some of my
friends here. But if you'll just be nice and sort of
indifferent&mdash;you know&mdash;I may be able to see quite a
little of you this winter yet. Do you see?"</p>

<p>Thrilled beyond words by this confession, which came because of
his too ardent approaches as he well knew, he looked at her eagerly
and searchingly.</p>

<p>"But you care for me a little, then, don't you?" he
half-demanded, half-pleaded, his eyes lit with that alluring light
which so fascinated her. And cautious and yet attracted, swayed
sensually and emotionally and yet dubious as to the wisdom of her
course, Sondra replied: "Well, I'll tell you. I do and I don't.
That is, I can't tell yet. I like you a lot. Sometimes I think I
like you more than others. You see we don't know each other very
well yet. But you'll come with me to Schenectady, though, won't
you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, will I?"</p>

<p>"I'll write you more about that, or call you up. You have a
telephone, haven't you?"</p>

<p>He gave her the number.</p>

<p>"And if by any chance there's any change or I have to break the
engagement, don't think anything of it. I'll see you later&mdash;
somewhere, sure." She smiled and Clyde felt as though he were
choking. The mere thought of her being so frank with him, and
saying that she cared for him a lot, at times, was sufficient to
cause him to almost reel with joy. To think that this beautiful
girl was so anxious to include him in her life if she
could&mdash;this wonderful girl who was surrounded by so many
friends and admirers from which she could take her pick.</p>

<h3>Chapter 28</h3>

<p>Six-thirty the following morning. And Clyde, after but a single
hour's rest after his return from Gloversville, rising, his mind
full of mixed and troubled thoughts as to how to readjust his
affairs in connection with Roberta. She was going to Biltz to-day.
He had promised to go as far as Fonda. But now he did not want to
go. Of course he would have to concoct some excuse. But what?</p>

<p>Fortunately the day before he had heard Whiggam tell Liggett
there was to be a meeting of department heads after closing hours
in Smillie's office to-day, and that he was to be there. Nothing
was said to Clyde, since his department was included in Liggett's,
but now he decided that he could offer this as a reason and
accordingly, about an hour before noon, he dropped a note on her
desk which read:</p>

<blockquote>"HONEY: Awfully sorry, but just told that I have to be
at a meeting of department heads downstairs at three. That means I
can't go to Fonda with you, but will drop around to the room for a
few minutes right after closing. Have something I want to give you,
so be sure and wait. But don't feel too bad. It can't be helped.
See you sure when you come back Wednesday.<br>
<br>
"CLYDE."</blockquote>

<p>At first, since she could not read it at once, Roberta was
pleased because she imagined it contained some further favorable
word about the afternoon. But on opening it in the ladies' rest
room a few minutes afterwards, her face fell. Coupled as this was
with the disappointment of the preceding evening, when Clyde had
failed to appear, together with his manner of the morning which to
her had seemed self-absorbed, if not exactly distant, she began to
wonder what it was that was bringing about this sudden change.
Perhaps he could not avoid attending a meeting any more than he
could avoid going to his uncle's when he was asked. But the day
before, following his word to her that he could not be with her
that evening, his manner was gayer, less sober, than his supposed
affection in the face of her departure would warrant. After all he
had known before that she was to be gone for three days. He also
knew that nothing weighed on her more than being absent from him
any length of time.</p>

<p>At once her mood from one of hopefulness changed to one of deep
depression&mdash;the blues. Life was always doing things like this
to her. Here it was&mdash;two days before Christmas, and now she
would have to go to Biltz, where there was nothing much but such
cheer as she could bring, and all by herself, and after scarcely a
moment with him. She returned to her bench, her face showing all
the unhappiness that had suddenly overtaken her. Her manner was
listless and her movements indifferent&mdash;a change which Clyde
noticed; but still, because of his sudden and desperate feeling for
Sondra, he could not now bring himself to repent.</p>

<p>At one, the giant whistles of some of the neighboring factories
sounding the Saturday closing hours, both he and Roberta betook
themselves separately to her room. And he was thinking to himself
as he went what to say now. What to do? How in the face of this
suddenly frosted and blanched affection to pretend an interest he
did not feel&mdash;how, indeed, continue with a relationship which
now, as alive and vigorous as it might have been as little as
fifteen days before, appeared exceedingly anemic and colorless. It
would not do to say or indicate in any way that he did not care for
her any more&mdash;for that would be so decidedly cruel and might
cause Roberta to say what? Do what? And on the other hand, neither
would it do, in the face of his longings and prospects in the
direction of Sondra to continue in a type of approach and
declaration that was not true or sound and that could only tend to
maintain things as they were. Impossible! Besides, at the first
hint of reciprocal love on the part of Sondra, would he not be
anxious and determined to desert Roberta if he could? And why not?
As contrasted with one of Sondra's position and beauty, what had
Roberta really to offer him? And would it be fair in one of her
station and considering the connections and the possibilities that
Sondra offered, for her to demand or assume that he should continue
a deep and undivided interest in her as opposed to this other? That
would not really be fair, would it?</p>

<p>It was thus that he continued to speculate while Roberta,
preceding him to her room, was asking herself what was this now
that had so suddenly come upon her&mdash;over Clyde&mdash;this
sudden indifference, this willingness to break a pre-Christmas
date, and when she was about to leave for home and not to see him
for three days and over Christmas, too, to make him not wish to
ride with her even so far as Fonda. He might say that it was that
meeting, but was it? She could have waited until four if necessary,
but something in his manner had precluded that&mdash;something
distant and evasive. Oh, what did this all mean? And, so soon after
the establishing of this intimacy, which at first and up to now at
least had seemed to be drawing them indivisibly together. Did it
spell a change&mdash;danger to or the end even of their wonderful
love dream? Oh, dear! And she had given him so much and now his
loyalty meant everything&mdash;her future&mdash;her life.</p>

<p>She stood in her room pondering this new problem as Clyde
arrived, his Christmas package under his arm, but still fixed in
his determination to modify his present relationship with Roberta,
if he could&mdash;yet, at the same time anxious to put as
inconsequential a face on the proceeding as possible.</p>

<p>"Gee, I'm awfully sorry about this, Bert," he began briskly, his
manner a mixture of attempted gayety, sympathy and uncertainty. "I
hadn't an idea until about a couple of hours ago that they were
going to have this meeting. But you know how it is. You just can't
get out of a thing like this. You're not going to feel too bad, are
you?" For already, from her expression at the factory as well as
here, he had gathered that her mood was of the darkest. "I'm glad I
got the chance to bring this around to you, though," he added,
handing the gift to her. "I meant to bring it around last night
only that other business came up. Gee, I'm sorry about the whole
thing. Really, I am."</p>

<p>Delighted as she might have been the night before if this gift
had been given to her, Roberta now put the box on the table, all
the zest that might have been joined with it completely
banished.</p>

<p>"Did you have a good time last night, dear?" she queried,
curious as to the outcome of the event that had robbed her of
him.</p>

<p>"Oh, pretty good," returned Clyde, anxious to put as deceptive a
face as possible on the night that had meant so much to him and
spelled so much danger to her. "I thought I was just going over to
my uncle's for dinner like I told you. But after I got there I
found that what they really wanted me for was to escort Bella and
Myra over to some doings in Gloversvile. There's a rich family over
there, the Steeles&mdash;big glove people, you know. Well, anyhow,
they were giving a dance and they wanted me to take them over
because Gil couldn't go. But it wasn't so very interesting. I was
glad when it was all over." He used the names Bella, Myra and
Gilbert as though they were long and assured intimates of
his&mdash;an intimacy which invariably impressed Roberta
greatly.</p>

<p>"You didn't get through in time then to come around here, did
you?"</p>

<p>"No, I didn't, 'cause I had to wait for the bunch to come back.
I just couldn't get away. But aren't you going to open your
present?" he added, anxious to divert her thoughts from this
desertion which he knew was preying on her mind.</p>

<p>She began to untie the ribbon that bound his gift, at the same
time that her mind was riveted by the possibilities of the party
which he had felt called upon to mention. What girls beside Bella
and Myra had been there? Was there by any chance any girl outside
of herself in whom he might have become recently interested? He was
always talking about Sondra Finchley, Bertine Cranston and Jill
Trumbull. Were they, by any chance, at this party?</p>

<p>"Who all were over there beside your cousins?" she suddenly
asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, a lot of people that you don't know. Twenty or thirty from
different places around here."</p>

<p>"Any others from Lycurgus beside your cousins?" she
persisted.</p>

<p>"Oh, a few. We picked up Jill Trumbull and her sister, because
Bella wanted to. Arabella Stark and Perley Haynes were already over
there when we got there." He made no mention of Sondra or any of
the others who so interested him.</p>

<p>But because of the manner in saying it&mdash;something in the
tone of his voice and flick of his eyes, the answer did not satisfy
Roberta. She was really intensely troubled by this new development,
but did not feel that under the circumstances it was wise to
importune Clyde too much. He might resent it. After all he had
always been identified with this world since ever she had known
him. And she did not want him to feel that she was attempting to
assert any claims over him, though such was her true desire.</p>

<p>"I wanted so much to be with you last night to give you your
present," she returned instead, as much to divert her own thoughts
as to appeal to his regard for her. Clyde sensed the sorrow in her
voice and as of old it appealed to him, only now he could not and
would not let it take hold of him as much as otherwise it might
have.</p>

<p>"But you know how that was, Bert," he replied, with almost an
air of bravado. "I just told you."</p>

<p>"I know," she replied sadly and attempting to conceal the true
mood that was dominating her. At the same time she was removing the
paper and opening the lid to the case that contained her toilet
set. And once opened, her mood changed slightly because never
before had she possessed anything so valuable or original. "Oh,
this is beautiful, isn't it?" she exclaimed, interested for the
moment in spite of herself. "I didn't expect anything like this. My
two little presents won't seem like very much now."</p>

<p>She crossed over at once to get her gifts. Yet Clyde could see
that although his gift was exceptional, still it was not sufficient
to overcome the depression which his indifference had brought upon
her. His continued love was far more vital than any present.</p>

<p>"You like it, do you?" he asked, eagerly hoping against hope
that it would serve to divert her.</p>

<p>"Of course, dear," she replied, looking at it interestedly. "But
mine won't seem so much," she added gloomily, and not a little
depressed by the general outcome of all her plans. "But they'll be
useful to you and you'll always have them near you, next your
heart, where I want them to be."</p>

<p>She handed over the small box which contained the metal
Eversharp pencil and the silver ornamental fountain pen she had
chosen for him because she fancied they would be useful to him in
his work at the factory. Two weeks before he would have taken her
in his arms and sought to console her for the misery he was now
causing her. But now he merely stood there wondering how, without
seeming too distant, he could assuage her and yet not enter upon
the customary demonstrations. And in order so to do he burst into
enthusiastic and yet somehow hollow words in regard to her present
to him.</p>

<p>"Oh, gee, these are swell, honey, and just what I need. You
certainly couldn't have given me anything that would come in
handier. I can use them all the time." He appeared to examine them
with the utmost pleasure and afterwards fastened them in his pocket
ready for use. Also, because for the moment she was before him so
downcast and wistful, epitomizing really all the lure of the old
relationship, he put his arms around her and kissed her. She was
winsome, no doubt of it. And then when she threw her arms around
his neck and burst into tears, he held her close, saying that there
was no cause for all this and that she would be back Wednesday and
all would be as before. At the same time he was thinking that this
was not true, and how strange that was&mdash;seeing that only so
recently he had cared for her so much. It was amazing how another
girl could divert him in this way. And yet so it was. And although
she might be thinking that he was still caring for her as he did
before, he was not and never would again. And because of this he
felt really sorry for her.</p>

<p>Something of this latest mood in him reached Roberta now, even
as she listened to his words and felt his caresses. They failed to
convey sincerity. His manner was too restless, his embraces too
apathetic, his tone without real tenderness. Further proof as to
this was added when, after a moment or two, he sought to disengage
himself and look at his watch, saying, "I guess I'll have to be
going now, honey. It's twenty of three now and that meeting is for
three. I wish I could ride over with you, but I'll see you when you
get back."</p>

<p>He bent down to kiss her but with Roberta sensing once and for
all, this time, that his mood in regard to her was different,
colder. He was interested and kind, but his thoughts were
elsewhere&mdash;and at this particular season of the year,
too&mdash;of all times. She tried to gather her strength and her
self-respect together and did, in part&mdash;saying rather coolly,
and determinedly toward the last: "Well, I don't want you to be
late, Clyde. You better hurry. But I don't want to stay over there
either later than Christmas night. Do you suppose if I come back
early Christmas afternoon, you will come over here at all? I don't
want to be late Wednesday for work."</p>

<p>"Why, sure, of course, honey, I'll be around," replied Clyde
genially and even wholeheartedly, seeing that he had nothing else
scheduled, that he knew of, for then, and would not so soon and
boldly seek to evade her in this fashion. "What time do you expect
to get in?"</p>

<p>The hour was to be eight and he decided that for that occasion,
anyhow, a reunion would be acceptable. He drew out his watch again
and saying, "I'll have to be going now, though," moved toward the
door.</p>

<p>Nervous as to the significance of all this and concerned about
the future, she now went over to him and seizing his coat lapels
and looking into his eyes, half-pleaded and half-demanded: "Now,
this is sure for Christmas night, is it, Clyde? You won't make any
other engagement this time, will you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, don't worry. You know me. You know I couldn't help that
other, honey, but I'll be on hand Tuesday, sure," he returned. And
kissing her, he hurried out, feeling, perhaps, that he was not
acting as wisely as he should, but not seeing clearly how otherwise
he was to do. A man couldn't break off with a girl as he was trying
to do, or at least might want to, without exercising some little
tact or diplomacy, could he? There was no sense in that nor any
real skill, was there? There must be some other and better way than
that, surely. At the same time his thoughts were already running
forward to Sondra and New Year's Eve. He was going with her to
Schenectady to a party and then he would have a chance to judge
whether she was caring for him as much as she had seemed to the
night before.</p>

<p>After he had gone, Roberta turned in a rather lorn and weary way
and looked out the window after him, wondering as to what her
future with him was to be, if at all? Supposing now, for any
reason, he should cease caring for her. She had given him so much.
And her future was now dependent upon him, his continued regard.
Was he going to get tired of her now&mdash;not want to see her any
more? Oh, how terrible that would be. What would she&mdash;what
could she do then? If only she had not given herself to him,
yielded so easily and so soon upon his demand.</p>

<p>She gazed out of her window at the bare snow-powdered branches
of the trees outside and sighed. The holidays! And going away like
this. Oh! Besides he was so high placed in this local society. And
there were so many things brighter and better than she could offer
calling him.</p>

<p>She shook her head dubiously, surveyed her face in the mirror,
put together the few presents and belongings which she was taking
with her to her home, and departed.</p>

<h3>Chapter 29</h3>

<p>Biltz and the fungoid farm land after Clyde and Lycurgus was
depressing enough to Roberta, for all there was too closely
identified with deprivations and repressions which discolor the
normal emotions centering about old scenes.</p>

<p>As she stepped down from the train at the drab and aged chalet
which did service for a station, she observed her father in the
same old winter overcoat he had worn for a dozen years, waiting for
her with the old family conveyance, a decrepit but still whole
buggy and a horse as bony and weary as himself. He had, as she had
always thought, the look of a tired and defeated man. His face
brightened when he saw Roberta, for she had always been his
favorite child, and he chatted quite cheerfully as she climbed in
alongside of him and they turned around and started toward the road
that led to the farmhouse, a rough and winding affair of dirt at a
time when excellent automobile roads were a commonplace
elsewhere.</p>

<p>As they rode along Roberta found herself checking off mentally
every tree, curve, landmark with which she had been familiar. But
with no happy thoughts. It was all too drab. The farm itself,
coupled with the chronic illness and inefficiency of Titus and the
inability of the youngest boy Tom or her mother to help much, was
as big a burden as ever. A mortgage of $2000 that had been placed
on it years before had never been paid off, the north chimney was
still impaired, the steps were sagging even more than ever and the
walls and fences and outlying buildings were no
different&mdash;save to be made picturesque now by the snows of
winter covering them. Even the furniture remained the same jumble
that it had always been. And there were her mother and younger
sister and brother, who knew nothing of her true relationship to
Clyde&mdash;a mere name his here&mdash; and assuming that she was
wholeheartedly delighted to be back with them once more. Yet
because of what she knew of her own life and Clyde's uncertain
attitude toward her, she was now, if anything, more depressed than
before.</p>

<p>Indeed, the fact that despite her seeming recent success she had
really compromised herself in such a way that unless through
marriage with Clyde she was able to readjust herself to the moral
level which her parents understood and approved, she, instead of
being the emissary of a slowly and modestly improving social
condition for all, might be looked upon as one who had reduced it
to a lower level still&mdash;its destroyer&mdash;was sufficient to
depress and reduce her even more. A very depressing and searing
thought.</p>

<p>Worse and more painful still was the thought in connection with
all this that, by reason of the illusions which from the first had
dominated her in connection with Clyde, she had not been able to
make a confidant of her mother or any one else in regard to him.
For she was dubious as to whether her mother would not consider
that her aspirations were a bit high. And she might ask questions
in regard to him and herself which might prove embarrassing. At the
same time, unless she had some confidant in whom she could truly
trust, all her troublesome doubts in regard to herself and Clyde
must remain a secret.</p>

<p>After talking for a few moments with Tom and Emily, she went
into the kitchen where her mother was busy with various Christmas
preparations. Her thought was to pave the way with some
observations of her own in regard to the farm here and her life at
Lycurgus, but as she entered, her mother looked up to say: "How
does it feel, Bob, to come back to the country? I suppose it all
looks rather poor compared to Lycurgus," she added a little
wistfully.</p>

<p>Roberta could tell from the tone of her mother's voice and the
rather admiring look she cast upon her that she was thinking of her
as one who had vastly improved her state. At once she went over to
her and, putting her arms about her affectionately, exclaimed: "Oh,
Mamma, wherever you are is just the nicest place. Don't you know
that?"</p>

<p>For answer her mother merely looked at her with affectionate and
well-wishing eyes and patted her on the back. "Well, Bobbie," she
added, quietly, "you know how you are about me."</p>

<p>Something in her mother's voice which epitomized the long years
of affectionate understanding between them&mdash;an understanding
based, not only on a mutual desire for each other's happiness, but
a complete frankness in regard to all emotions and moods which had
hitherto dominated both&mdash;touched her almost to the point of
tears. Her throat tightened and her eyes moistened, although she
sought to overcome any show of emotion whatsoever. She longed to
tell her everything. At the same time the compelling passion she
retained for Clyde, as well as the fact that she had compromised
herself as she had, now showed her that she had erected a barrier
which could not easily be torn down. The conventions of this local
world were much too strong&mdash;even where her mother was
concerned.</p>

<p>She hesitated a moment, wishing that she could quickly and
clearly present to her mother the problem that was weighing upon
her and receive her sympathy, if not help. But instead she merely
said: "Oh, I wish you could have been with me all the time in
Lycurgus, Mamma. Maybe&mdash;" She paused, realizing that she had
been on the verge of speaking without due caution. Her thought was
that with her mother near at hand she might have been able to have
resisted Clyde's insistent desires.</p>

<p>"Yes, I suppose you do miss me," her mother went on, "but it's
better for you, don't you think? You know how it is over here, and
you like your work. You do like your work, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, the work is nice enough. I like that part of it. It's been
so nice to be able to help here a little, but it's not so nice
living all alone."</p>

<p>"Why did you leave the Newtons, Bob? Was Grace so disagreeable?
I should have thought she would have been company for you."</p>

<p>"Oh, she was at first," replied Roberta. "Only she didn't have
any men friends of her own, and she was awfully jealous of anybody
that paid the least attention to me. I couldn't go anywhere but she
had to go along, or if it wasn't that then she always wanted me to
be with her, so I couldn't go anywhere by myself. You know how it
is, Mamma. Two girls can't go with one young man."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know how it is, Bob." Her mother laughed a little, then
added: "Who is he?"</p>

<p>"It's Mr. Griffiths, Mother," she added, after a moment's
hesitation, a sense of the exceptional nature of her contact as
contrasted with this very plain world here passing like a light
across her eyes. For all her fears, even the bare possibility of
joining her life with Clyde's was marvelous. "But I don't want you
to mention his name to anybody yet," she added. "He doesn't want me
to. His relatives are so very rich, you know. They own the
company&mdash;that is, his uncle does. But there's a rule there
about any one who works for the company&mdash;any one in charge of
a department. I mean not having anything to do with any of the
girls. And he wouldn't with any of the others. But he likes
me&mdash; and I like him, and it's different with us. Besides I'm
going to resign pretty soon and get a place somewhere else, I
think, and then it won't make any difference. I can tell anybody,
and so can he."</p>

<p>Roberta was thinking now that, in the face of her recent
treatment at the hands of Clyde, as well as because of the way in
which she had given herself to him without due precaution as to her
ultimate rehabilitation via marriage, that perhaps this was not
exactly true. He might not&mdash;a vague, almost formless, fear
this, as yet&mdash; want her to tell anybody now&mdash;ever. And
unless he were going to continue to love her and marry her, she
might not want any one to know of it, either. The wretched,
shameful, difficult position in which she had placed herself by all
this.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Mrs. Alden, learning thus casually of the odd
and seemingly clandestine nature of this relationship, was not only
troubled but puzzled, so concerned was she for Roberta's happiness.
For, although, as she now said to herself, Roberta was such a good,
pure and careful girl&mdash;the best and most unselfish and wisest
of all her children&mdash;still might it not be possible&mdash;?
But, no, no one was likely to either easily or safely compromise or
betray Roberta. She was too conservative and good, and so now she
added: "A relative of the owner, you say&mdash;the Mr. Samuel
Griffiths you wrote about?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Mamma. He's his nephew."</p>

<p>"The young man at the factory?" her mother asked, at the same
time wondering just how Roberta had come to attract a man of
Clyde's position, for, from the very first she had made it plain
that he was a member of the family who owned the factory. This in
itself was a troublesome fact. The traditional result of such
relationships, common the world over, naturally caused her to be
intensely fearful of just such an association as Roberta seemed to
be making. Nevertheless she was not at all convinced that a girl of
Roberta's looks and practicality would not be able to negotiate an
association of the sort without harm to herself.</p>

<p>"Yes," Roberta replied simply.</p>

<p>"What's he like, Bob?"</p>

<p>"Oh, awfully nice. So good-looking, and he's been so nice to me.
I don't think the place would be as nice as it is except that he is
so refined, he keeps those factory girls in their place. He's a
nephew of the president of the company, you see, and the girls just
naturally have to respect him."</p>

<p>"Well, that <i>is</i> nice, isn't it? I think it's so much
better to work for refined people than just anybody. I know you
didn't think so much of the work over at Trippetts Mills. Does he
come to see you often, Bob?"</p>

<p>"Well, yes, pretty often," Roberta replied, flushing slightly,
for she realized that she could not be entirely frank with her
mother.</p>

<p>Mrs. Alden, looking up at the moment, noticed this, and,
mistaking it for embarrassment, asked teasingly: "You like him,
don't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I do, Mother," Roberta replied, simply and honestly.</p>

<p>"What about him? Does he like you?"</p>

<p>Roberta crossed to the kitchen window. Below it at the base of
the slope which led to the springhouse, and the one most productive
field of the farm, were ranged all the dilapidated buildings which
more than anything else about the place bespoke the meager material
condition to which the family had fallen. In fact, during the last
ten years these things had become symbols of inefficiency and lack.
Somehow at this moment, bleak and covered with snow, they
identified themselves in her mind as the antithesis of all to which
her imagination aspired. And, not strangely either, the last was
identified with Clyde. Somberness as opposed to
happiness&mdash;success in love or failure in love. Assuming that
he truly loved her now and would take her away from all this, then
possibly the bleakness of it all for her and her mother would be
broken. But assuming that he did not, then all the results of her
yearning, but possibly mistaken, dreams would be not only upon her
own head, but upon those of these others, her mother's first. She
troubled what to say, but finally observed: "Well, he says he
does."</p>

<p>"Do you think he intends to marry you?" Mrs. Alden asked,
timidly and hopefully, because of all her children her heart and
hopes rested most with Roberta.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll tell you, Mamma..." The sentence was not finished,
for just then Emily, hurrying in from the front door, called: "Oh,
Gifs here. He came in an automobile. Somebody drove him over, I
guess, and he's got four or five big bundles."</p>

<p>And immediately after came Tom with the elder brother, who, in a
new overcoat, the first result of his career with the General
Electric Company in Schenectady, greeted his mother affectionately,
and after her, Roberta.</p>

<p>"Why, Gifford," his mother exclaimed. "We didn't expect you
until the nine o'clock. How did you get here so soon?"</p>

<p>"Well, I didn't think I would be. I ran into Mr. Rearick down in
Schenectady and he wanted to know if I didn't want to drive back
with him. I see old Pop Myers over at Trippetts Mills has got the
second story to his house at last, Bob," he turned and added to
Roberta: "I suppose it'll be another year before he gets the roof
on."</p>

<p>"I suppose so," replied Roberta, who knew the old Trippetts
Mills character well. In the meantime she had relieved him of his
coat and packages which, piled on the dining-room table, were being
curiously eyed by Emily.</p>

<p>"Hands off, Em!" called Gifford to his little sister. "Nothing
doing with those until Christmas morning. Has anybody cut a
Christmas tree yet? That was my job last year."</p>

<p>"It still is, Gifford," his mother replied. "I told Tom to wait
until you came, 'cause you always get such a good one."</p>

<p>And just then through the kitchen door Titus entered, bearing an
armload of wood, his gaunt face and angular elbows and knees
contributing a sharp contrast to the comparative hopefulness of the
younger generation. Roberta noticed it as he stood smiling upon his
son, and, because she was so eager for something better than ever
had been to come to all, now went over to her father and put her
arms around him. "I know something Santy has brought my Dad that
he'll like." It was a dark red plaid mackinaw that she was sure
would keep him warm while executing his chores about the house, and
she was anxious for Christmas morning to come so that he could see
it.</p>

<p>She then went to get an apron in order to help her mother with
the evening meal. No additional moment for complete privacy
occurring, the opportunity to say more concerning that which both
were so interested in&mdash;the subject of Clyde&mdash;did not come
up again for several hours, after which length of time she found
occasion to say: "Yes, but you mustn't ever say anything to anybody
yet. I told him I wouldn't tell, and you mustn't."</p>

<p>"No, I won't, dear. But I was just wondering. But I suppose you
know what you're doing. You're old enough now to take care of
yourself, Bob, aren't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I am, Ma. And you mustn't worry about me, dear," she
added, seeing a shadow, not of distrust but worry, passing over her
beloved mother's face. How careful she must be not to cause her to
worry when she had so much else to think about here on the
farm.</p>

<p>Sunday morning brought the Gabels with full news of their social
and material progress in Homer. Although her sister was not as
attractive as she, and Fred Gabel was not such a man as at any
stage in her life Roberta could have imagined herself interested
in, still, after her troublesome thoughts in regard to Clyde, the
sight of Agnes emotionally and materially content and at ease in
the small security which matrimony and her none-too-efficient
husband provided, was sufficient to rouse in her that flapping,
doubtful mood that had been assailing her since the previous
morning. Was it not better, she thought, to be married to a man
even as inefficient and unattractive but steadfast as Fred Gabel,
than to occupy the anomalous position in which she now found
herself in her relations with Clyde? For here was Gabel now talking
briskly of the improvements that had come to himself and Agnes
during the year in which they had been married. In that time he had
been able to resign his position as teacher in Homer and take over
on shares the management of a small book and stationery store whose
principal contributory features were a toy department and soda
fountain. They had been doing a good business. Agnes, if all went
well, would be able to buy a mission parlor suite by next summer.
Fred had already bought her a phonograph for Christmas. In proof of
their well-being, they had brought satisfactory remembrances for
all of the Aldens.</p>

<p>But Gabel had with him a copy of the Lycurgus Star, and at
breakfast, which because of the visitors this morning was unusually
late, was reading the news of that city, for in Lycurgus was
located the wholesale house from which he secured a portion of his
stock.</p>

<p>"Well, I see things are going full blast in your town, Bob," he
observed. "The Star here says the Griffiths Company have got an
order for 120,000 collars from the Buffalo trade alone. They must
be just coining money over there."</p>

<p>"There's always plenty to do in my department, I know that,"
replied Roberta, briskly. "We never seem to have any the less to do
whether business is good or bad. I guess it must be good all the
time."</p>

<p>"Pretty soft for those people. They don't have to worry about
anything. Some one was telling me they're going to build a new
factory in Ilion to manufacture shirts alone. Heard anything about
that down there?"</p>

<p>"Why, no, I haven't. Maybe it's some other company."</p>

<p>"By the way, what's the name of that young man you said was the
head of your department? Wasn't he a Griffiths, too?" he asked
briskly, turning to the editorial page, which also carried news of
local Lycurgus society.</p>

<p>"Yes, his name is Griffiths&mdash;Clyde Griffiths. Why?"</p>

<p>"I think I saw his name in here a minute ago. I just wanted to
see if it ain't the same fellow. Sure, here you are. Ain't this the
one?" He passed the paper to Roberta with his finger on an item
which read:</p>

<blockquote>"Miss Vanda Steele, of Gloversville, was hostess at an
informal dance held at her home in that city Friday night, at which
were present several prominent members of Lycurgus society, among
them the Misses Sondra Finchiey, Bertine Cranston, Jill and
Gertrude Trumbull and Perley Haynes, and Messrs. Clyde Griffiths,
Frank Harriet, Tracy Trumbull, Grant Cranston and Scott Nicholson.
The party, as is usual whenever the younger group assembles, did
not break up until late, the Lycurgus members motoring back just
before dawn. It is already rumored that most of this group will
gather at the Ellerslies', in Schenectady, New Year's Eve for
another event of this same gay nature."</blockquote>

<p>"He seems to be quite a fellow over there," Gabel remarked, even
as Roberta was reading.</p>

<p>The first thing that occurred to Roberta on reading this item
was that it appeared to have little, if anything, to do with the
group which Clyde had said was present. In the first place there
was no mention of Myra or Bella Griffiths. On the other hand, all
those names with which, because of recent frequent references on
the part of Clyde, she was becoming most familiar were recorded as
present. Sondra Finchley, Bertine Cranston, the Trumbull girls,
Perley Haynes. He had said it had not been very interesting, and
here it was spoken of as gay and he himself was listed for another
engagement of the same character New Year's Eve, when, as a matter
of fact, she had been counting on being with him. He had not even
mentioned this New Year's engagement. And perhaps he would now make
some last minute excuse for that, as he had for the previous Friday
evening. Oh, dear! What did all this mean, anyhow!</p>

<p>Immediately what little romantic glamour this Christmas
homecoming had held for her was dissipated. She began to wonder
whether Clyde really cared for her as he had pretended. The dark
state to which her incurable passion for him had brought her now
pained her terribly. For without him and marriage and a home and
children, and a reasonable place in such a local world as she was
accustomed to, what was there for a girl like her in the world? And
apart from his own continuing affection for her&mdash;if it was
really continuing, what assurance had she, in the face of such
incidents as these, that he would not eventually desert her? And if
this was true, here was her future, in so far as marriage with any
one else was concerned, compromised or made impossible, maybe, and
with no reliance to be placed on him.</p>

<p>She fell absolutely silent. And although Gabel inquired: "That's
the fellow, isn't it?" she arose without answering and said:
"Excuse me, please, a moment. I want to get something out of my
bag," and hurried once more to her former room upstairs. Once there
she sat down on the bed, and, resting her chin in her hands, a
habit when troublesome or necessary thoughts controlled her, gazed
at the floor.</p>

<p>Where was Clyde now?</p>

<p>What one, if any, of those girls did he take to the Steele
party? Was he very much interested in her? Until this very day,
because of Clyde's unbroken devotion to her, she had not even
troubled to think there could be any other girl to whom his
attentions could mean anything.</p>

<p>But now&mdash;now!</p>

<p>She got up and walked to the window and looked out on that same
orchard where as a girl so many times she had been thrilled by the
beauty of life. The scene was miserably bleak and bare. The thin,
icy arms of the trees&mdash;the gray, swaying twigs&mdash;a lone,
rustling leaf somewhere. And snow. And wretched outbuildings in
need of repair. And Clyde becoming indifferent to her. And the
thought now came to her swiftly and urgently that she must not stay
here any longer than she could help&mdash;not even this day, if
possible. She must return to Lycurgus and be near Clyde, if no more
than to persuade him to his old affection for her, or if not that,
then by her presence to prevent him from devoting himself too
wholly to these others. Decidedly, to go away like this, even for
the holidays, was not good. In her absence he might desert her
completely for another girl, and if so, then would it not be her
fault? At once she pondered as to what excuse she could make in
order to return this day. But realizing that in view of all these
preliminary preparations this would seem inexplicably unreasonable,
to her mother most of all, she decided to endure it as she had
planned until Christmas afternoon, then to return, never to leave
for so long a period again.</p>

<p>But ad interim, all her thoughts were on how and in what way she
could make more sure, if at all, of Clyde's continued interest and
social and emotional support, as well as marriage in the future.
Supposing he had lied to her, how could she influence him, if at
all, not to do so again? How to make him feel that lying between
them was not right? How to make herself securely first in his heart
against the dreams engendered by the possible charms of
another?</p>

<p>How?</p>

<h3>Chapter 30</h3>

<p>But Roberta's return to Lycurgus and her room at the Gilpins'
Christmas night brought no sign of Clyde nor any word of
explanation. For in connection with the Griffiths in the meantime
there had been a development relating to all this which, could she
or Clyde have known, would have interested both not a little. For
subsequent to the Steele dance that same item read by Roberta fell
under the eyes of Gilbert. He was seated at the breakfast table the
Sunday morning after the party and was about to sip from a cup of
coffee when he encountered it. On the instant his teeth snapped
about as a man might snap his watch lid, and instead of drinking he
put his cup down and examined the item with more care. Other than
his mother there was no one at the table or in the room with him,
but knowing that she, more than any of the others, shared his views
in regard to Clyde, he now passed the paper over to her.</p>

<p>"Look at who's breaking into society now, will you?" he
admonished sharply and sarcastically, his eyes radiating the hard
and contemptuous opposition he felt. "We'll be having him up here
next!"</p>

<p>"Who?" inquired Mrs. Griffiths, as she took the paper and
examined the item calmly and judicially, yet not without a little
of outwardly suppressed surprise when she saw the name. For
although the fact of Clyde's having been picked up by Sondra in her
car sometime before and later been invited to dinner at the
Trumbulls', had been conveyed to the family sometime before, still
a society notice in The Star was different. "Now I wonder how it
was that he came to be invited to that?" meditated Mrs. Griffiths
who was always conscious of her son's mood in regard to all
this.</p>

<p>"Now, who would do it but that little Finchley snip, the little
smart aleck?" snapped Gilbert. "She's got the idea from
somewhere&mdash; from Bella for all I know&mdash;that we don't care
to have anything to do with him, and she thinks this is a clever
way to hit back at me for some of the things I've done to her, or
that she thinks I've done. At any rate, she thinks I don't like
her, and that's right, I don't. And Bella knows it, too. And that
goes for that little Cranston show-off, too. They're both always
running around with her. They're a set of show-offs and wasters,
the whole bunch, and that goes for their brothers, too&mdash;Grant
Cranston and Stew Finchley&mdash;and if something don't go wrong
with one or another of that bunch one of these days, I miss my
guess. You mark my word! They don't do a thing, the whole lot of
them, from one year's end to the other but play around and dance
and run here and there, as though there wasn't anything else in the
world for them to do. And why you and Dad let Bella run with 'em as
much as she does is more than I can see."</p>

<p>To this his mother protested. It was not possible for her to
entirely estrange Bella from one portion of this local social group
and direct her definitely toward the homes of certain others. They
all mingled too freely. And she was getting along in years and had
a mind of her own.</p>

<p>Just the same his mother's apology and especially in the face of
the publication of this item by no means lessened Gilbert's
opposition to Clyde's social ambitions and opportunities. What!
That poor little moneyless cousin of his who had committed first
the unpardonable offense of looking like him and, second, of coming
here to Lycurgus and fixing himself on this very superior family.
And after he had shown him all too plainly, and from the first,
that he personally did not like him, did not want him, and if left
to himself would never for so much as a moment endure him.</p>

<p>"He hasn't any money," he declared finally and very bitterly to
his mother, "and he's hanging on here by the skin of his teeth as
it is. And what for? If he is taken up by these people, what can he
do? He certainly hasn't the money to do as they do, and he can't
get it. And if he could, his job here wouldn't let him go anywhere
much, unless some one troubled to pay his way. And how he is going
to do his work and run with that crowd is more than I know. That
bunch is on the go all the time."</p>

<p>Actually he was wondering whether Clyde would be included from
now on, and if so, what was to be done about it. If he were to be
taken up in this way, how was he, or the family, either, to escape
from being civil to him? For obviously, as earlier and subsequent
developments proved, his father did not choose to send him
away.</p>

<p>Indeed, subsequent to this conversation, Mrs. Griffiths had laid
the paper, together with a version of Gilbert's views before her
husband at this same breakfast table. But he, true to his previous
mood in regard to Clyde, was not inclined to share his son's
opinion. On the contrary, he seemed, as Mrs. Griffiths saw it, to
look upon the development recorded by the item as a justification
in part of his own original estimate of Clyde.</p>

<p>"I must say," he began, after listening to his wife to the end,
"I can't see what's wrong with his going to a party now and then,
or being invited here and there even if he hasn't any money. It
looks more like a compliment to him and to us than anything else. I
know how Gil feels about him. But it rather looks to me as though
Clyde's just a little better than Gil thinks he is. At any rate, I
can't and I wouldn't want to do anything about it. I've asked him
to come down here, and the least I can do is to give him an
opportunity to better himself. He seems to be doing his work all
right. Besides, how would it look if I didn't?"</p>

<p>And later, because of some additional remarks on the part of
Gilbert to his mother, he added: "I'd certainly rather have him
going with some of the better people than some of the worse
ones&mdash; that's one thing sure. He's neat and polite and from
all I hear at the factory does his work well enough. As a matter of
fact, I think it would have been better if we had invited him up to
the lake last summer for a few days anyhow, as I suggested. As it
is now, if we don't do something pretty soon, it will look as
though we think he isn't good enough for us when the other people
here seem to think he is. If you'll take my advice, you'll have him
up here for Christmas or New Year's, anyhow, just to show that we
don't think any less of him than our friends do."</p>

<p>This suggestion, once transferred to Gilbert by his mother,
caused him to exclaim: "Well, I'll be hanged! All right, only don't
think I'm going to lay myself out to be civil to him. It's a
wonder, if Father thinks he's so able, that he don't make a real
position for him somewhere."</p>

<p>Just the same, nothing might have come of this had it not been
that Bella, returning from Albany this same day, learned via
contacts and telephone talks with Sondra and Bertine of the
developments in connection with Clyde. Also that he had been
invited to accompany them to the New Year's Eve dance at the
Ellerslies' in Schenectady, Bella having been previously scheduled
to make a part of this group before Clyde was thought of.</p>

<p>This sudden development, reported by Bella to her mother, was of
sufficient import to cause Mrs. Griffiths as well as Samuel, if not
Gilbert, later to decide to make the best of a situation which
obviously was being forced upon them and themselves invite Clyde
for dinner&mdash;Christmas Day&mdash;a sedate affair to which many
others were bid. For this as they now decided would serve to make
plain to all and at once that Clyde was not being as wholly ignored
as some might imagine. It was the only reasonable thing to do at
this late date. And Gilbert, on hearing this, and realizing that in
this instance he was checkmated, exclaimed sourly: "Oh, all right.
Invite him if you want to&mdash;if that's the way you and Dad feel
about it. I don't see any real necessity for it even now. But you
fix it to suit yourself. Constance and I are going over to Utica
for the afternoon, anyhow, so I couldn't be there even if I wanted
to."</p>

<p>He was thinking of what an outrageous thing it was that a girl
whom he disliked as much as he did Sondra could thus via her
determination and plottings thrust his own cousin on him and he be
unable to prevent it. And what a beggar Clyde must be to attempt to
attach himself in this way when he knew that he was not wanted!
What sort of a youth was he, anyhow?</p>

<p>And so it was that on Monday morning Clyde had received another
letter from the Griffiths, this time signed by Myra, asking him to
have dinner with them at two o'clock Christmas Day. But, since this
at that time did not seem to interfere with his meeting Roberta
Christmas night at eight, he merely gave himself over to extreme
rejoicing in regard to it all now, and at last he was nearly as
well placed here, socially, as any one. For although he had no
money, see how he was being received&mdash;and by the Griffiths,
too&mdash;among all the others. And Sondra taking so great an
interest in him, actually talking and acting as though she might be
ready to fall in love. And Gilbert checkmated by his social
popularity. What would you say to that? It testified, as he saw it
now, that at least his relatives had not forgotten him or that,
because of his recent success in other directions, they were
finding it necessary to be civil to him&mdash;a thought that was
the same as the bays of victory to a contestant. He viewed it with
as much pleasure almost as though there had never been any hiatus
at all.</p>

<h3>Chapter 31</h3>

<p>Unfortunately, however, the Christmas dinner at the Griffiths',
which included the Starks and their daughter Arabella, Mr. and Mrs.
Wynant, who in the absence of their daughter Constance with Gilbert
were dining with the Griffiths, the Arnolds, Anthonys, Harriets,
Taylors and others of note in Lycurgus, so impressed and even
overawed Clyde that although five o'clock came and then six, he was
incapable of breaking away or thinking clearly and compellingly of
his obligation to Roberta. Even when, slightly before six, the
greater portion of those who had been thus cheerfully entertained
began rising and making their bows and departing (and when he, too,
should have been doing the same and thinking of his appointment
with Roberta), being accosted by Violet Taylor, who was part of the
younger group, and who now began talking of some additional
festivities to be held that same evening at the Anthonys', and who
added most urgently, "You're coming with us, aren't you? Sure you
are," he at once acquiesced, although his earlier promise to
Roberta forced the remembrance that she was probably already back
and expecting him. But still he had time even now, didn't he?</p>

<p>Yet, once at the Anthonys', and talking and dancing with various
girls, the obligation faded. But at nine he began worrying a
little. For by this time she must be in her room and wondering what
had become of him and his promise. And on Christmas night, too. And
after she had been away three days.</p>

<p>Inwardly he grew more and more restless and troubled, the while
outwardly he maintained that same high spirit that characterized
him throughout the afternoon. Fortunately for his own mood, this
same group, having danced and frolicked every night for the past
week until almost nervously exhausted, it now unanimously and
unconsciously yielded to weariness and at eleven thirty, broke up.
And after having escorted Bella Griffiths to her door, Clyde
hurried around to Elm Street to see if by any chance Roberta was
still awake.</p>

<p>As he neared the Gilpins' he perceived through the snow-covered
bushes and trees the glow of her single lamp. And for the time
being, troubled as to what he should say&mdash;how excuse himself
for this inexplicable lapse&mdash;he paused near one of the large
trees that bordered the street, debating with himself as to just
what he would say. Would he insist that he had again been to the
Griffiths', or where? For according to his previous story he had
only been there the Friday before. In the months before when he had
no social contacts, but was merely romanticizing in regard to them,
the untruths he found himself telling her caused him no twinges of
any kind. They were not real and took up no actual portion of his
time, nor did they interfere with any of his desired contacts with
her. But now in the face of the actuality and the fact that these
new contacts meant everything to his future, as he saw it, he
hesitated. His quick conclusion was to explain his absence this
evening by a second invitation which had come later, also by
asseverating that the Griffiths being potentially in charge of his
material welfare, it was becoming more and more of a duty rather
than an idle, evasive pleasure to desert her in this way at their
command. Could he help it? And with this half-truth permanently
fixed in his mind, he crossed the snow and gently tapped at her
window.</p>

<p>At once the light was extinguished and a moment later the
curtain lifted. Then Roberta, who had been mournfully brooding,
opened the door and admitted him, having previously lit a candle as
was her custom in order to avoid detection as much as possible, and
at once he began in a whisper:</p>

<p>"Gee, but this society business here is getting to be the dizzy
thing, honey. I never saw such a town as this. Once you go with
these people one place to do one thing, they always have something
else they want you to do. They're on the go all the time. When I
went there Friday (he was referring to his lie about having gone to
the Griffiths'), I thought that would be the last until after the
holidays, but yesterday, and just when I was planning to go
somewhere else, I got a note saying they expected me to come there
again to-day for dinner sure."</p>

<p>"And to-day when I thought the dinner would begin at two," he
continued to explain, "and end in time for me to be around here by
eight like I said, it didn't start until three and only broke up a
few minutes ago. Isn't that the limit? And I just couldn't get away
for the last four hours. How've you been, honey? Did you have a
good time? I hope so. Did they like the present I gave you?"</p>

<p>He rattled off these questions, to which she made brief and
decidedly terse replies, all the time looking at him as much as to
say, "Oh, Clyde, how can you treat me like this?"</p>

<p>But Clyde was so much interested in his own alibi, and how to
convince Roberta of the truth of it, that neither before nor after
slipping off his coat, muffler and gloves and smoothing back his
hair, did he look at her directly, or even tenderly, or indeed do
anything to demonstrate to her that he was truly delighted to see
her again. On the contrary, he was so fidgety and in part flustered
that despite his past professions and actions she could feel that
apart from being moderately glad to see her again he was more
concerned about himself and his own partially explained defection
than he was about her. And although after a few moments he took her
in his arms and pressed his lips to hers, still, as on Saturday,
she could feel that he was only partially united to her in spirit.
Other things&mdash;the affairs that had kept him from her on Friday
and to-night&mdash;were disturbing his thoughts and hers.</p>

<p>She looked at him, not exactly believing and yet not entirely
wishing to disbelieve him. He might have been at the Griffiths', as
he said, and they might have detained him. And yet he might not
have, either. For she could not help recalling that on the previous
Saturday he had said he had been there Friday and the paper on the
other hand had stated that he was in Gloversville. But if she
questioned him in regard to these things now, would he not get
angry and lie to her still more? For after all she could not help
thinking that apart from his love for her she had no real claim on
him. But she could not possibly imagine that he could change so
quickly.</p>

<p>"So that was why you didn't come to-night, was it?" she asked,
with more spirit and irritation than she had ever used with him
before. "I thought you told me sure you wouldn't let anything
interfere," she went on, a little heavily.</p>

<p>"Well, so I did," he admitted. "And I wouldn't have either,
except for the letter I got. You know I wouldn't let any one but my
uncle interfere, but I couldn't turn them down when they asked me
to come there on Christmas Day. It's too important. It wouldn't
look right, would it, especially when you weren't going to be here
in the afternoon?"</p>

<p>The manner and tone in which he said this conveyed to Roberta
more clearly than anything that he had ever said before how
significant he considered this connection with his relatives to be
and how unimportant anything she might value in regard to this
relationship was to him. It came to her now that in spite of all
his enthusiasm and demonstrativeness in the first stages of this
affair, possibly she was much more trivial in his estimation than
she had seemed to herself. And that meant that her dreams and
sacrifices thus far had been in vain. She became frightened.</p>

<p>"Well, anyhow," she went on dubiously in the face of this,
"don't you think you might have left a note here, Clyde, so I would
have got it when I got in?" She asked this mildly, not wishing to
irritate him too much.</p>

<p>"But didn't I just tell you, honey, I didn't expect to be so
late. I thought the thing would all be over by six, anyhow."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;well&mdash;anyhow&mdash;I know&mdash;but
still&mdash;"</p>

<p>Her face wore a puzzled, troubled, nervous look, in which was
mingled fear, sorrow, depression, distrust, a trace of resentment
and a trace of despair, all of which, coloring and animating her
eyes, which were now fixed on him in round orblike solemnity,
caused him to suffer from a sense of having misused and demeaned
her not a little. And because her eyes seemed to advertise this, he
flushed a dark red flush that colored deeply his naturally very
pale cheeks. But without appearing to notice this or lay any stress
on it in any way at the time, Roberta added after a moment: "I
notice that The Star mentioned that Gloversville party Sunday, but
it didn't say anything about your cousins being over there. Were
they?"</p>

<p>For the first time in all her questioning of him, she asked this
as though she might possibly doubt him&mdash;a development which
Clyde had scarcely anticipated in connection with her up to this
time, and more than anything else, it troubled and irritated
him.</p>

<p>"Of course they were," he replied falsely. "Why do you want to
ask a thing like that when I told you they were?"</p>

<p>"Well, dear, I don't mean anything by it. I only wanted to know.
But I did notice that it mentioned all those other people from
Lycurgus that you are always talking about, Sondra Finchley,
Bertine Cranston. You know you never mentioned anybody but the
Trumbulls."</p>

<p>Her tone tended to make him bristle and grow cross, as she
saw.</p>

<p>"Yes, I saw that, too, but it ain't so. If they were there, I
didn't see them. The papers don't always get everything right." In
spite of a certain crossness and irritation at being trapped in
this fashion, his manner did not carry conviction, and he knew it.
And he began to resent the fact that she should question him so.
Why should she? Wasn't he of sufficient importance to move in this
new world without her holding him back in this way?</p>

<p>Instead of denying or reproaching him further, she merely looked
at him, her expression one of injured wistfulness. She did not
believe him now entirely and she did not utterly disbelieve him. A
part of what he said was probably true. More important was it that
he should care for her enough not to want to lie to her or to treat
her badly. But how was that to be effected if he did not want to be
kind or truthful? She moved back from him a few steps and with a
gesture of helplessness said: "Oh, Clyde, you don't have to story
to me. Don't you know that? I wouldn't care where you went if you
would just tell me beforehand and not leave me like this all alone
on Christmas night. It's just that that hurts so."</p>

<p>"But I'm not storying to you, Bert," he reiterated crossly. "I
can't help how things look even if the paper did say so. The
Griffiths were over there, and I can prove it. I got around here as
soon as I could to-day. What do you want to get so mad about all at
once? I've told you how things are. I can't do just as I want to
here. They call me up at the last minute and want me to go. And I
just can't get out of it. What's the use of being so mad about
it?"</p>

<p>He stared defiantly while Roberta, checkmated in this general
way, was at a loss as to how to proceed. The item about New Year's
Eve was in her mind, but she felt that it might not be wise to say
anything more now. More poignantly than ever now she was
identifying him with that gay life of which he, but not she, was a
part. And yet she hesitated even now to let him know how sharp were
the twinges of jealousy that were beginning to assail her. They had
such a good time in that fine world&mdash;he and those he
knew&mdash; and she had so little. And besides, now he was always
talking about that Sondra Finchley and that Bertine Cranston, or
the papers were. Was it in either of those that he was most
interested?</p>

<p>"Do you like that Miss Finchley very much?" she suddenly asked,
looking up at him in the shadow, her desire to obtain some slight
satisfaction&mdash;some little light on all this
trouble&mdash;still torturing her.</p>

<p>At once Clyde sensed the importance of the question&mdash;a
suggestion of partially suppressed interest and jealousy and
helplessness, more in her voice even than in the way she looked.
There was something so soft, coaxing and sad about her voice at
times, especially when she was most depressed. At the same time he
was slightly taken back by the shrewd or telepathic way in which
she appeared to fix on Sondra. Immediately he felt that she should
not know&mdash;that it would irritate her. At the same time, vanity
in regard to his general position here, which hourly was becoming
more secure apparently, caused him to say:</p>

<p>"Oh, I like her some, sure. She's very pretty, and a dandy
dancer. And she has lots of money and dresses well." He was about
to add that outside of that Sondra appealed to him in no other way,
when Roberta, sensing something of the true interest he felt in
this girl perhaps and the wide gulf that lay between herself and
all his world, suddenly exclaimed: "Yes, and who wouldn't, with all
the money she has? If I had as much money as that, I could
too."</p>

<p>And to his astonishment and dismay even, at this point her voice
grew suddenly vibrant and then broke, as on a sob. And as he could
both see and feel, she was deeply hurt&mdash;terribly and painfully
hurt&mdash;heartsore and jealous; and at once, although his first
impulse was to grow angry and defiant again, his mood as suddenly
softened. For it now pained him not a little to think that some one
of whom he had once been so continuously fond up to this time
should be made to suffer through jealousy of him, for he himself
well knew the pangs of jealousy in connection with Hortense. He
could for some reason almost see himself in Roberta's place. And
for this reason, if no other, he now said, and quite softly: "Oh,
now, Bert, as though I couldn't tell you about her or any one else
without your getting mad about it! I didn't mean that I was
especially interested in her. I was just telling you what I thought
you wanted to know because you asked me if I liked her, that's
all."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I know," replied Roberta, standing tensely and
nervously before him, her face white, her hands suddenly clenched,
and looking up at him dubiously and yet pleadingly. "But they've
got everything. You know they have. And I haven't got anything,
really. And it's so hard for me to keep up my end and against all
of them, too, and with all they have." Her voice shook, and she
ceased talking, her eyes filling and her lips beginning to quiver.
And as swiftly she concealed her face with her hands and turned
away, her shoulders shaking as she did so. Indeed her body was now
torn for the moment by the most desperate and convulsive sobs, so
much so that Clyde, perplexed and astonished and deeply moved by
this sudden display of a pent-up and powerful emotion, as suddenly
was himself moved deeply. For obviously this was no trick or
histrionic bit intended to influence him, but rather a sudden and
overwhelming vision of herself, as he himself could sense, as a
rather lorn and isolated girl without friends or prospects as
opposed to those others in whom he was now so interested and who
had so much more&mdash;everything in fact. For behind her in her
vision lay all the lorn and detached years that had marred her
youth, now so vivid because of her recent visit. She was really
intensely moved&mdash;overwhelmingly and helplessly.</p>

<p>And now from the very bottom of her heart she exclaimed: "If I'd
ever had a chance like some girls&mdash;if I'd ever been anywhere
or seen anything! But just to be brought up in the country and
without any money or clothes or anything&mdash;and nobody to show
you. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!"</p>

<p>The moment she said these things she was actually ashamed of
having made so weak and self-condemnatory a confession, since that
was what really was troubling him in connection with her, no
doubt.</p>

<p>"Oh, Roberta, darling," he said instantly and tenderly, putting
his arms around her, genuinely moved by his own dereliction. "You
mustn't cry like that, dearest. You mustn't. I didn't mean to hurt
you, honest I didn't. Truly, I didn't, dear. I know you've had a
hard time, honey. I know how you feel, and how you've been up
against things in one way and another. Sure I do, Bert, and you
mustn't cry, dearest. I love you just the same. Truly I do, and I
always will. I'm sorry if I've hurt you, honest I am. I couldn't
help it to-night if I didn't come, honest, or last Friday either.
Why, it just wasn't possible. But I won't be so mean like that any
more, if I can help it. Honest I won't. You're the sweetest,
dearest girl. And you've got such lovely hair and eyes, and such a
pretty little figure. Honest you have, Bert. And you can dance too,
as pretty as anybody. And you look just as nice, honest you do,
dear. Won't you stop now, honey? Please do. I'm so sorry, honey, if
I've hurt you in any way."</p>

<p>There was about Clyde at times a certain strain of tenderness,
evoked by experiences, disappointments, and hardships in his own
life, which came out to one and another, almost any other, under
such circumstances as these. At such times he had a soft and
melting voice. His manner was as tender and gentle almost as that
of a mother with a baby. It drew a girl like Roberta intensely to
him. At the same time, such emotion in him, though vivid, was of
brief duration. It was like the rush and flutter of a summer
storm&mdash;soon come and soon gone. Yet in this instance it was
sufficient to cause Roberta to feel that he fully understood and
sympathized with her and perhaps liked her all the better for it.
Things were not so had for the moment, anyhow. She had him and his
love and sympathy to a very marked degree at any rate, and because
of this and her very great comfort in it, and his soothing words,
she began to dry her eyes, to say that she was sorry to think that
she was such a cry-baby and that she hoped he would forgive her,
because in crying she had wet the bosom of his spotless white shirt
with her tears. And she would not do it any more if Clyde would
just forgive her this once&mdash;the while, touched by a passion he
scarcely believed was buried in her in any such volume, he now
continued to kiss her hands, cheeks, and finally her lips.</p>

<p>And between these pettings and coaxings and kissings it was that
he reaffirmed to her, most foolishly and falsely in this instance
(since he was really caring for Sondra in a way which, while
different, was just as vital&mdash;perhaps even more so), that he
regarded her as first, last and most in his heart, always&mdash;a
statement which caused her to feel that perhaps after all she might
have misjudged him. Also that her position, if anything, was more
secure, if not more wonderful than ever it had been
before&mdash;far superior to that of these other girls who might
see him socially perhaps, but who did not have him to love them in
this wonderful way.</p>

<h3>Chapter 32</h3>

<p>Clyde now was actually part and parcel of this local winter
social scene. The Griffiths having introduced him to their friends
and connections, it followed as a matter of course that he would be
received in most homes here. But in this very limited world, where
quite every one who was anything at all knew every one else, the
state of one's purse was as much, and in some instances even more,
considered than one's social connections. For these local families
of distinction were convinced that not only one's family but one's
wealth was the be-all and end-all of every happy union meant to
include social security. And in consequence, while considering
Clyde as one who was unquestionably eligible socially, still,
because it had been whispered about that his means were very
slender, they were not inclined to look upon him as one who might
aspire to marriage with any of their daughters. Hence, while they
were to the fore with invitations, still in so far as their own
children and connections were concerned they were also to the fore
with precautionary hints as to the inadvisability of too numerous
contacts with him.</p>

<p>However, the mood of Sondra and her group being friendly toward
him, and the observations and comments of their friends and parents
not as yet too definite, Clyde continued to receive invitations to
the one type of gathering that most interested him&mdash;that which
began and ended with dancing. And although his purse was short, he
got on well enough. For once Sondra had interested herself in him,
it was not long before she began to realize what his financial
state was and was concerned to make his friendship for her at least
as inexpensive as possible. And because of this attitude on her
part, which in turn was conveyed to Bertine, Grant Cranston and
others, it became possible on most occasions for Clyde, especially
when the affair was local, to go here and there without the
expenditure of any money. Even when the affair was at any point
beyond Lycurgus and he consented to go, the car of another was
delegated to pick him up.</p>

<p>Frequently after the New Year's Eve trip to Schenectady, which
proved to be an outing of real import to both Clyde and
Sondra&mdash; seeing that on that occasion she drew nearer to him
affectionately than ever before&mdash;it was Sondra herself who
chose to pick him up in her car. He had actually succeeded in
impressing her, and in a way that most flattered her vanity at the
same time that it appealed to the finest trait in her&mdash;a warm
desire to have some one, some youth like Clyde, who was at once
attractive and of good social station, dependent upon her. She knew
that her parents would not countenance an affair between her and
Clyde because of his poverty. She had originally not contemplated
any, though now she found herself wishing that something of the
kind might be.</p>

<p>However, no opportunity for further intimacies occurred until
one night about two weeks after the New Year's party. They were
returning from a similar affair at Amsterdam, and after Bella
Griffiths and Grant and Bertine Cranston had been driven to their
respective homes, Stuart Finchley had called back: "Now we'll take
you home, Griffiths." At once Sondra, swayed by the delight of
contact with Clyde and not willing to end it so soon, said: "If you
want to come over to our place, I'll make some hot chocolate before
you go home. Would you like that?"</p>

<p>"Oh, sure I would," Clyde had answered gayly.</p>

<p>"Here goes then," called Stuart, turning the car toward the
Finchley home. "But as for me, I'm going to turn in. It's way after
three now."</p>

<p>"That's a good brother. Your beauty sleep, you know," replied
Sondra.</p>

<p>And having turned the car into the garage, the three made their
way through the rear entrance into the kitchen. Her brother having
left them, Sondra asked Clyde to be seated at a servants' table
while she brought the ingredients. But he, impressed by this
culinary equipment, the like of which he had never seen before,
gazed about wondering at the wealth and security which could
sustain it.</p>

<p>"My, this is a big kitchen, isn't it?" he remarked. "What a lot
of things you have here to cook with, haven't you?"</p>

<p>And she, realizing from this that he had not been accustomed to
equipment of this order before coming to Lycurgus and hence was all
the more easily to be impressed, replied: "Oh, I don't know. Aren't
all kitchens as big as this?"</p>

<p>Clyde, thinking of the poverty he knew, and assuming from this
that she was scarcely aware of anything less than this, was all the
more overawed by the plethora of the world to which she belonged.
What means! Only to think of being married to such a girl, when all
such as this would become an everyday state. One would have a cook
and servants, a great house and car, no one to work for, and only
orders to give, a thought which impressed him greatly. It made her
various self-conscious gestures and posings all the more
entrancing. And she, sensing the import of all this to Clyde, was
inclined to exaggerate her own inseparable connection with it. To
him, more than any one else, as she now saw, she shone as a star, a
paragon of luxury and social supremacy.</p>

<p>Having prepared the chocolate in a commonplace aluminum pan, to
further impress him she sought out a heavily chased silver service
which was in another room. She poured the chocolate into a highly
ornamented urn and then carried it to the table and put it down
before him. Then swinging herself up beside him, she said: "Now,
isn't this chummy? I just love to get out in the kitchen like this,
but I can only do it when the cook's out. He won't let any one near
the place when he's here."</p>

<p>"Oh, is that so?" asked Clyde, who was quite unaware of the ways
of cooks in connection with private homes&mdash;an inquiry which
quite convinced Sondra that there must have been little if any real
means in the world from which he sprang. Nevertheless, because he
had come to mean so much to her, she was by no means inclined to
turn back. And so when he finally exclaimed: "Isn't it wonderful to
be together like this, Sondra? Just think, I hardly got a chance to
say a word to you all evening, alone," she replied, without in any
way being irritated by the familiarity, "You think so? I'm glad you
do," and smiled in a slightly supercilious though affectionate
way.</p>

<p>And at the sight of her now in her white satin and crystal
evening gown, her slippered feet swinging so intimately near, a
faint perfume radiating to his nostrils, he was stirred. In fact,
his imagination in regard to her was really inflamed. Youth,
beauty, wealth such as this&mdash;what would it not mean? And she,
feeling the intensity of his admiration and infected in part at
least by the enchantment and fervor that was so definitely
dominating him, was swayed to the point where she was seeing him as
one for whom she could care&mdash;very much. Weren't his eyes
bright and dark&mdash;very liquid and eager? And his hair! It
looked so enticing, lying low upon his white forehead. She wished
that she could touch it now&mdash; smooth it with her hands and
touch his cheeks. And his hands&mdash;they were thin and sensitive
and graceful. Like Roberta, and Hortense and Rita before her, she
noticed them.</p>

<p>But he was silent now with a tightly restrained silence which he
was afraid to liberate in words. For he was thinking: "Oh, if only
I could say to her how beautiful I really think she is. If I could
just put my arms around her and kiss her, and kiss her, and kiss
her, and have her kiss me in the same way." And strangely,
considering his first approaches toward Roberta, the thought was
without lust, just the desire to constrain and fondle a perfect
object. Indeed, his eyes fairly radiated this desire and intensity.
And while she noted this and was in part made dubious by it, since
it was the thing in Clyde she most feared&mdash;still she was
intrigued by it to the extent of wishing to know its further
meaning.</p>

<p>And so she now said, teasingly: "Was there anything very
important you wanted to say?"</p>

<p>"I'd like to say a lot of things to you, Sondra, if you would
only let me," he returned eagerly. "But you told me not to."</p>

<p>"Oh, so I did. Well, I meant that, too. I'm glad you mind so
well." There was a provoking smile upon her lips and she looked at
him as much as to say: "But you don't really believe I meant all of
that, do you?"</p>

<p>Overcome by the suggestion of her eyes, Clyde got up and, taking
both her hands in his and looking directly into her eyes, said:
"You didn't mean all of it, then, did you, Sondra? Not all of it,
anyhow. Oh, I wish I could tell you all that I am thinking." His
eyes spoke, and now sharply conscious again of how easy it was to
inflame him, and yet anxious to permit him to proceed as he wished,
she leaned back from him and said, "Oh, yes, I'm sure I did. You
take almost everything too seriously, don't you?" But at the same
time, and in spite of herself, her expression relaxed and she once
more smiled.</p>

<p>"I can't help it, Sondra. I can't! I can't!" he began, eagerly
and almost vehemently. "You don't know what effect you have on me.
You're so beautiful. Oh, you are. You know you are. I think about
you all the time. Really I do, Sondra. You've made me just crazy
about you, so much so that I can hardly sleep for thinking about
you. Gee, I'm wild! I never go anywhere or see you any place but
what I think of you all the time afterward. Even to-night when I
saw you dancing with all those fellows I could hardly stand it. I
just wanted you to be dancing with me&mdash;no one else. You've got
such beautiful eyes, Sondra, and such a lovely mouth and chin, and
such a wonderful smile."</p>

<p>He lifted his hands as though to caress her gently, yet holding
them back, and at the same time dreamed into her eyes as might a
devotee into those of a saint, then suddenly put his arms about her
and drew her close to him. She, thrilled and in part seduced by his
words, instead of resisting as definitely as she would have in any
other case, now gazed at him, fascinated by his enthusiasms. She
was so trapped and entranced by his passion for her that it seemed
to her now as though she might care for him as much as he wished.
Very, very much, if she only dared. He, too, was beautiful and
alluring to her. He, too, was really wonderful, even if he were
poor&mdash;so much more intense and dynamic than any of these other
youths that she knew here. Would it not be wonderful if, her
parents and her state permitting, she could share with him
completely such a mood as this? Simultaneously the thought came to
her that should her parents know of this it might not be possible
for her to continue this relationship in any form, let alone to
develop it or enjoy it in the future. Yet regardless of this
thought now, which arrested and stilled her for a moment, she
continued to yearn toward him. Her eyes were warm and tender&mdash;
her lips wreathed with a gracious smile.</p>

<p>"I'm sure I oughtn't to let you say all these things to me. I
know I shouldn't," she protested weakly, yet looking at him
affectionately. "It isn't the right thing to do, I know, but
still&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why not? Why isn't it right, Sondra? Why mayn't I when I care
for you so much?" His eyes became clouded with sadness, and she,
noting it, exclaimed: "Oh, well," then paused, "I&mdash;I&mdash;"
She was about to add, "Don't think they would ever let us go on
with it," but instead she only replied, "I guess I don't know you
well enough."</p>

<p>"Oh, Sondra, when I love you so much and I'm so crazy about you!
Don't you care at all like I care for you?"</p>

<p>Because of the uncertainty expressed by her, his eyes were now
seeking, frightened, sad. The combination had an intense appeal for
her. She merely looked at him dubiously, wondering what could be
the result of such an infatuation as this. And he, noting the
wavering something in her own eyes, pulled her closer and kissed
her. Instead of resenting it she lay for a moment willingly,
joyously, in his arms, then suddenly sat up, the thought of what
she was permitting him to do&mdash;kiss her in this way&mdash;and
what it must mean to him, causing her on the instant to recover all
her poise. "I think you'd better go now," she said definitely, yet
not unkindly. "Don't you?"</p>

<p>And Clyde, who himself had been surprised and afterwards a
little startled, and hence reduced by his own boldness, now pleaded
rather weakly, and yet submissively. "Angry?"</p>

<p>And she, in turn sensing his submissiveness, that of the slave
for the master, and in part liking and in part resenting it, since
like Roberta and Hortense, even she preferred to be mastered rather
than to master, shook her head negatively and a little sadly.</p>

<p>"It's very late," was all she said, and smiled tenderly.</p>

<p>And Clyde, realizing that for some reason he must not say more,
had not the courage or persistence or the background to go further
with her now, went for his coat and, looking sadly but obediently
back at her, departed.</p>

<h3>Chapter 33</h3>

<p>One of the things that Roberta soon found was that her intuitive
notions in regard to all this were not without speedy
substantiation. For exactly as before, though with the usual
insistence afterward that there was no real help for it, there
continued to be these same last moment changes of plan and
unannounced absences. And although she complained at times, or
pleaded, or merely contented herself with quite silent and not
always obvious "blues," still these same effected no real
modification or improvement. For Clyde was now hopelessly enamored
of Sandra and by no means to be changed, or moved even, by anything
in connection with Roberta. Sondra was too wonderful!</p>

<p>At the same time because she was there all of the working hours
of each day in the same room with him, he could not fail
instinctively to feel some of the thoughts that employed her
mind&mdash;such dark, sad, despairing thoughts. And these seized
upon him at times as definitely and poignantly as though they were
voices of accusation or complaint&mdash;so much so that he could
not help but suggest by way of amelioration that he would like to
see her and that he was coming around that night if she were going
to be home. And so distrait was she, and still so infatuated with
him, that she could not resist admitting that she wanted him to
come. And once there, the psychic personality of the past as well
as of the room itself was not without its persuasion and hence
emotional compulsion.</p>

<p>But most foolishly anticipating, as he now did, a future more
substantial than the general local circumstances warranted, he was
more concerned than ever lest his present relationship to Roberta
should in any way prove inimical to all this. Supposing that Sondra
at some time, in some way, should find out concerning Roberta? How
fatal that would be! Or that Roberta should become aware of his
devotion to Sondra and so develop an active resentment which should
carry her to the length of denouncing or exposing him. For
subsequent to the New Year's Eve engagement, he was all too
frequently appearing at the factory of a morning with explanatory
statements that because of some invitation from the Griffiths,
Harriets, or others, he would not be able to keep an engagement
with her that night, for instance, that he had made a day or two
before. And later, on three different occasions, because Sondra had
called for him in her car, he had departed without a word, trusting
to what might come to him the next day in the way of an excuse to
smooth the matter over.</p>

<p>Yet anomalous, if not exactly unprecedented as it may seem, this
condition of mingled sympathy and opposition gave rise at last to
the feeling in him that come what might he must find some method of
severing this tie, even though it lacerated Roberta to the point of
death (Why should he care? He had never told her that he would
marry her.) or endangered his own position here in case she were
not satisfied to release him as voicelessly as he wished. At other
times it caused him to feel that indeed he was a sly and shameless
and cruel person who had taken undue advantage of a girl who, left
to herself, would never have troubled with him. And this latter
mood, in spite of slights and lies and thinly excused neglects and
absences at times in the face of the most definite
agreements&mdash;so strange is the libido of the race&mdash;brought
about the reenactment of the infernal or celestial command laid
upon Adam and his breed: "Thy desire shall be to thy mate."</p>

<p>But there was this to be said in connection with the
relationship between these two, that no time, owing to the
inexperience of Clyde, as well as Roberta, had there been any
adequate understanding or use of more than the simplest, and for
the most part unsatisfactory, contraceptive devices. About the
middle of February, and, interestingly enough, at about the time
when Clyde, because of the continuing favor of Sondra, had about
reached the point where he was determined once and for all to end,
not only this physical, but all other connection with Roberta, she
on her part was beginning to see clearly that, in spite of his
temporizing and her own incurable infatuation for him, pursuit of
him by her was futile and that it would be more to the satisfaction
of her pride, if not to the ease of her heart, if she were to leave
here and in some other place seek some financial help that would
permit her to live and still help her parents and forget him if she
could. Unfortunately for this, she was compelled, to her dismay and
terror, to enter the factory one morning, just about this time, her
face a symbol of even graver and more terrifying doubts and fears
than any that had hitherto assailed her. For now, in addition to
her own troubled conclusions in regard to Clyde, there had sprung
up over night the dark and constraining fear that even this might
not now be possible, for the present at least. For because of her
own and Clyde's temporizing over his and her sentimentality and her
unconquerable affection for him, she now, at a time when it was
most inimical for both, found herself pregnant.</p>

<p>Ever since she had yielded to his blandishments, she had counted
the days and always had been able to congratulate herself that all
was well. But forty-eight hours since the always exactly calculated
time had now passed, and there had been no sign. And for four days
preceding this Clyde had not even been near her. And his attitude
at the factory was more remote and indifferent than ever.</p>

<p>And now, this!</p>

<p>And she had no one but him to whom she might turn. And he was in
this estranged and indifferent mood.</p>

<p>Because of her fright, induced by the fear that with or without
Clyde's aid she might not easily be extricated from her threatened
predicament, she could see her home, her mother, her relatives, all
who knew her, and their thoughts in case anything like this should
befall her. For of the opinion of society in general and what other
people might say, Roberta stood in extreme terror. The stigma of
unsanctioned concupiscence! The shame of illegitimacy for a child!
It was bad enough, as she had always thought, listening to girls
and women talk of life and marriage and adultery and the miseries
that had befallen girls who had yielded to men and subsequently
been deserted, for a woman when she was safely married and
sustained by the love and strength of a man&mdash;such love, for
instance, as her brother-in-law Gabel brought to her sister Agnes,
and her father to her mother in the first years, no doubt&mdash;and
Clyde to her when he had so feverishly declared that he loved
her.</p>

<p>But now&mdash;now!</p>

<p>She could not permit any thoughts in regard to his recent or
present attitude to delay her. Regardless of either, he must help
her. She did not know what else to do under such
circumstances&mdash; which way to turn. And no doubt Clyde did. At
any rate he had said once that he would stand by her in case
anything happened. And although, because at first, even on the
third day on reaching the factory, she imagined that she might be
exaggerating the danger and that it was perhaps some physical flaw
or lapse that might still overcome itself, still by late afternoon
no evidence of any change coming to her, she began to be a prey to
the most nameless terrors. What little courage she had mustered up
to this time began to waver and break. She was all alone, unless he
came to her now. And she was in need of advice and good
counsel&mdash;loving counsel. Oh, Clyde! Clyde! If he would only
not be so indifferent to her! He must not be! Something must be
done, and right away&mdash;quick&mdash;else&mdash;Great Heavens,
what a terrible thing this could easily come to be!</p>

<p>At once she stopped her work between four and five in the
afternoon and hurried to the dressing-room. And there she penned a
note&mdash; hurried, hysterical&mdash;a scrawl.</p>

<blockquote>"CLYDE&mdash;I must see you to-night, sure,
<i>sure</i>. You mustn't fail me. I have something to tell you.
Please come as soon after work as possible, or meet me anywhere.
I'm not angry or mad about anything. But I must see you to-night,
<i>sure</i>. Please say right away where.<br>
<br>
"ROBERTA."</blockquote>

<p>And he, sensing a new and strange and quite terrified note in
all this the moment he read it, at once looked over his shoulder at
her and, seeing her face so white and drawn, signaled that he would
meet her. For judging by her face the thing she had to tell must be
of the utmost importance to her, else why this tensity and
excitement on her part. And although he had another engagement
later, as he now troublesomely recalled, at the Starks for dinner,
still it was necessary to do this first. Yet, what was it anyhow?
Was anybody dead or hurt or what&mdash;her mother or father or
brother or sister?</p>

<p>At five-thirty, he made his way to the appointed place,
wondering what it could be that could make her so pale and
concerned. Yet at the same time saying to himself that if this
other dream in regard to Sondra were to come true he must not let
himself be reentangled by any great or moving sympathy&mdash;must
maintain his new poise and distance so that Roberta could see that
he no longer cared for her as he had. Reaching the appointed place
at six o'clock, he found her leaning disconsolately against a tree
in the shadow. She looked distraught, despondent.</p>

<p>"Why, what's the matter, Bert? What are you so frightened about?
What's happened?"</p>

<p>Even his obviously dwindling affection was restimulated by her
quite visible need of help.</p>

<p>"Oh, Clyde," she said at last, "I hardly know how to tell you.
It's so terrible for me if it's so." Her voice, tense and yet low,
was in itself a clear proof of her anguish and uncertainty.</p>

<p>"Why, what is it, Bert? Why don't you tell me?" he reiterated,
briskly and yet cautiously, essaying an air of detached assurance
which he could not quite manage in this instance. "What's wrong?
What are you so excited about? You're all trembly."</p>

<p>Because of the fact that never before in all his life had he
been confronted by any such predicament as this, it did not even
now occur to him just what the true difficulty could be. At the
same time, being rather estranged and hence embarrassed by his
recent treatment of her, he was puzzled as to just what attitude to
assume in a situation where obviously something was wrong. Being
sensitive to conventional or moral stimuli as he still was, he
could not quite achieve a discreditable thing, even where his own
highest ambitions were involved, without a measure of regret or at
least shame. Also he was so anxious to keep his dinner engagement
and not to be further involved that his manner was impatient. It
did not escape Roberta.</p>

<p>"You know, Clyde," she pleaded, both earnestly and eagerly, the
very difficulty of her state encouraging her to be bold and
demanding, "you said if anything went wrong you'd help me."</p>

<p>At once, because of those recent few and, as he now saw them,
foolish visits to her room, on which occasions because of some
remaining sentiment and desire on the part of both he had been
betrayed into sporadic and decidedly unwise physical relations with
her, he now realized what the difficulty was. And that it was a
severe, compelling, dangerous difficulty, if it were true. Also
that he was to blame and that here was a real predicament that must
be overcome, and that quickly, unless a still greater danger was to
be faced. Yet, simultaneously, his very recent and yet decidedly
compelling indifference dictating, he was almost ready now to
assume that this might be little more than a ruse or lovelorn
device or bit of strategy intended to retain or reenlist his
interest in spite of himself&mdash;a thought which he was only in
part ready to harbor. Her manner was too dejected and despairing.
And with the first dim realization of how disastrous such a
complication as this might prove to be in his case, he began to be
somewhat more alarmed than irritated. So much so that he
exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Yes, but how do you know that there is anything wrong? You
can't be sure so soon as all this, can you? How can you? You'll
probably be all right to-morrow, won't you?" At the same time his
voice was beginning to suggest the uncertainty that he felt.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, I don't think so, Clyde. I wish I did. It's two whole
days, and it's never been that way before."</p>

<p>Her manner as she said this was so obviously dejected and
self-commiserating that at once he was compelled to dismiss the
thought of intrigue. At the same time, unwilling to face so
discouraging a fact so soon, he added: "Oh, well, that might not
mean anything, either. Girls go longer than two days, don't
they?"</p>

<p>The tone, implying as it did uncertainty and non-sophistication
even, which previously had not appeared characteristic of him, was
sufficient to alarm Roberta to the point where she exclaimed: "Oh,
no, I don't think so. Anyhow, it would be terrible, wouldn't it, if
something were wrong? What do you suppose I ought to do? Don't you
know something I can take?"</p>

<p>At once Clyde, who had been so brisk and urgent in establishing
this relationship and had given Roberta the impression that he was
a sophisticated and masterful youth who knew much more of life than
ever she could hope to know, and to whom all such dangers and
difficulties as were implied in the relationship could be left with
impunity, was at a loss what to do. Actually, as he himself now
realized, he was as sparingly informed in regard to the mysteries
of sex and the possible complications attending upon such a
situation as any youth of his years could well be. True, before
coming here he had browsed about Kansas City and Chicago with such
worldly-wise mentors of the hotel bell-boy world as Ratterer,
Higby, Hegglund and others and had listened to much of their
gossiping and boasting. But their knowledge, for all their
boasting, as he now half guessed, must have related to girls who
were as careless and uninformed as themselves. And beyond those
again, although he was by no means so clearly aware of that fact
now, lay little more than those rumored specifics and preventatives
of such quack doctors and shady druggists and chemists as dealt
with intelligences of the Hegglund and Ratterer order. But even so,
where were such things to be obtained in a small city like
Lycurgus? Since dropping Dillard he had no intimates let alone
trustworthy friends who could be depended on to help in such a
crisis.</p>

<p>The best he could think of for the moment was to visit some
local or near-by druggist who might, for a price, provide him with
some worth-while prescription or information. But for how much? And
what were the dangers in connection with such a proceeding? Did
they talk? Did they ask questions? Did they tell any one else about
such inquiries or needs? He looked so much like Gilbert Griffiths,
who was so well known in Lycurgus that any one recognizing him as
Gilbert might begin to talk of him in that way and so bring about
trouble.</p>

<p>And this terrible situation arising now&mdash;when in connection
with Sondra, things had advanced to the point where she was now
secretly permitting him to kiss her, and, more pleasing still,
exhibiting little evidences of her affection and good will in the
form of presents of ties, a gold pencil, a box of most attractive
handkerchiefs, all delivered to his door in his absence with a
little card with her initials, which had caused him to feel sure
that his future in connection with her was of greater and greater
promise. So much so that even marriage, assuming that her family
might not prove too inimical and that her infatuation and diplomacy
endured, might not be beyond the bounds of possibility. He could
not be sure, of course. Her true intentions and affections so far
were veiled behind a tantalizing evasiveness which made her all the
more desirable. Yet it was these things that had been causing him
to feel that he must now, and speedily, extract himself as
gracefully and unirritatingly as possible from his intimacy with
Roberta.</p>

<p>For that reason, therefore, he now announced, with pretended
assurance: "Well, I wouldn't worry about it any more to-night if I
were you. You may be all right yet, you know. You can't be sure.
Anyhow, I'll have to have a little time until I can see what I can
do. I think I can get something for you. But I wish you wouldn't
get so excited."</p>

<p>At the same time he was far from feeling as secure as he
sounded. In fact he was very much shaken. His original
determination to have as little to do with her as possible, was now
complicated by the fact that he was confronted by a predicament
that spelled real danger to himself, unless by some argument or
assertion he could absolve himself of any responsibility in
connection with this&mdash;a possibility which, in view of the fact
that Roberta still worked for him, that he had written her some
notes, and that any least word from her would precipitate an
inquiry which would prove fatal to him, was sufficient to cause him
to feel that he must assist her speedily and without a breath of
information as to all this leaking out in any direction. At the
same time it is only fair to say that because of all that had been
between them, he did not object to assisting her in any way that he
could. But in the event that he could not (it was so that his
thoughts raced forward to an entirely possible inimical conclusion
to all this) well, then&mdash;well, then&mdash; might it not be
possible at least&mdash;some fellows, if not himself would&mdash;to
deny that he had held any such relationship with her and so escape.
That possibly might be one way out&mdash;if only he were not as
treacherously surrounded as he was here.</p>

<p>But the most troublesome thing in connection with all this was
the thought that he knew of nothing that would really avail in such
a case, other than a doctor. Also that that probably meant money,
time, danger&mdash;just what did it mean? He would see her in the
morning, and if she weren't all right by then he would act.</p>

<p>And Roberta, for the first time forsaken in this rather casual
and indifferent way, and in such a crisis as this, returned to her
room with her thoughts and fears, more stricken and agonized than
ever before she had been in all her life.</p>

<h3>Chapter 34</h3>

<p>But the resources of Clyde, in such a situation as this, were
slim. For, apart from Liggett, Whiggam, and a few minor though
decidedly pleasant and yet rather remote department heads, all of
whom were now looking on him as a distinctly superior person who
could scarcely be approached too familiarly in connection with
anything, there was no one to whom he could appeal. In so far as
the social group to which he was now so eagerly attaching himself
was concerned, it would have been absurd for him to attempt,
however slyly, to extract any information there. For while the
youths of this world at least were dashing here and there, and
because of their looks, taste and means indulging themselves in
phases of libertinism&mdash;the proper wild oats of
youth&mdash;such as he and others like himself could not have
dreamed of affording, still so far was he from any real intimacy
with any of these that he would not have dreamed of approaching
them for helpful information.</p>

<p>His sanest thought, which occurred to him almost immediately
after leaving Roberta, was that instead of inquiring of any
druggist or doctor or person in Lycurgus&mdash;more particularly
any doctor, since the entire medical profession here, as elsewhere,
appeared to him as remote, cold, unsympathetic and likely very
expensive and unfriendly to such an immoral adventure as
this&mdash;was to go to some near-by city, preferably Schenectady,
since it was larger and as near as any, and there inquire what, if
anything, could be obtained to help in such a situation as this.
For he must find something.</p>

<p>At the same time, the necessity for decision and prompt action
was so great that even on his way to the Starks', and without
knowing any drug or prescription to ask for, he resolved to go to
Schenectady the next night. Only that meant, as he later reasoned,
that a whole day must elapse before anything could be done for
Roberta, and that, in her eyes, as well as his own, would be
leaving her open to the danger that any delay at all involved.
Therefore, he decided to act at once, if he could; excuse himself
to the Starks and then make the trip to Schenectady on the
interurban before the drug-stores over there should close. But once
there&mdash;what? How face the local druggist or clerk&mdash;and
ask for what? His mind was troubled with hard, abrasive thoughts as
to what the druggist might think, look or say. If only Ratterer or
Hegglund were here! They would know, of course, and be glad to help
him. Or Higby, even. But here he was now, all alone, for Roberta
knew nothing at all. There must be something though, of course. If
not, if he failed there, he would return and write Ratterer in
Chicago, only in order to keep himself out of this as much as
possible he would say that he was writing for a friend.</p>

<p>Once in Schenectady, since no one knew him there, of course he
might say (the thought came to him as an inspiration) that he was a
newly married man&mdash;why not? He was old enough to be one, and
that his wife, and that in the face of inability to care for a
child now, was "past her time" (he recalled a phrase that he had
once heard Higby use), and that he wanted something that would
permit her to escape from that state. What was so wrong with that
as an idea? A young married couple might be in just such a
predicament. And possibly the druggist would, or should be stirred
to a little sympathy by such a state and might be glad to tell him
of something. Why not? That would be no real crime. To be sure, one
and another might refuse, but a third might not. And then he would
be rid of this. And then never again, without knowing a lot more
than he did now, would he let himself drift into any such
predicament as this. Never! It was too dreadful.</p>

<p>He betook himself to the Stark house very nervous and growing
more so every moment. So much so that, the dinner being eaten, he
finally declared as early as nine-thirty that at the last moment at
the factory a very troublesome report, covering a whole month's
activities, had been requested of him. And since it was not
anything he could do at the office, he was compelled to return to
his room and make it out there&mdash;a bit of energetic and
ambitious commercialism, as the Starks saw it, worthy of their
admiration and sympathy. And in consequence he was excused.</p>

<p>But arrived at Schenectady, he had barely time to look around a
little before the last car for Lycurgus should be leaving. His
nerve began to fail him. Did he look enough like a young married
man to convince any one that he was one? Besides were not such
preventatives considered very wrong&mdash;even by druggists?</p>

<p>Walking up and down the one very long Main Street still brightly
lighted at this hour, looking now in one drug-store window and
another, he decided for different reasons that each particular one
was not the one. In one, as he saw at a glance, stood a stout,
sober, smooth-shaven man of fifty whose bespectacled eyes and iron
gray hair seemed to indicate to Clyde's mind that he would be most
certain to deny such a youthful applicant as himself&mdash;refuse
to believe that he was married&mdash;or to admit that he had any
such remedy, and suspect him of illicit relations with some young,
unmarried girl into the bargain. He looked so sober, God-fearing,
ultra-respectable and conventional. No, it would not do to apply to
him. He had not the courage to enter and face such a person.</p>

<p>In another drug-store he observed a small, shriveled and yet
dapper and shrewd-looking man of perhaps thirty-five, who appeared
to him at the time as satisfactory enough, only, as he could see
from the front, he was being briskly assisted by a young woman of
not more than twenty or twenty-five. And assuming that she would
approach him instead of the man&mdash;an embarrassing and
impossible situation&mdash; or if the man waited on him, was it not
probable that she would hear? In consequence he gave up that place,
and a third, a fourth, and a fifth, for varying and yet equally
cogent reasons&mdash;customers inside, a girl and a boy at a soda
fountain in front, an owner posed near the door and surveying Clyde
as he looked in and thus disconcerting him before he had time to
consider whether he should enter or not.</p>

<p>Finally, however, after having abandoned so many, he decided
that he must act or return defeated, his time and carfare wasted.
Returning to one of the lesser stores in a side street, in which a
moment before he had observed an undersized chemist idling about,
he entered, and summoning all the bravado he could muster, began:
"I want to know something. I want to know if you know of
anything&mdash; well, you see, it's this way&mdash;I'm just married
and my wife is past her time and I can't afford to have any
children now if I can help it. Is there anything a person can get
that will get her out of it?"</p>

<p>His manner was brisk and confidential enough, although tinged
with nervousness and the inner conviction that the druggist must
guess that he was lying. At the same time, although he did not know
it, he was talking to a confirmed religionist of the Methodist
group who did not believe in interfering with the motives or
impulses of nature. Any such trifling was against the laws of God
and he carried nothing in stock that would in any way interfere
with the ways of the Creator. At the same time he was too good a
merchant to wish to alienate a possible future customer, and so he
now said: "I'm sorry, young man, but I'm afraid I can't help you in
this case. I haven't a thing of that kind in stock here&mdash;never
handle anything of that kind because I don't believe in 'em. It may
be, though, that some of the other stores here in town carry
something of the sort. I wouldn't be able to tell you." His manner
as he spoke was solemn, the convinced and earnest tone and look of
the moralist who knows that he is right.</p>

<p>And at once Clyde gathered, and fairly enough in this instance,
that this man was reproachful. It reduced to a much smaller
quantity the little confidence with which he had begun his quest.
And yet, since the dealer had not directly reproached him and had
even said that it might be possible that some of the other
druggists carried such a thing, he took heart after a few moments,
and after a brief fit of pacing here and there in which he looked
through one window and another, he finally espied a seventh dealer
alone. He entered, and after repeating his first explanation he was
informed, very secretively and yet casually, by the thin, dark,
casuistic person who waited on him&mdash;not the owner in this
instance&mdash; that there was such a remedy. Yes. Did he wish a
box? That (because Clyde asked the price) would be six
dollars&mdash;a staggering sum to the salaried inquirer. However,
since the expenditure seemed unescapable&mdash;to find anything at
all a great relief&mdash;he at once announced that he would take
it, and the clerk, bringing him something which he hinted ought to
prove "effectual" and wrapping it up, he paid and went out.</p>

<p>And then actually so relieved was he, so great had been the
strain up to this moment, that he could have danced for joy. Then
there was a cure, and it would work, of course. The excessive and
even outrageous price seemed to indicate as much. And under the
circumstances, might he not even consider that sum moderate, seeing
that he was being let off so easily? However, he forgot to inquire
as to whether there was any additional information or special
direction that might prove valuable, and instead, with the package
in his pocket, some central and detached portion of the ego within
himself congratulating him upon his luck and undaunted efficiency
in such a crisis as this, he at once returned to Lycurgus, where he
proceeded to Roberta's room.</p>

<p>And she, like himself, impressed by his success in having
secured something which both he and she had feared did not exist,
or if it did, might prove difficult to procure, felt enormously
relieved. In fact, she was reimpressed by his ability and
efficiency, qualities with which, up to this time at least, she had
endowed him. Also that he was more generous and considerate than
under the circumstances she feared he would be. At least he was not
coldly abandoning her to fate, as previously in her terror she had
imagined that he might. And this fact, even in the face of his
previous indifference, was sufficient to soften her mood in regard
to him. So with a kind of ebullience, based on fattened hope
resting on the pills, she undid the package and read the
directions, assuring him the while of her gratitude and that she
would not forget how good he had been to her in this instance. At
the same time, even as she untied the package, the thought came to
her&mdash;supposing they would not work? Then what? And how would
she go about arranging with Clyde as to that? However, for the time
being, as she now reasoned, she must be satisfied and grateful for
this, and at once took one of the pills.</p>

<p>But once her expressions of gratefulness had been offered and
Clyde sensed that these same might possibly be looked upon as
overtures to a new intimacy between them, he fell back upon the
attitude that for days past had characterized him at the factory.
Under no circumstances must he lend himself to any additional
blandishments or languishments in this field. And if this drug
proved effectual, as he most earnestly hoped, it must be the last
of any save the most accidental and casual contacts. For there was
too much danger, as this particular crisis had proved&mdash;too
much to be lost on his side&mdash;everything, in
short&mdash;nothing but worry and trouble and expense.</p>

<p>In consequence he retreated to his former reserve. "Well, you'll
be all right now, eh? Anyhow, let's hope so, huh? It says to take
one every two hours for eight or ten hours. And if you're just a
little sick, it says it doesn't make any difference. You may have
to knock off a day or two at the factory, but you won't mind that,
will you, if it gets you out of this? I'll come around to-morrow
night and see how you are, if you don't show up any time
to-morrow."</p>

<p>He laughed genially, the while Roberta gazed at him, unable to
associate his present casual attitude with his former passion and
deep solicitude. His former passion! And now this! And yet, under
the circumstances, being truly grateful, she now smiled cordially
and he the same. Yet, seeing him go out, the door close, and no
endearing demonstrations of any kind having been exchanged between
them, she returned to her bed, shaking her head dubiously. For,
supposing that this remedy did not work after all? And he continued
in this same casual and remote attitude toward her? Then what? For
unless this remedy proved effectual, he might still be so
indifferent that he might not want to help her long&mdash;or would
he? Could he do that, really? He was the one who had brought her to
this difficulty, and against her will, and he had so definitely
assured her that nothing would happen. And now she must lie here
alone and worry, not a single person to turn to, except him, and he
was leaving her for others with the assurance that she would be all
right. And he had caused it all! Was this quite right?</p>

<p>"Oh, Clyde! Clyde!"</p>

<h3>Chapter 35</h3>

<p>But the remedy he purchased failed to work. And because of
nausea and his advice she had not gone to the factory, but lay
about worrying. But, no saving result appearing, she began to take
two pills every hour instead of one&mdash;eager at any cost to
escape the fate which seemingly had overtaken her. And this made
her exceedingly sick&mdash;so much so that when Clyde arrived at
six-thirty he was really moved by her deathly white face, drawn
cheeks and large and nervous eyes, the pupils of which were unduly
dilated. Obviously she was facing a crisis, and because of him,
and, while it frightened, at the same time it made him sorry for
her. Still, so confused and perplexed was he by the problem which
her unchanged state presented to him that his mind now leaped
forward to the various phases and eventualities of such a failure
as this. The need of additional advice or service of some physician
somewhere! But where and how and who? And besides, as he now asked
himself, where was he to obtain the money in any such event?</p>

<p>Plainly in view of no other inspiration it was necessary for him
to return to the druggist at once and there inquire if there was
anything else&mdash;some other drug or some other thing that one
might do. Or if not that, then some low-priced shady doctor
somewhere, who, for a small fee, or a promise of payments on time,
would help in this case.</p>

<p>Yet even though this other matter was so important&mdash;tragic
almost&mdash; once outside his spirits lifted slightly. For he now
recalled that he had an appointment with Sondra at the Cranstons',
where at nine he and she, along with a number of others, were to
meet and play about as usual&mdash;a party. Yet once at the
Cranstons', and despite the keen allurement of Sondra, he could not
keep his mind off Roberta's state, which rose before him as a
specter. Supposing now any one of those whom he found gathered
here&mdash;Nadine Harriet, Perley Haynes, Violet Taylor, Jill
Trumbull, Bella, Bertine, and Sondra, should gain the least inkling
of the scene he had just witnessed? In spite of Sondra at the piano
throwing him a welcoming smile over her shoulder as he entered, his
thoughts were on Roberta. He must go around there again after this
was over, to see how she was and so relieve his own mind in case
she were better. In case she was not, he must write to Ratterer at
once for advice.</p>

<p>In spite of his distress he was trying to appear as gay and
unconcerned as ever&mdash;dancing first with Perley Haynes and then
with Nadine and finally, while waiting for a chance to dance with
Sondra, he approached a group who were trying to help Vanda Steele
solve a new scenery puzzle and asserted that he could read messages
written on paper and sealed in envelopes (the old serial letter
trick which he had found explained in an ancient book of parlor
tricks discovered on a shelf at the Peytons'). It had been his plan
to use it before in order to give himself an air of ease and
cleverness, but to-night he was using it to take his mind off the
greater problem that was weighing on him. And, although with the
aid of Nadine Harriet, whom he took into his confidence, he
succeeded in thoroughly mystifying the others, still his mind was
not quite on it. Roberta was always there. Supposing something
should really be wrong with her and he could not get her out of it.
She might even expect him to marry her, so fearful was she of her
parents and people. What would he do then? He would lose the
beautiful Sondra and she might even come to know how and why he had
lost her. But that would be wild of Roberta to expect him to do
that. He would not do it. He could not do it.</p>

<p>One thing was certain. He must get her out of this. He must! But
how? How?</p>

<p>And although at twelve o'clock Sondra signaled that she was
ready to go and that if he chose he might accompany her to her door
(and even stop in for a few moments) and although once there, in
the shade of a pergola which ornamented the front gate, she had
allowed him to kiss her and told him that she was beginning to
think he was the nicest ever and that the following spring when the
family moved to Twelfth Lake she was going to see if she couldn't
think of some way by which she could arrange to have him there over
week-ends, still, because of this pressing problem in connection
with Roberta, Clyde was so worried that he was not able to
completely enjoy this new and to him exquisitely thrilling
demonstration of affection on her part&mdash;this new and amazing
social and emotional victory of his.</p>

<p>He must send that letter to Ratterer to-night. But before that
he must return to Roberta as he had promised and find out if she
was better. And after that he must go over to Schenectady in the
morning, sure, to see the druggist over there. For something must
be done about this unless she were better to-night.</p>

<p>And so, with Sondra's kisses thrilling on his lips, he left her
to go to Roberta, whose white face and troubled eyes told him as he
entered her room that no change had taken place. If anything she
was worse and more distressed than before, the larger dosage having
weakened her to the point of positive illness. However, as she
said, nothing mattered if only she could get out of this&mdash;that
she would almost be willing to die rather than face the
consequences. And Clyde, realizing what she meant and being so
sincerely concerned for himself, appeared in part distressed for
her. However, his previous indifference and the manner in which he
had walked off and left her alone this very evening prevented her
from feeling that there was any abiding concern in him for her now.
And this grieved her terribly. For she sensed now that he did not
really care for her any more, even though now he was saying that
she mustn't worry and that it was likely that if these didn't work
he would get something else that would; that he was going back to
the druggist at Schenectady the first thing in the morning to see
if there wasn't something else that he could suggest.</p>

<p>But the Gilpins had no telephone, and since he never ventured to
call at her room during the day and he never permitted her to call
him at Mrs. Peyton's, his plan in this instance was to pass by the
following morning before work. If she were all right, the two front
shades would be raised to the top; if not, then lowered to the
center. In that case he would depart for Schenectady at once,
telephoning Mr. Liggett that he had some outside duties to
perform.</p>

<p>Just the same, both were terribly depressed and fearful as to
what this should mean for each of them. Clyde could not quite
assure himself that, in the event that Roberta was not extricated,
he would be able to escape without indemnifying her in some form
which might not mean just temporary efforts to aid her, but
something more&mdash;marriage, possibly&mdash;since already she had
reminded him that he had promised to see her through. But what had
he really meant by that at the time that he said it, he now asked
himself. Not marriage, most certainly, since his thought was not
that he had ever wanted to marry her, but rather just to play with
her happily in love, although, as he well knew, she had no such
conception of his eager mood at that time. He was compelled to
admit to himself that she had probably thought his intentions were
more serious or she would not have submitted to him at all.</p>

<p>But reaching home, and after writing and mailing the letter to
Ratterer, Clyde passed a troubled night. Next morning he paid a
visit to the druggist at Schenectady, the curtains of Roberta's
windows having been lowered to the center when he passed. But on
this occasion the latter had no additional aid to offer other than
the advisability of a hot and hence weakening bath, which he had
failed to mention in the first instance. Also some wearying form of
physical exercise. But noting Clyde's troubled expression and
judging that the situation was causing him great worry, he
observed: "Of course, the fact that your wife has skipped a month
doesn't mean that there is anything seriously wrong, you know.
Women do that sometimes. Anyhow, you can't ever be sure until the
second month has passed. Any doctor will tell you that. If she's
nervous, let her try something like this. But even if it fails to
work, you can't be positive. She might be all right next month just
the same."</p>

<p>Thinly cheered by this information, Clyde was about to depart,
for Roberta might be wrong. He and she might be worrying
needlessly. Still&mdash;he was brought up with a round turn as he
thought of it&mdash; there might be real danger, and waiting until
the end of the second period would only mean that a whole month had
elapsed and nothing helpful accomplished&mdash;a freezing thought.
In consequence he now observed: "In case things don't come right,
you don't happen to know of a doctor she could go to, do you? This
is rather a serious business for both of us, and I'd like to get
her out of it if I could."</p>

<p>Something about the way in which Clyde said this&mdash;his
extreme nervousness as well as his willingness to indulge in a form
of malpractice which the pharmacist by some logic all his own
considered very different from just swallowing a preparation
intended to achieve the same result&mdash;caused him to look
suspiciously at Clyde, the thought stirring in his brain that very
likely after all Clyde was not married, also that this was one of
those youthful affairs which spelled license and future difficulty
for some unsophisticated girl. Hence his mood now changed, and
instead of being willing to assist, he now said coolly: "Well,
there may be a doctor around here, but if so I don't know. And I
wouldn't undertake to send any one to a doctor like that. It's
against the law. It would certainly go hard with any doctor around
here who was caught doing that sort of thing. That's not to say,
though, that you aren't at liberty to look around for yourself, if
you want to," he added gravely, giving Clyde a suspicious and
examining glance, and deciding it were best if he had nothing
further to do with such a person.</p>

<p>Clyde therefore returned to Roberta with the same prescription
renewed, although she had most decidedly protested that, since the
first box had not worked, it was useless to get more. But since he
insisted, she was willing to try the drug the new way, although the
argument that a cold or nerves was the possible cause was only
sufficient to convince her that Clyde was at the end of his
resources in so far as she was concerned, or if not that, he was
far from being alive to the import of this both to herself and to
him. And supposing this new treatment did not work, then what? Was
he going to stop now and let the thing rest there?</p>

<p>Yet so peculiar was Clyde's nature that in the face of his fears
in regard to his future, and because it was far from pleasant to be
harried in this way and an infringement on his other interests, the
assurance that the delay of a month might not prove fatal was
sufficient to cause him to be willing to wait, and that rather
indifferently, for that length of time. Roberta might be wrong. She
might be making all this trouble for nothing. He must see how she
felt after she had tried this new way.</p>

<p>But the treatment failed. Despite the fact that in her distress
Roberta returned to the factory in order to weary herself, until
all the girls in the department assured her that she must be
ill&mdash; that she should not be working when she looked and
plainly felt so bad&mdash;still nothing came of it. And the fact
that Clyde could dream of falling back on the assurance of the
druggist that a first month's lapse was of no import only
aggravated and frightened her the more.</p>

<p>The truth was that in this crisis he was as interesting an
illustration of the enormous handicaps imposed by ignorance, youth,
poverty and fear as one could have found. Technically he did not
even know the meaning of the word "midwife," or the nature of the
services performed by her. (And there were three here in Lycurgus
at this time in the foreign family section.) Again, he had been in
Lycurgus so short a time, and apart from the young society men and
Dillard whom he had cut, and the various department heads at the
factory, he knew no one&mdash;an occasional barber, haberdasher,
cigar dealer and the like, the majority of whom, as he saw them,
were either too dull or too ignorant for his purpose.</p>

<p>One thing, however, which caused him to pause before ever he
decided to look up a physician was the problem of who was to
approach him and how. To go himself was simply out of the question.
In the first place, he looked too much like Gilbert Griffiths, who
was decidedly too well-known here and for whom he might be
mistaken. Next, it was unquestionable that, being as well-dressed
as he was, the physician would want to charge him more, maybe, than
he could afford and ask him all sorts of embarrassing questions,
whereas if it could be arranged through some one else&mdash;the
details explained before ever Roberta was sent&mdash; Why not
Roberta herself! Why not? She looked so simple and innocent and
unassuming and appealing at all times. And in such a situation as
this, as depressed and downcast as she was, well...For after all,
as he now casuistically argued with himself, it was she and not he
who was facing the immediate problem which had to be solved.</p>

<p>And again, as it now came to him, would she not be able to get
it done cheaper? For looking as she did now, so distrait&mdash;If
only he could get her to say that she had been deserted by some
young man, whose name she would refuse to divulge, of course, well,
what physician seeing a girl like her alone and in such a
state&mdash;no one to look after her&mdash;would refuse her? It
might even be that he would help her out for nothing. Who could
tell? And that would leave him clear of it all.</p>

<p>And in consequence he now approached Roberta, intending to
prepare her for the suggestion that, assuming that he could provide
a physician and the nature of his position being what it was, she
must speak for herself. But before he had spoken she at once
inquired of him as to what, if anything, more he had heard or done.
Wasn't some other remedy sold somewhere? And this giving him the
opportunity he desired, he explained: "Well, I've asked around and
looked into most of the drug-stores and they tell me if this one
won't work that none will. That leaves me sorta stumped now, unless
you're willing to go and see a doctor. But the trouble with that is
they're hard to find&mdash;the ones who'll do anything and keep
their mouths shut. I've talked with several fellows without saying
who it's for, of course, but it ain't so easy to get one around
here, because they are all too much afraid. It's against the law,
you see. But what I want to know now is, supposing I find a doctor
who would do it, will you have the nerve to go and see him and tell
him what the trouble is? That's what I want to know."</p>

<p>She looked at him dazedly, not quite grasping that he was
hinting that she was to go entirely alone, but rather assuming that
of course he meant to go with her. Then, her mind concentrating
nervously upon the necessity of facing a doctor in his company, she
first exclaimed: "Oh, dear, isn't it terrible to think of us having
to go to a doctor in this way? Then he'll know all about us, won't
he? And besides it's dangerous, isn't it, although I don't suppose
it could be much worse than those old pills." She went off into
more intimate inquiries as to what was done and how, but Clyde
could not enlighten her.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't be getting nervous over that now," he said. "It isn't
anything that's going to hurt you, I know. Besides we'll be lucky
if we find some one to do it. What I want to know is if I do find a
doctor, will you be willing to go to him alone?" She started as if
struck, but unabashed now he went on, "As things stand with me
here, I can't go with you, that's sure. I'm too well known around
here, and besides I look too much like Gilbert and he's known to
everybody. If I should be mistaken for him, or be taken for his
cousin or relative, well, then the jig's up."</p>

<p>His eyes were not only an epitome of how wretched he would feel
were he exposed to all Lycurgus for what he was, but also in them
lurked a shadow of the shabby role he was attempting to play in
connection with her&mdash;in hiding thus completely behind her
necessity. And yet so tortured was he by the fear of what was about
to befall him in case he did not succeed in so doing, that he was
now prepared, whatever Roberta might think or say, to stand his
ground. But Roberta, sensing only the fact that he was thinking of
sending her alone, now exclaimed incredulously: "Not alone, Clyde!
Oh, no, I couldn't do that! Oh, dear, no! Why, I'd be frightened to
death. Oh, dear, no. Why, I'd be so frightened I wouldn't know what
to do. Just think how I'd feel, trying to explain to him alone. I
just couldn't do that. Besides, how would I know what to
say&mdash;how to begin? You'll just have to go with me at first,
that's all, and explain, or I never can go&mdash;I don't care what
happens." Her eyes were round and excited and her face, while
registering all the depression and fear that had recently been
there, was transfigured by definite opposition.</p>

<p>But Clyde was not to be shaken either.</p>

<p>"You know how it is with me here, Bert. I can't go, and that's
all there is to it. Why, supposing I were seen&mdash;supposing some
one should recognize me? What then? You know how much I've been
going around here since I've been here. Why, it's crazy to think
that I could go. Besides, it will be a lot easier for you than for
me. No doctor's going to think anything much of your coming to him,
especially if you're alone. He'll just think you're some one who's
got in trouble and with no one to help you. But if I go, and it
should be any one who knows anything about the Griffiths, there'd
be the deuce to pay. Right off he'd think I was stuffed with money.
Besides, if I didn't do just what he wanted me to do afterwards, he
could go to my uncle, or my cousin, and then, good night! That
would be the end of me. And if I lost my place here now, and with
no money and that kind of scandal connected with me, where do you
suppose I would be after that, or you either? I certainly couldn't
look after you then. And then what would you do? I should think
you'd wake up and see what a tough proposition this is. My name
can't be pulled into this without trouble for both of us. It's got
to be kept out, that's all, and the only way for me to keep it out
is for me to stay away from any doctor. Besides, he'd feel a lot
sorrier for you than he would for me. You can't tell me!"</p>

<p>His eyes were distressed and determined, and, as Roberta could
gather from his manner, a certain hardness, or at least defiance,
the result of fright, showed in every gesture. He was determined to
protect his own name, come what might&mdash;a fact which, because
of her own acquiescence up to this time, still carried great weight
with her.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear! dear!" she exclaimed, nervously and sadly now, the
growing and drastic terror of the situation dawning upon her, "I
don't see how we are to do then. I really don't. For I can't do
that and that's all there is to it. It's all so hard&mdash;so
terrible. I'd feel too much ashamed and frightened to ever go
alone."</p>

<p>But even as she said this she began to feel that she might, and
even would, go alone, if must be. For what else was there to do?
And how was she to compel him, in the face of his own fears and
dangers, to jeopardize his position here? He began once more, in
self-defense more than from any other motive:</p>

<p>"Besides, unless this thing isn't going to cost very much, I
don't see how I'm going to get by with it anyhow, Bert. I really
don't. I don't make so very much, you know&mdash;only twenty-five
dollars up to now." (Necessity was at last compelling him to speak
frankly with Roberta.) "And I haven't saved anything&mdash;not a
cent. And you know why as well as I do. We spent the most of it
together. Besides if I go and he thought I had money, he might want
to charge me more than I could possibly dig up. But if you go and
just tell him how things are&mdash;and that you haven't got
anything&mdash;if you'd only say I'd run away or something,
see&mdash;"</p>

<p>He paused because, as he said it, he saw a flicker of shame,
contempt, despair at being connected with anything so cheap and
shabby, pass over Roberta's face. And yet in spite of this sly and
yet muddy tergiversation on his part&mdash;so great is the
compelling and enlightening power of necessity&mdash;she could
still see that there was some point to his argument. He might be
trying to use her as a foil, a mask, behind which he, and she too
for that matter, was attempting to hide. But just the same,
shameful as it was, here were the stark, bald headlands of fact,
and at their base the thrashing, destroying waves of necessity. She
heard him say: "You wouldn't have to give your right name, you
know, or where you came from. I don't intend to pick out any doctor
right around here, see. Then, if you'd tell him you didn't have
much money&mdash;just your weekly salary&mdash;"</p>

<p>She sat down weakly to think, the while this persuasive trickery
proceeded from him&mdash;the import of most of his argument going
straight home. For as false and morally meretricious as this whole
plan was, still, as she could see for herself, her own as well as
Clyde's situation was desperate. And as honest and punctilious as
she might ordinarily be in the matter of truth-telling and
honest-dealing, plainly this was one of those whirling tempests of
fact and reality in which the ordinary charts and compasses of
moral measurement were for the time being of small use.</p>

<p>And so, insisting then that they go to some doctor far away,
Utica or Albany, maybe&mdash;but still admitting by this that she
would go&mdash; the conversation was dropped. And he having
triumphed in the matter of excepting his own personality from this,
took heart to the extent, at least, of thinking that at once now,
by some hook or crook, he must find a doctor to whom he could send
her. Then his terrible troubles in connection with all this would
be over. And after that she could go her way, as surely she must;
then, seeing that he would have done all that he could for her he
would go his way to the glorious denouement that lay directly
before him in case only this were adjusted.</p>

<h3>Chapter 36</h3>

<p>Nevertheless hours and even days, and finally a week and then
ten days, passed without any word from him as to the whereabouts of
a doctor to whom she could go. For although having said so much to
her he still did not know to whom to apply. And each hour and day
as great a menace to him as to her. And her looks as well as her
inquiries registering how intense and vital and even clamorous at
moments was her own distress. Also he was harried almost to the
point of nervous collapse by his own inability to think of any
speedy and sure way by which she might be aided. Where did a
physician live to whom he might send her with some assurance of
relief for her, and how was he to find out about him?</p>

<p>After a time, however, in running over all the names of those he
knew, he finally struck upon a forlorn hope in the guise of Orrin
Short, the young man conducting the one small "gents' furnishing
store" in Lycurgus which catered more or less exclusively to the
rich youths of the city&mdash;a youth of about his own years and
proclivities, as Clyde had guessed, who ever since he had been here
had been useful to him in the matter of tips as to dress and style
in general. Indeed, as Clyde had for some time noted, Short was a
brisk, inquiring and tactful person, who, in addition to being
quite attractive personally to girls, was also always most
courteous to his patrons, particularly to those whom he considered
above him in the social scale, and among these was Clyde. For
having discovered that Clyde was related to the Griffiths, this
same Short had sought, as a means for his own general advancement
in other directions, to scrape as much of a genial and intimate
relationship with him as possible, only, as Clyde saw it, and in
view of the general attitude of his very high relatives, it had
not, up to this time at least, been possible for him to consider
any such intimacy seriously. And yet, finding Short so very affable
and helpful in general, he was not above reaching at least an easy
and genial surface relationship with him, which Short appeared to
accept in good part. Indeed, as at first, his manner remained
seeking and not a little sycophantic at times. And so it was that
among all those with whom he could be said to be in either intimate
or casual contact, Short was about the only one who offered even a
chance for an inquiry which might prove productive of some helpful
information.</p>

<p>In consequence, in passing Short's place each evening and
morning, once he thought of him in this light, he made it a point
to nod and smile in a most friendly manner, until at least three
days had gone by. And then, feeling that he had paved the way as
much as his present predicament would permit, he stopped in, not at
all sure that on this first occasion he would be able to broach the
dangerous subject. The tale he had fixed upon to tell Short was
that he had been approached by a young working-man in the factory,
newly-married, who, threatened with an heir and not being able to
afford one as yet, had appealed to him for information as to where
he might now find a doctor to help him. The only interesting
additions which Clyde proposed to make to this were that the young
man, being very poor and timid and not so very intelligent, was not
able to speak or do much for himself. Also that he, Clyde, being
better informed, although so new locally as not to be able to
direct him to any physician (an after-thought intended to put the
idea into Short's mind that he himself was never helpless and so
not likely ever to want such advice himself), had already advised
the young man of a temporary remedy. But unfortunately, so his
story was to run, this had already failed to work. Hence something
more certain&mdash;a physician, no less&mdash;was necessary. And
Short, having been here longer, and, as he had heard him explain,
hailing previously from Gloversville, it was quite certain, as
Clyde now argued with himself, that he would know of at least
one&mdash;or should. But in order to divert suspicion from himself
he was going to add that of course he probably could get news of
some one in his own set, only, the situation being so unusual (any
reference to any such thing in his own world being likely to set
his own group talking), he preferred to ask some one like Short,
who as a favor would keep it quiet.</p>

<p>As it chanced on this occasion, Short himself, owing to his
having done a very fair day's business, was in an exceedingly
jovial frame of mind. And Clyde having entered, to buy a pair of
socks, perhaps, he began: "Well, it's good to see you again, Mr.
Griffiths. How are you? I was just thinking it's about time you
stopped in and let me show you some of the things I got in since
you were here before. How are things with the Griffiths Company
anyhow?"</p>

<p>Short's manner, always brisk, was on this occasion doubly
reassuring, since he liked Clyde, only now the latter was so
intensely keyed up by the daring of his own project that he could
scarcely bring himself to carry the thing off with the air he would
have liked to have employed.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, being in the store and so, seemingly, committed to
the project, he now began: "Oh, pretty fair. Can't kick a bit. I
always have all I can do, you know." At the same time he began
nervously fingering some ties hung upon movable nickeled rods. But
before he had wasted a moment on these, Mr. Short, turning and
spreading some boxes of very special ties from a shelf behind him
on the glass case, remarked: "Never mind looking at those, Mr.
Griffiths. Look at these. These are what I want to show you and
they won't cost <i>you</i> any more. Just got 'em in from New York
this morning." He picked up several bundles of six each, the very
latest, as he explained. "See anything else like this anywhere
around here yet? I'll say you haven't." He eyed Clyde smilingly,
the while he wished sincerely that such a young man, so well
connected, yet not rich like the others, would be friends with him.
It would place him here.</p>

<p>Clyde, fingering the offerings and guessing that what Short was
saying was true, was now so troubled and confused in his own mind
that he could scarcely think and speak as planned. "Very nice,
sure," he said, turning them over, feeling that at another time he
would have been pleased to possess at least two. "I think maybe
I'll take this one, anyhow, and this one, too." He drew out two and
held them up, while he was thinking how to broach the so much more
important matter that had brought him here. For why should he be
troubling to buy ties, dilly-dallying in this way, when all he
wanted to ask Short about was this other matter? Yet how hard it
was now&mdash;how very hard. And yet he really must, although
perhaps not so abruptly. He would look around a little more at
first in order to allay suspicion&mdash;ask about some socks. Only
why should he be doing that, since he did not need anything, Sondra
only recently having presented him with a dozen handkerchiefs, some
collars, ties and socks. Nevertheless every time he decided to
speak he felt a sort of sinking sensation at the pit of his
stomach, a fear that he could not or would not carry the thing off
with the necessary ease and conviction. It was all so questionable
and treacherous&mdash;so likely to lead to exposure and disgrace in
some way. He would probably not be able to bring himself to speak
to Short to-night. And yet, as he argued with himself, how could
the occasion ever be more satisfactory?</p>

<p>Short, in the meantime having gone to the rear of the store and
now returning, with a most engaging and even sycophantic smile on
his face, began with: "Saw you last Tuesday evening about nine
o'clock going into the Finchleys' place, didn't I? Beautiful house
and grounds they have there."</p>

<p>Clyde saw that Short really was impressed by his social station
here. There was a wealth of admiration mingled with a touch of
servility. And at once, because of this, he took heart, since he
realized that with such an attitude dominating the other, whatever
he might say would be colored in part at least by his admirer's awe
and respect. And after examining the socks and deciding that one
pair at least would soften the difficulty of his demand, he added:
"Oh, by the way, before I forget it. There's something I've been
wanting to ask you about. Maybe you can tell me what I want to
know. One of the boys at the factory&mdash;a young fellow who
hasn't been married very long&mdash;about four months now, I
guess&mdash;is in a little trouble on account of his wife." He
paused, because of his uncertainty as to whether he could succeed
with this now or not, seeing that Short's expression changed ever
so slightly. And yet, having gone so far, he did not know how to
recede. So now he laughed nervously and then added: "I don't know
why they always come to me with their troubles, but I guess they
think I ought to know all about these things." (He laughed again.)
"Only I'm about as new and green here as anybody and so I'm kinda
stumped. But you've been here longer than I have, I guess, and so I
thought I might ask you."</p>

<p>His manner as he said this was as nonchalant as he could make
it, the while he decided now that this was a mistake&mdash;that
Short would most certainly think him a fool or queer. Yet Short,
taken back by the nature of the query, which he sensed as odd
coming from Clyde to him (he had noted Clyde's sudden restraint and
slight nervousness), was still so pleased to think that even in
connection with so ticklish a thing as this, he should be made the
recipient of his confidence, that he instantly recovered his former
poise and affability, and replied: "Why, sure, if it's anything I
can help you with, Mr. Griffiths, I'll be only too glad to. Go
ahead, what is it?"</p>

<p>"Well, it's this way," began Clyde, not a little revived by the
other's hearty response, yet lowering his voice in order to give
the dreadful subject its proper medium of obscurity, as it were.
"His wife's already two months gone and he can't afford a kid yet
and he doesn't know how to get rid of it. I told him last month
when he first came to me to try a certain medicine that usually
works"&mdash;this to impress Short with his own personal wisdom and
resourcefulness in such situations and hence by implication to
clear his own skirts, as it were&mdash;"But I guess he didn't
handle it right. Anyhow he's all worked up about it now and wants
to see some doctor who could do something for her, you see. Only I
don't know anybody here myself. Haven't been here long enough. If
it were Kansas City or Chicago now," he interpolated securely, "I'd
know what to do. I know three or four doctors out there." (To
impress Short he attempted a wise smile.) "But down here it's
different. And if I started asking around in my crowd and it ever
got back to my relatives, they wouldn't understand. But I thought
if you knew of any one you wouldn't mind telling me. I wouldn't
really bother myself, only I'm sorry for this fellow."</p>

<p>He paused, his face, largely because of the helpful and
interested expression on Short's, expressing more confidence than
when he had begun. And although Short was still surprised he was
more than pleased to be as helpful as he could.</p>

<p>"You say it's been two months now."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And the stuff you suggested didn't work, eh?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"She's tried it again this month, has she?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well, that is bad, sure enough. I guess she's in bad all right.
The trouble with this place is that I haven't been here so very
long either, Mr. Griffiths. I only bought this place about a year
and a half ago. Now, if I were over in Gloversville&mdash;" He
paused for a moment, as though, like Clyde, he too were dubious of
the wisdom of entering upon details of this kind, but after a few
seconds continued: "You see a thing like that's not so easy,
wherever you are. Doctors are always afraid of getting in trouble.
I did hear once of a case over there, though, where a girl went to
a doctor&mdash;a fellow who lived a couple miles out. But she was
of pretty good family too, and the fellow who took her to him was
pretty well-known about there. So I don't know whether this doctor
would do anything for a stranger, although he might at that. But I
know that sort of thing is going on all the time, so you might try.
If you wanta send this fellow to him, tell him not to mention me or
let on who sent him, 'cause I'm pretty well-known around there and
I wouldn't want to be mixed up in it in case anything went wrong,
you see. You know how it is."</p>

<p>And Clyde, in turn, replied gratefully: "Oh, sure, he'll
understand all right. I'll tell him not to mention any names." And
getting the doctor's name, he extracted a pencil and notebook from
his pocket in order to be sure that the important information
should not escape him.</p>

<p>Short, sensing his relief, was inclined to wonder whether there
was a working-man, or whether it was not Clyde himself who was in
this scrape. Why should he be speaking for a young working-man at
the factory? Just the same, he was glad to be of service, though at
the same time he was thinking what a bit of local news this would
be, assuming that any time in the future he should choose to retail
it. Also that Clyde, unless he was truly playing about with some
girl here who was in trouble, was foolish to be helping anybody
else in this way&mdash;particularly a working-man. You bet he
wouldn't.</p>

<p>Nevertheless he repeated the name, with the initials, and the
exact neighborhood, as near as he could remember, giving the car
stop and a description of the house. Clyde, having obtained what he
desired, now thanked him, and then went out while the haberdasher
looked after him genially and a little suspiciously. These rich
young bloods, he thought. That's a funny request for a fellow like
that to make of me. You'd think with all the people he knows and
runs with here he'd know some one who would tip him off quicker
than I could. Still, maybe, it's just because of them that he is
afraid to ask around here. You don't know who he might have got in
trouble&mdash;that young Finchley girl herself, even. You never can
tell. I see him around with her occasionally, and she's gay enough.
But, gee, wouldn't that be the...</p>

<h3>Chapter 37</h3>

<p>The information thus gained was a relief, but only partially so.
For both Clyde and Roberta there was no real relief now until this
problem should be definitely solved. And although within a few
moments after he had obtained it, he appeared and explained that at
last he had secured the name of some one who might help her, still
there was yet the serious business of heartening her for the task
of seeing the doctor alone, also for the story that was to
exculpate him and at the same time win for her sufficient sympathy
to cause the doctor to make the charge for his service merely
nominal.</p>

<p>But now, instead of protesting as at first he feared that she
might, Roberta was moved to acquiesce. So many things in Clyde's
attitude since Christmas had so shocked her that she was bewildered
and without a plan other than to extricate herself as best she
might without any scandal attaching to her or him and then going
her own way&mdash;pathetic and abrasive though it might be. For
since he did not appear to care for her any more and plainly
desired to be rid of her, she was in no mood to compel him to do
other than he wished. Let him go. She could make her own way. She
had, and she could too, without him, if only she could get out of
this. Yet, as she said this to herself, however, and a sense of the
full significance of it all came to her, the happy days that would
never be again, she put her hands to her eyes and brushed away
uncontrollable tears. To think that all that was should come to
this.</p>

<p>Yet when he called the same evening after visiting Short, his
manner redolent of a fairly worth-while achievement, she merely
said, after listening to his explanation in as receptive a manner
as she could: "Do you know just where this is, Clyde? Can we get
there on the car without much trouble, or will we have to walk a
long way?" And after he had explained that it was but a little way
out of Gloversville, in the suburbs really, an interurban stop
being but a quarter of a mile from the house, she had added: "Is he
home at night, or will we have to go in the daytime? It would be so
much better if we could go at night. There'd be so much less danger
of any one seeing us." And being assured that he was, as Clyde had
learned from Short, she went on: "But do you know is he old or
young? I'd feel so much easier and safer if he were old. I don't
like young doctors. We've always had an old doctor up home and I
feel so much easier talking to some one like him."</p>

<p>Clyde did not know. He had not thought to inquire, but to
reassure her he ventured that he was middle-aged&mdash;which
chanced to be the fact.</p>

<p>The following evening the two of them departed, but separately
as usual, for Fonda, where it was necessary to change cars. And
once within the approximate precincts of the physician's residence,
they stepped down and made their way along a road, which in this
mid-state winter weather was still covered with old and dry-packed
snow. It offered a comparatively smooth floor for their quick
steps. For in these days, there was no longer that lingering
intimacy which formerly would have characterized both. In those
other and so recent days, as Roberta was constantly thinking, he
would have been only too glad in such a place as this, if not on
such an occasion, to drag his steps, put an arm about her waist,
and talk about nothing at all&mdash;the night, the work at the
factory, Mr. Liggett, his uncle, the current movies, some place
they were planning to go, something they would love to do together
if they could. But now...And on this particular occasion, when most
of all, and if ever, she needed the full strength of his devotion
and support! Yet now, as she could see, he was most nervously
concerned as to whether, going alone in this way, she was going to
get scared and "back out"; whether she was going to think to say
the right thing at the right time and convince the doctor that he
must do something for her, and for a nominal fee.</p>

<p>"Well, Bert, how about you? All right? You're not going to get
cold feet now, are you? Gee, I hope not because this is going to be
a good chance to get this thing done and over with. And it isn't
like you were going to some one who hadn't done anything like this
before, you know, because this fellow has. I got that straight. All
you have to do now, is to say, well, you know, that you're in
trouble, see, and that you don't know how you're going to get out
of it unless he'll help you in some way, because you haven't any
friends here you can go to. And besides, as things are, you
couldn't go to 'em if you wanted to. They'd tell on you, see. Then
if he asks where I am or who I am, you just say that I was a fellow
here&mdash;but that I've gone&mdash;give any name you want to, but
that I've gone, and you don't know where I've gone to&mdash;run
away, see. Then you'd better say, too, that you wouldn't have come
to him only that you heard of another case in which he helped some
one else&mdash;that a girl told you, see. Only you don't want to
let on that you're paid much, I mean,&mdash;because if you do he
may want to make the bill more than I can pay, see, unless he'll
give us a few months in which to do it, or something like that, you
see."</p>

<p>Clyde was so nervous and so full of the necessity of charging
Roberta with sufficient energy and courage to go through with this
and succeed, now that he had brought her this far along with it,
that he scarcely realized how inadequate and trivial, even, in so
far as her predicament and the doctor's mood and temperament were
concerned, his various instructions and bits of inexperienced
advice were. And she on her part was not only thinking how easy it
was for him to stand back and make suggestions, while she was
confronted with the necessity of going forward, and that alone, but
also that he was really thinking more of himself than he was of
her&mdash;some way to make her get herself out of it inexpensively
and without any real trouble to him.</p>

<p>At the same time, even here and now, in spite of all this, she
was still decidedly drawn to him&mdash;his white face, his thin
hands, nervous manner. And although she knew he talked to encourage
her to do what he had not the courage or skill to do himself, she
was not angry. Rather, she was merely saying to herself in this
crisis that although he advised so freely she was not going to pay
attention to him&mdash;much. What she was going to say was not that
she was deserted, for that seemed too much of a disagreeable and
self-incriminating remark for her to make concerning herself, but
rather that she was married and that she and her young husband were
too poor to have a baby as yet&mdash;the same story Clyde had told
the druggist in Schenectady, as she recalled. For after all, what
did he know about how she felt? And he was not going with her to
make it easier for her.</p>

<p>Yet dominated by the purely feminine instinct to cling to some
one for support, she now turned to Clyde, taking hold of his hands
and standing quite still, wishing that he would hold and pet her
and tell her that it was all right and that she must not be afraid.
And although he no longer cared for her, now in the face of this
involuntary evidence of her former trust in him, he released both
hands and putting his arms about her, the more to encourage her
than anything else, observed: "Come on now, Bert. Gee, you can't
act like this, you know. You don't want to lose your nerve now that
we're here, do you? It won't be so hard once you get there. I know
it won't. All you got to do is to go up and ring the bell, see, and
when he comes, or whoever comes, just say you want to see the
doctor alone, see. Then he'll understand it's something private and
it'll be easier."</p>

<p>He went on with more advice of the same kind, and she, realizing
from his lack of spontaneous enthusiasm for her at this moment how
desperate was her state, drew herself together as vigorously as she
could, and saying: "Well, wait here, then, will you? Don't go very
far away, will you? I may be right back," hurried along in the
shadow through the gate and up a walk which led to the front
door.</p>

<p>In answer to her ring the door was opened by one of those
exteriorly as well as mentally sober, small-town practitioners who,
Clyde's and Short's notion to the contrary notwithstanding, was the
typical and fairly conservative physician of the countryside&mdash;
solemn, cautious, moral, semi-religious to a degree, holding some
views which he considered liberal and others which a fairly liberal
person would have considered narrow and stubborn into the bargain.
Yet because of the ignorance and stupidity of so many of those
about him, he was able to consider himself at least fairly learned.
In constant touch with all phases of ignorance and dereliction as
well as sobriety, energy, conservatism, success and the like, he
was more inclined, where fact appeared to nullify his early
conclusion in regard to many things, to suspend judgment between
the alleged claims of heaven and hell and leave it there suspended
and undisturbed. Physically he was short, stocky, bullet-headed and
yet interestingly-featured, with quick gray eyes and a pleasant
mouth and smile. His short iron-gray hair was worn "bangs" fashion,
a bit of rural vanity. And his arms and hands, the latter fat and
pudgy, yet sensitive, hung limply at his sides. He was fifty-eight,
married, the father of three children, one of them a son already
studying medicine in order to succeed to his father's practice.</p>

<p>After showing Roberta into a littered and commonplace waiting
room and asking her to remain until he had finished his dinner, he
presently appeared in the door of an equally commonplace inner
room, or office, where were his desk, two chairs, some medical
instruments, books and apparently an ante-chamber containing other
medical things, and motioned her to a chair. And because of his
grayness, solidity, stolidity, as well as an odd habit he had of
blinking his eyes, Roberta was not a little overawed, though by no
means so unfavorably impressed as she had feared she might be. At
least he was old and he seemed intelligent and conservative, if not
exactly sympathetic or warm in his manner. And after looking at her
curiously a moment, as though seeking to recognize some one of the
immediate vicinity, he began: "Well, now who is this, please? And
what can I do for you?" His voice was low and quite
reassuring&mdash;a fact for which Roberta was deeply grateful.</p>

<p>At the same time, startled by the fact that at last she had
reached the place and the moment when, if ever, she must say the
degrading truth about herself, she merely sat there, her eyes first
upon him, then upon the floor, her fingers beginning to toy with
the handle of the small bag she carried.</p>

<p>"You see, well," she began, earnestly and nervously, her whole
manner suddenly betraying the terrific strain under which she was
laboring. "I came...I came...that is...I don't know whether I can
tell you about myself or not. I thought I could just before I came
in, but now that I am here and I see you..." She paused and moved
back in her chair as though to rise, at the same time that she
added: "Oh, dear, how very dreadful it all is. I'm so nervous
and..."</p>

<p>"Well, now, my dear," he resumed, pleasantly and reassuringly,
impressed by her attractive and yet sober appearance and wondering
for the moment what could have upset so clean, modest and
sedate-looking a girl, and hence not a little amused by her "now
that I see you,"&mdash;"Just what is there about me 'now that you
see me,'" he repeated after her, "that so frightens you? I am only
a country doctor, you know, and I hope I'm not as dreadful as you
seem to think. You can be sure that you can tell me anything you
wish&mdash; anything at all about yourself&mdash;and you needn't be
afraid. If there's anything I can do for you, I'll do it."</p>

<p>He was decidedly pleasant, as she now thought, and yet so sober
and reserved and probably conventional withal that what she was
holding in mind to tell him would probably shock him not a
little&mdash;and then what? Would he do anything for her? And if he
would, how was she to arrange about money, for that certainly would
be a point in connection with all this? If only Clyde or some one
were here to speak for her. And yet she must speak now that she was
here. She could not leave without. Once more she moved and twisted,
seizing nervously on a large button of her coat to turn between her
thumb and forefinger, and then went on chokingly.</p>

<p>"But this is...this is...well, something different, you know,
maybe not what you think...I...I...well..."</p>

<p>Again she paused, unable to proceed, shading from white to red
and back as she spoke. And because of the troubled modesty of her
approach, as well as a certain clarity of eye, whiteness of
forehead, sobriety of manner and dress, the doctor could scarcely
bring himself to think for a moment that this was anything other
than one of those morbid exhibitions of innocence, or rather
inexperience, in connection with everything relating to the human
body&mdash;so characteristic of the young and unsophisticated in
some instances. And so he was about to repeat his customary formula
in such cases that all could be told to him without fear or
hesitation, whatever it might be, when a secondary thought, based
on Roberta's charm and vigor, as well as her own thought waves
attacking his cerebral receptive centers, caused him to decide that
he might be wrong. After all, why might not this be another of
those troublesome youthful cases in which possibly immorality and
illegitimacy was involved. She was so young, healthy and
attractive, besides, they were always cropping up, these
cases,&mdash;in connection with the most respectable-looking girls
at times. And invariably they spelled trouble and distress for
doctors. And, for various reasons connected with his own
temperament, which was retiring and recessive, as well as the
nature of this local social world, he disliked and hesitated to
even trifle with them. They were illegal, dangerous, involved
little or no pay as a rule, and the sentiment of this local world
was all against them as he knew. Besides he personally was more or
less irritated by these young scamps of boys and girls who were so
free to exercise the normal functions of their natures in the first
instance, but so ready to refuse the social obligations which went
with them&mdash;marriage afterwards. And so, although in several
cases in the past ten years where family and other neighborhood and
religious considerations had made it seem quite advisable, he had
assisted in extricating from the consequences of their folly
several young girls of good family who had fallen from grace and
could not otherwise be rescued, still he was opposed to aiding,
either by his own countenance or skill, any lapses or tangles not
heavily sponsored by others. It was too dangerous. Ordinarily it
was his custom to advise immediate and unconditional marriage. Or,
where that was not possible, the perpetrator of the infamy having
decamped, it was his general and self-consciously sanctioned
practice to have nothing at all to do with the matter. It was too
dangerous and ethically and socially wrong and criminal into the
bargain.</p>

<p>In consequence he now looked at Roberta in an extremely sober
manner. By no means, he now said to himself, must he allow himself
to become emotionally or otherwise involved here. And so in order
to help himself as well as her to attain and maintain a balance
which would permit of both extricating themselves without too much
trouble, he drew toward him his black leather case record book and,
opening it, said: "Now, let's see if we can't find out what the
trouble is here. What is your name?"</p>

<p>"Ruth Howard. Mrs. Howard," replied Roberta nervously and
tensely, at once fixing upon a name which Clyde had suggested for
her use. And now, interestingly enough, at mention of the fact that
she was married, he breathed easier. But why the tears then? What
reason could a young married woman have for being so intensely shy
and nervous?</p>

<p>"And your husband's first name?" he went on.</p>

<p>As simple as the question was, and as easy as it should have
been to answer, Roberta nevertheless hesitated before she could
bring herself to say: "Gifford," her older brother's name.</p>

<p>"You live around her, I presume?"</p>

<p>"In Fonda."</p>

<p>"Yes. And how old are you?"</p>

<p>"Twenty-two."</p>

<p>"How long have you been married?"</p>

<p>This inquiry being so intimately connected with the problem
before her, she again hesitated before saying, "Let me
see&mdash;three months."</p>

<p>At once Dr. Glenn became dubious again, though he gave her no
sign. Her hesitancy arrested him. Why the uncertainty? He was
wondering now again whether he was dealing with a truthful girl or
whether his first suspicions were being substantiated. In
consequence he now asked: "Well, now what seems to be the trouble,
Mrs. Howard? You need have no hesitancy in telling me&mdash;none
whatsoever. I am used to such things year in and out, whatever they
are. That is my business, listening to the troubles of people."</p>

<p>"Well," began Roberta, nervously once more, this terrible
confession drying her throat and thickening her tongue almost,
while once more she turned the same button of her coat and gazed at
the floor. "It's like this...You see...my husband hasn't much
money...and I have to work to help out with expenses and neither of
us make so very much." (She was astonishing herself with her own
shameful power to lie in this instance&mdash;she, who had always
hated to lie.) "So...of course...we can't afford to...to
have...well, any...children, you see, so soon, anyhow, and..."</p>

<p>She paused, her breath catching, and really unable to proceed
further with this wholesale lying.</p>

<p>The doctor realizing from this, as he thought, what the true
problem was&mdash;that she was a newly-married girl who was
probably faced by just such a problem as she was attempting to
outline&mdash;yet not wishing to enter upon any form of malpractice
and at the same time not wishing to appear too discouraging to a
young couple just starting out in life, gazed at her somewhat more
sympathetically, the decidedly unfortunate predicament of these
young people, as well as her appropriate modesty in the face of
such a conventionally delicate situation, appealing to him. It was
too bad. Young people these days did have a rather hard time of it,
getting started in some cases, anyhow. And they were no doubt faced
by some pressing financial situations. Nearly all young people
were. Nevertheless, this business of a contraceptal operation or
interference with the normal or God-arranged life processes, well,
that was a ticklish and unnatural business at best which he wanted
as little as possible to do with. Besides, young, healthy people,
even though poor, when they undertook marriage, knew what they were
about. And it was not impossible for them to work, the husband
anyhow, and hence manage in some way.</p>

<p>And now straightening himself around in his chair very soberly
and authoritatively, he began: "I think I understand what you want
to say to me, Mrs. Howard. But I'm also wondering if you have
considered what a very serious and dangerous thing it is you have
in mind. But," he added, suddenly, another thought as to whether
his own reputation in this community was in any way being tarnished
by rumor of anything he had done in the past coming to him, "just
how did you happen to come to me, anyhow?"</p>

<p>Something about the tone of his voice, the manner in which he
asked the question&mdash;the caution of it as well as the possibly
impending resentment in case it should turn out that any one
suspected him of a practice of this sort&mdash;caused Roberta to
hesitate and to feel that any statement to the effect that she had
heard of or been sent by any one else&mdash;Clyde to the contrary
notwithstanding&mdash;might be dangerous. Perhaps she had better
not say that she had been sent by any one. He might resent it as an
insult to his character as a reputable physician. A budding
instinct for diplomacy helped her in this instance, and she
replied: "I've noticed your sign in passing several times and I've
heard different people say you were a good doctor."</p>

<p>His uncertainty allayed, he now continued: "In the first place,
the thing you want done is something my conscience would not permit
me to advise. I understand, of course, that you consider it
necessary. You and your husband are both young and you probably
haven't very much money to go on, and you both feel that an
interruption of this kind will be a great strain in every way. And
no doubt it will be. Still, as I see it, marriage is a very sacred
thing, and children are a blessing&mdash;not a curse. And when you
went to the altar three months ago you were probably not unaware
that you might have to face just such a situation as this. All
young married people are, I think." ("The altar," thought Roberta
sadly. If only it were so.) "Now I know that the tendency of the
day in some quarters is very much in this direction, I am sorry to
say. There are those who feel it quite all right if they can shirk
the normal responsibilities in such cases as to perform these
operations, but it's very dangerous, Mrs. Howard, very dangerous
legally and ethically as well as medically very wrong. Many women
who seek to escape childbirth die in this way. Besides it is a
prison offense for any doctor to assist them, whether there are bad
consequences or not. You know that, I suppose. At any rate, I, for
one, am heartily opposed to this sort of thing from every point of
view. The only excuse I have ever been able to see for it is when
the life of the mother, for instance, depends upon such an
operation. Not otherwise. And in such cases the medical profession
is in accord. But in this instance I'm sure the situation isn't one
which warrants anything like that. You seem to me to be a strong,
healthy girl. Motherhood should hold no serious consequences for
you. And as for money reasons, don't you really think now that if
you just go ahead and have this baby, you and your husband would
find means of getting along? You say your husband is an
electrician?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Roberta, nervously, not a little overawed and
subdued by his solemn moralizing.</p>

<p>"Well, now, there you are," he went on. "That's not such an
unprofitable profession. At least all electricians charge enough.
And when you consider, as you must, how serious a thing you are
thinking of doing, that you are actually planning to destroy a
young life that has as good a right to its existence as you have to
yours..." he paused in order to let the substance of what he was
saying sink in&mdash;"well, then, I think you might feel called
upon to stop and consider&mdash;both you and your husband.
Besides," he added, in a diplomatic and more fatherly and even
intriguing tone of voice, "I think that once you have it it will
more than make up to you both for whatever little hardship its
coming will bring you. Tell me," he added curiously at this point,
"does your husband know of this? Or is this just some plan of yours
to save him and yourself from too much hardship?" He almost beamed
cheerfully as, fancying he had captured Roberta in some purely
nervous and feminine economy as well as dread, he decided that if
so he could easily extract her from her present mood. And she,
sensing his present drift and feeling that one lie more or less
could neither help nor harm her, replied quickly: "He knows."</p>

<p>"Well, then," he went on, slightly reduced by the fact that his
surmise was incorrect, but none the less resolved to dissuade her
and him, too: "I think you two should really consider very
seriously before you go further in this matter. I know when young
people first face a situation like this they always look on the
darkest side of it, but it doesn't always work out that way. I know
my wife and I did with our first child. But we got along. And if
you will only stop now and talk it over, you'll see it in a
different light, I'm sure. And then you won't have your conscience
to deal with afterwards, either." He ceased, feeling reasonably
sure that he had dispelled the fear, as well as the determination
that had brought Roberta to him&mdash;that, being a sensible,
ordinary wife, she would now desist of course&mdash;think nothing
more of her plan and leave.</p>

<p>But instead of either acquiescing cheerfully or rising to go, as
he thought she might, she gave him a wide-eyed terrified look and
then as instantly burst into tears. For the total effect of his
address had been to first revive more clearly than ever the normal
social or conventional aspect of the situation which all along she
was attempting to shut out from her thoughts and which, under
ordinary circumstances, assuming that she was really married, was
exactly the attitude she would have taken. But now the realization
that her problem was not to be solved at all, by this man at least,
caused her to be seized with what might best be described as morbid
panic.</p>

<p>Suddenly beginning to open and shut her fingers and at the same
time beating her knees, while her face contorted itself with pain
and terror, she exclaimed: "But you don't understand, doctor, you
don't understand! I <i>have</i> to get out of this in some way! I
have to. It isn't like I told you at all. I'm not married. I
haven't any husband at all. But, oh, you don't know what this means
to me. My family! My father! My mother! I can't tell you. But I
must get out of it. I must! I must! Oh, you don't know, you don't
know! I must! I must!" She began to rock backward and forward, at
the same time swaying from side to side as in a trance.</p>

<p>And Glenn, surprised and startled by this sudden demonstration
as well as emotionally affected, and yet at the same time advised
thereby that his original surmise had been correct, and hence that
Roberta had been lying, as well as that if he wished to keep
himself out of this he must now assume a firm and even heartless
attitude, asked solemnly: "You are not married, you say?"</p>

<p>For answer now Roberta merely shook her head negatively and
continued to cry. And at last gathering the full import of her
situation, Dr. Glenn got up, his face a study of troubled and yet
conservative caution and sympathy. But without saying anything at
first he merely looked at her as she wept. Later he added: "Well,
well, this is too bad. I'm sorry." But fearing to commit himself in
any way, he merely paused, adding after a time soothingly and
dubiously: "You mustn't cry. That won't help you any." He then
paused again, still determined not to have anything to do with this
case. Yet a bit curious as to the true nature of the story he
finally asked: "Well, then where is the young man who is the cause
of your trouble? Is he here?"</p>

<p>Still too overcome by shame and despair to speak, Roberta merely
shook her head negatively.</p>

<p>"But he knows that you're in trouble, doesn't he?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Roberta faintly.</p>

<p>"And he won't marry you?"</p>

<p>"He's gone away."</p>

<p>"Oh, I see. The young scamp! And don't you know where he's
gone?"</p>

<p>"No," lied Roberta, weakly.</p>

<p>"How long has it been since he left you?"</p>

<p>"About a week now." Once more she lied.</p>

<p>"And you don't know where he is?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"How long has it been since you were sick?"</p>

<p>"Over two weeks now," sobbed Roberta.</p>

<p>"And before that you have always been regular?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well, in the first place," his tone was more comfortable and
pleasant than before&mdash;he seemed to be snatching at a plausible
excuse for extricating himself from a case which promised little
other than danger and difficulty, "this may not be as serious as
you think. I know you're probably very much frightened, but it's
not unusual for women to miss a period. At any rate, without an
examination it wouldn't be possible to be sure, and even if you
were, the most advisable thing would be to wait another two weeks.
You may find then that there is nothing wrong. I wouldn't be
surprised if you did. You seem to be oversensitive and nervous and
that sometimes brings about delays of this kind&mdash;mere
nervousness. At any rate, if you'll take my advice, whatever you
do, you'll not do anything now but just go home and wait until
you're really sure. For even if anything were to be done, it
wouldn't be advisable for you to do anything before then."</p>

<p>"But I've already taken some pills and they haven't helped me,"
pleaded Roberta.</p>

<p>"What were they?" asked Glenn interestedly, and, after he had
learned, merely commented: "Oh, those. Well, they wouldn't be
likely to be of any real service to you, if you were pregnant. But
I still suggest that you wait, and if you find you pass your second
period, then it will be time enough to act, although I earnestly
advise you, even then, to do nothing if you can help it, because I
consider it wrong to interfere with nature in this way. It would be
much better, if you would arrange to have the child and take care
of it. Then you wouldn't have the additional sin of destroying a
life upon your conscience."</p>

<p>He was very grave and felt very righteous as he said this. But
Roberta, faced by terrors which he did not appear to be able to
grasp, merely exclaimed, and as dramatically as before: "But I
can't do that, doctor, I tell you! I can't. I can't! You don't
understand. Oh, I don't know what I shall do unless I find some way
out of this. I don't! I don't! I don't!"</p>

<p>She shook her head and clenched her fingers and rocked to and
fro while Glenn, impressed by her own terrors, the pity of the
folly which, as he saw it, had led her to this dreadful pass, yet
professionally alienated by a type of case that spelled nothing but
difficulty for him stood determinedly before her and added: "As I
told you before, Miss&mdash;" (he paused) "Howard, if that is your
name, I am seriously opposed to operations of this kind, just as I
am to the folly that brings girls and young men to the point where
they seem to think they are necessary. A physician may not
interfere in a case of this kind unless he is willing to spend ten
years in prison, and I think that law is fair enough. Not that I
don't realize how painful your present situation appears to you.
But there are always those who are willing to help a girl in your
state, providing she doesn't wish to do something which is morally
and legally wrong. And so the very best advice I can give you now
is that you do nothing at all now or at any time. Better go home
and see your parents and confess. It will be much better&mdash;much
better, I assure you. Not nearly as hard as you think or as wicked
as this other way. Don't forget there is a life there&mdash;a
human&mdash;if it is really as you think. A human life which you
are seeking to end and that I cannot help you to do. I really
cannot. There may be doctors&mdash;I know there are&mdash;men here
and there who take their professional ethics a little less
seriously than I do; but I cannot let myself become one of them. I
am sorry&mdash;very.</p>

<p>"So now the best I can say is&mdash;go home to your parents and
tell them. It may look hard now but you are going to feel better
about it in the long run. If it will make you or them feel any
better about it, let them come and talk to me. I will try and make
them see that this is not the worst thing in the world, either. But
as for doing what you want&mdash;I am very, very sorry, but I
cannot. My conscience will not permit me."</p>

<p>He paused and gazed at her sympathetically, yet with a
determined and concluded look in his eye. And Roberta, dumbfounded
by this sudden termination of all her hopes in connection with him
and realizing at last that not only had she been misled by Clyde's
information in regard to this doctor, but that her technical as
well as emotional plea had failed, now walked unsteadily to the
door, the terrors of the future crowding thick upon her. And once
outside in the dark, after the doctor had most courteously and
ruefully closed the door behind her, she paused to lean against a
tree that was there&mdash;her nervous and physical strength all but
failing her. He had refused to help her. He had refused to help
her. And now what?</p>

<h3>Chapter 38</h3>

<p>The first effect of the doctor's decision was to shock and
terrify them both&mdash;Roberta and Clyde&mdash;beyond measure. For
apparently now here was illegitimacy and disgrace for Roberta.
Exposure and destruction for Clyde. And this had been their one
solution seemingly. Then, by degrees, for Clyde at least, there was
a slight lifting of the heavy pall. Perhaps, after all, as the
doctor had suggested&mdash;and once she had recovered her senses
sufficiently to talk, she had told him&mdash;the end had not been
reached. There was the bare possibility, as suggested by the
druggist, Short and the doctor, that she might be mistaken. And
this, while not producing a happy reaction in her, had the
unsatisfactory result of inducing in Clyde a lethargy based more
than anything else on the ever-haunting fear of inability to cope
with this situation as well as the certainty of social exposure in
case he did not which caused him, instead of struggling all the
more desperately, to defer further immediate action. For, such was
his nature that, although he realized clearly the probably tragic
consequences if he did not act, still it was so hard to think to
whom else to apply to without danger to himself. To think that the
doctor had "turned her down," as he phrased it, and that Short's
advice should have been worth as little as that!</p>

<p>But apart from nervous thoughts as to whom to turn to next, no
particular individual occurred to him before the two weeks were
gone, or after. It was so hard to just ask anywhere. One just
couldn't do it. Besides, of whom could he ask now? Of whom? These
things took time, didn't they? Yet in the meantime, the days going
by, both he and Roberta had ample time to consider what, if any,
steps they must take&mdash;the one in regard to the other&mdash;in
case no medical or surgical solution was found. For Roberta, while
urging and urging, if not so much by words as by expression and
mood at her work, was determined that she must not be left to fight
this out alone&mdash;she could not be. On the other hand, as she
could see, Clyde did nothing. For apart from what he had already
attempted to do, he was absolutely at a loss how to proceed. He had
no intimates and in consequence he could only think of presenting
the problem as an imaginary one to one individual and another here
or there in the hope of extracting some helpful information. At the
same time, and as impractical and evasive as it may seem, there was
the call of that diverting world of which Sondra was a part,
evenings and Sundays, when, in spite of Roberta's wretched state
and mood, he was called to go here and there, and did, because in
so doing he was actually relieving his own mind of the dread
specter of disaster that was almost constantly before it. If only
he could get her out of this! If only he could. But how, without
money, intimates, a more familiar understanding of the medical or
if not that exactly, then the sub rosa world of sexual free-masonry
which some at times&mdash;the bell-hops of the Green-Davidson, for
instance, seemed to understand. He had written to Ratterer, of
course, but there had been no answer, since Ratterer had removed to
Florida and as yet Clyde's letter had not reached him. And locally
all those he knew best were either connected with the factory or
society&mdash;individuals on the one hand too inexperienced or
dangerous, or on the other hand, too remote and dangerous, since he
was not sufficiently intimate with any of them as yet to command
their true confidence and secrecy.</p>

<p>At the same time he must do something&mdash;he could not just
rest and drift. Assuredly Roberta could not long permit him to do
that&mdash; faced as she was by exposure. And so from time to time
he actually racked himself&mdash;seized upon straws and what would
have been looked upon by most as forlorn chances. Thus, for
instance, an associate foreman, chancing to reminisce one day
concerning a certain girl in his department who had "gotten in
trouble" and had been compelled to leave, he had been given the
opportunity to inquire what he thought such a girl did in case she
could not afford or did not want to have a child. But this
particular foreman, being as uninformed as himself, merely observed
that she probably had to see a doctor if she knew one or "go
through with it"&mdash;which left Clyde exactly where he was. On
another occasion, in connection with a conversation in a barber
shop, relating to a local case reported in The Star where a girl
was suing a local ne'er-do-well for breach of promise, the remark
was made that she would "never have sued that guy, you bet, unless
she had to." Whereupon Clyde seized the opportunity to remark
hopefully, "But wouldn't you think that she could find some way of
getting out of trouble without marrying a fellow she didn't
like?"</p>

<p>"Well, that's not so easy as you may think, particularly around
here," elucidated the wiseacre who was trimming his hair. "In the
first place it's agin' the law. And next it takes a lotta money.
An' in case you ain't got it, well, money makes the mare go, you
know." He snip-snipped with his scissors while Clyde, confronted by
his own problem, meditated on how true it was. If he had a lot of
money&mdash;even a few hundred dollars&mdash;he might take it now
and possibly persuade her&mdash;who could tell&mdash;to go
somewhere by herself and have an operation performed.</p>

<p>Yet each day, as on the one before, he was saying to himself
that he must find some one. And Roberta was saying to herself that
she too must act&mdash;must not really depend on Clyde any longer
if he were going to act so. One could not trifle or compromise with
a terror of this kind. It was a cruel imposition on her. It must be
that Clyde did not realize how terribly this affected her and even
him. For certainly, if he were not going to help her out of it, as
he had distinctly said he would do at first, then decidedly she
could not be expected to weather the subsequent storm alone. Never,
never, never! For, after all, as Roberta saw it, Clyde was a
man&mdash; he had a good position&mdash;it was not he, but she, who
was in this treacherous position and unable to extricate herself
alone.</p>

<p>And beginning with the second day after the second period, when
she discovered for once and all that her worst suspicions were
true, she not only emphasized the fact in every way that she could
that she was distressed beyond all words, but on the third day
announced to him in a note that she was again going to see the
doctor near Gloversville that evening, regardless of his previous
refusal&mdash;so great was her need&mdash;and also asking Clyde
whether he would accompany her&mdash;a request which, since he had
not succeeded in doing anything, and although he had an engagement
with Sondra, he instantly acceded to&mdash;feeling it to be of
greater importance than anything else. He must excuse himself to
Sondra on the ground of work.</p>

<p>And accordingly this second trip was made, a long and nervous
conversation between himself and Roberta on the way resulting in
nothing more than some explanations as to why thus far he had not
been able to achieve anything, plus certain encomiums addressed to
her concerning her courage in acting for herself in this way.</p>

<p>Yet the doctor again would not and did not act. After waiting
nearly an hour for his return from somewhere, she was merely
permitted to tell him of her unchanged state and her destroying
fears in regard to herself, but with no hint from him that he could
be induced to act as indeed he could act. It was against his
prejudices and ethics.</p>

<p>And so once more Roberta returned, this time not crying,
actually too sad to cry, choked with the weight of her impending
danger and the anticipatory fears and miseries that attended
it.</p>

<p>And Clyde, hearing of this defeat, was at last reduced to a
nervous, gloomy silence, absolutely devoid of a helpful suggestion.
He could not think what to say and was chiefly fearful lest Roberta
now make some demand with which socially or economically he could
not comply. However, in regard to this she said little on the way
home. Instead she sat and stared out of the window&mdash;thinking
of her defenseless predicament that was becoming more real and
terrible to her hourly. By way of excuse she pleaded that she had a
headache. She wanted to be alone&mdash;only to think more&mdash;to
try to work out a solution. She must work out some way. That she
knew. But what? How? What could she do? How could she possibly
escape? She felt like a cornered animal fighting for its life with
all odds against it, and she thought of a thousand remote and
entirely impossible avenues of escape, only to return to the one
and only safe and sound solution that she really felt should be
possible&mdash; and that was marriage. And why not? Hadn't she
given him all, and that against her better judgment? Hadn't he
overpersuaded her? Who was he anyway to so cast her aside? For
decidedly at times, and especially since this latest crisis had
developed, his manner, because of Sondra and the Griffiths and what
he felt to be the fatal effect of all this on his dreams here, was
sufficient to make plain that love was decidedly dead, and that he
was not thinking nearly so much of the meaning of her state to her,
as he was of its import to him, the injury that was most certain to
accrue to him. And when this did not completely terrify her, as
mostly it did, it served to irritate and slowly develop the
conclusion that in such a desperate state as this, she was
justified in asking more than ordinarily she would have dreamed of
asking, marriage itself, since there was no other door. And why
not? Wasn't her life as good as his? And hadn't he joined his to
hers, voluntarily? Then, why shouldn't he strive to help her
now&mdash;or, failing that, make this final sacrifice which was the
only one by which she could be rescued apparently. For who were all
the society people with whom he was concerned anyhow? And why
should he ask her in such a crisis to sacrifice herself, her future
and good name, just because of his interest in them? They had never
done anything very much for him, certainly not as much as had she.
And, just because he was wearying now, after persuading her to do
his bidding&mdash;was that any reason why now, in this crisis, he
should be permitted to desert her? After all, wouldn't all of these
society people in whom he was so much interested feel that whatever
his relationship to them, she would be justified in taking the
course which she might be compelled to take?</p>

<p>She brooded on this much, more especially on the return from
this second attempt to induce Dr. Glenn to help her. In fact, at
moments, her face took on a defiant, determined look which was
seemingly new to her, but which only developed suddenly under such
pressure. Her jaw became a trifle set. She had made a decision. He
would have to marry her. She must make him if there were no other
way out of this. She must&mdash;she must. Think of her home, her
mother, Grace Marr, the Newtons, all who knew her in fact&mdash;the
terror and pain and shame with which this would sear all those in
any way identified with her&mdash;her father, brothers, sisters.
Impossible! Impossible! It must not and could not be! Impossible.
It might seem a little severe to her, even now, to have to insist
on this, considering all the emphasis Clyde had hitherto laid upon
his prospects here. But how, how else was she to do?</p>

<p>Accordingly the next day, and not a little to his surprise,
since for so many hours the night before they had been together,
Clyde received another note telling him that he must come again
that night. She had something to say to him, and there was
something in the tone of the note that seemed to indicate or
suggest a kind of defiance of a refusal of any kind, hitherto
absent in any of her communications to him. And at once the thought
that this situation, unless cleared away, was certain to prove
disastrous, so weighed upon him that he could not but put the best
face possible on it and consent to go and hear what it was that she
had to offer in the way of a solution&mdash;or&mdash;on the other
hand, of what she had to complain.</p>

<p>Going to her room at a late hour, he found her in what seemed to
him a more composed frame of mind than at any time since this
difficulty had appeared, a state which surprised him a little,
since he had expected to find her in tears. But now, if anything,
she appeared more complacent, her nervous thoughts as to how to
bring about a satisfactory conclusion for herself having called
into play a native shrewdness which was now seeking to exercise
itself.</p>

<p>And so directly before announcing what was in her mind, she
began by asking: "You haven't found out about another doctor, have
you, Clyde, or thought of anything?"</p>

<p>"No, I haven't, Bert," he replied most dismally and wearisomely,
his own mental tether-length having been strained to the breaking
point. "I've been trying to, as you know, but it's so darn hard to
find any one who isn't afraid to monkey with a case like this.
Honest, to tell the truth, Bert, I'm about stumped. I don't know
what we are going to do unless you can think of something. You
haven't thought or heard of any one else you could go to, have
you?" For, during the conversation that had immediately followed
her first visit to the doctor, he had hinted to her that by
striking up a fairly intimate relationship with one of the foreign
family girls, she might by degrees extract some information there
which would be of use to both. But Roberta was not of a temperament
that permitted of any such facile friendships, and nothing had come
of it.</p>

<p>However, his stating that he was "stumped" now gave her the
opportunity she was really desiring, to present the proposition
which she felt to be unavoidable and not longer to be delayed. Yet
being fearful of how Clyde would react, she hesitated as to the
form in which she would present it, and, after shaking her head and
manifesting a nervousness which was real enough, she finally said:
"Well, I'll tell you, Clyde. I've been thinking about it and I
don't see any way out of it unless&mdash;unless you, well, marry
me. It's two months now, you know, and unless we get married right
away, everybody'll know, won't they?"</p>

<p>Her manner as she said this was a mixture of outward courage
born out of her conviction that she was in the right and an inward
uncertainty about Clyde's attitude, which was all the more fused by
a sudden look of surprise, resentment, uncertainty and fear that
now transformation-wise played over his countenance; a variation
and play which, if it indicated anything definite, indicated that
she was seeking to inflict an unwarranted injury on him. For since
he had been drawing closer and closer to Sondra, his hopes had
heightened so intensely that, hearkening to this demand on the part
of Roberta now, his brow wrinkled and his manner changed from one
of comparatively affable, if nervous, consideration to that of
mingled fear, opposition as well as determination to evade drastic
consequence. For this would spell complete ruin for him, the loss
of Sondra, his job, his social hopes and ambitions in connection
with the Griffiths&mdash;all&mdash;a thought which sickened and at
the same time caused him to hesitate about how to proceed. But he
would not! he would not! He would not do this! Never! Never!!
Never!!!</p>

<p>Yet after a moment he exclaimed equivocally: "Well, gee, that's
all right, too, Bert, for you, because that fixes everything
without any trouble at all. But what about me? You don't want to
forget that that isn't going to be easy for me, the way things are
now. You know I haven't any money. All I have is my job. And
besides, the family don't know anything about you yet&mdash;not a
thing. And if it should suddenly come out now that we've been going
together all this time, and that this has happened, and that I was
going to have to get married right away, well, gee, they'll know
I've been fooling 'em and they're sure to get sore. And then what?
They might even fire me."</p>

<p>He paused to see what effect this explanation would have, but
noting the somewhat dubious expression which of late characterized
Roberta's face whenever he began excusing himself, he added
hopefully and evasively, seeking by any trick that he could to
delay this sudden issue: "Besides, I'm not so sure that I can't
find a doctor yet, either. I haven't had much luck so far, but
that's not saying that I won't. And there's a little time yet,
isn't there? Sure there is. It's all right up to three months
anyway." (He had since had a letter from Ratterer who had commented
on this fact.) "And I did hear something the other day of a doctor
over in Albany who might do it. Anyway, I thought I'd go over and
see before I said anything about him."</p>

<p>His manner, when he said this, was so equivocal that Roberta
could tell he was merely lying to gain time. There was no doctor in
Albany. Besides it was so plain that he resented her suggestion and
was only thinking of some way of escaping it. And she knew well
enough that at no time had he said directly that he would marry
her. And while she might urge, in the last analysis she could not
force him to do anything. He might just go away alone, as he had
once said in connection with inadvertently losing his job because
of her. And how much greater might not his impulse in that
direction now be, if this world here in which he was so much
interested were taken away from him, and he were to face the
necessity of taking her and a child, too. It made her more cautious
and caused her to modify her first impulse to speak out definitely
and forcefully, however great her necessity might be. And so
disturbed was he by the panorama of the bright world of which
Sondra was the center and which was now at stake, that he could
scarcely think clearly. Should he lose all this for such a world as
he and Roberta could provide for themselves&mdash;a small
home&mdash; a baby, such a routine work-a-day life as taking care
of her and a baby on such a salary as he could earn, and from which
most likely he would never again be freed! God! A sense of nausea
seized him. He could not and would not do this. And yet, as he now
saw, all his dreams could be so easily tumbled about his ears by
her and because of one false step on his part. It made him cautious
and for the first time in his life caused tact and cunning to
visualize itself as a profound necessity.</p>

<p>And at the same time, Clyde was sensing inwardly and somewhat
shamefacedly all of this profound change in himself.</p>

<p>But Roberta was saying: "Oh, I know, Clyde, but you yourself
said just now that you were stumped, didn't you? And every day that
goes by just makes it so much the worse for me, if we're not going
to be able to get a doctor. You can't get married and have a child
born within a few months&mdash;you know that. Every one in the
world would know. Besides I have myself to consider as well as you,
you know. And the baby, too." (At the mere mention of a coming
child Clyde winced and recoiled as though he had been slapped. She
noted it.) "I just must do one of two things right away,
Clyde&mdash;get married or get out of this and you don't seem to be
able to get me out of it, do you? If you're so afraid of what your
uncle might think or do in case we get married," she added
nervously and yet suavely, "why couldn't we get married right away
and then keep it a secret for a while&mdash;as long as we could, or
as long as you thought we ought to," she added shrewdly. "Meanwhile
I could go home and tell my parents about it&mdash;that I am
married, but that it must be kept a secret for a while. Then when
the time came, when things got so bad that we couldn't stay here
any longer without telling, why we could either go away somewhere,
if we wanted to&mdash;that is, if you didn't want your uncle to
know, or we could just announce that we were married some time ago.
Lots of young couples do that nowadays. And as for getting along,"
she went on, noting a sudden dour shadow that passed over Clyde's
face like a cloud, "why we could always find something to
do&mdash;I know I could, anyhow, once the baby is born."</p>

<p>When first she began to speak, Clyde had seated himself on the
edge of the bed, listening nervously and dubiously to all she had
to offer. However, when she came to that part which related to
marriage and going away, he got up&mdash;an irresistible impulse to
move overcoming him. And when she concluded with the commonplace
suggestion of going to work as soon as the baby was born, he looked
at her with little less than panic in his eyes. To think of
marrying and being in a position where it would be necessary to do
that, when with a little luck and without interference from her, he
might marry Sondra.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, that's all right for you, Bert. That fixes everything
up for you, but how about me? Why, gee whiz, I've only got started
here now as it is, and if I have to pack up and get out, and I
would have to, if ever they found out about this, why I don't know
what I'd do. I haven't any business or trade that I could turn my
hand to. It might go hard with both of us. Besides my uncle gave me
this chance because I begged him to, and if I walked off now he
never would do anything for me."</p>

<p>In his excitement he was forgetting that at one time and another
in the past he had indicated to Roberta that the state of his own
parents was not wholly unprosperous and that if things did not go
just to his liking here, he could return west and perhaps find
something to do out there. And it was some general recollection of
this that now caused her to ask: "Couldn't we go out to Denver or
something like that? Wouldn't your father be willing to help you
get something for a time, anyhow?"</p>

<p>Her tone was very soft and pleading, an attempt to make Clyde
feel that things could not be as bad as he was imagining. But the
mere mention of his father in connection with all this&mdash;the
assumption that he, of all people, might prove an escape from
drudgery for them both, was a little too much. It showed how
dreadfully incomplete was her understanding of his true position in
this world. Worse, she was looking for help from that quarter. And,
not finding it, later might possibly reproach him for
that&mdash;who could tell&mdash;for his lies in connection with it.
It made so very clear now the necessity for frustrating, if
possible, and that at once, any tendency toward this idea of
marriage. It could not be&mdash; ever.</p>

<p>And yet how was he to oppose this idea with safety, since she
felt that she had this claim on him&mdash;how say to her openly and
coldly that he could not and would not marry her? And unless he did
so now she might think it would be fair and legitimate enough for
her to compel him to do so. She might even feel privileged to go to
his uncle&mdash;his cousin (he could see Gilbert's cold eyes) and
expose him! And then destruction! Ruin! The end of all his dreams
in connection with Sondra and everything else here. But all he
could think of saying now was: "But I can't do this, Bert, not now,
anyway," a remark which at once caused Roberta to assume that the
idea of marriage, as she had interjected it here, was not one
which, under the circumstances, he had the courage to
oppose&mdash;his saying, "not now, anyway." Yet even as she was
thinking this, he went swiftly on with: "Besides I don't want to
get married so soon. It means too much to me at this time. In the
first place I'm not old enough and I haven't got anything to get
married on. And I can't leave here. I couldn't do half as well
anywhere else. You don't realize what this chance means to me. My
father's all right, but he couldn't do what my uncle could and he
wouldn't. You don't know or you wouldn't ask me to do this."</p>

<p>He paused, his face a picture of puzzled fear and opposition. He
was not unlike a harried animal, deftly pursued by hunter and
hound. But Roberta, imagining that his total defection had been
caused by the social side of Lycurgus as opposed to her own low
state and not because of the superior lure of any particular girl,
now retorted resentfully, although she desired not to appear so:
"Oh, yes, I know well enough why you can't leave. It isn't your
position here, though, half as much as it is those society people
you are always running around with. I know. You don't care for me
any more, Clyde, that's it, and you don't want to give these other
people up for me. I know that's it and nothing else. But just the
same it wasn't so very long ago that you did, although you don't
seem to remember it now." Her cheeks burned and her eyes flamed as
she said this. She paused a moment while he gazed at her wondering
about the outcome of all this. "But you can't leave me to make out
any way I can, just the same, because I won't be left this way,
Clyde. I can't! I can't! I tell you." She grew tense and staccato,
"It means too much to me. I don't know how to do alone and I,
besides, have no one to turn to but you and you must help me. I've
got to get out of this, that's all, Clyde, I've got to. I'm not
going to be left to face my people and everybody without any help
or marriage or anything." As she said this, her eyes turned
appealingly and yet savagely toward him and she emphasized it all
with her hands, which she clinched and unclinched in a dramatic
way. "And if you can't help me out in the way you thought," she
went on most agonizedly as Clyde could see, "then you've got to
help me out in this other, that's all. At least until I can do for
myself I just won't be left. I don't ask you to marry me forever,"
she now added, the thought that if by presenting this demand in
some modified form, she could induce Clyde to marry her, it might
be possible afterwards that his feeling toward her would change to
a much more kindly one. "You can leave me after a while if you want
to. After I'm out of this. I can't prevent you from doing that and
I wouldn't want to if I could. But you can't leave me now. You
can't. You can't! Besides," she added, "I didn't want to get myself
in this position and I wouldn't have, but for you. But you made me
and made me let you come in here. And now you want to leave me to
shift for myself, just because you think you won't be able to go in
society any more, if they find out about me."</p>

<p>She paused, the strain of this contest proving almost too much
for her tired nerves. At the same time she began to sob nervously
and yet not violently&mdash;a marked effort at self-restraint and
recovery marking her every gesture. And after a moment or two in
which both stood there, he gazing dumbly and wondering what else he
was to say in answer to all this, she struggling and finally
managing to recover her poise, she added: "Oh, what is it about me
that's so different to what I was a couple of months ago, Clyde?
Will you tell me that? I'd like to know. What is it that has caused
you to change so? Up to Christmas, almost, you were as nice to me
as any human being could be. You were with me nearly all the time
you had, and since then I've scarcely had an evening that I didn't
beg for. Who is it? What is it? Some other girl, or what, I'd like
to know&mdash;that Sondra Finchley or Bertine Cranston, or
who?"</p>

<p>Her eyes as she said this were a study. For even to this hour,
as Clyde could now see to his satisfaction, since he feared the
effect on Roberta of definite and absolute knowledge concerning
Sondra, she had no specific suspicion, let alone positive knowledge
concerning any girl. And coward-wise, in the face of her present
predicament and her assumed and threatened claims on him, he was
afraid to say what or who the real cause of this change was.
Instead he merely replied and almost unmoved by her sorrow, since
he no longer really cared for her: "Oh, you're all wrong, Bert. You
don't see what the trouble is. It's my future here&mdash;if I leave
here I certainly will never find such an opportunity. And if I have
to marry in this way or leave here it will all go flooey. I want to
wait and get some place first before I marry, see&mdash;save some
money and if I do this I won't have a chance and you won't either,"
he added feebly, forgetting for the moment that up to this time he
had been indicating rather clearly that he did not want to have
anything more to do with her in any way.</p>

<p>"Besides," he continued, "if you could only find some one, or if
you would go away by yourself somewhere for a while, Bert, and go
through with this alone, I could send you the money to do it on, I
know. I could have it between now and the time you had to go."</p>

<p>His face, as he said this, and as Roberta clearly saw, mirrored
the complete and resourceless collapse of all his recent plans in
regard to her. And she, realizing that his indifference to her had
reached the point where he could thus dispose of her and their
prospective baby in this casual and really heartless manner, was
not only angered in part, but at the same time frightened by the
meaning of it all.</p>

<p>"Oh, Clyde," she now exclaimed boldly and with more courage and
defiance than at any time since she had known him, "how you have
changed! And how hard you can be. To want me to go off all by
myself and just to save you&mdash;so you can stay here and get
along and marry some one here when I am out of the way and you
don't have to bother about me any more. Well, I won't do it. It's
not fair. And I won't, that's all. I won't. And that's all there is
to it. You can get some one to get me out of this or you can marry
me and come away with me, at least long enough for me to have the
baby and place myself right before my people and every one else
that knows me. I don't care if you leave me afterwards, because I
see now that you really don't care for me any more, and if that's
the way you feel, I don't want you any more than you want me. But
just the same, you must help me now&mdash;you must. But, oh, dear,"
she began whimpering again, and yet only slightly and bitterly. "To
think that all our love for each other should have come to
this&mdash;that I am asked to go away by myself&mdash;all
alone&mdash;with no one&mdash;while you stay here, oh, dear! oh,
dear! And with a baby on my hands afterwards. And no husband."</p>

<p>She clinched her hands and shook her head bleakly. Clyde,
realizing well enough that his proposition certainly was cold and
indifferent but, in the face of his intense desire for Sondra, the
best or at least safest that he could devise, now stood there
unable for the moment to think of anything more to say.</p>

<p>And although there was some other discussion to the same effect,
the conclusion of this very difficult hour was that Clyde had
another week or two at best in which to see if he could find a
physician or any one who would assist him. After that&mdash;well
after that the implied, if not openly expressed, threat which lay
at the bottom of this was, unless so extricated and speedily, that
he would have to marry her, if not permanently, then at least
temporarily, but legally just the same, until once again she was
able to look after herself&mdash;a threat which was as crushing and
humiliating to Roberta as it was torturing to him.</p>

<h3>Chapter 39</h3>

<p>Opposing views such as these, especially where no real skill to
meet such a situation existed, could only spell greater difficulty
and even eventual disaster unless chance in some form should aid.
And chance did not aid. And the presence of Roberta in the factory
was something that would not permit him to dismiss it from his
mind. If only he could persuade her to leave and go somewhere else
to live and work so that he should not always see her, he might
then think more calmly. For with her asking continuously, by her
presence if no more, what he intended to do, it was impossible for
him to think. And the fact that he no longer cared for her as he
had, tended to reduce his normal consideration of what was her due.
He was too infatuated with, and hence disarranged by his thoughts
of Sondra.</p>

<p>For in the very teeth of this grave dilemma he continued to
pursue the enticing dream in connection with Sondra&mdash;the dark
situation in connection with Roberta seeming no more at moments
than a dark cloud which shadowed this other. And hence nightly, or
as often as the exigencies of his still unbroken connection with
Roberta would permit, he was availing himself of such opportunities
as his flourishing connections now afforded. Now, and to his great
pride and satisfaction, it was a dinner at the Harriets' or
Taylors' to which he was invited; or a party at the Finchleys' or
the Cranstons', to which he would either escort Sondra or be
animated by the hope of encountering her. And now, also without so
many of the former phases or attempts at subterfuge, which had
previously characterized her curiosity in regard to him, she was at
times openly seeking him out and making opportunities for social
contact. And, of course, these contacts being identical with this
typical kind of group gathering, they seemed to have no special
significance with the more conservative elders.</p>

<p>For although Mrs. Finchley, who was of an especially shrewd and
discerning turn socially, had at first been dubious over the
attentions being showered upon Clyde by her daughter and others,
still observing that Clyde was more and more being entertained, not
only in her own home by the group of which her daughter was a part,
but elsewhere, everywhere, was at last inclined to imagine that he
must be more solidly placed in this world than she had heard, and
later to ask her son and even Sondra concerning him. But receiving
from Sondra only the equivocal information that, since he was Gil
and Bella Griffiths' cousin, and was being taken up by everybody
because he was so charming&mdash;even if he didn't have any
money&mdash;she couldn't see why she and Stuart should not be
allowed to entertain him also, her mother rested on that for the
time being&mdash;only cautioning her daughter under no
circumstances to become too friendly. And Sondra, realizing that in
part her mother was right, yet being so drawn to Clyde was now
determined to deceive her, at least to the extent of being as
clandestinely free with Clyde as she could contrive. And was, so
much so that every one who was privy to the intimate contacts
between Clyde and Sondra might have reported that the actual
understanding between them was assuming an intensity which most
certainly would have shocked the elder Finchleys, could they have
known. For apart from what Clyde had been, and still was dreaming
in regard to her, Sondra was truly being taken with thoughts and
moods in regard to him which were fast verging upon the most
destroying aspects of the very profound chemistry of love. Indeed,
in addition to handclasps, kisses and looks of intense admiration
always bestowed when presumably no one was looking, there were
those nebulous and yet strengthening and lengthening fantasies
concerning a future which in some way or other, not clear to either
as yet, was still always to include each other.</p>

<p>Summer days perhaps, and that soon, in which he and she would be
in a canoe at Twelfth Lake, the long shadows of the trees on the
bank lengthening over the silvery water, the wind rippling the
surface while he paddled and she idled and tortured him with hints
of the future; a certain forest path, grass-sodden and sun-mottled
to the south and west of the Cranston and Phant estates, near
theirs, through which they might canter in June and July to a
wonderful view known as Inspiration Point some seven miles west;
the country fair at Sharon, at which, in a gypsy costume, the
essence of romance itself, she would superintend a booth, or, in
her smartest riding habit, give an exhibition of her
horsemanship&mdash;teas, dances in the afternoon and in the
moonlight at which, languishing in his arms, their eyes would
speak.</p>

<p>None of the compulsion of the practical. None of the inhibitions
which the dominance and possible future opposition of her parents
might imply. Just love and summer, and idyllic and happy progress
toward an eventual secure and unopposed union which should give him
to her forever.</p>

<p>And in the meantime, in so far as Roberta was concerned, two
more long, dreary, terrifying months going by without that
meditated action on her part which must result once it was taken in
Clyde's undoing. For, as convinced as she was that apart from
meditating and thinking of some way to escape his responsibility,
Clyde had no real intention of marrying her, still, like Clyde, she
drifted, fearing to act really. For in several conferences
following that in which she had indicated that she expected him to
marry her, he had reiterated, if vaguely, a veiled threat that in
case she appealed to his uncle he would not be compelled to marry
her, after all, for he could go elsewhere.</p>

<p>The way he put it was that unless left undisturbed in his
present situation he would be in no position to marry her and
furthermore could not possibly do anything to aid her at the coming
time when most of all she would stand in need of aid&mdash;a hint
which caused Roberta to reflect on a hitherto not fully developed
vein of hardness in Clyde, although had she but sufficiently
reflected, it had shown itself at the time that he compelled her to
admit him to her room.</p>

<p>In addition and because she was doing nothing and yet he feared
that at any moment she might, he shifted in part at least from the
attitude of complete indifference, which had availed him up to the
time that she had threatened him, to one of at least simulated
interest and good-will and friendship. For the very precarious
condition in which he found himself was sufficiently terrifying to
evoke more diplomacy than ever before had characterized him.
Besides he was foolish enough to hope, if not exactly believe, that
by once more conducting himself as though he still entertained a
lively sense of the problem that afflicted her and that he was
willing, in case no other way was found, to eventually marry her
(though he could never definitely be persuaded to commit himself as
to this), he could reduce her determination to compel him to act
soon at least to a minimum, and so leave him more time in which to
exhaust every possibility of escape without marriage, and without
being compelled to run away.</p>

<p>And although Roberta sensed the basis of this sudden shift,
still she was so utterly alone and distrait that she was willing to
give ear to Clyde's mock genial, if not exactly affectionate
observations and suggestions. It caused her, at his behest, to wait
a while longer, the while, as he now explained, he would not only
have saved up some money, but devised some plan in connection with
his work which would permit him to leave for a time anyhow, marry
her somewhere and then establish her and the baby as a lawful
married woman somewhere else, while, although he did not explain
this just now, he returned to Lycurgus and sent her such aid as he
could. But on condition, of course, that never anywhere, unless he
gave her permission, must she assert that he had married her, or
point to him in any way as the father of her child. Also it was
understood that she, as she herself had asserted over and over that
she would, if only he would do this&mdash;marry her&mdash;take
steps to free herself on the ground of desertion, or something, in
some place sufficiently removed from Lycurgus for no one to hear.
And that within a reasonable time after her marriage to him,
although he was not at all satisfied that, assuming that he did
marry her, she would.</p>

<p>But Clyde, of course, was insincere in regard to all his
overtures at this time, and really not concerned as to her
sincerity or insincerity. Nor did he have any intention of leaving
Lycurgus even for the moderate length of time that her present
extrication would require unless he had to. For that meant that he
would be separated from Sondra, and such absence, for whatever
period, would most definitely interfere with his plans. And so, on
the contrary, he drifted&mdash;thinking most idly at times of some
possible fake or mock marriage such as he had seen in some
melodramatic movie&mdash;a fake minister and witnesses combining to
deceive some simple country girl such as Roberta was not, but at
such expense of time, resources, courage and subtlety as Clyde
himself, after a little reflection, was wise enough to see was
beyond him.</p>

<p>Again, knowing that, unless some hitherto unforeseen aid should
eventuate, he was heading straight toward a disaster which could
not much longer be obviated, he even allowed himself to dream that,
once the fatal hour was at hand and Roberta, no longer to be put
off by any form of subterfuge, was about to expose him, he might
even flatly deny that he had ever held any such relationship with
her as then she would be charging&mdash;rather that at all times
his relationship with her had been that of a department manager to
employee&mdash;no more. Terror&mdash;no less!</p>

<p>But at the same time, early in May, when Roberta, because of
various gestative signs and ailments, was beginning to explain, as
well as insist, to Clyde that by no stretch of the imagination or
courage could she be expected to retain her position at the factory
or work later than June first, because by then the likelihood of
the girls there beginning to notice something, would be too great
for her to endure, Sondra was beginning to explain that not so much
later than the fourth or fifth of June she and her mother and
Stuart, together with some servants, would be going to their new
lodge at Twelfth Lake in order to supervise certain installations
then being made before the regular season should begin. And after
that, not later than the eighteenth, at which time the Cranstons,
Harriets, and some others would have arrived, including very likely
visits from Bella and Myra, he might expect a week-end invitation
from the Cranstons, with whom, through Bertine, she would arrange
as to this. And after that, the general circumstances proving
fairly propitious, there would be, of course, other week-end
invitations to the Harriets', Phants' and some others who dwelt
there, as well as to the Griffiths' at Greenwood, to which place,
on account of Bella, he could easily come. And during his two
weeks' vacation in July, he could either stop at the Casino, which
was at Pine Point, or perhaps the Cranstons or Harriets, at her
suggestion, might choose to invite him. At any rate, as Clyde could
see, and with no more than such expenditures as, with a little
scrimping during his ordinary working days here, he could provide
for, he might see not a little of that lake life of which he had
read so much in the local papers, to say nothing of Sondra at one
and another of the lodges, the masters of which were not so
inimical to his presence and overtures as were Sondra's
parents.</p>

<p>For now it was, and for the first time, as she proceeded to
explain to him that her mother and father, because of his continued
and reported attentions to her, were already beginning to talk of
an extended European tour which might keep her and Stuart and her
mother abroad for at least the next two years. But since, at news
of this, Clyde's face as well as his spirits darkened, and she
herself was sufficiently enmeshed to suffer because of this, she at
once added that he must not feel so bad&mdash;he must not; things
would work out well enough, she knew. For at the proper time, and
unless between then and now, something&mdash;her own subtle attack
if not her at present feverish interest in Clyde&mdash;should have
worked to alter her mother's viewpoint in regard to him&mdash;she
might be compelled to take some steps of her own in order to
frustrate her mother. Just what, she was not willing to say at this
time, although to Clyde's overheated imagination it took the form
of an elopement and marriage, which could not then be gainsaid by
her parents whatever they might think. And it was true that in a
vague and as yet repressed way some such thought was beginning to
form in Sondra's mind. For, as she now proceeded to explain to
Clyde, it was so plain that her mother was attempting to steer her
in the direction of a purely social match&mdash;the one with the
youth who had been paying her such marked attention the year
before. But because of her present passion for Clyde, as she now
gayly declared, it was not easy to see how she was to be made to
comply. "The only trouble with me is that I'm not of age yet," she
here added briskly and slangily. "They've got me there, of course.
But I will be by next October and they can't do very much with me
after that, I want to let you know. I can marry the person I want,
I guess. And if I can't do it here, well, there are more ways than
one to kill a cat."</p>

<p>The thought was like some sweet, disarranging poison to Clyde.
It fevered and all but betrayed him mentally. If only&mdash;if
only&mdash;it were not for Roberta now. That terrifying and all but
insoluble problem. But for that, and the opposition of Sondra's
parents which she was thinking she would be able to overcome, did
not heaven itself await him? Sondra, Twelfth Lake, society, wealth,
her love and beauty. He grew not a little wild in thinking of it
all. Once he and she were married, what could Sondra's relatives
do? What, but acquiesce and take them into the glorious bosom of
their resplendent home at Lycurgus or provide for them in some
other way&mdash;he to no doubt eventually take some place in
connection with the Finchley Electric Sweeper Company. And then
would he not be the equal, if not the superior, of Gilbert
Griffiths himself and all those others who originally had ignored
him here&mdash;joint heir with Stuart to all the Finchley means.
And with Sondra as the central or crowning jewel to so much sudden
and such Aladdin-like splendor.</p>

<p>No thought as to how he was to overcome the time between now and
October. No serious consideration of the fact that Roberta then and
there was demanding that he marry her. He could put her off, he
thought. And yet, at the same time, he was painfully and nervously
conscious of the fact that at no period in his life before had he
been so treacherously poised at the very brink of disaster. It
might be his duty as the world would see it&mdash;his mother would
say so&mdash;to at least extricate Roberta. But in the case of
Esta, who had come to her rescue? Her lover? He had walked off from
her without a qualm and she had not died. And why, when Roberta was
no worse off than his sister had been, why should she seek to
destroy him in this way? Force him to do something which would be
little less than social, artistic, passional or emotional
assassination? And when later, if she would but spare him for this,
he could do so much more for her&mdash;with Sondra's money of
course. He could not and would not let her do this to him. His life
would be ruined!</p>

<h3>Chapter 40</h3>

<p>Two incidents which occurred at this time tended still more to
sharpen the contrary points of view holding between Clyde and
Roberta. One of these was no more than a glimpse which Roberta had
one evening of Clyde pausing at the Central Avenue curb in front of
the post-office to say a few words to Arabella Stark, who in a
large and impressive-looking car, was waiting for her father who
was still in the Stark Building opposite. And Miss Stark,
fashionably outfitted according to the season, her world and her
own pretentious taste, was affectedly posed at the wheel, not only
for the benefit of Clyde but the public in general. And to Roberta,
who by now was reduced to the verge of distraction between Clyde's
delay and her determination to compel him to act in her behalf, she
appeared to be little less than an epitome of all the security,
luxury and freedom from responsibility which so enticed and hence
caused Clyde to delay and be as indifferent as possible to the dire
state which confronted her. For, alas, apart from this claim of her
condition, what had she to offer him comparable to all he would be
giving up in case he acceded to her request? Nothing&mdash; a
thought which was far from encouraging.</p>

<p>Yet, at this moment contrasting her own wretched and neglected
state with that of this Miss Stark, for example, she found herself
a prey to an even more complaining and antagonistic mood than had
hitherto characterized her. It was not right. It was not fair. For
during the several weeks that had passed since last they had
discussed this matter, Clyde had scarcely said a word to her at the
factory or elsewhere, let alone called upon her at her room,
fearing as he did the customary inquiry which he could not satisfy.
And this caused her to feel that not only was he neglecting but
resenting her most sharply.</p>

<p>And yet as she walked home from this trivial and fairly
representative scene, her heart was not nearly so angry as it was
sad and sore because of the love and comfort that had vanished and
was not likely ever to come again...ever...ever...ever. Oh, how
terrible...how terrible!</p>

<p>On the other hand, Clyde, and at approximately this same time,
was called upon to witness a scene identified with Roberta, which,
as some might think, only an ironic and even malicious fate could
have intended or permitted to come to pass. For motoring north the
following Sunday to Arrow Lake to the lodge of the Trumbulls' to
take advantage of an early spring week-end planned by Sondra, the
party on nearing Biltz, which was in the direct line of the trip,
was compelled to detour east in the direction of Roberta's home.
And coming finally to a north and south road which ran directly
from Trippettsville past the Alden farm, they turned north into
that. And a few minutes later, came directly to the corner
adjoining the Alden farm, where an east and west road led to Biltz.
Here Tracy Trumbull, driving at the time, requested that some one
should get out and inquire at the adjacent farm-house as to whether
this road did lead to Biltz. And Clyde, being nearest to one door,
jumped out. And then, glancing at the name on the mail-box which
stood at the junction and evidently belonged to the extremely
dilapidated old farm-house on the rise above, he was not a little
astonished to note that the name was that of Titus
Alden&mdash;Roberta's father. Also, as it instantly came to him,
since she had described her parents as being near Biltz, this must
be her home. It gave him pause, caused him for the moment to
hesitate as to whether to go on or not, for once he had given
Roberta a small picture of himself, and she might have shown it up
here. Again the mere identification of this lorn, dilapidated realm
with Roberta and hence himself, was sufficient to cause him to wish
to turn and run.</p>

<p>But Sondra, who was sitting next him in the car and now noting
his hesitation, called: "What's the matter, Clyde? Afraid of the
bow-wow?" And he, realizing instantly that they would comment
further on his actions if he did not proceed at once, started up
the path. But the effect of this house, once he contemplated it
thoroughly, was sufficient to arouse in his brain the most troubled
and miserable of thoughts. For what a house, to be sure! So lonely
and bare, even in this bright, spring weather! The decayed and
sagging roof. The broken chimney to the north&mdash;rough lumps of
cemented field stones lying at its base; the sagging and
semi-toppling chimney to the south, sustained in place by a log
chain. The unkempt path from the road below, which slowly he
ascended! He was not a little dejected by the broken and displaced
stones which served as steps before the front door. And the
unpainted dilapidated out-buildings, all the more dreary because of
these others.</p>

<p>"Gee!" To think that this was Roberta's home. And to think, in
the face of all that he now aspired to in connection with Sondra
and this social group at Lycurgus, she should be demanding that he
marry her! And Sondra in the car with him here to see&mdash;if not
know. The poverty! The reduced grimness of it all. How far he had
traveled away from just such a beginning as this!</p>

<p>With a weakening and sickening sensation at the pit of his
stomach, as of some blow administered there, he now approached the
door. And then, as if to further distress him, if that were
possible, the door was opened by Titus Alden, who, in an old,
thread-bare and out-at-elbows coat, as well as baggy, worn, jean
trousers and rough, shineless, ill-fitting country shoes, desired
by his look to know what he wanted. And Clyde, being taken aback by
the clothes, as well as a marked resemblance to Roberta about the
eyes and mouth, now as swiftly as possible asked if the east and
west road below ran through Biltz and joined the main highway
north. And although he would have preferred a quick "yes" so that
he might have turned and gone, Titus preferred to step down into
the yard and then, with a gesture of the arm, indicate that if they
wanted to strike a really good part of the road, they had better
follow this Trippettsville north and south road for at least two
more miles, and then turn west. Clyde thanked him briefly and
turned almost before he had finished and hurried away.</p>

<p>For, as he now recalled, and with an enormous sense of
depression, Roberta was thinking and at this very time, that soon
now, and in the face of all Lycurgus had to offer
him&mdash;Sondra&mdash;the coming spring and summer&mdash;the love
and romance, gayety, position, power&mdash; he was going to give
all that up and go away with and marry her. Sneak away to some
out-of-the-way place! Oh, how horrible! And with a child at his
age! Oh, why had he ever been so foolish and weak as to identify
himself with her in this intimate way? Just because of a few lonely
evenings! Oh, why, why couldn't he have waited and then this other
world would have opened up to him just the same? If only he could
have waited!</p>

<p>And now unquestionably, unless he could speedily and easily
disengage himself from her, all this other splendid recognition
would be destined to be withdrawn from him, and this other world
from which he sprang might extend its gloomy, poverty-stricken arms
to him and envelop him once more, just as the poverty of his family
had enveloped and almost strangled him from the first. And it even
occurred to him, in a vague way for the first time, how strange it
was that this girl and he, whose origin had been strikingly
similar, should have been so drawn to each other in the beginning.
Why should it have been? How strange life was, anyway? But even
more harrowing than this, was the problem of a way out that was
before him. And his mind from now on, on this trip, was once more
searching for some solution. A word of complaint from Roberta or
her parents to his uncle or Gilbert, and assuredly he would be done
for.</p>

<p>The thought so troubled him that once in the car, and although
previously he had been chattering along with the others about what
might be in store ahead in the way of divertissement, he now sat
silent. And Sondra, who sat next to him and who previously had been
whispering at intervals of her plans for the summer, now, instead
of resuming the patter, whispered: "What come over de sweet phing?"
(When Clyde appeared to be the least reduced in mind she most
affected this patter with him, since it had an almost electric, if
sweetly tormenting effect on him. "His baby-talking girl," he
sometimes called her.) "Facey all dark now. Little while ago facey
all smiles. Come make facey all nice again. Smile at Sondra.
Squeeze Sondra's arm like good boy, Clyde."</p>

<p>She turned and looked up into his eyes to see what if any effect
this baby-worded cajolery was having, and Clyde did his best to
brighten, of course. But even so, and in the face of all this
amazingly wonderful love on her part for him, the specter of
Roberta and all that she represented now in connection with all
this, was ever before him&mdash;her state, her very recent edict in
regard to it, the obvious impossibility of doing anything now but
go away with her.</p>

<p>Why&mdash;rather than let himself in for a thing like
that&mdash;would it not be better, and even though he lost Sondra
once and for all, for him to decamp as in the instance of the slain
child in Kansas City&mdash;and be heard of nevermore here. But then
he would lose Sondra, his connections here, and his
uncle&mdash;this world! The loss! The loss! The misery of once more
drifting about here and there; of being compelled to write his
mother once more concerning certain things about his flight, which
some one writing from here might explain to her
afterwards&mdash;and so much more damagingly. And the thoughts
concerning him on the part of his relatives! And of late he had
been writing his mother that he was doing so well. What was it
about his life that made things like this happen to him? Was this
what his life was to be like? Running away from one situation and
another just to start all over somewhere else&mdash;perhaps only to
be compelled to flee from something worse. No, he could not run
away again. He must face it and solve it in some way. He must!</p>

<p>God!</p>

<h3>Chapter 41</h3>

<p>The fifth of June arriving, the Finchleys departed as Sondra had
indicated, but not without a most urgent request from her that he
be prepared to come to the Cranstons' either the second or third
week-end following&mdash;she to advise him definitely later&mdash;a
departure which so affected Clyde that he could scarcely think what
to do with himself in her absence, depressed as he was by the
tangle which Roberta's condition presented. And exactly at this
time also, Roberta's fears and demands had become so urgent that it
was really no longer possible for him to assure her that if she
would but wait a little while longer, he would be prepared to act
in her behalf. Plead as he might, her case, as she saw it, was at
last critical and no longer to be trifled with in any way. Her
figure, as she insisted (although this was largely imaginative on
her part), had altered to such an extent that it would not be
possible for her longer to conceal it, and all those who worked
with her at the factory were soon bound to know. She could no
longer work or sleep with any comfort&mdash;she must not stay here
any more. She was having preliminary pains&mdash;purely imaginary
ones in her case. He must marry her now, as he had indicated he
would, and leave with her at once&mdash;for some place&mdash;any
place, really&mdash;near or far&mdash;so long as she was extricated
from this present terrible danger. And she would agree, as she now
all but pleaded, to let him go his way again as soon as their child
was born&mdash;truly&mdash;and would not ask any more of him
ever&mdash;ever. But now, this very week&mdash;not later than the
fifteenth at the latest&mdash;he must arrange to see her through
with this as he had promised.</p>

<p>But this meant that he would be leaving with her before ever he
should have visited Sondra at Twelfth Lake at all, and without ever
seeing her any more really. And, besides, as he so well knew, he
had not saved the sum necessary to make possible the new venture on
which she was insisting. In vain it was that Roberta now explained
that she had saved over a hundred, and they could make use of that
once they were married or to help in connection with whatever
expenses might be incurred in getting to wherever he should decide
they were going. All that he would see or feel was that this meant
the loss of everything to him, and that he would have to go away
with her to some relatively near-by place and get work at anything
he could, in order to support her as best he might. But the misery
of such a change! The loss of all his splendid dreams. And yet,
racking his brains, he could think of nothing better than that she
should quit and go home for the time being, since as he now argued,
and most shrewdly, as he thought, he needed a few more weeks to
prepare for the change which was upon them both. For, in spite of
all his efforts, as he now falsely asserted, he had not been able
to save as much as he had hoped. He needed at least three or four
more weeks in which to complete the sum, which he had been looking
upon as advisable in the face of this meditated change. Was not she
herself guessing, as he knew, that it could not be less than a
hundred and fifty or two hundred dollars&mdash;quite large sums in
her eyes&mdash;whereas, above his current salary, Clyde had no more
than forty dollars and was dreaming of using that and whatever else
he might secure in the interim to meet such expenses as might be
incurred in the anticipated visit to Twelfth Lake.</p>

<p>But to further support his evasive suggestion that she now
return to her home for a short period, he added that she would want
to fix herself up a little, wouldn't she? She couldn't go away on a
trip like this, which involved marriage and a change of social
contacts in every way, without some improvements in her wardrobe.
Why not take her hundred dollars or a part of it anyhow and use it
for that? So desperate was his state that he even suggested that.
And Roberta, who, in the face of her own uncertainty up to this
time as to what was to become of her had not ventured to prepare or
purchase anything relating either to a trousseau or layette, now
began to think that whatever the ulterior purpose of his
suggestion, which like all the others was connected with delay, it
might not be unwise even now if she did take a fortnight or three
weeks, and with the assistance of an inexpensive and yet tolerable
dressmaker, who had aided her sister at times, make at least one or
two suitable dresses&mdash;a flowered gray taffeta afternoon dress,
such as she had once seen in a movie, in which, should Clyde keep
his word, she could be married. To match this pleasing little
costume, she planned to add a chic little gray silk
hat&mdash;poke-shaped, with pink or scarlet cherries nestled up
under the brim, together with a neat little blue serge traveling
suit, which, with brown shoes and a brown hat, would make her as
smart as any bride. The fact that such preparations as these meant
additional delay and expense, or that Clyde might not marry her
after all, or that this proposed marriage from the point of view of
both was the tarnished and discolored thing that it was, was still
not sufficient to take from the thought of marriage as an event, or
sacrament even, that proper color and romance with which it was
invested in her eyes and from which, even under such an
unsatisfactory set of circumstances as these, it could not be
divorced. And, strangely enough, in spite of all the troubled and
strained relations that had developed between them, she still saw
Clyde in much the same light in which she had seen him at first. He
was a Griffiths, a youth of genuine social, if not financial
distinction, one whom all the girls in her position, as well as
many of those far above her, would be delighted to be connected
with in this way&mdash;that is, via marriage. He might be objecting
to marrying her, but he was a person of consequence, just the same.
And one with whom, if he would but trouble to care for her a
little, she could be perfectly happy. And at any rate, once he had
loved her. And it was said of men&mdash; some men, anyway (so she
had heard her mother and others say) that once a child was
presented to them, it made a great difference in their attitude
toward the mother, sometimes. They came to like the mother, too.
Anyhow for a little while&mdash;a very little while&mdash;if what
she had agreed to were strictly observed, she would have him with
her to assist her through this great crisis&mdash;to give his name
to her child&mdash;to aid her until she could once more establish
herself in some way.</p>

<p>For the time being, therefore, and with no more plan than this,
although with great misgivings and nervous qualms, since, as she
could see, Clyde was decidedly indifferent, she rested on this. And
it was in this mood that five days later, and after Roberta had
written to her parents that she was coming home for two weeks at
least, to get a dress or two made and to rest a little, because she
was not feeling very well, that Clyde saw her off for her home in
Biltz, riding with her as far as Fonda. But in so far as he was
concerned, and since he had really no definite or workable idea, it
seemed important to him that only silence, <i>silence</i> was the
great and all essential thing now, so that, even under the
impending edge of the knife of disaster, he might be able to think
more, and more, and more, without being compelled to do anything,
and without momentarily being tortured by the thought that Roberta,
in some nervous or moody or frantic state, would say or do
something which, assuming that he should hit upon some helpful
thought or plan in connection with Sondra, would prevent him from
executing it.</p>

<p>And about the same time, Sondra was writing him gay notes from
Twelfth Lake as to what he might expect upon his arrival a little
later. Blue water&mdash;white
sails&mdash;tennis&mdash;golf-horseback riding&mdash; driving. She
had it all arranged with Bertine, as she said. And
kisses&mdash;kisses&mdash;kisses!</p>

<h3>Chapter 42</h3>

<p>Two letters, which arrived at this time and simultaneously, but
accentuated the difficulty of all this.</p>

<blockquote>Pine Point Landing, June 10th<br>
<br>
CLYDE MYDIE:<br>
<br>
How is my pheet phing? All whytie? It's just glorious up here. Lots
of people already here and more coming every day. The Casino and
golf course over at Pine Point are open and lots of people about. I
can hear Stuart and Grant with their launches going up toward
Gray's Inlet now. You must hurry and come up, dear. It's too nice
for words. Green roads to gallop through, and swimming and dancing
at the Casino every afternoon at four. Just back from a wonderful
gallop on Dickey and going again after luncheon to mail these
letters. Bertine says she'll write you a letter to-day or tomorrow
good for any week-end or any old time, so when Sonda says come, you
come, you hear, else Sonda whip hard. You baddie, good boy.<br>
<br>
Is he working hard in the baddie old factory? Sonda wisses he was
here wiss her instead. We'd ride and drive and swim and dance.
Don't forget your tennis racquet and golf clubs. There's a dandy
course on the Casino grounds.<br>
<br>
This morning when I was riding a bird flew right up under Dickey's
heels. It scared him so that he bolted, and Sonda got all switched
and scwatched. Isn't Clydie sorry for his Sonda?<br>
<br>
She is writing lots of notes to-day. After lunch and the ride to
catch the down mail, Sonda and Bertine and Nina going to the
Casino. Don't you wish you were going to be there? We could dance
to "Taudy." Sonda just loves that song. But she has to dress now.
More to-morrow, baddie boy. And when Bertine writes, answer right
away. See all 'ose dots? Kisses. Big and little ones. All for
baddie boy. And wite Sonda every day and she'll write 'oo.<br>
<br>
More kisses.</blockquote>

<p>To which Clyde responded eagerly and in kind in the same hour.
But almost the same mail, at least the same day, brought the
following letter from Roberta.</p>

<blockquote>Biltz, June 10th.<br>
<br>
DEAR CLYDE:<br>
<br>
I am nearly ready for bed, but I will write you a few lines. I had
such a tiresome journey coming up that I was nearly sick. In the
first place I didn't want to come much (alone) as you know. I feel
too upset and uncertain about everything, although I try not to
feel so now that we have our plan and you are going to come for me
as you said.</blockquote>

<p>(At this point, while nearly sickened by the thought of the
wretched country world in which she lived, still, because of
Roberta's unfortunate and unavoidable relation to it, he now
experienced one of his old time twinges of remorse and pity in
regard to her. For after all, this was not her fault. She had so
little to look forward to&mdash;nothing but her work or a
commonplace marriage. For the first time in many days, really, and
in the absence of both, he was able to think clearly&mdash;and to
sympathize deeply, if gloomily. For the remainder of the letter
read:)</p>

<blockquote>But it's very nice here now. The trees are so
beautifully green and the flowers in bloom. I can hear the bees in
the orchard whenever I go near the south windows. On the way up
instead of coming straight home I decided to stop at Homer to see
my sister and brother-in-law, since I am not so sure now when I
shall see them again, if ever, for I am resolved that they shall
see me respectable, or never at all any more. You mustn't think I
mean anything hard or mean by this. I am just sad. They have such a
cute little home there, Clyde&mdash;pretty furniture, a victrola
and all, and Agnes is so very happy with Fred. I hope she always
will be. I couldn't help thinking of what a dear place we might
have had, if only my dreams had come true. And nearly all the time
I was there Fred kept teasing me as to why I don't get married,
until I said, "Oh, well, Fred, you mustn't be too sure that I won't
one of these days. All good things come to him who waits, you
know." "Yes, unless you just turn out to be a waiter," was the way
he hit me back.<br>
<br>
But I was truly glad to see mother again, Clyde. She's so loving
and patient and helpful. The sweetest, dearest mother that ever,
ever was. And I just hate to hurt her in any way. And Tom and
Emily, too. They have had friends here every evening since I've
been here&mdash;and they want me to join in, but I hardly feel well
enough now to do all the things they want me to do&mdash;play cards
and games&mdash;dance.</blockquote>

<p>(At this point Clyde could not help emphasizing in his own mind
the shabby home world of which she was a part and which so recently
he had seen&mdash;that rickety house! those toppling chimneys! Her
uncouth father. And that in contrast to such a letter as this other
from Sondra.)</p>

<blockquote>Father and mother and Tom and Emily just seem to hang
around and try to do things for me. And I feel remorseful when I
think how they would feel if they knew, for, of course, I have to
pretend that it is work that makes me feel so tired and depressed
as I am sometimes. Mother keeps saying that I must stay a long time
or quit entirely and rest and get well again, but she just don't
know of course&mdash;poor dear. If she did! I can't tell you how
that makes me feel sometimes, Clyde. Oh, dear!<br>
<br>
But there, I mustn't put my sad feelings over on you either. I
don't want to, as I told you, if you will only come and get me as
we've agreed. And I won't be like that either, Clyde. I'm not that
way all the time now. I've started to get ready and do all the
things it'll take to do in three weeks and that's enough to keep my
mind off everything but work. But you will come for me, won't you,
dear? You won't disappoint me any more and make me suffer this time
like you have so far, for, oh, how long it has been now&mdash;ever
since I was here before at Christmas time, really. But you were
truly nice to me. I promise not to be a burden on you, for I know
you don't really care for me any more and so I don't care much what
happens now, so long as I get out of this. But I truly promise not
to be a burden on you.<br>
<br>
Oh, dear, don't mind this blot. I just don't seem to be able to
control myself these days like I once could.<br>
<br>
But as for what I came for. The family think they are clothes for a
party down in Lycurgus and that I must be having a wonderful time.
Well, it's better that way than the other. I may have to come as
far as Fonda to get some things, if I don't send Mrs. Anse, the
dressmaker, and if so, and if you wanted to see me again before you
come, although I don't suppose you do, you could. I'd like to see
you and talk to you again if you care to, before we start. It all
seems so funny to me, Clyde, having these clothes made and wishing
to see you so much and yet knowing that you would rather not do
this. And yet I hope you are satisfied now that you have succeeded
in making me leave Lycurgus and come up here and are having what
you call a good time. Are they so very much better than the ones we
used to have last summer when we went about to the lakes and
everywhere? But whatever they are, Clyde, surely you can afford to
do this for me without feeling too bad. I know it seems hard to you
now, but you don't want to forget either that if I was like some
that I know, I might and would ask more. But as I told you I'm not
like that and never could be. If you don't really want me after you
have helped me out like I said, you can go.<br>
<br>
Please write me, Clyde, a long, cheery letter, even though you
don't want to, and tell me all about how you have not thought of me
once since I've been away or missed me at all&mdash;you used to,
you know, and how you don't want me to come back and you can't
possibly come up before two weeks from Saturday if then.<br>
<br>
Oh, dear, I don't mean the horrid things I write, but I'm so blue
and tired and lonely that I can't help it at times. I need some one
to talk to&mdash;not just any one here, because they don't
understand, and I can't tell anybody.<br>
<br>
But there, I said I wouldn't be blue or gloomy or cross and yet I
haven't done so very well this time, have I? But I promise to do
better next time&mdash;tomorrow or next day, because it relieves me
to write to you, Clyde. And won't you please write me just a few
words to cheer me up while I'm waiting, whether you mean it or not,
I need it so. And you will come, of course. I'll be so happy and
grateful and try not to bother you too much in any way.<br>
<br>
Your lonely<br>
<br>
BERT</blockquote>

<p>And it was the contrast presented by these two scenes which
finally determined for him the fact that he would never marry
Roberta&mdash; never&mdash;nor even go to her at Biltz, or let her
come back to him here, if he could avoid that. For would not his
going, or her return, put a period to all the joys that so recently
in connection with Sondra had come to him here&mdash;make it
impossible for him to be with Sondra at Twelfth Lake this
summer&mdash;make it impossible for him to run away with and marry
her? In God's name was there no way? No outlet from this horrible
difficulty which now confronted him?</p>

<p>And in a fit of despair, having found the letters in his room on
his return from work one warm evening in June, he now threw himself
upon his bed and fairly groaned. The misery of this! The horror of
his almost insoluble problem! Was there no way by which she could
be persuaded to go away&mdash;and stay&mdash;remain at home, maybe
for a while longer, while he sent her ten dollars a week, or
twelve, even&mdash;a full half of all his salary? Or could she go
to some neighboring town&mdash;Fonda, Gloversville,
Schenectady&mdash;she was not so far gone but what she could take
care of herself well enough as yet, and rent a room and remain
there quietly until the fatal time, when she could go to some
doctor or nurse? He might help her to find some one like that when
the time came, if only she would be willing not to mention his
name.</p>

<p>But this business of making him come to Biltz, or meeting her
somewhere, and that within two weeks or less. He would not, he
would not. He would do something desperate if she tried to make him
do that&mdash;run away&mdash;or&mdash;maybe go up to Twelfth Lake
before it should be time for him to go to Biltz, or before she
would think it was time, and then persuade Sondra if he
could&mdash;but oh, what a wild, wild chance was that&mdash;to run
away with and marry him, even if she wasn't quite
eighteen&mdash;and then&mdash;and then&mdash;being married, and her
family not being able to divorce them, and Roberta not being able
to find him, either, but only to complain&mdash;well, couldn't he
deny it&mdash;say that it was not so&mdash;that he had never had
any relationship, other than that which any department head might
have with any girl working for him. He had not been introduced to
the Gilpins, nor had he gone with Roberta to see that Dr. Glenn
near Gloversville, and she had told him at the time, she had not
mentioned his name.</p>

<p>But the nerve of trying to deny it!</p>

<p>The courage it would take.</p>

<p>The courage to try to face Roberta when, as he knew, her steady,
accusing, horrified, innocent, blue eyes would be about as
difficult to face as anything in all the world. And could he do
that? Had he the courage? And would it all work out satisfactorily
if he did? Would Sondra believe him&mdash;once she heard?</p>

<p>But just the same in pursuance of this idea, whether finally he
executed it or not, even though he went to Twelfth Lake, he must
write Sondra a letter saying that he was coming. And this he did at
once, writing her passionately and yearningly. At the same time he
decided not to write Roberta at all. Maybe call her on long
distance, since she had recently told him that there was a neighbor
near-by who had a telephone, and if for any reason he needed to
reach her, he could use that. For writing her in regard to all
this, even in the most guarded way, would place in her hands, and
at this time, exactly the type of evidence in regard to this
relationship which she would most need, and especially when he was
so determined not to marry her. The trickery of all this! It was
low and shabby, no doubt. Yet if only Roberta had agreed to be a
little reasonable with him, he would never have dreamed of
indulging in any such low and tricky plan as this. But, oh, Sondra!
Sondra! And the great estate that she had described, lying along
the west shore of Twelfth Lake. How beautiful that must be! He
could not help it! He must act and plan as he was doing! He
must!</p>

<p>And forthwith he arose and went to mail the letter to Sondra.
And then while out, having purchased an evening paper and hoping
via the local news of all whom he knew, to divert his mind for the
time being, there, upon the first page of the Times-Union of
Albany, was an item which read:</p>

<blockquote>ACCIDENTAL DOUBLE TRAGEDY AT PASS LAKE&mdash;UPTURNED
CANOE AND FLOATING HATS REVEAL PROBABLE LOSS OF TWO LIVES AT RESORT
NEAR PITTSFIELD&mdash; UNIDENTIFIED BODY OF GIRL
RECOVERED&mdash;THAT OF COMPANION STILL MISSING</blockquote>

<p>Because of his own great interest in canoeing, and indeed in any
form of water life, as well as his own particular skill when it
came to rowing, swimming, diving, he now read with interest:</p>

<blockquote>Pancoast, Mass., June 7th...What proved to be a fatal
boat ride for two, apparently, was taken here day before yesterday
by an unidentified man and girl who came presumably from Pittsfield
to spend the day at Pass Lake, which is fourteen miles north of
this place.<br>
<br>
Tuesday morning a man and a girl, who said to Thomas Lucas, who
conducts the Casino Lunch and Boat House there, that they were from
Pittsfield, rented a small row-boat about ten o'clock in the
morning and with a basket, presumably containing lunch, departed
for the northern end of the lake. At seven o'clock last evening,
when they did not return, Mr. Lucas, in company with his son
Jeffrey, made a tour of the lake in his motor boat and discovered
the row-boat upside down in the shallows near the north shore, but
no trace of the occupants. Thinking at the time that it might be
another instance of renters having decamped in order to avoid
payment, he returned the boat to his own dock.<br>
<br>
But this morning, doubtful as to whether or not an accident had
occurred, he and his assistant, Fred Walsh, together with his son,
made a second tour of the north shore and finally came upon the
hats of both the girl and the man floating among some rushes near
the shore. At once a dredging party was organized, and by three
o'clock to-day the body of the girl, concerning whom nothing is
known here, other than that she came here with her companion, was
brought up and turned over to the authorities. That of the man has
not yet been found. The water in the immediate vicinity of the
accident in some places being over thirty feet deep, it is not
certain whether the trolling and dredging will yield the other body
or not. In the case of a similar accident which took place here
some fifteen years ago, neither body was ever recovered.<br>
<br>
To the lining of the small jacket which the girl wore was sewed the
tag of a Pittsfield dealer. Also in her shoe lining was stamped the
name of Jacobs of this same city. But other than these there was no
evidence as to her identity. It is assumed by the authorities here
that if she carried a bag of any kind it lies at the bottom of the
lake.<br>
<br>
The man is recalled as being tall, dark, about thirty-five years of
age, and wore a light green suit and straw hat with a white and
blue band. The girl appears to be not more than twenty-five, five
feet five inches tall, and weighs 130 pounds. She wore her hair,
which was long and dark brown, in braids about her forehead. On her
left middle finger is a small gold ring with an amethyst setting.
The police of Pittsfield and other cities in this vicinity have
been notified, but as yet no word as to her identity has been
received.</blockquote>

<p>This item, commonplace enough in the usual grist of summer
accidents, interested Clyde only slightly. It seemed odd, of
course, that a girl and a man should arrive at a small lake
anywhere, and setting forth in a small boat in broad daylight thus
lose their lives. Also it was odd that afterwards no one should be
able to identify either of them. And yet here it was. The man had
disappeared for good. He threw the paper down, little concerned at
first, and turned to other things&mdash;the problem that was
confronting him really&mdash;how he was to do. But later&mdash;and
because of that, and as he was putting out the light before getting
into bed, and still thinking of the complicated problem which his
own life here presented, he was struck by the thought (what devil's
whisper?&mdash; what evil hint of an evil spirit?)&mdash;supposing
that he and Roberta&mdash; no, say he and Sondra&mdash;(no, Sondra
could swim so well, and so could he)&mdash;he and Roberta were in a
small boat somewhere and it should capsize at the very time, say,
of this dreadful complication which was so harassing him? What an
escape? What a relief from a gigantic and by now really destroying
problem! On the other hand&mdash; hold&mdash;not so fast!&mdash;for
could a man even think of such a solution in connection with so
difficult a problem as his without committing a crime in his heart,
really&mdash;a horrible, terrible crime? He must not even think of
such a thing. It was wrong&mdash;wrong&mdash;terribly wrong. And
yet, supposing,&mdash;by accident, of course&mdash;such a thing as
this did occur? That would be the end, then, wouldn't it, of all
his troubles in connection with Roberta? No more terror as to
her&mdash;no more fear and heartache even as to Sondra. A
noiseless, pathless, quarrelless solution of all his present
difficulties, and only joy before him forever. Just an accidental,
unpremeditated drowning&mdash;and then the glorious future which
would be his!</p>

<p>But the mere thinking of such a thing in connection with Roberta
at this time&mdash;(why was it that his mind persisted in
identifying her with it?) was terrible, and he must not, he must
not, allow such a thought to enter his mind. Never, never, never!
He must not. It was horrible! Terrible! A thought of murder, no
less! Murder?!!! Yet so wrought up had he been, and still was, by
the letter which Roberta had written him, as contrasted with the
one from Sondra&mdash;so delightful and enticing was the picture of
her life and his as she now described it, that he could not for the
life of him quite expel that other and seemingly easy and so
natural a solution of all his problem&mdash;if only such an
accident could occur to him and Roberta. For after all he was not
planning any crime, was he? Was he not merely thinking of an
accident that, had it occurred or could it but occur in his
case...Ah&mdash;but that "<i>could it but occur</i>." There was the
dark and evil thought about which he must not, <i>He must not
think</i>. He <i>must not</i>. And yet&mdash;and yet...He was an
excellent swimmer and could swim ashore, no doubt&mdash;whatever
the distance. Whereas Roberta, as he knew from swimming with her at
one beach and another the previous summer, could not swim. And
then&mdash;and then&mdash;well and then, unless he chose to help
her, of course...</p>

<p>As he thought, and for the time, sitting in the lamplight of his
own room between nine-thirty and ten at night, a strange and
disturbing creepiness as to flesh and hair and finger-tips assailed
him. The wonder and the horror of such a thought! And presented to
him by this paper in this way. Wasn't that strange? Besides, up in
that lake country to which he was now going to Sondra, were many,
many lakes about everywhere&mdash;were there not? Scores up there
where Sondra was. Or so she had said. And Roberta loved the
out-of-doors and the water so&mdash;although she could not
swim&mdash;could not swim&mdash;could not swim. And they or at
least he was going where lakes were, or they might, might they
not&mdash;and if not, why not? since both had talked of some Fourth
of July resort in their planning, their final departure&mdash;he
and Roberta.</p>

<p>But, no! no! The mere thought of an accident such as that in
connection with her, however much he might wish to be rid of
her&mdash; was sinful, dark and terrible! He must not let his mind
run on any such things for even a moment. It was too
wrong&mdash;too vile&mdash;too terrible! Oh, dreadful thought! To
think it should have come to him! And at this time of all
times&mdash;when she was demanding that he go away with her!</p>

<p>Death!</p>

<p>Murder!</p>

<p>The murder of Roberta!</p>

<p>But to escape her of course&mdash;this unreasonable, unshakable,
unchangeable demand of hers! Already he was quite cold, quite
damp&mdash;with the mere thought of it. And
now&mdash;when&mdash;when&mdash;! But he must not think of that!
The death of that unborn child, too!!</p>

<p>But how could any one even think of doing any such thing with
calculation&mdash;deliberately? And yet&mdash;many people were
drowned like that&mdash;boys and girls&mdash;men and
women&mdash;here and there&mdash;everywhere the world over in the
summer time. To be sure, he would not want anything like that to
happen to Roberta. And especially at this time. He was not that
kind of a person, whatever else he was. He was not. He was not. He
was not. The mere thought now caused a damp perspiration to form on
his hands and face. He was not that kind of a person. Decent, sane
people did not think of such things. And so he would not
either&mdash;from this hour on.</p>

<p>In a tremulous state of dissatisfaction with himself&mdash;that
any such grisly thought should have dared to obtrude itself upon
him in this way&mdash;he got up and lit the lamp&mdash;re-read this
disconcerting item in as cold and reprobative way as he could
achieve, feeling that in so doing he was putting anything at which
it hinted far from him once and for all. Then, having done so, he
dressed and went out of the house for a walk&mdash;up Wykeagy
Avenue, along Central Avenue, out Oak, and then back on Spruce and
to Central again&mdash;feeling that he was walking away from the
insinuating thought or suggestion that had so troubled him up to
now. And after a time, feeling better, freer, more natural, more
human, as he so much wished to feel&mdash;he returned to his room,
once more to sleep, with the feeling that he had actually succeeded
in eliminating completely a most insidious and horrible visitation.
He must never think of it again! He must never think of it again.
He must never, never, never think of it&mdash; never.</p>

<p>And then falling into a nervous, feverish doze soon thereafter,
he found himself dreaming of a savage black dog that was trying to
bite him. Having escaped from the fangs of the creature by waking
in terror, he once more fell asleep. But now he was in some very
strange and gloomy place, a wood or a cave or narrow canyon between
deep hills, from which a path, fairly promising at first, seemed to
lead. But soon the path, as he progressed along it, became narrower
and narrower and darker, and finally disappeared entirely. And
then, turning to see if he could not get back as he had come, there
directly behind him were arrayed an entangled mass of snakes that
at first looked more like a pile of brush. But above it waved the
menacing heads of at least a score of reptiles, forked tongues and
agate eyes. And in front now, as he turned swiftly, a horned and
savage animal&mdash;huge, it was&mdash;its heavy tread crushing the
brush&mdash;blocked the path in that direction. And then, horrified
and crying out in hopeless desperation, once more he
awoke&mdash;not to sleep again that night.</p>

<h3>Chapter 43</h3>

<p>Yet a thought such as that of the lake, connected as it was with
the predicament by which he was being faced, and shrink from it
though he might, was not to be dismissed as easily as he desired.
Born as it was of its accidental relation to this personal problem
that was shaking and troubling and all but disarranging his own
none-too-forceful mind, this smooth, seemingly blameless, if
dreadful, blotting out of two lives at Pass Lake, had its weight.
That girl's body&mdash;as some peculiar force in his own brain now
still compelled him to think&mdash;being found, but the man's not.
In that interesting fact&mdash;and this quite in spite of
himself&mdash;lurked a suggestion that insisted upon obtruding
itself on his mind&mdash;to wit, that it might be possible that the
man's body was not in that lake at all. For, since evil-minded
people did occasionally desire to get rid of other people, might it
not be possible that that man had gone there with that girl in
order to get rid of her? A very smooth and devilish trick, of
course, but one which, in this instance at least, seemed to have
succeeded admirably.</p>

<p>But as for him accepting such an evil suggestion and acting upon
it...never! Yet here was his own problem growing hourly more
desperate, since every day, or at least every other day, brought
him either letters from Roberta or a note from Sondra&mdash;their
respective missives maintaining the same relative contrast between
ease and misery, gayety of mood and the somberness of defeat and
uncertainty.</p>

<p>To Roberta, since he would not write her, he was telephoning
briefly and in as non-committal a manner as possible. How was she?
He was so glad to hear from her and to know that she was out in the
country and at home, where it must be much nicer than in the
factory here in this weather. Everything was going smoothly, of
course, and except for a sudden rush of orders which made it rather
hard these last two days, all was as before. He was doing his best
to save a certain amount of money for a certain project about which
she knew, but otherwise he was not worrying about
anything&mdash;and she must not. He had not written before because
of the work, and could not write much&mdash;there were so many
things to do&mdash;but he missed seeing her in her old place, and
was looking forward to seeing her again soon. If she were coming
down toward Lycurgus as she said, and really thought it important
to see him, well, that could be arranged, maybe&mdash;but was it
necessary right now? He was so very busy and expected to see her
later, of course.</p>

<p>But at the same time he was writing Sondra that assuredly on the
eighteenth, and the week-end following, if possible, he would be
with her.</p>

<p>So, by virtue of such mental prestidigitation and
tergiversation, inspired and animated as it was by his desire for
Sondra, his inability to face the facts in connection with Roberta,
he achieved the much-coveted privilege of again seeing her, over
one week-end at least, and in such a setting as never before in his
life had he been privileged to witness.</p>

<p>For as he came down to the public dock at Sharon, adjoining the
veranda of the inn at the foot of Twelfth Lake, he was met by
Bertine and her brother as well as Sondra, who, in Grant's launch,
had motored down the Chain to pick him up. The bright blue waters
of the Indian Chain. The tall, dark, spear pines that sentineled
the shores on either side and gave to the waters at the west a band
of black shadow where the trees were mirrored so clearly. The small
and large, white and pink and green and brown lodges on every hand,
with their boathouses. Pavilions by the shore. An occasional
slender pier reaching out from some spacious and at times stately
summer lodge, such as those now owned by the Cranstons, Finchleys
and others. The green and blue canoes and launches. The gay hotel
and pavilion at Pine Point already smartly attended by the early
arrivals here! And then the pier and boathouse of the Cranston
Lodge itself, with two Russian wolfhounds recently acquired by
Bertine lying on the grass near the shore, apparently awaiting her
return, and a servant John, one of a half dozen who attended the
family here, waiting to take the single bag of Clyde, his tennis
racquet and golf sticks. But most of all he was impressed by the
large rambling and yet smartly-designed house, with its bright
geranium-bordered walks, its wide, brown, wicker-studded veranda
commanding a beautiful view of the lake; the cars and personalities
of the various guests, who in golf, tennis or lounging clothes were
to be seen idling here and there.</p>

<p>At Bertine's request, John at once showed him to a spacious room
overlooking the lake, where it was his privilege now to bathe and
change for tennis with Sondra, Bertine and Grant. After dinner, as
explained by Sondra, who was over at Bertine's for the occasion, he
was to come over with Bertine and Grant to the Casino, where he
would be introduced to such as all here knew. There was to be
dancing. To-morrow, in the morning early, before breakfast, if he
chose&mdash;he should ride with her and Bertine and Stuart along a
wonderful woodland trail through the forests to the west which led
to Inspiration Point and a more distant view of the lake. And, as
he now learned, except for a few such paths as this, the forest was
trackless for forty miles. Without a compass or guide, as he was
told, one might wander to one's death even&mdash;so evasive were
directions to those who did not know. And after breakfast and a
swim she and Bertine and Nina Temple would demonstrate their new
skill with Sondra's aquaplane. After that, lunch, tennis, or golf,
a trip to the Casino for tea. After dinner at the lodge of the
Brookshaws of Utica across the lake, there was to be dancing.</p>

<p>Within an hour after his arrival, as Clyde could see, the
program for the week-end was already full. But that he and Sondra
would contrive not only moments but possibly hours together he well
knew. And then he would see what new delight, in connection with
her many-faceted temperament, the wonderful occasion would provide.
To him, in spite of the dour burden of Roberta, which for this one
week-end at least he could lay aside, it was as though he were in
Paradise.</p>

<p>And on the tennis grounds of the Cranstons, it seemed as though
never before had Sondra, attired in a short, severe white tennis
skirt and blouse, with a yellow-and-green dotted handkerchief tied
about her hair, seemed so gay, graceful and happy. The smile that
was upon her lips! The gay, laughing light of promise that was in
her eyes whenever she glanced at him! And now and then, in running
to serve him, it was as though she were poised bird-like in
flight&mdash; her racquet arm high, a single toe seeming barely to
touch the ground, her head thrown back, her lips parted and smiling
always. And in calling twenty love, thirty love, forty love, it was
always with a laughing accent on the word love, which at once
thrilled and saddened him, as he saw, and rejoiced in from one
point of view, she was his to take, if only he were free to take
her now. But this other black barrier which he himself had
built!</p>

<p>And then this scene, where a bright sun poured a flood of
crystal light upon a greensward that stretched from tall pines to
the silver rippling waters of a lake. And off shore in a half dozen
different directions the bright white sails of small
boats&mdash;the white and green and yellow splashes of color, where
canoes paddled by idling lovers were passing in the sun!
Summertime&mdash;leisure&mdash;
warmth&mdash;color&mdash;ease&mdash;beauty&mdash;love&mdash;all
that he had dreamed of the summer before, when he was so very much
alone.</p>

<p>At moments it seemed to Clyde that he would reel from very joy
of the certain fulfillment of a great desire, that was all but
immediately within his control; at other times (the thought of
Roberta sweeping down upon him as an icy wind), as though nothing
could be more sad, terrible, numbing to the dreams of beauty, love
and happiness than this which now threatened him. That terrible
item about the lake and those two people drowned! The probability
that in spite of his wild plan within a week, or two or three at
most, he would have to leave all this forever. And then of a sudden
he would wake to realize that he was fumbling or playing
badly&mdash;that Bertine or Sondra or Grant was calling: "Oh,
Clyde, what are you thinking of, anyhow?" And from the darkest
depths of his heart he would have answered, had he spoken,
"Roberta."</p>

<p>At the Brookshaws', again that evening, a smart company of
friends of Sondra's, Bertine's and others. On the dance floor a
reencounter with Sondra, all smiles, for she was pretending for the
benefit of others here&mdash;her mother and father in
particular&mdash;that she had not seen Clyde before&mdash;did not
even know that he was here.</p>

<p>"You up here? That's great. Over at the Cranstons'? Oh, isn't
that dandy? Right next door to us. Well, we'll see a lot of each
other, what? How about a canter to-morrow before seven? Bertine and
I go nearly every day. And we'll have a picnic tomorrow, if nothing
interferes, canoeing and motoring. Don't worry about not riding
well. I'll get Bertine to let you have Jerry&mdash;he's just a
sheep. And you don't need to worry about togs, either. Grant has
scads of things. I'll dance the next two dances with others, but
you sit out the third one with me, will you? I know a peach of a
place outside on the balcony."</p>

<p>She was off with fingers extended but with a
"we-understand-each-other" look in her eye. And outside in the
shadow later she pulled his face to hers when no one was looking
and kissed him eagerly, and, before the evening was over, they had
managed, by strolling along a path which led away from the house
along the lake shore, to embrace under the moon.</p>

<p>"Sondra so glad Clydie here. Misses him so much." She smoothed
his hair as he kissed her, and Clyde, bethinking him of the shadow
which lay so darkly between them, crushed her feverishly,
desperately. "Oh, my darling baby girl," he exclaimed. "My
beautiful, beautiful Sondra! If you only knew how much I love you!
If you only knew! I wish I could tell you <i>all</i>. I wish I
could."</p>

<p>But he could not now&mdash;or ever. He would never dare to speak
to her of even so much as a phase of the black barrier that now lay
between them. For, with her training, the standards of love and
marriage that had been set for her, she would never understand,
never be willing to make so great a sacrifice for love, as much as
she loved him. And he would be left, abandoned on the instant, and
with what horror in her eyes!</p>

<p>Yet looking into his eyes, his face white and tense, and the
glow of the moon above making small white electric sparks in his
eyes, she exclaimed as he gripped her tightly: "Does he love Sondra
so much? Oh, sweetie boy! Sondra loves him, too." She seized his
head between her hands and held it tight, kissing him swiftly and
ardently a dozen times. "And Sondra won't give her Clydie up
either. She won't. You just wait and see! It doesn't matter what
happens now. It may not be so very easy, but she won't." Then as
suddenly and practically, as so often was her way, she exclaimed:
"But we must go now, right away. No, not another kiss now. No, no,
Sondra says no, now. They'll be missing us." And straightening up
and pulling him by the arm she hurried him back to the house in
time to meet Palmer Thurston, who was looking for her.</p>

<p>The next morning, true to her promise, there was the canter to
Inspiration Point, and that before seven&mdash;Bertine and Sondra
in bright red riding coats and white breeches and black boots,
their hair unbound and loose to the wind, and riding briskly on
before for the most part; then racing back to where he was. Or
Sondra halloing gayly for him to come on, or the two of them
laughing and chatting a hundred yards ahead in some concealed
chapel of the aisled trees where he could not see them. And because
of the interest which Sondra was so obviously manifesting in him
these days&mdash;an interest which Bertine herself had begun to
feel might end in marriage, if no family complications arose to
interfere&mdash;she, Bertine, was all smiles, the very soul of
cordiality, winsomely insisting that he should come up and stay for
the summer and she would chaperon them both so that no one would
have a chance to complain. And Clyde thrilling, and yet brooding
too&mdash;by turns&mdash; occasionally&mdash;and in spite of
himself drifting back to the thought that the item in the paper had
inspired&mdash;and yet fighting it&mdash; trying to shut it out
entirely.</p>

<p>And then at one point, Sondra, turning down a steep path which
led to a stony and moss-lipped spring between the dark trees,
called to Clyde to "Come on down. Jerry knows the way. He won't
slip. Come and get a drink. If you do, you'll come back again
soon&mdash;so they say."</p>

<p>And once he was down and had dismounted to drink, she exclaimed:
"I've been wanting to tell you something. You should have seen
Mamma's face last night when she heard you were up here. She can't
be sure that I had anything to do with it, of course, because she
thinks that Bertine likes you, too. I made her think that. But just
the same she suspects that I had a hand in it, I guess, and she
doesn't quite like it. But she can't say anything more than she has
before. And I had a talk with Bertine just now and she's agreed to
stick by me and help me all she can. But we'll have to be even more
careful than ever now, because I think if Mamma got too suspicious
I don't know what she might do&mdash;want us to leave here, even
now maybe, just so I couldn't see you. You know she feels that I
shouldn't be interested in any one yet except some one she likes.
You know how it is. She's that way with Stuart, too. But if you'll
take care not to show that you care for me so much whenever we're
around any one of our crowd, I don't think she'll do
anything&mdash;not now, anyhow. Later on, in the fall, when we're
back in Lycurgus, things will be different. I'll be of age then,
and I'm going to see what I can do. I never loved any one before,
but I do love you, and, well, I won't give you up, that's all. I
won't. And they can't make me, either!"</p>

<p>She stamped her foot and struck her boot, the while the two
horses looked idly and vacantly about. And Clyde, enthused and
astonished by this second definite declaration in his behalf, as
well as fired by the thought that now, if ever, he might suggest
the elopement and marriage and so rid himself of the sword that
hung so threateningly above him, now gazed at Sondra, his eyes
filled with a nervous hope and a nervous fear. For she might
refuse, and change, too, shocked by the suddenness of his
suggestion. And he had no money and no place in mind where they
might go either, in case she accepted his proposal. But she had,
perhaps, or she might have. And having once consented, might she
not help him? Of course. At any rate, he felt that he must speak,
leaving luck or ill luck to the future.</p>

<p>And so he said: "Why couldn't you run away with me now, Sondra,
darling? It's so long until fall and I want you so much. Why
couldn't we? Your mother's not likely to want to let you marry me
then, anyhow. But if we went away now, she couldn't help herself,
could she? And afterwards, in a few months or so, you could write
her and then she wouldn't mind. Why couldn't we, Sondra?" His voice
was very pleading, his eyes full of a sad dread of refusal&mdash;
and of the future that lay unprotected behind that.</p>

<p>And by now so caught was she by the tremor with which his mood
invested him, that she paused&mdash;not really shocked by the
suggestion at all&mdash;but decidedly moved, as well as flattered
by the thought that she was able to evoke in Clyde so eager and
headlong a passion. He was so impetuous&mdash;so blazing now with a
flame of her own creating, as she felt, yet which she was incapable
of feeling as much as he, as she knew&mdash;such a flame as she had
never seen in him or any one else before. And would it not be
wonderful if she could run away with him
now&mdash;secretly&mdash;to Canada or New York or Boston, or
anywhere? The excitement her elopement would create here and
elsewhere&mdash;in Lycurgus, Albany, Utica! The talk and feeling in
her own family as well as elsewhere! And Gilbert would be related
to her in spite of him&mdash;and the Griffiths, too, whom her
mother and father so much admired.</p>

<p>For a moment there was written in her eyes the desire and the
determination almost, to do as he suggested&mdash;run
away&mdash;make a great lark of this, her intense and true love.
For, once married, what could her parents do? And was not Clyde
worthy of her and them, too? Of course&mdash;even though nearly all
in her set fancied that he was not quite all he should be, just
because he didn't have as much money as they had. But he would
have&mdash;would he not&mdash;after he was married to her&mdash;and
get as good a place in her father's business as Gil Griffiths had
in his father's?</p>

<p>Yet a moment later, thinking of her life here and what her going
off in such a way would mean to her father and mother just
then&mdash;in the very beginning of the summer season&mdash;as well
as how it would disrupt her own plans and cause her mother to feel
especially angry, and perhaps even to bring about the dissolution
of the marriage on the ground that she was not of age, she
paused&mdash;that gay light of adventure replaced by a marked trace
of the practical and the material that so persistently
characterized her. What difference would a few months make, anyhow?
It might, and no doubt would, save Clyde from being separated from
her forever, whereas their present course might insure their
separation.</p>

<p>Accordingly she now shook her head in a certain, positive and
yet affectionate way, which by now Clyde had come to know spelled
defeat&mdash;the most painful and irremediable defeat that had yet
come to him in connection with all this. She would not go! Then he
was lost&mdash;lost&mdash;and she to him forever maybe. Oh, God!
For while her face softened with a tenderness which was not usually
there&mdash;even when she was most moved emotionally&mdash;she
said: "I would, honey, if I did not think it best not to, now. It's
too soon. Mamma isn't going to do anything right now. I know she
isn't. Besides she has made all her plans to do a lot of
entertaining here this summer, and for my particular benefit. She
wants me to be nice to&mdash;well, you know who I mean. And I can
be, without doing anything to interfere with us in any way, I'm
sure&mdash;so long as I don't do anything to really frighten her."
She paused to smile a reassuring smile. "But you can come up here
as often as you choose, don't you see, and she and these others
won't think anything of it, because you won't be our guest, don't
you see? I've fixed all that with Bertine. And that means that we
can see each other all summer long up here, just about as much as
we want to, don't you see? Then in the fall, when I come back, and
if I find that I can't make her be nice to you at all, or consider
our being engaged, why, I will run away with you. Yes, I will,
darling&mdash;really and truly."</p>

<p>Darling! The fall!</p>

<p>She stopped, her eyes showing a very shrewd conception of all
the practical difficulties before them, while she took both of his
hands in hers and looked up into his face. Then, impulsively and
conclusively, she threw both arms about his neck and, pulling his
head down, kissed him.</p>

<p>"Can't you see, dearie? Please don't look so sad, darling.
Sondra loves her Clyde so much. And she'll do anything and
everything to make things come out right. Yes, she will. And they
will, too. Now you wait and see. She won't give him up
ever&mdash;ever!"</p>

<p>And Clyde, realizing that he had not one moving argument
wherewith to confront her, really&mdash;not one that might not
cause her to think strangely and suspiciously of his intense
anxiety, and that this, because of Roberta's demand, and
unless&mdash;unless&mdash;well&mdash;, unless Roberta let him go it
all spelled defeat for him, now looked gloomily and even
desperately upon her face. The beauty of her! The completeness of
this world! And yet not to be allowed to possess her or it, ever.
And Roberta with her demand and his promise in the immediate
background! And no way of escape save by flight! God!</p>

<p>At this point it was that a nervous and almost deranged
look&mdash;never so definite or powerful at any time before in his
life&mdash;the border-line look between reason and unreason, no
less&mdash;so powerful that the quality of it was even noticeable
to Sondra&mdash;came into his eyes. He looked sick, broken,
unbelievably despairing. So much so that she exclaimed, "Why, what
is it, Clyde, dearie&mdash;you look so&mdash; oh, I can't say just
how&mdash;forlorn or&mdash;Does he love me so much? And can't he
wait just three or four months? But, oh, yes he can, too. It isn't
as bad as he thinks. He'll be with me most of the time&mdash;the
lovekins will. And when he isn't, Sondra'll write him every
day&mdash;every day."</p>

<p>"But, Sondra! Sondra! If I could just tell you. If you knew how
much it were going to mean to me&mdash;"</p>

<p>He paused here, for as he could see at this point, into the
expression of Sondra came a practical inquiry as to what it was
that made it so urgent for her to leave with him at once. And
immediately, on his part, Clyde sensing how enormous was the hold
of this world on her&mdash;how integral a part of it she
was&mdash;and how, by merely too much insistence here and now, he
might so easily cause her to doubt the wisdom of her primary craze
for him, was moved to desist, sure that if he spoke it would lead
her to questioning him in such a way as might cause her to
change&mdash;or at least to modify her enthusiasm to the point
where even the dream of the fall might vanish.</p>

<p>And so, instead of explaining further why he needed a decision
on her part, he merely desisted, saying: "It's because I need you
so much now, dear&mdash;all of the time. That's it, just that. It
seems at times as though I could never be away from you another
minute any more. Oh, I'm so hungry for you all of the time."</p>

<p>And yet Sondra, flattered as she was by this hunger, and
reciprocating it in part at least, merely repeated the various
things she had said before. They must wait. All would come out all
right in the fall. And Clyde, quite numb because of his defeat, yet
unable to forego or deny the delight of being with her now, did his
best to recover his mood&mdash;and think, think, think that in some
way&mdash;somehow&mdash;maybe via that plan of that boat or in some
other way!</p>

<p>But what other way?</p>

<p>But no, no, no&mdash;not that. He was not a murderer and never
could be. He was not a
murderer&mdash;never&mdash;never&mdash;never.</p>

<p>And yet this loss.</p>

<p>This impending disaster.</p>

<p>This impending disaster.</p>

<p>How to avoid that and win to Sondra after all.</p>

<p>How, how, how?</p>

<h3>Chapter 44</h3>

<p>And then on his return to Lycurgus early Monday morning, the
following letter from Roberta,</p>

<blockquote>DEAR CLYDE:<br>
<br>
My dear, I have often heard the saying, "it never rains but it
pours," but I never knew what it meant until to-day. About the
first person I saw this morning was Mr. Wilcox, a neighbor of ours,
who came to say that Mrs. Anse would not be out today on account of
some work she had to do for Mrs. Dinwiddie in Biltz, although when
she left yesterday everything had been prepared for her so that I
could help her a little with the sewing and so hurry things up a
bit. And now she won't be here until tomorrow. Next word came that
Mother's sister, Mrs. Nichols, is very ill and Mother had to go
over to her house at Baker's Pond, which is about twelve miles east
of here, Tom driving her, although he ought to be here to help
father with all the work that there is to do about the farm. And I
don't know if Mother will be able to get back before Sunday. If I
were better and didn't have all this work of my own on my hands I
would have to go too, I suppose, although Mother insists not.<br>
<br>
Next, Emily and Tom, thinking all is going so well with me and that
I might enjoy it, were having four girls and four boys come here
tonight for a sort of June moon-party, with ice cream and cake to
be made by Emily and Mother and myself. But now, poor dear, she has
to do a lot of telephoning over Mr. Wilcox's phone, which we share,
in order to put it off until some day next week, if possible. And
she's just heartsick and gloomy, of course.<br>
<br>
As for myself, I'm trying to keep a stiff upper lip, as the saying
is. But it's pretty hard, dear, I'll tell you. For so far I have
only had three small telephone talks with you, saying that you
didn't think you would have the necessary money before July fifth.
And to put the finishing touches on it, as I only learned to-day,
Mamma and Papa have about decided to go to my Uncle Charlie's in
Hamilton for over the fourth (from the fourth to the fifteenth) and
take me with them, unless I decide to return to Lycurgus, while Tom
and Emily visit with my sister at Homer. But, dear, I can't do
that, as you know. I'm too sick and worried. Last night I vomited
dreadful and have been half dead on my feet all day, and I am just
about crazy tonight. Dear, what can we do? Can't you come for me
before July third, which will be the time they will be going? You
will have to come for me before then, really, because I just can't
go up there with them. It's fifty miles from here. I could say I
would go up there with them if only you would be sure to come for
me before they start. But I must be absolutely sure that you are
coming&mdash;absolutely.<br>
<br>
Clyde, I have done nothing but cry since I got here. If you were
only here I wouldn't feel so badly. I do try to be brave, dear, but
how can I help thinking at times that you will never come for me
when you haven't written me one single note and have only talked to
me three times since I've been up here. But then I say to myself
you couldn't be so mean as that, and especially since you have
promised. Oh, you will come, won't you? Everything worries me so
now, Clyde, for some reason and I'm so frightened, dear. I think of
last summer and then this one, and all my dreams. It won't make any
real difference to you about your coming a few days sooner than you
intended, will it, dear? Even if we have to get along on a little
less. I know that we can. I can be very saving and economical. I
will try to have my dresses made by then. If not, I will do with
what I have and finish them later. And I will try and be brave,
dear, and not annoy you much, if only you will come. You must, you
know, Clyde. It can't be any other way, although for your sake now
I wish it could.<br>
<br>
Please, please, Clyde, write and tell me that you will be here at
the end of the time that you said. I worry so and get so lonesome
off here all by myself. I will come straight back to you if you
don't come by the time you said. I know you will not like me to say
this, but, Clyde, I can't stay here and that's all there is to it.
And I can't go away with Mamma and Papa either, so there is only
one way out. I don't believe I will sleep a wink to-night, so
please write me and in your letter tell me over and over not to
worry about your not coming for me. If you could only come to-day,
dear, or this week-end, I wouldn't feel so blue. But nearly two
weeks more! Every one is in bed and the house is still, so I will
stop.<br>
<br>
But please write me, dear, right away, or if you won't do that call
me up sure to-morrow, because I just can't rest one single minute
until I do hear from you.<br>
<br>
Your miserable ROBERTA.<br>
<br>
P. S.: This is a horrid letter, but I just can't write a better
one. I'm so blue.</blockquote>

<p>But the day this letter arrived in Lycurgus Clyde was not there
to answer it at once. And because of that, Roberta being in the
darkest and most hysterical mood and thought, sat down on Saturday
afternoon and, half-convinced as she was that he might already have
departed for some distant point without any word to her, almost
shrieked or screamed, if one were to properly characterize the mood
that animated the following:</p>

<blockquote>Biltz, Saturday, June 14th.<br>
<br>
MY DEAR CLYDE:<br>
<br>
I am writing to tell you that I am coming back to Lycurgus. I
simply can't stay here any longer. Mamma worries and wonders why I
cry so much, and I am just about sick. I know I promised to stay
until the 25th or 26th, but then you said you would write me, but
you never have&mdash;only an occasional telephone message when I am
almost crazy. I woke up this morning and couldn't help crying right
away and this afternoon my headache is dreadful.<br>
<br>
I'm so afraid you won't come and I'm so frightened, dear. Please
come and take me away some place, anywhere, so I can get out of
here and not worry like I do. I'm so afraid in the state that I'm
in that Papa and Mamma may make me tell the whole affair or that
they will find it out for themselves.<br>
<br>
Oh, Clyde, you will never know. You have said you would come, and
sometimes I just know you will. But at other times I get to
thinking about other things and I'm just as certain you won't,
especially when you don't write or telephone. I wish you would
write and say that you will come just so I can stand to stay here.
Just as soon as you get this, I wish you would write me and tell me
the exact day you can come&mdash;not later than the first, really,
because I know I cannot stand to stay here any longer than then.
Clyde, there isn't a girl in the whole world as miserable as I am,
and you have made me so. But I don't mean that, either, dear. You
were good to me once, and you are now, offering to come for me. And
if you will come right away I will be so grateful. And when you
read this, if you think I am unreasonable, please do not mind it,
Clyde, but just think I am crazy with grief and worry and that I
just don't know what to do. Please write me, Clyde. If you only
knew how I need a word.<br>
<br>
ROBERTA.</blockquote>

<p>This letter, coupled as it was with a threat to come to
Lycurgus, was sufficient to induce in Clyde a state not unlike
Roberta's. To think that he had no additional, let alone plausible,
excuse to offer Roberta whereby she could be induced to delay her
final and imperative demand. He racked his brains. He must not
write her any long and self-incriminating letters. That would be
foolish in the face of his determination not to marry her. Besides
his mood at the moment, so fresh from the arms and kisses of
Sondra, was not for anything like that. He could not, even if he
would.</p>

<p>At the same time, something must be done at once, as he could
see, in order to allay her apparently desperate mood. And ten
minutes after he had finished reading the last of these two
letters, he was attempting to reach Roberta over the telephone. And
finally getting her after a troublesome and impatient half-hour, he
heard her voice, thin and rather querulous as it seemed to him at
first, but really only because of a poor connection, saying:
"Hello, Clyde, hello. Oh, I'm so glad you called. I've been
terribly nervous. Did you get my two letters? I was just about to
leave here in the morning if I didn't hear from you by then. I just
couldn't stand not to hear anything. Where have you been, dear? Did
you read what I said about my parents going away? That's true. Why
don't you write, Clyde, or call me up anyhow? What about what I
said in my letter about the third? Will you be sure and come then?
Or shall I meet you somewhere? I've been so nervous the last three
or four days, but now that I hear you again, maybe I'll be able to
quiet down some. But I do wish you would write me a note every few
days anyhow. Why won't you, Clyde? You haven't even written me one
since I've been here. I can't tell you what a state I'm in and how
hard it is to keep calm now."</p>

<p>Plainly Roberta was very nervous and fearsome as she talked. As
a matter of fact, except that the home in which she was telephoning
was deserted at the moment she was talking very indiscreetly, it
seemed to Clyde. And it aided but little in his judgment for her to
explain that she was all alone and that no one could hear her. He
did not want her to use his name or refer to letters written to
him.</p>

<p>Without talking too plainly, he now tried to make it clear that
he was very busy and that it was hard for him to write as much as
she might think necessary. Had he not said that he was coming on
the 28th or thereabouts if he could? Well, he would if he could,
only it looked now as though it might be necessary for him to
postpone it for another week or so, until the seventh or eighth of
July&mdash; long enough for him to get together an extra fifty for
which he had a plan, and which would be necessary for him to have.
But really, which was the thought behind this other, long enough
for him to pay one more visit to Sondra as he was yearning to do,
over the next week-end. But this demand of hers, now! Couldn't she
go with her parents for a week or so and then let him come for her
there or she come to him? It would give him more needed time,
and&mdash;</p>

<p>But at this Roberta, bursting forth in a storm of nervous
disapproval&mdash;saying that most certainly if that were the case
she was going back to her room at the Gilpins', if she could get
it, and not waste her time up there getting ready and waiting for
him when he was not coming&mdash;he suddenly decided that he might
as well say that he was coming on the third, or that if he did not,
that at least by then he would have arranged with her where to meet
him. For even by now, he had not made up his mind as to how he was
to do. He must have a little more time to think&mdash;more time to
think.</p>

<p>And so now he altered his tone greatly and said: "But listen,
Bert. Please don't be angry with me. You talk as though I didn't
have any troubles in connection with all this, either. You don't
know what this may be going to cost me before I'm through with it,
and you don't seem to care much. I know you're worried and all
that, but what about me? I'm doing the very best I can now, Bert,
with all I have to think about. And won't you just be patient now
until the third, anyhow? Please do. I promise to write you and if I
don't, I'll call you up every other day. Will that be all right?
But I certainly don't want you to be using my name like you did a
while ago. That will lead to trouble, sure. Please don't. And when
I call again, I'll just say it's Mr. Baker asking, see, and you can
say it's any one you like afterwards. And then, if by any chance
anything should come up that would stop our starting exactly on the
third, why you can come back here if you want to, see, or somewhere
near here, and then we can start as soon as possible after
that."</p>

<p>His tone was so pleading and soothing, infused as it
was&mdash;but because of his present necessity only with a trace of
that old tenderness and seeming helplessness which, at times, had
quite captivated Roberta, that even now it served to win her to a
bizarre and groundless gratitude. So much so that at once she had
replied, warmly and emotionally, even: "Oh, no, dear. I don't want
to do anything like that. You know I don't. It's just because
things are so bad as they are with me and I can't help myself now.
You know that, Clyde, don't you? I can't help loving you. I always
will, I suppose. And I don't want to do anything to hurt you, dear,
really I don't if I can help it."</p>

<p>And Clyde, hearing the ring of genuine affection, and sensing
anew his old-time power over her, was disposed to reenact the role
of lover again, if only in order to dissuade Roberta from being too
harsh and driving with him now. For while he could not like her
now, he told himself, and could not think of marrying her, still in
view of this other dream he could at least be gracious to
her&mdash; could he not?&mdash;Pretend! And so this conversation
ended with a new peace based on this agreement.<br>
<br></p>

<p>The preceding day&mdash;a day of somewhat reduced activities on
the lakes from which he had just returned&mdash;he and Sondra and
Stuart and Bertine, together with Nina Temple and a youth named
Harley Baggott, then visiting the Thurstons, had motored first from
Twelfth Lake to Three Mile Bay, a small lakeside resort some
twenty-five miles north, and from thence, between towering walls of
pines, to Big Bittern and some other smaller lakes lost in the
recesses of the tall pines of the region to the north of Trine
Lake. And en route, Clyde, as he now recalled, had been most
strangely impressed at moments and in spots by the desolate and for
the most part lonely character of the region. The narrow and
rain-washed and even rutted nature of the dirt roads that wound
between tall, silent and darksome trees&mdash;forests in the
largest sense of the word&mdash;that extended for miles and miles
apparently on either hand. The decadent and weird nature of some of
the bogs and tarns on either side of the only comparatively
passable dirt roads which here and there were festooned with
funereal or viperous vines, and strewn like deserted battlefields
with soggy and decayed piles of fallen and crisscrossed
logs&mdash;in places as many as four deep&mdash;one above the
other&mdash;in the green slime that an undrained depression in the
earth had accumulated. The eyes and backs of occasional frogs that,
upon lichen or vine or moss-covered stumps and rotting logs in this
warm June weather, there sunned themselves apparently undisturbed;
the spirals of gnats, the solitary flick of a snake's tail as
disturbed by the sudden approach of the machine, one made off into
the muck and the poisonous grasses and water-plants which were
thickly imbedded in it.</p>

<p>And in seeing one of these Clyde, for some reason, had thought
of the accident at Pass Lake. He did not realize it, but at the
moment his own subconscious need was contemplating the loneliness
and the usefulness at times of such a lone spot as this. And at one
point it was that a wier-wier, one of the solitary water-birds of
this region, uttered its ouphe and barghest cry, flying from
somewhere near into some darker recess within the woods. And at
this sound it was that Clyde had stirred nervously and then sat up
in the car. It was so very different to any bird-cry he had ever
heard anywhere.</p>

<p>"What was that?" he asked of Harley Baggott, who sat next
him.</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Why, that bird or something that just flew away back there just
now?"</p>

<p>"I didn't hear any bird."</p>

<p>"Gee! That was a queer sound. It makes me feel creepy."</p>

<p>As interesting and impressive as anything else to him in this
almost tenantless region had been the fact that there were so many
lonesome lakes, not one of which he had ever heard of before. The
territory through which they were speeding as fast as the dirt
roads would permit, was dotted with them in these deep forests of
pine. And only occasionally in passing near one, were there any
signs indicating a camp or lodge, and those to be reached only by
some half-blazed trail or rutty or sandy road disappearing through
darker trees. In the main, the shores of the more remote lakes
passed, were all but untenanted, or so sparsely that a cabin or a
distant lodge to be seen across the smooth waters of some
pine-encircled gem was an object of interest to all.</p>

<p>Why must he think of that other lake in Massachusetts! That
boat! The body of that girl found&mdash;but not that of the man who
accompanied her! How terrible, really!</p>

<p>He recalled afterwards,&mdash;here in his room, after the last
conversation with Roberta&mdash;that the car, after a few more
miles, had finally swung into an open space at the north end of a
long narrow lake&mdash;the south prospect of which appeared to be
divided by a point or an island suggesting a greater length and
further windings or curves than were visible from where the car had
stopped. And except for the small lodge and boathouse at this upper
end it had appeared so very lonesome&mdash;not a launch or canoe on
it at the time their party arrived. And as in the case of all the
other lakes seen this day, the banks to the very shore line were
sentineled with those same green pines&mdash;tall,
spear-shaped&mdash; their arms widespread like one outside his
window here in Lycurgus. And beyond them in the distance, to the
south and west, rose the humped and still smooth and green backs of
the nearer Adirondacks. And the water before them, now ruffled by a
light wind and glowing in the afternoon sun, was of an intense
Prussian blue, almost black, which suggested, as was afterwards
confirmed by a guide who was lounging upon the low veranda of the
small inn&mdash;that it was very deep&mdash;"all of seventy feet
not more than a hundred feet out from that boathouse."</p>

<p>And at this point Harley Baggott, who was interested to learn
more about the fishing possibilities of this lake in behalf of his
father, who contemplated coming to this region in a few days, had
inquired of the guide who appeared not to look at the others in the
car:</p>

<p>"How long is this lake, anyhow?"</p>

<p>"Oh, about seven miles."</p>

<p>"Any fish in it?"</p>

<p>"Throw a line in and see. The best place for black bass and the
like of that almost anywhere around here. Off the island down
yonder, or just to the south of it round on the other side there,
there's a little bay that's said to be one of the best fishin'
holes in any of the lakes up this way. I've seen a coupla men bring
back as many as seventy-five fish in two hours. That oughta satisfy
anybody that ain't tryin' to ruin the place for the rest of
us."</p>

<p>The guide, a thinnish, tall and wizened type, with a long,
narrow head and small, keen, bright blue eyes laughed a yokelish
laugh as he studied the group. "Not thinkin' of tryin' your luck
to-day?"</p>

<p>"No, just inquiring for my dad. He's coming up here next week,
maybe. I want to see about accommodations."</p>

<p>"Well, they ain't what they are down to Racquette, of course,
but then the fish down there ain't what they are up here, either."
He visited all with a sly and wry and knowing smile.</p>

<p>Clyde had never seen the type before. He was interested by all
the anomalies and contrarities of this lonesome world as contrasted
with cities he had known almost exclusively, as well as the
decidedly exotic and material life and equipment with which, at the
Cranstons' and elsewhere, he was then surrounded. The strange and
comparatively deserted nature of this region as contrasted with the
brisk and vigorous life of Lycurgus, less than a hundred miles to
the south.</p>

<p>"The country up here kills me," commented Stuart Finchley at
this point. "It's so near the Chain and yet it's so different,
scarcely any one living up here at all, it seems."</p>

<p>"Well, except for the camps in summer and the fellows that come
up to hunt moose and deer in the fall, there ain't much of anybody
or anything around here after September first," commented the
guide. "I've been guidin' and trappin' for nigh onto seventeen
years now around here and 'cept for more and more people around
some of the lakes below here&mdash;the Chain principally in
summer&mdash;I ain't seen much change. You need to know this
country purty well if yer goin't strike out anywhere away from the
main roads, though o' course about five miles to the west o' here
is the railroad. Gun Lodge is the station. We bring 'em by bus from
there in the summer. And from the south end down there is a sorta
road leadin' down to Greys Lake and Three Mile Bay. You musta come
along a part of it, since it's the only road up into this country
as yet. They're talkin' of cuttin' one through to Long Lake
sometime, but so far it's mostly talk. But from most of these other
lakes around here, there's no road at all, not that an automobile
could make. Just trails and there's not even a decent camp on some
o' 'em. You have to bring your own outfit. But Ellis and me was
over to Gun Lake last summer&mdash;that's thirty miles west o' here
and we had to walk every inch of the way and carry our packs. But,
oh, say, the fishin' and moose and deer come right down to the
shore in places to drink. See 'em as plain as that stump across the
lake."</p>

<p>And Clyde remembered that, along with the others, he had carried
away the impression that for solitude and charm&mdash;or at least
mystery&mdash;this region could scarcely be matched. And to think
it was all so comparatively near Lycurgus&mdash;not more than a
hundred miles by road; not more than seventy by rail, as he
eventually came to know.</p>

<p>But now once more in Lycurgus and back in his room after just
explaining to Roberta, as he had, he once more encountered on his
writing desk, the identical paper containing the item concerning
the tragedy at Pass Lake. And in spite of himself, his eye once
more followed nervously and yet unwaveringly to the last word all
the suggestive and provocative details. The uncomplicated and
apparently easy way in which the lost couple had first arrived at
the boathouse; the commonplace and entirely unsuspicious way in
which they had hired a boat and set forth for a row; the manner in
which they had disappeared to the north end; and then the upturned
boat, the floating oars and hats near the shore. He stood reading
in the still strong evening light. Outside the windows were the
dark boughs of the fir tree of which he had thought the preceding
day and which now suggested all those firs and pines about the
shores of Big Bittern.</p>

<p>But, good God! What was he thinking of anyhow? He, Clyde
Griffiths! The nephew of Samuel Griffiths! What was "getting into"
him? Murder! That's what it was. This terrible item&mdash;this
devil's accident or machination that was constantly putting it
before him! A most horrible crime, and one for which they
electrocuted people if they were caught. Besides, he could not
murder anybody&mdash;not Roberta, anyhow. Oh, no! Surely not after
all that had been between them. And yet&mdash;this other
world!&mdash;Sondra&mdash; which he was certain to lose now unless
he acted in some way&mdash;</p>

<p>His hands shook, his eyelids twitched&mdash;then his hair at the
roots tingled and over his body ran chill nervous titillations in
waves. Murder! Or upsetting a boat at any rate in deep water, which
of course might happen anywhere, and by accident, as at Pass Lake.
And Roberta could not swim. He knew that. But she might save
herself at that&mdash;scream&mdash;cling to the boat&mdash;and
then&mdash;if there were any to hear&mdash;and she told afterwards!
An icy perspiration now sprang to his forehead; his lips trembled
and suddenly his throat felt parched and dry. To prevent a thing
like that he would have to&mdash;to&mdash;but no&mdash;he was not
like that. He could not do a thing like that&mdash;hit any
one&mdash;a girl&mdash;Roberta&mdash;and when drowning or
struggling. Oh, no, no&mdash;no such thing as that! Impossible.</p>

<p>He took his straw hat and went out, almost before any one heard
him <i>think</i>, as he would have phrased it to himself, such
horrible, terrible thoughts. He could not and would not think them
from now on. He was no such person. And yet&mdash;and
yet&mdash;these thoughts. The solution&mdash;if he wanted one. The
way to stay here&mdash;not leave&mdash;marry Sondra&mdash;be rid of
Roberta and all&mdash;all&mdash;for the price of a little courage
or daring. But no!</p>

<p>He walked and walked&mdash;away from Lycurgus&mdash;out on a
road to the southeast which passed through a poor and decidedly
unfrequented rural section, and so left him alone to
think&mdash;or, as he felt, not to be heard in his thinking.</p>

<p>Day was fading into dark. Lamps were beginning to glow in the
cottages here and there. Trees in groups in fields or along the
road were beginning to blur or smokily blend. And although it was
warm&mdash;the air lifeless and lethargic&mdash;he walked fast,
thinking, and perspiring as he did so, as though he were seeking to
outwalk and outthink or divert some inner self that preferred to be
still and think.</p>

<p>That gloomy, lonely lake up there!</p>

<p>That island to the south!</p>

<p>Who would see?</p>

<p>Who could hear?</p>

<p>That station at Gun Lodge with a bus running to it at this
season of the year. (Ah, he remembered that, did he? The deuce!) A
terrible thing, to remember a thing like that in connection with
such a thought as this! But if he were going to think of such a
thing as this at all, he had better think well&mdash;he could tell
himself that&mdash;or stop thinking about it now&mdash;once and
forever&mdash; forever. But Sondra! Roberta! If ever he were
caught&mdash; electrocuted! And yet the actual misery of his
present state. The difficulty! The danger of losing Sondra. And
yet, murder&mdash;</p>

<p>He wiped his hot and wet face, and paused and gazed at a group
of trees across a field which somehow reminded him of the trees
of...well...he didn't like this road. It was getting too dark out
here. He had better turn and go back. But that road at the south
and leading to Three Mile Bay and Greys Lake&mdash;if one chose to
go that way&mdash;to Sharon and the Cranston Lodge&mdash;whither he
would be going afterwards if he did go that way. God! Big
Bittern&mdash;the trees along there after dark would be like
that&mdash;blurred and gloomy. It would have to be toward evening,
of course. No one would think of trying to...well...in the morning,
when there was so much light. Only a fool would do that. But at
night, toward dusk, as it was now, or a little later. But, damn it,
he would not listen to such thoughts. Yet no one would be likely to
see him or Roberta either&mdash;would they&mdash;there? It would be
so easy to go to a place like Big Bittern&mdash;for an alleged
wedding trip&mdash; would it not&mdash;over the Fourth,
say&mdash;or after the fourth or fifth, when there would be fewer
people. And to register as some one else&mdash;not himself&mdash;so
that he could never be traced that way. And then, again, it would
be so easy to get back to Sharon and the Cranstons' by midnight, or
the morning of the next day, maybe, and then, once there he could
pretend also that he had come north on that early morning train
that arrived about ten o'clock. And then...</p>

<p>Confound it&mdash;why should his mind keep dwelling on this
idea? Was he actually planning to do a thing like this? But he was
not! He could not be! He, Clyde Griffiths, could not be serious
about a thing like this. That was not possible. He could not be. Of
course! It was all too impossible, too wicked, to imagine that he,
Clyde Griffiths, could bring himself to execute a deed like that.
And yet...</p>

<p>And forthwith an uncanny feeling of wretchedness and
insufficiency for so dark a crime insisted on thrusting itself
forward. He decided to retrace his steps toward Lycurgus, where at
least he could be among people.</p>

<h3>Chapter 45</h3>

<p>There are moments when in connection with the sensitively
imaginative or morbidly anachronistic&mdash;the mentality assailed
and the same not of any great strength and the problem confronting
it of sufficient force and complexity&mdash;the reason not actually
toppling from its throne, still totters or is warped or
shaken&mdash;the mind befuddled to the extent that for the time
being, at least, unreason or disorder and mistaken or erroneous
counsel would appear to hold against all else. In such instances
the will and the courage confronted by some great difficulty which
it can neither master nor endure, appears in some to recede in
precipitate flight, leaving only panic and temporary unreason in
its wake.</p>

<p>And in this instance, the mind of Clyde might well have been
compared to a small and routed army in full flight before a major
one, yet at various times in its precipitate departure, pausing for
a moment to meditate on some way of escaping complete destruction
and in the coincident panic of such a state, resorting to the
weirdest and most haphazard of schemes of escaping from an
impending and yet wholly unescapable fate. The strained and
bedeviled look in his eyes at moments&mdash;the manner in which,
from moment to moment and hour to hour, he went over and over his
hitherto poorly balanced actions and thoughts but with no smallest
door of escape anywhere. And yet again at moments the solution
suggested by the item in The Times-Union again thrusting itself
forward, psychogenetically, born of his own turbulent, eager and
disappointed seeking. And hence persisting.</p>

<p>Indeed, it was now as though from the depths of some lower or
higher world never before guessed or plumbed by him...a region
otherwhere than in life or death and peopled by creatures otherwise
than himself...there had now suddenly appeared, as the genie at the
accidental rubbing of Aladdin's lamp&mdash;as the efrit emerging as
smoke from the mystic jar in the net of the fisherman&mdash;the
very substance of some leering and diabolic wish or wisdom
concealed in his own nature, and that now abhorrent and yet
compelling, leering and yet intriguing, friendly and yet cruel,
offered him a choice between an evil which threatened to destroy
him (and against his deepest opposition) and a second evil which,
however it might disgust or sear or terrify, still provided for
freedom and success and love.</p>

<p>Indeed the center or mentating section of his brain at this time
might well have been compared to a sealed and silent hall in which
alone and undisturbed, and that in spite of himself, he now sat
thinking on the mystic or evil and terrifying desires or advice of
some darker or primordial and unregenerate nature of his own, and
without the power to drive the same forth or himself to decamp, and
yet also without the courage to act upon anything.</p>

<p>For now the genie of his darkest and weakest side was speaking.
And it said: "And would you escape from the demands of Roberta that
but now and unto this hour have appeared unescapable to you?
Behold! I bring you a way. It is the way of the lake&mdash;Pass
Lake. This item that you have read&mdash;do you think it was placed
in your hands for nothing? Remember Big Bittern, the deep,
blue-black water, the island to the south, the lone road to Three
Mile Bay? How suitable to your needs! A row-boat or a canoe upset
in such a lake and Roberta would pass forever from your life. She
cannot swim! The lake&mdash;the lake&mdash;that you have
seen&mdash;that I have shown you&mdash;is it not ideal for the
purpose? So removed and so little frequented and yet comparatively
near&mdash;but a hundred miles from here. And how easy for you and
Roberta to go there&mdash;not directly but indirectly&mdash;on this
purely imaginative marriage-trip that you have already agreed to.
And all that you need do now is to change your name&mdash;and
hers&mdash;or let her keep her own and you use yours. You have
never permitted her to speak of you and this relationship, and she
never has. You have written her but formal notes. And now if you
should meet her somewhere as you have already agreed to, and
without any one seeing you, you might travel with her, as in the
past to Fonda, to Big Bittern&mdash;or some point near there."</p>

<p>"But there is no hotel at Big Bittern," at once corrected Clyde.
"A mere shack that entertains but few people and that not very
well."</p>

<p>"All the better. The less people are likely to be there."</p>

<p>"But we might be seen on the train going up together. I would be
identified as having been with her."</p>

<p>"Were you seen at Fonda, Gloversville, Little Falls? Have you
not ridden in separate cars or seats before and could you not do so
now? Is it not presumably to be a secret marriage? Then why not a
secret honeymoon?"</p>

<p>"True enough&mdash;true enough."</p>

<p>"And once you have arranged for that and arrive at Big Bittern
or some lake like it&mdash;there are so many there&mdash;how easy
to row out on such a lake? No questions. No registry under your own
name or hers. A boat rented for an hour or half-day or day. You saw
the island far to the south on that lone lake. Is it not beautiful?
It is well worth seeing. Why should you not go there on such a
pleasure trip before marriage? Would she not be happy so to
do&mdash;as weary and distressed as she is now&mdash;an
outing&mdash;a rest before the ordeal of the new life? Is not that
sensible&mdash;plausible? And neither of you will ever return
presumably. You will both be drowned, will you not? Who is to see?
A guide or two&mdash;the man who rents you the boat&mdash;the
innkeeper once, as you go. But how are they to know who you are? Or
who she is? And you heard the depth of the water."</p>

<p>"But I do not want to kill her. I do not want to kill her. I do
not want to injure her in any way. If she will but let me go and
she go her own way, I will be so glad and so happy never to see her
more."</p>

<p>"But she will not let you go or go her way unless you accompany
her. And if you go yours, it will be without Sondra and all that
she represents, as well as all this pleasant life here&mdash;your
standing with your uncle, his friends, their cars, the dances,
visits to the lodges on the lakes. And what then? A small job!
Small pay! Another such period of wandering as followed that
accident at Kansas City. Never another chance like this anywhere.
Do you prefer that?"</p>

<p>"But might there not be some accident here, destroying all my
dreams&mdash;my future&mdash;as there was in Kansas City?"</p>

<p>"An accident, to be sure&mdash;but not the same. In this
instance the plan is in your hands. You can arrange it all as you
will. And how easy! So many boats upsetting every summer&mdash;the
occupants of them drowning, because in most cases they cannot swim.
And will it ever be known whether the man who was with Roberta
Alden on Big Bittern could swim? And of all deaths, drowning is the
easiest&mdash;no noise&mdash;no outcry&mdash;perhaps the accidental
blow of an oar&mdash;the side of a boat. And then silence!
Freedom&mdash;a body that no one may ever find. Or if found and
identified, will it not be easy, if you but trouble to plan, to
make it appear that you were elsewhere, visiting at one of the
other lakes before you decided to go to Twelfth Lake. What is wrong
with it? Where is the flaw?"</p>

<p>"But assuming that I should upset the boat and that she should
not drown, then what? Should cling to it, cry out, be saved and
relate afterward that...But no, I cannot do that&mdash;will not do
it. I will not hit her. That would be too terrible...too vile."</p>

<p>"But a little blow&mdash;any little blow under such
circumstances would be sufficient to confuse and complete her
undoing. Sad, yes, but she has an opportunity to go her own way,
has she not? And she will not, nor let you go yours. Well, then, is
this so terribly unfair? And do not forget that afterwards there is
Sondra&mdash;the beautiful&mdash;a home with her in
Lycurgus&mdash;wealth, a high position such as elsewhere you may
never obtain again&mdash;never&mdash;never. Love and
happiness&mdash;the equal of any one here&mdash;superior even to
your cousin Gilbert."</p>

<p>The voice ceased temporarily, trailing off into
shadow,&mdash;silence, dreams.</p>

<p>And Clyde, contemplating all that had been said, was still
unconvinced. Darker fears or better impulses supplanted the counsel
of the voice in the great hall. But presently thinking of Sondra
and all that she represented, and then of Roberta, the dark
personality would as suddenly and swiftly return and with amplified
suavity and subtlety.</p>

<p>"Ah, still thinking on the matter. And you have not found a way
out and you will not. I have truly pointed out to you and in all
helpfulness the only way&mdash;the only way&mdash;It is a long
lake. And would it not be easy in rowing about to eventually find
some secluded spot&mdash;some invisible nook near that south shore
where the water is deep? And from there how easy to walk through
the woods to Three Mile Bay and Upper Greys Lake? And from there to
the Cranstons'? There is a boat from there, as you know.
Pah&mdash;how cowardly&mdash;how lacking in courage to win the
thing that above all things you
desire&mdash;beauty&mdash;wealth&mdash;position&mdash;the solution
of your every material and spiritual desire. And with poverty,
commonplace, hard and poor work as the alternative to all this.</p>

<p>"But you must choose&mdash;choose! And then act. You must! You
must! You must!"</p>

<p>Thus the voice in parting, echoing from some remote part of the
enormous chamber.</p>

<p>And Clyde, listening at first with horror and in terror, later
with a detached and philosophic calm as one who, entirely apart
from what he may think or do, is still entitled to consider even
the wildest and most desperate proposals for his release, at last,
because of his own mental and material weakness before pleasures
and dreams which he could not bring himself to forego, psychically
intrigued to the point where he was beginning to think that it
might be possible. Why not? Was it not even as the voice
said&mdash;a possible and plausible way&mdash;all his desires and
dreams to be made real by this one evil thing? Yet in his case,
because of flaws and weaknesses in his own unstable and highly
variable will, the problem was not to be solved by thinking
thus&mdash;then&mdash;nor for the next ten days for that
matter.</p>

<p>He could not really act on such a matter for himself and would
not. It remained as usual for him to be forced either to act or to
abandon this most <i>wild</i> and terrible thought. Yet during this
time a series of letters&mdash;seven from Roberta, five from
Sondra&mdash;in which in somber tones in so far as Roberta was
concerned&mdash;in gay and colorful ones in those which came from
Sondra&mdash;was painted the now so sharply contrasting phases of
the black rebus which lay before him. To Roberta's pleadings,
argumentative and threatening as they were, Clyde did not trust
himself to reply, not even by telephone. For now he reasoned that
to answer would be only to lure Roberta to her doom&mdash;or to the
attempted drastic conclusion of his difficulties as outlined by the
tragedy at Pass Lake.</p>

<p>At the same time, in several notes addressed to Sondra, he gave
vent to the most impassioned declarations of love&mdash;his
darling&mdash;his wonder girl&mdash;how eager he was to be at
Twelfth Lake by the morning of the Fourth, if he could, and so
thrilled to see her there again. Yet, alas, as he also wrote now,
so uncertain was he, even now, as to how he was to do, there were
certain details in connection with his work here that might delay
him a day or two or three&mdash;he could not tell as yet&mdash;but
would write her by the second at the latest, when he would know
positively. Yet saying to himself as he wrote this, if she but knew
what those details were&mdash;if she but knew. Yet in penning this,
and without having as yet answered the last importunate letter from
Roberta, he was also saying to himself that this did not mean that
he was planning to go to Roberta at all, or that if he did, it did
not mean that he was going to attempt to kill her. Never once did
he honestly, or to put it more accurately, forthrightly and
courageously or coldly face the thought of committing so grim a
crime. On the contrary, the nearer he approached a final resolution
or the need for one in connection with all this, the more hideous
and terrible seemed the idea&mdash;hideous and difficult, and hence
the more improbable it seemed that he should ever commit it. It was
true that from moment to moment&mdash; arguing with himself as he
constantly was&mdash;sweating mental sweats and fleeing from moral
and social terrors in connection with it all, he was thinking from
time to time that he might go to Big Bittern in order to quiet her
in connection with these present importunities and threats and
hence (once more evasion&mdash;tergiversation with himself) give
himself more time in which to conclude what his true course must
be.</p>

<p>The way of the Lake.</p>

<p>The way of the Lake.</p>

<p>But once there&mdash;whether it would then be advisable so to
do&mdash;or not&mdash;well who could tell. He might even yet be
able to convert Roberta to some other point of view. For, say what
you would, she was certainly acting very unfairly and captiously in
all this. She was, as he saw it in connection with his very vital
dream of Sondra, making a mountain&mdash;an immense
terror&mdash;out of a state that when all was said and done, was
not so different from Esta's. And Esta had not compelled any one to
marry her. And how much better were the Aldens to his own
parents&mdash;poor farmers as compared to poor preachers. And why
should he be so concerned as to what they would think when Esta had
not troubled to think what her parents would feel?</p>

<p>In spite of all that Roberta had said about blame, was she so
entirely lacking in blame herself? To be sure, he had sought to
entice or seduce her, as you will, but even so, could she be held
entirely blameless? Could she not have refused, if she was so
positive at the time that she was so very moral? But she had not.
And as to all this, all that he had done, had he not done all he
could to help her out of it? And he had so little money, too. And
was placed in such a difficult position. She was just as much to
blame as he was. And yet now she was so determined to drive him
this way. To insist on his marrying her, whereas if she would only
go her own way&mdash;as she could with his help&mdash;she might
still save both of them all this trouble.</p>

<p>But no, she would not, and he would not marry her and that was
all there was to it. She need not think that she could make him.
No, no, no! At times, when in such moods, he felt that he could do
anything&mdash;drown her easily enough, and she would only have
herself to blame.</p>

<p>Then again his more cowering sense of what society would think
and do, if it knew, what he himself would be compelled to think of
himself afterwards, fairly well satisfied him that as much as he
desired to stay, he was not the one to do anything at all and in
consequence must flee.</p>

<p>And so it was that Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday following
Roberta's letter received on Monday, had passed. And then, on
Thursday night, following a most torturesome mental day on his and
Roberta's part for that matter, this is what he received:</p>

<blockquote>Biltz, Wednesday, June 30th.<br>
<br>
DEAR CLYDE:<br>
<br>
This is to tell you that unless I hear from you either by telephone
or letter before noon, Friday, I shall be in Lycurgus that same
night, and the world will know how you have treated me. I cannot
and will not wait and suffer one more hour. I regret to be
compelled to take this step, but you have allowed all this time to
go in silence really, and Saturday is the third, and without any
plans of any kind. My whole life is ruined and so will yours be in
a measure, but I cannot feel that I am entirely to blame. I have
done all I possibly could to make this burden as easy for you as
possible and I certainly regret all the misery it will cause my
parents and friends and all whom you know and hold dear. But I will
not wait and suffer one hour more.<br>
<br>
ROBERTA.</blockquote>

<p>And with this in his hands, he was finally all but numbed by the
fact that now decidedly he must act. She was actually coming!
Unless he could soothe or restrain her in some manner she would be
here to-morrow&mdash;the second. And yet the second, or the third,
or any time until after the Fourth, was no time to leave with her.
The holiday crowds would be too great. There would be too many
people to see&mdash;to encounter. There must be more secrecy. He
must have at least a little more time in which to get ready. He
must think now quickly and then act. Great God! Get ready. Could he
not telephone her and say that he had been sick or so worried on
account of the necessary money or something that he could not
write&mdash;and that besides his uncle had sent for him to come to
Greenwood Lake over the Fourth. His uncle! His uncle! No, that
would not do. He had used his name too much, what difference should
it make to him or her now, whether he saw his uncle once more or
not? He was leaving once and for all, or so he had been telling
her, on her account, was he not? And so he had better say that he
was going to his uncle, in order to give a reason why he was going
away so that, possibly, he might be able to return in a year or so.
She might believe that. At any rate he must tell her something that
would quiet her until after the Fourth&mdash;make her stay up there
until at least he could perfect some plan&mdash;bring himself to
the place where he could do one thing or the other. One thing or
the other.</p>

<p>Without pausing to plan anything more than just this at this
time, he hurried to the nearest telephone where he was least likely
to be overheard. And, getting her once more, began one of those
long and evasive and, in this instance, ingratiating explanations
which eventually, after he had insisted that he had actually been
sick&mdash; confined to his room with a fever and hence not able to
get to a telephone&mdash;and because, as he now said, he had
finally decided that it would be best if he were to make some
explanation to his uncle, so that he might return some time in the
future, if necessary&mdash;he, by using the most pleading, if not
actually affectionate, tones and asking her to consider what a
state he had been in, too, was able not only to make her believe
that there was some excuse for his delay and silence, but also to
introduce the plan that he now had in mind; which was if only she
could wait until the sixth, then assuredly, without fail as to any
particular, he would meet her at any place she would choose to
come&mdash;Homer, Fonda, Lycurgus, Little Falls&mdash;only since
they were trying to keep everything so secret, he would suggest
that she come to Fonda on the morning of the sixth in order to make
the noon train for Utica. There they could spend the night since
they could not very well discuss and decide on their plans over the
telephone, now, and then they could act upon whatever they had
decided. Besides he could tell her better then just how he thought
they ought to do. He had an idea&mdash;a little trip maybe,
somewhere before they got married or after, just as she wished,
but&mdash;something nice anyhow&mdash;(his voice grew husky and his
knees and hands shook slightly as he said this, only Roberta could
not detect the sudden perturbation within him). But she must not
ask him now. He could not tell her over the phone. But as sure as
anything, at noon on the sixth, he would be on the station platform
at Fonda. All she had to do after seeing him was to buy her ticket
to Utica and get in one coach, and he would buy his separately and
get in another&mdash;the one just ahead or behind hers. On the way
down, if she didn't see him at the station beforehand, he would
pass through her car for a drink so that she could see that he was
there&mdash;no more than that&mdash;but she mustn't speak to him.
Then once in Utica, she should check her bag and he would follow
her out to the nearest quiet corner. After that he would go and get
her bag, and then they could go to some little hotel and he would
take care of all the rest.</p>

<p>But she must do this. Would she have that much faith in him? If
so, he would call her up on the third&mdash;the very next
day&mdash;and on the morning of the sixth&mdash;sure, so that both
he and she would know that everything was all right&mdash;that she
was starting and that he would be there. What was that? Her trunk?
The little one? Sure. If she needed it, certainly bring it. Only,
if he were she, he would not trouble to try to bring too much now,
because once she was settled somewhere, it would be easy enough to
send for anything else that she really needed.</p>

<p>As Clyde stood at the telephone in a small outlying drug store
and talked&mdash;the lonely proprietor buried in a silly romance
among his pots and phials at the back&mdash;it seemed as though the
Giant Efrit that had previously materialized in the silent halls of
his brain, was once more here at his elbow&mdash;that he himself,
cold and numb and fearsome, was being talked through&mdash;not
actually talking himself.</p>

<p>Go to the lake which you visited with Sondra!</p>

<p>Get travel folders of the region there from either the Lycurgus
House here or the depot.</p>

<p>Go to the south end of it and from there walk south,
afterwards.</p>

<p>Pick a boat that will upset easily&mdash;one with a round
bottom, such as those you have seen here at Crum Lake and up
there.</p>

<p>Buy a new and different hat and leave that on the
water&mdash;one that cannot be traced to you. You might even tear
the lining out of it so that it cannot be traced.</p>

<p>Pack all of your things in your trunk here, but leave it, so
that swiftly, in the event that anything goes wrong, you can return
here and get it and depart.</p>

<p>And take only such things with you as will make it seem as
though you were going for an outing to Twelfth Lake&mdash;not away,
so that should you be sought at Twelfth Lake, it will look as
though you had gone only there, not elsewhere.</p>

<p>Tell her that you intend to marry her, but <i>after</i> you
return from this outing, not before.</p>

<p>And if necessary strike a light blow, so as to stun her&mdash;no
more&mdash; so that falling in the water, she will drown the more
easily.</p>

<p>Do not fear!</p>

<p>Do not be weak!</p>

<p>Walk through the woods by night, not by day&mdash;so that when
seen again you will be in Three Mile Bay or Sharon&mdash;and can
say that you came from Racquette or Long Lake south, or from
Lycurgus north.</p>

<p>Use a false name and alter your handwriting as much as
possible.</p>

<p>Assume that you will be successful.</p>

<p>And whisper, whisper&mdash;let your language be soft, your tone
tender, loving, even. It must be, if you are to win her to your
will now.</p>

<p>So the Efrit of his own darker self.</p>

<h3>Chapter 46</h3>

<p>And then at noon on Tuesday, July sixth, the station platform of
the railroad running from Fonda to Utica, with Roberta stepping
down from the train which came south from Biltz to await Clyde, for
the train that was to take them to Utica was not due for another
half hour. And fifteen minutes later Clyde himself coming from a
side street and approaching the station from the south, from which
position Roberta could not see him but from where, after turning
the west corner of the depot and stationing himself behind a pile
of crates, he could see her. How thin and pale indeed! By contrast
with Sondra, how illy-dressed in the blue traveling suit and small
brown hat with which she had equipped herself for this
occasion&mdash;the promise of a restricted and difficult life as
contrasted with that offered by Sondra. And she was thinking of
compelling him to give up Sondra in order to marry her, and from
which union he might never be able to extricate himself until such
time as would make Sondra and all she represented a mere
recollection. The difference between the attitudes of these two
girls&mdash;Sondra with everything offering all&mdash;asking
nothing of him; Roberta, with nothing, asking all.</p>

<p>A feeling of dark and bitter resentment swept over him and he
could not help but feel sympathetic toward that unknown man at Pass
Lake and secretly wish that he had been successful. Perhaps he,
too, had been confronted by a situation just like this. And perhaps
he had done right, too, after all, and that was why it had not been
found out. His nerves twitched. His eyes were somber, resentful and
yet nervous. Could it not happen again successfully in this
case?</p>

<p>But here he was now upon the same platform with her as the
result of her persistent and illogical demands, and he must be
thinking how, and boldly, he must carry out the plans which, for
four days, or ever since he had telephoned her, and in a dimmer way
for the ten preceding those, he had been planning. This settled
course must not be interfered with now. He must act! He must not
let fear influence him to anything less than he had now
planned.</p>

<p>And so it was that he now stepped forth in order that she might
see him, at the same time giving her a wise and seemingly friendly
and informative look as if to say, "You see I am here." But behind
the look! If only she could have pierced beneath the surface and
sensed that dark and tortured mood, how speedily she would have
fled. But now seeing him actually present, a heavy shadow that was
lurking in her eyes lifted, the somewhat down-turned corners of her
mouth reversed themselves, and without appearing to recognize him,
she nevertheless brightened and at once proceeded to the window to
purchase her ticket to Utica, as he had instructed her to do.</p>

<p>And she was now thinking that at last, at last he had come. And
he was going to take her away. And hence a kind of gratefulness for
this welling up in her. For they were to be together for seven or
eight months at the least. And while it might take tact and
patience to adjust things, still it might and probably could be
done. From now on she must be the very soul of caution&mdash;not do
or say anything that would irritate him in any way, since naturally
he would not be in the best mood because of this. But he must have
changed some&mdash;perhaps he was seeing her in a more kindly
light&mdash; sympathizing with her a little, since he now appeared
at last to have most gracefully and genially succumbed to the
unavoidable. And at the same time noting his light gray suit, his
new straw hat, his brightly polished shoes and the dark tan
suitcase and (strange, equivocal, frivolous erraticism of his in
this instance) the tripod of a recently purchased camera together
with his tennis racquet in its canvas case strapped to the
side&mdash;more than anything to conceal the initials C.
G.&mdash;she was seized with much of her old-time mood and desire
in regard to his looks and temperament. He was still, and despite
his present indifference to her, her Clyde.</p>

<p>Having seen her secure her ticket, he now went to get his own,
and then, with another knowing look in her direction, which said
that everything was now all right, he returned to the eastern end
of the platform, while she returned to her position at the forward
end.</p>

<p>(Why was that old man in that old brown winter suit and hat and
carrying that bird cage in a brown paper looking at him so? Could
he sense anything? Did he know him? Had he ever worked in Lycurgus
or seen him before?)</p>

<p>He was going to buy a second straw hat in Utica to-day&mdash;he
must remember that&mdash;a straw hat with a Utica label, which he
would wear instead of his present one. Then, when she was not
looking, he would put the old one in his bag with his other things.
That was why he would have to leave her for a little while after
they reached Utica&mdash;at the depot or library or
somewhere&mdash;perhaps as was his first plan, take her to some
small hotel somewhere and register as Mr. and Mrs. Carl Graham or
Clifford Golden or Gehring (there was a girl in the factory by that
name) so if they were ever traced in any way, it would be assumed
that she had gone away with some man of that name.</p>

<p>(That whistle of a train afar off. It must be coming now. His
watch said twelve-twenty-seven.)</p>

<p>And again he must decide what his manner toward her in Utica
must be&mdash;whether very cordial or the opposite. For over the
telephone, of course, he had talked very soft and genial-like
because he had to. Perhaps it would be best to keep that up,
otherwise she might become angry or suspicious or stubborn and that
would make it hard.</p>

<p>(Would that train never get here?)</p>

<p>At the same time it was going to be very hard on him to be so
very pleasant when, after all, she was driving him as she
was&mdash;expecting him to do all that she was asking him to do and
yet be nice to her. Damn! And yet if he weren't?&mdash;Supposing
she should sense something of his thoughts in connection with
this&mdash;really refuse to go through with it this way and spoil
his plans.</p>

<p>(If only his knees and hands wouldn't tremble so at times.)</p>

<p>But no, how was she to be able to detect anything of that kind,
when he himself had not quite made up his mind as to whether he
would be able to go through with it or not? He only knew he was not
going away with her, and that was all there was to that. He might
not upset the boat, as he had decided on the day before, but just
the same he was not going away with her.</p>

<p>But here now was the train. And there was Roberta lifting her
bag. Was it too heavy for her in her present state? It probably
was. Well, too bad. It was very hot to-day, too. At any rate he
would help her with it later, when they were where no one could see
them. She was looking toward him to be sure he was getting
on&mdash;so like her these days, in her suspicious, doubtful mood
in regard to him. But here was a seat in the rear of the car on the
shady side, too. That was not so bad. He would settle himself
comfortably and look out. For just outside Fonda, a mile or two
beyond, was that same Mohawk that ran through Lycurgus and past the
factory, and along the banks of which the year before, he and
Roberta had walked about this time. But the memory of that being
far from pleasant now, he turned his eyes to a paper he had bought,
and behind which he could shield himself as much as possible, while
he once more began to observe the details of the more inward scene
which now so much more concerned him&mdash;the nature of the lake
country around Big Bittern, which ever since that final important
conversation with Roberta over the telephone, had been interesting
him more than any other geography of the world.</p>

<p>For on Friday, after the conversation, he had stopped in at the
Lycurgus House and secured three different folders relating to
hotels, lodges, inns and other camps in the more remote region
beyond Big Bittern and Long Lake. (If only there were some way to
get to one of those completely deserted lakes described by that
guide at Big Bittern&mdash;only, perhaps, there might not be any
row-boats on any of these lakes at all!) And again on Saturday, had
he not secured four more circulars from the rack at the depot (they
were in his pocket now)? Had they not proved how many small lakes
and inns there were along this same railroad, which ran north to
Big Bittern, to which he and Roberta might resort for a day or two
if she would&mdash;a night, anyhow, before going to Big Bittern and
Grass Lake&mdash;had he not noted that in particular&mdash;a
beautiful lake it had said&mdash;near the station, and with at
least three attractive lodges or country home inns where two could
stay for as low as twenty dollars a week. That meant that two could
stay for one night surely for as little as five dollars. It must be
so surely&mdash; and so he was going to say to her, as he had
already planned these several days, that she needed a little rest
before going away to a strange place. That it would not cost very
much&mdash;about fifteen dollars for fares and all, so the
circulars said&mdash;if they went to Grass Lake for a
night&mdash;this same night after reaching Utica&mdash;or on the
morrow, anyhow. And he would have to picture it all to her as a
sort of honeymoon journey&mdash;a little pleasant
outing&mdash;before getting married. And it would not do to succumb
to any plan of hers to get married before they did this&mdash;that
would never do.</p>

<p>(Those five birds winging toward that patch of trees over
there&mdash; below that hill.)</p>

<p>It certainly would not do to go direct to Big Bittern from Utica
for a boat ride&mdash;just one day&mdash;seventy miles. That would
not sound right to her, or to any one. It would make her
suspicious, maybe. It might be better, since he would have to get
away from her to buy a hat in Utica, to spend this first night
there at some inexpensive, inconspicuous hotel, and once there,
suggest going up to Grass Lake. And from there they could go to Big
Bittern in the morning. He could say that Big Bittern was
nicer&mdash;or that they would go down to Three Mile Bay&mdash;a
hamlet really as he knew&mdash;where they could be married, but en
route stop at Big Bittern as a sort of lark. He would say that he
wanted to show her the lake&mdash;take some pictures of her and
himself. He had brought his camera for that and for other pictures
of Sondra later.</p>

<p>The blackness of this plot of his!</p>

<p>(Those nine black and white cows on that green hillside.)</p>

<p>But again, strapping that tripod along with his tennis racquet
to the side of his suitcase, might not that cause people to imagine
that they were passing tourists from some distant point, maybe, and
if they both disappeared, well, then, they were not people from
anywhere around here, were they? Didn't the guide say that the
water in the lake was all of seventy-five feet deep&mdash;like that
water at Pass Lake? And as for Roberta's grip&mdash;oh, yes, what
about that? He hadn't even thought about that as yet, really.</p>

<p>(Those three automobiles out there running almost as fast as
this train.)</p>

<p>Well, in coming down from Grass Lake after one night there (he
could say that he was going to marry her at Three Mile Bay at the
north end of Greys Lake, where a minister lived whom he had met),
he would induce her to leave her bag at that Gun Lodge station,
where they took the bus over to Big Bittern, while he took his with
him. He could just say to some one&mdash;the boatman, maybe, or the
driver, that he was taking his camera in his bag, and ask where the
best views were. Or maybe a lunch. Was that not a better
idea&mdash;to take a lunch and so deceive Roberta, too, perhaps?
And that would tend to mislead the driver, also, would it not?
People did carry cameras in bags when they went out on lakes, at
times. At any rate it was most necessary for him to carry his bag
in this instance. Else why the plan to go south to that island and
from thence through the woods?</p>

<p>(Oh, the grimness and the terror of this plan! Could he really
execute it?)</p>

<p>But that strange cry of that bird at Big Bittern. He had not
liked that, or seeing that guide up there who might remember him
now. He had not talked to him at all&mdash;had not even gotten out
of the car, but had only looked out at him through the window; and
in so far as he could recall the guide had not even once looked at
him&mdash;had merely talked to Grant Cranston and Harley Baggott,
who had gotten out and had done all the talking. But supposing this
guide should be there and remember him? But how could that be when
he really had not seen him? This guide would probably not remember
him at all&mdash;might not even be there. But why should his hands
and face be damp all the time now&mdash;wet almost, and
cold&mdash;his knees shaky?</p>

<p>(This train was following the exact curve of this
stream&mdash;and last summer he and Roberta. But no&mdash;)</p>

<p>As soon as they reached Utica now this was the way he would
do&mdash;and must keep it well in mind and not get rattled in any
way. He must not&mdash;he must not. He must let her walk up the
street before him, say a hundred feet or so between them, so that
no one would think he was following her, of course. And then when
they were quite alone somewhere he would catch up with her and
explain all about this&mdash;be very nice as though he cared for
her as much as ever now&mdash; he would have to&mdash;if he were to
get her to do as he wanted. And then&mdash;and then, oh, yes, have
her wait while he went for that extra straw hat that he was going
to&mdash;well, leave on the water, maybe. And the oars, too, of
course. And her hat&mdash;and&mdash;well&mdash;</p>

<p>(The long, sad sounding whistle of this train. Damn. He was
getting nervous already.)</p>

<p>But before going to the hotel, he must go back to the depot and
put his new hat in the bag, or better yet, carry it while he looked
for the sort of hotel he wanted, and then, before going to Roberta,
take the hat and put it in his bag. Then he would go and find her
and have her come to the entrance of the hotel he had found and
wait for him, while he got the bags. And, of course, if there was
no one around or very few, they would enter together, only she
could wait in the ladies' parlor somewhere, while he went and
registered as Charles Golden, maybe, this time. And then, well, in
the morning, if she agreed, or to-night, for that matter, if there
were any trains&mdash;he would have to find out about
that&mdash;they could go up to Grass Lake in separate cars until
they were past Twelfth Lake and Sharon, at any rate.</p>

<p>(The beautiful Cranston Lodge there and Sondra.)</p>

<p>And then&mdash;and then&mdash;</p>

<p>(That big red barn and that small white house near it. And that
wind-mill. So like those houses and barns that he had seen out
there in Illinois and Missouri. And Chicago, too.)</p>

<p>And at the same time Roberta in her car forward thinking that
Clyde had not appeared so very unfriendly to her. To be sure, it
was hard on him, making him leave Lycurgus in this way, and when he
might be enjoying himself as he wished to. But on the other hand,
here was she&mdash;and there was no other way for her to be. She
must be very genial and yet not put herself forward too much or in
his way. And yet she must not be too receding or weak, either, for,
after all, Clyde was the one who had placed her in this position.
And it was only fair, and little enough for him to do. She would
have a baby to look after in the future, and all that trouble to go
through with from now on. And later, she would have to explain to
her parents this whole mysterious proceeding, which covered her
present disappearance and marriage, if Clyde really did marry her
now. But she must insist upon that&mdash;and soon&mdash;in Utica,
perhaps&mdash; certainly at the very next place they went
to&mdash;and get a copy of her marriage certificate, too, and keep
it for her own as well as the baby's sake. He could get a divorce
as he pleased after that. She would still be Mrs. Griffiths. And
Clyde's baby and hers would be a Griffiths, too. That was
something.</p>

<p>(How beautiful the little river was. It reminded her of the
Mohawk and the walks she and he had taken last summer when they
first met. Oh, last summer! And now this!)</p>

<p>And they would settle somewhere&mdash;in one or two rooms, no
doubt. Where, she wondered&mdash;in what town or city? How far away
from Lycurgus or Biltz&mdash;the farther from Biltz the better,
although she would like to see her mother and father again, and
soon&mdash;as soon as she safely could. But what matter, as long as
they were going away together and she was to be married?</p>

<p>Had he noticed her blue suit and little brown hat? And had he
thought she looked at all attractive compared to those rich girls
with whom he was always running? She must be very tactful&mdash;not
irritate him in any way. But&mdash;oh, the happy life they could
have if only&mdash;if only he cared for her a little&mdash;just a
little...</p>

<p>And then Utica, and on a quiet street Clyde catching up with
Roberta, his expression a mixture of innocent geniality and
good-will, tempered by worry and opposition, which was really a
mask for the fear of the deed that he himself was
contemplating&mdash;his power to execute it&mdash;the consequences
in case he failed.</p>

<h3>Chapter 47</h3>

<p>And then, as planned that night between them&mdash;a trip to
Grass Lake the next morning in separate cars, but which, upon their
arrival and to his surprise, proved to be so much more briskly
tenanted than he anticipated. He was very much disturbed and
frightened by the evidence of so much active life up here. For he
had fancied this, as well as Big Bittern, would be all but
deserted. Yet here now, as both could see, it was the summer seat
and gathering place of some small religious organization or
group&mdash;the Winebrennarians of Pennsylvania&mdash;as it proved
with a tabernacle and numerous cottages across the lake from the
station. And Roberta at once exclaiming:</p>

<p>"Now, there, isn't that cute? Why couldn't we be married over
there by the minister of that church?"</p>

<p>And Clyde, puzzled and shaken by this sudden and highly
unsatisfactory development, at once announced: "Why,
sure&mdash;I'll go over after a bit and see," yet his mind busy
with schemes for circumventing her. He would take her out in a boat
after registering and getting settled and remain too long. Or
should a peculiarly remote and unobserved spot be found...but no,
there were too many people here. The lake was not large enough, and
probably not very deep. It was black or dark like tar, and
sentineled to the east and north by tall, dark pines&mdash;the
serried spears of armed and watchful giants, as they now seemed to
him&mdash;ogres almost&mdash;so gloomy, suspicious and
fantastically erratic was his own mood in regard to all this. But
still there were too many people&mdash;as many as ten on the
lake.</p>

<p>The weirdness of it.</p>

<p>The difficulty.</p>

<p>But whisper:&mdash;one could not walk from here through any
woods to Three Mile Bay. Oh, no. That was all of thirty miles to
the south now. And besides this lake was less lonely&mdash;probably
continually observed by members of this religious group. Oh,
no&mdash;he must say&mdash; he must say&mdash;but what&mdash;could
he say? That he had inquired, and that no license could be procured
here? Or that the minister was away, or that he required certain
identifications which he did not have&mdash;or&mdash;or, well,
well&mdash;anything that would serve to still Roberta until such
hour to-morrow, as the train south from here left for Big Bittern
and Sharon, where, of course, they would surely be married.</p>

<p>Why should she be so insistent? And why, anyhow, and except for
her crass determination to force him in this way, should he be
compelled to track here and there with her&mdash;every
hour&mdash;every minute of which was torture&mdash;an unending
mental crucifixion really, when, if he were but rid of her! Oh,
Sondra, Sondra, if but now from your high estate, you might bend
down and aid me. No more lies! No more suffering! No more misery of
any kind!</p>

<p>But instead, more lies. A long and aimless and pestilential
search for water-lilies, which because of his own restless mood,
bored Roberta as much as it did him. For why, she was now thinking
to herself as they rowed about, this indifference to this marriage
possibility, which could have been arranged before now and given
this outing the dream quality it would and should have had, if
only&mdash;if only he had arranged for everything in Utica, even as
she had wanted. But this waiting&mdash;evasion&mdash;and so like
Clyde, his vacillating, indefinite, uncertain mood, always. She was
beginning to wonder now as to his intentions again&mdash;whether
really and truly he did intend to marry her as he had promised.
Tomorrow, or the next day at most, would show. So why worry
now?</p>

<p>And then the next day at noon, Gun Lodge and Big Bittern itself
and Clyde climbing down from the train at Gun Lodge and escorting
Roberta to the waiting bus, the while he assured her that since
they were coming back this way, it would be best if she were to
leave her bag here, while he, because of his camera as well as the
lunch done up at Grass Lake and crowded into his suitcase, would
take his own with him, because they would lunch on the lake. But on
reaching the bus, he was dismayed by the fact that the driver was
the same guide whom he had heard talk at Big Bittern. What if it
should prove now that this guide had seen and remembered him! Would
he not at least recall the handsome Finchley car&mdash;Bertine and
Stuart on the front seat&mdash;himself and Sondra at the
back&mdash;Grant and that Harley Baggott talking to him
outside?</p>

<p>At once that cold perspiration that had marked his more nervous
and terrified moods for weeks past, now burst forth on his face and
hands. Of what had he been thinking, anyhow? How planning? In God's
name, how expect to carry a thing like this through, if he were
going to think so poorly? It was like his failing to wear his cap
from Lycurgus to Utica, or at least getting it out of his bag
before he tried to buy that straw hat; it was like not buying the
straw hat before he went to Utica at all.</p>

<p>Yet the guide did not remember him, thank God! On the contrary
he inquired rather curiously, and as of a total stranger: "Goin'
over to the lodge at Big Bittern? First time up here?" And Clyde,
enormously relieved and yet really tremulous, replied: "Yes," and
then in his nervous excitement asked: "Many people over there
to-day?" a question which the moment he had propounded it, seemed
almost insane. Why, why, of all questions, should he ask that? Oh,
God, would his silly, self-destructive mistakes never cease?</p>

<p>So troubled was he indeed, now, that he scarcely heard the
guide's reply, or, if at all, as a voice speaking from a long way
off. "Not so many. About seven or eight, I guess. We did have about
thirty over the Fourth, but most o' them went down yesterday."</p>

<p>The stillness of these pines lining this damp yellow road along
which they were traveling; the cool and the silence; the dark
shadows and purple and gray depths and nooks in them, even at high
noon. If one were slipping away at night or by day, who would
encounter one here? A blue-jay far in the depths somewhere uttered
its metallic shriek; a field sparrow, tremulous upon some distant
twig, filled the silver shadows with its perfect song. And Roberta,
as this heavy, covered bus crossed rill and thin stream, and then
rough wooden bridges here and there, commented on the clarity and
sparkle of the water: "Isn't that wonderful in there? Do you hear
the tinkling of that water, Clyde? Oh, the freshness of this
air!"</p>

<p>And yet she was going to die so soon!</p>

<p>God!</p>

<p>But supposing now, at Big Bittern&mdash;the lodge and boathouse
there&mdash; there were many people. Or that the lake,
peradventure, was literally dotted with those that were
there&mdash;all fishermen and all fishing here and there, each one
separate and alone&mdash;no privacy or a deserted spot anywhere.
And how strange he had not thought of that. This lake was probably
not nearly as deserted as he had imagined, or would not be to-day,
any more than Grass Lake had proved. And then what?</p>

<p>Well, flight then&mdash;flight&mdash;and let it go at that. This
strain was too much&mdash;hell&mdash;he would die, thinking
thoughts like these. How could he have dreamed to better his
fortunes by any so wild and brutal a scheme as this anyhow&mdash;to
kill and then run away&mdash;or rather to kill and pretend that he
and she had drowned&mdash;while he&mdash; the real
murderer&mdash;slipped away to life and happiness. What a horrible
plan! And yet how else? How? Had he not come all this way to do
this? And was he going to turn back now?</p>

<p>And all this time Roberta at his side was imagining that she was
not going to anything but marriage&mdash;tomorrow morning sure; and
now only to the passing pleasure of seeing this beautiful lake of
which he had been talking&mdash;talking, as though it were
something more important and delectable than any that had as yet
been in her or his life for that matter.</p>

<p>But now the guide was speaking again, and to him: "You're not
mindin' to stay over, I suppose. I see you left the young lady's
bag over there." He nodded in the direction of Gun Lodge.</p>

<p>"No, we're going on down to-night&mdash;on that 8:10. You take
people over to that?"</p>

<p>"Oh, sure."</p>

<p>"They said you did&mdash;at Grass Lake."</p>

<p>But now why should he have added that reference to Grass Lake,
for that showed that he and Roberta had been there before coming
here. But this fool with his reference to "the young lady's bag"!
And leaving it at Gun Lodge. The Devil! Why shouldn't he mind his
own business? Or why should he have decided that he and Roberta
were not married? Or had he so decided? At any rate, why such a
question when they were carrying two bags and he had brought one?
Strange! The effrontery! How should he know or guess or what? But
what harm could it do&mdash;married or unmarried? If she were not
found&mdash;"married or unmarried" would make no difference, would
it? And if she were, and it was discovered that she was not
married, would that not prove that she was off with some one else?
Of course! So why worry over that now?</p>

<p>And Roberta asking: "Are there any hotels or boarding houses on
the lake besides this one we're going to?"</p>

<p>"Not a one, miss, outside o' the inn that we're goin' to. There
was a crowd of young fellers and girls campin' over on the east
shore, yisterday, I believe, about a mile from the inn&mdash;but
whether they're there now or not, I dunno. Ain't seen none of 'em
to-day."</p>

<p>A crowd of young fellows and girls! For God's sake! And might
not they now be out on the water&mdash;all of
them&mdash;rowing&mdash;or sailing&mdash;or what? And he here with
her! Maybe some of them from Twelfth Lake! Just as he and Sondra
and Harriet and Stuart and Bertine had come up two weeks
before&mdash;some of them friends of the Cranstons, Harriets,
Finchleys or others who had come up here to play and who would
remember him, of course. And again, then, there must be a road to
the east of this lake. And all this knowledge and their presence
there now might make this trip of his useless. Such silly plotting!
Such pointless planning as this&mdash;when at least he might have
taken more time&mdash;chosen a lake still farther away and should
have&mdash;only so tortured had he been for these last many days,
that he could scarcely think how to think. Well, all he could do
now was to go and see. If there were many he must think of some way
to row to some real lonely spot or maybe turn and return to Grass
Lake&mdash;or where? Oh, what could or would he do&mdash;if there
were many over here?</p>

<p>But just then a long aisle of green trees giving out at the far
end as he now recalled upon a square of lawn, and the lake itself,
the little inn with its pillared verandah, facing the dark blue
waters of Big Bittern. And that low, small red-roofed boathouse to
the right on the water that he had seen before when he was here.
And Roberta exclaiming on sight, "Oh, it is pretty, isn't
it&mdash;just beautiful." And Clyde surveying that dark, low island
in the distance, to the south, and seeing but few people
about&mdash;none on the lake itself&mdash;exclaiming nervously,
"Yes, it is, you bet." But feeling half choked as he said it.</p>

<p>And now the host of the inn himself appearing and
approaching&mdash;a medium-sized, red-faced, broad-shouldered man
who was saying most intriguingly, "Staying over for a few
days?"</p>

<p>But Clyde, irritated by this new development and after paying
the guide a dollar, replying crustily and irritably, "No,
no&mdash;just came over for the afternoon. We're going on down
to-night."</p>

<p>"You'll be staying over for dinner then, I suppose? The train
doesn't leave till eight-fifteen."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes&mdash;that's so. Sure. Yes, well, in that case, we
will."...For, of course, Roberta on her honeymoon&mdash;the day
before her wedding and on a trip like this, would be expecting her
dinner. Damn this stocky, red-faced fool, anyway.</p>

<p>"Well, then, I'll just take your bag and you can register. Your
wife'll probably be wanting to freshen up a bit anyway."</p>

<p>He led the way, bag in hand, although Clyde's greatest desire
was to snatch it from him. For he had not expected to register
here&mdash; nor leave his bag either. And would not. He would
recapture it and hire a boat. But on top of that, being compelled
"for the register's sake," as Boniface phrased it, to sign Clifford
Golden and wife&mdash;before he could take his bag again.</p>

<p>And then to add to the nervousness and confusion engendered by
all this, thoughts as to what additional developments or persons,
even, he might encounter before leaving on his climacteric
errand&mdash; Roberta announcing that because of the heat and the
fact that they were coming back to dinner, she would leave her hat
and coat&mdash;a hat in which he had already seen the label of
Braunstein in Lycurgus&mdash; and which at the time caused him to
meditate as to the wisdom of leaving or extracting it. But he had
decided that perhaps afterwards&mdash;afterwards&mdash;if he should
really do this&mdash;it might not make any difference whether it
was there, or not. Was she not likely to be identified anyhow, if
found, and if not found, who was to know who she was?</p>

<p>In a confused and turbulent state mentally, scarcely realizing
the clarity or import of any particular thought or movement or act
now, he took up his bag and led the way to the boathouse platform.
And then, after dropping the bag into the boat, asking of the
boathouse keeper if he knew where the best views were, that he
wanted to photograph them. And this done&mdash;the meaningless
explanation over, assisting Roberta (an almost nebulous figure, she
now seemed, stepping down into an insubstantial row-boat upon a
purely ideational lake), he now stepped in after her, seating
himself in the center and taking the oars.</p>

<p>The quiet, glassy, iridescent surface of this lake that now to
both seemed, not so much like water as oil&mdash;like molten glass
that, of enormous bulk and weight, resting upon the substantial
earth so very far below. And the lightness and freshness and
intoxication of the gentle air blowing here and there, yet scarcely
rippling the surface of the lake. And the softness and furry
thickness of the tall pines about the shore. Everywhere
pines&mdash;tall and spearlike. And above them the humped backs of
the dark and distant Adirondacks beyond. Not a rower to be seen.
Not a house or cabin. He sought to distinguish the camp of which
the guide had spoken. He could not. He sought to distinguish the
voices of those who might be there&mdash;or any voices. Yet, except
for the lock-lock of his own oars as he rowed and the voice of the
boathouse keeper and the guide in converse two hundred, three
hundred, five hundred, a thousand feet behind, there was no
sound.</p>

<p>"Isn't it still and peaceful?" It was Roberta talking. "It seems
to be so restful here. I think it's beautiful, truly, so much more
beautiful than that other lake. These trees are so tall, aren't
they? And those mountains. I was thinking all the way over how cool
and silent that road was, even if it was a little rough."</p>

<p>"Did you talk to any one in the inn there just now?"</p>

<p>"Why, no; what makes you ask?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I thought you might have run into some one. There don't
seem to be very many people up here to-day, though, does
there?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't see any one on the lake. I saw two men in that
billiard room at the back there, and there was a girl in the
ladies' room, that was all. Isn't this water cold?" She had put her
hand over the side and was trailing it in the blue-black ripples
made by his oars.</p>

<p>"Is it? I haven't felt it yet."</p>

<p>He paused in his rowing and put out his hand, then resumed. He
would not row directly to that island to the south. It
was&mdash;too far&mdash;too early. She might think it odd. Better a
little delay. A little time in which to think&mdash;a little while
in which to reconnoiter. Roberta would be wanting to eat her lunch
(her lunch!) and there was a charming looking point of land there
to the west about a mile further on. They could go there and eat
first&mdash; or she could&mdash;for he would not be eating today.
And then&mdash;and then&mdash;</p>

<p>She was looking at the very same point of land that he
was&mdash;a curved horn of land that bent to the south and yet
reached quite far out into the water and combed with tall pines.
And now she added:</p>

<p>"Have you any spot in mind, dear, where we could stop and eat?
I'm getting a little hungry, aren't you?" (If she would only not
call him <i>dear</i>, here and now!)</p>

<p>The little inn and the boathouse to the north were growing
momentarily smaller,&mdash;looking now, like that other boathouse
and pavilion on Crum Lake the day he had first rowed there, and
when he had been wishing that he might come to such a lake as this
in the Adirondacks, dreaming of such a lake&mdash;and wishing to
meet such a girl as Roberta&mdash;then&mdash;And overhead was one
of those identical woolly clouds that had sailed above him at Crum
Lake on that fateful day.</p>

<p>The horror of this effort!</p>

<p>They might look for water-lilies here today to kill time a
little, before&mdash;to kill time...to kill, (God)&mdash;he must
quit thinking of that, if he were going to do it at all. He needn't
be thinking of it now, at any rate.</p>

<p>At the point of land favored by Roberta, into a minute protected
bay with a small, curved, honey-colored beach, and safe from all
prying eyes north or east. And then he and she stepping out
normally enough. And Roberta, after Clyde had extracted the lunch
most cautiously from his bag, spreading it on a newspaper on the
shore, while he walked here and there, making strained and yet
admiring comments on the beauty of the scene&mdash;the pines and
the curve of this small bay, yet thinking&mdash;thinking, thinking
of the island farther on and the bay below that again somewhere,
where somehow, and in the face of a weakening courage for it, he
must still execute this grim and terrible business before
him&mdash;not allow this carefully planned opportunity to go for
nothing&mdash;if&mdash;if&mdash;he were to not really run away and
leave all that he most desired to keep.</p>

<p>And yet the horror of this business and the danger, now that it
was so close at hand&mdash;the danger of making a mistake of some
kind&mdash;if nothing more, of not upsetting the boat
right&mdash;of not being able to&mdash;to&mdash;oh, God! And
subsequently, maybe, to be proved to be what he would
be&mdash;then&mdash;a murderer. Arrested! Tried. (He could not, he
would not, go through with it. No, no, no!)</p>

<p>And yet Roberta, sitting here with him now on the sand, feeling
quite at peace with all the world as he could see. And she was
beginning to hum a little, and then to make advisory and practical
references to the nature of their coming adventure
together&mdash;their material and financial state from now
on&mdash;how and where they would go from here&mdash;Syracuse, most
likely&mdash;since Clyde seemed to have no objection to
that&mdash;and what, once there, they would do. For Roberta had
heard from her brother-in-law, Fred Gabel, of a new collar and
shirt factory that was just starting up in Syracuse. Might it not
be possible for Clyde, for the time being at least, to get himself
a position with that firm at once? And then later, when her own
worst trouble was over, might not she connect herself with the same
company, or some other? And temporarily, since they had so little
money, could they not take a small room together, somewhere in some
family home, or if he did not like that, since they were by no
means so close temperamentally as they once had been, then two
small adjoining rooms, maybe. She could still feel his unrelenting
opposition under all this present show of courtesy and
consideration.</p>

<p>And he thinking, Oh, well, what difference such talk now? And
whether he agreed or whether he did not. What difference since he
was not going&mdash;or she either&mdash;that way. Great God! But
here he was talking as though tomorrow she would be here still. And
she would not be.</p>

<p>If only his knees would not tremble so; his hands and face and
body continue so damp.</p>

<p>And after that, farther on down the west shore of this small
lake in this little boat, to that island, with Clyde looking
nervously and wearily here and there to see that there was no
one&mdash;no one&mdash; not anywhere in sight on land or
water&mdash;no one. It was so still and deserted here, thank God.
Here&mdash;or anywhere near here might do, really,&mdash;if only he
had the courage so to do now, which he had not,&mdash;yet. Roberta
trailing her hand in the water, asking him if he thought they might
find some water-lilies or wild flowers somewhere on shore.
Water-lilies! Wild flowers! And he convincing himself as he went
that there were no roads, cabins, tents, paths, anything in the
form of a habitation among these tall, close, ranking
pines&mdash;no trace of any little boat on the widespread surface
of this beautiful lake on this beautiful day. Yet might there not
be some lone, solitary hunter and trapper or guide or fisherman in
these woods or along these banks? Might there not be? And supposing
there were one here now somewhere? And watching!</p>

<p>Fate!</p>

<p>Destruction!</p>

<p>Death! Yet no sound and no smoke. Only&mdash;only&mdash;these
tall, dark, green pines&mdash;spear-shaped and still, with here and
there a dead one&mdash;ashen pale in the hard afternoon sun, its
gaunt, sapless arms almost menacingly outstretched.</p>

<p>Death!</p>

<p>And the sharp metallic cry of a blue-jay speeding in the depths
of these woods. Or the lone and ghostly tap-tap-tap of some
solitary woodpecker, with now and then the red line of a flying
tanager, the yellow and black of a yellow-shouldered blackbird.</p>

<p>"Oh, the sun shines bright in my old Kentucky home."</p>

<p>It was Roberta singing cheerfully, one hand in the deep blue
water.</p>

<p>And then a little later&mdash;"I'll be there Sunday if you
will," one of the popular dance pieces of the day.</p>

<p>And then at last, after fully an hour of rowing, brooding,
singing, stopping to look at some charming point of land,
reconnoitering some receding inlet which promised water-lilies, and
with Roberta already saying that they must watch the time and not
stay out too long,&mdash;the bay, south of the island
itself&mdash;a beautiful and yet most funereally pine-encircled and
land delimited bit of water&mdash; more like a smaller lake,
connected by an inlet or passage to the larger one, and yet itself
a respectable body of water of perhaps twenty acres of surface and
almost circular in form. The manner in which to the east, the
north, the south, the west, even, except for the passage by which
the island to the north of it was separated from the mainland, this
pool or tarn was encircled by trees! And cat-tails and water-lilies
here and there&mdash;a few along its shores. And somehow suggesting
an especially arranged pool or tarn to which one who was weary of
life and cares&mdash;anxious to be away from the strife and
contentions of the world, might most wisely and yet gloomily
repair.</p>

<p>And as they glided into this, this still dark water seemed to
grip Clyde as nothing here or anywhere before this ever
had&mdash;to change his mood. For once here he seemed to be fairly
pulled or lured along into it, and having encircled its quiet
banks, to be drifting, drifting&mdash;in endless space where was no
end of anything&mdash; no plots&mdash;no plans&mdash;no practical
problems to be solved&mdash;nothing. The insidious beauty of this
place! Truly, it seemed to mock him&mdash; this
strangeness&mdash;this dark pool, surrounded on all sides by those
wonderful, soft, fir trees. And the water itself looking like a
huge, black pearl cast by some mighty hand, in anger possibly, in
sport or phantasy maybe, into the bosom of this valley of dark,
green plush&mdash;and which seemed bottomless as he gazed into
it.</p>

<p>And yet, what did it all suggest so strongly? Death! Death! More
definitely than anything he had ever seen before. Death! But also a
still, quiet, unprotesting type of death into which one, by reason
of choice or hypnosis or unutterable weariness, might joyfully and
gratefully sink. So quiet&mdash;so shaded&mdash;so serene. Even
Roberta exclaimed over this. And he now felt for the first time the
grip of some seemingly strong, and yet friendly sympathetic, hands
laid firmly on his shoulders. The comfort of them! The warmth! The
strength! For now they seemed to have a steadying effect on him and
he liked them&mdash;their reassurance&mdash;their support. If only
they would not be removed! If only they would remain
always&mdash;the hands of this friend! For where had he ever known
this comforting and almost tender sensation before in all his life?
Not anywhere&mdash;and somehow this calmed him and he seemed to
slip away from the reality of all things.</p>

<p>To be sure, there was Roberta over there, but by now she had
faded to a shadow or thought really, a form of illusion more
vaporous than real. And while there was something about her in
color, form that suggested reality&mdash;still she was very
insubstantial&mdash;so very&mdash; and once more now he felt
strangely alone. For the hands of the friend of firm grip had
vanished also. And Clyde was alone, so very much alone and forlorn,
in this somber, beautiful realm to which apparently he had been
led, and then deserted. Also he felt strangely cold&mdash;the spell
of this strange beauty overwhelming him with a kind of chill.</p>

<p>He had come here for what?</p>

<p>And he must do what?</p>

<p>Kill Roberta? Oh, no!</p>

<p>And again he lowered his head and gazed into the fascinating and
yet treacherous depths of that magnetic, bluish, purple pool,
which, as he continued to gaze, seemed to change its form
kaleidoscopically to a large, crystalline ball. But what was that
moving about in this crystal? A form! It came
nearer&mdash;clearer&mdash; and as it did so, he recognized Roberta
struggling and waving her thin white arms out of the water and
reaching toward him! God! How terrible! The expression on her face!
What in God's name was he thinking of anyway? Death! Murder!</p>

<p>And suddenly becoming conscious that his courage, on which he
had counted so much this long while to sustain him here, was
leaving him, and he instantly and consciously plumbing the depths
of his being in a vain search to recapture it.</p>

<p>Kit, kit, kit, Ca-a-a-ah!<br>
Kit, kit, kit, Ca-a-a-ah!<br>
Kit, kit, kit, Ca-a-a-ah!</p>

<p>(The weird, haunting cry of that unearthly bird again. So cold,
so harsh! Here it was once more to startle him out of his soul
flight into a realization of the real or unreal immediate problem
with all of its torturesome angles that lay before him.)</p>

<p>He must face this thing! He must!</p>

<p>Kit, kit, kit, Ca-a-a-ah!<br>
Kit, kit, kit, Ca-a-a-ah!</p>

<p>What was it sounding&mdash;a warning&mdash;a
protest&mdash;condemnation? The same bird that had marked the very
birth of this miserable plan. For there it was now upon that dead
tree&mdash;that wretched bird. And now it was flying to another
one&mdash;as dead&mdash;a little farther inland and crying as it
did so. God!</p>

<p>And then to the shore again in spite of himself. For Clyde, in
order to justify his having brought his bag, now must suggest that
pictures of this be taken&mdash;and of Roberta&mdash;and of
himself, possibly&mdash;on land and water. For that would bring her
into the boat again, without his bag, which would be safe and dry
on land. And once on shore, actually pretending to be seeking out
various special views here and there, while he fixed in his mind
the exact tree at the base of which he might leave his bag against
his return&mdash;which must be soon now&mdash;must be soon. They
would not come on shore again together. Never! Never! And that in
spite of Roberta protesting that she was getting tired; and did he
not think they ought to be starting back pretty soon? It must be
after five, surely. And Clyde, assuring her that presently they
would&mdash;after he had made one or two more pictures of her in
the boat with those wonderful trees&mdash;that island and this dark
water around and beneath her.</p>

<p>His wet, damp, nervous hands! And his dark, liquid, nervous
eyes, looking anywhere but at her.</p>

<p>And then once more on the water again&mdash;about five hundred
feet from shore, the while he fumbled aimlessly with the hard and
heavy and yet small camera that he now held, as the boat floated
out nearer the center. And then, at this point and time looking
fearfully about. For now&mdash;now&mdash;in spite of himself, the
long evaded and yet commanding moment. And no voice or figure or
sound on shore. No road or cabin or smoke! And the moment which he
or something had planned for him, and which was now to decide his
fate at hand! The moment of action&mdash;of crisis! All that he
needed to do now was to turn swiftly and savagely to one side or
the other&mdash;leap up&mdash;upon the left wale or right and upset
the boat; or, failing that, rock it swiftly, and if Roberta
protested too much, strike her with the camera in his hand, or one
of the oars at his right. It could be done&mdash;it could be
done&mdash;swiftly and simply, were he now of the mind and heart,
or lack of it&mdash;with him swimming swiftly away thereafter to
freedom&mdash;to success&mdash;of course&mdash;to Sondra and
happiness&mdash;a new and greater and sweeter life than any he had
ever known.</p>

<p>Yet why was he waiting now?</p>

<p>What was the matter with him, anyhow?</p>

<p>Why was he waiting?</p>

<p>At this cataclysmic moment, and in the face of the utmost, the
most urgent need of action, a sudden palsy of the will&mdash;of
courage&mdash;of hate or rage sufficient; and with Roberta from her
seat in the stern of the boat gazing at his troubled and then
suddenly distorted and fulgurous, yet weak and even unbalanced
face&mdash;a face of a sudden, instead of angry, ferocious,
demoniac&mdash;confused and all but meaningless in its registration
of a balanced combat between fear (a chemic revulsion against death
or murderous brutality that would bring death) and a harried and
restless and yet self-repressed desire to do&mdash;to do&mdash;to
do&mdash;yet temporarily unbreakable here and now&mdash;a static
between a powerful compulsion to do and yet not to do.</p>

<p>And in the meantime his eyes&mdash;the pupils of the same
growing momentarily larger and more lurid; his face and body and
hands tense and contracted&mdash;the stillness of his position, the
balanced immobility of the mood more and more ominous, yet in truth
not suggesting a brutal, courageous power to destroy, but the
imminence of trance or spasm.</p>

<p>And Roberta, suddenly noticing the strangeness of it
all&mdash;the something of eerie unreason or physical and mental
indetermination so strangely and painfully contrasting with this
scene, exclaiming: "Why, Clyde! Clyde! What is it? Whatever is the
matter with you anyhow? You look so&mdash;so
strange&mdash;so&mdash;so&mdash;Why, I never saw you look like this
before. What is it?" And suddenly rising, or rather leaning
forward, and by crawling along the even keel, attempting to
approach him, since he looked as though he was about to fall
forward into the boat&mdash;or to one side and out into the water.
And Clyde, as instantly sensing the profoundness of his own
failure, his own cowardice or inadequateness for such an occasion,
as instantly yielding to a tide of submerged hate, not only for
himself, but Roberta&mdash;her power&mdash;or that of life to
restrain him in this way. And yet fearing to act in any
way&mdash;being unwilling to&mdash; being willing only to say that
never, never would he marry her&mdash; that never, even should she
expose him, would he leave here with her to marry her&mdash;that he
was in love with Sondra and would cling only to her&mdash;and yet
not being able to say that even. But angry and confused and
glowering. And then, as she drew near him, seeking to take his hand
in hers and the camera from him in order to put it in the boat, he
flinging out at her, but not even then with any intention to do
other than free himself of her&mdash;her touch&mdash; her
pleading&mdash;consoling sympathy&mdash;her presence
forever&mdash;God!</p>

<p>Yet (the camera still unconsciously held tight) pushing at her
with so much vehemence as not only to strike her lips and nose and
chin with it, but to throw her back sidewise toward the left wale
which caused the boat to careen to the very water's edge. And then
he, stirred by her sharp scream, (as much due to the lurch of the
boat, as the cut on her nose and lip), rising and reaching half to
assist or recapture her and half to apologize for the unintended
blow&mdash;yet in so doing completely capsizing the
boat&mdash;himself and Roberta being as instantly thrown into the
water. And the left wale of the boat as it turned, striking Roberta
on the head as she sank and then rose for the first time, her
frantic, contorted face turned to Clyde, who by now had righted
himself. For she was stunned, horror-struck, unintelligible with
pain and fear&mdash;her lifelong fear of water and drowning and the
blow he had so accidentally and all but unconsciously
administered.</p>

<p>"Help! Help!</p>

<p>"Oh, my God, I'm drowning, I'm drowning. Help! Oh, my God!</p>

<p>"Clyde, Clyde!"</p>

<p>And then the voice at his ear!</p>

<p>"But this&mdash;this&mdash;is not this that which you have been
thinking and wishing for this while&mdash;you in your great need?
And behold! For despite your fear, your cowardice,
this&mdash;this&mdash;has been done for you. An accident&mdash;an
accident&mdash;an unintentional blow on your part is now saving you
the labor of what you sought, and yet did not have the courage to
do! But will you now, and when you need not, since it is an
accident, by going to her rescue, once more plunge yourself in the
horror of that defeat and failure which has so tortured you and
from which this now releases you? You might save her. But again you
might not! For see how she strikes about. She is stunned. She
herself is unable to save herself and by her erratic terror, if you
draw near her now, may bring about your own death also. But you
desire to live! And her living will make your life not worth while
from now on. Rest but a moment&mdash;a fraction of a minute!
Wait&mdash;wait&mdash;ignore the pity of that appeal. And
then&mdash; then&mdash;But there! Behold. It is over. She is
sinking now. You will never, never see her alive any
more&mdash;ever. And there is your own hat upon the water&mdash;as
you wished. And upon the boat, clinging to that rowlock a veil
belonging to her. Leave it. Will it not show that this was an
accident?"</p>

<p>And apart from that, nothing&mdash;a few ripples&mdash;the peace
and solemnity of this wondrous scene. And then once more the voice
of that weird, contemptuous, mocking, lonely bird.</p>

<p>Kit, kit, kit, Ca-a-a-ah!<br>
Kit, kit, kit, Ca-a-a-ah!<br>
Kit, kit, kit, Ca-a-a-ah!</p>

<p>The cry of that devilish bird upon that dead limb&mdash;the
wier-wier.</p>

<p>And then Clyde, with the sound of Roberta's cries still in his
ears, that last frantic, white, appealing look in her eyes,
swimming heavily, gloomily and darkly to shore. And the thought
that, after all, he had not really killed her. No, no. Thank God
for that. He had not. And yet (stepping up on the near-by bank and
shaking the water from his clothes) had he? Or, had he not? For had
he not refused to go to her rescue, and when he might have saved
her, and when the fault for casting her in the water, however
accidentally, was so truly his? And yet&mdash;and yet&mdash;</p>

<p>The dusk and silence of a closing day. A concealed spot in the
depths of the same sheltering woods where alone and dripping, his
dry bag near, Clyde stood, and by waiting, sought to dry himself.
But in the interim, removing from the side of the bag the unused
tripod of his camera and seeking an obscure, dead log farther in
the woods, hiding it. Had any one seen? Was any one looking? Then
returning and wondering as to the direction! He must go west and
then south. He must not get turned about! But the repeated cry of
that bird,&mdash;harsh, nerve shaking. And then the gloom, in spite
of the summer stars. And a youth making his way through a dark,
uninhabited wood, a dry straw hat upon his head, a bag in his hand,
walking briskly and yet warily&mdash;south&mdash;south.</p>

<h2>BOOK THREE</h2>

<h3>Chapter 1</h3>

<p>Cataraqui County extending from the northernmost line of the
village known as Three Mile Bay on the south to the Canadian
border, on the north a distance of fifty miles. And from Senaschet
and Indian Lakes on the east to the Rock and Scarf Rivers on the
west&mdash;a width of thirty miles. Its greater portion covered by
uninhabited forests and lakes, yet dotted here and there with such
villages and hamlets as Koontz, Grass Lake, North Wallace, Brown
Lake, with Bridgeburg, the county seat, numbering no less than two
thousand souls of the fifteen thousand in the entire county. And
the central square of the town occupied by the old and yet not
ungraceful county courthouse, a cupola with a clock and some
pigeons surmounting it, the four principal business streets of the
small town facing it.</p>

<p>In the office of the County Coroner in the northeast corner of
the building on Friday, July ninth, one Fred Heit, coroner, a large
and broad-shouldered individual with a set of gray-brown whiskers
such as might have graced a Mormon elder. His face was large and
his hands and his feet also. And his girth was proportionate.</p>

<p>At the time that this presentation begins, about two-thirty in
the afternoon, he was lethargically turning the leaves of a
mail-order catalogue for which his wife had asked him to write. And
while deciphering from its pages the price of shoes, jackets, hats,
and caps for his five omnivorous children, a greatcoat for himself
of soothing proportions, high collar, broad belt, large, impressive
buttons chancing to take his eye, he had paused to consider
regretfully that the family budget of three thousand dollars a year
would never permit of so great luxury this coming winter,
particularly since his wife, Ella, had had her mind upon a fur coat
for at least three winters past.</p>

<p>However his thoughts might have eventuated on this occasion,
they were interrupted by the whirr of a telephone bell.</p>

<p>"Yes, this is Mr. Heit speaking&mdash;Wallace Upham of Big
Bittern. Why, yes, go on, Wallace&mdash;young couple
drowned&mdash;all right, just wait a minute&mdash;"</p>

<p>He turned to the politically active youth who drew a salary from
the county under the listing of "secretary to the
coroner"&mdash;"Get these points, Earl." Then into the telephone:
"All right, Wallace, now give me all the
facts&mdash;everything&mdash;yes. The body of the wife found but
not that of the husband&mdash;yes&mdash;a boat upset on the south
shore&mdash;yes&mdash;straw hat without any
lining&mdash;yes&mdash;some marks about her mouth and eye&mdash;her
coat and hat at the inn&mdash;yes&mdash;a letter in one of the
pockets of the coat&mdash;addressed to who?&mdash;Mrs. Titus Alden,
Biltz, Mimico County&mdash;yes&mdash;still dragging for the man's
body, are they?&mdash;yes&mdash;no trace of him yet&mdash;I see.
All right, Wallace&mdash;Well&mdash;I'll tell you, Wallace, have
them leave the coat and hat just where they are. Let me
see&mdash;it's two-thirty now. I'll be up on the four o'clock. The
bus from the inn there meets that, doesn't it? Well, I'll be over
on that, sure&mdash;And, Wallace, I wish you'd write down the names
of all present who saw the body brought up. What was
that?&mdash;eighteen feet of water at least?&mdash;yes&mdash;a veil
caught in one of the rowlocks&mdash;yes&mdash;a brown
veil&mdash;yes&mdash;sure, that's all&mdash;Well, then have them
leave everything just as found, Wallace, and I'll be right up. Yes,
Wallace, thank you&mdash;Goodbye."</p>

<p>Slowly Mr. Heit restored the receiver to the hook and as slowly
arose from the capacious walnut-hued chair in which he sat,
stroking his heavy whiskers, while he eyed Earl Newcomb,
combination typist, record clerk, and what not.</p>

<p>"You got all that down, did you, Earl?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, you better get your hat and coat and come along with me.
We'll have to catch that 3:10. You can fill in a few subpoenas on
the train. I should say you better take fifteen or twenty&mdash;to
be on the safe side, and take the names of such witnesses as we can
find on the spot. And you better call up Mrs. Heit and say 'taint
likely I'll be home for dinner tonight or much before the down
train. We may have to stay up there until tomorrow. You never can
tell in these cases how they're going to turn out and it's best to
be on the safe side."</p>

<p>Heit turned to a coat-room in one corner of the musty old room
and extracted a large, soft-brimmed, straw hat, the downward
curving edges of which seemed to heighten the really bland and yet
ogreish effect of his protruding eyes and voluminous whiskers, and
having thus equipped himself, said: "I'm just going in the
sheriff's office a minute, Earl. You'd better call up the
Republican and the Democrat and tell 'em about this, so they won't
think we're slightin' 'em. Then I'll meet you down at the station."
And he lumbered out.</p>

<p>And Earl Newcomb, a tall, slender, shock-headed young man of
perhaps nineteen, and of a very serious, if at times befuddled,
manner, at once seized a sheaf of subpoenas, and while stuffing
these in his pocket, sought to get Mrs. Heit on the telephone. And
then, after explaining to the newspapers about a reported double
drowning at Big Bittern, he seized his own blue-banded straw hat,
some two sizes too large for him, and hurried down the hall, only
to encounter, opposite the wide-open office door of the district
attorney, Zillah Saunders, spinster and solitary stenographer to
the locally somewhat famous and mercurial Orville W. Mason,
district attorney. She was on her way to the auditor's office, but
being struck by the preoccupation and haste of Mr. Newcomb, usually
so much more deliberate, she now called: "Hello, Earl. What's the
rush? Where you going so fast?"</p>

<p>"Double drowning up at Big Bittern, we hear. Maybe something
worse. Mr. Heit's going up and I'm going along. We have to make
that 3:10."</p>

<p>"Who said so? Is it anyone from here?"</p>

<p>"Don't know yet, but don't think so. There was a letter in the
girl's pocket addressed to some one in Biltz, Mimico County, a Mrs.
Alden. I'll tell you when we get back or I'll telephone you."</p>

<p>"My goodness, if it's a crime, Mr. Mason'll be interested, won't
he?"</p>

<p>"Sure, I'll telephone him, or Mr. Heit will. If you see Bud
Parker or Karel Badnell, tell 'em I had to go out of town, and call
up my mother for me, will you, Zillah, and tell her, too. I'm
afraid I won't have time."</p>

<p>"Sure I will, Earl."</p>

<p>"Thanks."</p>

<p>And, highly interested by this latest development in the
ordinary humdrum life of his chief, he skipped gayly and even
eagerly down the south steps of the Cataraqui County Courthouse,
while Miss Saunders, knowing that her own chief was off on some
business connected with the approaching County Republican
Convention, and there being no one else in his office with whom she
could communicate at this time, went on to the auditor's office,
where it was possible to retail to any who might be assembled
there, all that she had gathered concerning this seemingly
important lake tragedy.</p>

<h3>Chapter 2</h3>

<p>The information obtained by Coroner Heit and his assistant was
of a singular and disturbing character. In the first instance,
because of the disappearance of a boat and an apparently happy and
attractive couple bent on sight-seeing, an early morning search,
instigated by the inn-keeper of this region, had revealed, in Moon
Cove, the presence of the overturned canoe, also the hat and veil.
And immediately such available employees, as well as guides and
guests of the Inn, as could be impressed, had begun diving into the
waters or by means of long poles equipped with hooks attempting to
bring one or both bodies to the surface. The fact, as reported by
Sim Shoop, the guide, as well as the innkeeper and the boathouse
lessee, that the lost girl was both young and attractive and her
companion seemingly a youth of some means, was sufficient to whet
the interest of this lake group of woodsmen and inn employees to a
point which verged on sorrow. And in addition, there was intense
curiosity as to how, on so fair and windless a day, so strange an
accident could have occurred.</p>

<p>But what created far more excitement after a very little time
was the fact that at high noon one of the men who
trolled&mdash;John Pole&mdash;a woodsman, was at last successful in
bringing to the surface Roberta herself, drawn upward by the skirt
of her dress, obviously bruised about the face&mdash;the lips and
nose and above and below the right eye&mdash;a fact which to those
who were assisting at once seemed to be suspicious. Indeed, John
Pole, who with Joe Rainer at the oars was the one who had succeeded
in bringing her to the surface, had exclaimed at once on seeing
her: "Why, the pore little thing! She don't seem to weigh more'n
nothin' at all. It's a wonder tuh me she coulda sunk." And then
reaching over and gathering her in his strong arms, he drew her in,
dripping and lifeless, while his companions signaled to the other
searchers, who came swiftly. And putting back from her face the
long, brown, thick hair which the action of the water had swirled
concealingly across it, he had added: "I do declare, Joe! Looka
here. It does look like the child mighta been hit by somethin'!
Looka here, Joe!" And soon the group of woodsmen and inn guests in
their boats alongside were looking at the brownish-blue marks on
Roberta's face.</p>

<p>And forthwith, even while the body of Roberta was being taken
north to the boat-house, and the dragging for the body of the lost
man was resumed, suspicions were being voiced in such phrases as:
"Well, it looks kinda queer&mdash;them marks&mdash;an'
all,&mdash;don't it? It's curious a boat like that coulda upset on
a day like yesterday." "We'll soon know if he's down there or
not!"; the feeling, following failure after hours of fruitless
search for him, definitely coalescing at last into the conclusion
that more than likely he was not down there at all&mdash;a hard and
stirring thought to all.</p>

<p>Subsequent to this, the guide who had brought Clyde and Roberta
from Gun Lodge conferring with the inn-keepers at Big Bittern and
Grass Lake, it was factually determined: (1) that the drowned girl
had left her bag at Gun Lodge whereas Clifford Golden had taken his
with him; (2) that there was a disturbing discrepancy between the
registration at Grass Lake and that at Big Bittern, the names Carl
Graham and Clifford Golden being carefully discussed by the two
inn-keepers and the identity of the bearer as to looks established;
and (3) that the said Clifford Golden or Carl Graham had asked of
the guide who had driven him over to Big Bittern whether there were
many people on the lake that day. And thereafter the suspicions
thus far engendered further coalescing into the certainty that
there had been foul play. There was scarcely any doubt of it.</p>

<p>Immediately upon his arrival Coroner Heit was made to understand
that these men of the north woods were deeply moved and in addition
determined in their suspicions. They did not believe that the body
of Clifford Golden or Carl Graham had ever sunk to the bottom of
the lake. With the result that Heit on viewing the body of the
unknown girl laid carefully on a cot in the boat-house, and finding
her young and attractive, was strangely affected, not only by her
looks but this circumambient atmosphere of suspicion. Worse yet, on
retiring to the office of the manager of the inn, and being handed
the letter found in the pocket of Roberta's coat, he was definitely
swayed in the direction of a somber and unshakable suspicion. For
he read:</p>

<blockquote>Grass Lake, N. Y., July 8th.<br>
<br>
DEAREST MAMMA:<br>
<br>
We're up here and we're going to be married, but this is for your
eyes alone. Please don't show it to papa or any one, for it mustn't
become known yet. I told you why at Christmas. And you're not to
worry or ask any questions or tell any one except just that you've
heard from me and know where I am&mdash;not anybody. And you
mustn't think I won't be getting along all right because I will be.
Here's a big hug and kiss for each cheek, mamma. Be sure and make
father understand that it's all right without telling him anything,
or Emily or Tom or Gifford, either, do you hear? I'm sending you
nice, big kisses.<br>
<br>
Lovingly,<br>
<br>
BERT.<br>
<br>
P.S. This must be your secret and mine until I write you different
a little later on.</blockquote>

<p>And in the upper right-hand corner of the paper, as well as on
the envelope, were printed the words: "Grass Lake Inn, Grass Lake,
N. Y., Jack Evans, Prop." And the letter had evidently been written
the morning after the night they had spent at Grass Lake as Mr. and
Mrs. Carl Graham.</p>

<p>The waywardness of young girls!</p>

<p>For plainly, as this letter indicated, these two had stayed
together as man and wife at that inn when they were not as yet
married. He winced as he read, for he had daughters of his own of
whom he was exceedingly fond. But at this point he had a thought. A
quadrennial county election was impending, the voting to take place
the following November, at which were to be chosen for three years
more the entire roster of county offices, his own included, and in
addition this year a county judge whose term was for six years. In
August, some six weeks further on, were to be held the county
Republican and Democratic conventions at which were to be chosen
the regular party nominees for these respective offices. Yet for no
one of these places, thus far, other than that of the county
judgeship, could the present incumbent of the office of district
attorney possibly look forward with any hope, since already he had
held the position of district attorney for two consecutive terms, a
length of office due to the fact that not only was he a good orator
of the inland political stripe but also, as the chief legal
official of the county, he was in a position to do one and another
of his friends a favor. But now, unless he were so fortunate as to
be nominated and subsequently elected to this county judgeship,
defeat and political doldrums loomed ahead. For during all his term
of office thus far, there had been no really important case in
connection with which he had been able to distinguish himself and
so rightfully and hopefully demand further recognition from the
people. But this...</p>

<p>But now, as the Coroner shrewdly foresaw, might not this case
prove the very thing to fix the attention and favor of the people
upon one man&mdash;the incumbent district attorney&mdash;a close
and helpful friend of his, thus far&mdash;and so sufficiently
redound to his credit and strength, and through him to the party
ticket itself, so that at the coming election all might be
elected&mdash;the reigning district attorney thus winning for
himself not only the nomination for but his election to the
six-year term judgeship. Stranger things than this had happened in
the political world.</p>

<p>Immediately he decided not to answer any questions in regard to
this letter, since it promised a quick solution of the mystery of
the perpetrator of the crime, if there had been one, plus
exceptional credit in the present political situation to whosoever
should appear to be instrumental in the same. At the same time he
at once ordered Earl Newcomb, as well as the guide who had brought
Roberta and Clyde to Big Bittern, to return to Gun Lodge station
from where the couple had come and say that under no circumstances
was the bag held there to be surrendered to any one save himself or
a representative of the district attorney. Then, when he was about
to telephone to Biltz to ascertain whether there was such a family
as Alden possessing a daughter by the name of Bert, or possibly
Alberta, he was most providentially, as it seemed to him,
interrupted by two men and a boy, trappers and hunters of this
region, who, accompanied by a crowd of those now familiar with the
tragedy, were almost tumultuously ushered into his presence. For
they had news&mdash;news of the utmost importance! As they now
related, with many interruptions and corrections, at about five
o'clock of the afternoon of the day on which Roberta was drowned,
they were setting out from Three Mile Bay, some twelve miles south
of Big Bittern, to hunt and fish in and near this lake. And, as
they now unanimously testified, on the night in question, at about
nine o'clock, as they were nearing the south shore of Big
Bittern&mdash; perhaps three miles to the south of it&mdash;they
had encountered a young man, whom they took to be some stranger
making his way from the inn at Big Bittern south to the village at
Three Mile Bay. He was a smartishly and decidedly well dressed
youth for these parts, as they now said&mdash;wearing a straw hat
and carrying a bag, and at the time they wondered why such a trip
on foot and at such an hour since there was a train south early
next morning which reached Three Mile Bay in an hour's time. And
why, too, should he have been so startled at meeting them? For as
they described it, on his encountering them in the woods thus, he
had jumped back as though startled and
worse&mdash;terrified&mdash;as though about to run. To be sure, the
lantern one of them was carrying was turned exceedingly low, the
moon being still bright, and they had walked quietly, as became men
who were listening for wild life of any kind. At the same time,
surely this was a perfectly safe part of the country, traversed for
the most part by honest citizens such as themselves, and there was
no need for a young man to jump as though he were seeking to hide
in the brush. However, when the youth, Bud Brunig, who carried the
light, turned it up the stranger seemed to recover his poise and
after a moment in response to their "Howdy" had replied: "How do
you do? How far is it to Three Mile Bay?" and they had replied,
"About seven mile." And then he had gone on and they also,
discussing the encounter.</p>

<p>And now, since the description of this youth tallied almost
exactly with that given by the guide who had driven Clyde over from
Gun Lodge, as well as that furnished by the innkeepers at Big
Bittern and Grass Lake, it seemed all too plain that he must be the
same youth who had been in that boat with the mysterious dead
girl.</p>

<p>At once Earl Newcomb suggested to his chief that he be permitted
to telephone to the one inn-keeper at Three Mile Bay to see if by
any chance this mysterious stranger had been seen or had registered
there. He had not. Nor apparently at that time had he been seen by
any other than the three men. In fact, he had vanished as though
into air, although by nightfall of this same day it was established
that on the morning following the chance meeting of the men with
the stranger, a youth of somewhat the same description and carrying
a bag, but wearing a cap&mdash;not a straw hat&mdash;had taken
passage for Sharon on the small lake steamer "Cygnus" plying
between that place and Three Mile Bay. But again, beyond that
point, the trail appeared to be lost. No one at Sharon, at least up
to this time, seemed to recall either the arrival or departure of
any such person. Even the captain himself, as he later testified,
had not particularly noted his debarkation&mdash;there were some
fourteen others going down the lake that day and he could not be
sure of any one person.</p>

<p>But in so far as the group at Big Bittern was concerned, the
conclusion slowly but definitely impressed itself upon all those
present that whoever this individual was, he was an unmitigated
villain&mdash;a reptilian villain! And forthwith there was doubled
and trebled in the minds of all a most urgent desire that he be
overtaken and captured. The scoundrel! The murderer! And at once
there was broadcast throughout this region by word of mouth,
telephone, telegraph, to such papers as The Argus and Times-Union
of Albany, and The Star of Lycurgus, the news of this pathetic
tragedy with the added hint that it might conceal a crime of the
gravest character.</p>

<h3>Chapter 3</h3>

<p>Coroner Heit, his official duties completed for the time being,
found himself pondering, as he traveled south on the lake train,
how he was to proceed farther. What was the next step he should
take in this pathetic affair? For the coroner, as he had looked at
Roberta before he left was really deeply moved. She seemed so young
and innocent-looking and pretty. The little blue serge dress lying
heavily and clinging tightly to her, her very small hands folded
across her breast, her warm, brown hair still damp from its
twenty-four hours in the water, yet somehow suggesting some of the
vivacity and passion that had invested her in life&mdash;all seemed
to indicate a sweetness which had nothing to do with crime.</p>

<p>But deplorable as it might be, and undoubtedly was, there was
another aspect of the case that more vitally concerned himself.
Should he go to Biltz and convey to the Mrs. Alden of the letter
the dreadful intelligence of her daughter's death, at the same time
inquiring about the character and whereabouts of the man who had
been with her, or should he proceed first to District Attorney
Mason's office in Bridgeburg and having imparted to him all of the
details of the case, allow that gentleman to assume the painful
responsibility of devastating a probably utterly respectable home?
For there was the political situation to be considered. And while
he himself might act and so take personal credit, still there was
this general party situation to be thought of. A strong man should
undoubtedly head and so strengthen the party ticket this fall and
here was the golden opportunity. The latter course seemed wiser. It
would provide his friend, the district attorney, with his great
chance. Arriving in Bridgeburg in this mood, he ponderously invaded
the office of Orville W. Mason, the district attorney, who
immediately sat up, all attention, sensing something of import in
the coroner's manner.</p>

<p>Mason was a short, broad-chested, broad-backed and vigorous
individual physically, but in his late youth had been so
unfortunate as to have an otherwise pleasant and even arresting
face marred by a broken nose, which gave to him a most
unprepossessing, almost sinister, look. Yet he was far from
sinister. Rather, romantic and emotional. His boyhood had been one
of poverty and neglect, causing him in his later and somewhat more
successful years to look on those with whom life had dealt more
kindly as too favorably treated. The son of a poor farmer's widow,
he had seen his mother put to such straits to make ends meet that
by the time he reached the age of twelve he had surrendered nearly
all of the pleasures of youth in order to assist her. And then, at
fourteen, while skating, he had fallen and broken his nose in such
a way as to forever disfigure his face. Thereafter, feeling himself
handicapped in the youthful sorting contests which gave to other
boys the female companions he most craved, he had grown exceedingly
sensitive to the fact of his facial handicap. And this had
eventually resulted in what the Freudians are accustomed to
describe as a psychic sex scar.</p>

<p>At the age of seventeen, however, he had succeeded in
interesting the publisher and editor of the Bridgeburg Republican
to the extent that he was eventually installed as official local
news-gatherer of the town. Later he came to be the Cataraqui County
correspondent of such papers as the Albany Times-Union and the
Utica Star, ending eventually at the age of nineteen with the
privilege of studying law in the office of one ex-Judge Davis
Richofer, of Bridgeburg. And a few years later, after having been
admitted to the bar, he had been taken up by several county
politicians and merchants who saw to it that he was sent to the
lower house of the state legislature for some six consecutive
years, where, by reason of a modest and at the same time shrewd and
ambitious willingness to do as he was instructed, he attained favor
with those at the capital while at the same time retaining the good
will of his home-town sponsors. Later, returning to Bridgeburg and
possessing some gifts of oratory, he was given, first, the position
of assistant district attorney for four years, and following that
elected auditor, and subsequently district attorney for two terms
of four years each. Having acquired so high a position locally, he
was able to marry the daughter of a local druggist of some means,
and two children had been born to them.</p>

<p>In regard to this particular case he had already heard from Miss
Saunders all she knew of the drowning, and, like the coroner, had
been immediately impressed with the fact that the probable
publicity attendant on such a case as this appeared to be might be
just what he needed to revive a wavering political prestige and
might perhaps solve the problem of his future. At any rate he was
most intensely interested. So that now, upon sight of Heit, he
showed plainly the keen interest he felt in the case.</p>

<p>"Well, Colonel Heit?"</p>

<p>"Well, Orville, I'm just back from Big Bittern. It looks to me
as though I've got a case for you now that's going to take quite a
little of your time."</p>

<p>Heit's large eyes bulged and conveyed hints of much more than
was implied by his non-committal opening remark.</p>

<p>"You mean that drowning up there?" returned the district
attorney.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. Just that," replied the coroner.</p>

<p>"You've some reason for thinking there's something wrong up
there?"</p>

<p>"Well, the truth is, Orville, I think there's hardly a doubt
that this is a case of murder." Heit's heavy eyes glowed somberly.
"Of course, it's best to be on the safe side, and I'm only telling
you this in confidence, because even yet I'm not absolutely
positive that that young man's body may not be in the lake. But it
looks mighty suspicious to me, Orville. There's been at least
fifteen men up there in row-boats all day yesterday and to-day,
dragging the south part of that lake. I had a number of the boys
take soundings here and there, and the water ain't more than
twenty-five feet deep at any point. But so far they haven't found
any trace of him. They brought her up about one o'clock yesterday,
after they'd been only dragging a few hours, and a mighty pretty
girl she is too, Orville&mdash;quite young&mdash;not more than
eighteen or twenty, I should say. But there are some very
suspicious circumstances about it all that make me think that he
ain't in there. In fact, I never saw a case that I thought looked
more like a devilish crime than this."</p>

<p>As he said this, he began to search in the right-hand pocket of
his well-worn and baggy linen suit and finally extracted Roberta's
letter, which he handed his friend, drawing up a chair and seating
himself while the district attorney proceeded to read.</p>

<p>"Well, this does look rather suspicious, don't it?" he
announced, as he finished. "You say they haven't found him yet.
Well, have you communicated with this woman to see what she knows
about it?"</p>

<p>"No, Orville, I haven't," replied Heit, slowly and meditatively.
"And I'll tell you why. The fact is, I decided up there last night
that this was something I had better talk over with you before I
did anything at all. You know what the political situation here is
just now. And how the proper handling of a case like this is likely
to affect public opinion this fall. And while I certainly don't
think we ought to mix politics in with crime there certainly is no
reason why we shouldn't handle this in such a way as to make it
count in our favor. And so I thought I had better come and see you
first. Of course, if you want me to, Orville, I'll go over there.
Only I was thinking that perhaps it would be better for you to go,
and find out just who this fellow is and all about him. You know
what a case like this might mean from a political point of view, if
only we clean it up, and I know you're the one to do it,
Orville."</p>

<p>"Thanks, Fred, thanks," replied Mason, solemnly, tapping his
desk with the letter and squinting at his friend. "I'm grateful to
you for your opinion and you've outlined the very best way to go
about it, I think. You're sure no one outside yourself has seen
this letter?"</p>

<p>"Only the envelope. And no one but Mr. Hubbard, the proprietor
of the inn up there, has seen that, and he told me that he found it
in her pocket and took charge of it for fear it might disappear or
be opened before I got there. He said he had a feeling there might
be something wrong the moment he heard of the drowning. The young
man had acted so nervous&mdash;strange-like, he said."</p>

<p>"Very good, Fred. Then don't say anything more about it to any
one for the present, will you? I'll go right over there, of course.
But what else did you find, anything?" Mr. Mason was quite alive
now, interrogative, dynamic, and a bit dictatorial in his manner,
even to his old friend.</p>

<p>"Plenty, plenty," replied the coroner, most sagely and solemnly.
"There were some suspicious cuts or marks under the girl's right
eye and above the left temple, Orville, and across the lip and
nose, as though the poor little thing mighta been hit by
something&mdash; a stone or a stick or one of those oars that they
found floating up there. She's just a child yet, Orville, in looks
and size, anyhow&mdash;a very pretty girl&mdash;but not as good as
she might have been, as I'll show you presently." At this point the
coroner paused to extract a large handkerchief and blow into it a
very loud blast, brushing his beard afterward in a most orderly
way. "I didn't have time to get a doctor up there and besides I'm
going to hold the inquest down here, Monday, if I can. I've ordered
the Lutz boys to go up there to-day and bring her body down. But
the most suspicious of all the evidence that has come to light so
far, Orville, is the testimony of two men and a boy who live up at
Three Mile Bay and who were walking up to Big Bittern on Thursday
night to hunt and fish. I had Earl take down their names and
subpoena 'em for the inquest next Monday."</p>

<p>And the coroner proceeded to detail their testimony about their
accidental meeting of Clyde.</p>

<p>"Well, well!" interjected the district attorney, thoroughly
interested.</p>

<p>"Then, another thing, Orville," continued the coroner, "I had
Earl telephone the Three Mile Bay people, the owner of the hotel
there as well as the postmaster and the town marshal, but the only
person who appears to have seen the young man is the captain of
that little steamboat that runs from Three Mile Bay to Sharon. You
know the man, I guess, Captain Mooney. I left word with Earl to
subpoena him too. According to him, about eight-thirty, Friday
morning, or just before his boat started for Sharon on its first
trip, this same young man, or some one very much like the
description furnished, carrying a suitcase and wearing a
cap&mdash;he had on a straw hat when those three men met
him&mdash;came on board and paid his way to Sharon and got off
there. Good-looking young chap, the captain says. Very spry and
well-dressed, more like a young society man than anything else, and
very stand-offish."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," commented Mason.</p>

<p>"I also had Earl telephone the people at Sharon&mdash;whoever he
could reach&mdash;to see if he had been seen there getting off, but
up to the time I left last night no one seemed to remember him. But
I left word for Earl to telegraph a description of him to all the
resort hotels and stations hereabouts so that if he's anywhere
around, they'll be on the lookout for him. I thought you'd want me
to do that. But I think you'd better give me a writ for that bag at
Gun Lodge station. That may contain something we ought to know.
I'll go up and get it myself. Then I want to go to Grass Lake and
Three Mile Bay and Sharon yet to-day, if I can, and see what else I
can find. But I'm afraid, Orville, it's a plain case of murder. The
way he took that young girl to that hotel up there at Grass Lake
and then registered under another name at Big Bittern, and the way
he had her leave her bag and took his own with him!" He shook his
head most solemnly. "Those are not the actions of an honest young
man, Orville, and you know it. What I can't understand is how her
parents could let her go off like that anywhere with a man without
knowing about him in the first place."</p>

<p>"That's true," replied Mason, tactfully, but made intensely
curious by the fact that it had at least been partially established
that the girl in the case was not as good as she should have been.
Adultery! And with some youth of means, no doubt, from some one of
the big cities to the south. The prominence and publicity with
which his own activities in connection with this were very likely
to be laden! At once he got up, energetically stirred. If he could
only catch such a reptilian criminal, and that in the face of all
the sentiment that such a brutal murder was likely to inspire! The
August convention and nominations. The fall election.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll be switched," he exclaimed, the presence of Heit, a
religious and conservative man, suppressing anything more emphatic.
"I do believe we're on the trail of something important, Fred. I
really think so. It looks very black to me&mdash;a most damnable
outrage. I suppose the first thing to do, really, is to telephone
over there and see if there is such a family as Alden and exactly
where they live. It's not more than fifty miles direct by car, if
that much. Poor roads, though," he added. Then: "That poor woman. I
dread that scene. It will be a painful one, I know."</p>

<p>Then he called Zillah and asked her to ascertain if there was
such a person as Titus Alden living near Biltz. Also, exactly how
to get there. Next he added: "The first thing to do will be to get
Burton back here" (Burton being Burton Burleigh, his legal
assistant, who had gone away for a week-end vacation) "and put him
in charge so as to furnish you whatever you need in the way of
writs and so on, Fred, while I go right over to see this poor
woman. And then, if you'll have Earl go back up there and get that
suitcase, I'll be most obliged to you. I'll bring the father back
with me, too, to identify the body. But don't say anything at all
about this letter now or my going over there until I see you later,
see." He grasped the hand of his friend. "In the meantime," he went
on, a little grandiosely, now feeling the tang of great affairs
upon him, "I want to thank you, Fred. I certainly do, and I won't
forget it, either. You know that, don't you?" He looked his old
friend squarely in the eye. "This may turn out better than we
think. It looks to be the biggest and most important case in all my
term of office, and if we can only clean it up satisfactorily and
quickly, before things break here this fall, it may do us all some
good, eh?"</p>

<p>"Quite so, Orville, quite so," commented Fred Heit. "Not, as I
said before, that I think we ought to mix politics in with a thing
like this, but since it has come about so&mdash;" he paused,
meditatively.</p>

<p>"And in the meantime," continued the district attorney "if
you'll have Earl have some pictures made of the exact position
where the boat, oars, and hat were found, as well as mark the spot
where the body was found, and subpoena as many witnesses as you
can, I'll have vouchers for it all put through with the auditor.
And to-morrow or Monday I'll pitch in and help myself."</p>

<p>And here he gripped Heit's right hand&mdash;then patted him on
the shoulder. And Heit, much gratified by his various moves so
far&mdash; and in consequence hopeful for the future&mdash;now took
up his weird straw hat and buttoning his thin, loose coat, returned
to his office to get his faithful Earl on the long distance
telephone to instruct him and to say that he was returning to the
scene of the crime himself.</p>

<h3>Chapter 4</h3>

<p>Orville Mason could readily sympathize with a family which on
sight struck him as having, perhaps, like himself endured the
whips, the scorns and contumelies of life. As he drove up in his
official car from Bridgeburg at about four o'clock that Saturday
afternoon, there was the old tatterdemalion farmhouse and Titus
Alden himself in his shirt-sleeves and overalls coming up from a
pig-pen at the foot of the hill, his face and body suggesting a man
who is constantly conscious of the fact that he has made out so
poorly. And now Mason regretted that he had not telephoned before
leaving Bridgeburg, for he could see that the news of his
daughter's death would shock such a man as this most terribly. At
the same time, Titus, noting his approach and assuming that it
might be some one who was seeking a direction, civilly approached
him.</p>

<p>"Is this Mr. Titus Alden?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, that's my name."</p>

<p>"Mr. Alden, my name is Mason. I am from Bridgeburg, district
attorney of Cataraqui County."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied Titus, wondering by what strange chance the
district attorney of so distant a county should be approaching and
inquiring of him. And Mason now looked at Titus, not knowing just
how to begin. The bitterness of the news he had to impart&mdash;the
crumpling power of it upon such an obviously feeble and inadequate
soul. They had paused under one of the large, dark fir trees that
stood in front of the house. The wind in its needles was whispering
its world-old murmur.</p>

<p>"Mr. Alden," began Mason, with more solemnity and delicacy than
ordinarily characterized him, "you are the father of a girl by the
name of Bert, or possibly Alberta, are you not? I'm not sure that I
have the name right."</p>

<p>"Roberta," corrected Titus Alden, a titillating sense of
something untoward affecting his nerves as he said it.</p>

<p>And Mason, before making it impossible, probably, for this man
to connectedly inform him concerning all that he wished to know,
now proceeded to inquire: "By the way, do you happen to know a
young man around here by the name of Clifford Golden?"</p>

<p>"I don't recall that I ever hard of any such person," replied
Titus, slowly.</p>

<p>"Or Carl Graham?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. No one by that name either that I recall now."</p>

<p>"I thought so," exclaimed Mason, more to himself than to Titus.
"By the way," this shrewdly and commandingly, "where is your
daughter now?"</p>

<p>"Why, she's in Lycurgus at present. She works there. But why do
you ask? Has she done anything she shouldn't&mdash;been to see you
about anything?" He achieved a wry smile while his gray-blue eyes
were by now perturbed by puzzled inquiry.</p>

<p>"One moment, Mr. Alden," proceeded Mason, tenderly and yet most
firmly and effectively. "I will explain everything to you in a
moment. Just now I want to ask a few necessary questions." And he
gazed at Titus earnestly and sympathetically. "How long has it been
since you last saw your daughter?"</p>

<p>"Why, she left here last Tuesday morning to go back to Lycurgus.
She works down there for the Griffiths Collar &amp; Shirt Company.
But&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Now, one moment," insisted the district attorney determinedly,
"I'll explain all in a moment. She was up here over the week-end,
possibly. Is that it?"</p>

<p>"She was up here on a vacation for about a month," explained
Titus, slowly and meticulously. "She wasn't feeling so very good
and she came home to rest up a bit. But she was all right when she
left. You don't mean to tell me, Mr. Mason, that anything has gone
wrong with her, do you?" He lifted one long, brown hand to his chin
and cheek in a gesture, of nervous inquiry. "If I thought there was
anything like that&mdash;?" He ran his hand through his thinning
gray hair.</p>

<p>"Have you had any word from her since she left here?" Mason went
on quietly, determined to extract as much practical information as
possible before the great blow fell. "Any information that she was
going anywhere but back there?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, we haven't. She's not hurt in any way, is she? She's
not done anything that's got her into trouble? But, no, that
couldn't be. But your questions! The way you talk." He was now
trembling slightly, the hand that sought his thin, pale lips,
visibly and aimlessly playing about his mouth. But instead of
answering, the district attorney drew from his pocket the letter of
Roberta to her mother, and displaying only the handwriting on the
envelope, asked: "Is that the handwriting of your daughter?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, that's her handwriting," replied Titus, his voice
rising slightly. "But what is this, Mr. District Attorney? How do
you come to have that? What's in there?" He clinched his hands in a
nervous way, for in Mason's eyes he now clearly foresaw tragedy in
some form. "What is this&mdash;this&mdash;what has she written in
that letter? You must tell me&mdash;if anything has happened to my
girl!" He began to look excitedly about as though it were his
intention to return to the house for aid&mdash;to communicate to
his wife the dread that was coming upon him&mdash;while Mason,
seeing the agony into which he had plunged him, at once seized him
firmly and yet kindly by the arms and began:</p>

<p>"Mr. Alden, this is one of those dark times in the lives of some
of us when all the courage we have is most needed. I hesitate to
tell you because I am a man who has seen something of life and I
know how you will suffer."</p>

<p>"She is hurt. She is dead, maybe," exclaimed Titus, almost
shrilly, the pupils of his eyes dilating.</p>

<p>Orville Mason nodded.</p>

<p>"Roberta! My first born! My God! Our Heavenly Father!" His body
crumpled as though from a blow and he leaned to steady himself
against an adjacent tree. "But how? Where? In the factory by a
machine? Oh, dear God!" He turned as though to go to his wife,
while the strong, scar-nosed district attorney sought to detain
him.</p>

<p>"One moment, Mr. Alden, one moment. You must not go to your wife
yet. I know this is very hard, terrible, but let me explain. Not in
Lycurgus. Not by any machine. No! No&mdash;drowned! In Big Bittern.
She was up there on an outing on Thursday, do you understand? Do
you hear? Thursday. She was drowned in Big Bittern on Thursday in a
boat. It overturned."</p>

<p>The excited gestures and words of Titus at this point so
disturbed the district attorney that he found himself unable to
explain as calmly as he would have liked the process by which even
an assumed accidental drowning had come about. From the moment the
word death in connection with Roberta had been used by Mason, the
mental state of Alden was that of one not a little demented. After
his first demands he now began to vent a series of animal-like
groans as though the breath had been knocked from his body. At the
same time, he bent over, crumpled up as from pain&mdash;then struck
his hands together and threw them to his temples.</p>

<p>"My Roberta dead! My daughter! Oh, no, no, Roberta! Oh, my God!
Not drowned! It can't be. And her mother speaking of her only an
hour ago. This will be the death of her when she hears it. It will
kill me, too. Yes, it will. Oh, my poor, dear, dear girl. My
darling! I'm not strong enough to stand anything like this, Mr.
District Attorney."</p>

<p>He leaned heavily and wearily upon Mason's arms while the latter
sustained him as best he could. Then, after a moment, he turned
questioningly and erratically toward the front door of the house at
which he gazed as one might who was wholly demented. "Who's to tell
her?" he demanded. "How is any one to tell her?"</p>

<p>"But, Mr. Alden," consoled Mason, "for your own sake, for your
wife's sake, I must ask you now to calm yourself and help me
consider this matter as seriously as you would if it were not your
daughter. There is much more to this than I have been able to tell
you. But you must be calm. You must allow me to explain. This is
all very terrible and I sympathize with you wholly. I know what it
means. But there are some dreadful and painful facts that you will
have to know about. Listen. Listen."</p>

<p>And then, still holding Titus by the arm he proceeded to explain
as swiftly and forcefully as possible, the various additional facts
and suspicions in connection with the death of Roberta, finally
giving him her letter to read, and winding up with: "A crime! A
crime, Mr. Alden! That's what we think over in Bridgeburg, or at
least that's what we're afraid of&mdash;plain murder, Mr. Alden, to
use a hard, cold word in connection with it." He paused while
Alden, struck by this&mdash;the element of crime&mdash;gazed as one
not quite able to comprehend. And, as he gazed, Mason went on: "And
as much as I respect your feelings, still as the chief
representative of the law in my county, I felt it to be my personal
duty to come here to-day in order to find out whether there is
anything that you or your wife or any of your family know about
this Clifford Golden, or Carl Graham, or whoever he is who lured
your daughter to that lonely lake up there. And while I know that
the blackest of suffering is yours right now, Mr. Alden, I maintain
that it should be your wish, as well as your duty, to do whatever
you can to help us clear up this matter. This letter here seems to
indicate that your wife at least knows something concerning this
individual&mdash;his name, anyhow." And he tapped the letter
significantly and urgently.</p>

<p>The moment the suggested element of violence and wrong against
his daughter had been injected into this bitter loss, there was
sufficient animal instinct, as well as curiosity, resentment and
love of the chase inherent in Titus to cause him to recover his
balance sufficiently to give silent and solemn ear to what the
district attorney was saying. His daughter not only drowned, but
murdered, and that by some youth who according to this letter she
was intending to marry! And he, her father, not even aware of his
existence! Strange that his wife should know and he not. And that
Roberta should not want him to know.</p>

<p>And at once, born for the most part of religion, convention and
a general rural suspicion of all urban life and the mystery and
involuteness of its ungodly ways, there sprang into his mind the
thought of a city seducer and betrayer&mdash;some youth of means,
probably, whom Roberta had met since going to Lycurgus and who had
been able to seduce her by a promise of marriage which he was not
willing to fulfil. And forthwith there flared up in his mind a
terrible and quite uncontrollable desire for revenge upon any one
who could plot so horrible a crime as this against his daughter.
The scoundrel! The raper! The murderer!</p>

<p>Here he and his wife had been thinking that Roberta was quietly
and earnestly and happily pursuing her hard, honest way in Lycurgus
in order to help them and herself. And from Thursday afternoon
until Friday her body had lain beneath the waters of that lake. And
they asleep in their comfortable beds, or walking about, totally
unaware of her dread state. And now her body in a strange room or
morgue somewhere, unseen and unattended by any of all those who
loved her so&mdash;and to-morrow to be removed by cold, indifferent
public officials to Bridgeburg.</p>

<p>"If there is a God," he exclaimed excitedly, "He will not let
such a scoundrel as this go unpunished! Oh, no, He will not! 'I
have yet to see,'" he suddenly quoted, "'the children of the
righteous forsaken or their seed begging for bread.'" At the same
time, a quivering compulsion for action dominating him, he added:
"I must talk to my wife about this right away. Oh, yes, I must. No,
no, you wait here. I must tell her first, and alone. I'll be back.
I'll be back. You just wait here. I know it will kill her. But she
must know about this. Maybe she can tell us who this is and then we
can catch him before he manages to get too far away. But, oh, my
poor girl! My poor, dear Roberta! My good, kind, faithful
daughter!"</p>

<p>And so, talking in a maundering manner, his eyes and face
betraying an only half-sane misery, he turned, the shambling,
automaton-like motions of his angular figure now directing him to a
lean-to, where, as he knew, Mrs. Alden was preparing some extra
dishes for the next day, which was Sunday. But once there he paused
in the doorway without the courage to approach further, a man
expressing in himself all the pathos of helpless humanity in the
face of the relentless and inexplicable and indifferent forces of
Life!</p>

<p>Mrs. Alden turned, and at the sight of his strained expression,
dropped her own hands lifelessly, the message of his eyes as
instantly putting to flight the simple, weary and yet peaceful
contemplation in her own.</p>

<p>"Titus! For goodness' sake! Whatever <i>is</i> the matter?"</p>

<p>Lifted hands, half-open mouth, an eerie, eccentric and
uncalculated tensing and then widening of the eyelids, and then the
word: "Roberta!"</p>

<p>"What about her? What about her? Titus&mdash;what about
her?"</p>

<p>Silence. More of those nervous twitchings of the mouth eyes,
hands. Then..."Dead! She's been&mdash;been drowned!" followed by
his complete collapse on a bench that stood just inside the door.
And Mrs. Alden, staring for a moment, at first not quite
comprehending, then fully realizing, sinking heavily and without a
word to the floor. And Titus, looking at her and nodding his head
as if to say: "Quite right. So should it be. Momentary escape for
her from the contemplation of this horrible fact." And then slowly
rising, going to her and kneeling beside her, straightening her
out. Then as slowly going out to the door and around to the front
of the house where Orville Mason was seated on the broken front
steps, contemplating speculatively along with the afternoon sun in
the west the misery that this lorn and incompetent farmer was
conveying to his wife. And wishing for the moment that it might be
otherwise&mdash;that no such case, however profitable to himself,
had arisen.</p>

<p>But now, at sight of Titus Alden, he jumped up and preceded the
skeleton-like figure into the lean-to. And finding Mrs. Alden, as
small as her daughter nearly, and limp and still, he gathered her
into his strong arms and carried her through the dining-room into
the living-room, where stood an antiquated lounge, on which he laid
her. And there, feeling for her pulse, and then hurrying for some
water, while he looked for some one&mdash;a son, daughter,
neighbor, any one. But not seeing any one, hurrying back with the
water to dash a little of it on her face and hands.</p>

<p>"Is there a doctor anywhere near here?" He was addressing Titus,
who was now kneeling by his wife.</p>

<p>"In Biltz&mdash;yes&mdash;Dr. Crane."</p>

<p>"Have you&mdash;has any one around here a telephone?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Wilcox." He pointed in the direction of the Wilcox's, whose
telephone Roberta had so recently used.</p>

<p>"Just watch her. I'll be back."</p>

<p>Forthwith he was out of the house and away to call Crane or any
other doctor, and then as swiftly returning with Mrs. Wilcox and
her daughter. And then waiting, waiting, until first neighbors
arrived and then eventually Dr. Crane, with whom he consulted as to
the advisability of discussing with Mrs. Alden yet this day the
unescapable mystery which had brought him here. And Dr. Crane, very
much impressed by Mr. Mason's solemn, legal manner, admitting that
it might even be best.</p>

<p>And at last Mrs. Alden treated with heroin and crooned and
mourned over by all present, being brought to the stage where it
was possible, slowly and with much encouragement, to hear in the
first place what the extenuating circumstances were; next being
questioned concerning the identity of the cryptic individual
referred to in Roberta's letter. The only person whom Mrs. Alden
could recall as ever having been mentioned by Roberta as paying
particular attention to her, and that but once the Christmas
before, was Clyde Griffiths, the nephew of the wealthy Samuel
Griffiths, of Lycurgus, and the manager of the department in which
Roberta worked.</p>

<p>But this in itself, as Mason and the Aldens themselves at once
felt, was something which assuredly could not be taken to mean that
the nephew of so great a man could be accused of the murder of
Roberta. Wealth! Position! Indeed, in the face of such an
accusation Mason was inclined to pause and consider. For the social
difference between this man and this girl from his point of view
seemed great. At that, it might be so. Why not? Was it not likely
that a youth of such a secure position would possibly more than
another, since she was so attractive as Heit had said, be the one
to be paying casual and secret attention to a girl like Roberta?
Did she not work in his uncle's factory? And was she not poor?
Besides, as Fred Heit had already explained, whoever it was that
this girl was with at the time of her death, she had not hesitated
to cohabit with him before marriage. And was that not part and
parcel of a rich and sophisticated youth's attitude toward a poor
girl? By reason of his own early buffetings at the mood of chance
and established prosperity the idea appealed to him intensely. The
wretched rich! The indifferent rich! And here were her mother and
father obviously believing most firmly in her innocence and
virtue.</p>

<p>Further questioning of Mrs. Alden only brought out the fact that
she had never seen this particular youth, and had never even heard
of any other. The only additional data that either she or her
husband could furnish was that during her last home-coming of a
month Roberta had not been feeling at all well&mdash;drooped about
the house and rested a good deal. Also that she had written a
number of letters which she had given to the postman or placed in
the delivery box at the road-crossing below. Neither Mr. nor Mrs.
Alden knew to whom they were addressed, although the postman would
be likely to know, as Mason quickly thought. Also, during this
period, she had been busy making some dresses, at least four. And
during the latter part of her stay, she had been the recipient of a
number of telephone calls&mdash;from a certain Mr. Baker, as Titus
had heard Mr. Wilcox say. Also, on departing, she had taken only
such baggage as she had brought with her&mdash;her small trunk and
her bag. The trunk she had checked herself at the station, but just
where, other than Lycurgus, Titus could not say.</p>

<p>But now, suddenly, since he was attaching considerable
importance to the name Baker, there popped into Mason's mind:</p>

<p>"Clifford Golden! Carl Graham! Clyde Griffiths!" and at once the
identity of the intitials as well as the related euphony of the
names gave him pause. An astounding coincidence truly, if this same
Clyde Griffiths had nothing to do with this crime! Immediately he
was anxious to go direct to the mailman and question him.</p>

<p>But since Titus Alden was important not only as a witness in
identifying Roberta's body and the contents of the suitcase left by
her at Gun Lodge but also to persuade the postman to talk freely,
he now asked him to dress and accompany him, assuring him that he
would allow him to return to-morrow.</p>

<p>After cautioning Mrs. Alden to talk to no one in regard to this,
he now proceeded to the post office to question the mailman. That
individual when found, recalled, upon inquiry, and in the presence
of Titus who stood like a galvanized corpse by the side of the
district attorney, that not only had there been a few
letters&mdash;no less than twelve or fifteen even&mdash;handed him
by Roberta, during her recent stay here, but that all of them had
been addressed to some one in Lycurgus by the name of&mdash;let him
see&mdash;Clyde Griffiths&mdash;no less&mdash;care of General
Delivery there. Forthwith, the district attorney proceeded with him
to a local notary's office where a deposition was made, after which
he called his office, and learning that Roberta's body had been
brought to Bridgeburg, he drove there with as much speed as he
could attain. And once there and in the presence of the body along
with Titus, Burton Burleigh, Heit and Earl Newcomb, he was able to
decide for himself, even while Titus, half demented, gazed upon the
features of his child, first that she truly was Roberta Alden and
next as to whether he considered her of the type who would wantonly
yield herself to such a liaison as the registration at Grass Lake
seemed to indicate. He decided he did not. This was a case of sly,
evil seduction as well as murder. Oh, the scoundrel! And still at
large. Almost the political value of all this was obscured by an
angry social resentfulness against men of means in general.</p>

<p>But this particular contact with the dead, made at ten o'clock
at night in the receiving parlors of the Lutz Brothers,
Undertakers, and with Titus Alden falling on his knees by the side
of his daughter and emotionally carrying her small, cold hands to
his lips while he gazed feverishly and protestingly upon her waxy
face, framed by her long brown hair, was scarcely such as to
promise an unbiased or even legal opinion. The eyes of all those
present were wet with tears.</p>

<p>And now Titus Alden injected a new and most dramatic note into
the situation. For while the Lutz Brothers, with three of their
friends who kept an automobile shop next door, Everett Beeker, the
present representative of the Bridgeburg Republican, and Sam
Tacksun, the editor and publisher of the Democrat, awesomely gazed
over or between the heads of each other from without a side door
which gave into the Lutzs' garage, he suddenly rose and moving
wildly toward Mason, exclaimed: "I want you to find the scoundrel
who did this, Mr. District Attorney. I want him to be made to
suffer as this pure, good girl has been made to suffer. She's been
murdered&mdash;that's all. No one but a murderer would take a girl
out on a lake like that and strike her as any one can see she has
been struck." He gestured toward his dead child. "I have no money
to help prosecute a scoundrel like that. But I will work. I will
sell my farm."</p>

<p>His voice broke and seemingly he was in danger of falling as he
turned toward Roberta again. And now, Orville Mason, swept into
this father's stricken and yet retaliatory mood, pressed forward to
exclaim: "Come away, Mr. Alden. We know this is your daughter. I
swear all you gentlemen as witnesses to this identification. And if
it shall be proved that this little girl of yours was murdered, as
it now seems, I promise you, Mr. Alden, faithfully and dutifully as
the district attorney of this county, that no time or money or
energy on my part will be spared to track down this scoundrel and
hale him before the proper authorities! And if the justice of
Cataraqui County is what I think it is, you can leave him to any
jury which our local court will summon. And you won't need to sell
your farm, either."</p>

<p>Mr. Mason, because of his deep, if easily aroused, emotion, as
well as the presence of the thrilled audience, was in his most
forceful as well as his very best oratorical mood.</p>

<p>And one of the Lutz Brothers&mdash;Ed&mdash;the recipient of all
of the county coroner's business&mdash;was moved to exclaim:</p>

<p>"That's the ticket, Orville. You're the kind of a district
attorney we like." And Everett Beeker now called out: "Go to it,
Mr. Mason. We're with you to a man when it comes to that." And Fred
Heit, as well as his assistant, touched by Mason's dramatic stand,
his very picturesque and even heroic appearance at the moment, now
crowded closer, Heit to take his friend by the hand, Earl to
exclaim: "More power to you, Mr. Mason. We'll do all we can, you
bet. And don't forget that bag that she left at Gun Lodge is over
at your office. I gave it to Burton two hours ago."</p>

<p>"That's right, too. I was almost forgetting that," exclaimed
Mason, most calmly and practically at the moment, the previous
burst of oratory and emotion having by now been somehow merged in
his own mind with the exceptional burst of approval which up to
this hour he had never experienced in any case with which
previously he had been identified.</p>

<h3>Chapter 5</h3>

<p>As he proceeded to his office, accompanied by Alden and the
officials in this case, his thought was running on the motive of
this heinous crime&mdash;the motive. And because of his youthful
sexual deprivations, his mind now tended continually to dwell on
that. And meditating on the beauty and charm of Roberta, contrasted
with her poverty and her strictly moral and religious upbringing,
he was convinced that in all likelihood this man or boy, whoever he
was, had seduced her and then later, finding himself growing tired
of her, had finally chosen this way to get rid of her&mdash;this
deceitful, alleged marriage trip to the lake. And at once he
conceived an enormous personal hate for the man. The wretched rich!
The idle rich! The wastrel and evil rich&mdash;a scion or
representative of whom this young Clyde Griffiths was. If he could
but catch him.</p>

<p>At the same time it now suddenly occurred to him that because of
the peculiar circumstances attending this case&mdash;this girl
cohabiting with this man in this way&mdash;she might be pregnant.
And at once this suspicion was sufficient, not only to make him
sexually curious in regard to all the details of the life and
courtship that had led to this&mdash;but also very anxious to
substantiate for himself whether his suspicions were true.
Immediately he began to think of a suitable doctor to perform an
autopsy&mdash;if not here, then in Utica or Albany&mdash; also of
communicating to Heit his suspicions in the connection, and of
having this, as well as the import of the blows upon her face,
determined.</p>

<p>But in regard to the bag and its contents, which was the
immediate matter before him, he was fortunate in finding one
additional bit of evidence of the greatest importance. For, apart
from the dresses and hats made by Roberta, her lingerie, a pair of
red silk garters purchased at Braunstein's in Lycurgus and still in
their original box, there was the toilet set presented by Clyde to
her the Christmas before. And with it the small, plain white card,
on which Clyde had written: "For Bert from Clyde&mdash;Merry Xmas."
But no family name. And the writing a hurried scrawl, since it had
been written at a time when Clyde was most anxious to be elsewhere
than with her.</p>

<p>At once it occurred to Mason&mdash;how odd that the presence of
this toilet set in this bag, together with the card, should not
have been known to the slayer. But if it were, and he had not
removed the card, could it be possible that this same Clyde was the
slayer? Would a man contemplating murder fail to see a card such as
this, with his own handwriting on it? What sort of a plotter and
killer would that be? Immediately afterward he thought: Supposing
the presence of this card could be concealed until the day of the
trial and then suddenly produced, assuming the criminal denied any
intimacy with the girl, or having given her any toilet set? And for
the present he took the card and put it in his pocket, but not
before Earl Newcomb, looking at it carefully, had observed: "I'm
not positive, Mr. Mason, but that looks to me like the writing on
the register up at Big Bittern." And at once Mason replied: "Well,
it won't take long to establish the fact."</p>

<p>He then signaled Heit to follow him into an adjoining chamber,
where once alone with him, free from the observation and hearing of
the others, he began: "Well, Fred, you see it was just as you
thought. She did know who she was going with." (He was referring to
his own advice over the telephone from Biltz that Mrs. Alden had
provided him with definite information as to the criminal.) "But
you couldn't guess in a thousand years unless I told you." He
leaned over and looked at Heit shrewdly.</p>

<p>"I don't doubt it, Orville. I haven't the slightest idea."</p>

<p>"Well, you know of Griffiths &amp; Company, of Lycurgus?"</p>

<p>"Not the collar people?"</p>

<p>"Yes, the collar people."</p>

<p>"Not the son." Fred Heit's eyes opened wider than they had in
years. His wide, brown hand grasped the end of his beard.</p>

<p>"No, not the son. A nephew!"</p>

<p>"Nephew! Of Samuel Griffiths? Not truly!" The old,
moral-religious, politic-commercial coroner stroked his beard again
and stared.</p>

<p>"The fact seems to point that way, Fred, now at least. I'm going
down there yet to-night, though, and I hope to know a lot more
to-morrow. But this Alden girl&mdash;they're the poorest kind of
farm people, you know&mdash;worked for Griffiths &amp; Company in
Lycurgus and this nephew, Clyde Griffiths, as I understand it, is
in charge of the department in which she worked."</p>

<p>"Tst! Tst! Tst!" interjected the coroner.</p>

<p>"She was home for a month&mdash;<i>sick</i>" (he emphasized the
word) "just before she went on this trip last Tuesday. And during
that time she wrote him at least ten letters, and maybe more. I got
that from the rural delivery man. I have his affidavit here." He
tapped his coat. "All addressed to Clyde Griffiths in Lycurgus. I
even have his house number. And the name of the family with whom
she lived. I telephoned down there from Biltz. I'm going to take
the old man with me tonight in case anything comes up that he might
know about."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, Orville. I understand. I see. But a Griffiths!" And
once more he clucked with his tongue.</p>

<p>"But what I want to talk to you about is the inquest," now went
on Mason quickly and sharply. "You know I've been thinking that it
couldn't have been just because he didn't want to marry her that he
wanted to kill her. That doesn't seem reasonable to me," and he
added the majority of the thoughts that had caused him to conclude
that Roberta was pregnant. And at once Heit agreed with him.</p>

<p>"Well, then that means an autopsy," Mason resumed. "As well as
medical opinion as to the nature of those wounds. We'll have to
know beyond a shadow of a doubt, Fred, and before that body is
taken away from here, whether that girl was killed before she was
thrown out of that boat, or just stunned and then thrown out, or
the boat upset. That's very vital to the case, as you know. We'll
never be able to do anything unless we're positive about those
things. But what about the medical men around here? Do you think
any of them will be able to do all these things in a shipshape way
so that what they say will hold water in court."</p>

<p>Mason was dubious. Already he was building his case.</p>

<p>"Well, as to that, Orville," Heit replied slowly, "I can't say
exactly. You'd be a better judge, maybe, than I would. I've already
asked Dr. Mitchell to step over to-morrow and take a look at her.
Also Betts. But if there's any other doctor you'd rather
have&mdash;Bavo or Lincoln of Coldwater&mdash;how about Bavo?"</p>

<p>"I'd rather have Webster, of Utica," went on Mason, "or Beemis,
or both. Four or five opinions in a case like this won't be any too
many."</p>

<p>And Heit, sensing the importance of the great responsibility now
resting on him, added: "Well, I guess you're right, Orville. Maybe
four or five would be better than one or two. That means, though,
that the inquest will have to be postponed for a day or two more,
till we get these men here."</p>

<p>"Quite right! Quite right," went on Mason, "but that will be a
good thing, too, as long as I'm going down to Lycurgus to-night to
see what I can find out. You never can tell. I may catch up with
him. I hope so, anyhow, or if not that, then I may come upon
something that'll throw some extra light on this. For this is going
to be a big thing, Fred. I can see that&mdash;the most difficult
case that ever came my way, or yours, either,&mdash;and we can't be
too careful as to how we move from now on. He's likely to be rich,
you see, and if he is he'll fight. Besides there's that family down
there to back him up."</p>

<p>He ran a nervous hand through his shock of hair, then added:
"Well, that's all right too. The next thing to do is to get Beemis
and Webster of Utica&mdash;better wire them to-night, eh, or call
them up. And Sprull of Albany, and then, to keep peace in the
family around here, perhaps we'd better have Lincoln and Betts over
here. And maybe Bavo." He permitted himself the faintest shadow of
a smile. "In the meantime, I'll be going along, Fred. Arrange to
have them come up Monday or Tuesday, instead of to-morrow. I expect
to be back by then and if so I can be with you. If you can, better
get 'em up here, Monday&mdash;see&mdash;the quicker the
better&mdash;and we'll see what we know by then."</p>

<p>He went to a drawer to secure some extra writs. And then into
the outer room to explain to Alden the trip that was before him.
And to have Burleigh call up his wife, to whom he explained the
nature of his work and haste and that he might not be back before
Monday.</p>

<p>And all the way down to Utica, which took three hours, as well
as a wait of one hour before a train for Lycurgus could be secured,
and an additional hour and twenty minutes on that train, which set
them down at about seven, Orville Mason was busy extracting from
the broken and gloomy Titus, as best he could, excerpts from his
own as well as Roberta's humble past&mdash;her generosity, loyalty,
virtue, sweetness of heart, and the places and conditions under
which previously she had worked, and what she had received, and
what she had done with the money&mdash;a humble story which he was
quite able to appreciate.</p>

<p>Arriving at Lycurgus with Titus by his side, he made his way as
quickly as possible to the Lycurgus House, where he took a room for
the father in order that he might rest. And after that to the
office of the local district attorney, from whom he must obtain
authority to proceed, as well as an officer who would execute his
will for him here. And then being supplied with a stalwart
detective in plain clothes, he proceeded to Clyde's room in Taylor
Street, hoping against hope that he might find him there. But Mrs.
Peyton appearing and announcing that Clyde lived there but that at
present he was absent (having gone the Tuesday before to visit
friends at Twelfth Lake, she believed), he was rather painfully
compelled to announce, first, that he was the district attorney of
Cataraqui County, and, next, that because of certain suspicious
circumstances in connection with the drowning of a girl in Big
Bittern, with whom they had reason to believe that Clyde was at the
time, they would now be compelled to have access to his room, a
statement which so astonished Mrs. Peyton that she fell back, an
expression of mixed amazement, horror, and unbelief overspreading
her features.</p>

<p>"Not Mr. Clyde Griffiths! Oh, how ridiculous! Why, he's the
nephew of Mr. Samuel Griffiths and very well known here. I'm sure
they can tell you all about him at their residence, if you must
know. But anything like&mdash;oh, impossible!" And she looked at
both Mason and the local detective who was already displaying his
official badge, as though she doubted both their honesty and
authority.</p>

<p>At the same time, the detective, being all too familiar with
such circumstances, had already placed himself beyond Mrs. Peyton
at the foot of the stairs leading to the floor above. And Mason now
drew from his pocket a writ of search, which he had been careful to
secure.</p>

<p>"I am sorry, Madam, but I am compelled to ask you to show us his
room. This is a search warrant and this officer is here at my
direction." And at once struck by the futility of contending with
the law, she now nervously indicated Clyde's room, feeling still
that some insane and most unfair and insulting mistake was being
made.</p>

<p>But the two having proceeded to Clyde's room, they began to look
here and there. At once both noted one small and not very strong
trunk, locked and standing in one corner, which Mr. Faunce, the
detective, immediately began to lift to decide upon its weight and
strength, while Mason began to examine each particular thing in the
room&mdash;the contents of all drawers and boxes, as well as the
pockets of all clothes. And in the chiffonier drawers, along with
some discarded underwear and shirts and a few old invitations from
the Trumbulls, Starks, Griffiths, and Harriets, he now found a
memorandum sheet which Clyde had carried home from his desk and on
which he had written: "Wednesday, Feb. 20th, dinner at
Starks"&mdash; and below that, "Friday, 22nd, Trumbulls"&mdash;and
this handwriting Mason at once compared with that on the card in
his pocket, and being convinced by the similarity that he was in
the room of the right man, he took the invitations and then looked
toward the trunk which the detective was now contemplating.</p>

<p>"What about this, chief? Will you take it away or open it
here?"</p>

<p>"I think," said Mason solemnly, "we'd better open that right
here, Faunce. I'll send for it afterwards, but I want to see what's
in it now." And at once the detective extracted from his pocket a
heavy chisel, while he began looking around for a hammer.</p>

<p>"It isn't very strong," he said, "I think I can kick it open if
you say so."</p>

<p>At this point, Mrs. Peyton, most astounded by these
developments, and anxious to avoid any such rough procedure,
exclaimed: "You can have a hammer if you wish, but why not wait and
send for a key man? Why, I never heard of such a thing in all my
life."</p>

<p>However, the detective having secured the hammer and jarred the
lock loose, there lay revealed in a small top crate various
unimportant odds and ends of Clyde's wardrobe&mdash;socks, collars,
ties, a muffler, suspenders, a discarded sweater, a pair of not too
good high-top winter shoes, a cigarette holder, a red lacquer ash
tray, and a pair of skates. But in addition among these, in the
corner in one compact bundle, the final fifteen letters of Roberta,
written him from Biltz, together with a small picture of herself
given him the year before, as well as another small bundle
consisting of all the notes and invitations written him by Sondra
up to the time she had departed for Pine Point, The letters written
from there Clyde had taken with him&mdash;laid next his heart. And,
even more incriminating, a third bundle, consisting of eleven
letters from his mother, the first two addressed to Harry Tenet,
care of general delivery, Chicago&mdash;a most suspicious
circumstance on the surface&mdash;whereas the others of the bundle
were addressed to Clyde Griffiths, not only care of the Union
League, Chicago, but to Lycurgus.</p>

<p>Without waiting further to see what else the trunk might
contain, the district attorney began opening these and
reading&mdash;first three from Roberta, after which the reason she
had gone to Biltz was made perfectly plain&mdash;then the three
first letters from his mother, on most pathetically commonplace
stationery, as he could see, hinting at the folly of the life as
well as the nature of the accident that had driven him from Kansas
City, and at the same time advising him most solicitously and
tenderly as to the proper path for his feet in the future, the
general effect of which was to convey to a man of Mason's repressed
temperament and limited social experience the impression that from
the very beginning this individual had been of a loose, wayward and
errant character.</p>

<p>At the same time, and to his surprise, he now learned that
except for what his rich uncle might have done for him here, Clyde
was obviously of a poor, as well as highly religious, branch of the
Griffiths family, and while ordinarily this might have influenced
him in Clyde's favor a little, still now, in view of the notes of
Sondra, as well as the pathetic letters of Roberta and his mother's
reference to some earlier crime in Kansas City, he was convinced
that not only was Clyde of such a disposition as could plot such a
crime but also one who could execute it in cold blood. That crime
in Kansas City. He must wire the district attorney there for
particulars.</p>

<p>And with this thought in mind, he now scanned more briefly but
none the less sharply and critically the various notes or
invitations or love messages from Sondra, all on heavily perfumed
and monogrammed stationery, which grew more and more friendly and
intimate as the correspondence progressed, until toward the last
they invariably began:</p>

<p>"Clydie-Mydie," or "Sweetest Black Eyes," or "My sweetest boy,"
and were signed "Sonda," or "Your own Sondra." And some of them
dated so recently as May 10th, May 15th, May 26th, or up to the
very time at which, as he instantly noted, Roberta's most doleful
letters began to arrive.</p>

<p>It was all so plain, now. One secretly betrayed girl in the
background while he had the effrontery to ingratiate himself into
the affections of another, this time obviously one of much higher
social position here.</p>

<p>Although fascinated and staggered by this interesting
development, he at the same time realized that this was no hour in
which to sit meditating. Far from it. This trunk must be
transferred at once to his hotel. Later he must go forth to find
out, if he could, exactly where this individual was, and arrange
for his capture. And while he ordered the detective to call up the
police department and arrange for the transfer of the trunk to his
room at the Lycurgus House, he hurried next to the residence of
Samuel Griffiths, only to learn that no member of the family was
then in the city. They were all at Greenwood Lake. But a telephone
message to that place brought the information that in so far as
they knew, this same Clyde Griffiths, their nephew, was at the
Cranston lodge on Twelfth Lake, near Sharon, adjoining the Finchley
lodge. The name Finchley, together with the town of Sharon, being
already identified in Mason's mind with Clyde, he at once decided
that if he were still anywhere in this region, he would be
there&mdash; at the summer home perhaps of this girl who had
written him the various notes and invitations he had
seen&mdash;this Sondra Finchley. Also had not the captain of the
"Cygnus" declared that he had seen the youth who had come down from
Three Mile Bay debark there? Eureka! He had him!</p>

<p>And at once, after meditating sharply on the wisdom of his
course, he decided to proceed to Sharon and Pine Point himself. But
in the meantime being furnished with an accurate description of
Clyde, he now furnished this as well as the fact that he was wanted
for murder, not only to the district attorney and the chief of
police of Lycurgus, but to Newton Slack, the sheriff at Bridgeburg,
as well as to Heit and his own assistant, urging all three to
proceed at once to Sharon, where he would meet them.</p>

<p>At the same time, speaking as though for Mrs. Peyton, he now
called upon the long distance telephone the Cranston lodge at Pine
Point, and getting the butler on the wire, inquired whether Mr.
Clyde Griffiths chanced to be there. "Yes sir, he is, sir, but he's
not here now, sir. I think he's on a camping party farther up the
lake, sir. Any message, sir?" And in response to further inquiries,
he replied that he could not say exactly&mdash;a party had gone,
presumably, to Bear Lake some thirty miles farther up, but when it
would return he could not say&mdash;not likely before a day or two.
But distinctly this same Clyde was with that party.</p>

<p>And at once Mason recalled the sheriff at Bridgeburg,
instructing him to take four or five deputies with him so that the
searching party might divide at Sharon and seize this same Clyde
wherever he chanced to be. And throw him in jail at Bridgeburg,
where he could explain, with all due process of law, the startling
circumstances that thus far seemed to unescapably point to him as
the murderer of Roberta Alden.</p>

<h3>Chapter 6</h3>

<p>In the interim the mental state of Clyde since that hour when,
the water closing over Roberta, he had made his way to the shore,
and then, after changing his clothes, had subsequently arrived at
Sharon and the lakeside lodge of the Cranstons, was almost one of
complete mental derangement, mainly caused by fear and confusion in
his own mind as to whether he did or did not bring about her
untimely end. At the same time at the lakeside the realization that
if by any chance he were then and there found, skulking south
rather than returning north to the inn at Big Bittern to report
this seeming accident, there would be sufficient hardness and
cruelty to the look of it all to convince any one that a charge of
murder should be made against him, had fiercely tortured him. For,
as he now saw it, he really was not guilty&mdash;was he, since at
the last moment he had experienced that change of heart?</p>

<p>But who was going to believe that now, since he did not go back
to explain? And it would never do to go back now! For if Sondra
should hear that he had been on this lake with this factory
girl&mdash; that he had registered with her as husband and
wife...God!</p>

<p>And then trying to explain to his uncle afterwards, or his cold,
hard cousin&mdash;or all those smart, cynical Lycurgus people! No!
No! Having gone so far he must go on. Disaster&mdash;if not
death&mdash;lay in the opposite direction. He would have to make
the best of this terrible situation&mdash;make the best of this
plan that had ended so strangely and somewhat exculpatorily for
him.</p>

<p>And yet these woods! This approaching night. The eerie
loneliness and danger of it all now. How now to do, what to say, if
met by any one. He was so confused&mdash;mentally and nervously
sick. The crackle of a twig and he leaped forward as a hare.</p>

<p>And in this state it was that, after having recovered his bag
and changed his clothes, wringing out his wet suit and attempting
to dry it, then packing it in his bag under some dry twigs and
pine-needles and burying the tripod beneath a rotting log, that he
plunged into the woods after night had fallen. Yet meditating more
and more on his very strange and perilous position. For supposing,
just as he had unintentionally struck at her, and they had fallen
into the water and she uttered those piercing and appealing cries,
there had been some one on the shore&mdash;some one
watching&mdash;one of those strong, hardy men whom he had seen
loitering about during the day and who might even at this moment be
sounding a local alarm that would bring a score of such men to the
work of hunting for him this very night! A man hunt! And they would
take him back and no one would ever believe that he had not
intentionally struck her! They might even lynch him before he could
so much as secure a fair trial. It was possible. It had been done.
A rope around his neck. Or shot down in these woods, maybe. And
without an opportunity to explain how it had all come
about&mdash;how harried and tortured he had been by her for so
long. They would never understand that.</p>

<p>And so thinking he hurried faster and faster&mdash;as fast as
strong and serried and brambly young firs and dead branches that
cracked most ominously at times would permit, thinking always as he
went that the road to Three Mile Bay must be to his right hand, the
moon to his left when it should rise.</p>

<p>But, God, what was that?</p>

<p>Oh, that terrible sound!</p>

<p>Like a whimpering, screeching spirit in this dark!</p>

<p>There!</p>

<p>What was it?</p>

<p>He dropped his bag and in a cold sweat sunk down, crouching
behind a tall, thick tree, rigid and motionless with fear.</p>

<p>That sound!</p>

<p>But only a screech-owl! He had heard it several weeks before at
the Cranston lodge. But here! In this wood! This dark! He must be
getting on and out of here. There was no doubt of that. He must not
be thinking such horrible, fearful thoughts, or he would not be
able to keep up his strength or courage at all.</p>

<p>But that look in the eyes of Roberta! That last appealing look!
God! He could not keep from seeing it! Her mournful, terrible
screams! Could he not cease from hearing them&mdash;until he got
out of here anyhow?</p>

<p>Had she understood, when he struck her, that it was not
intentional&mdash; a mere gesture of anger and protest? Did she
know that <i>now</i>, wherever she was&mdash;in the bottom of the
lake&mdash;or here in the dark of these woods beside him, mayhap?
Ghosts! Hers. But he must get out of this&mdash;out of this! He
must&mdash;and yet the safety of these woods, too. He must not be
too brash in stepping out into any road, either. Pedestrians!
People in search of him, maybe! But did people really live after
death? Were there ghosts? And did they know the truth? Then she
must know&mdash;but how he plotted before that, too. And what would
she think of that! And was she here now reproachfully and gloomily
pursuing him with mistaken accusations, as true as it might be that
he had intended to kill her at first? He had! He had! And that was
the great sin, of course. Even though he had not killed her, yet
something had done it for him! That was true.</p>

<p>But ghosts&mdash;God&mdash;spirits that might pursue you after
they were dead, seeking to expose and punish you&mdash;seeking to
set people on your track, maybe! Who could tell? His mother had
confessed to him and Frank and Esta and Julia that she believed in
ghosts.</p>

<p>And then at last the moon, after three such hours of stumbling,
listening, waiting, perspiring, trembling. No one in sight now,
thank God! And the stars overhead&mdash;bright and yet soft, as at
Pine Point where Sondra was. If she could see him now, slipping
away from Roberta dead in that lake, his own hat upon the waters
there! If she could have heard Roberta's cries! How strange, that
never, never, never would he be able to tell her that because of
her, her beauty, his passion for her and all that she had come to
mean to him, he had been able to...to...to...well, <i>attempt</i>
this terrible thing&mdash;kill a girl whom once he had loved. And
all his life he would have this with him, now,&mdash;this thought!
He would never be able to shake it off&mdash;never, never, never.
And he had not thought of that, before. It was a terrible thing in
its way, just that, wasn't it?</p>

<p>But then suddenly there in the dark, at about eleven o'clock, as
he afterwards guessed, the water having stopped his watch, and
after he had reached the highroad to the west&mdash;and walked a
mile or two,&mdash; those three men, quick, like ghosts coming out
of the shadow of the woods. He thought at first that having seen
him at the moment he had struck Roberta or the moment afterward,
they had now come to take him. The sweating horror of that moment!
And that boy who had held up the light the better to see his face.
And no doubt he had evinced most suspicious fear and perturbation,
since at the moment he was most deeply brooding on all that had
happened, terrorized really by the thought that somehow, in some
way, he had left some clue that might lead directly to him. And he
did jump back, feeling that these were men sent to seize him. But
at that moment, the foremost, a tall, bony man, without appearing
to be more than amused at his obvious cowardice, had called,
"Howdy, stranger!" while the youngest, without appearing to be
suspicious at all, had stepped forward and then turned up the
light. And it was then that he had begun to understand that they
were just countrymen or guides&mdash;not a posse in pursuit of
him&mdash;and that if he were calm and civil they would have no
least suspicion that he was the murderer that he was.</p>

<p>But afterward he had said to himself&mdash;"But they will
remember me, walking along this lonely road at this hour with this
bag, won't they?" And so at once he had decided that he must
hurry&mdash;hurry&mdash; and not be seen by any others anywhere
there.</p>

<p>Then, hours later and just as the moon was lowering toward the
west, a sickly yellow pallor overspreading the woods and making the
night even more wretched and wearisome, he had come to Three Mile
Bay itself&mdash;a small collection of native and summer cottages
nestling at the northernmost end of what was known as the Indian
Chain. And in it, as he could see from a bend in the road, a few
pale lights still twinkling. Stores. Houses. Street lamps. But all
dim in the pale light&mdash;so dim and eerie to him. One thing was
plain&mdash;at this hour and dressed as he was and with his bag in
hand, he could not enter there. That would be to fix curiosity as
well as suspicion on him, assuredly, if any one was still about.
And as the launch that ran between this place and Sharon, from
whence he would proceed to Pine Point, did not leave until
eight-thirty, he must hide away in the meantime and make himself as
presentable as possible.</p>

<p>And accordingly re-entering a thicket of pines that descended to
the very borders of the town, there to wait until morning, being
able to tell by a small clock-face which showed upon the sides of a
small church tower, when the hour for emerging had arrived. But, in
the interim debating,&mdash;"Was it wise so to do?" For who might
not be here to wait for him? Those three men&mdash;or some one else
who might have seen?&mdash;Or an officer, notified from somewhere
else. Yet deciding after a time that it was best to go just the
same. For to stalk along in the woods west of this lake&mdash;and
by night rather than day&mdash;seeing that by day he might be seen,
and when by taking this boat he could reach in an hour and a
half&mdash;or two hours at the most&mdash;the Cranston lodge at
Sharon, whereas by walking he would not arrive until
to-morrow,&mdash;was not that unwise, more dangerous? Besides, he
had promised Sondra and Bertine that he would be there Tuesday. And
here it was Friday! Again, by tomorrow, might not a hue and cry be
on&mdash;his description sent here and there&mdash;whereas this
morning&mdash;well, how could Roberta have been found as yet? No,
no. Better this way. For who knew him here&mdash;or could identify
him as yet with either Carl Graham or Clifford Golden. Best go this
way,&mdash;speedily, before anything else in connection with her
developed. Yes, yes. And finally, the clock-hands pointing to
eight-ten, making his way out, his heart beating heavily as he did
so.</p>

<p>At the foot of this street was the launch which steamed from
here to Sharon. And as he loitered he observed the bus from
Raquette Lake approaching. It now occurred to him, if he
encountered any one he knew on the steamer dock or boat, could he
not say that he was fresh from Raquette Lake, where Sondra, as well
as Bertine, had many friends, or in case they themselves came down
on the boat, that he had been there the day before. What matter
whose name or lodge he mentioned&mdash;an invented one, if need
be.</p>

<p>And so, at last, making his way to the boat and boarding it. And
later at Sharon, leaving it again and without, as he thought,
appearing to attract any particular attention at either end. For,
although there were some eleven passengers, all strangers to him,
still no one other than a young country girl in a blue dress and a
white straw hat, whom he guessed to be from this vicinity, appeared
to pay any particular attention to him. And her glances were
admiring rather than otherwise, although sufficient, because of his
keen desire for secrecy, to cause him to retire to the rear of the
boat, whereas the others appeared to prefer the forward deck. And
once in Sharon, knowing that the majority were making for the
railway station to catch the first morning train down, he followed
briskly in their wake, only to turn into the nearest lunch-room in
order to break the trail, as he hoped. For although he had walked
the long distance from Big Bittern to Three Mile Bay, and
previously had rowed all afternoon, and merely made a pretense of
eating the lunch which Roberta had prepared at Grass Lake, still
even now he was not hungry. Then seeing a few passengers
approaching from the station, yet none whom he knew, he joined
these again as though just coming to the inn and launch from the
train.</p>

<p>For at this time there had come to him the thought that this
south train from Albany, as well as Utica being due here at this
hour, it was only natural that he should seem to come on that.
Pretending first, therefore, to be going to the station, yet
stopping en route to telephone Bertine and Sondra that he was here,
and being assured that a car rather than a launch would be sent for
him, he explained that he would be waiting on the west veranda of
the inn. En route also he stopped at a news stand for a morning
paper, although he knew there could be nothing in it as yet. And he
had barely crossed to the veranda of the inn and seated himself
before the Cranston car approached.</p>

<p>And in response to the greeting of the Cranston family
chauffeur, whom he knew well, and who smiled most welcomingly, he
was now able to achieve a seemingly easy and genial smile, though
still inwardly troubled by his great dread. For no doubt by now, as
he persistently argued with himself, the three men whom he had met
had reached Big Bittern. And by now both Roberta and he must
assuredly have been missed, and maybe, who knows, the upturned boat
with his hat and her veil discovered! If so, might they not have
already reported that they had seen such a man as himself, carrying
a bag, and making his way to the south in the night? And, if so,
would not that, regardless of whether the body was found or not,
cause them to become dubious as to whether a double drowning had
occurred? And supposing by some strange chance her body should come
to the surface? Then what? And might there not be a mark left by
that hard blow he had given her? If so, would they not suspect
murder, and his body not coming up and those men describing the man
they had seen, would not Clifford Golden or Carl Graham be
suspected of murder?</p>

<p>But neither Clifford Golden nor Carl Graham were Clyde Griffiths
by any means. And they could not possibly identify Clyde
Griffiths&mdash; with either Clifford Golden or Carl Graham. For
had he not taken every precaution, even searching through Roberta's
bag and purse there at Grass Lake while at his request after
breakfast she had gone back to see about the lunch? Had he not?
True, he had found those two letters from that girl, Theresa
Bouser, addressed to Roberta at Biltz, and he had destroyed them
before ever leaving for Gun Lodge. And as for that toilet set in
its original case, with the label "Whitely-Lycurgus" on it, while
it was true that he had been compelled to leave that, still might
not any one&mdash;Mrs. Clifford Golden, or Mrs. Carl
Graham&mdash;have bought that in Whitely's, and so without the
possibility of its being traced to him? Assuredly. And as for her
clothes, even assuming that they did go to prove her identity,
would it not be assumed, by her parents as well as others, that she
had gone on this trip with a strange man by the name of Golden or
Graham, and would they not want that hushed up without further ado?
At any rate, he would hope for the best&mdash;keep up his nerve,
put on a strong, pleasant, cheerful front here, so that no one
would think of him as the one, since he had not actually killed
her, anyhow.</p>

<p>Here he was in this fine car. And Sondra, as well as Bertine,
waiting for him. He would have to say that he was just up from
Albany&mdash;had been on some errand over there for his uncle which
had taken all of this time since Tuesday. And while he should be
blissfully happy with Sondra, still here were all of those dreadful
things of which now all of the time he would be compelled to think.
The danger that in some inadvertent way he had not quite covered
all the tracks that might lead to him. And if he had not! Exposure!
Arrest! Perhaps a hasty and unjust conviction&mdash; punishment,
even! Unless he was able to explain about that accidental blow. The
end of all his dreams in connection with
Sondra&mdash;Lycurgus&mdash;the great life that he had hoped for
himself. But could he explain as to that? Could he? God!</p>

<h3>Chapter 7</h3>

<p>From Friday morning until the following Tuesday noon, moving
amid such scenes as previously had so exhilarated and enthralled
him, Clyde was now compelled to suffer the most frightful fears and
dreads. For, although met by Sondra, as well as Bertine, at the
door of the Cranston lodge, and shown by them to the room he was to
occupy, he could not help but contrast every present delight here
with the danger of his immediate and complete destruction.</p>

<p>As he had entered, Sondra had poutingly whispered, so that
Bertine might not hear: "Baddie! Staying down there a whole week
when you might have been up here. And Sondra planning everything
for you! You ought to have a good spanking. I was going to call up
to-day to see where you were." Yet at the same time her eyes
conveying the infatuation that now dominated her.</p>

<p>And he, in spite of his troubled thoughts achieving a gay
smile,&mdash; for once in her presence even the terror of Roberta's
death, his own present danger appeared to dwindle. If only all went
well, now,&mdash;nothing were traced to him! A clear path! A
marvelous future! Her beauty! Her love! Her wealth. And yet, after
being ushered to his room, his bag having been carried in before
him, at once becoming nervous as to the suit. It was damp and
wrinkled. He must hide it on one of the upper shelves of a closet,
maybe. And the moment he was alone and the door locked, taking it
out, wet and wrinkled, the mud of the shores of Big Bittern still
about the legs&mdash;yet deciding perhaps not&mdash;perhaps he had
better keep it locked in his bag until night when he could better
decide what to do. Yet tying up in a single bundle, in order to
have them laundered, other odds and ends he had worn that day. And,
as he did so, terribly, sickeningly conscious of the mystery and
drama as well as the pathos of his life&mdash;all he had contacted
since his arrival in the east, how little he had in his youth. How
little he had now, really. The spaciousness and grandeur of this
room as contrasted with the one he occupied in Lycurgus. The
strangeness of his being here at all after yesterday. The blue
waters of this bright lake without as contrasted with the darker
ones of Big Bittern. And on the green-sward that reached from this
bright, strong, rambling house, with its wide veranda and striped
awnings to the shore of the lake itself, Stuart Finchley and Violet
Taylor, together with Frank Harriet and Wynette Phant, in the
smartest of sport clothes, playing tennis, while Bertine and Harley
Baggott tolled in the shade of a striped marquee swing.</p>

<p>And, he himself, after bathing and dressing, assuming a jocular
air although his nerves remained tense and his mood apprehensive.
And then descending to where Sondra and Burchard Taylor and Jill
Trumbull were laughing over some amusing experiences in connection
with motor-boating the day before. Jill Trumbull called to him as
he came out: "Hello, Clyde! Been playing hookey or what? I haven't
seen you in I don't know when." And he, after smiling wistfully at
Sondra, craving as never before her sympathy as well as her
affection, drawing himself up on the railing of the veranda and
replying, as smoothly as he could: "Been working over at Albany
since Tuesday. Hot down there. It's certainly fine to be up here
to-day. Who's all up?" And Jill Trumbull, smiling: "Oh, nearly
every one, I guess. I saw Vanda over at the Randalls' yesterday.
And Scott wrote Bertine he was coming to the Point next Tuesday. It
looks to me as though no one was going over to Greenwood much this
year." And then a long and intense discussion as to why Greenwood
was no longer what it had been. And then Sondra exclaiming: "That
reminds me! I have to phone Bella to-day. She promised to come up
to that horse show over at Bristol week after next, sure." And then
more talk of horses and dogs. And Clyde, listening intently in his
anxiety to seem an integral part of it all, yet brooding on all
that so desperately concerned him. Those three men. Roberta. Maybe
they had found her body by now&mdash;who could tell, yet saying to
himself&mdash;why so fearsome? Was it likely that in that depth of
water&mdash;fifty feet maybe, for all he knew&mdash;that they would
find her? Or that they could ever identify him with Clifford Golden
or Carl Graham? How could they? Hadn't he really and truly covered
his tracks except for those three men? <i>Those three men</i>! He
shivered, as with cold, in spite of himself.</p>

<p>And then Sondra, sensing a note of depression about him. (She
had determined from his obvious lack of equipment on his first
visit that perhaps the want of money was at the bottom of his
present mood, and so proposed later this day to extract
seventy-five dollars from her purse and force that upon him in
order that at no point where petty expenditures should be required,
should he feel the least bit embarrassed during his stay this
time.) And after a few moments, thinking of the short golf course,
with its variety of concealing hazards for unseen kisses and
embraces, she now jumped up with: "Who's for a mixed foursome? Come
on, Jill, Clyde, Burch! I'll bet Clyde and I can turn in a lower
card than you two can!"</p>

<p>"I'll take that!" exclaimed Burchard Taylor, rising and
straightening his yellow and blue striped sweater, "even if I
didn't get in until four this morning. How about you, Jilly? If you
want to make that for the lunches, Sonny, I'll take it."</p>

<p>And at once Clyde wincing and chilling, for he was thinking of
the miserable twenty-five dollars left him from all his recent
ghastly adventures. And a lunch for four here would cost not less
than eight or ten dollars! Perhaps more. At the same time, Sondra,
noting his expression, exclaimed: "That's a go!" and drawing near
to Clyde tapped him gently with her toe, exclaiming: "But I have to
change. I'll be right down. In the meantime, Clyde, I'll tell you
what you do&mdash;go and find Andrew and tell him to get the clubs,
will you? We can go over in your boat, can't we, Burchy?" And
Clyde, hurrying to find Andrew, and thinking of the probable cost
of the lunch if he and Sondra were defeated, but being caught up
with by Sondra and seized by the arm. "Wait a minute, honey, I'll
be right back." Then dashing up the steps to her room, and in a
moment down again, a handful of bills she had reserved shut tightly
in her little fist: "Here, darling, quick!" she whispered, taking
hold of one of Clyde's coat pockets and putting the money into it.
"Ssh! Not a word, now! Hurry! It's to pay for the lunch in case we
lose, and some other things. I'll tell you afterwards. Oh, but I do
love you, baby boy!" And then, her warm, brown eyes fixed on him
for a moment in profound admiration, dashing up the stairs again,
from where she called: "Don't stand there, silly! Get the golf
clubs! The golf clubs!" And she was gone.</p>

<p>And Clyde, feeling his pocket and realizing that she had given
him much&mdash;plenty, no doubt, for all of his needs while here,
as well as to escape if need be. And exclaiming to himself:
"Darling!" "Baby girl!" His beautiful, warm, generous Sondra! She
loved him so&mdash;truly loved him. But if ever she should find
out! Oh, God! And yet all for her, if she only knew. All for her!
And then finding Andrew and returning with him carrying the
bags.</p>

<p>And here was Sondra again, dancing down in a smart green knitted
sports costume. And Jill in a new cap and blouse which made her
look like a jockey, laughing at Burchard who was at the wheel of
the boat. And Sondra calling back to Bertine and Harley Baggott in
the swing as she was passing: "Hey, fellows! You won't come,
eh?"</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"Casino Golf Club."</p>

<p>"Oh, too far. See you after lunch on the beach, though."</p>

<p>And then Burchard shooting the boat out in the lake with a whir
that set it bounding like a porpoise&mdash;and Clyde gazing half in
a dream, half delight and hope and the other half a cloud of shadow
and terror, with arrest and death, maybe, stalking close behind.
For in spite of all his preliminary planning, he was beginning to
feel that he had made a mistake in openly coming out of the wood
this morning. And yet had it not been best, since the only
alternative was that of remaining there by day and coming out at
night and following the shore road on foot to Sharon? That would
have required two or three days. And Sondra, anxious as well as
curious about the delay, might have telephoned to Lycurgus, thereby
raising some question in regard to him which might have proved
dangerous later might it not?</p>

<p>But here now, this bright day, with seemingly no cares of any
kind, for these others at least, however dark and bleak his own
background might be. And Sondra, all gayety because of his
presence, now jumping up, her bright scarf held aloft in one hand
like a pennant, and exclaiming foolishly and gayly: "Cleopatra
sailing to meet&mdash;to meet&mdash;who was it she was sailing to
meet, anyhow?"</p>

<p>"Charlie Chaplin," volunteered Taylor, at the same time
proceeding to ricochet the boat as roughly and erratically as
possible in order to make her lose her balance.</p>

<p>"Oh, you silly!" returned Sondra, spreading her feet
sufficiently apart to maintain her equilibrium, and adding for the
benefit of Burchard: "No, you don't either, Burchy," then
continuing: "Cleopatra sailing, a-a-oh, I know, aquaplaning," and
throwing her head back and her arms wide, while the boat continued
to jump and lurch like a frightened horse.</p>

<p>"See if you can upset me now, Burchy," she called.</p>

<p>And Burchard, throwing the boat from side to side as swiftly as
he dared, with Jill Trumbull, anxious for her own safety, calling:
"Oh, say, what do you want to do? Drown us all?" at which Clyde
winced and blanched as though struck.</p>

<p>At once he felt sick, weak. He had never imagined that it was
going to be like this; that he was going to suffer so. He had
imagined that it was all going to be different. And yet here he
was, blanching at every accidental and unintended word! Why, if he
were put to any real test&mdash;an officer descending on him
unexpectedly and asking him where he had been yesterday and what he
knew of Roberta's death&mdash;why, he would mumble, shiver, not be
able to talk, maybe&mdash;and so give his whole case away wouldn't
he! He must brace up, try to look natural, happy&mdash;mustn't
he&mdash;for this first day at least.</p>

<p>Fortunately in the speed and excitement of the play, the others
seemed not to notice the startling effect of the remark upon him,
and he managed by degrees to recover his outward composure. Then
the launch approached the Casino and Sondra, wishing to execute
some last showy stunt, jumped up and catching the rail pulled
herself up, while the boat rolled past only to reverse later. And
Clyde, because of a happy smile in his direction, was seized by an
uncontrollable desire for her&mdash;her love, sympathy, generosity,
courage. And so now, to match her smiles, he jumped up and after
assisting Jill to the steps, quickly climbed up after her,
pretending a gayety and enthusiasm that was as hollow inwardly as
outwardly it was accurate.</p>

<p>"Gee! Some athlete you are!"</p>

<p>And then on the links a little later with her, and under her
guidance and direction, playing as successful a game as it was
possible with his little experience and as troubled as he was. And
she, because of the great delight of having him all to herself in
shadowy hazards where they might kiss and embrace, beginning to
tell him of a proposed camping trip which she, Frank Harriet,
Wynette Phant, Burchard Taylor, her brother Stuart, Grant Cranston
and Bertine, as well as Harley Baggott, Perley Haynes, Jill
Trumbull and Violet Taylor, had been organizing for a week, and
which was to begin on the morrow afternoon, with a motor trip
thirty miles up the lake and then forty miles east to a lake known
as Bear, along which, with tents and equipment, they were to canoe
to certain beaches and scenes known only to Harley and Frank.
Different days, different points. The boys would kill squirrels and
catch fish for food. Also there would be moonlight trips to an inn
that could be reached by boat, so they said. A servant or two or
three from different homes was to accompany them, as well as a
chaperon or two. But, oh, the walks in the woods! The opportunities
for love&mdash;canoe trips on the lake&mdash;hours of uninterrupted
love-making for at least a week!</p>

<p>In spite of all that had occurred thus far to give him pause, he
could not help thinking that whatever happened, was it not best to
go? How wonderful to have her love him so! And what else here could
he do? It would take him out of this, would it not&mdash;farther
and farther from the scene of the&mdash;of the&mdash;accident and
in case any one were looking for any one who looked like him, for
instance&mdash;well, he would not be around where he could be seen
and commented upon. <i>Those three men</i>.</p>

<p>Yet, as it now instantly occurred to him, under no circumstances
must he leave here without first finding out as definitely as
possible whether any one was as yet suspected. And once at the
Casino, and for the moment left alone, he learned on inquiring at
the news stand that there would be no Albany, Utica, or any local
afternoon paper there until seven or seven-thirty. He must wait
until then to know.</p>

<p>And so although after the lunch there was swimming and dancing,
then a return to the Cranstons with Harley Baggott and
Bertine&mdash; Sondra going to Pine Point, with an agreement to
meet him afterwards at the Harriets' for dinner&mdash;still his
mind was on the business of getting these papers at the first
possible opportunity. Yet unless, as he now saw, he was so
fortunate as to be able to stop on his way from the Cranstons' to
the Harriets' and so obtain one or all, he must manage to come over
to this Casino in the morning before leaving for Bear Lake. He must
have them. He must know what, if anything, was either being said or
done so far in regard to that drowned couple.<br>
<br></p>

<p>But on his way to Harriets' he was not able to get the papers.
They had not come. And none at the Harriets' either, when he first
arrived. Yet sitting on the veranda about a half hour later,
talking with the others although brooding as to all this, Sondra
herself appeared and said: "Oh, say, people! I've got something to
tell you. Two people were drowned this morning or yesterday up at
Big Bittern, so Blanche Locke was telling me just now over the
phone. She's up at Three Mile Bay today and she says they've found
the body of the girl but not the man yet. They were drowned in the
south part of the lake somewhere, she said."</p>

<p>At once Clyde sat up, rigid and white, his lips a bloodless
line, his eyes fixed not on anything here but rather the distant
scene at Big Bittern&mdash;the tall pines, the dark water closing
over Roberta. Then they had found her body. And now would they
believe that his body was down there, too, as he had planned? But,
listen! He must hear in spite of his dizziness.</p>

<p>"Gee, that's tough!" observed Burchard Taylor, stopping his
strumming on a mandolin. "Anybody we know?"</p>

<p>"She says she didn't hear yet."</p>

<p>"I never did like that lake," put in Frank Harriet. "It's too
lonely. Dad and I and Mr. Randall were up there fishing last
summer, but we didn't stay long. It's too gloomy."</p>

<p>"We were up there three weeks ago&mdash;don't you remember,
Sondra?" added Harley Baggott. "You didn't care for it."</p>

<p>"Yes, I remember," replied Sondra. "A dreadfully lonely place. I
can't imagine any one wanting to go up there for anything."</p>

<p>"Well, I only hope it isn't any one we know from around here,"
added Burchard, thoughtfully. "It would put a crimp in the fun
around here for a while, anyhow."</p>

<p>And Clyde unconsciously wet his dry lips with his tongue and
swallowed to moisten his already dry throat.</p>

<p>"I don't suppose any of to-day's papers would have anything
about it yet. Has any one looked?" inquired Wynette Phant, who had
not heard Sondra's opening remark.</p>

<p>"There ain't no papers," commented Burchard Taylor. "Besides,
it's not likely yet, didn't Sondra say she just heard it from
Blanche Locke over the phone? She's up near there."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, that's right."</p>

<p>And yet might not that small local afternoon paper of
Sharon&mdash;The Banner, wasn't it&mdash;have something as to this?
If only he could see it yet to-night!</p>

<p>But another thought! For Heaven's sake! It came to him now for
the first time. His footprints! Were there any in the mud of that
shore? He had not even stopped to look, climbing out so hastily as
he did. And might there not have been? And then would they not know
and proceed to follow him&mdash;the man those three men saw?
Clifford Golden! That ride down this morning. His going out to the
Cranstons' in their car. That wet suit over in the room at the
Cranstons'! Had any one in his absence been in his room as yet to
look, examine, inquire&mdash;open his bag, maybe? An officer? God!
It was there in his bag. But why in his bag or anywhere else near
him now? Why had he not hidden it before this&mdash;thrown it in
the lake here, maybe, with a stone in it? That would keep it down.
God! What was he thinking in the face of such a desperate situation
as this? Supposing he did need the suit!</p>

<p>He was now up, standing&mdash;mentally and physically frozen
really&mdash;his eyes touched with a stony glaze for the moment. He
must get out of here. He must go back there, at once, and dispose
of that suit&mdash; drop it in the lake&mdash;hide it somewhere in
those woods beyond the house! And yet&mdash;he could not do that so
swiftly, either&mdash;leave so instantly after this light
conversation about the drowning of those two people. How would that
look?</p>

<p>And as instantly there came the thought&mdash;no&mdash;be
calm&mdash;show no trace of excitement of any kind, if you can
manage it&mdash;appear cool&mdash;make some unimportant remark, if
you can.</p>

<p>And so now, mustering what nervous strength he had, and drawing
near to Sondra, he said: "Too bad, eh?" Yet in a voice that for all
its thinly-achieved normality was on the borderline of shaking and
trembling. His knees and his hands, also.</p>

<p>"Yes, it certainly is," replied Sondra, turning to him alone
now. "I always hate to hear of anything like that, don't you?
Mother worries so about Stuart and me fooling around these lakes as
it is."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know." His voice was thick and heavy. He could scarcely
form the words. They were smothered, choked. His lips tightened to
a thinner white line than before. His face grew paler still.</p>

<p>"Why, what's the matter, Clydie?" Sondra asked, of a sudden,
looking at him more closely. "You look so pale! Your eyes. Anything
wrong? Aren't you feeling well tonight, or is it this light out
here?"</p>

<p>She turned to look at some of the others in order to make sure,
then back at him. And he, feeling the extreme importance of looking
anything but the way she was describing him now drew himself up as
best he could, and replied: "Oh, no. It must be the light, I guess.
Sure, it's the light. I had&mdash;a&mdash;a hard day yesterday,
that's all. I shouldn't have come over to-night, I suppose." And
then achieving the weirdest and most impossible of smiles. And
Sondra, gazing most sympathetically, adding: "Was he so tired? My
Clydie-mydie boy, after his work yesterday. Why didn't my baby boy
tell me that this morning instead of doing all that we did today?
Want me to get Frank to run you down to the Cranstons' now? Or
maybe you'd like to go up in his room and lie down? He won't mind,
I know. Shall I ask him?"</p>

<p>She turned as if to speak to Frank, but Clyde, all but
panic-stricken by this latest suggestion, and yet angling for an
excuse to leave, exclaimed earnestly and yet shakily: "Please,
please don't, darling. I&mdash;I&mdash;don't want you to. I'll be
all right. I'll go up after a bit if I want to, or maybe home a
little early, if you're going after a while, but not now. I'm not
feeling as good as I should, but I'll be all right."</p>

<p>Sondra, because of his strained and as she now fancied almost
peevish tone, desisted with: "All right, honey. All right. But if
you don't feel well, I wish you would let me get Frank to take you
down or go upstairs. He won't mind. And then after a while&mdash;
about ten-thirty&mdash;I'll excuse myself and you can go down with
me to your place. I'll take you there before I go home and whoever
else wants to go. Won't my baby boy do something like that?"</p>

<p>And Clyde saying: "Well, I think I'll go up and get a drink,
anyhow." And disappearing in one of the spacious baths of the
Harriet home, locking the door and sitting down and thinking,
thinking&mdash;of Roberta's body recovered, of the possibilities of
a bruise of some kind, of the possibility of the print of his own
feet in the mud and sandy loam of the shore; of that suit over at
the Cranstons', the men in the wood, Roberta's bag, hat and coat,
his own liningless hat left on the water&mdash;and wondering what
next to do. How to act! How to talk! Whether to go downstairs to
Sondra now and persuade her to go, or whether to stay and suffer
and agonize? And what would the morrow's papers reveal? What? What?
And was it wise, in case there was any news which would make it
look as though eventually he was to be sought after, or in any way
connected with this, to go on that proposed camping trip tomorrow!
Or, wiser, to run away from here? He had some money now. He could
go to New York, Boston, New Orleans where Ratterer was&mdash;but
oh, no&mdash;not where any one knew him.</p>

<p>Oh, God! The folly of all his planning in connection with all
this to date! The flaws! Had he ever really planned it right from
the start? Had he ever really imagined, for instance, that
Roberta's body would be found in that deep water? And yet, here it
was&mdash; risen so soon&mdash;this first day&mdash;to testify
against him! And although he had signed as he had on those
registers up there, was it not possible now, on account of those
three men and that girl on that boat, for him to be traced? He must
think, think, think! And get out of here as soon as possible,
before anything really fatal in connection with that suit should
happen.</p>

<p>Growing momentarily weaker and more terrorized, he now decided
to return to Sondra below, and say that he was really feeling quite
sick and that if she did not object he would prefer to go home with
her, if she could arrange it. And consequently, at ten-thirty, when
the evening still had hours to go, Sondra announced to Burchard
that she was not feeling well and would he run her and Clyde and
Jill down to her place, but that she would see them all on the
morrow in time for the proposed departure for Bear Lake.</p>

<p>And Clyde, though brooding as to whether this early leaving on
his part was not another of those wretched errors which had seemed
to mark every step of this desperate and murderous scheme so far,
finally entering the swift launch and being raced to the Cranston
lodge in no time. And once there, excusing himself to Burchard and
Sondra as nonchalantly and apologetically as might be, and then
hurrying to his own room only to find the suit as he had left
it&mdash; no least evidence that any one had been there to disturb
the serenity of his chamber. Just the same, nervously and
suspiciously, he now took it out and tied it up, and then waiting
and listening for a silent moment in which to slip from the house
unobserved&mdash; finally ambled out as though going for a short
walk. And then, by the shore of the lake&mdash;about a quarter of a
mile distant from the house&mdash;seeking out a heavy stone and
tying the suit to that. And then throwing it out into the water, as
far as his strength would permit. And then returning, as silently
and gloomily and nervously as he had gone, and brooding and
brooding as to what the morrow might reveal and what, if any
appeared to question him, he would say.</p>

<h3>Chapter 8</h3>

<p>The morrow dawned after an all but sleepless night, harrowed by
the most torturesome dreams in regard to Roberta, men who arrived
to arrest him, and the hike, until at last he arose, his nerves and
eyes aching. Then, venturing to come downstairs about an hour
later, he saw Frederick, the chauffeur who had driven him out the
day before, getting one of the cars out. And thereupon instructing
him to bring all the morning Albany and Utica papers. And about
nine-thirty, when he returned, proceeding to his room with them,
where, locking the door and spreading one of the papers before him,
he was immediately confronted by the startling headlines:</p>

<blockquote>"MYSTERY IN GIRL'S DEATH<br>
BODY FOUND YESTERDAY IN ADIRONDACK LAKE<br>
MAN COMPANION MISSING"</blockquote>

<p>And at once strained and white he sat down in one of the chairs
near the window and began to read:</p>

<blockquote>"Bridgeburg, N. Y., July 9.&mdash;The body of an
unknown girl, presumably the wife of a young man who registered
first on Wednesday morning at Grass Lake Inn, Grass Lake, N. Y., as
Carl Graham and wife, and later, Thursday noon, at Big Bittern
Lodge, Big Bittern, as Clifford Golden and wife was taken from the
waters of the south end of Big Bittern just before noon yesterday.
Because of an upturned boat, as well as a man's straw hat found
floating on the water in Moon Cove, dredging with hooks and lines
had been going on all morning...Up to seven o'clock last evening,
however, the body of the man had not as yet been recovered, and
according to Coroner Heit of Bridgeburg, who by two o'clock had
been summoned to the scene of the tragedy, it was not considered at
all likely that it would be. Several marks and abrasions found upon
the dead girl's head and face, as well as the testimony of three
men who arrived on the scene while the search was still on and
testified to having met a young man who answered to the description
of Golden or Graham in the woods to the south of the lake the night
before, caused many to conclude that a murder had been committed
and that the murderer was seeking to make his escape.<br>
<br>
"The girl's brown leather traveling bag, as well as a hat and coat
belonging to her, were left, the bag in the ticket agent's room at
Gun Lodge, which is the railway station five miles east of Big
Bittern, and the hat and coat in the coatroom of the inn at the
Lake, whereas Graham or Golden is said to have taken his suitcase
with him into the boat.<br>
<br>
"According to the innkeeper at Big Bittern, the couple on their
arrival registered as Clifford Golden and wife of Albany. They
remained in the inn but a few minutes before Golden walked to the
boat-landing just outside and procured a light boat, in which,
accompanied by the girl and his suitcase, he went out on the lake.
They did not return, and yesterday morning the boat was found
bottomside up in what is known as Moon Cove, a small bay or
extension at the extreme south end of the lake, from the waters of
which soon afterwards the body of the young woman was recovered. As
there are no known rocks in the lake at that point, and the wounds
upon the face are quite marked, suspicion was at once aroused that
the girl might have been unfairly dealt with. This, together with
the testimony of the three men, as well as the fact that a man's
straw hat found nearby contained no lining or other method of
identification, has caused Coroner Heit to assert that unless the
body of the man is found he will assume that murder has been
committed.<br>
<br>
"Golden or Graham, as described by innkeepers and guests and guides
at Grass Lake and Big Bittern, is not more than twenty-four or
twenty-five years of age, slender, dark, and not more than five
feet eight or nine inches tall. At the time he arrived he was
dressed in a light gray suit, tan shoes, and a straw hat and
carried a brown suitcase to which was attached an umbrella and some
other object, presumably a cane.<br>
<br>
"The hat and coat left by the girl at the inn were of dark and
light tan respectively, her dress a dark blue.<br>
<br>
"Notice has been sent to all railroad stations in this vicinity to
be on the lookout for Golden, or Graham, in order that he may be
arrested if he is alive and attempts to make his escape. The body
of the drowned girl is to be removed to Bridgeburg, the county seat
of this county, where an inquest is later to be held."</blockquote>

<p>In frozen silence he sat and pondered. For would not the news of
such a dastardly murder as this now appeared to be, together with
the fact that it had been committed in this immediate vicinity,
stir up such marked excitement as to cause many&mdash;perhaps
all&mdash;to scan all goers and comers everywhere in the hope of
detecting the one who had thus been described? Might it not be
better, therefore, since they were so close on his trail already,
if he were to go to the authorities at Big Bittern or here and make
a clean breast of all that had thus far occurred, the original plot
and the reasons therefor, only explaining how at the very last he
had not really killed her&mdash;had experienced a change of heart
and had not been able to do as he had planned? But, no. That would
be to give away to Sondra and the Griffiths all that had been going
on between him and Roberta&mdash;and before it was absolutely
certain that all was ended for him here. And besides, would they
believe him now, after that flight&mdash;those reported wounds? Did
it not really look as though he had killed her, regardless of how
he might try to explain that he had not?</p>

<p>It was not unlikely also that at least some among all those who
had seen him would be able to detect him from this printed
description, even though he no longer wore the gray suit or the
straw hat. God! They were looking for him, or rather for that
Clifford Golden or Carl Graham who looked like him, in order to
charge him with murder! But if he looked exactly like Clifford
Golden and those three men came! He began to shiver. And worse yet.
A new and horrible thought, this&mdash;and at this instant, and for
the first time flashing upon his mind&mdash;the similarity of those
initials to his own! He had never thought of them in an unfavorable
light before, but now he could see that they were detrimental. Why
was it that he had never thought of that before? Why was it? Why
was it? Oh, God!</p>

<p>Just then a telephone call for him came from Sondra. It was
announced as from her. Yet even so he was compelled to brace
himself in order to make even an acceptable showing, vocally. How
was her sick boy this morning? Any better? How dreadful that
illness last night to come on him so suddenly. Was he really all
right now? And was he going to be able to go on the trip all right?
That was fine. She had been so frightened and so worried all night
for fear he might be too sick to want to go. But he was going, so
everything was all right again now. Darling! Precious baby! Did her
baby boy love her so? She was just sure that the trip would do him
a lot of good. But until noon, now, dear, she would be using all
her spare time getting ready, but at one, or one-thirty, everybody
would be at the Casino pier. And then&mdash;oh, my! Ho! for a great
old time up there! He was to come with Bertine and Grant and
whoever else was coming from there, and then at the pier he could
change to Stuart's launch. They were certain to have so much
fun&mdash;just loads of it&mdash;but just now she would have to go.
Bye-bye!</p>

<p>And once more like a bright-colored bird she was gone.</p>

<p>But three hours to wait before he could leave here and so avoid
the danger of encountering any one who might be looking for
Clifford Golden or Carl Graham! Still until then he could walk up
the lake shore into the woods, couldn't he?&mdash;or sit below, his
bag all packed, and watch who, if anybody, might approach along the
long-winding path from the road or by launch across the lake. And
if he saw any one who looked at all suspicious, he could take
flight, could he not? And afterwards doing just that&mdash;first
walking away into the woods and looking back, as might a hunted
animal. Then later returning and sitting or walking, but always
watching, watching. (What man was that? What boat was that? Where
was it going? Was it coming here, by any chance? Who was in it?
Supposing an officer&mdash;a detective? Then flight, of
course&mdash;if there was still time.)</p>

<p>But, at last one o'clock, and the Cranston launch, with Bertine
and Harley and Wynette, as well as Grant and himself, setting out
for the pier. And once there, joined by all who were going,
together with the servants. And at Little Fish Inlet, thirty miles
north, on the eastern shore, they were met by the cars of the
Baggotts, Harriets and others, from where, with their goods and
canoes, they were portaged forty miles east to Bear Lake, as lonely
and as arresting almost as Big Bittern itself.</p>

<p>The joy of this trip if only that other thing were not hanging
over him now. This exquisite pleasure of being near Sondra, her
eyes constantly telling him how much she cared. And her spirit's
flame so high because of his presence here with her now. And yet
Roberta's body up! That search for Clifford Golden&mdash;Carl
Graham. His identical description wired as well as published
everywhere. These others&mdash;all of them in their boats and cars
had probably read it. And yet, because of their familiarity with
him and his connections&mdash;Sondra, the Griffiths&mdash;not
suspecting him&mdash;not thinking of the description even. But if
they should! If they should guess! The horror! The flight! The
exposure! The police! The first to desert him&mdash;these&mdash;all
save Sondra perhaps. And even she, too. Yes, she, of course. The
horror in her eyes.</p>

<p>And then that evening at sundown, on the west shore of this same
lake, on an open sward that was as smooth as any well-kept lawn,
the entire company settled, in five different colored tents ranged
about a fire like an Indian village, with cooks' and servants'
tents in the distance. And the half dozen canoes beached like
bright fish along the grassy shore of the lake. And then supper
around an open fire. And Baggott and Harriet and Stuart and Grant,
after furnishing music for the others to dance by, organizing by
the flare of a large gasoline lamp, a poker game. And the others
joining in singing ribald camping and college songs, no one of
which Clyde knew, yet in which he tried to join. And shouts of
laughter. And bets as to who would be the first to catch the first
fish, to shoot the first squirrel or partridge, to win the first
race. And lastly, solemn plans for moving the camp at least ten
miles farther east, after breakfast, on the morrow where was an
ideal beach, and where they would be within five miles of the
Metissic Inn, and where they could dine and dance to their heart's
content.</p>

<p>And then the silence and the beauty of this camp at night, after
all had presumably gone to bed. The stars! The mystic, shadowy
water, faintly rippling in a light wind, the mystic, shadowy pines
conferring in the light breezes, the cries of night birds and
owls&mdash; too disturbing to Clyde to be listened to with anything
but inward distress. The wonder and glory of all this&mdash;if
only&mdash;if only he were not stalked after, as by a skeleton, by
the horror not only of what he had done in connection with Roberta
but the danger and the power of the law that deemed him a murderer!
And then Sondra, the others having gone to bed&mdash;or off into
the shadow,&mdash;stealing out for a few last words and kisses
under the stars. And he whispering to her how happy he was, how
grateful for all her love and faith, and at one point almost
tempted to ask whether in case it should ever appear that he was
not as good as she now seemed to imagine him, she would still love
him a little&mdash;not hate him entirely&mdash;yet refraining for
fear that after that exhibition of terror the preceding night she
might connect his present mood with that, or somehow with the
horrible, destructive secret that was gnawing at his vitals.</p>

<p>And then afterwards, lying in the four-cot tent with Baggott,
Harriet and Grant, listening nervously for hours for any prowling
steps that might mean&mdash;that might mean&mdash;God&mdash;what
might they not mean even up here?&mdash;the law! arrest! exposure!
Death. And waking twice in the night out of dread, destructive
dreams,&mdash;and feeling as though&mdash;and fearing&mdash;that he
had cried out in his sleep.</p>

<p>But then the glory of the morning once more&mdash;with its
rotund and yellow sun rising over the waters of the lake&mdash;and
in a cove across the lake wild ducks paddling about. And after a
time Grant and Stuart and Harley, half-clad and with guns and a
great show of fowling skill, foolishly setting forth in canoes in
the hope of bagging some of the game with long distance shots, yet
getting nothing, to the merriment of all the others. And the boys
and girls, stealing out in bright-colored bathing suits and silken
beach robes to the water, there to plunge gayly in and shout and
clatter concerning the joy of it all. And breakfast at nine, with
afterwards the gayety and beauty of the bright flotilla of canoes
making eastward along the southern lake shore, banjos, guitars and
mandolins strumming and voices raised in song, jest, laughter.</p>

<p>"Whatever matter wissum sweet to-day? Face all dark. Cantum be
happy out here wis Sondra and all these nicey good-baddies?"</p>

<p>And Clyde as instantly realizing that he must pretend to be gay
and care-free.</p>

<p>And then Harley Baggott and Grant and Harriet at about noon
announcing that there&mdash;just ahead&mdash;was the fine beach
they had in mind&mdash;the Ramshorn, a spit of Land commanding from
its highest point all the length and breadth of the lake. And with
room on the shore below for all the tents and paraphernalia of the
company. And then, throughout this warm, pleasant Sunday afternoon,
the usual program of activities&mdash;lunching, swimming, dancing,
walking, card-playing, music. And Clyde and Sondra, like other
couples, stealing off&mdash;Sondra with a mandolin&mdash;to a
concealed rock far to the east of the camp, where in the shade of
the pines they could lie&mdash;Sondra in Clyde's arms&mdash;and
talk of the things they were certain to do later, even though, as
she now announced, Mrs. Finchley was declaring that after this
particular visit of Clyde's her daughter was to have nothing more
to do with him in any such intimate social way as this particular
trip gave opportunity for. He was too poor&mdash;too nondescript a
relative of the Griffiths. (It was so that Sondra, yet in a more
veiled way, described her mother as talking.) Yet adding: "How
ridiculous, sweetum! But don't you mind. I just laughed and agreed
because I don't want to aggravate her just now. But I did ask her
how I was to avoid meeting you here or anywhere now since you are
as popular as you are. My sweetum is so good-looking. Everybody
thinks so&mdash;even the boys."<br>
<br></p>

<p>At this very hour, on the veranda of the Silver Inn at Sharon,
District Attorney Mason, with his assistant Burton Burleigh,
Coroner Heit and Earl Newcomb, and the redoubtable Sheriff Slack,
paunched and scowling, yet genial enough in ordinary social
intercourse, together with three assistants&mdash;first, second and
third deputies Kraut, Sissel and Swenk&mdash;conferring as to the
best and most certain methods of immediate capture.</p>

<p>"He has gone to Bear Lake. We must follow and trap him before
news reaches him in any way that he is wanted."</p>

<p>And so they set forth&mdash;this group&mdash;Burleigh and Earl
Newcomb about Sharon itself in order to gather such additional data
as they might in connection with Clyde's arrival and departure from
here for the Cranstons' on Friday, talking with and subpoenaing any
such individuals as might throw any light on his movements; Heit to
Three Mile Bay on much the same errand, to see Captain Mooney of
the "Cygnus" and the three men and Mason, together with the sheriff
and his deputies, in a high-powered launch chartered for the
occasion, to follow the now known course of the only
recently-departed camping party, first to Little Fish Inlet and
from there, in case the trail proved sound, to Bear Lake.</p>

<p>And on Monday morning, while those at Ramshorn Point after
breaking camp were already moving on toward Shelter Beach fourteen
miles east, Mason, together with Slack and his three deputies,
arriving at the camp deserted the morning before. And there, the
sheriff and Mason taking counsel with each other and then dividing
their forces so that in canoes commandeered from lone residents of
the region they now proceeded, Mason and First Deputy Kraut along
the south shore, Slack and Second Deputy Sissel along the north
shore, while young Swenk, blazing with a desire to arrest and
handcuff some one, yet posing for the occasion as a lone young
hunter or woodsman, paddled directly east along the center of the
lake in search of any informing smoke or fires or tents or
individuals idling along the shores. And with great dreams of being
the one to capture the murderer&mdash;I arrest you, Clyde
Griffiths, in the name of the law!&mdash;yet because of
instructions from Mason, as well as Slack, grieving that instead,
should he detect any signs, being the furthermost outpost, he must,
in order to avoid frightening the prey or losing him, turn on his
track and from some point not so likely to be heard by the criminal
fire one single shot from his eight-chambered repeater, whereupon
whichever party chanced to be nearest would fire one shot in reply
and then proceed as swiftly as possible in his direction. But under
no circumstances was he to attempt to take the criminal alone,
unless noting the departure by boat or on foot of a suspicious
person who answered the description of Clyde.</p>

<p>At this very hour, Clyde, with Harley Baggott, Bertine and
Sondra, in one of the canoes, paddling eastward along with the
remainder of the flotilla, looking back and wondering. Supposing by
now, some officer or some one had arrived at Sharon and was
following him up here? For would it be hard to find where he had
gone, supposing only that they knew his name?</p>

<p>But they did not know his name. Had not the items in the papers
proved that? Why worry so always, especially on this utterly
wonderful trip and when at last he and Sondra could be together
again? And besides, was it not now possible for him to wander off
by himself into these thinly populated woods along the shore to the
eastward, toward that inn at the other end of the lake&mdash;and
not return? Had he not inquired most casually on Saturday afternoon
of Harley Baggott as well as others as to whether there was a road
south or east from the east end of the lake? And had he not learned
there was?</p>

<p>And at last, at noon, Monday, reaching Shelter Beach, the third
spot of beauty contemplated by the planners of this outing, where
he helped to pitch the tents again while the girls played
about.</p>

<p>Yet at the same hour, at the Ramshorn site, because of the ashes
from their fires left upon the shore, young Swenk, most eagerly and
enthusiastically, like some seeking animal, approaching and
examining the same and then going on&mdash;swiftly. And but one
hour later, Mason and Kraut, reconnoitering the same spot, but
without either devoting more than a cursory glance, since it was
obvious that the prey had moved farther on.</p>

<p>But then greater speed in paddling on the part of Swenk, until
by four he arrived at Shelter Beach. And then, descrying as many as
a half dozen people in the water in the distance, at once turning
and retreating in the direction of the others in order to give the
necessary signal. And some two miles back firing one shot, which in
its turn was responded to by Mason as well as Sheriff Slack. Both
parties had heard and were now paddling swiftly east.</p>

<p>At once Clyde in the water&mdash;near Sondra&mdash;hearing this
was made to wonder. The ominous quality of that first shot!
Followed by those two additional signals&mdash;farther away, yet
seemingly in answer to the first! And then the ominous silence
thereafter! What was that? And with Harley Baggott jesting: "Listen
to the guys shooting game out of season, will you. It's against the
law, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Hey, you!" Grant Cranston shouted. "Those are my ducks down
there! Let 'em alone."</p>

<p>"If they can't shoot any better than you, Granty, they will let
'em alone." This from Bertine.</p>

<p>Clyde, while attempting to smile, looked in the direction of the
sound and listened like a hunted animal.</p>

<p>What was it now that urged him to get out of the water and dress
and run? Hurry! Hurry! To your tent! To the woods, quick! Until at
last heeding this, and while most of the others were not looking,
hurrying to his tent, changing to the one plain blue business suit
and cap that he still possessed, then slipping into the woods back
of the camp&mdash;out of sight and hearing of all present until he
should be able to think and determine, but keeping always safely
inland out of the direct view of the water, for fear&mdash;for
fear&mdash;who could tell exactly what those shots meant?</p>

<p>Yet Sondra! And her words of Saturday and yesterday and to-day.
Could he leave her in this way, without being sure? Could he? Her
kisses! Her dear assurances as to the future! What would she think
now&mdash;and those others&mdash;in case he did not go back? The
comment which was certain to be made in the Sharon and other papers
in regard to this disappearance of his, and which was certain to
identify him with this same Clifford Golden or Carl Graham! was it
not?</p>

<p>Then reflecting also&mdash;the possible groundlessness of these
fears, based on nothing more, maybe, than the chance shots of
passing hunters on the lake or in these woods. And then pausing and
debating with himself whether to go on or not. Yet, oh, the comfort
of these tall, pillared trees&mdash;the softness and silence of
these brown, carpeting needles on the ground&mdash;the clumps and
thickets of underbrush under which one could lie and hide until
night should fall again. And then on&mdash;and on. But turning,
none-the-less, with the intention of returning to the camp to see
whether any one had come there. (He might say he had taken a walk
and got lost in the woods.)</p>

<p>But about this time, behind a protecting group of trees at least
two miles west of the camp, a meeting and conference between Mason,
Slack and all the others. And later, as a result of this and even
as Clyde lingered and returned somewhat nearer the camp, Mason,
Swenk paddling the canoe, arriving and inquiring of those who were
now on shore if a Mr. Clyde Griffiths was present and might he see
him. And Harley Baggott, being nearest, replying: "Why, yes, sure.
He's around here somewhere." And Stuart Finchley calling: "Eh-o,
Griffiths!" But no reply.</p>

<p>Yet Clyde, not near enough to hear any of this, even now
returning toward the camp, very slowly and cautiously. And Mason
concluding that possibly he was about somewhere and unaware of
anything, of course, deciding to wait a few minutes
anyhow&mdash;while advising Swenk to fall back into the woods and
if by any chance encountering Slack or any other to advise him that
one man be sent east along the bank and another west, while
he&mdash;Swenk&mdash;proceeded in a boat eastward as before to the
inn at the extreme end, in order that from there word might be
given to all as to the presence of the suspect in this region.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile Clyde by now only three-quarters of a mile
east, and still whispered to by something which said: Run, run, do
not linger! yet lingering, and thinking <i>Sondra</i>, this
wonderful life! Should he go so? And saying to himself that he
might be making a greater mistake by going than by staying. For
supposing those shots were nothing&mdash;hunters, mere game shots
meaning nothing in his case&mdash;and yet costing him all? And yet
turning at last and saying to himself that perhaps it might be best
not to return at present, anyhow at least not until very
late&mdash;after dark&mdash;to see if those strange shots had meant
anything.</p>

<p>But then again pausing silently and dubiously, the while vesper
sparrows and woodfinches sang. And peering. And peeking
nervously.</p>

<p>And then all at once, not more than fifty feet distant, out of
the long, tall aisles of the trees before him, a whiskered,
woodsman-like type of man approaching swiftly, yet silently&mdash;a
tall, bony, sharp-eyed man in a brown felt hat and a brownish-gray
baggy and faded suit that hung loosely over his spare body. And as
suddenly calling as he came&mdash;which caused Clyde's blood to run
cold with fear and rivet him to the spot.</p>

<p>"Hold on a moment, mister! Don't move. Your name don't happen to
be Clyde Griffiths, does it?" And Clyde, noting the sharp
inquisitorial look in the eye of this stranger, as well as the fact
that he had already drawn a revolver and was lifting it up, now
pausing, the definiteness and authority of the man chilling him to
the marrow. Was he really being captured? Had the officers of the
law truly come for him? God! No hope of flight now! Why had he not
gone on? Oh, why not? And at once he was weak and shaking, yet, not
wishing to incriminate himself about to reply, "No!" Yet because of
a more sensible thought, replying, "Why, yes, that's my name."</p>

<p>"You're with this camping party just west of here, aren't
you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I am."</p>

<p>"All right, Mr. Griffiths. Excuse the revolver. I'm told to get
you, whatever happens, that's all. My name is Kraut. Nicholas
Kraut. I'm a deputy sheriff of Cataraqui County. And I have a
warrant here for your arrest. I suppose you know what for, and that
you're prepared to come with me peaceably." And at this Mr. Kraut
gripped the heavy, dangerous-looking weapon more firmly even, and
gazed at Clyde in a firm, conclusive way.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;why&mdash;no&mdash;I don't," replied Clyde, weakly
and heavily, his face white and thin. "But if you have a warrant
for my arrest, I'll go with you, certainly. But
what&mdash;what&mdash;I don't understand"&mdash; his voice began to
tremble slightly as he said this&mdash;"is&mdash;is why you want to
arrest me?"</p>

<p>"You don't, eh? You weren't up at either Big Bittern or Grass
Lake by any chance on last Wednesday or Thursday, eh?"</p>

<p>"Why, no, sir, I wasn't," replied Clyde, falsely.</p>

<p>"And you don't happen to know anything about the drowning of a
girl up there that you were supposed to be with&mdash;Roberta
Alden, of Biltz, New York, I believe."</p>

<p>"Why, my God, no!" replied Clyde, nervously and staccatically,
the true name of Roberta and her address being used by this total
stranger, and so soon, staggering him. Then they knew! They had
obtained a clue. His true name and hers! God! "Am I supposed to
have committed a murder?" he added, his voice faint&mdash;a mere
whisper.</p>

<p>"Then you don't know that she was drowned last Thursday? And you
weren't with her at that time?" Mr. Kraut fixed a hard,
inquisitive, unbelieving eye on him.</p>

<p>"Why, no, of course, I wasn't," replied Clyde, recalling now but
one thing&mdash;that he must deny all&mdash;until he should think
or know what else to do or say.</p>

<p>"And you didn't meet three men walking south last Thursday night
from Big Bittern to Three Mile Bay at about eleven o'clock?"</p>

<p>"Why, no, sir. Of course I didn't. I wasn't up there, I told
you."</p>

<p>"Very well, Mr. Griffiths, I haven't anything more to say. All
I'm supposed to do is to arrest you, Clyde Griffiths, for the
murder of Roberta Alden. You're my prisoner." He drew
forth&mdash;more by way of a demonstration of force and authority
than anything else&mdash;a pair of steel handcuffs, which caused
Clyde to shrink and tremble as though he had been beaten.</p>

<p>"You needn't put those on me, mister," he pleaded. "I wish you
wouldn't. I never had anything like that on before. I'll go with
you without them." He looked longingly and sadly about at the
trees, into the sheltering depths of which so recently he ought to
have plunged. To safety.</p>

<p>"Very well, then," replied the redoubtable Kraut. "So long as
you come along peaceful." And he took Clyde by one of his almost
palsied arms.</p>

<p>"Do you mind if I ask you something else," asked Clyde, weakly
and fearsomely, as they now proceeded, the thought of Sondra and
the others shimmering blindingly and reducingly before his eyes.
Sondra! Sondra! To go back there an arrested murderer! And before
her and Bertine! Oh, no! "Are you, are you intending to take me to
that camp back there?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, that's where I'm intending to take you now. Them's my
orders. That's where the district attorney and the sheriff of
Cataraqui County are just now."</p>

<p>"Oh, I know, I know," pleaded Clyde, hysterically, for by now he
had lost almost all poise, "but couldn't you&mdash;couldn't
you&mdash;so long as I go along just as you want&mdash;those are
all my friends, you know, back there, and I'd hate...couldn't you
just take me around the camp somewhere to wherever you want to take
me? I have a very special reason&mdash;that is&mdash;I&mdash;I, oh,
God, I hope you won't take me back there right now&mdash;will you
please, Mr. Kraut?"</p>

<p>He seemed to Kraut very boyish and weak now&mdash;clean of
feature, rather innocent as to eye, well-dressed and
well-mannered&mdash;not at all the savage and brutal or murderous
type he had expected to find. Indeed quite up to the class whom he
(Kraut) was inclined to respect. And might he not after all be a
youth of very powerful connections? The conversations he had
listened to thus far had indicated that this youth was certainly
identified with one of the best families in Lycurgus. And in
consequence he was now moved to a slight show of courtesy and so
added: "Very well, young man, I don't want to be too hard on you.
After all, I'm not the sheriff or the district attorney&mdash;just
the arresting officer. There are others down there who are going to
be able to say what to do about you&mdash;and when we get down to
where they are, you can ask 'em, and it may be that they won't find
it necessary to take you back in there. But how about your clothes?
They're back there, ain't they?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, but that doesn't matter," replied Clyde, nervously and
eagerly. "I can get those any time. I just don't want to go back
now, if I can help it."</p>

<p>"All right, then, come along," replied Mr. Kraut.</p>

<p>And so it was that they walked on together now in silence, the
tall shafts of the trees in the approaching dusk making solemn
aisles through which they proceeded as might worshipers along the
nave of a cathedral, the eyes of Clyde contemplating nervously and
wearily a smear of livid red still visible through the trees to the
west.</p>

<p>Charged with murder! Roberta dead! And Sondra dead&mdash;to him!
And the Griffiths! And his uncle! And his mother! and all those
people in that camp!</p>

<p>Oh, oh, God, why was it that he had not run, when that
something, whatever it was, had so urged him?</p>

<h3>Chapter 9</h3>

<p>In the absence of Clyde, the impressions taken by Mr. Mason of
the world in which he moved here, complementing and confirming
those of Lycurgus and Sharon, were sufficient to sober him in
regard to the ease (possibly) with which previously he had imagined
it might be possible to convict him. For about him was such a scene
as suggested all the means as well as the impulse to quiet such a
scandal as this. Wealth. Luxury. Important names and connections to
protect no doubt. Was it not possible that the rich and powerful
Griffiths, their nephew seized in this way and whatever his crime,
would take steps to secure the best legal talent available, in
order to protect their name? Unquestionably&mdash;and then with
such adjournments as it was possible for such talent to secure,
might it not be possible that long before he could hope to convict
him, he himself would automatically be disposed of as a prosecutor
and without being nominated for and elected to the judgeship he so
craved and needed.</p>

<p>Sitting before the circle of attractive tents that faced the
lake and putting in order a fishing-pole and reel, was Harley
Baggott, in a brightly-colored sweater and flannel trousers. And
through the open flies of several tents, glimpses of
individuals&mdash;Sondra, Bertine, Wynette and others&mdash;busy
about toilets necessitated by the recent swim. Being dubious
because of the smartness of the company as to whether it was
politically or socially wise to proclaim openly the import of his
errand, he chose to remain silent for a time, reflecting on the
difference between the experiences of his early youth and that of
Roberta Alden and these others. Naturally as he saw it a man of
this Griffiths' connections would seek to use a girl of Roberta's
connections thus meanly and brutally and hope to get away with it.
Yet, eager to make as much progress as he could against whatever
inimical fates might now beset him, he finally approached Baggott,
and most acidly, yet with as much show of genial and appreciative
sociability as he could muster, observed:</p>

<p>"A delightful place for a camp, eh?"</p>

<p>"Yeh, we think so."</p>

<p>"Just a group from the estates and hotels about Sharon, I
suppose?"</p>

<p>"Yeh. The south and west shore principally."</p>

<p>"Not any of the Griffiths, other than Mr. Clyde, I presume?"</p>

<p>"No, they're still over at Greenwood, I think."</p>

<p>"You know Mr. Clyde Griffiths personally, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Oh, sure&mdash;he's one of the party."</p>

<p>"You don't happen to know how long he's been up here this time,
I presume&mdash;up with the Cranstons, I mean."</p>

<p>"Since Friday, I think. I saw him Friday morning, anyhow. But
he'll be back here soon and you can ask him yourself," concluded
Baggott, beginning to sense that Mr. Mason was a little too
inquisitive and in addition not of either his or Clyde's world.</p>

<p>And just then, Frank Harriet, with a tennis racquet under his
arm, striding across the foreground.</p>

<p>"Where to, Frankie?"</p>

<p>"To try those courts Harrison laid out up here this
morning."</p>

<p>"Who with?"</p>

<p>"Violet, Nadine and Stuart."</p>

<p>"Any room for another court?"</p>

<p>"Sure, there's two. Why not get Bert, and Clyde, and Sondra, and
come up?"</p>

<p>"Well, maybe, after I get this thing set."</p>

<p>And Mason at once thinking: Clyde and Sondra. Clyde Griffiths
and Sondra Finchley&mdash;the very girl whose notes and cards were
in one of his pockets now. And might he not see her here, along
with Clyde&mdash; possibly later talk to her about him?</p>

<p>But just then, Sondra and Bertine and Wynette coming out of
their respective tents. And Bertine calling: "Oh, say, Harley, seen
Nadine anywhere?"</p>

<p>"No, but Frank just went by. He said he was going up to the
courts to play with her and Violet and Stew."</p>

<p>"Yes? Well, then, come on, Sondra. You too, Wynette. We'll see
how it looks."</p>

<p>Bertine, as she pronounced Sondra's name, turned to take her
arm, which gave Mason the exact information and opportunity he
desired&mdash; that of seeing and studying for a moment the girl
who had so tragically and no doubt all unwittingly replaced Roberta
in Clyde's affections. And, as he could see for himself, more
beautiful, more richly appareled than ever the other could have
hoped to be. And alive, as opposed to the other now dead and in a
morgue in Bridgeburg.</p>

<p>But even as he gazed, the three tripping off together arm in
arm, Sondra calling back to Harley: "If you see Clyde, tell him to
come on up, will you?" And he replying: "Do you think that shadow
of yours needs to be told?"</p>

<p>Mason, impressed by the color and the drama, looked intently and
even excitedly about. Now it was all so plain why he wanted to get
rid of the girl&mdash;the true, underlying motive. That beautiful
girl there, as well as this luxury to which he aspired. And to
think that a young man of his years and opportunities would stoop
to such a horrible trick as that! Unbelievable! And only four days
after the murder of the other poor girl, playing about with this
beautiful girl in this fashion, and hoping to marry her, as Roberta
had hoped to marry him. The unbelievable villainies of life!</p>

<p>Now, half-determining since Clyde did not appear, that he would
proclaim himself and proceed to search for and seize his belongings
here, Ed Swenk re-appearing and with a motion of the head
indicating that Mason was to follow him. And once well within the
shadow of the surrounding trees, indicating no less an individual
than Nicholas Kraut, attended by a slim, neatly-dressed youth of
about Clyde's reported years, who, on the instant and because of
the waxy paleness of his face, he assumed must be Clyde. And at
once he now approached him, as might an angry wasp or hornet, only
pausing first to ask of Swenk where he had been captured and by
whom&mdash;then gazing at Clyde critically and austerely as
befitted one who represented the power and majesty of the law.</p>

<p>"So you are Clyde Griffiths, are you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Griffiths, my name is Orville Mason. I am the
district attorney of the county in which Big Bittern and Grass Lake
are situated. I suppose you are familiar enough with those two
places by now, aren't you?"</p>

<p>He paused to see the effect of this sardonic bit of commentary.
Yet although he expected to see him wince and quail, Clyde merely
gazed at him, his nervous, dark eyes showing enormous strain. "No,
sir, I can't say that I am."</p>

<p>For with each step through the woods thus far back, there had
been growing within him the utter and unshakable conviction that in
the face of whatever seeming proof or charges might now appear, he
dared not tell anything in regard to himself, his connection with
Roberta, his visit to Big Bittern or Grass Lake. He dared not. For
that would be the same as a confession of guilt in connection with
something of which he was not really guilty. And no one must
believe&mdash;never&mdash;Sondra, or the Griffiths, or any of these
fine friends of his, that he could ever have been guilty of such a
thought, even. And yet here they were, all within call, and at any
moment might approach and so learn the meaning of his arrest. And
while he felt the necessity for so denying any knowledge in
connection with all this, at the same time he stood in absolute
terror of this man&mdash;the opposition and irritated mood such an
attitude might arouse in him. That broken nose. His large, stern
eyes.</p>

<p>And then Mason, eyeing him as one might an unheard-of and yet
desperate animal and irritated also by his denial, yet assuming
from his blanched expression that he might and no doubt would
shortly be compelled to confess his guilt, continuing with: "You
know what you are charged with, Mr. Griffiths, of course."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I just heard it from this man here."</p>

<p>"And you admit it?"</p>

<p>"Why, no sir, of course I don't admit it," replied Clyde, his
thin and now white lips drawn tight over his even teeth, his eyes
full of a deep, tremulous yet evasive terror.</p>

<p>"Why, what nonsense! What effrontery! You deny being up to Grass
Lake and Big Bittern on last Wednesday and Thursday?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, then," and now Mason stiffened himself in an angry and at
the same time inquisitorial way, "I suppose you are going to deny
knowing Roberta Alden&mdash;the girl you took to Grass Lake, and
then out on Big Bittern in that boat last Thursday&mdash;the girl
you knew in Lycurgus all last year, who lived at Mrs. Gilpin's and
worked under you in your department at Griffiths &amp;
Company&mdash;the girl to whom you gave that toilet set last
Christmas! I suppose you're going to say that your name isn't Clyde
Griffiths and that you haven't been living with Mrs. Peyton in
Taylor Street, and that these aren't letters and cards from your
trunk there&mdash;from Roberta Alden and from Miss Finchley, all
these cards and notes." And extracting the letters and cards as he
spoke and waving them before Clyde. And at each point in this
harangue, thrusting his broad face, with its flat, broken nose and
somewhat aggressive chin directly before Clyde's, and blazing at
him with sultry, contemptuous eyes, while the latter leaned away
from him, wincing almost perceptibly and with icy chills running up
and down his spine and affecting his heart and brain. Those
letters! All this information concerning him! And back in his bag
in the tent there, all those more recent letters of Sondra's in
which she dwelt on how they were to elope together this coming
fall. If only he had destroyed them! And now this man might find
those&mdash;would&mdash;and question Sondra maybe, and all these
others. He shrunk and congealed spiritually, the revealing effects
of his so poorly conceived and executed scheme weighing upon him as
the world upon the shoulders of an inadequate Atlas.</p>

<p>And yet, feeling that he must say something and yet not admit
anything. And finally replying: "My name's Clyde Griffiths all
right, but the rest of this isn't true. I don't know anything about
the rest of it."</p>

<p>"Oh, come now, Mr. Griffiths! Don't begin by trying to play fast
and loose with me. We won't get anywhere that way. You won't help
yourself one bit by that with me, and besides I haven't any time
for that now. Remember these men here are witnesses to what you
say. I've just come from Lycurgus&mdash;your room at Mrs.
Peyton's&mdash;and I have in my possession your trunk and this Miss
Alden's letters to you&mdash;indisputable proof that you did know
this girl, that you courted and seduced her last winter, and that
since then&mdash;this spring&mdash;when she became pregnant on your
account, you induced her first to go home and then later to go away
with you on this trip in order, as you told her, to marry her.
Well, you married her all right&mdash;to the grave&mdash;that's how
you married her&mdash;to the water at the bottom of Big Bittern
Lake! And you can actually stand here before me now, when I tell
you that I have all the evidence I need right on my person, and say
that you don't even know her! Well, I'll be damned!"</p>

<p>And as he spoke his voice grew so loud that Clyde feared that it
could be clearly heard in the camp beyond. And that Sondra herself
might hear it and come over. And although at the outrush and jab
and slash of such dooming facts as Mason so rapidly outlined, his
throat tightened and his hands were with difficulty restrained from
closing and clinching vise-wise, at the conclusion of it all he
merely replied: "Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll be damned!" reiterated Mason. "I can well believe
now that you would kill a girl and sneak away in just such a way as
you did&mdash;and with her in that condition! But then to try to
deny her own letters to you! Why, you might as well try to deny
that you're here and alive. These cards and notes here&mdash;what
about them? I suppose they're not from Miss Finchley? How about
those? Do you mean to tell me these are not from her either?"</p>

<p>He waved them before Clyde's eyes. And Clyde, seeing that the
truth concerning these, Sondra being within call, was capable of
being substantiated here and now, replied: "No, I don't deny that
those are from her."</p>

<p>"Very good. But these others from your trunk in the same room
are not from Miss Alden to you?"</p>

<p>"I don't care to say as to that," he replied, blinking feebly as
Mason waved Roberta's letters before him.</p>

<p>"Tst! Tst! Tst! Of all things," clicked Mason in high dudgeon.
"Such nonsense! Such effrontery! Oh, very well, we won't worry
about all that now. I can easily prove it all when the time comes.
But how you can stand there and deny it, knowing that I have the
evidence, is beyond me! A card in your own handwriting which you
forgot to take out of the bag you had her leave at Gun Lodge while
you took yours with you. Mr. Carl Graham, Mr. Clifford Golden, Mr.
Clyde Griffiths,&mdash;a card on which you wrote 'From Clyde to
Bert, Merry Xmas.' Do you remember that? Well, here it is." And
here he reached into his pocket and drew forth the small card taken
from the toilet set and waved it under Clyde's nose. "Have you
forgotten that, too? Your own handwriting!" And then pausing and
getting no reply, finally adding: "Why, what a dunce you
are!&mdash; what a poor plotter, without even the brains not to use
your own initials in getting up those fake names you had hoped to
masquerade under&mdash;Mr. Carl Graham&mdash;Mr. Clifford
Golden!"</p>

<p>At the same time, fully realizing the importance of a confession
and wondering how it was to be brought about here and now, Mason
suddenly&mdash;Clyde's expression, his frozen-faced terror,
suggesting the thought that perhaps he was too frightened to talk
at once changed his tactics&mdash;at least to the extent of
lowering his voice, smoothing the formidable wrinkles from his
forehead and about his mouth.</p>

<p>"You see, it's this way, Griffiths," he now began, much more
calmly and simply. "Lying or just foolish thoughtless denial under
such circumstances as these can't help you in the least. It can
only harm you, and that's the truth. You may think I've been a
little rough so far, but it was only because I've been under a
great strain myself in connection with this case, trying to catch
up with some one I thought would be a very different type from
yourself. But now that I see you and see how you feel about it
all&mdash;how really frightened you are by what has
happened&mdash;it just occurs to me that there may be something in
connection with this case, some extenuating circumstances, which,
if they were related by you now, might throw a slightly different
light on all this. Of course, I don't know. You yourself ought to
be the best judge, but I'm laying the thought before you for what
it's worth. For, of course, here are these letters. Besides, when
we get to Three Mile Bay to-morrow, as we will, I hope, there will
be those three men who met you the other night walking south from
Big Bittern. And not only those, but the innkeeper from Grass Lake,
the innkeeper from Big Bittern, the boatkeeper up there who rented
that boat, and the driver who drove you and Roberta Alden over from
Gun Lodge. They will identify you. Do you think they won't know
you&mdash;not any of them&mdash;not be able to say whether you were
up there with her or not, or that a jury when the time comes won't
believe them?"</p>

<p>And all this Clyde registered mentally like a machine clicking
to a coin, yet said nothing,&mdash;merely staring, frozen.</p>

<p>"And not only that," went on Mason, very softly and most
ingratiatingly, "but there's Mrs. Peyton. She saw me take these
letters and cards out of that trunk of yours in your room and from
the top drawer of your chiffonier. Next, there are all those girls
in that factory where you and Miss Alden worked. Do you suppose
they're not going to remember all about you and her when they learn
that she is dead? Oh, what nonsense! You ought to be able to see
that for yourself, whatever you think. You certainly can't expect
to get away with that. It makes a sort of a fool out of you. You
can see that for yourself."</p>

<p>He paused again, hoping for a confession. But Clyde still
convinced that any admission in connection with Roberta or Big
Bittern spelled ruin, merely stared while Mason proceeded to
add:</p>

<p>"All right, Griffiths, I'm now going to tell you one more thing,
and I couldn't give you better advice if you were my own son or
brother and I were trying to get you out of this instead of merely
trying to get you to tell the truth. If you hope to do anything at
all for yourself now, it's not going to help you to deny everything
in the way you are doing. You are simply making trouble and
condemning yourself in other people's eyes. Why not say that you
did know her and that you were up there with her and that she wrote
you those letters, and be done with it? You can't get out of that,
whatever else you may hope to get out of. Any sane
person&mdash;your own mother, if she were here&mdash;would tell you
the same thing. It's too ridiculous and indicates guilt rather than
innocence. Why not come clean here and now as to those facts,
anyhow, before it's too late to take advantage of any mitigating
circumstances in connection with all this&mdash;if there are any?
And if you do <i>now</i>, and I can help you in any way, I promise
you here and now that I'll be only too glad to do so. For, after
all, I'm not out here just to hound a man to death or make him
confess to something that he hasn't done, but merely to get at the
truth in the case. But if you're going to deny that you even knew
this girl when I tell you I have all the evidence and can prove it,
why then&mdash;" and here the district attorney lifted his hands
aloft most wearily and disgustedly.</p>

<p>But now as before Clyde remained silent and pale. In spite of
all Mason had revealed, and all that this seemingly friendly,
intimate advice seemed to imply, still he could not conceive that
it would be anything less than disastrous for him to admit that he
even knew Roberta. The fatality of such a confession in the eyes of
these others here. The conclusion of all his dreams in connection
with Sondra and this life. And so, in the face of
this&mdash;silence, still. And at this, Mason, irritated beyond
measure, finally exclaiming: "Oh, very well, then. So you've
finally decided not to talk, have you?" And Clyde, blue and weak,
replied: "I had nothing to do with her death. That's all I can say
now," and yet even as he said it thinking that perhaps he had
better not say that&mdash;that perhaps he had better
say&mdash;well, what? That he knew Roberta, of course, had been up
there with her, for that matter&mdash;but that he had never
intended to kill her&mdash;that her drowning was an accident. For
he had not struck her at all, except by accident, had he? Only it
was best not to confess to having struck her at all, wasn't it? For
who under such circumstances would believe that he had struck her
with a camera by accident. Best not to mention the camera, since
there was no mention anywhere in the papers that he had had one
with him.</p>

<p>And he was still cogitating while Mason was exclaiming: "Then
you admit that you knew her?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"Very well, then," he now added, turning to the others, "I
suppose there's nothing for it but to take him back there and see
what they know about him. Perhaps that will get something out of
this fine bird&mdash;to confront him with his friends. His bag and
things are still back there in one of those tents, I believe.
Suppose we take him down there, gentlemen, and see what these other
people know about him."</p>

<p>And now, swiftly and coldly he turned, while Clyde, already
shrinking at the horror of what was coming, exclaimed: "Oh, please,
no! You don't mean to do that, do you? Oh, you won't do that! Oh,
please, no!"</p>

<p>And at this point Kraut speaking up and saying: "He asked me
back there in the woods if I wouldn't ask you not to take him in
there." "Oh, so that's the way the wind blows, is it?" exclaimed
Mason at this. "Too thin-skinned to be shown up before ladies and
gentlemen of the Twelfth Lake colony, but not even willing to admit
that you knew the poor little working-girl who worked for you. Very
good. Well, then, my fine friend, suppose you come through with
what you really do know now, or down there you go." And he paused a
moment to see what effect that would have. "We'll call all those
people together and explain just how things are, and then see if
you will be willing to stand there and deny everything!" But noting
still a touch of hesitation in Clyde he now added: "Bring him
along, boys." And turning toward the camp he proceeded to walk in
that direction a few paces while Kraut taking one arm, and Swenk
another, and beginning to move Clyde he ended by exclaiming:</p>

<p>"Oh, please, no! Oh, I hope you won't do anything like that,
will you, Mr. Mason? Oh, I don't want to go back there if you don't
mind. It isn't that I'm guilty, but you can get all my things
without my going back there. And besides it will mean so much to me
just now." Beads of perspiration once more burst forth on his pale
face and hands and he was deadly cold.</p>

<p>"Don't want to go, eh?" exclaimed Mason, pausing as he heard
this. "It would hurt your pride, would it, to have 'em know? Well,
then, supposing you just answer some of the things I want to
know&mdash;and come clean and quick, or off we go&mdash;and that
without one more moment's delay! Now, will you answer or won't
you?" And again he turned to confront Clyde, who, with lips
trembling and eyes confused and wavering, nervously and
emphatically announced:</p>

<p>"Of course I knew her. Of course I did. Sure! Those letters show
that. But what of it? I didn't kill her. And I didn't go up there
with her with any intention of killing her, either. I didn't. I
didn't, I tell you! It was all an accident. I didn't even want to
take her up there. She wanted me to go&mdash;to go away with her
somewhere, because&mdash;because, well you know&mdash;her letters
show. And I was only trying to get her to go off somewhere by
herself, so she would let me alone, because I didn't want to marry
her. That's all. And I took her out there, not to kill her at all,
but to try to persuade her, that's all. And I didn't upset the
boat&mdash;at least, I didn't mean to. The wind blew my hat off,
and we&mdash;she and I&mdash;got up at the same time to reach for
it and the boat upset&mdash;that's all. And the side of it hit her
on the head. I saw it, only I was too frightened the way she was
struggling about in the water to go near her, because I was afraid
that if I did she might drag me down. And then she went down. And I
swam ashore. And that's the God's truth!"</p>

<p>His face, as he talked, had suddenly become all flushed, and his
hands also. Yet his eyes were tortured, terrified pools of misery.
He was thinking&mdash;but maybe there wasn't any wind that
afternoon and maybe they would find that out. Or the tripod hidden
under a log. If they found that, wouldn't they think he hit her
with that? He was wet and trembling.</p>

<p>But already Mason was beginning to question him again.</p>

<p>"Now, let's see as to this a minute. You say you didn't take her
up there with any intention of killing her?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, I didn't."</p>

<p>"Well, then, how was it that you decided to write your name two
different ways on those registers up there at Big Bittern and Grass
Lake?"</p>

<p>"Because I didn't want any one to know that I was up there with
her."</p>

<p>"Oh, I see. Didn't want any scandal in connection with the
condition she was in?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. Yes, sir, that is."</p>

<p>"But you didn't mind if her name was scandalized in case she was
found afterwards?"</p>

<p>"But I didn't know she was going to be drowned," replied Clyde,
slyly and shrewdly, sensing the trap in time.</p>

<p>"But you did know that you yourself weren't coming back, of
course. You knew that, didn't you?"</p>

<p>"Why, no, sir, I didn't know that I wasn't coming back. I
thought I was."</p>

<p>"Pretty clever. Pretty clever," thought Mason to himself, but
not saying so, and then, rapidly: "And so in order to make
everything easy and natural as possible for you to come back, you
took your own bag with you and left hers up there. Is that the way?
How about that?"</p>

<p>"But I didn't take it because I was going away. We decided to
put our lunch in it."</p>

<p>"We, or you?"</p>

<p>"We."</p>

<p>"And so you had to carry that big bag in order to take a little
lunch along, eh? Couldn't you have taken it in a paper, or in her
bag?"</p>

<p>"Well, her bag was full, and I didn't like to carry anything in
a paper."</p>

<p>"Oh, I see. Too proud and sensitive, eh? But not too proud to
carry a heavy bag all the way, say twelve miles, in the night to
Three Mile Bay, and not ashamed to be seen doing it, either, were
you?"</p>

<p>"Well, after she was drowned and I didn't want to be known as
having been up there with her, and had to go along&mdash;"</p>

<p>He paused while Mason merely looked at him, thinking of the
many, many questions he wanted to ask him&mdash;so many, many more,
and which, as he knew or guessed, would be impossible for him to
explain. Yet it was getting late, and back in the camp were Clyde's
as yet unclaimed belongings&mdash;his bag and possibly that suit he
had worn that day at Big Bittern&mdash;a gray one as he had
heard&mdash;not this one. And to catechize him here this way in the
dusk, while it might be productive of much if only he could
continue it long enough, still there was the trip back, and en
route he would have ample time to continue his questionings.</p>

<p>And so, although he disliked much so to do at the moment, he now
concluded with: "Oh, well, I tell you, Griffiths, we'll let you
rest here for the present. It may be that what you are saying is
so&mdash;I don't know. I most certainly hope it is, for your sake.
At any rate, you go along there with Mr. Kraut. He'll show you
where to go."</p>

<p>And then turning to Swenk and Kraut, he exclaimed: "All right,
boys. I'll tell you how we'll do. It's getting late and we'll have
to hurry a little if we expect to get anywhere yet tonight. Mr.
Kraut, suppose you take this young man down where those other two
boats are and wait there. Just halloo a little as you go along to
notify the sheriff and Sissel that we're ready. And then Swenk and
I'll be along in the other boat as soon as we can."</p>

<p>And so saying and Kraut obeying, he and Swenk proceeded inward
through the gathering dusk to the camp, while Kraut with Clyde went
west, hallooing for the sheriff and his deputy until a response was
had.</p>

<h3>Chapter 10</h3>

<p>The effect of Mason's re-appearance in the camp with the news,
announced first to Frank Harriet, next to Harley Baggott and Grant
Cranston, that Clyde was under arrest&mdash;that he actually had
confessed to having been with Roberta at Big Bittern, if not to
having killed her, and that he, Mason, was there with Swenk to take
possession of his property&mdash;was sufficient to destroy this
pretty outing as by a breath. For although amazement and disbelief
and astounded confusion were characteristic of the words of all,
nevertheless here was Mason demanding to know where were Clyde's
things, and asserting that it was at Clyde's request only that he
was not brought here to identify his own possessions.</p>

<p>Frank Harriet, the most practical of the group, sensing the
truth and authority of this, at once led the way to Clyde's tent,
where Mason began an examination of the contents of the bag and
clothes, while Grant Cranston, as well as Baggott, aware of
Sondra's intense interest in Clyde, departed first to call Stuart,
then Bertine, and finally Sondra&mdash;moving apart from the rest
the more secretly to inform her as to what was then occurring. And
she, following the first clear understanding as to this, turning
white and fainting at the news, falling back in Grant's arms and
being carried to her tent, where, after being restored to
consciousness, she exclaimed: "I don't believe a word of it! It's
not true! Why, it couldn't be! That poor boy! Oh, Clyde! Where is
he? Where have they taken him?" But Stuart and Grant, by no means
as emotionally moved as herself, cautioning her to be silent. It
might be true at that. Supposing it were! The others would hear,
wouldn't they? And supposing it weren't&mdash;he could soon prove
his innocence and be released, couldn't he? There was no use in
carrying on like this now.</p>

<p>But then, Sondra in her thoughts going over the bare possibility
of such a thing&mdash;a girl killed by Clyde at Big
Bittern&mdash;himself arrested and being taken off in this
way&mdash;and she thus publicly&mdash;or at least by this
group&mdash;known to be so interested in him,&mdash;her parents to
know, the public itself to know&mdash;maybe&mdash;</p>

<p>But Clyde must be innocent. It must be all a mistake. And then
her mind turning back and thinking of that news of the drowned girl
she had first heard over the telephone there at the Harriets'. And
then Clyde's whiteness&mdash;his illness&mdash;his all but complete
collapse. Oh, no!&mdash;not that! Yet his delay in coming from
Lycurgus until the Friday before. His failure to write from there.
And then, the full horror of the charge returning, as suddenly
collapsing again, lying perfectly still and white while Grant and
the others agreed among themselves that the best thing to be done
was to break up the camp, either now or early in the morning, and
depart for Sharon.</p>

<p>And Sondra returning to consciousness after a time tearfully
announcing that she must get out of here at once, that she couldn't
"endure this place," and begging Bertine and all the others to stay
close to her and say nothing about her having fainted and cried,
since it would only create talk. And thinking all the time of how,
if this were all true, she could secure those letters she had
written him! Oh, heavens! For supposing now at this time they
should fall into the hands of the police or the newspapers, and be
published? And yet moved by her love for him and for the first time
in her young life shaken to the point where the grim and stern
realities of life were thrust upon her gay and vain notice.</p>

<p>And so it was immediately arranged that she leave with Stuart,
Bertine and Grant for the Metissic Inn at the eastern end of the
Lake, since from there, at dawn, according to Baggott, they might
leave for Albany&mdash;and so, in a roundabout way for Sharon.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Mason, after obtaining possession of all
Clyde's belongings here, quickly making his way west to Little Fish
Inlet and Three Mile Bay, stopping only for the first night at a
farmhouse and arriving at Three Mile Bay late on Tuesday night. Yet
not without, en route, catechizing Clyde as he had planned, the
more particularly since in going through his effects in the tent at
the camp he had not found the gray suit said to have been worn by
Clyde at Big Bittern.</p>

<p>And Clyde, troubled by this new development, denying that he had
worn a gray suit and insisting that the suit he had on was the one
he had worn.</p>

<p>"But wasn't it thoroughly soaked?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well, then, where was it cleaned and pressed afterward?"</p>

<p>"In Sharon."</p>

<p>"In Sharon?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"By a tailor there?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"What tailor?"</p>

<p>Alas, Clyde could not remember.</p>

<p>"Then you wore it crumpled and wet, did you, from Big Bittern to
Sharon?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"And no one noticed it, of course."</p>

<p>"Not that I remember&mdash;no."</p>

<p>"Not that you remember, eh? Well, we'll see about that later,"
and deciding that unquestionably Clyde was a plotter and a
murderer. Also that eventually he could make Clyde show where he
had hidden the suit or had had it cleaned.</p>

<p>Next there was the straw hat found on the lake. What about that?
By admitting that the wind had blown his hat off, Clyde had
intimated that he had worn a hat on the lake, but not necessarily
the straw hat found on the water. But now Mason was intent on
establishing within hearing of these witnesses, the ownership of
the hat found on the water as well as the existence of a second hat
worn later.</p>

<p>"That straw hat of yours that you say the wind blew in the
water? You didn't try to get that either at the time, did you?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"Didn't think of it, I suppose, in the excitement?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"But just the same, you had another straw hat when you went down
through the woods there. Where did you get that one?"</p>

<p>And Clyde, trapped and puzzled by this pausing for the fraction
of a second, frightened and wondering whether or not it could be
proved that this second straw hat he was wearing was the one he had
worn through the woods. Also whether the one on the water had been
purchased in Utica, as it had. And then deciding to lie. "But I
didn't have another straw hat." Without paying any attention to
that, Mason reached over and took the straw hat on Clyde's head and
proceeded to examine the lining with its imprint&mdash;Stark &amp;
Company, Lycurgus.</p>

<p>"This one has a lining, I see. Bought this in Lycurgus, eh?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"When?"</p>

<p>"Oh, back in June."</p>

<p>"But still you're sure now it's not the one you wore down
through the woods that night?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, where was it then?"</p>

<p>And Clyde once more pausing like one in a trap and thinking: My
God! How am I to explain this now? Why did I admit that the one on
the lake was mine? Yet, as instantly recalling that whether he had
denied it or not, there were those at Grass Lake and Big Bittern
who would remember that he had worn a straw hat on the lake, of
course.</p>

<p>"Where was it then?" insisted Mason.</p>

<p>And Clyde at last saying: "Oh, I was up here once before and
wore it then. I forgot it when I went down the last time but I
found it again the other day."</p>

<p>"Oh, I see. Very convenient, I must say." He was beginning to
believe that he had a very slippery person to deal with
indeed&mdash; that he must think of his traps more shrewdly, and at
the same time determining to summon the Cranstons and every member
of the Bear Lake party in order to discover, whether any recalled
Clyde not wearing a straw hat on his arrival this time, also
whether he had left a straw hat the time before. He was lying, of
course, and he would catch him.</p>

<p>And so no real peace for Clyde at any time between there and
Bridgeburg and the county jail. For however much he might refuse to
answer, still Mason was forever jumping at him with such questions
as: Why was it if all you wanted to do was to eat lunch on shore
that you had to row all the way down to that extreme south end of
the lake when it isn't nearly so attractive there as it is at other
points? And: Where was it that you spent the rest of that
afternoon&mdash;surely not just there? And then, jumping back to
Sondra's letters discovered in his bag. How long had he known her?
Was he as much in love with her as she appeared to be with him?
Wasn't it because of her promise to marry him in the fall that he
had decided to kill Miss Alden?</p>

<p>But while Clyde vehemently troubled to deny this last charge,
still for the most part he gazed silently and miserably before him
with his tortured and miserable eyes.</p>

<p>And then a most wretched night spent in the garret of a
farmhouse at the west end of the lake, and on a pallet on the
floor, while Sissel, Swenk and Kraut, gun in hand, in turn kept
watch over him, and Mason and the sheriff and the others slept
below stairs. And some natives, because of information distributed
somehow, coming toward morning to inquire: "We hear the feller that
killed the girl over to Big Bittern is here&mdash;is that right?"
And then waiting to see them off at dawn in the Fords secured by
Mason.</p>

<p>And again at Little Fish Inlet as well as Three Mile Bay, actual
crowds&mdash;farmers, store-keepers, summer residents, woodsmen,
children&mdash;all gathered because of word telephoned on ahead
apparently. And at the latter place, Burleigh, Heit and Newcomb,
who, because of previously telephoned information, had brought
before one Gabriel Gregg, a most lanky and crusty and meticulous
justice of the peace, all of the individuals from Big Bittern
necessary to identify him fully. And now Mason, before this local
justice, charging Clyde with the death of Roberta and having him
properly and legally held as a material witness to be lodged in the
county jail at Bridgeburg. And then taking him, along with Burton,
the sheriff and his deputies, to Bridgeburg, where he was promptly
locked up.</p>

<p>And once there, Clyde throwing himself on the iron cot and
holding his head in a kind of agony of despair. It was three
o'clock in the morning, and just outside the jail as they
approached he had seen a crowd of at least five
hundred&mdash;noisy, jeering, threatening. For had not the news
been forwarded that because of his desire to marry a rich girl he
had most brutally assaulted and murdered a young and charming
working-girl whose only fault had been that she loved him too well.
There had been hard and threatening cries of "There he is, the
dirty bastard! You'll swing for this yet, you young devil, wait and
see!" This from a young woodsman not unlike Swenk in type&mdash;a
hard, destroying look in his fierce young eyes, leaning out from
the crowd. And worse, a waspish type of small-town slum girl,
dressed in a gingham dress, who in the dim light of the arcs, had
leaned forward to cry: "Lookit, the dirty little sneak&mdash;the
murderer! You thought you'd get away with it, didnja?"</p>

<p>And Clyde, crowding closer to Sheriff Slack, and thinking: Why,
they actually think I did kill her! And they may even lynch me! But
so weary and confused and debased and miserable that at the sight
of the outer steel jail door swinging open to receive him, he
actually gave vent to a sigh of relief because of the protection it
afforded.</p>

<p>But once in his cell, suffering none the less without cessation
the long night through, from thoughts&mdash;thoughts concerning all
that had just gone. Sondra! the Griffiths! Bertine. All those
people in Lycurgus when they should hear in the morning. His mother
eventually, everybody. Where was Sondra now? For Mason had told
her, of course, and all those others, when he had gone back to
secure his things. And they knew him now for what he was&mdash;a
plotter of murder! Only, only, if somebody could only know how it
had all come about! If Sondra, his mother, any one, could truly
see!</p>

<p>Perhaps if he were to explain all to this man Mason now, before
it all went any further, exactly how it all had happened. But that
meant a true explanation as to his plot, his real original intent,
that camera, his swimming away. That unintended blow&mdash;(and who
was going to believe him as to that)&mdash;his hiding the tripod
afterwards. Besides once all that was known would he not be done
for just the same in connection with Sondra, the
Griffiths&mdash;everybody. And very likely prosecuted and executed
for murder just the same. Oh, heavens&mdash;murder. And to be tried
for that now; this terrible crime against her proved. They would
electrocute him just the same&mdash; wouldn't they? And then the
full horror of that coming upon him,&mdash; death,
possibly&mdash;and for murder&mdash;he sat there quite still.
Death! God! If only he had not left those letters written him by
Roberta and his mother in his room there at Mrs. Peyton's. If only
he had removed his trunk to another room, say, before he left. Why
hadn't he thought of that? Yet as instantly thinking, might not
that have been a mistake, too, being seemingly a suspicious thing
to have done then? But how came they to know where he was from and
what his name was? Then, as instantly returning in mind to the
letters in the trunk. For, as he now recalled, in one of those
letters from his mother she had mentioned that affair in Kansas
City, and Mason would come to know of that. If only he had
destroyed them. Roberta's, his mother's, all! Why hadn't he? But
not being able to answer why&mdash;just an insane desire to keep
things maybe&mdash;anything that related to him&mdash;a kindness, a
tenderness toward him. If only he had not worn that second straw
hat&mdash;had not met those three men in the woods! God! He might
have known they would be able to trace him in some way. If only he
had gone on in that wood at Bear Lake, taking his suit case and
Sondra's letters with him. Perhaps, perhaps, who knows, in Boston,
or New York, or somewhere he might have hidden away.</p>

<p>Unstrung and agonized, he was unable to sleep at all, but walked
back and forth, or sat on the side of the hard and strange cot,
thinking, thinking. And at dawn, a bony, aged, rheumy jailer, in a
baggy, worn, blue uniform, bearing a black, iron tray, on which was
a tinful of coffee, some bread and a piece of ham with one egg. And
looking curiously and yet somehow indifferently at Clyde, while he
forced it through an aperture only wide and high enough for its
admission, though Clyde wanted nothing at all.</p>

<p>And then later Kraut and Sissel and Swenk, and eventually the
sheriff himself, each coming separately, to look in and say: "Well,
Griffiths, how are you this morning?" or, "Hello, anything we can
do for you?", while their eyes showed the astonishment, disgust,
suspicion or horror with which his assumed crime had filled them.
Yet, even in the face of that, having one type of interest and even
sycophantic pride in his presence here. For was he not a
Griffiths&mdash;a member of the well-known social group of the big
central cities to the south of here. Also the same to them, as well
as to the enormously fascinated public outside, as a trapped and
captured animal, taken in their legal net by their own superlative
skill and now held as witness to it? And with the newspapers and
people certain to talk, enormous publicity for them&mdash; their
pictures in the papers as well as his, their names persistently
linked with his.</p>

<p>And Clyde, looking at them between the bars, attempted to be
civil, since he was now in their hands and they could do with him
as they would.</p>

<h3>Chapter 11</h3>

<p>In connection with the autopsy and its results there was a
decided set-back. For while the joint report of the five doctors
showed: "An injury to the mouth and nose; the tip of the nose
appears to have been slightly flattened, the lips swollen, one
front tooth slightly loosened, and an abrasion of the mucous
membrane within the lips"&mdash;all agreed that these injuries were
by no means fatal. The chief injury was to the skull (the very
thing which Clyde in his first confession had maintained), which
appeared to have been severely bruised by a blow of "some sharp
instrument," unfortunately in this instance, because of the
heaviness of the blow of the boat, "signs of fracture and internal
haemorrhage which might have produced death."</p>

<p>But&mdash;the lungs when placed in water, sinking&mdash;an
absolute proof that Roberta could not have been dead when thrown
into the water, but alive and drowning, as Clyde had maintained.
And no other signs of violence or struggle, although her arms and
fingers appeared to be set in such a way as to indicate that she
might have been reaching or seeking to grasp something. The wale of
the boat? Could that be? Might Clyde's story, after all, conceal a
trace of truth? Certainly these circumstances seemed to favor him a
little. Yet as Mason and the others agreed, all these circumstances
most distinctly seemed to prove that although he might not have
slain her outright before throwing her into the water, none the
less he had struck her and then had thrown her, perhaps
unconscious, into the water.</p>

<p>But with what? If he could but make Clyde say that!</p>

<p>And then an inspiration! He would take Clyde and, although the
law specifically guaranteed accused persons against compulsions,
compel him to retrace the scenes of his crime. And although he
might not be able to make him commit himself in any way, still,
once on the ground and facing the exact scene of his crime, his
actions might reveal something of the whereabouts of the suit,
perhaps, or possibly some instrument with which he had struck
her.</p>

<p>And in consequence, on the third day following Clyde's
incarceration, a second visit to Big Bittern, with Kraut, Heit,
Mason, Burton, Burleigh, Earl Newcomb and Sheriff Slack as his
companions, and a slow re-canvassing of all the ground he had first
traveled on that dreadful day. And with Kraut, following
instructions from Mason, "playing up" to him, in order to
ingratiate himself into his good graces, and possibly cause him to
make a clean breast of it. For Kraut was to argue that the
evidence, so far was so convincing that you "never would get a jury
to believe that you didn't do it," but that, "if you would talk
right out to Mason, he could do more for you with the judge and the
governor than any one could&mdash;get you off, maybe, with life or
twenty years, while this way you're likely to get the chair,
sure."</p>

<p>Yet Clyde, because of that same fear that had guided him at Bear
Lake, maintaining a profound silence. For why should he say that he
had struck her, when he had not&mdash;intentionally at least? Or
with what, since no thought of the camera had come up as yet.</p>

<p>At the lake, after definite measurements by the county surveyor
as to the distance from the spot where Roberta had drowned to the
spot where Clyde had landed, Earl Newcomb suddenly returning to
Mason with an important discovery. For under a log not so far from
the spot at which Clyde had stood to remove his wet clothes, the
tripod he had hidden, a little rusty and damp, but of sufficient
weight, as Mason and all these others were now ready to believe, to
have delivered the blow upon Roberta's skull which had felled her
and so make it possible for him to carry her to the boat and later
drown her. Yet, confronted with this and turning paler than before,
Clyde denying that he had a camera or a tripod with him, although
Mason was instantly deciding that he would re-question all
witnesses to find out whether any recalled seeing a tripod or
camera in Clyde's possession.</p>

<p>And before the close of this same day learning from the guide
who had driven Clyde and Roberta over, as well as the boatman who
had seen Clyde drop his bag into the boat, and a young waitress at
Grass Lake who had seen Clyde and Roberta going out from the inn to
the station on the morning of their departure from Grass Lake, that
all now recalled a "yellow bundle of sticks," fastened to his bag
which must have been the very tripod.</p>

<p>And then Burton Burleigh deciding that it might not really have
been the tripod, after all with which he had struck her but
possibly and even probably the somewhat heavier body of the camera
itself, since an edge of it would explain the wound on the top of
the head and the flat surface would explain the general wounds on
her face. And because of this conclusion, without any knowledge on
the part of Clyde, however, Mason securing divers from among the
woodsmen of the region and setting them to diving in the immediate
vicinity of the spot where Roberta's body had been found, with the
result that after an entire day's diving on the part of
six&mdash;and because of a promised and substantial reward, one
Jack Bogart arose with the very camera which Clyde, as the boat had
turned over, had let fall. Worse, after examination it proved to
contain a roll of films, which upon being submitted to an expert
chemist for development, showed finally to be a series of pictures
of Roberta, made on shore&mdash;one sitting on a log, a second
posed by the side of the boat on shore, a third reaching up toward
the branches of a tree&mdash;all very dim and water-soaked but
still decipherable. And the exact measurements of the broadest side
of the camera corresponding in a general way to the length and
breadth of the wounds upon Roberta's face, which caused it now to
seem positive that they had discovered the implement wherewith
Clyde had delivered the blows.</p>

<p>Yet no trace of blood upon the camera itself. And none upon the
side or bottom of the boat, which had been brought to Bridgeburg
for examination. And none upon the rug which had lain in the bottom
of the boat.</p>

<p>In Burton Burleigh there existed as sly a person as might have
been found in a score of such backwoods counties as this, and soon
he found himself meditating on how easy it would be, supposing
irrefragable evidence were necessary, for him or any one to cut a
finger and let it bleed on the rug or the side of the boat or the
edge of the camera. Also, how easy to take from the head of Roberta
two or three hairs and thread them between the sides of the camera,
or about the rowlock to which her veil had been attached. And after
due and secret meditation, he actually deciding to visit the Lutz
Brothers morgue and secure a few threads of Roberta's hair. For he
himself was convinced that Clyde had murdered the girl in cold
blood. And for want of a bit of incriminating proof, was such a
young, silent, vain crook as this to be allowed to escape? Not if
he himself had to twine the hairs about the rowlock or inside the
lid of the camera, and then call Mason's attention to them as
something overlooked!</p>

<p>And in consequence, upon the same day that Heit and Mason were
personally re-measuring the wounds upon Roberta's face and head,
Burleigh slyly threading two of Roberta's hairs in between the door
and the lens of the camera, so that Mason and Heit a little while
later unexpectedly coming upon them, and wondering why they had not
seen them before&mdash;nevertheless accepting them immediately as
conclusive evidence of Clyde's guilt. Indeed, Mason thereupon
announcing that in so far as he was concerned, his case was
complete. He had truly traced out every step in this crime and if
need be was prepared to go to trial on the morrow.</p>

<p>Yet, because of the very completeness of the testimony, deciding
for the present, at least, not to say anything in connection with
the camera&mdash;to seal, if possible, the mouth of every one who
knew. For, assuming that Clyde persisted in denying that he had
carried a camera, or that his own lawyer should be unaware of the
existence of such evidence, then how damning in court, and out of a
clear sky, to produce this camera, these photographs of Roberta
made by him, and the proof that the very measurements of one side
of the camera coincided with the size of the wounds upon her face!
How complete! How incriminating!</p>

<p>Also since he personally having gathered the testimony was the
one best fitted to present it, he decided to communicate with the
governor of the state for the purpose of obtaining a special term
of the Supreme Court for this district, with its accompanying
special session of the local grand jury, which would then be
subject to his call at any time. For with this granted, he would be
able to impanel a grand jury and in the event of a true bill being
returned against Clyde, then within a month or six weeks, proceed
to trial. Strictly to himself, however, he kept the fact that in
view of his own approaching nomination in the ensuing November
election this should all prove most opportune, since in the absence
of any such special term the case could not possibly be tried
before the succeeding regular January term of the Supreme Court, by
which time he would be out of office and although possibly elected
to the local judgeship still not able to try the case in person.
And in view of the state of public opinion, which was most bitterly
and vigorously anti-Clyde, a quick trial would seem fair and
logical to every one in this local world. For why delay? Why permit
such a criminal to sit about and speculate on some plan of escape?
And especially when his trial by him, Mason, was certain to rebound
to his legal and political and social fame the country over.</p>

<h3>Chapter 12</h3>

<p>And then out of the north woods a crime sensation of the first
magnitude, with all of those intriguingly colorful, and yet morally
and spiritually atrocious, elements&mdash;love, romance, wealth;
poverty, death. And at once picturesque accounts of where and how
Clyde had lived in Lycurgus, with whom he had been connected, how
he had managed to conceal his relations with one girl while
obviously planning to elope with another&mdash;being wired for and
published by that type of editor so quick to sense the national
news value of crimes such as this. And telegrams of inquiry pouring
in from New York, Chicago, Boston, Philadelphia, San Francisco and
other large American cities east and west, either to Mason direct
or the representatives of the Associated or United Press in this
area, asking for further and more complete details of the crime.
Who was this beautiful wealthy girl with whom it was said this
Griffiths was in love? Where did she live? What were Clyde's exact
relations with her? Yet Mason, over-awed by the wealth of the
Finchleys and the Griffiths, loath to part with Sondra's name,
simply asserting for the present that she was the daughter of a
very wealthy manufacturer in Lycurgus, whose name he did not care
to furnish&mdash;yet not hesitating to show the bundle of letters
carefully tied with a ribbon by Clyde.</p>

<p>But Roberta's letters on the other hand being described in
detail,&mdash; even excerpts of some of them&mdash;the more poetic
and gloomy being furnished the Press for use, for who was there to
protect her. And on their publication a wave of hatred for Clyde as
well as a wave of pity for her&mdash;the poor, lonely, country girl
who had had no one but him&mdash;and he cruel, faithless,&mdash;a
murderer even. Was not hanging too good for him? For en route to
and from Bear Lake, as well as since, Mason had pored over these
letters. And because of certain intensely moving passages relating
to her home life, her gloomy distress as to her future, her evident
loneliness and weariness of heart, he had been greatly moved, and
later had been able to convey this feeling to others&mdash;his wife
and Heit and the local newspapermen. So much so that the latter in
particular were sending from Bridgeburg vivid, if somewhat
distorted, descriptions of Clyde, his silence, his moodiness, and
his hard-heartedness.</p>

<p>And then a particularly romantic young reporter from The Star,
of Utica arriving at the home of the Aldens, there was immediately
given to the world a fairly accurate picture of the weary and
defeated Mrs. Alden, who, too exhausted to protest or complain,
merely contented herself with a sincere and graphic picture of
Roberta's devotion to her parents, her simple ways of living, her
modesty, morality, religious devotion&mdash;how once the local
pastor of the Methodist Church had said that she was the brightest
and prettiest and kindest girl he had ever known, and how for years
before leaving home she had been as her mother's own right hand.
And that undoubtedly because of her poverty and loneliness in
Lycurgus, she had been led to listen to the honeyed words of this
scoundrel, who, coming to her with promises of marriage, had lured
her into this unhallowed and, in her case, all but unbelievable
relationship which had led to her death. For she was good and pure
and sweet and kind always. "And to think that she is dead. I can't
believe it."</p>

<p>It was so that her mother was quoted.</p>

<p>"Only Monday a week ago she was about&mdash;a little depressed,
I thought, but smiling, and for some reason which I thought odd at
the time went all over the place Monday afternoon and evening,
looking at things and gathering some flowers. And then she came
over and put her arms around me and said: 'I wish I were a little
girl again, Mamma, and that you would take me in your arms and rock
me like you used to.' And I said, 'Why, Roberta, what makes you so
sad to-night, anyhow?' And she said, 'Oh, nothing. You know I'm
going back in the morning. And somehow I feel a little foolish
about it to-night.' And to think that it was this trip that was in
her mind. I suppose she had a premonition that all would not work
out as she had planned. And to think he struck my little girl, she
who never could harm anything, not even a fly." And here, in spite
of herself, and with the saddened Titus in the background, she
began to cry silently.</p>

<p>But from the Griffiths and other members of this local social
world, complete and almost unbreakable silence. For in so far as
Samuel Griffiths was concerned, it was impossible for him at first
either to grasp or believe that Clyde could be capable of such a
deed. What! That bland and rather timid and decidedly gentlemanly
youth, as he saw him, charged with murder? Being rather far from
Lycurgus at the time&mdash;Upper Saranac&mdash;where he was reached
with difficulty by Gilbert&mdash;he was almost unprepared to think,
let alone act. Why, how impossible! There must be some mistake
here. They must have confused Clyde with some one else.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Gilbert proceeding to explain that it was
unquestionably true, since the girl had worked in the factory under
Clyde, and the district attorney at Bridgeburg with whom he had
already been in communication had assured him that he was in
possession of letters which the dead girl had written to Clyde and
that Clyde did not attempt to deny them.</p>

<p>"Very well, then," countered Samuel. "Don't act hastily, and
above all, don't talk to anyone outside of Smillie or Gotboy until
I see you. Where's Brookhart?"&mdash;referring to Darrah Brookhart,
of counsel for Griffiths &amp; Company.</p>

<p>"He's in Boston to-day," returned his son. "I think he told me
last Friday that he wouldn't be back here until Monday or
Tuesday."</p>

<p>"Well, wire him that I want him to return at once. Incidentally,
have Smillie see if he can arrange with the editors of The Star and
Beacon down there to suspend any comment until I get back. I'll be
down in the morning. Also tell him to get in the car and run up
there" (Bridgeburg) "to-day if he can. I must know from first hand
all there is to know. Have him see Clyde if he can, also this
district attorney, and bring down any news that he can get. And all
the newspapers. I want to see for myself what has been
published."</p>

<p>And at approximately the same time, in the home of the Finchleys
on Fourth Lake, Sondra herself, after forty-eight hours of most
macerating thoughts spent brooding on the astounding climax which
had put a period to all her girlish fancies in regard to Clyde,
deciding at last to confess all to her father, to whom she was more
drawn than to her mother. And accordingly approaching him in the
library, where usually he sat after dinner, reading or considering
his various affairs. But having come within earshot of him,
beginning to sob, for truly she was stricken in the matter of her
love for Clyde, as well as her various vanities and illusions in
regard to her own high position, the scandal that was about to fall
on her and her family. Oh, what would her mother say now, after all
her warnings? And her father? And Gilbert Griffiths and his
affianced bride? And the Cranstons, who except for her influence
over Bertine, would never have been drawn into this intimacy with
Clyde?</p>

<p>Her sobs arresting her father's attention, he at once paused to
look up, the meaning of this quite beyond him. Yet instantly
sensing something very dreadful, gathering her up in his arms, and
consolingly murmuring: "There, there! For heaven's sake, what's
happened to my little girl now? Who's done what and why?" And then,
with a decidedly amazed and shaken expression, listening to a
complete confession of all that had occurred thus far&mdash;the
first meeting with Clyde, her interest in him, the attitude of the
Griffiths, her letters, her love, and then this&mdash;this awful
accusation and arrest. And if it were true! And her name were used,
and her daddy's! And once more she fell to weeping as though her
heart would break, yet knowing full well that in the end she would
have her father's sympathy and forgiveness, whatever his subsequent
suffering and mood.</p>

<p>And at once Finchley, accustomed to peace and order and tact and
sense in his own home, looking at his daughter in an astounded and
critical and yet not uncharitable way, and exclaiming: "Well, well,
of all things! Well, I'll be damned! I am amazed, my dear! I am
astounded! This is a little too much, I must say. Accused of
murder! And with letters of yours in your own handwriting, you say,
in his possession, or in the hands of this district attorney, for
all we know by now. Tst! Tst! Tst! Damned foolish, Sondra, damned
foolish! Your mother has been talking to me for months about this,
and you know I was taking your word for it against hers. And now
see what's happened! Why couldn't you have told me or listened to
her? Why couldn't you have talked all this over with me before
going so far? I thought we understood each other, you and I. Your
mother and I have always acted for your own good, haven't we? You
know that. Besides, I certainly thought you had better sense.
Really, I did. But a murder case, and you connected with it! My
God!"</p>

<p>He got up, a handsome blond man in carefully made clothes, and
paced the floor, snapping his fingers irritably, while Sondra
continued to weep. Suddenly, ceasing his walking, he turned again
toward her and resumed with: "But, there, there! There's no use
crying over it. Crying isn't going to fix it. Of course, we may be
able to live it down in some way. I don't know. I don't know. I
can't guess what effect this is likely to have on you personally.
But one thing is sure. We do want to know something about those
letters."</p>

<p>And forthwith, and while Sondra wept on, he proceeded first to
call his wife in order to explain the nature of the blow&mdash;a
social blow that was to lurk in her memory as a shadow for the rest
of her years&mdash;and next to call up Legare Atterbury, lawyer,
state senator, chairman of the Republican State Central Committee
and his own private counsel for years past, to whom he explained
the amazing difficulty in which his daughter now found herself.
Also to inquire what was the most advisable thing to be done.</p>

<p>"Well, let me see," came from Atterbury, "I wouldn't worry very
much if I were you, Mr. Finchley. I think I can do something to
straighten this out for you before any real public damage is done.
Now, let me see. Who is the district attorney of Cataraqui County,
anyhow? I'll have to look that up and get in touch with him and
call you back. But never mind, I promise you I'll be able to do
something&mdash;keep the letters out of the papers, anyhow. Maybe
out of the trial&mdash;I'm not sure&mdash;but I am sure I can fix
it so that her name will not be mentioned, so don't worry."</p>

<p>And then Atterbury in turn calling up Mason, whose name he found
in his lawyers' directory, and at once arranging for a conference
with him, since Mason seemed to think that the letters were most
vital to his case, although he was so much overawed by Atterbury's
voice that he was quick to explain that by no means had he planned
as yet to use publicly the name of Sondra or the letters either,
but rather to reserve their actuality for the private inspection of
the grand jury, unless Clyde should choose to confess and avoid a
trial.</p>

<p>But Atterbury, after referring back to Finchley and finding him
opposed to any use of the letters whatsoever, or Sondra's name
either, assuring him that on the morrow or the day after he would
himself proceed to Bridgeburg with some plans and political
information which might cause Mason to think twice before he so
much as considered referring to Sondra in any public way.</p>

<p>And then after due consideration by the Finchley family, it was
decided that at once, and without explanation or apology to any
one, Mrs. Finchley, Stuart and Sondra should leave for the Maine
coast or any place satisfactory to them. Finchley himself proposed
to return to Lycurgus and Albany. It was not wise for any of them
to be about where they could be reached by reporters or questioned
by friends. And forthwith, a hegira of the Finchleys to
Narragansett, where under the name of Wilson they secluded
themselves for the next six weeks. Also, and because of the same
cause the immediate removal of the Cranstons to one of the Thousand
Islands, where there was a summer colony not entirely
unsatisfactory to their fancy. But on the part of the Baggotts and
the Harriets, the contention that they were not sufficiently
incriminated to bother and so remaining exactly where they were at
Twelfth Lake. But all talking of Clyde and Sondra&mdash;this
horrible crime and the probable social destruction of all those who
had in any way been thus innocently defiled by it.</p>

<p>And in the interim, Smillie, as directed by Griffiths,
proceeding to Bridgeburg, and after two long hours with Mason,
calling at the jail to see Clyde. And because of authorization from
Mason being permitted to see him quite alone in his cell. Smillie
having explained that it was not the intention of the Griffiths to
try to set up any defense for Clyde, but rather to discover whether
under the circumstances there was a possibility for a defense,
Mason had urged upon him the wisdom of persuading Clyde to confess,
since, as he insisted, there was not the slightest doubt as to his
guilt, and a trial would but cost the county money without result
to Clyde&mdash; whereas if he chose to confess, there might be some
undeveloped reasons for clemency&mdash;at any rate, a great social
scandal prevented from being aired in the papers.</p>

<p>And thereupon Smillie proceeding to Clyde in his cell where
brooding most darkly and hopelessly he was wondering how to do. Yet
at the mere mention of Smillie's name shrinking as though struck.
The Griffiths&mdash;Samuel Griffiths and Gilbert! Their personal
representative. And now what would he say? For no doubt, as he now
argued with himself, Smillie, having talked with Mason, would think
him guilty. And what was he to say now? What sort of a story
tell&mdash;the truth or what? But without much time to think, for
even while he was trying to do so Smillie had been ushered into his
presence. And then moistening his dry lips with his tongue, he
could only achieve, "Why, how do you do, Mr. Smillie?" to which the
latter replied, with a mock geniality, "Why, hello, Clyde,
certainly sorry to see you tied up in a place like this." And then
continuing: "The papers and the district attorney over here are
full of a lot of stuff about some trouble you're in, but I suppose
there can't be much to it&mdash;there must be some mistake, of
course. And that's what I'm up here to find out. Your uncle
telephoned me this morning that I was to come up and see you to
find out how they come to be holding you. Of course, you can
understand how they feel down there. So they wanted me to come up
and get the straight of it so as to get the charge dismissed, if
possible&mdash;so now if you'll just let me know the ins and outs
of this&mdash;you know&mdash;that is&mdash;"</p>

<p>He paused there, confident because of what the district attorney
had just told him, as well as Clyde's peculiarly nervous and
recessive manner, that he would not have very much that was
exculpatory to reveal.</p>

<p>And Clyde, after moistening his lips once more, beginning with:
"I suppose things do look pretty bad for me, Mr. Smillie. I didn't
think at the time that I met Miss Alden that I would ever get into
such a scrape as this. But I didn't kill her, and that's the God's
truth. I never even wanted to kill her or take her up to that lake
in the first place. And that's the truth, and that's what I told
the district attorney. I know he has some letters from her to me,
but they only show that she wanted me to go away with her&mdash;not
that I wanted to go with her at all&mdash;"</p>

<p>He paused, hoping that Smillie would stamp this with his
approval of faith. And Smillie, noting the agreement between his
and Mason's assertions, yet anxious to placate him, returned: "Yes,
I know. He was just showing them to me."</p>

<p>"I knew he would," continued Clyde, weakly. "But you know how it
is sometimes, Mr. Smillie," his voice, because of his fears that
the sheriff or Kraut were listening, pitched very low. "A man can
get in a jam with a girl when he never even intended to at first.
You know that yourself. I did like Roberta at first, and that's the
truth, and I did get in with her just as those letters show. But
you know that rule they have down there, that no one in charge of a
department can have anything to do with any of the women under him.
Well, that's what started all the trouble for me, I guess. I was
afraid to let any one know about it in the first place, you
see."</p>

<p>"Oh, I see."</p>

<p>And so by degrees, and growing less and less tense as he
proceeded, since Smillie appeared to be listening with sympathy, he
now outlined most of the steps of his early intimacy with Roberta,
together with his present defense. But with no word as to the
camera, or the two hats or the lost suit, which things were
constantly and enormously troubling him. How could he ever explain
these, really? And with Smillie at the conclusion of this and
because of what Mason had told him, asking: "But what about those
two hats, Clyde? This man over here was telling me that you admit
to having two straw hats&mdash;the one found on the lake and the
one you wore away from there."</p>

<p>And Clyde, forced to say something, yet not knowing what,
replying: "But they're wrong as to my wearing a straw hat away from
there, Mr. Smillie, it was a cap."</p>

<p>"I see. But still you did have a straw hat up at Bear Lake, he
tells me."</p>

<p>"Yes, I had one there, but as I told him, that was the one I had
with me when I went up to the Cranstons' the first time. I told him
that. I forgot it and left it there."</p>

<p>"Oh, I see. But now there was something about a suit&mdash;a
gray one, I believe&mdash;that he says you were seen wearing up
there but that he can't find now? Were you wearing one?"</p>

<p>"No. I was wearing the blue suit I had on when I came down here.
They've taken that away now and given me this one."</p>

<p>"But he says that you say you had it dry-cleaned at Sharon but
that he can't find any one there who knows anything about it. How
about that? Did you have it dry-cleaned there?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"By whom?"</p>

<p>"Well, I can't just remember now. But I think I can find the man
if I were to go up there again&mdash;he's near the depot," but at
the same time looking down and away from Smillie.</p>

<p>And then Smillie, like Mason before him, proceeding to ask about
the bag in the boat, and whether it had not been possible, if he
could swim to shore with his shoes and suit on, for him to have
swam to Roberta and assisted her to cling to the overturned boat.
And Clyde explaining, as before, that he was afraid of being
dragged down, but adding now, for the first time, that he had
called to her to hang on to the boat, whereas previously he had
said that the boat drifted away from them. And Smillie recalled
that Mason had told him this. Also, in connection with Clyde's
story of the wind blowing his hat off, Mason had said he could
prove by witnesses, as well as the U. S. Government reports, that
there was not a breath of air stirring on that most halcyon day.
And so, plainly, Clyde was lying. His story was too thin. Yet
Smillie, not wishing to embarrass him, kept saying: "Oh, I see,"
or, "To be sure," or "That's the way it was, was it?"</p>

<p>And then finally asking about the marks on Roberta's face and
head. For Mason had called his attention to them and insisted that
no blow from a boat would make both abrasions. But Clyde sure that
the boat had only struck her once and that all the bruises had come
from that or else he could not guess from what they had come. But
then beginning to see how hopeless was all this explanation. For it
was so plain from his restless, troubled manner that Smillie did
not believe him. Quite obviously he considered his not having aided
Roberta as dastardly&mdash;a thin excuse for letting her die.</p>

<p>And so, too weary and disheartened to lie more, finally ceasing.
And Smillie, too sorry and disturbed to wish to catechize or
confuse him further, fidgeting and fumbling and finally declaring:
"Well, I'm afraid I'll have to be going now, Clyde. The roads are
pretty bad between here and Sharon. But I've been mighty glad to
hear your side of it. And I'll present it to your uncle just as you
have told it to me. But in the meantime, if I were you, I wouldn't
do any more talking than I could help&mdash;not until you hear
further from me. I was instructed to find an attorney up here to
handle this case for you, if I could, but since it's late and Mr.
Brookhart, our chief counsel, will be back to-morrow, I think I'll
just wait until I can talk to him. So if you'll take my advice,
you'll just not say anything until you hear from him or me. Either
he'll come or he'll send some one&mdash;he'll bring a letter from
me, whoever he is, and then he'll advise you."</p>

<p>And with this parting admonition, leaving Clyde to his thoughts
and himself feeling no least doubt of his guilt and that nothing
less than the Griffiths' millions, if so they chose to spend them,
could save him from a fate which was no doubt due him.</p>

<h3>Chapter 13</h3>

<p>And then on the following morning Samuel Griffiths, with his own
son Gilbert standing by, in the large drawing room of their Wykeagy
Avenue mansion, listening to Smillie's report of his conference
with Clyde and Mason. And Smillie reporting all he had heard and
seen. And with Gilbert Griffiths, unbelievably shaken and
infuriated by all this, exclaiming at one point:</p>

<p>"Why, the little devil! The little beast! But what did I tell
you, Dad? Didn't I warn you against bringing him on?"</p>

<p>And Samuel Griffiths after meditating on this reference to his
earlier sympathetic folly now giving Gilbert a most suggestive and
intensely troubled look, which said: Are we here to discuss the
folly of my original, if foolish, good intentions, or the present
crisis? And Gilbert thinking: The murderer! And that wretched
little show-off, Sondra Finchley, trying to make something of him
in order to spite me, Gilbert, principally, and so getting herself
smirched. The little fool! But it served her right. She would get
her share of this now. Only it would cause him and his father and
all of them infinite trouble also. For was this not an ineradicable
stain which was likely to defile all&mdash;himself, his fiancee,
Bella, Myra, his parents&mdash;and perhaps cost them their position
here in Lycurgus society? The tragedy! Maybe an execution! And in
this family!</p>

<p>Yet Samuel Griffiths, on his part, going back in his mind to all
that had occurred since Clyde had arrived in Lycurgus.</p>

<p>His being left to work in that basement at first and ignored by
the family. Left to his own devices for fully eight months. Might
not that have been at least a contributing cause to all this
horror? And then being put over all those girls! Was not that a
mistake? He could see all this now clearly, although by no means
condoning Clyde's deed in any way&mdash;far from it. The
wretchedness of such a mind as that&mdash;the ungoverned and carnal
desires! The uncontrollable brutality of seducing that girl and
then because of Sondra&mdash;the pleasant, agreeable little
Sondra&mdash;plotting to get rid of her! And now in jail, and
offering no better explanation of all the amazing circumstances, as
reported by Smillie, than that he had not intended to kill her at
all&mdash;had not even plotted to do so&mdash;that the wind had
blown his hat off! How impossibly weak! And with no suitable
explanation for the two hats, or the missing suit, or of not going
to the aid of the drowning girl. And those unexplained marks on her
face. How strongly all these things pointed to his guilt.</p>

<p>"For God's sake," exclaimed Gilbert, "hasn't he anything better
than that to offer, the little fool!" And Smillie replied that that
was all he could get him to say, and that Mr. Mason was absolutely
and quite dispassionately convinced of his guilt. "Dreadful!
Dreadful!" put in Samuel. "I really can't grasp it yet. I can't! It
doesn't seem possible that any one of my blood could be guilty of
such a thing!" And then getting up and walking the floor in real
and crushing distress and fear. His family! Gilbert and his future!
Bella, with all her ambitions and dreams! And Sondra! And
Finchley!</p>

<p>He clinched his hands. He knitted his brows and tightened his
lips. He looked at Smillie, who, immaculate and sleek, showed
nevertheless the immense strain that was on him, shaking his head
dismally whenever Griffiths looked at him.</p>

<p>And then after nearly an hour and a half more of such
questioning and requestioning as to the possibility of some other
interpretation than the data furnished by Smillie would permit,
Griffiths, senior, pausing and declaring: "Well, it does look bad,
I must say. Still, in the face of what you tell me, I can't find it
in me to condemn completely without more knowledge than we have
here. There may be some other facts not as yet come to
light&mdash;he won't talk, you say, about most things&mdash;some
little details we don't know about&mdash;some slight excuse of some
kind&mdash;for without that this does appear to be a most atrocious
crime. Has Mr. Brookhart got in from Boston?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, he's here," replied Gilbert. "He telephoned Mr.
Smillie."</p>

<p>"Well, have him come out here at two this afternoon to see me.
I'm too tired to talk more about this right now. Tell him all that
you have told me, Smillie. And then come back here with him at two.
It may be that he will have some suggestion to make that will be of
value to us, although just what I can't see. Only one thing I want
to say&mdash;I hope he isn't guilty. And I want every proper step
taken to discover whether he is or not, and if not, to defend him
to the limit of the law. But no more than that. No trying to save
anybody who is guilty of such a thing as this&mdash;no, no,
no!&mdash;not even if he is my nephew! Not me! I'm not that kind of
a man! Trouble or no trouble&mdash;disgrace or no
disgrace&mdash;I'll do what I can to help him if he's
innocent&mdash;if there's even the faintest reason for believing
so. But guilty? No! Never! If this boy is really guilty, he'll have
to take the consequences. Not a dollar&mdash;not a penny&mdash;of
my money will I devote to any one who could be guilty of such a
crime, even if he is my nephew!"</p>

<p>And turning and slowly and heavily moving toward the rear
staircase, while Smillie, wide-eyed, gazed after him in awe. The
power of him! The decision of him! The fairness of him in such a
deadly crisis! And Gilbert equally impressed, also sitting and
staring. His father was a man, really. He might be cruelly wounded
and distressed, but, unlike himself, he was neither petty nor
revengeful.</p>

<p>And next Mr. Darrah Brookhart, a large, well-dressed, well-fed,
ponderous and cautious corporation lawyer, with one eye half
concealed by a drooping lid and his stomach rather protuberant,
giving one the impression of being mentally if not exactly
physically suspended, balloon-wise, in some highly rarefied
atmosphere where he was moved easily hither and yon by the lightest
breath of previous legal interpretations or decisions of any kind.
In the absence of additional facts, the guilt of Clyde (to him)
seemed obvious. Or, waiving that, as he saw it after carefully
listening to Smillie's recounting of all the suspicious and
incriminating circumstances, he would think it very difficult to
construct an even partially satisfactory defense, unless there were
some facts favoring Clyde which had not thus far appeared. Those
two hats, that bag&mdash;his slipping away like that. Those
letters. But he would prefer to read them. For upon the face of the
data so far, unquestionably public sentiment would be all against
Clyde and in favor of the dead girl and her poverty and her class,
a situation which made a favorable verdict in such a backwoods
county seat as Bridgeburg almost impossible. For Clyde, although
himself poor, was the nephew of a rich man and hitherto in good
standing in Lycurgus society. That would most certainly tend to
prejudice country-born people against him. It would probably be
better to ask for a change of venue so as to nullify the force of
such a prejudice.</p>

<p>On the other hand, without first sending a trained
cross-examiner to Clyde&mdash;one, who being about to undertake the
defense should be able to extract the facts from him on the plea
that on his truthful answers depended his life&mdash;he would not
be able to say whether there was any hope or not. In his office was
a certain Mr. Catchuman, a very able man, who might be sent on such
a mission and on whose final report one could base a reasonable
opinion. However, there were now various other aspects of such a
case as this which, in his estimation, needed to be carefully
looked into and decided upon. For, of course, as Mr. Griffiths and
his son so well knew, in Utica, New York City, Albany (and now that
he came to think of it, more particularly in Albany, where were two
brothers, Canavan &amp; Canavan, most able if dubious individuals),
there were criminal lawyers deeply versed in the abstrusities and
tricks of the criminal law. And any of them&mdash;no
doubt&mdash;for a sufficient retainer, and irrespective of the
primary look of a situation of this kind, might be induced to
undertake such a defense. And, no doubt, via change of venue,
motions, appeals, etc., they might and no doubt would be able to
delay and eventually effect an ultimate verdict of something less
than death, if such were the wish of the head of this very
important family. On the other hand, there was the undeniable fact
that such a hotly contested trial as this would most assuredly
prove to be would result in an enormous amount of publicity, and
did Mr. Samuel Griffiths want that? For again, under such
circumstances, was it not likely to be said, if most unjustly, of
course, that he was using his great wealth to frustrate justice?
The public was so prejudiced against wealth in such cases. Yet,
some sort of a defense on the part of the Griffiths would certainly
be expected by the public, whether subsequently the same necessity
for such defense was criticized by them or not.</p>

<p>And in consequence, it was now necessary for Mr. Griffiths and
his son to decide how they would prefer to proceed&mdash;whether
with very distinguished criminal lawyers such as the two he had
just named, or with less forceful counsel, or none. For, of course,
it would be possible, and that quite inconspicuously, to supply
Clyde with a capable and yet thoroughly conservative trial
lawyer&mdash;some one residing and practising in Bridgeburg
possibly&mdash;whose duty it would be to see that all blatant and
unjustified reference to the family on the part of the newspapers
was minimized.</p>

<p>And so, after three more hours of conference, it was finally
decided by Samuel himself that at once Mr. Brookhart was to
despatch his Mr. Catchuman to Bridgeburg to interview Clyde, and
thereafter, whatever his conclusions as to his guilt or innocence,
he was to select from the local array of legal talent&mdash;for the
present, anyhow&mdash;such a lawyer as would best represent Clyde
fairly. Yet with no assurances of means or encouragement to do more
than extract from Clyde the true details of his relationship to
this charge. And those once ascertained to center upon such a
defense as would most honestly tend to establish only such facts as
were honestly favorable to Clyde&mdash;in short, in no way, either
by legal chicane or casuistry or trickery of any kind, to seek to
establish a false innocence and so defeat the ends of justice.</p>

<h3>Chapter 14</h3>

<p>Mr. Catchuman did not prove by any means to be the one to
extract from Clyde anything more than had either Mason or Smillie.
Although shrewd to a degree in piecing together out of the muddled
statements of another such data as seemed most probable, still he
was not so successful in the realm of the emotions, as was
necessary in the case of Clyde. He was too legal, chilling&mdash;
unemotional. And in consequence, after grilling Clyde for four long
hours one hot July afternoon, he was eventually compelled to desist
with the feeling that as a plotter of crime Clyde was probably the
most arresting example of feeble and blundering incapacity he had
ever met.</p>

<p>For since Smillie's departure Mason had proceeded to the shores
of Big Bittern with Clyde. And there discovered the tripod and
camera. Also listened to more of Clyde's lies. And as he now
explained to Catchuman that, while Clyde denied owning a camera,
nevertheless he had proof that he did own one and had taken it with
him when he left Lycurgus. Yet when confronted with this fact by
Catchuman, as the latter now noticed, Clyde had nothing to say
other than that he had not taken a camera with him and that the
tripod found was not the one belonging to any camera of his&mdash;a
lie which so irritated Catchuman that he decided not to argue with
him further.</p>

<p>At the same time, however, Brookhart having instructed him that,
whatever his personal conclusions in regard to Clyde, a lawyer of
sorts was indispensable&mdash;the charity, if not the honor, of the
Griffiths being this much involved, the western Griffiths, as
Brookhart had already explained to him, having nothing and not
being wanted in the case anyhow&mdash;he decided that he must find
one before leaving. In consequence, and without any knowledge of
the local political situation, he proceeded to the office of Ira
Kellogg, president of the Cataraqui County National Bank, who,
although Catchuman did not know it, was high in the councils of the
Democratic organization. And because of his religious and moral
views, this same Kellogg was already highly incensed and irritated
by the crime of which Clyde was accused. On the other hand,
however, because as he well knew this case was likely to pave the
way for an additional Republican sweep at the approaching
primaries, he was not blind to the fact that some reducing
opposition to Mason might not be amiss. Fate seemed too obviously
to be favoring the Republican machine in the person of and crime
committed by Clyde.</p>

<p>For since the discovery of this murder, Mason had been basking
in such publicity and even nation-wide notoriety as had not
befallen any district attorney of this region in years and years.
Newspaper correspondents and reporters and illustrators from such
distant cities as Buffalo, Rochester, Chicago, New York and Boston,
were already arriving as everybody knew or saw, to either interview
or make sketches or take photos of Clyde, Mason, the surviving
members of the Alden family, et cetera, while locally Mason was the
recipient of undiluted praise, even the Democratic voters in the
county joining with the Republicans in assuring each other that
Mason was all right, that he was handling this young murderer in
the way that he deserved to be handled, and that neither the wealth
of the Griffiths nor of the family of that rich girl whom he
appeared to have been trying to capture, was influencing this young
tribune of the people in the least. He was a real attorney. He had
not "allowed any grass to grow under his feet, you bet."</p>

<p>Indeed previous to Catchuman's visit, a coroner's jury had been
called, with Mason attending and directing even, the verdict being
that the dead girl had come to her death through a plot devised and
executed by one Clyde Griffiths who was then and there in the
county jail of Bridgeburg and that he be held to await the verdict
of the County Grand Jury to whom his crime was soon to be
presented. And Mason, through an appeal to the Governor, as all now
knew was planning to secure a special sitting of the Supreme Court,
which would naturally involve an immediate session of the County
Grand Jury in order to hear the evidence and either indict or
discharge Clyde. And now, Catchuman arriving to inquire where he
was likely to find a local lawyer of real ability who could be
trusted to erect some sort of a defense for Clyde. And immediately
as an offset to all this there popped into Kellogg's mind the name
and reputation of one Hon. Alvin Belknap, of Belknap and Jephson,
of this same city&mdash;an individual who had been twice state
senator, three times Democratic assemblyman from this region, and
more recently looked upon by various Democratic politicians as one
who would be favored with higher honors as soon as it was possible
to arrange an issue which would permit the Democrats to enter into
local office. In fact, only three years before, in a contest with
Mason for the district attorneyship, this same Belknap had run
closer to victory than any other candidate on the Democratic
ticket. Indeed, so rounded a man was he politically that this year
he had been slated for that very county judgeship nomination which
Mason had in view. And but for this sudden and most amazing
development in connection with Clyde, it had been quite generally
assumed that Belknap, once nominated, would be elected. And
although Mr. Kellogg did not quite trouble to explain to Catchuman
all the complicated details of this very interesting political
situation, he did explain that Mr. Belknap was a very exceptional
man, almost the ideal one, if one were looking for an opponent to
Mason.</p>

<p>And with this slight introduction, Kellogg now offered
personally to conduct Catchuman to Belknap and Jephson's office,
just across the way in the Bowers Block.</p>

<p>And then knocking at Belknap's door, they were admitted by a
brisk, medium-sized and most engaging-looking man of about
forty-eight, whose gray-blue eyes at once fixed themselves in the
mind of Catchuman as the psychic windows of a decidedly shrewd if
not altogether masterful and broad-gauge man. For Belknap was
inclined to carry himself with an air which all were inclined to
respect. He was a college graduate, and in his youth because of his
looks, his means, and his local social position (his father had
been a judge as well as a national senator from here), he had seen
so much of what might be called near-city life that all those
gaucheries as well as sex-inhibitions and sex-longings which still
so greatly troubled and motivated and even marked a man like Mason
had long since been covered with an easy manner and social
understanding which made him fairly capable of grasping any
reasonable moral or social complication which life was prepared to
offer.</p>

<p>Indeed he was one who naturally would approach a case such as
Clyde's with less vehemence and fever than did Mason. For once, in
his twentieth year, he himself had been trapped between two girls,
with one of whom he was merely playing while being seriously in
love with the other. And having seduced the first and being
confronted with an engagement or flight, he had chosen flight. But
not before laying the matter before his father, by whom he was
advised to take a vacation, during which time the services of the
family doctor were engaged with the result that for a thousand
dollars and expenses necessary to house the pregnant girl in Utica,
the father had finally extricated his son and made possible his
return, and eventual marriage to the other girl.</p>

<p>And therefore, while by no means sympathizing with the more
cruel and drastic phases of Clyde's attempt at escape&mdash;as so
far charged (never in all the years of his law practice had he been
able to grasp the psychology of a murderer) still because of the
rumored existence and love influence of a rich girl whose name had
not as yet been divulged he was inclined to suspect that Clyde had
been emotionally betrayed or bewitched. Was he not poor and vain
and ambitious? He had heard so: had even been thinking that
he&mdash;the local political situation being what it was might
advantageously to himself&mdash;and perhaps most disruptingly to
the dreams of Mr. Mason be able to construct a defense&mdash;or at
least a series of legal contentions and delays which might make it
not so easy for Mr. Mason to walk away with the county judgeship as
he imagined. Might it not, by brisk, legal moves now&mdash;and even
in the face of this rising public sentiment, or because of
it,&mdash;be possible to ask for a change of venue&mdash;or time to
develop new evidence in which case a trial might not occur before
Mr. Mason was out of office. He and his young and somewhat new
associate, Mr. Reuben Jephson, of quite recently the state of
Vermont, had been thinking of it.</p>

<p>And now Mr. Catchuman accompanied by Mr. Kellogg. And thereupon
a conference with Mr. Catchuman and Mr. Kellogg, with the latter
arguing quite politically the wisdom of his undertaking such a
defense. And his own interest in the case being what it was, he was
not long in deciding, after a conference with his younger
associate, that he would. In the long run it could not possibly
injure him politically, however the public might feel about it
now.</p>

<p>And then Catchuman having handed over a retainer to Belknap as
well as a letter introducing him to Clyde, Belknap had Jephson call
up Mason to inform him that Belknap &amp; Jephson, as counsel for
Samuel Griffiths on behalf of his nephew, would require of him a
detailed written report of all the charges as well as all the
evidence thus far accumulated, the minutes of the autopsy and the
report of the coroner's inquest. Also information as to whether any
appeal for a special term of the Supreme Court had as yet been
acted upon, and if so what judge had been named to sit, and when
and where the Grand Jury would be gathered. Incidentally, he said,
Messrs. Belknap and Jephson, having heard that Miss Alden's body
had been sent to her home for burial, would request at once a
counsel's agreement whereby it might be exhumed in order that other
doctors now to be called by the defense might be permitted to
examine it&mdash;a proposition which Mason at once sought to oppose
but finally agreed to rather than submit to an order from a Supreme
Court judge.</p>

<p>These details having been settled, Belknap announced that he was
going over to the jail to see Clyde. It was late and he had had no
dinner, and might get none now, but he wanted to have a "heart to
heart" with this youth, whom Catchuman informed him he would find
very difficult. But Belknap, buoyed up as he was by his opposition
to Mason, his conviction that he was in a good mental state to
understand Clyde, was in a high degree of legal curiosity. The
romance and drama of this crime! What sort of a girl was this
Sondra Finchley, of whom he had already heard through secret
channels? And could she by any chance be brought to Clyde's
defense? He had already understood that her name was not to be
mentioned&mdash;high politics demanding this. He was really most
eager to talk to this sly and ambitious and futile youth.</p>

<p>However, on reaching the jail, and after showing Sheriff Slack a
letter from Catchuman and asking as a special favor to himself that
he be taken upstairs to some place near Clyde's cell in order that,
unannounced, he might first observe Clyde, he was quietly led to
the second floor and, the outside door leading to the corridor
which faced Clyde's cell being opened for him, allowed to enter
there alone. And then walking to within a few feet of Clyde's cell
he was able to view him&mdash;at the moment lying face down on his
iron cot, his arms above his head, a tray of untouched food
standing in the aperture, his body sprawled and limp. For, since
Catchuman's departure, and his second failure to convince any one
of his futile and meaningless lies, he was more despondent than
ever. In fact, so low was his condition that he was actually
crying, his shoulders heaving above his silent emotion. At sight of
this, and remembering his own youthful escapades, Belknap now felt
intensely sorry for him. No soulless murderer, as he saw it, would
cry.</p>

<p>Approaching Clyde's cell door, after a pause, he began with:
"Come, come, Clyde! This will never do. You mustn't give up like
this. Your case mayn't be as hopeless as you think. Wouldn't you
like to sit up and talk to a lawyer fellow who thinks he might be
able to do something for you? Belknap is my name&mdash;Alvin
Belknap. I live right here in Bridgeburg and I have been sent over
by that other fellow who was here a while ago&mdash;Catchuman,
wasn't that his name? You didn't get along with him so very well,
did you? Well, I didn't either. He's not our kind, I guess. But
here's a letter from him authorizing me to represent you. Want to
see it?" He poked it genially and authoritatively through the
narrow bars toward which Clyde, now curious and dubious,
approached. For there was something so whole-hearted and unusual
and seemingly sympathetic and understanding in this man's voice
that Clyde took courage. And without hesitancy, therefore, he took
the letter and looked at it, then returned it with a smile.</p>

<p>"There, I thought so," went on Belknap, most convincingly and
pleased with his effect, which he credited entirely to his own
magnetism and charm. "That's better. I know we're going to get
along. I can feel it. You are going to be able to talk to me as
easily and truthfully as you would to your mother. And without any
fear that any word of anything you ever tell me is going to reach
another ear, unless you want it to, see? For I'm going to be your
lawyer, Clyde, if you'll let me, and you're going to be my client,
and we're going to sit down together to-morrow, or whenever you say
so, and you're going to tell me all you think I ought to know, and
I'm going to tell you what I think I ought to know, and whether I'm
going to be able to help you. And I'm going to prove to you that in
every way that you help me, you're helping yourself, see? And I'm
going to do my damnedest to get you out of this. Now, how's that,
Clyde?"</p>

<p>He smiled most encouragingly and sympathetically&mdash;even
affectionately. And Clyde, feeling for the first time since his
arrival here that he had found some one in whom he could possibly
confide without danger, was already thinking it might be best if he
should tell this man all&mdash;everything&mdash;he could not have
said why, quite, but he liked him. In a quick, if dim way he felt
that this man understood and might even sympathize with him, if he
knew all or nearly all. And after Belknap had detailed how eager
this enemy of his&mdash;Mason&mdash;was to convict him, and how, if
he could but devise a reasonable defense, he was sure he could
delay the case until this man was out of office, Clyde announced
that if he would give him the night to think it all out, to-morrow
or any time he chose to come back, he would tell him all.</p>

<p>And then, the next day Belknap sitting on a stool and munching
chocolate bars, listened while Clyde before him on his iron cot,
poured forth his story&mdash;all the details of his life since
arriving at Lycurgus&mdash;how and why he had come there, the
incident of the slain child in Kansas City, without, however,
mention of the clipping which he himself had preserved and then
forgotten; his meeting with Roberta, and his desire for her; her
pregnancy and how he had sought to get her out of it&mdash;on and
on until, she having threatened to expose him, he had at last, and
in great distress and fright, found the item in The Times-Union and
had sought to emulate that in action. But he had never plotted it
personally, as Belknap was to understand. Nor had he intentionally
killed her at the last. No, he had not. Mr. Belknap must believe
that, whatever else he thought. He had never deliberately struck
her. No, no, no! It had been an accident. There had been a camera,
and the tripod reported to have been found by Mason was
unquestionably his tripod. Also, he had hidden it under a log,
after accidentally striking Roberta with the camera and then seeing
that sink under the waters, where no doubt it still was, and with
pictures of himself and Roberta on the film it contained, if they
were not dissolved by the water. But he had not struck her
intentionally. No&mdash;he had not. She had approached and he had
struck, but not intentionally. The boat had upset. And then as
nearly as he could, he described how before that he had seemed to
be in a trance almost, because having gone so far he could go no
farther.</p>

<p>But in the meantime, Belknap, himself finally wearied and
confused by this strange story, the impossibility as he now saw it
of submitting to, let alone convincing, any ordinary backwoods jury
of this region, of the innocence of these dark and bitter plans and
deeds, finally in great weariness and uncertainty and mental
confusion, even, getting up and placing his hands on Clyde's
shoulders, saying: "Well, that'll be enough of this for to-day,
Clyde, I think. I see how you felt and how it all came
about&mdash;also I see how tired you are, and I'm mighty glad
you've been able to give me the straight of this, because I know
how hard it's been for you to do it. But I don't want you to talk
any more now. There are going to be other days, and I have a few
things I want to attend to before I take up some of the minor
phases of this with you to-morrow or next day. Just you sleep and
rest for the present. You'll need all you can get for the work both
of us will have to do a little later. But just now, you're not to
worry, because there's no need of it, do you see? I'll get you out
of this&mdash;or we will&mdash;my partner and I. I have a partner
that I'm going to bring around here presently. You'll like him,
too. But there are one or two things that I want you to think about
and stick to&mdash;and one of these is that you're not to let
anybody frighten you into anything, because either myself or my
partner will be around here once a day anyhow, and anything you
have to say or want to know you can say or find out from us. Next
you're not to talk to anybody&mdash;Mason, the sheriff, these
jailers, no one&mdash; unless I tell you to. No one, do you hear!
And above all things, don't cry any more. For if you are as
innocent as an angel, or as black as the devil himself, the worst
thing you can do is to cry before any one. The public and these
jail officers don't understand that&mdash;they invariably look upon
it as weakness or a confession of guilt. And I don't want them to
feel any such thing about you now, and especially when I know that
you're really not guilty. I know that now. I believe it. See! So
keep a stiff upper lip before Mason and everybody.</p>

<p>"In fact, from now on I want you to try and laugh a
little&mdash;or at any rate, smile and pass the time of day with
these fellows around here. There's an old saying in law, you know,
that the consciousness of innocence makes any man calm. Think and
look innocent. Don't sit and brood and look as though you had lost
your last friend, because you haven't. I'm here, and so is my
partner, Mr. Jephson. I'll bring him around here in a day or two,
and you're to look and act toward him exactly as you have toward
me. Trust him, because in legal matters he's even smarter than I am
in some ways. And to-morrow I'm going to bring you a couple of
books and some magazines and papers, and I want you to read them or
look at the pictures. They'll help keep your mind off your
troubles."</p>

<p>Clyde achieved a rather feeble smile and nodded his head.</p>

<p>"From now on, too,&mdash;I don't know whether you're at all
religious&mdash; but whether you are or not, they hold services
here in the jail on Sundays, and I want you to attend 'em
regularly&mdash;that is, if they ask you to. For this is a
religious community and I want you to make as good an impression as
you can. Never mind what people say or how they look&mdash;you do
as I tell you. And if this fellow Mason or any of those fellows
around here get to pestering you any more, send me a note.</p>

<p>"And now I'll be going, so give me a cheerful smile as I go
out&mdash; and another one as I come in. And don't talk, see?"</p>

<p>Then shaking Clyde briskly by the shoulders and slapping him on
the back, he strode out, actually thinking to himself: "But do I
really believe that this fellow is as innocent as he says? Would it
be possible for a fellow to strike a girl like that and not know
that he was doing it intentionally? And then swimming away
afterwards, because, as he says, if he went near her he thought he
might drown too. Bad. Bad! What twelve men are going to believe
that? And that bag, those two hats, that missing suit! And yet he
swears he didn't intentionally strike her. But what about all that
planning&mdash;the intent&mdash;which is just as bad in the eyes of
the law. Is he telling the truth or is he lying even
now&mdash;perhaps trying to deceive himself as well as me? And that
camera&mdash;we ought to get hold of that before Mason finds it and
introduces it. And that suit. I ought to find that and mention it,
maybe, so as to offset the look of its being hidden&mdash;say that
we had it all the time&mdash;send it to Lycurgus to be cleaned. But
no, no&mdash;wait a minute&mdash;I must think about that."</p>

<p>And so on, point by point, while deciding wearily that perhaps
it would be better not to attempt to use Clyde's story at all, but
rather to concoct some other story&mdash;this one changed or
modified in some way which would make it appear less cruel or
legally murderous.</p>

<h3>Chapter 15</h3>

<p>Mr. Reuben Jephson was decidedly different from Belknap,
Catchuman, Mason, Smillie&mdash;in fact any one, thus far, who had
seen Clyde or become legally interested in this case. He was young,
tall, thin, rugged, brown, cool but not cold spiritually, and with
a will and a determination of the tensile strength of steel. And
with a mental and legal equipment which for shrewdness and
self-interest was not unlike that of a lynx or a ferret. Those
shrewd, steel, very light blue eyes in his brown face. The force
and curiosity of the long nose. The strength of the hands and the
body. He had lost no time, as soon as he discovered there was a
possibility of their (Belknap &amp; Jephson) taking over the
defense of Clyde, in going over the minutes of the coroner's
inquest as well as the doctors' reports and the letters of Roberta
and Sondra. And now being faced by Belknap who was explaining that
Clyde did now actually admit to having plotted to kill Roberta,
although not having actually done so, since at the fatal moment,
some cataleptic state of mind or remorse had intervened and caused
him to unintentionally strike her&mdash;he merely stared without
the shadow of a smile or comment of any kind.</p>

<p>"But he wasn't in such a state when he went out there with her,
though?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Nor when he swam away afterwards?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Nor when he went through those woods, or changed to another
suit and hat, or hid that tripod?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Of course you know, constructively, in the eyes of the law, if
we use his own story, he's just as guilty as though he had struck
her, and the judge would have to so instruct."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know. I've thought of all that."</p>

<p>"Well, then&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, I'll tell you, Jephson, it's a tough case and no mistake.
It looks to me now as though Mason has all the cards. If we can get
this chap off, we can get anybody off. But as I see it, I'm not so
sure that we want to mention that cataleptic business yet&mdash; at
least not unless we want to enter a plea of insanity or emotional
insanity, or something like that&mdash;about like that Harry Thaw
case, for instance." He paused and scratched his slightly graying
temple dubiously.</p>

<p>"You think he's guilty, of course?" interpolated Jephson,
dryly.</p>

<p>"Well, now, as astonishing as it may seem to you, no. At least,
I'm not positive that I do. To tell you the truth, this is one of
the most puzzling cases I have ever run up against. This fellow is
by no means as hard as you think, or as cold&mdash;quite a simple,
affectionate chap, in a way, as you'll see for yourself&mdash;his
manner, I mean. He's only twenty-one or two. And for all his
connections with these Griffiths, he's very poor&mdash;just a
clerk, really. And he tells me that his parents are poor, too. They
run a mission of some kind out west&mdash;Denver, I
believe&mdash;and before that in Kansas City. He hasn't been home
in four years. In fact, he got into some crazy boy scrape out there
in Kansas City when he was working for one of the hotels as a
bell-boy, and had to run away. That's something we've got to look
out for in connection with Mason&mdash;whether he knows about that
or not. It seems he and a bunch of other bell-hops took some rich
fellow's car without his knowing it, and then because they were
afraid of being late, they ran over and killed a little girl. We've
got to find out about that and prepare for it, for if Mason does
know about it, he'll spring it at the trial, and just when he
thinks we're least expecting it."</p>

<p>"Well, he won't pull that one," replied Jephson, his hard,
electric, blue eyes gleaming, "not if I have to go to Kansas City
to find out."</p>

<p>And Belknap went on to tell Jephson all that he knew about
Clyde's life up to the present time&mdash;how he had worked at
dish-washing, waiting on table, soda-clerking, driving a wagon,
anything and everything, before he had arrived in
Lycurgus&mdash;how he had always been fascinated by girls&mdash;how
he had first met Roberta and later Sondra. Finally how he found
himself trapped by one and desperately in love with the other, whom
he could not have unless he got rid of the first one.</p>

<p>"And notwithstanding all that, you feel a doubt as to whether he
did kill her?" asked Jephson, at the conclusion of all this.</p>

<p>"Yes, as I say, I'm not at all sure that he did. But I do know
that he is still hipped over this second girl. His manner changed
whenever he or I happened to mention her. Once, for instance, I
asked him about his relations with her&mdash;and in spite of the
fact that he's accused of seducing and killing this other girl, he
looked at me as though I had said something I shouldn't have&mdash;
insulted him or her." And here Belknap smiled a wry smile, while
Jephson, his long, bony legs propped against the walnut desk before
him, merely stared at him.</p>

<p>"You don't say," he finally observed.</p>

<p>"And not only that," went on Belknap, "but he said, 'Why, no, of
course not. She wouldn't allow anything like that, and besides,'
and then he stopped. 'And besides what, Clyde,' I asked. 'Well, you
don't want to forget who she is.' 'Oh, I see,' I said. And then,
will you believe it, he wanted to know if there wasn't some way by
which her name and those letters she wrote him couldn't be kept out
of the papers and this case&mdash;her family prevented from knowing
so that she and they wouldn't be hurt too much."</p>

<p>"Not really? But what about the other girl?"</p>

<p>"That's just the point I'm trying to make. He could plot to kill
one girl and maybe even did kill her, for all I know, after
seducing her, but because he was being so sculled around by his
grand ideas of this other girl, he didn't quite know what he was
doing, really. Don't you see? You know how it is with some of these
young fellows of his age, and especially when they've never had
anything much to do with girls or money, and want to be something
grand."</p>

<p>"You think that made him a little crazy, maybe?" put in
Jephson.</p>

<p>"Well, it's possible&mdash;confused, hypnotized, loony&mdash;you
know&mdash;a brain storm as they say down in New York. But he
certainly is still cracked over that other girl. In fact, I think
most of his crying in jail is over her. He was crying, you know,
when I went in to see him, sobbing as if his heart would
break."</p>

<p>Meditatively Belknap scratched his right ear. "But just the
same, there certainly is something to this other idea&mdash;that
his mind was turned by all this&mdash;that Alden girl forcing him
on the one hand to marry her while the other girl was offering to
marry him. I know. I was once in such a scrape myself." And here he
paused to relate that to Jephson. "By the way," he went on, "he
says we can find that item about that other couple drowning in The
Times-Union of about June 18th or 19th."</p>

<p>"All right," replied Jephson, "I'll get it."</p>

<p>"What I want you to do to-morrow," continued Belknap, "is to go
over there with me and see what impression you get of him. I'll be
there to see if he tells it all to you in the same way. I want your
own individual viewpoint of him."</p>

<p>"You most certainly will get it," snapped Jephson.</p>

<p>Belknap and Jephson proceeded the next day to visit Clyde in
jail. And Jephson, after interviewing him and meditating once more
on his strange story, was even then not quite able to make up his
mind whether Clyde was as innocent of intending to strike Roberta
as he said, or not. For if he were, how could he have swum away
afterward, leaving her to drown? Decidedly it would be more
difficult for a jury than for himself, even, to be convinced.</p>

<p>At the same time, there was that contention of Belknap's as to
the possibility of Clyde's having been mentally upset or unbalanced
at the time that he accepted The Times-Union plot and proceeded to
act on it. That might be true, of course, yet personally, to
Jephson at least, Clyde appeared to be wise and sane enough now. As
Jephson saw him, he was harder and more cunning than Belknap was
willing to believe&mdash;a cunning, modified of course, by certain
soft and winning social graces for which one could hardly help
liking him. However, Clyde was by no means as willing to confide in
Jephson as he had been in Belknap&mdash;an attitude which did
little to attract Jephson to him at first. At the same time, there
was about Jephson a hard, integrated earnestness which soon
convinced Clyde of his technical, if not his emotional interest.
And after a while he began looking toward this younger man, even
more than toward Belknap as the one who might do most for him.</p>

<p>"Of course, you know that those letters which Miss Alden wrote
you are very strong?" began Jephson, after hearing Clyde restate
his story.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"They're very sad to any one who doesn't know all of the facts,
and on that account they are likely to prejudice any jury against
you, especially when they're put alongside Miss Finchley's
letters."</p>

<p>"Yes, I suppose they might," replied Clyde, "but then, she
wasn't always like that, either. It was only after she got in
trouble and I wanted her to let me go that she wrote like
that."</p>

<p>"I know. I know. And that's a point we want to think about and
maybe bring out, if we can. If only there were some way to keep
those letters out," he now turned to Belknap to say. Then, to
Clyde, "but what I want to ask you now is this&mdash;you were close
to her for something like a year, weren't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"In all of that time that you were with her, or before, was she
ever friendly, or maybe intimate, with any other young man
anywhere&mdash;that is, that you know of?"</p>

<p>As Clyde could see, Jephson was not afraid, or perhaps not
sufficiently sensitive, to refrain from presenting any thought or
trick that seemed to him likely to provide a loophole for escape.
But, far from being cheered by this suggestion, he was really
shocked. What a shameful thing in connection with Roberta and her
character it would be to attempt to introduce any such lie as this.
He could not and would not hint at any such falsehood, and so he
replied:</p>

<p>"No, sir. I never heard of her going with any one else. In fact,
I know she didn't."</p>

<p>"Very good! That settles that," snapped Jephson. "I judged from
her letters that what you say is true. At the same time, we must
know all the facts. It might make a very great difference if there
were some one else."</p>

<p>And at this point Clyde could not quite make sure whether he was
attempting to impress upon him the value of this as an idea or not,
but just the same he decided it was not right even to consider it.
And yet he was thinking: If only this man could think of a real
defense for me! He looks so shrewd.</p>

<p>"Well, then," went on Jephson, in the same hard, searching tone,
devoid, as Clyde saw it, of sentiment or pity of any kind, "here's
something else I want to ask you. In all the time that you knew
her, either before you were intimate with her or afterwards, did
she ever write you a mean or sarcastic or demanding or threatening
letter of any kind?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, I can't say that she ever did," replied Clyde, "in
fact, I know she didn't. No, sir. Except for those few last ones,
maybe&mdash;the very last one."</p>

<p>"And you never wrote her any, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, I never wrote her any letters."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Well, she was right there in the factory with me, you see.
Besides at the last there, after she went home, I was afraid
to."</p>

<p>"I see."</p>

<p>At the same time, as Clyde now proceeded to point out, and that
quite honestly, Roberta could be far from sweet-tempered at
times&mdash; could in fact be quite determined and even stubborn.
And she had paid no least attention to his plea that her forcing
him to marry her now would ruin him socially as well as in every
other way, and that even in the face of his willingness to work
along and pay for her support&mdash;an attitude which, as he now
described it, was what had caused all the trouble&mdash;whereas
Miss Finchley (and here he introduced an element of reverence and
enthusiasm which Jephson was quick to note) was willing to do
everything for him.</p>

<p>"So you really loved that Miss Finchley very much then, did
you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"And you couldn't care for Roberta any more after you met
her?"</p>

<p>"No, no. I just couldn't."</p>

<p>"I see," observed Jephson, solemnly nodding his head, and at the
same time meditating on how futile and dangerous, even, it might be
to let the jury know that. And then thinking that possibly it were
best to follow the previous suggestion of Belknap's, based on the
customary legal proceeding of the time, and claim insanity, or a
brain storm, brought about by the terrifying position in which he
imagined himself to be. But apart from that he now proceeded:</p>

<p>"You say something came over you when you were in the boat out
there with her on that last day&mdash;that you really didn't know
what you were doing at the time that you struck her?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, that's the truth." And here Clyde went on to explain
once more just what his state was at that time.</p>

<p>"All right, all right, I believe you," replied Jephson,
seemingly believing what Clyde said but not actually able to
conceive it at that. "But you know, of course, that no jury, in the
face of all these other circumstances, is going to believe that,"
he now announced. "There are too many things that'll have to be
explained and that we can't very well explain as things now stand.
I don't know about that idea." He now turned and was addressing
Belknap. "Those two hats, that bag&mdash;unless we're going to
plead insanity or something like that. I'm not so sure about all
this. Was there ever any insanity in your family that you know of?"
he now added, turning to Clyde once more.</p>

<p>"No, sir, not that I know of."</p>

<p>"No uncle or cousin or grandfather who had fits or strange ideas
or anything like that?"</p>

<p>"Not that I ever heard of, no, sir."</p>

<p>"And your rich relatives down there in Lycurgus&mdash;I suppose
they'd not like it very much if I were to step up and try to prove
anything like that?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid they wouldn't, no, sir," replied Clyde, thinking of
Gilbert.</p>

<p>"Well, let me see," went on Jephson after a time. "That makes it
rather hard. I don't see, though, that anything else would be as
safe." And here he turned once more to Belknap and began to inquire
as to what he thought of suicide as a theory, since Roberta's
letters themselves showed a melancholy trend which might easily
have led to thoughts of suicide. And could they not say that once
out on the lake with Clyde and pleading with him to marry her, and
he refusing to do so, she had jumped overboard. And he was too
astounded and mentally upset to try to save her.</p>

<p>"But what about his own story that the wind had blown his hat
off, and in trying to save that he upset the boat?" interjected
Belknap, and exactly as though Clyde were not present.</p>

<p>"Well, that's true enough, too, but couldn't we say that
perhaps, since he was morally responsible for her condition, which
in turn had caused her to take her life, he did not want to confess
to the truth of her suicide?"</p>

<p>At this Clyde winced, but neither now troubled to notice him.
They talked as though he was not present or could have no opinion
in the matter, a procedure which astonished but by no means moved
him to object, since he was feeling so helpless.</p>

<p>"But the false registrations! The two hats&mdash;the
suit&mdash;his bag!" insisted Belknap staccatically, a tone which
showed Clyde how serious Belknap considered his predicament to
be.</p>

<p>"Well, whatever theory we advance, those things will have to be
accounted for in some way," replied Jephson, dubiously. "We can't
admit the true story of his plotting without an insanity plea, not
as I see it&mdash;at any rate. And unless we use that, we've got
that evidence to deal with whatever we do." He threw up his hands
wearily and as if to say: I swear I don't know what to do about
this.</p>

<p>"But," persisted Belknap, "in the face of all that, and his
refusal to marry her, after his promises referred to in her
letters&mdash;why, it would only react against him, so that public
opinion would be more prejudiced against him than ever. No, that
won't do," he concluded. "We'll have to think of something which
will create some sort of sympathy for him."</p>

<p>And then once more turning to Clyde as though there had been no
such discussion. And looking at him as much as to say: "You are a
problem indeed." And then Jephson, observing: "And, oh, yes, that
suit you dropped in that lake up there near the Cranstons'&mdash;
describe the spot to me as near as you can where you threw
it&mdash;how far from the house was it?" He waited until Clyde
haltingly attempted to recapture the various details of the hour
and the scene as he could recall it.</p>

<p>"If I could go up there, I could find it quick enough."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know, but they won't let you go up there without Mason
being along," he returned. "And maybe not even then. You're in
prison now, and you can't be taken out without the state's consent,
you see. But we must get that suit." Then turning to Belknap and
lowering his voice, he added: "We want to get it and have it
cleaned and submit it as having been sent away to be cleaned by
him&mdash;not hidden, you see."</p>

<p>"Yes, that's so," commented Belknap idly while Clyde stood
listening curiously and a little amazed by this frank program of
trickery and deception on his behalf.</p>

<p>"And now in regard to that camera that fell in the lake&mdash;we
have to try and find that, too. I think maybe Mason may know about
it or suspect that it's there. At any rate it's very important that
we should find it before he does. You think that about where that
pole was that day you were up there is where the boat was when it
overturned?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, we must see if we can get that," he continued, turning to
Belknap. "We don't want that turning up in the trial, if we can
help it. For without that, they'll have to be swearing that he
struck her with that tripod or something that he didn't, and that's
where we may trip 'em up."</p>

<p>"Yes, that's true, too," replied Belknap.</p>

<p>"And now in regard to the bag that Mason has. That's another
thing I haven't seen yet, but I will see it to-morrow. Did you put
that suit, as wet as it was, in the bag when you came out of the
water?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, I wrung it out first. And then I dried it as much as I
could. And then I wrapped it up in the paper that we had the lunch
in and then put some dry pine needles underneath it in the bag and
on top of it"</p>

<p>"So there weren't any wet marks in the bag after you took it
out, as far as you know?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, I don't think so."</p>

<p>"But you're not sure?"</p>

<p>"Not exactly sure now that you ask me&mdash;no, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll see for myself to-morrow. And now as to those marks
on her face, you have never admitted to any one around here or
anywhere that you struck her in any way?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"And the mark on the top of her head was made by the boat, just
as you said?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"But the others you think you might have made with the
camera?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. I suppose they were."</p>

<p>"Well, then, this is the way it looks to me," said Jephson,
again turning to Belknap. "I think we can safely say when the time
comes that those marks were never made by him at all,
see?&mdash;but by the hooks and the poles with which they were
scraping around up there when they were trying to find her. We can
try it, anyhow. And if the hooks and poles didn't do it," he added,
a little grimly and dryly, "certainly hauling her body from that
lake to that railroad station and from there to here on the train
might have."</p>

<p>"Yes, I think Mason would have a hard time proving that they
weren't made that way," replied Belknap.</p>

<p>"And as for that tripod, well, we'd better exhume the body and
make our own measurements, and measure the thickness of the edge of
that boat, so that it may not be so easy for Mason to make any use
of the tripod now that he has it, after all."</p>

<p>Mr. Jephson's eyes were very small and very clear and very blue,
as he said this. His head, as well as his body, had a thin, ferrety
look. And it seemed to Clyde, who had been observing and listening
to all this with awe, that this younger man might be the one to aid
him. He was so shrewd and practical, so very direct and chill and
indifferent and yet confidence-inspiring, quite like an
uncontrollable machine of a kind which generates power.</p>

<p>And when at last these two were ready to go, he was sorry. For
with them near him, planning and plotting in regard to himself, he
felt so much safer, stronger, more hopeful, more certain of being
free, maybe, at some future date.</p>

<h3>Chapter 16</h3>

<p>The result of all this, however, was that it was finally decided
that perhaps the easiest and safest defense that could be made,
assuming that the Griffiths family of Lycurgus would submit to it,
would be that of insanity or "brain storm"&mdash;a temporary
aberration due to love and an illusion of grandeur aroused in Clyde
by Sondra Finchley and the threatened disruption by Roberta of all
his dreams and plans. But after consultation with Catchuman and
Darrah Brookhart at Lycurgus, and these in turn conferring with
Samuel and Gilbert Griffiths, it was determined that this would not
do. For to establish insanity or "brain storm" would require
previous evidence or testimony to the effect that Clyde was of none
too sound mind, erratic his whole life long, and with certain
specific instances tending to demonstrate how really peculiar he
was&mdash; relatives (among them the Griffiths of Lycurgus
themselves, perhaps), coming on to swear to it&mdash;a line of
evidence, which, requiring as it would, outright lying and perjury
on the part of many as well as reflecting on the Griffiths' blood
and brain, was sufficient to alienate both Samuel and Gilbert to
the extent that they would have none of it. And so Brookhart was
compelled to assure Belknap that this line of defense would have to
be abandoned.</p>

<p>Such being the case, both Belknap and Jephson were once more
compelled to sit down and consider. For any other defense which
either could think of now seemed positively hopeless.</p>

<p>"I want to tell you one thing!" observed the sturdy Jephson,
after thumbing through the letters of both Roberta and Sondra
again. "These letters of this Alden girl are the toughest things
we're going to have to face. They're likely to make any jury cry if
they're read right, and then to introduce those letters from that
other girl on top of these would be fatal. It will be better, I
think, if we do not mention hers at all, unless he does. It will
only make it look as though he had killed that Alden girl to get
rid of her. Mason couldn't want anything better, as I see it." And
with this Belknap agreed most heartily.</p>

<p>At the same time, some plan must be devised immediately. And so,
out of these various conferences, it was finally deduced by
Jephson, who saw a great opportunity for himself in this matter,
that the safest possible defense that could be made, and one to
which Clyde's own suspicious and most peculiar actions would most
exactly fit, would be that he had never contemplated murder. On the
contrary, being a moral if not a physical coward, as his own story
seemed to suggest, and in terror of being exposed and driven out of
Lycurgus and of the heart of Sondra, and never as yet having told
Roberta of Sondra and thinking that knowledge of this great love
for her (Sondra) might influence Roberta to wish to be rid of him,
he had hastily and without any worse plan in mind, decided to
persuade Roberta to accompany him to any near-by resort but not
especially Grass Lake or Big Bittern, in order to tell her all this
and so win his freedom&mdash;yet not without offering to pay her
expenses as nearly as he could during her very trying period.</p>

<p>"All well and good," commented Belknap. "But that involves his
refusing to marry her, doesn't it? And what jury is going to
sympathize with him for that or believe that he didn't want to kill
her?"</p>

<p>"Wait a minute, wait a minute," replied Jephson, a little
testily. "So far it does. Sure. But you haven't heard me to the end
yet. I said I had a plan."</p>

<p>"All right, then what is it?" replied Belknap most
interested.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll tell you&mdash;my plan's this&mdash;to leave all the
facts just as they are, and just as he tells them, and just as
Mason has discussed them so far, except, of course, his striking
her&mdash;and then explain them&mdash;the letters, the wounds, the
bag, the two hats, everything&mdash;not deny them in any way."</p>

<p>And here he paused and ran his long, thin, freckled hands
eagerly through his light hair and looked across the grass of the
public square to the jail where Clyde was, then toward Belknap
again.</p>

<p>"All very good, but how?" queried Belknap.</p>

<p>"There's no other way, I tell you," went on Jephson quite to
himself, and ignoring his senior, "and I think this will do it." He
turned to look out the window again, and began as though talking to
some one outside: "He goes up there, you see, because he's
frightened and because he has to do something or be exposed. And he
signs those registers just as he did because he's afraid to have it
known by anybody down there in Lycurgus that he is up there. And he
has this plan about confessing to her about this other girl.
<i>but</i>," and now he paused and looked fixedly at Belknap, "and
this is the keystone of the whole thing&mdash;if this won't hold
water, then down we go! Listen! He goes up there with her,
frightened, and not to marry her or to kill her but to argue with
her to go away. But once up there and he sees how sick she is, and
tired, and sad&mdash; well, you know how much she still loves him,
and he spends two nights with her, see?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I see," interrupted Belknap, curiously, but not quite so
dubiously now. "And that might explain those nights."</p>

<p>"<i>Might</i>? Would!" replied Jephson, slyly and calmly, his
harebell eyes showing only cold, eager, practical logic, no trace
of emotion or even sympathy of any kind, really. "Well, while he's
up there with her under those conditions&mdash;so close to her
again, you see" (and his facial expression never altered so much as
by a line) "he experiences a change of heart. You get me? He's
sorry for her. He's ashamed of himself&mdash;his sin against her.
That ought to appeal to these fellows around here, these religious
and moral people, oughtn't it?"</p>

<p>"It might," quietly interpolated Belknap, who by now was very
much interested and a little hopeful.</p>

<p>"He sees that he's done her a wrong," continued Jephson, intent,
like a spider spinning a web, on his own plan, "and in spite of all
his affection for this other girl, he's now ready to do the right
thing by this Alden girl, do you see, because he's sorry and
ashamed of himself. That takes the black look off his plotting to
kill her while spending those two nights in Utica and Grass Lake
with her."</p>

<p>"He still loves the other girl, though?" interjected
Belknap.</p>

<p>"Well, sure. He likes her at any rate, has been fascinated by
that life down there and sort of taken out of himself, made over
into a different person, but now he's ready to marry Roberta, in
case, after telling her all about this other girl and his love for
her, she still wants him to."</p>

<p>"I see. But how about the boat now and that bag and his going up
to this Finchley girl's place afterwards?"</p>

<p>"Just a minute! Just a minute! I'll tell you about that,"
continued Jephson, his blue eyes boring into space like a powerful
electric ray. "Of course, he goes out in the boat with her, and of
course he takes that bag, and of course he signs those registers
falsely, and walks away through those woods to that other girl,
after Roberta is drowned. But why? Why? Do you want to know why?
I'll tell you! He felt sorry for her, see, and he wanted to marry
her, or at least he wanted to do the right thing by her at the very
last there. Not before, not before, remember, but <i>after</i> he
had spent a night with her in Utica and another one in Grass Lake.
But once she was drowned&mdash;and accidentally, of course, as he
says, there was his love for that other girl. He hadn't ceased
loving her even though he was willing to sacrifice her in order to
do the right thing by Roberta. See?"</p>

<p>"I see."</p>

<p>"And how are they going to prove that he didn't experience a
change of heart if he says he did and sticks to it?"</p>

<p>"I see, but he'll have to tell a mighty convincing story," added
Belknap, a little heavily. "And how about those two hats? They're
going to have to be explained."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm coming to those now. The one he had was a little
soiled. And so he decided to buy another. As for that story he told
Mason about wearing a cap, well, he was frightened and lied because
he thought he would have to get out of it. Now, of course, before
he goes to that other girl afterwards&mdash;while Roberta is still
alive, I mean, there's his relationship with the other girl, what
he intends to do about her. He's talking to Roberta, now you see,"
he continued, "and that has to be disposed of in some way. But, as
I see it, that's easy, for of course after he experiences a change
of heart and wants to do the right thing by Roberta, all he has to
do is to write that other girl or go to her and tell her&mdash;
about the wrong he has done Roberta."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"For, as I see it now, she can't be kept out of the case
entirely, after all. We'll have to ring her in, I'm afraid."</p>

<p>"All right; then we have to," said Belknap.</p>

<p>"Because you see, if Roberta still feels that he ought to marry
her&mdash;he'll go first and tell that Finchley girl that he can't
marry her&mdash;that he's going away&mdash;that is, if Roberta
doesn't object to his leaving her that long, don't you see?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"If she does, he'll marry her, either at Three Mile Bay or some
other place."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"But you don't want to forget that while she's still alive he's
puzzled and distressed. And it's only after that second night, at
Grass Lake, that he begins to see how wrong all his actions have
been, you understand. Something happens. Maybe she cries or talks
about wanting to die, like she does in those letters."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And so he wants a quiet place where they can sit down in peace
and talk, where no one else will see or hear them."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes&mdash;go on."</p>

<p>"Well, he thinks of Big Bittern. He's been up there once before
or they're near there, then, and just below there, twelve miles, is
Three Mile Bay, where, if they decide to marry, they can."</p>

<p>"I see."</p>

<p>"If not, if she doesn't want to marry him after his full
confession, he can row her back to the inn, can't he, and he or she
can stay there or go on."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes."</p>

<p>"In the meantime, not to have any delay or be compelled to hang
about that inn&mdash;it's rather expensive, you know, and he hasn't
any too much money&mdash;he takes that lunch in his bag. Also his
camera, because he wants to take some pictures. For if Mason should
turn up with that camera, it's got to be explained, and it will be
better explained by us than it will be by him, won't it?"</p>

<p>"I see, I see," exclaimed Belknap, intensely interested by now
and actually smiling and beginning to rub his hands.</p>

<p>"So they go out on the lake."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And they row around."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And finally after lunch on shore, some pictures
taken&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"He decides to tell her just how things stand with him. He's
ready, willing&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I get you."</p>

<p>"Only just before doing that, he wants to take one or two more
pictures of her there in the boat, just off shore."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And then he'll tell her, see?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And so they go out in the boat again for a little row, just as
he did, see?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"But because they intend to go ashore again for some flowers,
he's left the bag there, see? That explains the bag."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"But before taking any more pictures there, in the boat on the
water, he begins to tell her about his love for this other
girl&mdash; that if she wants him to, now he'll marry her and then
write this Sondra a letter. Or, if she feels she doesn't want to
marry him with him loving this other girl..."</p>

<p>"Yes, go on!" interrupted Belknap, eagerly.</p>

<p>"Well," continued Jephson, "he'll do his best to take care of
her and support her out of the money he'll have after he marries
the rich girl."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well, she wants him to marry her and drop this Miss
Finchley!"</p>

<p>"I see."</p>

<p>"And he agrees?"</p>

<p>"Sure."</p>

<p>"Also she's so grateful that in her excitement, or gratitude,
she jumps up to come toward him, you see?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And the boat rocks a little, and he jumps up to help her
because he's afraid she's going to fall, see?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I see."</p>

<p>"Well, now if we wanted to we could have him have that camera of
his in his hand or not, just as you think fit."</p>

<p>"Yes, I see what you're driving at."</p>

<p>"Well, whether he keeps it in his hand or doesn't, there's some
misstep on his part or hers, just as he says, or just the motion of
the two bodies, causes the boat to go over, and he strikes her, or
not, just as you think fit, but accidentally, of course."</p>

<p>"Yes, I see, and I'll be damned!" exclaimed Belknap. "Fine,
Reuben! Excellent! Wonderful, really!"</p>

<p>"And the boat strikes her too, as well as him, a little, see?"
went on Jephson, paying no attention to this outburst, so
interested was he in his own plot, "and makes him a little dizzy,
too."</p>

<p>"I see."</p>

<p>"And he hears her cries and sees her, but he's a little stunned
himself, see? And by the time he's ready to do
something&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She's gone," concluded Belknap, quietly. "Drowned. I get
you."</p>

<p>"And then, because of all those other suspicious circumstances
and false registrations&mdash;and because now she's gone and he
can't do anything more for her, anyhow&mdash;her relatives might
not want to know her condition, you know&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I see."</p>

<p>"He slips away, frightened, a moral coward, just as we'll have
to contend from the first, anxious to stand well with his uncle and
not lose his place in this world. Doesn't that explain it?"</p>

<p>"About as well as anything could explain it, Reuben, I think. In
fact, I think it's a plausible explanation and I congratulate you.
I don't see how any one could hope to find a better. If that
doesn't get him off, or bring about a disagreement, at least we
might get him off with, well, say, twenty years, don't you think?"
And very much cheered, he got up, and after eyeing his long, thin
associate admiringly, added: "Fine!" while Jephson, his blue eyes
for all the world like windless, still pools, looked steadily
back.</p>

<p>"But of course you know what that means?" Jephson now added,
calmly and softly.</p>

<p>"That we have to put him on the witness stand? Surely, surely. I
see that well enough. But it's his only chance."</p>

<p>"And he won't strike people as a very steady or convincing
fellow, I'm afraid&mdash;too nervous and emotional."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know all that," replied Belknap, quickly. "He's easily
rattled. And Mason will go after him like a wild bull. But we'll
have to coach him as to all this&mdash;drill him. Make him
understand that it's his only chance&mdash;that his very life
depends on it. Drill him for months."</p>

<p>"If he fails, then he's gone. If only we could do something to
give him courage&mdash;teach him to act it out." Jephson's eyes
seemed to be gazing directly before him at the very courtroom scene
in which Clyde on the stand would have Mason before him. And then
picking up Roberta's letters (copies of them furnished by Mason)
and looking at them, he concluded: "If it only weren't for
these&mdash; here." He weighed them up and down in his hand.
"Christ!" he finally concluded, darkly. "What a case! But we're not
licked yet, not by a darn sight! Why, we haven't begun to fight
yet. And we'll get a lot of publicity, anyhow. By the way," he
added, "I'm having a fellow I know down near Big Bittern dredge for
that camera to-night. Wish me luck."</p>

<p>"Do I?" was all Belknap replied.</p>

<h3>Chapter 17</h3>

<p>The struggle and excitement of a great murder trial! Belknap and
Jephson, after consulting with Brookhart and Catchuman, learning
that they considered Jephson's plan "perhaps the only way," but
with as little reference to the Griffiths as possible.</p>

<p>And then at once, Messrs. Belknap and Jephson issuing
preliminary statements framed in such a manner as to show their
faith in Clyde, presenting him as being, in reality, a much
maligned and entirely misunderstood youth, whose intentions and
actions toward Miss Alden were as different from those set forth by
Mason as white from black. And intimating that the undue haste of
the district attorney in seeking a special term of the Supreme
Court might possibly have a political rather than a purely legal
meaning. Else why the hurry, especially in the face of an
approaching county election? Could there be any plan to use the
results of such a trial as this to further any particular person's,
or group of persons', political ambitions? Messrs. Belknap and
Jephson begged to hope not.</p>

<p>But regardless of such plans or the prejudices or the political
aspirations of any particular person or group, the defense in this
instance did not propose to permit a boy as innocent as Clyde,
trapped by circumstances&mdash;as counsel for the defense would be
prepared to show&mdash;to be railroaded to the electric chair
merely to achieve a victory for the Republican party in November.
Furthermore, to combat these strange and yet false circumstances,
the defense would require a considerable period of time to prepare
its case. Therefore, it would be necessary for them to file a
formal protest at Albany against the district attorney's request to
the governor for a special term of the Supreme Court. There was no
need for the same, since the regular term for the trial of such
cases would fall in January, and the preparation of their case
would require that much time.</p>

<p>But while this strong, if rather belated, reply was listened to
with proper gravity by the representatives of the various
newspapers, Mason vigorously pooh-poohed this "windy" assertion of
political plotting, as well as the talk of Clyde's innocence. "What
reason have I, a representative of all the people of this county,
to railroad this man anywhere or make one single charge against him
unless the charges make themselves? Doesn't the evidence itself
show that he did kill this girl? And has he ever said or done one
thing to clear up any of the suspicious circumstances? No! Silence
or lies. And until these circumstances are disproved by these very
able gentlemen, I am going right ahead. I have all the evidence
necessary to convict this young criminal now. And to delay it until
January, when I shall be out of office, as they know, and when a
new man will have to go over all this evidence with which I have
familiarized myself, is to entail great expense to the county. For
all the witnesses I have gotten together are right here now, easy
to bring into Bridgeburg without any great expense to the county.
But where will they be next January or February, especially after
the defense has done its best to scatter them? No, sir! I will not
agree to it. But, if within ten days or two weeks from now even,
they can bring me something that will so much as make it look as
though even some of the charges I have made are not true, I'll be
perfectly willing to go before the presiding judge with them, and
if they can show him any evidence they have or hope to have, or
that there are any distant known witnesses to be secured who can
help prove this fellow's innocence, why, then, well and good. I'll
be willing to ask the judge to grant them as much time as he may
see fit, even if it throws the trial over until I am out of office.
But if the trial comes up while I'm here, as I honestly hope it
will, I'll prosecute it to the best of my ability, not because I'm
looking for an office of any kind but because I am now the district
attorney and it is my duty to do so. And as for my being in
politics, well, Mr. Belknap is in politics, isn't he? He ran
against me the last time, and I hear he desires to run again."</p>

<p>Accordingly he proceeded to Albany further to impress upon the
Governor the very great need of an immediate special term of the
Court so that Clyde might be indicted. And the Governor, hearing
the personal arguments of both Mason and Belknap, decided in favor
of Mason, on the ground that the granting of a special term did not
militate against any necessary delay of the trial of the case,
since nothing which the defense as yet had to offer seemed to
indicate that the calling of a special term was likely in any way
to prevent it from obtaining as much time wherein to try the case
as needed. Besides, it would be the business of the Supreme Court
justice appointed to consider such arguments&mdash;not himself. And
accordingly, a special term of the Supreme Court was ordered, with
one Justice Frederick Oberwaltzer of the eleventh judicial district
designated to preside. And when Mason appeared before him with the
request that he fix the date of the Special Grand Jury by which
Clyde might be indicted, this was set for August fifth.</p>

<p>And then that body sitting, it was no least trouble for Mason to
have Clyde indicted.</p>

<p>And thereafter the best that Belknap and Jephson could do was to
appear before Oberwaltzer, a Democrat, who owed his appointment to
a previous governor, to argue for a change of venue, on the ground
that by no possible stretch of the imagination could any twelve men
residing in Cataraqui County be found who, owing to the public and
private statements of Mason, were not already vitally opposed to
Clyde and so convinced of his guilt that before ever such a jury
could be addressed by a defense, he would be convicted.</p>

<p>"But where are you going then?" inquired Justice Oberwaltzer,
who was impartial enough. "The same material has been published
everywhere."</p>

<p>"But, your Honor, this crime which the district attorney here
has been so busy in magnifying&mdash;" (a long and heated objection
on the part of Mason).</p>

<p>"But we contend just the same," continued Belknap, "that the
public has been unduly stirred and deluded. You can't get twelve
men now who will try this man fairly."</p>

<p>"What nonsense!" exclaimed Mason, angrily. "Mere twaddle! Why,
the newspapers themselves have gathered and published more evidence
than I have. It's the publicly discovered facts in this case that
have aroused prejudice, if any has been aroused. But no more than
would be aroused anywhere, I maintain. Besides, if this case is to
be transferred to a distant county when the majority of the
witnesses are right here, this county is going to be saddled with
an enormous expense, which it cannot afford and which the facts do
not warrant."</p>

<p>Justice Oberwaltzer, who was of a sober and moral turn, a slow
and meticulous man inclined to favor conservative procedure in all
things, was inclined to agree. And after five days, in which he did
not more than muse idly upon the matter, he decided to deny the
motion. If he were wrong, there was the Appellate Division to which
the defense could resort. As for stays, having fixed the date of
the trial for October fifteenth (ample time, as he judged, for the
defense to prepare its case), he adjourned for the remainder of the
summer to his cottage on Blue Mountain Lake, where both the
prosecution and the defense, should any knotty or locally insoluble
legal complication arise, would be able to find him and have his
personal attention.</p>

<p>But with the entry of the Messrs. Belknap and Jephson into the
case, Mason found it advisable to redouble his efforts to make
positive, in so far as it were possible, the conviction of Clyde.
He feared the young Jephson as much as he did Belknap. And for that
reason, taking with him Burton Burleigh and Earl Newcomb, he now
revisited Lycurgus, where among other things he was able to
discover (1) where Clyde had purchased the camera; (2) that three
days before his departure for Big Bittern he had said to Mrs.
Peyton that he was thinking of taking his camera with him and that
he must get some films for it; (3) that there was a haberdasher by
the name of Orrin Short who had known Clyde well and that but four
months before Clyde had applied to him for advice in connection
with a factory hand's pregnant wife&mdash;also (and this in great
confidence to Burton Burleigh, who had unearthed him) that he had
recommended to Clyde a certain Dr. Glenn, near Gloversville; (4)
Dr. Glenn himself being sought and pictures of Clyde and Roberta
being submitted, he was able to identify Roberta, although not
Clyde, and to describe the state of mind in which she had
approached him, as well as the story she had told&mdash;a story
which in no way incriminated Clyde or herself, and which,
therefore, Mason decided might best be ignored, for the present,
anyhow.</p>

<p>And (5), via these same enthusiastic efforts, there rose to the
surface the particular hat salesman in Utica who had sold Clyde the
hat. For Burton Burleigh being interviewed while in Utica, and his
picture published along with one of Clyde, this salesman chanced to
see it and recalling him at once made haste to communicate with
Mason, with the result that his testimony, properly typewritten and
sworn to, was carried away by Mason.</p>

<p>And, in addition, the country girl who had been on the steamer
"Cygnus" and who had noticed Clyde, wrote Mason that she remembered
him wearing a straw hat, also his leaving the boat at Sharon, a bit
of evidence which most fully confirmed that of the captain of the
boat and caused Mason to feel that Providence or Fate was working
with him. And last, but most important of all to him, there came a
communication from a woman residing in Bedford, Pennsylvania, who
announced that during the week of July third to tenth, she and her
husband had been camping on the east shore of Big Bittern, near the
southern end of the lake. And while rowing on the lake on the
afternoon of July eighth, at about six o'clock, she had heard a cry
which sounded like that of a woman or girl in distress&mdash;a
plaintive, mournful cry. It was very faint and had seemed to come
from beyond the island which was to the south and west of the bay
in which they were fishing.</p>

<p>Mason now proposed to remain absolutely silent regarding this
information, and that about the camera and films and the data
regarding Clyde's offense in Kansas City, until nearer the day of
trial, or during the trial itself, when it would be impossible for
the defense to attempt either to refute or ameliorate it in any
way.</p>

<p>As for Belknap and Jephson, apart from drilling Clyde in the
matter of his general denial based on his change of heart once he
had arrived at Grass Lake, and the explanation of the two hats and
the bag, they could not see that there was much to do. True, there
was the suit thrown in Fourth Lake near the Cranstons', but after
much trolling on the part of a seemingly casual fisherman, that was
brought up, cleaned and pressed, and now hung in a locked closet in
the Belknap and Jephson office. Also, there was the camera at Big
Bittern, dived for but never found by them&mdash;a circumstance
which led Jephson to conclude that Mason must have it, and so
caused him to decide that he would refer to it at the earliest
possible opportunity at the trial. But as for Clyde striking her
with it, even accidentally, well, it was decided at that time at
least, to contend that he had not&mdash;although after exhuming
Roberta's body at Biltz it had been found that the marks on her
face, even at this date, did correspond in some degree to the size
and shape of the camera.</p>

<p>For, in the first place, they were exceedingly dubious of Clyde
as a witness. Would he or would he not, in telling of how it all
happened, be sufficiently direct or forceful and sincere to
convince any jury that he had so struck her without intending to
strike her? For on that, marks or no marks, would depend whether
the jury was going to believe him. And if it did not believe that
he struck her accidentally, then a verdict of guilty, of
course.</p>

<p>And so they prepared to await the coming of the trial, only
working betimes and in so far as they dared, to obtain testimony or
evidence as to Clyde's previous good character, but being blocked
to a degree by the fact that in Lycurgus, while pretending to be a
model youth outwardly, he had privately been conducting himself
otherwise, and that in Kansas City his first commercial efforts had
resulted in such a scandal.</p>

<p>However, one of the most difficult matters in connection with
Clyde and his incarceration here, as Belknap and Jephson as well as
the prosecution saw it, was the fact that thus far not one single
member of his own or his uncle's family had come forward to
champion him. And to no one save Belknap and Jephson had he
admitted where his parents were. Yet would it not be necessary, as
both Belknap and Jephson argued from time to time, if any case at
all were to be made out for him, to have his mother or father, or
at least a sister or a brother, come forward to say a good word for
him? Otherwise, Clyde might appear to be a pariah, one who had been
from the first a drifter and a waster and was now purposely being
avoided by all who knew him.</p>

<p>For this reason, at their conference with Darrah Brookhart they
had inquired after Clyde's parents and had learned that in so far
as the Griffiths of Lycurgus were concerned, there lay a deep
objection to bringing on any member of this western branch of the
family. There was, as he explained, a great social gap between
them, which it would not please the Lycurgus Griffiths to have
exploited here. Besides, who could say but that once Clyde's
parents were notified or discovered by the yellow press, they might
not lend themselves to exploitation. Both Samuel and Gilbert
Griffiths, as Brookhart now informed Belknap, had suggested that it
was best, if Clyde did not object, to keeping his immediate
relatives in the background. In fact, on this, in some measure at
least, was likely to depend the extent of their financial aid to
Clyde.</p>

<p>Clyde was in accord with this wish of the Griffiths, although no
one who talked with him sufficiently or heard him express how sorry
he was on his mother's account that all this had happened, could
doubt the quality of the blood and emotional tie that held him and
his mother together. The complete truth was that his present
attitude toward her was a mixture of fear and shame because of the
manner in which she was likely to view his predicament&mdash;his
moral if not his social failure. Would she be willing to believe
the story prepared by Belknap and Jephson as to his change of
heart? But even apart from that, to have her come here now and look
at him through these bars when he was so disgraced&mdash;to be
compelled to face her and talk to her day after day! Her clear,
inquiring, tortured eyes! Her doubt as to his innocence, since he
could feel that even Belknap and Jephson, in spite of all their
plans for him, were still a little dubious as to that unintentional
blow of his. They did not really believe it, and they might tell
her that. And would his religious, God-fearing, crime-abhorring
mother be more credulous than they?</p>

<p>Being asked again what he thought ought to be done about his
parents, he replied that he did not believe he could face his
mother yet&mdash;it would do no good and would only torture
both.</p>

<p>And fortunately, as he saw it, apparently no word of all that
had befallen him had yet reached his parents in Denver. Because of
their peculiar religious and moral beliefs, all copies of worldly
and degenerate daily papers were consistently excluded from their
home and Mission. And the Lycurgus Griffiths had had no desire to
inform them.</p>

<p>Yet one night, at about the time that Belknap and Jephson were
most seriously debating the absence of his parents and what, if
anything, should be done about it, Esta, who some time after Clyde
had arrived in Lycurgus had married and was living in the southeast
portion of Denver, chanced to read in The Rocky Mountain
News&mdash;and this just subsequent to Clyde's indictment by the
Grand Jury at Bridgeburg:</p>

<blockquote>"BOY SLAYER OF WORKING GIRL INDICTED<br>
<br>
"Bridgeburg, N. Y., Aug. 6: A special Grand Jury appointed by
Governor Stouderback, of this state, to sit in the case of Clyde
Griffiths, the nephew of the wealthy collar manufacturer of the
same name, of Lycurgus, New York, recently charged with the killing
of Miss Roberta Alden, of Biltz, New York, at Big Bittern Lake in
the Adirondacks on July 8th last, to-day returned an indictment
charging murder in the first degree.<br>
<br>
"Subsequent to the indictment, Griffiths, who in spite of almost
overwhelming evidence, has persisted in asserting that the alleged
crime was an accident, and who, accompanied by his counsel, Alvin
Belknap, and Reuben Jephson, of this city, was arraigned before
Supreme Court Justice Oberwaltzer, pleaded not guilty. He was
remanded for trial, which was set for October 15th.<br>
<br>
"Young Griffiths, who is only twenty-two years of age, and up to
the day of his arrest a respected member of Lycurgus smart society,
is alleged to have stunned and then drowned his working-girl
sweetheart, whom he had wronged and then planned to desert in favor
of a richer girl. The lawyers in this case have been retained by
his wealthy uncle of Lycurgus, who has hitherto remained aloof. But
apart from this, it is locally asserted, no relative has come
forward to aid in his defense."</blockquote>

<p>Esta forthwith made a hurried departure for her mother's home.
Despite the directness and clarity of this she was not willing to
believe it was Clyde. Still there was the damning force of
geography and names&mdash;the rich Lycurgus Griffiths, the absence
of his own relatives.</p>

<p>As quickly as the local street car would carry her, she now
presented herself at the combined lodging house and mission known
as the "Star of Hope," in Bildwell Street, which was scarcely
better than that formerly maintained in Kansas City. For while it
provided a number of rooms for wayfarers at twenty-five cents a
night, and was supposed to be self-supporting, it entailed much
work with hardly any more profit. Besides, by now, both Frank and
Julia, who long before this had become irked by the drab world in
which they found themselves, had earnestly sought to free
themselves of it, leaving the burden of the mission work on their
father and mother. Julia, now nineteen, was cashiering for a local
downtown restaurant, and Frank, nearing seventeen, had but recently
found work in a fruit and vegetable commission house. In fact, the
only child about the place by day was little Russell, the
illegitimate son of Esta&mdash;now between three and four years of
age, and most reservedly fictionalized by his grandparents as an
orphan whom they had adopted in Kansas City. He was a dark-haired
child, in some ways resembling Clyde, who, even at this early age,
as Clyde had been before him, was being instructed in those
fundamental verities which had irritated Clyde in his own
childhood.</p>

<p>At the time that Esta, now a decidedly subdued and reserved
wife, entered, Mrs. Griffiths was busy sweeping and dusting and
making up beds. But on sight of her daughter at this unusual hour
approaching, and with blanched cheeks signaling her to come inside
the door of a vacant room, Mrs. Griffiths, who, because of years of
difficulties of various kinds, was more or less accustomed to
scenes such as this, now paused in wonder, the swiftly beclouding
mist of apprehension shining in her eyes. What new misery or ill
was this? For decidedly Esta's weak gray eyes and manner indicated
distress. And in her hand was folded a paper, which she opened and
after giving her mother a most solicitous look, pointed to the
item, toward which Mrs. Griffiths now directed her look. But what
was this?</p>

<blockquote>"Boy slayer of working-girl sweetheart indicted."<br>
<br>
"Charged with the killing of Miss Roberta Alden at Big Bittern Lake
in the Adirondacks on July 8 last."<br>
<br>
"Returned indictment charging murder in the first degree."<br>
<br>
"In spite of almost overwhelming circumstantial evidence."<br>
<br>
"Pleaded not guilty."<br>
<br>
"Remanded for trial."<br>
<br>
"Set for October 15."<br>
<br>
"Stunned and drowned his working-girl sweetheart."<br>
<br>
"No relative has come forward."</blockquote>

<p>It was thus that her eye and her mind automatically selected the
most essential lines. And then as swiftly going over them
again.</p>

<blockquote>"Clyde Griffiths, nephew of the wealthy collar
manufacturer of Lycurgus, New York."</blockquote>

<p>Clyde&mdash;her son! And only recently&mdash;but no, over a
month ago&mdash;(and they had been worrying a little as to that,
she and Asa, because he had not&mdash;) July 8th! And it was now
August 11th! Then&mdash;yes! But not her son! Impossible! Clyde the
murderer of a girl who was his sweetheart! But he was not like
that! He had written to her how he was getting along&mdash;the head
of a large department, with a future. But of no girl. But now! And
yet that other little girl there in Kansas City. Merciful God! And
the Griffiths, of Lycurgus, her husband's brother, knowing of this
and not writing! Ashamed, disgusted, no doubt. Indifferent. But no,
he had hired two lawyers. Yet the horror! Asa! Her other children!
What the papers would say! This mission! They would have to give it
up and go somewhere else again. Yet was he guilty or not guilty?
She must know that before judging or thinking. This paper said he
had pleaded not guilty. Oh, that wretched, worldly, showy hotel in
Kansas City! Those other bad boys! Those two years in which he
wandered here and there, not writing, passing as Harry Tenet. Doing
what? Learning what?</p>

<p>She paused, full of that intense misery and terror which no
faith in the revealed and comforting verities of God and mercy and
salvation which she was always proclaiming, could for the moment
fend against. Her boy! Her Clyde! In jail, accused of murder! She
must wire! She must write! She must go, maybe. But how to get the
money! What to do when she got there. How to get the
courage&mdash;the faith&mdash;to endure it. Yet again, neither Asa
nor Frank nor Julia must know. Asa, with his protesting and yet
somehow careworn faith, his weak eyes and weakening body. And must
Frank and Julia, now just starting out in life, be saddled with
this? Marked thus?</p>

<p>Merciful God! Would her troubles never end?</p>

<p>She turned, her big, work-worn hands trembling slightly, shaking
the paper she held, while Esta, who sympathized greatly with her
mother these days because of all she had been compelled to endure,
stood by. She looked so tired at times, and now to be racked by
this! Yet, as she knew, her mother was the strongest in the
family&mdash;so erect, so square-shouldered, defiant&mdash;a
veritable soul pilot in her cross-grained, uniformed way.</p>

<p>"Mamma, I just can't believe it can be Clyde," was all Esta
could say now. "It just can't be, can it?"</p>

<p>But Mrs. Griffiths merely continued to stare at that ominous
headline, then swiftly ran her gray-blue eyes over the room. Her
broad face was blanched and dignified by an enormous strain and an
enormous pain. Her erring, misguided, no doubt unfortunate, son,
with all his wild dreams of getting on and up, was in danger of
death, of being electrocuted for a crime&mdash;for murder! He had
killed some one&mdash;a poor working-girl, the paper said.</p>

<p>"Ssh!" she whispered, putting one finger to her own lips as a
sign. "He" (indicating Asa) "must not know yet, anyhow. We must
wire first, or write. You can have the answers come to you, maybe.
I will give you the money. But I must sit down somewhere now for a
minute. I feel a little weak. I'll sit here. Let me have the
Bible."</p>

<p>On the small dresser was a Gideon Bible, which, sitting on the
edge of the commonplace iron bed, she now opened instinctively at
Psalms 3 and 4.</p>

<p>"Lord, how are they increased that trouble."</p>

<p>"Hear me, when I call, O God of my righteousness."</p>

<p>And then reading on silently, even placidly apparently, through
6, 8, 10, 13, 23, 91, while Esta stood by in silent amazement and
misery.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mamma, I just can't believe it. Oh, this is too terrible!"
But Mrs. Griffiths read on. It was as if, and in spite of all this,
she had been able to retreat into some still, silent place, where,
for the time being at least, no evil human ill could reach her.
Then at last, quite calmly closing the book, and rising, she went
on:</p>

<p>"Now, we must think out what to say and who to send that
telegram to&mdash;I mean to Clyde, of course&mdash;at that place,
wherever it is&mdash; Bridgeburg," she added, looking at the paper,
and then interpolating from the Bible&mdash;"By terrible things in
righteousness wilt thou answer us, O God!" "Or, maybe, those two
lawyers&mdash;their names are there. I'm afraid to wire Asa's
brother for fear he'll wire back to him." (Then: 'Thou art my
bulwark and my strength. In Thee will I trust.') "But I suppose
they would give it to him if we sent it care of that judge or those
lawyers, don't you think? But it would be better if we could send
it to him direct, I suppose. ('He leadeth me by the still waters.')
Just say that I have read about him and still have faith and love
for him, but he is to tell me the truth and what to do. If he needs
money we will have to see what we can do, I suppose. ('He restoreth
my soul.')"</p>

<p>And then, despite her sudden peace of the moment, she once more
began wringing her large, rough hands. "Oh, it can't be true. Oh,
dear, no! After all, he is my son. We all love him and have faith.
We must say that. God will deliver him. Watch and pray. Have faith.
Under his wings shalt thou trust."</p>

<p>She was so beside herself that she scarcely knew what she was
saying. And Esta, at her side, was saying: "Yes, Mamma! Oh, of
course! Yes, I will! I know he'll get it all right." But she, too,
was saying to herself: "My God! My God! What could be worse than
this&mdash;to be accused of murder! But, of course, it can't be
true. It can't be true. If he should hear!" (She was thinking of
her husband.) "And after Russell, too. And Clyde's trouble there in
Kansas City. Poor Mamma. She has so much trouble."</p>

<p>Together, after a time, and avoiding Asa who was in an adjoining
room helping with the cleaning, the two made their way to the
general mission room below, where was silence and many placards
which proclaimed the charity, the wisdom, and the sustaining
righteousness of God.</p>

<h3>Chapter 18</h3>

<p>The telegram, worded in the spirit just described, was forthwith
despatched care of Belknap and Jephson, who immediately counseled
Clyde what to reply&mdash;that all was well with him; that he had
the best of advice and would need no financial aid. Also that until
his lawyers advised it, it would be best if no member of the family
troubled to appear, since everything that could possibly be done to
aid him was already being done. At the same time they wrote Mrs.
Griffiths, assuring her of their interest in Clyde and advising her
to let matters rest as they were for the present.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that the Griffiths were thus restrained from
appearing in the east, neither Belknap nor Jephson were averse to
some news of the existence, whereabouts, faith and sympathy of
Clyde's most immediate relatives creeping into the newspapers,
since the latter were so persistent in referring to his isolation.
And in this connection they were aided by the fact that his
mother's telegram on being received in Bridgeburg was at once read
by individuals who were particularly interested in the case and by
them whispered to the public and the press, with the result that in
Denver the family was at once sought out and interviewed. And
shortly after, there was circulated in all the papers east and west
a more or less complete account of the present state of Clyde's
family, the nature of the mission conducted by them, as well as
their narrow and highly individualistic religious beliefs and
actions, even the statement that often in his early youth Clyde had
been taken into the streets to sing and pray&mdash;a revelation
which shocked Lycurgus and Twelfth Lake society about as much as it
did him.</p>

<p>At the same time, Mrs. Griffiths, being an honest woman and
whole-heartedly sincere in her faith and in the good of her work,
did not hesitate to relate to reporter after reporter who called,
all the details of the missionary work of her husband and herself
in Denver and elsewhere. Also that neither Clyde nor any of the
other children had ever enjoyed the opportunities that come to
most. However, her boy, whatever the present charge might be, was
not innately bad, and she could not believe that he was guilty of
any such crime. It was all an unfortunate and accidental
combination of circumstances which he would explain at the trial.
However, whatever foolish thing he might have done, it was all to
be attributed to an unfortunate accident which broke up the mission
work in Kansas City a few years before and compelled the removal of
the family from there to Denver, leaving Clyde to make his way
alone. And it was because of advice from her that he had written
her husband's rich brother in Lycurgus, which led to his going
there&mdash;a series of statements which caused Clyde in his cell
to tingle with a kind of prideful misery and resentment and forced
him to write his mother and complain. Why need she always talk so
much about the past and the work that she and his father were
connected with, when she knew that he had never liked it and
resented going on the streets? Many people didn't see it as she and
his father did, particularly his uncle and cousin and all those
rich people he had come to know, and who were able to make their
way in so different and much more brilliant fashion. And now, as he
said to himself, Sondra would most certainly read this&mdash;all
that he had hoped to conceal.</p>

<p>Yet even in the face of all this, because of so much sincerity
and force in his mother, he could not help but think of her with
affection and respect, and because of her sure and unfailing love
for him, with emotion. For in answer to his letter she wrote that
she was sorry if she had hurt his feelings or injured him in any
way. But must not the truth be shown always? The ways of God were
for the best and surely no harm could spring from service in His
cause. He must not ask her to lie. But if he said the word, she
would so gladly attempt to raise the necessary money and come to
his aid&mdash;sit in his cell and plan with him&mdash;holding his
hands&mdash;but as Clyde so well knew and thought at this time and
which caused him to decide that she must not come
yet&mdash;demanding of him the truth&mdash; with those clear,
steady blue eyes of hers looking into his own. He could not stand
that now.</p>

<p>For, frowning directly before him, like a huge and basalt
headland above a troubled and angry sea, was the trial itself, with
all that it implied&mdash;the fierce assault of Mason which he
could only confront, for the most part, with the lies framed for
him by Jephson and Belknap. For, although he was constantly seeking
to salve his conscience with the thought that at the last moment he
had not had the courage to strike Roberta, nevertheless this other
story was so terribly difficult for him to present and
defend&mdash;a fact which both Belknap and Jephson realized and
which caused the latter to appear most frequently at Clyde's cell
door with the greeting: "Well, how's tricks to-day?"</p>

<p>The peculiarly rusty and disheveled and indifferently tailored
character of Jephson's suits! The worn and disarranged effect of
his dark brown soft hat, pulled low over his eyes! His long, bony,
knotty hands, suggesting somehow an enormous tensile strength. And
the hard, small blue eyes filled with a shrewd, determined cunning
and courage, with which he was seeking to inoculate Clyde, and
which somehow did inoculate him!</p>

<p>"Any more preachers around to-day? Any more country girls or
Mason's boys?" For during this time, because of the enormous
interest aroused by the pitiable death of Roberta, as well as the
evidence of her rich and beautiful rival, Clyde was being visited
by every type of shallow crime-or-sex-curious country bumpkin
lawyer, doctor, merchant, yokel evangelist or minister, all friends
or acquaintances of one or another of the officials of the city,
and who, standing before his cell door betimes, and at the most
unexpected moments, and after surveying him with curious, or
resentful, or horrified eyes, asked such questions as: "Do you
pray, brother? Do you get right down on your knees and pray?"
(Clyde was reminded of his mother and father at such times.) Had he
made his peace with God? Did he actually deny that he had killed
Roberta Alden? In the case of three country girls: "Would you mind
telling us the name of the girl you are supposed to be in love
with, and where she is now? We won't tell any one. Will she appear
at the trial?" Questions which Clyde could do no more than ignore,
or if not, answer as equivocally or evasively or indifferently as
possible. For although he was inclined to resent them, still was he
not being constantly instructed by both Belknap and Jephson that
for the good of his own cause he must try to appear genial and
civil and optimistic? Then there came also newspaper men, or women,
accompanied by artists or photographers, to interview and make
studies of him. But with these, for the most part and on the advice
of Belknap and Jephson he refused to communicate or said only what
he was told to say.</p>

<p>"You can talk all you want," suggested Jephson, genially, "so
long as you don't say anything. And the stiff upper lip, you know.
And the smile that won't come off, see? Not failing to go over that
list, are you?" (He had provided Clyde with a long list of possible
questions which no doubt would be asked him on the stand and which
he was to answer according to answers typewritten beneath them, or
to suggest something better. They all related to the trip to Big
Bittern, his reason for the extra hat, his change of heart&mdash;
why, when, where.) "That's your litany, you know." And then he
might light a cigarette without ever offering one to Clyde, since
for the sake of a reputation for sobriety he was not to smoke
here.</p>

<p>And for a time, after each visit, Clyde finding himself
believing that he could and would do exactly as Jephson had
said&mdash;walk briskly and smartly into court&mdash;bear up
against every one, every eye, even that of Mason
himself&mdash;forget that he was afraid of him, even when on the
witness stand&mdash;forget all the terror of those many facts in
Mason's possession, which he was to explain with this list of
answers&mdash;forget Roberta and her last cry, and all the
heartache and misery that went with the loss of Sondra and her
bright world.</p>

<p>Yet, with the night having once more fallen, or the day dragging
on with only the lean and bearded Kraut or the sly and evasive
Sissel, or both, hanging about, or coming to the door to say,
"Howdy!" or to discuss something that had occurred in town, or to
play chess, or checkers, Clyde growing more and more moody and
deciding, maybe, that there was no real hope for him after all. For
how alone he was, except for his attorneys and mother and brother
and sisters! Never a word from Sondra, of course. For along with
her recovery to some extent from her original shock and horror, she
was now thinking somewhat differently of him&mdash;that after all
it was for love of her, perhaps, that he had slain Roberta and made
himself the pariah and victim that he now was. Yet, because of the
immense prejudice and horror expressed by the world, she was by no
means able to think of venturing to send him a word. Was he not a
murderer? And in addition, that miserable western family of his,
pictured as street preachers, and he, too,&mdash;or as a singing
and praying boy from a mission! Yet occasionally returning in
thought, and this quite in spite of herself, to his eager,
unreasoning and seemingly consuming enthusiasm for her. (How deeply
he must have cared to venture upon so deadly a deed!) And hence
wondering whether at some time, once this case was less violently
before the public eye, it might not be possible to communicate with
him in some guarded and unsigned way, just to let him know,
perhaps, that because of his great love for her she desired him to
know that he was not entirely forgotten. Yet as instantly deciding,
<i>no</i>, no&mdash;her parents&mdash;if they should learn&mdash;or
guess&mdash;or the public, or her one-time associates. Not now, oh,
not now at least. Maybe later if he were set
free&mdash;or&mdash;or&mdash;convicted&mdash;she couldn't tell. Yet
suffering heartaches for the most part&mdash;as much as she
detested and abhorred the horrible crime by which he had sought to
win her.</p>

<p>And in the interim, Clyde in his cell, walking to and fro, or
looking out on the dull square through the heavily barred windows,
or reading and re-reading the newspapers, or nervously turning the
pages of magazines or books furnished by his counsel, or playing
chess or checkers, or eating his meals, which, by special
arrangement on the part of Belknap and Jephson (made at the request
of his uncle), consisted of better dishes than were usually
furnished to the ordinary prisoner.</p>

<p>Yet with the iterated and reiterated thought, based on the
seemingly irreparable and irreconcilable loss of Sondra, as to
whether it was possible for him to go on with this&mdash;make this,
as he at times saw it, almost useless fight.</p>

<p>At times, in the middle of the night or just before dawn, with
all the prison silent&mdash;dreams&mdash;a ghastly picture of all
that he most feared and that dispelled every trace of courage and
drove him instantly to his feet, his heart pounding wildly, his
eyes strained, a cold damp upon his face and hands. That chair,
somewhere in the State penitentiary. He had read of it&mdash;how
men died in it. And then he would walk up and down, thinking how,
how, in case it did not come about as Jephson felt so sure that it
would&mdash;in case he was convicted and a new trial
refused&mdash;then, well&mdash;then, might one be able to break out
of such a jail as this, maybe, and run away? These old brick walls.
How thick were they? But was it possible that with a hammer or a
stone, or something that some one might bring him&mdash;his brother
Frank, or his sister Julia, or Ratterer, or Hegglund&mdash;if only
he could get in communication with some one of them and get him or
her to bring him something of the kind&mdash;If only he could get a
saw, to saw those bars! And then run, run, as he should have in
those woods up there that time! But how? And whither?</p>

<h3>Chapter 19</h3>

<p><i>October</i> 15&mdash;with gray clouds and a sharp, almost
January wind that herded the fallen leaves into piles and then
scurried them in crisp and windy gusts like flying birds here and
there. And, in spite of the sense of struggle and tragedy in the
minds of many, with an electric chair as the shadowy mental
background to it all, a sense of holiday or festival, with hundreds
of farmers, woodsmen, traders, entering in Fords and
Buicks&mdash;farmer wives and husbands&mdash; daughters and
sons&mdash;even infants in arms. And then idling about the public
square long before the time for court to convene, or, as the hour
neared, congregating before the county jail in the hope of
obtaining a glimpse of Clyde, or before the courthouse door nearest
the jail, which was to be the one entrance to the courtroom for the
public and Clyde, and from which position they could see and assure
entrance into the courtroom itself when the time came. And a flock
of pigeons parading rather dismally along the cornices and gutters
of the upper floor and roof of the ancient court.</p>

<p>And with Mason and his staff&mdash;Burton Burleigh, Earl
Newcomb, Zillah Saunders, and a young Bridgeburg law graduate by
the name of Manigault&mdash;helping to arrange the order of
evidence as well as direct or instruct the various witnesses and
venire-men who were already collecting in the antechamber of the
now almost nationally known attorney for the people. And with cries
outside of: "Peanuts!" "Popcorn!" "Hot dogs!" "Get the story of
Clyde Griffiths, with all the letters of Roberta Alden. Only
twenty-five cents!" (This being a set of duplicate copies of
Roberta's letters which had been stolen from Mason's office by an
intimate of Burton Burleigh's and by him sold to a penny-dreadful
publisher of Binghamton, who immediately issued them in pamphlet
form together with an outline of "the great plot" and Roberta's and
Clyde's pictures.)</p>

<p>And in the meantime, over in the reception or conference room of
the jail, Alvin Belknap and Reuben Jephson, side by side with
Clyde, neatly arrayed in the very suit he had sought to sink
forever in the waters of Lower Twelfth Lake. And with a new tie and
shirt and shoes added in order to present him in his Lycurgus best.
Jephson, long and lean and shabbily dressed as usual, but with all
of that iron and power that so impressed Clyde in every line of his
figure and every movement or gesture of his body.
Belknap&mdash;looking like an Albany beau&mdash;the one on whom was
to fall the burden of the opening presentation of the case as well
as the cross-examining, now saying: "Now you're not going to get
frightened or show any evidence of nervousness at anything that may
be said or done at any time, are you, Clyde? We're to be with you,
you know, all through the trial. You sit right between us. And
you're going to smile and look unconcerned or interested, just as
you wish, but never fearful&mdash;but not too bold or gay, you
know, so that they'd feel that you're not taking this thing
seriously. You understand&mdash;just a pleasant, gentlemanly, and
sympathetic manner all the time. And not frightened. For that will
be certain to do us and you great harm. Since you're innocent, you
have no real reason to be frightened&mdash;although you're sorry,
of course. You understand all that, I know, by now."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I understand," replied Clyde. "I will do just as you
say. Besides, I never struck her intentionally, and that's the
truth. So why should I be afraid?" And here he looked at Jephson,
on whom, for psychic reasons, he depended most. In fact the words
he had just spoken were the very words which Jephson had so drilled
into him during the two months just past. And catching the look,
Jephson now drew closer and fixing Clyde with his gimlet and yet
encouraging and sustaining blue eyes, began:</p>

<p>"You're not guilty! You're not guilty, Clyde, see? You
understand that fully by now, and you must always believe and
remember that, because it's true. You didn't intend to strike her,
do you hear? You swear to that. You have sworn it to me and Belknap
here, and we believe you. Now, it doesn't make the least bit of
difference that because of the circumstances surrounding all this
we are not going to be able to make the average jury see this or
believe it just as you tell it. That's neither here nor there. I've
told you that before. You know what the truth is&mdash;and so do
we. <i>But</i>, in order to get justice for you, we've had to get
up something else&mdash;a dummy or substitute for the real fact,
which is that you didn't strike her intentionally, but which we
cannot hope to make them see without disguising it in some way. You
get that, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied Clyde, always over-awed and intrigued by
this man.</p>

<p>"And for that reason, as I've so often told you, we've invented
this other story about a change of heart. It's not quite true as to
time, but it is true that you did experience a change of heart
there in the boat. And that's our justification. But they'd never
believe that under all of the peculiar circumstances, so we're
merely going to move that change of heart up a little, see? Make it
before you ever went into that boat at all. And while we know it
isn't true that way, still neither is the charge that you
intentionally struck her true, and they're not going to electrocute
you for something that isn't true&mdash;not with my consent, at
least." He looked into Clyde's eyes for a moment more, and then
added: "It's this way, Clyde. It's like having to pay for potatoes,
or for suits of clothes, with corn or beans instead of money, when
you have money to pay with but when, because of the crazy notions
on the part of some one, they won't believe that the money you have
is genuine. So you've got to use the potatoes or beans. And beans
is what we're going to give 'em. But the justification is that
you're not guilty. You're not guilty. You've sworn to me that you
didn't intend to strike her there at the last, whatever you might
have been provoked to do at first. And that's enough for me. You're
not guilty."</p>

<p>And here, firmly and convincingly, which was the illusion in
regard to his own attitude which he was determined to convey to
Clyde, he laid hold of his coat lapels, and after looking fixedly
into his somewhat strained and now nervous brown eyes, added: "And
now, whenever you get to feeling weak or nervous, or if, when you
go on the stand, you think Mason is getting the best of you, I want
you to remember this&mdash;just say to yourself&mdash;'I'm not
guilty! I'm not guilty! And they can't fairly convict me unless I
really am.' And if that don't pull you together, look at me. I'll
be right there. All you have to do, if you feel yourself rattled,
is to look at me&mdash; right into my eyes, just as I'm looking at
you now&mdash;and then you'll know that I'm wanting you to brace up
and do what I'm telling you to do now&mdash;swear to the things
that we are asking you to swear to, however they may look like
lies, and however you may feel about them. I'm not going to have
you convicted for something you didn't do, just because you can't
be allowed to swear to what is the truth&mdash;not if I can help
it. And now that's all."</p>

<p>And here he slapped him genially and heartily on the back, while
Clyde, strangely heartened, felt, for the time being at least, that
certainly he could do as he was told, and would.</p>

<p>And then Jephson, taking out his watch and looking first at
Belknap, then out of the nearest window through which were to be
seen the already assembled crowds&mdash;one about the courthouse
steps; a second including newspapermen and women, newspaper
photographers and artists, gathered closely before the jail walk,
and eagerly waiting to "snap" Clyde or any one connected with this
case&mdash;went calmly on with:</p>

<p>"Well, it's about time, I guess. Looks as though all Cataraqui
would like to get inside. We're going to have quite an audience."
And turning to Clyde once more, he added: "Now, you don't want to
let those people disturb you, Clyde. They're nothing but a lot of
country people come to town to see a show."</p>

<p>And then the two of them, Belknap and Jephson, going out. And
Kraut and Sissel coming in to take personal charge of Clyde, while
the two lawyers, passing amid whispers, crossed over to the court
building in the square of brown grass beyond.</p>

<p>And after them, and in less than five minutes, and preceded by
Slack and Sissel and followed by Kraut and Swenk&mdash;yet
protected on either side by two extra deputies in case there should
be an outbreak or demonstration of any kind&mdash;Clyde himself,
attempting to look as jaunty and nonchalant as possible, yet
because of the many rough and strange faces about him&mdash;men in
heavy raccoon coats and caps, and with thick whiskers, or in worn
and faded and nondescript clothes such as characterized many of the
farmers of this region, accompanied by their wives and children,
and all staring so strangely and curiously&mdash;he felt not a
little nervous, as though at any moment there might be a revolver
shot, or some one might leap at him with a knife&mdash;the deputies
with their hands on their guns lending not a little to the reality
of his mood. Yet only cries of: "Here he comes! Here he comes!"
"There he is!" "Would you believe that he could do a thing like
that?"</p>

<p>And then the cameras clicking and whirring and his two
protectors shouldering closer and closer to him while he shrank
down within himself mentally.</p>

<p>And then a flight of five brown stone steps leading up to an old
courthouse door. And beyond that, an inner flight of steps to a
large, long, brown, high-ceilinged chamber, in which, to the right
and left, and in the rear facing east, were tall, thin,
round-topped windows, fitted with thin panes, admitting a flood of
light. And at the west end, a raised platform, with a highly
ornamental, dark brown carved bench upon it. And behind it, a
portrait&mdash;and on either side, north and south, and at the
rear, benches and benches in rows&mdash;each tier higher than the
other, and all crowded with people, the space behind them packed
with standing bodies, and all apparently, as he entered, leaning
and craning and examining him with sharp keen eyes, while there
went about a conversational buzz or brrh. He could hear a general
sssss&mdash;pppp&mdash;as he approached and passed through a gate
to an open space beyond it, wherein, as he could see, were Belknap
and Jephson at a table, and between them a vacant chair for him.
And he could see and feel the eyes and faces on which he was not
quite willing to look.</p>

<p>But directly before him, at another table in the same square,
but more directly below the raised platform at the west end, as he
could see now, were Mason and several men whom he seemed to
recollect&mdash;Earl Newcomb and Burton Burleigh and yet another
man whom he had never seen before, all four turning and gazing at
him as he came.</p>

<p>And about this inner group, an outer circle of men and women
writers and sketch artists.</p>

<p>And then, after a time, recalling Belknap's advice, he managed
to straighten up and with an air of studied ease and
courage&mdash;which was belied to a certain extent by his strained,
pale face and somewhat hazy stare&mdash;look at the writers and
artists who were either studying or sketching him, and even to
whisper: "Quite a full house, eh?" But just then, and before he
could say anything more, a resounding whack, whack, from somewhere.
And then a voice: "Order in the Court! His Honor, the Court!
Everybody please rise!" And as suddenly the whispering and stirring
audience growing completely silent. And then, through a door to the
south of the dais, a large urbane and florid and smooth-faced man,
who in an ample black gown, walked swiftly to the large chair
immediately behind the desk, and after looking steadily upon all
before him, but without appearing to see any one of them seated
himself. Whereupon every one assembled in the courtroom sat
down.</p>

<p>And then to the left, yet below the judge, at a smaller desk, a
smaller and older individual standing and calling, "Oyez! Oyez! All
persons having business before the honorable, the Supreme Court of
the State of New York, County of Cataraqui, draw near and give
attention. This court is now in session!"</p>

<p>And after that this same individual again rising and beginning:
"The State of New York against Clyde Griffiths." Then Mason, rising
and standing before his table, at once announced: "The People are
ready." Whereupon Belknap arose, and in a courtly and affable
manner, stated: "The defendant is ready."</p>

<p>Then the same clerk reached into a square box that was before
him, and drawing forth a piece of paper, called "Simeon Dinsmore,"
whereupon a little, hunched and brown-suited man, with claw-like
hands, and a ferret-like face, immediately scuttled to the jury box
and was seated. And once there he was approached by Mason, who, in
a brisk manner&mdash;his flat-nosed face looking most aggressive
and his strong voice reaching to the uttermost corners of the
court, began to inquire as to his age, his business, whether he was
single or married, how many children he had, whether he believed or
did not believe in capital punishment. The latter question as Clyde
at once noted seemed to stir in him something akin to resentment or
suppressed emotion of some kind, for at once and with emphasis, he
answered: "I most certainly do&mdash;for some people"&mdash;a reply
which caused Mason to smile slightly and Jephson to turn and look
toward Belknap, who mumbled sarcastically: "And they talk about the
possibility of a fair trial here." But at the same time Mason
feeling that this very honest, if all too convinced farmer, was a
little too emphatic in his beliefs, saying: "With the consent of
the Court, the People will excuse the talesman." And Belknap, after
an inquiring glance from the Judge, nodding his agreement, at which
the prospective juror was excused.</p>

<p>And the clerk, immediately drawing out of the box a second slip
of paper, and then calling: "Dudley Sheerline!" Whereupon, a thin,
tall man of between thirty-eight and forty, neatly dressed and
somewhat meticulous and cautious in his manner, approached and took
his place in the box. And Mason once more began to question him as
he had the other.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Clyde, in spite of both Belknap's and Jephson's
preliminary precautions, was already feeling stiff and chill and
bloodless. For, decidedly, as he could feel, this audience was
inimical. And amid this closely pressing throng, as he now thought,
with an additional chill, there must be the father and mother,
perhaps also the sisters and brothers, of Roberta, and all looking
at him, and hoping with all their hearts, as the newspapers during
the weeks past informed him, that he would be made to suffer for
this.</p>

<p>And again, all those people of Lycurgus and Twelfth Lake, no one
of whom had troubled to communicate with him in any way, assuming
him to be absolutely guilty, of course&mdash;were any of those
here? Jill or Gertrude or Tracy Trumbull, for instance? Or Wynette
Phant or her brother? She had been at that camp at Bear Lake the
day he was arrested. His mind ran over all the social personages
whom he had encountered during the last year and who would now see
him as he was&mdash;poor and commonplace and deserted, and on trial
for such a crime as this. And after all his bluffing about his rich
connections here and in the west. For now, of course, they would
believe him as terrible as his original plot, without knowing or
caring about his side of the story&mdash;his moods and
fears&mdash;that predicament that he was in with Roberta&mdash;his
love for Sondra and all that she had meant to him. They wouldn't
understand that, and he was not going to be allowed to tell
anything in regard to it, even if he were so minded.</p>

<p>And yet, because of the advice of Belknap and Jephson, he must
sit up and smile, or at least look pleasant and meet the gaze of
every one boldly and directly. And in consequence, turning, and for
the moment feeling absolutely transfixed. For there&mdash;God, what
a resemblance!&mdash;to the left of him on one of those wall
benches, was a woman or girl who appeared to be the living image of
Roberta! It was that sister of hers&mdash;Emily&mdash;of whom she
had often spoken&mdash;but oh, what a shock! His heart almost
stopped. It might even be Roberta! And transfixing him with what
ghostly, and yet real, and savage and accusing eyes! And next to
her another girl, looking something like her, too&mdash;and next to
her that old man, Roberta's father&mdash;that wrinkled old man whom
he had encountered that day he had called at his farm door for
information, now looking at him almost savagely, a gray and weary
look that said so plainly: "You murderer! You murderer!" And beside
him a mild and small and ill-looking woman of about fifty, veiled
and very shrunken and sunken-eyed, who, at his glance dropped her
own eyes and turned away, as if stricken with a great pain, not
hate. Her mother&mdash;no doubt of it. Oh, what a situation was
this! How unthinkably miserable! His heart fluttered. His hands
trembled.</p>

<p>So now to stay himself, he looked down, first at the hands of
Belknap and Jephson on the table before him, since each was toying
with a pencil poised above the pad of paper before them, as they
gazed at Mason and whoever was in the jury box before him&mdash;a
foolish-looking fat man now. What a difference between Jephson's
and Belknap's hands&mdash;the latter so short and soft and white,
the former's so long and brown and knotty and bony. And Belknap's
pleasant and agreeable manner here in court&mdash;his
voice&mdash;"I think I will ask the juror to step down"&mdash;as
opposed to Mason's revolver-like "Excused!" or Jephson's slow and
yet powerful, though whispered, "Better let him go, Alvin. Nothing
in him for us." And then all at once Jephson saying to him: "Sit
up! Sit up! Look around! Don't sag down like that. Look people in
the eye. Smile naturally, Clyde, if you're going to smile at all,
just look 'em in the eye. They're not going to hurt you. They're
just a lot of farmers out sightseeing."</p>

<p>But Clyde, noting at once that several reporters and artists
were studying and then sketching or writing of him, now flushed
hotly and weakly, for he could feel their eager eyes and their
eager words as clearly as he could hear their scratching pens. And
all for the papers&mdash;his blanching face and trembling
hands&mdash;they would have that down&mdash;and his mother in
Denver and everybody else there in Lycurgus would see and
read&mdash;how he had looked at the Aldens and they had looked at
him and then he had looked away again. Still&mdash; still&mdash;he
must get himself better in hand&mdash;sit up once more and look
about&mdash;or Jephson would be disgusted with him. And so once
more he did his best to crush down his fear, to raise his eyes and
then turn slightly and look about.</p>

<p>But in doing so, there next to the wall, and to one side of that
tall window, and just as he had feared, was Tracy Trumbull, who
evidently because of the law interest or his curiosity and what
not&mdash;no pity or sympathy for him, surely&mdash;had come up for
this day anyhow, and was looking, not at him for the moment, thank
goodness, but at Mason, who was asking the fat man some questions.
And next to him Eddie Sells, with nearsighted eyes equipped with
thick lenses of great distance-power, and looking in Clyde's
direction, yet without seeing him apparently, for he gave no sign.
Oh, how trying all this!</p>

<p>And five rows from them again, in another direction, Mr. and
Mrs. Gilpin, whom Mason had found, of course. And what would they
testify to now? His calling on Roberta in her room there? And how
secret it had all been? That would be bad, of course. And of all
people, Mr. and Mrs. George Newton! What were they going to put
them on the stand for? To tell about Roberta's life before she got
to going with him, maybe? And that Grace Marr, whom he had seen
often but met only once out there on Crum Lake, and whom Roberta
had not liked any more. What would she have to say? She could tell
how he had met Roberta, of course, but what else? And then&mdash;
but, no, it could not be&mdash;and yet&mdash;yet, it was,
too&mdash;surely&mdash;that Orrin Short, of whom he had asked
concerning Glenn. Gee!&mdash;he was going to tell about that now,
maybe&mdash;no doubt of it. How people seemed to remember
things&mdash;more than ever he would have dreamed they would
have.</p>

<p>And again, this side of that third window from the front, but
beyond that dreaded group of the Aldens, that very large and
whiskered man who looked something like an old-time Quaker turned
bandit&mdash;Heit was his name. He had met him at Three Mile Bay,
and again on that day on which he had been taken up to Big Bittern
against his will. Oh, yes, the coroner he was. And beside him, that
innkeeper up there who had made him sign the register that day. And
next to him the boathouse-keeper who had rented him the boat. And
next to him, that tall, lank guide who had driven him and Roberta
over from Gun Lodge, a brown and wiry and loutish man who seemed to
pierce him now with small, deep-set, animal-like eyes, and who most
certainly was going to testify to all the details of that ride from
Gun Lodge. Would his nervousness on that day, and his foolish
qualms, be as clearly remembered by him as they were now by
himself. And if so, how would that affect his plea of a change of
heart? Would he not better talk all that over again with
Jephson?</p>

<p>But this man Mason! How hard he was! How energetic! And how he
must have worked to get all of these people here to testify against
him! And now here he was, exclaiming as he chanced to look at him,
and as he had in at least the last dozen cases (yet with no
perceptible result in so far as the jury box was concerned),
"Acceptable to the People!" But, invariably, whenever he had done
so, Jephson had merely turned slightly, but without looking, and
had said: "Nothing in him for us, Alvin. As set as a bone." And
then Belknap, courteous and bland, had challenged for cause and
usually succeeded in having his challenge sustained.</p>

<p>But then at last, and oh, how agreeably, the clerk of the court
announcing in a clear, thin, rasping and aged voice, a recess until
two P. M. And Jephson smilingly turning to Clyde with: "Well,
Clyde, that's the first round&mdash;not so very much to it, do you
think? And not very hard either, is it? Better go over there and
get a good meal, though. It'll be just as long and dull this
afternoon."</p>

<p>And in the meantime, Kraut and Sissel, together with the extra
deputies, pushing close and surrounding him. And then the crowding
and swarming and exclaiming: "There he is! There he is! Here he
comes! Here! Here!" And a large and meaty female pushing as close
as possible and staring directly into his face, exclaiming as she
did so: "Let me see him! I just want to get a good look at you,
young man. I have two daughters of my own." But without one of all
those of Lycurgus or Twelfth Lake whom he had recognized in the
public benches, coming near him. And no glimpse of Sondra anywhere,
of course. For as both Belknap and Jephson had repeatedly assured
him, she would not appear. Her name was not even to be mentioned,
if possible. The Griffiths, as well as the Finchleys, were
opposed.</p>

<h3>Chapter 20</h3>

<p>And then five entire days consumed by Mason and Belknap in
selecting a jury. But at last the twelve men who were to try Clyde,
sworn and seated. And such men&mdash;odd and grizzled, or tanned
and wrinkled, farmers and country storekeepers, with here and there
a Ford agent, a keeper of an inn at Tom Dixon's Lake, a salesman in
Hamburger's dry goods store at Bridgeburg, and a peripatetic
insurance agent residing in Purday just north of Grass Lake. And
with but one exception, all married. And with but one exception,
all religious, if not moral, and all convinced of Clyde's guilt
before ever they sat down, but still because of their almost
unanimous conception of themselves as fair and open-minded men, and
because they were so interested to sit as jurors in this exciting
case, convinced that they could pass fairly and impartially on the
facts presented to them.</p>

<p>And so, all rising and being sworn in.</p>

<p>And at once Mason rising and beginning: "Gentlemen of the
jury."</p>

<p>And Clyde, as well as Belknap and Jephson, now gazing at them
and wondering what the impression of Mason's opening charge was
likely to be. For a more dynamic and electric prosecutor under
these particular circumstances was not to be found. This was his
opportunity. Were not the eyes of all the citizens of the United
States upon him? He believed so. It was as if some one had suddenly
exclaimed: "Lights! Camera!"</p>

<p>"No doubt many of you have been wearied, as well as puzzled, at
times during the past week," he began, "by the exceeding care with
which the lawyers in this case have passed upon the panels from
which you twelve men have been chosen. It has been no light matter
to find twelve men to whom all the marshaled facts in this
astonishing cause could be submitted and by them weighed with all
the fairness and understanding which the law commands. For my part,
the care which I have exercised, gentlemen, has been directed by
but one motive&mdash;that the state shall have justice done. No
malice, no pre-conceived notions of any kind. So late as July 9th
last I personally was not even aware of the existence of this
defendant, nor of his victim, nor of the crime with which he is now
charged. But, gentlemen, as shocked and unbelieving as I was at
first upon hearing that a man of the age, training and connections
of the defendant here could have placed himself in a position to be
accused of such an offense, step by step I was compelled to alter
and then dismiss forever from my mind my original doubts and to
conclude from the mass of evidence that was literally thrust upon
me, that it was my duty to prosecute this action in behalf of the
people.</p>

<p>"But, however that may be, let us proceed to the facts. There
are two women in this action. One is dead. The other" (and he now
turned toward where Clyde sat, and here he pointed a finger in the
direction of Belknap and Jephson), "by agreement between the
prosecution and the defense is to be nameless here, since no good
can come from inflicting unnecessary injury. In fact, the sole
purpose which I now announce to you to be behind every word and
every fact as it will be presented by the prosecution is that exact
justice, according to the laws of this state and the crime with
which this defendant is charged, shall be done. <i>Exact
justice</i>, gentlemen, exact and fair. But if you do not act
honestly and render a true verdict according to the evidence, the
people of the state of New York and the people of the county of
Cataraqui will have a grievance and a serious one. For it is they
who are looking to you for a true accounting for your reasoning and
your final decision in this case."</p>

<p>And here Mason paused, and then turning dramatically toward
Clyde, and with his right index finger pointing toward him at
times, continued: "The people of the state of New York
<i>charge</i>," (and he hung upon this one word as though he
desired to give it the value of rolling thunder), "that the crime
of murder in the first degree has been committed by the prisoner at
the bar&mdash;Clyde Griffiths. They <i>charge</i> that he
willfully, and with malice and cruelty and deception, murdered and
then sought to conceal forever from the knowledge and the justice
of the world, the body of Roberta Alden, the daughter of a farmer
who has for years resided near the village of Biltz, in Mimico
County. They <i>charge</i>" (and here Clyde, because of whispered
advice from Jephson, was leaning back as comfortably as possible
and gazing as imperturbably as possible upon the face of Mason, who
was looking directly at him) "that this same Clyde Griffiths,
before ever this crime was committed by him, plotted for weeks the
plan and commission of it, and then, with malice aforethought and
in cold blood, executed it.</p>

<p>"And in charging these things, the people of the State of New
York expect to, and will, produce before you substantiations of
every one of them. You will be given facts, and of these facts you,
not I, are to be the sole judge."</p>

<p>And here he paused once more, and shifting to a different
physical position while the eager audience crowded and leaned
forward, hungry and thirsty for every word he should utter, he now
lifted one arm and dramatically pushing back his curly hair,
resumed:</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, it will not take me long to picture, nor will you
fail to perceive for yourselves as this case proceeds, the type of
girl this was whose life was so cruelly blotted out beneath the
waters of Big Bittern. All the twenty years of her life" (and Mason
knew well that she was twenty-three and two years older than Clyde)
"no person who ever knew her ever said one word in criticism of her
character. And no evidence to that effect, I am positive, will be
introduced in this trial. Somewhat over a year ago&mdash;on July
19&mdash; she went to the city of Lycurgus, in order that by
working with her own hands she might help her family." (And here
the sobs of her parents and sisters and brothers were heard
throughout the courtroom.)</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," went on Mason, and from this point carrying on the
picture of Roberta's life from the time she first left home to join
Grace Marr until, having met Clyde on Crum Lake and fallen out with
her friend and patrons, the Newtons, because of him, she accepted
his dictum that she live alone, amid strange people, concealing the
suspicious truth of this from her parents, and then finally
succumbing to his wiles&mdash;the letters she had written him from
Biltz detailing every single progressive step in this story. And
from there, by the same meticulous process, he proceeded to
Clyde&mdash;his interest in the affairs of Lycurgus society and the
rich and beautiful Miss X, who because of a purely innocent and
kindly, if infatuated, indication on her part that he might hope to
aspire to her hand&mdash;had unwittingly evoked in him a passion
which had been the cause of the sudden change in his attitude and
emotions toward Roberta, resulting, as Mason insisted he would
show, in the plot that had resulted in Roberta's death.</p>

<p>"But who is the individual," he suddenly and most dramatically
exclaimed at this point, "against whom I charge all these things?
There he sits! Is he the son of wastrel parents&mdash;a product of
the slums&mdash;one who had been denied every opportunity for a
proper or honorable conception of the values and duties of a decent
and respectable life? Is he? On the contrary. His father is of the
same strain that has given Lycurgus one of its largest and most
constructive industries&mdash;the Griffiths Collar &amp; Shirt
Company. He was poor&mdash;yes&mdash;no doubt of that. But not more
so than Roberta Alden&mdash;and her character appears not to have
been affected by her poverty. His parents in Kansas City, Denver,
and before that Chicago and Grand Rapids, Michigan, appear to have
been unordained ministers of the proselytizing and
mission-conducting type-people who, from all I can gather, are
really, sincerely religious and right-principled in every sense.
But this, their oldest son, and the one who might have been
expected to be deeply influenced by them, early turned from their
world and took to a more garish life. He became a bell-boy in a
celebrated Kansas City hotel, the Green-Davidson."</p>

<p>And now he proceeded to explain that Clyde had ever been a
rolling stone&mdash;one who, by reason of some quirk of
temperament, perhaps, preferred to wander here and there. Later, as
he now explained, he had been given an important position as head
of a department in the well-known factory of his uncle at Lycurgus.
And then gradually he was introduced into the circles in which his
uncle and his children were familiar. And his salary was such that
he could afford to keep a room in one of the better residences of
the city, while the girl he had slain lived in a mean room in a
back street.</p>

<p>"And yet," he continued, "how much has been made here of the
alleged youth of this defendant?" (Here he permitted himself a
scornful smile.) "He has been called by his counsel and others in
the newspapers a boy, over and over again. He is not a boy. He is a
bearded man. He has had more social and educational advantages than
any one of you in the jury box. He has traveled. In hotels and
clubs and the society with which he was so intimately connected in
Lycurgus, he has been in contact with decent, respectable, and even
able and distinguished people. Why, as a matter of fact, at the
time of his arrest two months ago, he was part of as smart a
society and summer resort group as this region boasts. Remember
that! His mind is a mature, not, an immature one. It is fully
developed and balanced perfectly.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, as the state will soon proceed to prove," he went
on, "it was no more than four months after his arrival in Lycurgus
that this dead girl came to work for the defendant in the
department of which he was the head. And it was not more than two
months after that before he had induced her to move from the
respectable and religious home which she had chosen in Lycurgus, to
one concerning which she knew nothing and the principal advantage
of which, as he saw it, was that it offered secrecy and seclusion
and freedom from observation for that vile purpose which already he
entertained in regard to her.</p>

<p>"There was a rule of the Griffiths Company, as we will later
show in this trial, which explains much&mdash;and that was that no
superior officer or head of any department was permitted to have
anything to do with any girls working under him, or for the
factory, in or out of the factory. It was not conducive to either
the morals or the honor of those working for this great company,
and they would not allow it. And shortly after coming there, this
man had been instructed as to that rule. But did that deter him?
Did the so recent and favorable consideration of his uncle in any
way deter him? Not in the least. Secrecy! Secrecy! From the very
beginning! Seduction! Seduction! The secret and intended and
immoral and illegal and socially unwarranted and condemned use of
her body outside the regenerative and ennobling pale of
matrimony!</p>

<p>"That was his purpose, gentlemen! But was it generally known by
any one in Lycurgus or elsewhere that such a relationship as this
existed between him and Roberta Alden? Not a soul! <i>Not a
soul</i>!, as far as I have been able to ascertain, was ever so
much as partially aware of this relationship until after this girl
was dead. Not a soul! Think of that!</p>

<p>"Gentlemen of the jury," and here his voice took on an almost
reverential tone, "Roberta Alden loved this defendant with all the
strength of her soul. She loved him with that love which is the
crowning mystery of the human brain and the human heart, that
transcends in its strength and its weakness all fear of shame or
punishment from even the immortal throne above. She was a true and
human and decent and kindly girl&mdash;a passionate and loving
girl. And she loved as only a generous and trusting and
self-sacrificing soul can love. And loving so, in the end she gave
to him all that any woman can give the man she loves.</p>

<p>"Friends, this thing has happened millions of times in this
world of ours, and it will happen millions and millions of times in
the days to come. It is not new and it will never be old.</p>

<p>"But in January or February last, this girl, who is now dead in
her grave, was compelled to come to this defendant, Clyde
Griffiths, and tell him that she was about to become a mother. We
shall prove to you that then and later she begged him to go away
with her and make her his wife.</p>

<p>"But did he? Would he? Oh, no! For by that time a change had
come over the dreams and the affections of Clyde Griffiths. He had
had time to discover that the name of Griffiths in Lycurgus was one
that would open the doors of Lycurgus exclusive circles&mdash;that
the man who was no one in Kansas City or Chicago&mdash;was very
much of a person here, and that it would bring him in contact with
girls of education and means, girls who moved far from the sphere
to which Roberta Alden belonged. Not only that, but he had found
one girl to whom, because of her beauty, wealth, position, he had
become enormously attached and beside her the little farm and
factory girl in the pathetically shabby and secret room to which he
had assigned her, looked poor indeed&mdash;good enough to betray
but not good enough to marry. And he would not." Here he paused,
but only for a moment, then went on:</p>

<p>"But at no point have I been able to find the least modification
or cessation of any of these social activities on his part which so
entranced him. On the contrary, from January to July fifth last,
and after&mdash;yes, even after she was finally compelled to say to
him that unless he could take her away and marry her, she would
have to appeal to the sense of justice in the community in which
they moved, and after she was cold and dead under the waters of Big
Bittern&mdash;dances, lawn fetes, automobile parties, dinners, gay
trips to Twelfth Lake and Bear Lake, and without a thought,
seemingly, that her great moral and social need should modify his
conduct in any way."</p>

<p>And here he paused and gazed in the direction of Belknap and
Jephson, who in turn, were not sufficiently disturbed or concerned
to do more than smile, first at him and then at each other,
although Clyde, terrorized by the force and the vehemence of it
all, was chiefly concerned to note how much of exaggeration and
unfairness was in all this.</p>

<p>But even as he was thinking so, Mason was continuing with: "But
by this time, gentlemen, as I have indicated, Roberta Alden had
become insistent that Griffiths make her his wife. And this he
promised to do. Yet, as all the evidence here will show, he never
intended to do anything of the kind. On the contrary, when her
condition became such that he could no longer endure her pleas or
the danger which her presence in Lycurgus unquestionably spelled
for him, he induced her to go home to her father's house, with the
suggestion, apparently, that she prepare herself by making some
necessary clothes, against the day when he would come for her and
remove her to some distant city where they would not be known, yet
where as his wife she could honorably bring their child into the
world. And according to her letters to him, as I will show, that
was to have been in three weeks from the time she departed for her
home in Biltz. But did he come for her as he had promised? No, he
never did.</p>

<p>"Eventually, and solely because there was no other way out, he
permitted her to come to him&mdash;on July sixth last&mdash;exactly
two days before her death. But not before&mdash;but wait!&mdash;In
the meantime, or from June fifth to July sixth, he allowed her to
brood in that little, lonely farm-house on the outskirts of Biltz
in Mimico County, with the neighbors coming in to watch and help
her make some clothes, which even then she did not dare announce as
her bridal trousseau. And she suspected and feared that this
defendant would fail her. For daily, and sometimes twice daily, she
wrote him, telling him of her fears and asking him to assure her by
letter or word in some form that he would come and take her
away.</p>

<p>"But did he even do that? Never by letter! <i>Never</i>! Oh, no,
gentlemen, oh, no! On the contrary some telephone
messages&mdash;things that could not be so easily traced or
understood. And these so few and brief that she herself complained
bitterly of his lack of interest and consideration for her at this
time. So much so that at the end of five weeks, growing desperate,
she wrote" (and here Mason picked from a collection of letters on
the table behind him a particular letter, and read): "'This is to
tell you that unless I hear from you either by telephone or letter
before noon Friday, I will come to Lycurgus and the world will know
how you have treated me.' Those are the words, gentlemen, that this
poor girl was at last compelled to write.</p>

<p>"But did Clyde Griffiths want the world to know how he had
treated her? Of course not! And there and then began to form in his
mind a plan by which he could escape exposure and seal Roberta
Alden's lips forever. And, gentlemen, the state will prove that he
did so close her mouth."</p>

<p>At this point Mason produced a map of the Adirondacks which he
had had made for the purpose, and on which in red ink were traced
the movements of Clyde up to and after her death&mdash;up to the
time of his arrest at Big Bear. Also, in doing this, he paused to
tell the jury of Clyde's well-conceived plan of hiding his
identity, the various false registrations, the two hats. Here also
he explained that on the train between Fonda and Utica, as again
between Utica and Grass Lake, he had not ridden in the same car
with Roberta. And then he announced:</p>

<p>"Don't forget, gentlemen, that although he had previously
indicated to Roberta that this was to be their wedding journey, he
did not want anybody to know that he was with his prospective
bride&mdash;no, not even after they had reached Big Bittern. For he
was seeking, not to marry but to find a wilderness in which to
snuff out the life of this girl of whom he had tired. But did that
prevent him, twenty-four and forty-eight hours before that time,
from holding her in his arms and repeating the promises he had no
intention of keeping? Did it? I will show you the registers of the
two hotels in which they stayed, and where, because of their
assumed approaching marriage, they occupied a single room together.
Yet the only reason it was forty-eight instead of twenty-four hours
was that he had made a mistake in regard to the solitude of Grass
Lake. Finding it brisk with life, the center of a summer religious
colony, he decided to leave and go to Big Bittern, which was more
lonely. And so you have the astounding and bitter spectacle,
gentlemen, of a supposedly innocent and highly misunderstood young
man dragging this weary and heart-sick girl from place to place, in
order to find a lake deserted enough in which to drown her. And
with her but four months from motherhood!</p>

<p>"And then, having arrived at last at one lake lonely enough,
putting her in a boat and taking her out from the inn where he had
again falsely registered as Mr. Clifford Golden and wife, to her
death. The poor little thing imagined that she was going for a
brief outing before that marriage of which he talked and which was
to seal and sanctify it. To seal and sanctify it! To seal and
sanctify, as closing waters seal and sanctify, but in no other
way&mdash; no other way. And with him walking, whole and
sly&mdash;as a wolf from its kill&mdash;to freedom, to marriage, to
social and material and affectionate bliss and superiority and
ease, while she slept still and nameless in her watery grave.</p>

<p>"But, oh, gentlemen, the ways of nature, or of God, and the
Providence that shapes our ends, rough-hew them how we may! It is
man who proposes, but God&mdash;God&mdash;who disposes!</p>

<p>"The defendant is still wondering, I am sure, as to how I know
that she thought she was still going to be married after leaving
the inn at Big Bittern. And I have no doubt that he still has some
comforting thoughts to the effect that I cannot really and truly
know it. But how shrewd and deep must be that mind that would
foresee and forestall all the accidents and chances of life. For,
as he sits there now, secure in the faith that his counsel may be
able to extract him safely from this" (and at this Clyde sat bolt
upright, his hair tingling, and his hands concealed beneath the
table, trembling slightly), "he does not know that that girl, while
in her room in the Grass Lake Inn, had written her mother a letter,
which she had not had time to mail, and which was in the pocket of
her coat left behind because of the heat of the day, and because
she imagined she was coming back, of course. And which is here now
upon this table."</p>

<p>At this Clyde's teeth fairly chattered. He shook as with a
chill. To be sure, she had left her coat behind! And Belknap and
Jephson also sat up, wondering what this could be. How fatally, if
at all, could it mar or make impossible the plan of defense which
they had evolved? They could only wait and see.</p>

<p>"But in that letter," went on Mason, "she tells why she was up
there&mdash;to be married, no less" (and at this point Jephson and
Belknap, as well as Clyde, heaved an enormous sigh of
relief&mdash;it was directly in the field of their plan) "and
within a day or two," continued Mason, thinking still that he was
literally riddling Clyde with fear. "But Griffiths, or Graham, of
Albany, or Syracuse, or anywhere, knew better. He knew he was not
coming back. And he took all of his belongings with him in that
boat. And all afternoon long, from noon until evening, he searched
for a spot on that lonely lake&mdash;a spot not easily observed
from any point of the shore, as we will show. And as evening fell,
he found it. And walking south through the woods afterwards, with a
new straw hat upon his head, a clean, dry bag in his hand, he
imagined himself to be secure. Clifford Golden was no
more&mdash;Carl Graham was no more&mdash;drowned&mdash;at the
bottom of Big Bittern, along with Roberta Alden. But Clyde
Griffiths was alive and free, and on his way to Twelfth Lake, to
the society he so loved.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, Clyde Griffiths killed Roberta Alden before he put
her in that lake. He beat her on the head and face, and he believed
no eye saw him. But, as her last death cry rang out over the water
of Big Bittern, there was a witness, and before the prosecution has
closed its case, that witness will be here to tell you the
story."</p>

<p>Mason had no eye witness, but he could not resist this
opportunity to throw so disrupting a thought into the opposition
camp.</p>

<p>And decidedly, the result was all that he expected, and more.
For Clyde, who up to this time and particularly since the
thunderbolt of the letter, had been seeking to face it all with an
imperturbable look of patient innocence, now stiffened and then
wilted. A witness! And here to testify! God! Then he, whoever he
was, lurking on the lone shore of the lake, had seen the unintended
blow, had heard her cries&mdash;had seen that he had not sought to
aid her! Had seen him swim to shore and steal away&mdash;maybe had
watched him in the woods as he changed his clothes. God! His hands
now gripped the sides of the chair, and his head went back with a
jerk as if from a powerful blow, for that meant death&mdash;his
sure execution. God! No hope now! His head dropped and he looked as
though he might lapse into a state of coma.</p>

<p>As to Belknap, Mason's revelation at first caused him to drop
the pencil with which he was making notes, then next to stare in a
puzzled and dumbfounded way, since they had no evidence wherewith
to forefend against such a smash as this&mdash;But as instantly
recalling how completely off his guard he must look, recovering.
Could it be that Clyde might have been lying to them, after
all&mdash; that he had killed her intentionally, and before this
unseen witness? If so it might be necessary for them to withdraw
from such a hopeless and unpopular case, after all.</p>

<p>As for Jephson, he was for the moment stunned and flattened. And
through his stern and not easily shakable brain raced such thoughts
as&mdash;was there really a witness?&mdash;has Clyde
lied?&mdash;then the die was cast, for had he not already admitted
to them that he had struck Roberta, and the witness must have seen
that? And so the end of any plea of a change of heart. Who would
believe that, after such testimony as this?</p>

<p>But because of the sheer contentiousness and determination of
his nature, he would not permit himself to be completely baffled by
this smashing announcement. Instead he turned, and after surveying
the flustered and yet self-chastising Belknap and Clyde, commented:
"I don't believe it. He's lying, I think, or bluffing. At any rate,
we'll wait and see. It's a long time between now and our side of
the story. Look at all those witnesses there. And we can
cross-question them by the week, if we want to&mdash;until he's out
of office. Plenty of time to do a lot of things&mdash;find out
about this witness in the meantime. And besides, there's suicide,
or there's the actual thing that happened. We can let Clyde swear
to what did happen&mdash;a cataleptic trance&mdash;no courage to do
it. It's not likely anybody can see that at five hundred feet." And
he smiled grimly. At almost the same time he added, but not for
Clyde's ears: "We might be able to get him off with twenty years at
the worst, don't you think?"</p>

<h3>Chapter 21</h3>

<p>And then witnesses, witnesses, witnesses&mdash;to the number of
one hundred and twenty-seven. And their testimony, particularly
that of the doctors, three guides, the woman who heard Roberta's
last cry, all repeatedly objected to by Jephson and Belknap, for
upon such weakness and demonstrable error as they could point out
depended the plausibility of Clyde's daring defense. And all of
this carrying the case well into November, and after Mason had been
overwhelmingly elected to the judgeship which he had so craved. And
because of the very vigor and strife of the trial, the general
public from coast to coast taking more and more interest. And
obviously, as the days passed and the newspaper writers at the
trial saw it, Clyde was guilty. Yet he, because of the repeated
commands of Jephson, facing each witness who assailed him with calm
and even daring.</p>

<p>"Your name?"</p>

<p>"Titus Alden."</p>

<p>"You are the father of Roberta Alden?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Now, Mr. Alden, just tell the jury how and under what
circumstances it was that your daughter Roberta happened to go to
Lycurgus."</p>

<p>"Objected to. Irrelevant, immaterial, incompetent," snapped
Belknap.</p>

<p>"I'll connect it up," put in Mason, looking up at the judge, who
ruled that Titus might answer subject to a motion to strike out his
testimony if not "connected up."</p>

<p>"She went there to get work," replied Titus.</p>

<p>"And why did she go there to get work?"</p>

<p>Again objection, and the old man allowed to proceed after the
legal formalities had again been complied with.</p>

<p>"Well, the farm we have over there near Biltz hasn't ever paid
so very well, and it's been necessary for the children to help out
and Bobbie being the oldest&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Move to strike out!"</p>

<p>"Strike it out."</p>

<p>"'Bobbie' was the pet name you gave your daughter Roberta, was
it?"</p>

<p>"Objected to," etc., etc. "Exception."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. 'Bobbie' was what we sometimes called her around
there&mdash; just Bobbie."</p>

<p>And Clyde listening intently and enduring without flinching the
stern and accusing stare of this brooding Priam of the farm,
wondering at the revelation of his former sweetheart's pet name. He
had nicknamed her "Bert"; she had never told him that at home she
was called "Bobbie."</p>

<p>And amid a fusillade of objections and arguments and rulings,
Alden continuing, under the leading of Mason, to recite how she had
decided to go to Lycurgus, after receipt of a letter from Grace
Marr, and stop with Mr. and Mrs. Newton. And after securing work
with the Griffiths Company, how little the family had seen of her
until June fifth last, when she had returned to the farm for a rest
and in order to make some clothes.</p>

<p>"No announcement of any plans for marriage?"</p>

<p>"None."</p>

<p>But she had written a number of long letters&mdash;to whom he
did not know at the time. And she had been depressed and sick.
Twice he had seen her crying, although he said nothing, knowing
that she did not want to be noticed. There had been a few telephone
calls from Lycurgus, the last on July fourth or fifth, the day
before she left, he was quite sure.</p>

<p>"And what did she have with her when she left?"</p>

<p>"Her bag and her little trunk."</p>

<p>"And would you recognize the bag that she carried, if you saw
it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Is this the bag?" (A deputy assistant district attorney
carrying forward a bag and placing it on a small stand.)</p>

<p>And Alden, after looking at it and wiping his eyes with the back
of his hand, announcing: "Yes, sir."</p>

<p>And then most dramatically, as Mason intended in connection with
every point in this trial, a deputy assistant carrying in a small
trunk, and Titus Alden and his wife and daughters and sons all
crying at the sight of it. And after being identified by him as
Roberta's, the bag and then the trunk were opened in turn. And the
dresses made by Roberta, some underclothing, shoes, hats, the
toilet set given her by Clyde, pictures of her mother and father
and sister and brothers, an old family cookbook, some spoons and
forks and knives and salt and pepper sets&mdash;all given her by
her grandmother and treasured by her for her married
life&mdash;held up and identified in turn.</p>

<p>All this over Belknap's objection, and on Mason's promise to
"connect it up," which, however, he was unable to do, and the
evidence was accordingly ordered "struck out." But its pathetic
significance by that time deeply impressed on the minds and hearts
of the jurymen. And Belknap's criticism of Mason's tactics merely
resulting in that gentleman bellowing, in an infuriated manner:
"Who's conducting this prosecution, anyhow?" To which Belknap
replied: "The Republican candidate for county judge in this county,
I believe!"&mdash;thus evoking a wave of laughter which caused
Mason to fairly shout: "Your Honor, I protest! This is an unethical
and illegal attempt to inject into this case a political issue
which has nothing to do with it. It is slyly and maliciously
intended to convey to this jury that because I am the Republican
nominee for judge of the county, it is impossible for me to
properly and fairly conduct the prosecution of this case. And I now
demand an apology, and will have it before I proceed one step
further in this case."</p>

<p>Whereupon Justice Oberwaltzer, feeling that a very serious
breach of court etiquette had occurred, proceeded to summon Belknap
and Mason before him, and after listening to placid and polite
interpretations of what was meant, and what was not meant, finally
ordered, on pain of contempt, that neither of them again refer to
the political situation in any way.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Belknap and Jephson congratulating themselves that
in this fashion their mood in regard to Mason's candidacy and his
use of this case to further it had effectively gotten before the
jury and the court.</p>

<p>But more and more witnesses!</p>

<p>Grace Marr now taking the stand, and in a glib and voluble
outpouring describing how and where she had first met
Roberta&mdash;how pure and clean and religious a girl she was, but
how after meeting Clyde on Crum Lake a great change had come over
her. She was more secretive and evasive and given to furnishing all
sorts of false excuses for new and strange adventures&mdash;as, for
instance, going out nights and staying late, and claiming to be
places over Saturday and Sunday where she wasn't&mdash;until
finally, because of criticism which she, Grace Marr, had ventured
to make, she had suddenly left, without giving any address. But
there was a man, and that man was Clyde Griffiths. For having
followed Roberta to her room one evening in September or October of
the year before, she had observed her and Clyde in the distance,
near the Gilpin home. They were standing under some trees and he
had his arm around her.</p>

<p>And thereafter Belknap, at Jephson's suggestion, taking her and
by the slyest type of questioning, trying to discover whether,
before coming to Lycurgus, Roberta was as religious and
conventional as Miss Marr would have it. But Miss Marr, faded and
irritable, insisting that up to the day of her meeting with Clyde
on Crum Lake, Roberta had been the soul of truth and purity, in so
far as she knew.</p>

<p>And next the Newtons swearing to much the same thing.</p>

<p>And then the Gilpins, wife and husband and daughters, each
swearing to what she or he alone saw or heard. Mrs. Gilpin as to
the approximate day of Roberta's moving into her home with one
small trunk and bag&mdash;the identical trunk and bag identified by
Titus. And thereafter seeming to live very much alone until finally
she, feeling sorry for her, had suggested one type of contact and
another, but Roberta invariably refusing. But later, along in late
November, although she had never had the heart to say anything
about it to her because of her sweetness and general sobriety, she
and her two daughters had become aware of the fact that
occasionally, after eleven o'clock, it had seemed as though Roberta
must be entertaining some one in her room, but just whom she could
not say. And again at this point, on cross-examination, Belknap
trying to extract any admissions or impressions which would tend to
make it look as though Roberta was a little less reserved and
puritanical than all the witnesses had thus far painted her, but
failing. Mrs. Gilpin, as well as her husband, was plainly fond of
her and only under pressure from Mason and later Belknap testified
to Clyde's late visits.</p>

<p>And then the elder daughter, Stella, testifying that during the
latter part of October or the first of November, shortly after
Roberta had taken the room, she had passed her and a man, whom she
was now able to identify as Clyde, standing less than a hundred
feet from the house, and noticing that they were evidently
quarreling she had paused to listen. She was not able to
distinguish every word of the conversation, but upon leading
questions from Mason was able to recall that Roberta had protested
that she could not let him come into her room&mdash;"it would not
look right." And he had finally turned upon his heel, leaving
Roberta standing with outstretched arms as if imploring him to
return.</p>

<p>And throughout all this Clyde staring in amazement, for he had
in those days&mdash;in fact throughout his entire contact with
Roberta&mdash; imagined himself unobserved. And decidedly this
confirmed much of what Mason had charged in his opening
address&mdash;that he had willfully and with full knowledge of the
nature of the offense, persuaded Roberta to do what plainly she had
not wanted to do&mdash;a form of testimony that was likely to
prejudice the judge as well as the jury and all these conventional
people of this rural county. And Belknap, realizing this, trying to
confuse this Stella in her identification of Clyde. But only
succeeding in eliciting information that some time in November or
the early part of December, shortly after the above incident, she
had seen Clyde arrive, a box of some kind under his arm, and knock
at Roberta's door and enter, and was then positive that he was the
same young man she had seen that moonlight night quarreling with
Roberta.</p>

<p>And next, Whiggam, and after him Liggett, testifying as to the
dates of arrival of Clyde at the factory, as well as Roberta, and
as to the rule regarding department heads and female help, and, in
so far as they could see, the impeccable surface conduct of both
Clyde and Roberta, neither seeming to look at the other or at any
one else for that matter. (That was Liggett testifying.)</p>

<p>And after them again, others. Mrs. Peyton to testify as to the
character of his room and his social activities in so far as she
was able to observe them. Mrs. Alden to testify that at Christmas
the year before Roberta had confessed to her that her superior at
the factory&mdash;Clyde Griffiths, the nephew of the
owner&mdash;was paying attention to her, but that it had to be kept
secret for the time being. Frank Harriet, Harley Baggott, Tracy
Trumbull and Eddie Sells to testify that during December last Clyde
had been invited here and there and had attended various social
gatherings in Lycurgus. John Lambert, a druggist of Schenectady,
testifying that some time in January he had been applied to by a
youth, who he now identified as the defendant, for some medicine
which would bring about a miscarriage. Orrin Short to testify that
in late January Clyde had asked him if he knew of a doctor who
could aid a young married woman&mdash;according to Clyde's story,
the wife of an employee of Griffiths &amp; Company&mdash;who was
too poor to afford a child, and whose husband, according to Clyde,
had asked him for this information. And next Dr. Glenn, testifying
to Roberta's visit, having previously recalled her from pictures
published in the papers, but adding that professionally he had been
unwilling to do anything for her.</p>

<p>And then C. B. Wilcox, a farmer neighbor of the Aldens,
testifying to having been in the washroom back of the kitchen on or
about June twenty-ninth or thirtieth, on which occasion Roberta
having been called over the long distance telephone from Lycurgus
by a man who gave his name as Baker, he had heard her say to him:
"But, Clyde, I can't wait that long. You know I can't. And I
won't." And her voice had sounded excited and distressed. Mr.
Wilcox was positive as to the name Clyde.</p>

<p>And Ethel Wilcox, a daughter of this same C. B.&mdash;short and
fat and with a lisp&mdash;who swore that on three preceding
occasions, having received long distance requests for Roberta, she
had proceeded to get her. And each time the call was from Lycurgus
from a man named Baker. Also, on one occasion, she had heard her
refer to the caller as Clyde. And once she had heard her say that
"under no circumstances would she wait that long," although what
she meant by that she did not know.</p>

<p>And next Roger Beane, a rural free delivery letter-carrier, who
testified that between June seventh or eighth to July fourth or
fifth, he had received no less than fifteen letters from Roberta
herself or the mail box at the crossroads of the Alden farm, and
that he was positive that most of the letters were addressed to
Clyde Griffiths, care of General Delivery, Lycurgus.</p>

<p>And next Amos Showalter, general delivery clerk at Lycurgus, who
swore that to the best of his recollection, from or between June
seventh or eighth and July fourth or fifth, Clyde, whom he knew by
name, had inquired for and received not less than fifteen or
sixteen letters.</p>

<p>And after him, R. T. Biggen, an oil station manager of Lycurgus,
who swore that on the morning of July sixth, at about eight
o'clock, having gone to Fielding Avenue, which was on the extreme
west of the city, leading on the northern end to a "stop" on the
Lycurgus and Fonda electric line, he had seen Clyde, dressed in a
gray suit and wearing a straw hat and carrying a brown suit-case,
to one side of which was strapped a yellow camera tripod and
something else&mdash;an umbrella it might have been. And knowing in
which direction Clyde lived, he had wondered at his walking, when
at Central Avenue, not so far from his home, he could have boarded
the Fonda-Lycurgus car. And Belknap in his cross-examination
inquiring of this witness how, being one hundred and seventy-five
feet distant, he could swear that it was a tripod that he saw, and
Biggens insisting that it was&mdash;it was bright yellow and wood
and had brass clops and three legs.</p>

<p>And then after him, John W. Troescher, station master at Fonda,
who testified that on the morning of July sixth last (he recalled
it clearly because of certain other things which he listed), he had
sold Roberta Alden a ticket to Utica. He recalled Miss Alden
because of having noted her several times during the preceding
winter. She looked quite tired, almost sick, and carried a brown
bag, something like the brown bag there and then exhibited to him.
Also he recalled the defendant, who also carried a bag. He did not
see him notice or talk to the girl.</p>

<p>And next Quincy B. Dale, conductor of the particular train that
ran from Fonda to Utica. He had noticed, and now recalled, Clyde in
one car toward the rear. He also noticed, and from photographs
later published, had recalled Roberta.</p>

<p>She gave him a friendly smile and he had said that such a bag as
she was carrying seemed rather heavy for her and that he would have
one of the brakemen carry it out for her at Utica, for which she
thanked him. He had seen her descend at Utica and disappear into
the depot. He had not noticed Clyde there.</p>

<p>And then the identification of Roberta's trunk as having been
left in the baggage room at the station at Utica for a number of
days. And after that the guest page of the Renfrew House, of Utica,
for July sixth last, identified by Jerry K. Kernocian, general
manager of said hotel, which showed an entry&mdash;"Clifford Golden
and wife." And the same then and there compared by handwriting
experts with two other registration pages from the Grass Lake and
Big Bittern inns and sworn to as being identically the same
handwriting. And these compared with the card in Roberta's
suit-case, and all received in evidence and carefully examined by
each juror in turn and by Belknap and Jephson, who, however, had
seen all but the card before. And once more a protest on the part
of Belknap as to the unwarranted and illegal and shameful
withholding of evidence on the part of the district attorney. And a
long and bitter wrangle as to that, serving, in fact, to bring to a
close the tenth day of the trial.</p>

<h3>Chapter 22</h3>

<p>And then, on the eleventh day, Frank W. Schaefer, clerk of the
Renfrew House in Utica, recalling the actual arrival of Clyde and
Roberta and their actions; also Clyde's registration for both as
Mr. and Mrs. Clifford Golden, of Syracuse. And then Wallace
Vanderhoff, one of the clerks of the Star Haberdashery in Utica,
with a story of Clyde's actions and general appearance at the time
of his buying a straw hat. And then the conductor of the train
running between Utica and Grass Lake. And the proprietor of the
Grass Lake House. And Blanche Pettingill, a waitress, who swore
that at dinner she overheard Clyde arguing with Roberta as to the
impossibility of getting a marriage license there&mdash;that it
would be better to wait until they reached some other place the
next day&mdash;a bit of particularly damaging testimony, since it
pre-dated by a day the proposed confession which Clyde was supposed
to have made to Roberta, but which Jephson and Belknap afterward
agreed between themselves might easily have had some preliminary
phases. And after her the conductor of the train that carried them
to Gun Lodge. And after him the guide and the driver of the bus,
with his story of Clyde's queer talk about many people being over
there and leaving Roberta's bag while he took his own, and saying
they would be back.</p>

<p>And then, the proprietor of the Inn at Big Bittern; the
boatkeeper; the three men in the woods&mdash;their testimony very
damaging to Clyde's case, since they pictured his terror on
encountering them. And then the story of the finding of the boat
and Roberta's body, and the eventual arrival of Heit and his
finding of the letter in Roberta's coat. A score of witnesses
testifying as to all this. And next the boat captain, the farm
girl, the Cranston chauffeur, the arrival of Clyde at the
Cranstons', and at last (every step accounted for and sworn to) his
arrival at Bear Lake, the pursuit and his capture&mdash;to say
nothing of the various phases of his arrest&mdash;what he
said&mdash;this being most damaging indeed, since it painted Clyde
as false, evasive, and terrified.</p>

<p>But unquestionably, the severest and most damaging testimony
related to the camera and the tripod&mdash;the circumstances
surrounding the finding of them&mdash;and on the weight of this
Mason was counting for a conviction. His one aim first was to
convict Clyde of lying as to his possession of either a tripod or a
camera. And in order to do that he first introduced Earl Newcomb,
who swore that on a certain day, when he, Mason and Heit and all
the others connected with the case were taking Clyde over the area
in which the crime had been committed, he and a certain native, one
Bill Swartz, who was afterwards put on the stand, while poking
about under some fallen logs and bushes, had come across the
tripod, hidden under a log. Also (under the leadership of Mason,
although over the objections of both Belknap and Jephson, which
were invariably overruled), he proceeded to add that Clyde, on
being asked whether he had a camera or this tripod, had denied any
knowledge of it, on hearing which Belknap and Jephson actually
shouted their disapproval.</p>

<p>Immediately following, though eventually ordered stricken from
the records by Justice Oberwaltzer, there was introduced a paper
signed by Heit, Burleigh, Slack, Kraut, Swenk, Sissel, Bill Swartz,
Rufus Forster, county surveyor, and Newcomb, which set forth that
Clyde, on being shown the tripod and asked whether he had one,
"vehemently and repeatedly denied that he had." But in order to
drive the import of this home, Mason immediately adding: "Very
well, your Honor, but I have other witnesses who will swear to
everything that is in that paper and more," and at once calling
"Joseph Frazer! Joseph Frazer!" and then placing on the stand a
dealer in sporting goods, cameras, etc., who proceeded to swear
that some time between May fifteenth and June first, the defendant,
Clyde Griffiths, whom he knew by sight and name, had applied to him
for a camera of a certain size, with tripod attached, and that the
defendant had finally selected a Sank, 3&frac12; by 5&frac12;, for
which he had made arrangements to pay in installments. And after
due examination and consulting certain stock numbers with which the
camera and the tripod and his own book were marked, Mr. Frazer
identifying first the camera now shown him, and immediately after
that the yellow tripod as the one he had sold Clyde.</p>

<p>And Clyde sitting up aghast. Then they had found the camera, as
well as the tripod, after all. And after he had protested so that
he had no camera with him. What would that jury and the judge and
this audience think of his lying about that? Would they be likely
to believe his story of a change of heart after this proof that he
had lied about a meaningless camera? Better to have confessed in
the first place.</p>

<p>But even as he was so thinking Mason calling Simeon Dodge, a
young woodsman and driver, who testified that on Saturday, the
sixteenth of July, accompanied by John Pole, who had lifted
Roberta's body out of the water, he had at the request of the
district attorney, repeatedly dived into the exact spot where her
body was found, and finally succeeded in bringing up a camera. And
then the camera itself identified by Dodge.</p>

<p>Immediately after this all the testimony in regard to the
hitherto as yet unmentioned films found in the camera at the time
of its recovery, since developed, and now received in evidence,
four views which showed a person looking more like Roberta than any
one else, together with two, which clearly enough represented
Clyde. Belknap was not able to refute or exclude them.</p>

<p>Then Floyd Thurston, one of the guests at the Cranston lodge at
Sharon on June eighteenth&mdash;the occasion of Clyde's first visit
there&mdash;placed on the stand to testify that on that occasion
Clyde had made a number of pictures with a camera about the size
and description of the one shown him, but failing to identify it as
the particular one, his testimony being stricken out.</p>

<p>After him again, Edna Patterson, a chambermaid in the Grass Lake
Inn, who, as she swore, on entering the room which Clyde and
Roberta occupied on the night of July seventh, had seen Clyde with
a camera in his hand, which was of the size and color, as far as
she could recall, of the one then and there before her. She had
also at the same time seen a tripod. And Clyde, in his curious and
meditative and half-hypnotized state, recalling well enough the
entrance of this girl into that room and marveling and suffering
because of the unbreakable chain of facts that could thus be built
up by witnesses from such varying and unconnected and unexpected
places, and so long after, too.</p>

<p>After her, but on different days, and with Belknap and Jephson
contending every inch of the way as to the admissibility of all
this, the testimony of the five doctors whom Mason had called in at
the time Roberta's body was first brought to Bridgeburg, and who in
turn swore that the wounds, both on the face and head, were
sufficient, considering Roberta's physical condition, to stun her.
And because of the condition of the dead girl's lungs, which had
been tested by attempting to float them in water, averring that at
the time her body had first entered the water, she must have been
still alive, although not necessarily conscious. But as to the
nature of the instrument used to make these wounds, they would not
venture to guess, other than to say it must have been blunt. And no
grilling on the part of either Belknap or Jephson could bring them
to admit that the blows could have been of such a light character
as not to stun or render unconscious. The chief injury appeared to
be on the top of the skull, deep enough to have caused a blood
clot, photographs of all of which were put in evidence.</p>

<p>At this psychological point, when both audience and jury were
most painfully and effectively stirred, a number of photographs of
Roberta's face, made at the time that Heit, the doctors and the
Lutz Brothers had her in charge, were introduced. Then the
dimensions of the bruises on the right side of her face were shown
to correspond exactly in size with two sides of the camera.
Immediately after that, Burton Burleigh, placed on the stand to
swear how he had discovered the two strands of hair which
corresponded with the hair on Roberta's head&mdash;or so Mason
tried to show&mdash;caught between the lens and the lid. And then,
after hours and hours, Belknap, infuriated and yet made nervous by
this type of evidence and seeking to riddle it with sarcasm,
finally pulling a light hair out of his head and then asking the
jurors and Burleigh if they could venture to tell whether one
single hair from any one's head could be an indication of the
general color of a person's hair, and if not, whether they were
ready to believe that this particular hair was from Roberta's head
or not.</p>

<p>Mason then calling a Mrs. Rutger Donahue, who proceeded, in the
calmest and most placid fashion, to tell how on the evening of July
eighth last, between five-thirty and six, she and her husband
immediately after setting up a tent above Moon Cove, had started
out to row and fish, when being about a half-mile off shore and
perhaps a quarter of a mile above the woods or northern fringe of
land which enclosed Moon Cove, she had heard a cry.</p>

<p>"Between half past five and six in the afternoon, you say?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"And on what date again?"</p>

<p>"July eighth."</p>

<p>"And where were you exactly at that time?"</p>

<p>"We were&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not 'we.' Where were you personally?"</p>

<p>"I was crossing what I have since learned was South Bay in a
row-boat with my husband."</p>

<p>"Yes. Now tell what happened next."</p>

<p>"When we reached the middle of the bay I heard a cry."</p>

<p>"What was it like?"</p>

<p>"It was penetrating&mdash;like the cry of some one in
pain&mdash;or in danger. It was sharp&mdash;a haunting cry."</p>

<p>Here a motion to "strike out," with the result that the last
phrase was so ordered stricken out.</p>

<p>"Where did it come from?"</p>

<p>"From a distance. From within or beyond the woods."</p>

<p>"Did you know at the time that there was another bay or cove
there&mdash; below that strip of woods?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, what did you think then&mdash;that it might have come
from within the woods below where you were?"</p>

<p>(Objected to&mdash;and objection sustained.)</p>

<p>"And now tell us, was it a man's or a woman's cry? What kind of
a cry was it?"</p>

<p>"It was a woman's cry, and something like 'Oh, oh!' or 'Oh,
my!'&mdash; very piercing and clear, but distant, of course. A
double scream such as one might make when in pain."</p>

<p>"You are sure you could not be mistaken as to the kind of a cry
it was&mdash;male or female."</p>

<p>"No, sir. I am positive. It was a woman's. It was pitched too
high for a man's voice or a boy's. It could not have been anything
but a woman's."</p>

<p>"I see. And now tell us, Mrs. Donahue&mdash;you see this dot on
the map showing where the body of Roberta Alden was found?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"And you see this other dot, over those trees, showing
approximately where your boat was?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Do you think that voice came from where this dot in Moon Cove
is?"</p>

<p>(Objected to. Sustained.)</p>

<p>"And was that cry repeated?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. I waited, and I called my husband's attention to it,
too, and we waited, but didn't hear it again."</p>

<p>Then Belknap, eager to prove that it might have been a terrified
and yet not a pained or injured cry, taking her and going all over
the ground again, and finding that neither she nor her husband, who
was also put on the stand, could be shaken in any way. Neither,
they insisted, could the deep and sad effect of this woman's voice
be eradicated from their minds. It had haunted both, and once in
their camp again they had talked about it. Because it was dusk he
did not wish to go seeking after the spot from which it came;
because she felt that some woman or girl might have been slain in
those woods, she did not want to stay any longer, and the next
morning early they had moved on to another lake.</p>

<p>Thomas Barrett, another Adirondack guide, connected with a camp
at Dam's Lake, swore that at the time referred to by Mrs. Donahue,
he was walking along the shore toward Big Bittern Inn and had seen
not only a man and woman off shore in about the position described,
but farther back, toward the south shore of this bay, had noted the
tent of these campers. Also that from no point outside Moon Cove,
unless near the entrance, could one observe any boat within the
cove. The entrance was narrow and any view from the lake proper
completely blocked. And there were other witnesses to prove
this.</p>

<p>At this psychological moment, as the afternoon sun was already
beginning to wane in the tall, narrow courtroom, and as carefully
planned by him beforehand, Mason's reading all of Roberta's
letters, one by one, in a most simple and nondeclamatory fashion,
yet with all the sympathy and emotion which their first perusal had
stirred in him. They had made him cry.</p>

<p>He began with letter number one, dated June eighth, only three
days after her departure from Lycurgus, and on through them all
down to letters fourteen, fifteen, sixteen and seventeen, in which,
in piecemeal or by important references here and there, she related
her whole contact with Clyde down to his plan to come for her in
three weeks, then in a month, then on July eighth or ninth, and
then the sudden threat from her which precipitated his sudden
decision to meet her at Fonda. And as Mason read them, all most
movingly, the moist eyes and the handkerchiefs and the coughs in
the audience and among the jurors attested their import:</p>

<blockquote>"You said I was not to worry or think so much about how
I feel, and have a good time. That's all right for you to say, when
you're in Lycurgus and surrounded by your friends and invited
everywhere. It's hard for me to talk over there at Wilcox's with
somebody always in earshot and with you constantly reminding me
that I mustn't say this or that. But I had so much to ask and no
chance there. And all that you would say was that everything was
all right. But you didn't say positively that you were coming on
the 27th, that because of something I couldn't quite make
out&mdash;there was so much buzzing on the wire&mdash;you might not
be able to start until later. But that can't be, Clyde. My parents
are leaving for Hamilton where my uncle lives on the third. And Tom
and Emily are going to my sister's on the same day. But I can't and
won't go there again. I can't stay here all alone. So you must, you
really must come, as you agreed. I can't wait any longer than that,
Clyde, in the condition that I'm in, and so you just must come and
take me away. Oh, please, please, I beg of you, not to torture me
with any more delays now."</blockquote>

<p>And again:</p>

<blockquote>"Clyde, I came home because I thought I could trust
you. You told me so solemnly before I left that if I would, you
would come and get me in three weeks at the most&mdash;that it
would not take you longer than that to get ready, have enough money
for the time we would be together, or until you could get something
to do somewhere else. But yesterday, although the third of July
will be nearly a month since I left, you were not at all sure at
first that you could come by then, and when as I told you my
parents are surely leaving for Hamilton to be gone for ten days. Of
course, afterwards, you said you would come, but you said it as
though you were just trying to quiet me. It has been troubling me
awfully ever since.<br>
<br>
"For I tell you, Clyde, I am sick, very. I feel faint nearly all
the time. And besides, I am so worried as to what I shall do if you
don't come that I am nearly out of my mind."<br>
<br>
"Clyde, I know that you don't care for me any more like you did and
that you are wishing things could be different. And yet, what am I
to do? I know you'll say that it has all been as much my fault as
yours. And the world, if it knew, might think so, too. But how
often did I beg you not to make me do what I did not want to do,
and which I was afraid even then I would regret, although I loved
you too much to let you go, if you still insisted on having your
way."<br>
<br>
"Clyde, if I could only die. That would solve all this. And I have
prayed and prayed that I would lately, yes I have. For life does
not mean as much to me now as when I first met you and you loved
me. Oh, those happy days! If only things were different. If only I
were out of your way. It would all be so much better for me and for
all of us. But I can't now, Clyde, without a penny and no way to
save the name of our child, except this. Yet if it weren't for the
terrible pain and disgrace it would bring to my mother and father
and all my family, I would be willing to end it all in another way.
I truly would."</blockquote>

<p>And again:</p>

<blockquote>"Oh, Clyde, Clyde, life is so different to-day to what
it was last year. Think&mdash;then we were going to Crum and those
other lakes over near Fonda and Gloversville and Little Falls, but
now&mdash;now. Only just now some boy and girl friends of Tom's and
Emily's came by to get them to go after strawberries, and when I
saw them go and knew I couldn't, and that I couldn't be like that
any more ever, I cried and cried, ever so long."</blockquote>

<p>And finally:</p>

<blockquote>"I have been bidding good-by to some places to-day.
There are so many nooks, dear, and all of them so dear to me. I
have lived here all my life, you know. First, there was the
springhouse with its great masses of green moss, and in passing it
I said good-by to it, for I won't be coming to it soon
again&mdash;maybe never. And then the old apple tree where we had
our playhouse years ago&mdash;Emily and Tom and Gifford and I. Then
the 'Believe,' a cute little house in the orchard where we
sometimes played.<br>
<br>
"Oh, Clyde, you can't realize what all this means to me, I feel as
though I shall never see my home again after I leave here this
time. And mamma, poor dear mamma, how I do love her and how sorry I
am to have deceived her so. She is never cross and she always helps
me so much. Sometimes I think if I could tell her, but I can't. She
has had trouble enough, and I couldn't break her heart like that.
No, if I go away and come back some time, either married or
dead&mdash;it doesn't make so much difference now&mdash;she will
never know, and I will not have caused her any pain, and that means
so much more than life itself to me. So good-by, Clyde, until I do
meet you, as you telephoned. And forgive me all the trouble that I
have caused you.<br>
<br>
"Your sorrowful,<br>
<br>
"ROBERTA."</blockquote>

<p>And at points in the reading, Mason himself crying, and at their
conclusion turning, weary and yet triumphant, a most complete and
indestructible case, as he saw it, having been presented, and
exclaiming: "The People rest." And at that moment, Mrs. Alden, in
court with her husband and Emily, and overwrought, not only by the
long strain of the trial but this particular evidence, uttering a
whimpering yet clear cry and then falling forward in a faint. And
Clyde, in his own overwrought condition, hearing her cry and seeing
her fall, jumping up&mdash;the restraining hand of Jephson
instantly upon him, while bailiffs and others assisted her and
Titus who was beside her from the courtroom. And the audience
almost, if not quite, as moved and incensed against Clyde by that
development as though, then and there, he had committed some
additional crime.</p>

<p>But then, that excitement having passed and it being quite dark,
and the hands of the court clock pointing to five, and all the
court weary, Justice Oberwaltzer signifying his intention of
adjourning for the night.</p>

<p>And at once all the newspaper men and feature writers and
artists rising and whispering to each other that on the morrow the
defense would start, and wondering as to who and where the
witnesses were, also whether Clyde would be permitted to go on the
stand in his own defense in the face of this amazing mass of
evidence against him, or whether his lawyers would content
themselves with some specious argument as to mental and moral
weakness which might end in prison for life&mdash;not less.</p>

<p>And Clyde, hissed and cursed as he left the court, wondering if
on the morrow, and as they had planned this long time since, he
would have the courage to rise and go on the stand&mdash;wondering
if there was not some way, in case no one was looking (he was not
handcuffed as he went to and from the jail) maybe to-morrow night
when all were rising, the crowds moving and these deputies coming
toward him&mdash;if&mdash;well, if he could only run, or walk
easily and quietly and yet, quickly and seemingly unintentionally,
to that stair and then down and out&mdash;to&mdash;well&mdash;to
wherever it went&mdash;that small side door to the main stairs
which before this he had seen from the jail! If he could only get
to some woods somewhere, and then walk and walk, or run and run,
maybe, without stopping, and without eating, for days maybe, until,
well, until he had gotten away&mdash;anywhere. It was a chance, of
course. He might be shot, or tracked with dogs and men, but still
it was a chance, wasn't it?</p>

<p>For this way he had no chance at all. No one anywhere, after all
this, was going to believe him not guilty. And he did not want to
die that way. No, no, not that way!</p>

<p>And so another miserable, black and weary night. And then
another miserable gray and wintry morning.</p>

<h3>Chapter 23</h3>

<p>By eight o'clock the next morning the great city papers were on
the stands with the sprawling headlines, which informed every one
in no uncertain terms:</p>

<blockquote>"PROSECUTION IN GRIFFITHS' CASE CLOSES WITH IMPRESSIVE
DELUGE OF TESTIMONY."<br>
<br>
"MOTIVE AS WELL AS METHOD HAMMERED HOME."<br>
<br>
"DESTRUCTIVE MARKS ON FACE AND HEAD SHOWN TO CORRESPOND WITH ONE
SIDE OF CAMERA."<br>
<br>
"MOTHER OF DEAD GIRL FAINTS AT CLOSE OF DRAMATIC READING OF HER
LETTERS."</blockquote>

<p>And the architectonic way in which Mason had built his case,
together with his striking and dramatic presentation of it, was
sufficient to stir in Belknap and Jephson, as well as Clyde, the
momentary conviction that they had been completely
routed&mdash;that by no conceivable device could they possibly
convince this jury now that Clyde was not a quadruple-dyed
villain.</p>

<p>And all congratulating Mason on the masterly way he had
presented his case. And Clyde, greatly reduced and saddened by the
realization that his mother would be reading all that had
transpired the day before. He must ask Jephson to please wire her
so that she would not believe it. And Frank and Julia and Esta. And
no doubt Sondra reading all this, too, to-day, yet through all
these days, all these black nights, not one word! A reference now
and then in the papers to a Miss X but at no time a single correct
picture of her. That was what a family with money could do for you.
And on this very day his defense would begin and he would have to
go forward as the only witness of any import. Yet asking himself,
<i>how could he</i>? The crowd. Its temper. The nervous strain of
its unbelief and hatred by now. And after Belknap was through with
him, then Mason. It was all right for Belknap and Jephson. They
were in no danger of being tortured, as he was certain of being
tortured.</p>

<p>Yet in the face of all this, and after an hour spent with
Jephson and Belknap in his cell, finding himself back in the
courtroom, under the persistent gaze of this nondescript jury and
the tensely interested audience. And now Belknap rising before the
jury and after solemnly contemplating each one of them,
beginning:</p>

<p>"Gentlemen&mdash;somewhat over three weeks ago you were told by
the district attorney that because of the evidence he was about to
present he would insist that you jurors must find the prisoner at
the bar guilty of the crime of which he stands indicted. It has
been a long and tedious procedure since then. The foolish and
inexperienced, yet in every case innocent and unintentional, acts
of a boy of fifteen or sixteen have been gone into before you
gentlemen as though they were the deeds of a hardened criminal, and
plainly with the intention of prejudicing you against this
defendant, who, with the exception of one misinterpreted accident
in Kansas City&mdash;the most brutally and savagely misinterpreted
accident it has ever been my professional misfortune to
encounter&mdash; can be said to have lived as clean and energetic
and blameless and innocent a life as any boy of his years anywhere.
You have heard him called a man&mdash;a bearded man&mdash;a
criminal and a crime-soaked product of the darkest vomiting of
Hell. And yet he is but twenty-one. And there he sits. And I
venture to say that if by some magic of the spoken word I could at
this moment strip from your eye the substance of all the cruel
thoughts and emotions which have been attributed to him by a
clamorous and mistaken and I might say (if I had not been warned
not to do so), politically biased prosecution, you could no more
see him in the light that you do than you could rise out of that
box and fly through those windows.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen of the jury, I have no doubt that you, as well as the
district attorney and even the audience, have wondered how under
the downpour of such linked and at times almost venomous testimony,
I or my colleague or this defendant could have remained as calm and
collected as we have." (And here he waved with grave
ceremoniousness in the direction of his partner, who was still
waiting his own hour.) "Yet, as you have seen, we have not only
maintained but enjoyed the serenity of those who not only feel but
<i>know</i> that they have the right and just end of any legal
contest. You recall, of course, the words of the Avon
bard&mdash;'Thrice armed is he who hath his quarrel just.'</p>

<p>"In fact, we know, as the prosecution in this case unfortunately
does not, the peculiarly strange and unexpected circumstances by
which this dramatic and most unfortunate death came about. And
before we are through you shall see for yourselves. In the
meantime, let me tell you, gentlemen, that since this case opened I
have believed that even apart from the light we propose to throw on
this disheartening tragedy, you gentlemen are not at all sure that
a brutal or bestial crime can be laid upon the shoulders of this
defendant. You cannot be! For after all, love is love, and the ways
of passion and the destroying emotion of love in either sex are not
those of the ordinary criminal. Only remember, we were once all
boys. And those of you who are grown women were girls, and know
well&mdash;oh, how very well&mdash;the fevers and aches of youth
that have nothing to do with a later practical life. 'Judge not,
lest ye be judged and with whatsoever measure ye mete, it will be
measured unto ye again.'</p>

<p>"We admit the existence and charm and potent love spell of the
mysterious Miss X and her letters, which we have not been able to
introduce here, and their effect on this defendant. We admit his
love for this Miss X, and we propose to show by witnesses of our
own, as well as by analyzing some of the testimony that has been
offered here, that perhaps the sly and lecherous overtures with
which this defendant is supposed to have lured the lovely soul now
so sadly and yet so purely accidentally blotted out, as we shall
show, from the straight and narrow path of morality, were perhaps
no more sly nor lecherous than the proceedings of any youth who
finds the girl of his choice surrounded by those who see life only
in the terms of the strictest and narrowest moral regime. And,
gentlemen, as your own county district attorney has told you,
Roberta Alden loved Clyde Griffiths. At the very opening of this
relationship which has since proved to be a tragedy, this dead girl
was deeply and irrevocably in love with him, just as at the time he
imagined that he was in love with her. And people who are deeply
and earnestly in love with each other are not much concerned with
the opinions of others in regard to themselves. They are in
love&mdash; and that is sufficient!</p>

<p>"But, gentlemen, I am not going to dwell on that phase of the
question so much as on this explanation which we are about to
offer. Why did Clyde Griffiths go to Fonda, or to Utica, or to
Grass Lake, or to Big Bittern, at all? Do you think we have any
reason for or any desire to deny or discolor in any way the fact of
his having done so, or with Roberta Alden either? Or why, after the
suddenness and seeming strangeness and mystery of her death, he
should have chosen to walk away as he did? If you seriously think
so for one fraction of a moment, you are the most hopelessly
deluded and mistaken dozen jurymen it has been our privilege to
argue before in all our twenty-seven years' contact with
juries.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, I have said to you that Clyde Griffiths is not
guilty, and he is not. You may think, perhaps, that we ourselves
must be believing in his guilt. But you are wrong. The peculiarity,
the strangeness of life, is such that oftentimes a man may be
accused of something that he did not do and yet every circumstance
surrounding him at the time seem to indicate that he did do it.
There have been many very pathetic and very terrible instances of
miscarriages of justice through circumstantial evidence alone. Be
sure! Oh, be very sure that no such mistaken judgment based on any
local or religious or moral theory of conduct or bias, because of
presumed irrefutable evidence, is permitted to prejudice you, so
that without meaning to, and with the best and highest-minded
intentions, you yourselves see a crime, or the intention to commit
a crime, when no such crime or any such intention ever truly or
legally existed or lodged in the mind or acts of this defendant.
Oh, be sure! Be very, very sure!"</p>

<p>And here he paused to rest and seemed to give himself over to
deep and even melancholy thought, while Clyde, heartened by this
shrewd and defiant beginning was inclined to take more courage. But
now Belknap was talking again, and he must listen&mdash;not lose a
word of all this that was so heartening.</p>

<p>"When Roberta Alden's body was taken out of the water at Big
Bittern, gentlemen, it was examined by a physician. He declared at
the time that the girl had been drowned. He will be here and
testify and the defendant shall have the benefit of that testimony,
and you must render it to him.</p>

<p>"You were told by the district attorney that Roberta Alden and
Clyde Griffiths were engaged to be married and that she left her
home at Biltz and went forth with him on July sixth last on her
wedding journey. Now, gentlemen, it is so easy to slightly distort
a certain set of circumstances. 'Were engaged to be married' was
how the district attorney emphasized the incidents leading up to
the departure on July sixth. As a matter of fact, not one iota of
any direct evidence exists which shows that Clyde Griffiths was
ever formally engaged to Roberta Alden, or that, except for some
passages in her letters, he agreed to marry her. And those
passages, gentlemen, plainly indicate that it was only under the
stress of moral and material worry, due to her condition&mdash;for
which he was responsible, of course, but which, nevertheless, was
with the consent of both&mdash;a boy of twenty-one and a girl of
twenty-three&mdash;that he agreed to marry her. Is that, I ask you,
an open and proper engagement&mdash;the kind of an engagement you
think of when you think of one at all? Mind you, I am not seeking
to flout or belittle or reflect in any way on this poor, dead girl.
I am simply stating, as a matter of fact and of law, that this boy
was not formally engaged to this dead girl. He had not given her
his word beforehand that he would marry her...Never! There is no
proof. You must give him the benefit of that. And only because of
her condition, for which we admit he was responsible, he came
forward with an agreement to marry her, in case...in case" (and
here he paused and rested on the phrase), "she was not willing to
release him. And since she was not willing to release him, as her
various letters read here show, that agreement, on pain of a public
exposure in Lycurgus, becomes, in the eyes and words of the
district attorney, an engagement, and not only that but a sacred
engagement which no one but a scoundrel and a thief and a murderer
would attempt to sever! But, gentlemen, many engagements, more open
and sacred in the eyes of the law and of religion, have been
broken. Thousands of men and thousands of women have seen their
hearts change, their vows and faith and trust flouted, and have
even carried their wounds into the secret places of their souls, or
gone forth, and gladly, to death at their own hands because of
them. As the district attorney said in his address, it is not new
and it will never be old. Never!</p>

<p>"But it is such a case as this last, I warn you, that you are
now contemplating and are about to pass upon&mdash;a girl who is
the victim of such a change of mood. But that is not a legal,
however great a moral or social crime it may be. And it is only a
curious and almost unbelievably tight and yet utterly misleading
set of circumstances in connection with the death of this girl that
chances to bring this defendant before you at this time. I swear
it. I truly know it to be so. And it can and will be fully
explained to your entire satisfaction before this case is
closed.</p>

<p>"However, in connection with this last statement, there is
another which must be made as a preface to all that is to
follow.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen of the jury, the individual who is on trial here for
his life is a mental as well as a moral coward&mdash;no more and no
less&mdash; not a downright, hardhearted criminal by any means. Not
unlike many men in critical situations, he is a victim of a mental
and moral fear complex. Why, no one as yet has been quite able to
explain. We all have one secret bugbear or fear. And it is these
two qualities, and no others, that have placed him in the dangerous
position in which he now finds himself. It was cowardice,
gentlemen&mdash;fear of a rule of the factory of which his uncle is
the owner, as well as fear of his own word given to the officials
above him, that caused him first to conceal the fact that he was
interested in the pretty country girl who had come to work for him.
And later, to conceal the fact that he was going with her.</p>

<p>"Yet no statutory crime of any kind there. You could not
possibly try a man for that, whatever privately you might think.
And it was cowardice, mental and moral, gentlemen, which prevented
him, after he became convinced that he could no longer endure a
relationship which had once seemed so beautiful, from saying
outright that he could not, and would not continue with her, let
alone marry her. Yet, will you slay a man because he is the victim
of fear? And again, after all, if a man has once and truly decided
that he cannot and will not endure a given woman, or a woman a
man&mdash;that to live with her could only prove
torturesome&mdash;what would you have that person do? Marry her? To
what end? That they may hate and despise and torture each other
forever after? Can you truly say that you agree with that as a
rule, or a method, or a law? Yet, as the defense sees it, a truly
intelligent and fair enough thing, under the circumstances, was
done in this instance. An offer, but without marriage&mdash;and
alas, without avail&mdash;was made. A suggestion for a separate
life, with him working to support her while she dwelt elsewhere.
Her own letters, read only yesterday in this court, indicate
something of the kind. But the oh, so often tragic insistence upon
what in so many cases were best left undone! And then that last,
long, argumentative trip to Utica, Grass Lake, and Big Bittern. And
all to no purpose. Yet with no intention to kill or betray unto
death. Not the slightest. And we will show you why.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, once more I insist that it was cowardice, mental and
moral, and not any plot or plan for any crime of any kind, that
made Clyde Griffiths travel with Roberta Alden under various
aliases to all the places I have just mentioned&mdash;that made him
write 'Mr. and Mrs. Carl Graham,' 'Mr. and Mrs. Clifford
Golden'&mdash; mental and moral fear of the great social mistake as
well as sin that he had committed in pursuing and eventually
allowing himself to fail into this unhallowed relationship with
her&mdash;mental and moral fear or cowardice of what was to
follow.</p>

<p>"And again, it was mental and moral cowardice that prevented him
there at Big Bittern, once the waters of the lake had so
accidentally closed over her, from returning to Big Bittern Inn and
making public her death. Mental and Moral Cowardice&mdash;and
nothing more and nothing less. He was thinking of his wealthy
relatives in Lycurgus, their rule which his presence here on the
lake with this girl would show to have been broken&mdash;of the
suffering and shame and rage of her parents. And besides, there was
Miss X&mdash;the brightest star in the brightest constellation of
all his dreams.</p>

<p>"We admit all that, and we are completely willing to concede
that he was, or must have been, thinking of all these things. The
prosecution charges, and we admit that such is the fact, that he
had been so completely ensnared by this Miss X, and she by him,
that he was willing and eager to forsake this first love who had
given herself to him, for one who, because of her beauty and her
wealth, seemed so much more desirable&mdash;even as to Roberta
Alden he seemed more desirable than others. And if she erred as to
him&mdash;as plainly she did&mdash;might not&mdash;might not he
have erred eventually in his infatuated following of one who in the
ultimate&mdash;who can say?&mdash; might not have cared so much for
him. At any rate, one of his strongest fear thoughts at this time,
as he himself has confessed to us, his counsel, was that if this
Miss X learned that he had been up there with this other girl of
whom she had not even so much as heard, well then, it would mean
the end of her regard for him.</p>

<p>"I know that as you gentlemen view such things, such conduct has
no excuse for being. One may be the victim of an internal conflict
between two illicit moods, yet nevertheless, as the law and the
church see it, guilty of sin and crime. But the truth,
none-the-less, is that they do exist in the human heart, law or no
law, religion or no religion, and in scores of cases they motivate
the actions of the victims. And we admit that they motivated the
actions of Clyde Griffiths.</p>

<p>"But did he kill Roberta Alden?</p>

<p>"No!</p>

<p>"And again, no!</p>

<p>"Or did he plot in any way, half-heartedly or otherwise, to drag
her up there under the guise of various aliases and then, because
she would not set him free, drown her? Ridiculous! Impossible!
Insane! His plan was completely and entirely different.</p>

<p>"But, gentlemen," and here he suddenly paused as though a new or
overlooked thought had just come to him, "perhaps you would be
better satisfied with my argument and the final judgment you are to
render if you were to have the testimony of one eye-witness at
least of Roberta Alden's death&mdash;one who, instead of just
hearing a voice, was actually present, and who saw and hence knows
how she met her death."</p>

<p>He now looked at Jephson as much as to say: Now, Reuben, at
last, here we are! And Reuben, turning to Clyde, easily and yet
with iron in his every motion, whispered: "Well, here we are,
Clyde, it's up to you now. Only I'm going along with you, see? I've
decided to examine you myself. I've drilled and drilled you, and I
guess you won't have any trouble in telling me, will you?" He
beamed on Clyde genially and encouragingly, and Clyde, because of
Belknap's strong plea as well as this newest and best development
in connection with Jephson, now stood up and with almost a jaunty
air, and one out of all proportion to his mood of but four hours
before, now whispered: "Gee! I'm glad you're going to do it. I'll
be all right now, I think."</p>

<p>But in the meantime the audience, hearing that an actual
eye-witness was to be produced, and not by the prosecution but the
defense, was at once upon its feet, craning and stirring. And
Justice Oberwaltzer, irritated to an exceptional degree by the
informality characteristic of this trial, was now rapping with his
gavel while his clerk cried loudly: "Order! Order! Unless everybody
is seated, all spectators will be dismissed! The deputies will
please see that all are seated." And then a hushed and strained
silence falling as Belknap called: "Clyde Griffiths, take the
witness chair." And the audience&mdash;seeing to its astonishment,
Clyde, accompanied by Reuben Jephson, making his way
forward&mdash;straining and whispering in spite of all the gruff
commands of the judge and the bailiffs. And even Belknap, as he saw
Jephson approaching, being a little astonished, since it was he who
according to the original plan was to have led Clyde through his
testimony. But now Jephson drawing near to him as Clyde was being
seated and sworn, merely whispered: "Leave him to me, Alvin, I
think it's best. He looks a little too strained and shaky to suit
me, but I feel sure I can pull him through."</p>

<p>And then the audience noting the change and whispering in regard
to it. And Clyde, his large nervous eyes turning here and there,
thinking: Well, I'm on the witness stand at last. And now
everybody's watching me, of course. I must look very calm, like I
didn't care so very much, because I didn't really kill her. That's
right, I didn't. Yet his skin blue and the lids of his eyes red and
puffy and his hands trembling slightly in spite of himself. And
Jephson, his long, tensile and dynamic body like that of a swaying
birch, turning toward him and looking fixedly into Clyde's brown
eyes with his blue ones, beginning:</p>

<p>"Now, Clyde, the first thing we want to do is make sure that the
jury and every one else hears our questions and answers. And next,
when you're all set, you're going to begin with your life as you
remember it&mdash;where you were born, where you came from, what
your father did and your mother, too, and finally, what you did and
why, from the time you went to work until now. I may interrupt you
with a few questions now and then, but in the main I'm going to let
you tell it, because I know you can tell it better than any one."
Yet in order to reassure Clyde and to make him know each moment
that he was there&mdash;a wall, a bulwark, between him and the
eager, straining, unbelieving and hating crowd&mdash;he now drew
nearer, at times so close as to put one foot on the witness stand,
or if not that to lean forward and lay a hand on the arm of the
chair in which Clyde sat. And all the while saying,
"Yay-uss&mdash;Yay-uss." "And then what?" "And then?" And
invariably at the strong and tonic or protective sound of his voice
Clyde stirring as with a bolstering force and finding himself able,
and without shaking or quavering, to tell the short but straitened
story of his youth.</p>

<p>"I was born in Grand Rapids, Michigan. My parents were
conducting a mission there at that time and used to hold open air
meetings..."</p>

<h3>Chapter 24</h3>

<p>Clyde's testimony proceeded to the point where the family had
removed from Quincy, Illinois (a place resorted to on account of
some Salvation Army work offered his father and mother), to Kansas
City, where from his twelfth to his fifteenth year he had browsed
about trying to find something to do while still resenting the
combination of school and religious work expected of him.</p>

<p>"Were you up with your classes in the public schools?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. We had moved too much."</p>

<p>"In what grade were you when you were twelve years old?"</p>

<p>"Well, I should have been in the seventh but I was only in the
sixth. That's why I didn't like it."</p>

<p>"And how about the religious work of your parents?"</p>

<p>"Well, it was all right&mdash;only I never did like going out
nights on the street corners."</p>

<p>And so on, through five-and-ten cent store, soda and newspaper
carrier jobs, until at last he was a bell-hop at the
Green-Davidson, the finest hotel in Kansas City, as he informed
them.</p>

<p>"But now, Clyde," proceeded Jephson who, fearful lest Mason on
the cross-examination and in connection with Clyde's credibility as
a witness should delve into the matter of the wrecked car and the
slain child in Kansas City and so mar the effect of the story he
was now about to tell, was determined to be beforehand in this.
Decidedly, by questioning him properly he could explain and soften
all that, whereas if left to Mason it could be tortured into
something exceedingly dark indeed. And so now he continued:</p>

<p>"And how long did you work there?"</p>

<p>"A little over a year."</p>

<p>"And why did you leave?"</p>

<p>"Well, it was on account of an accident."</p>

<p>"What kind of an accident?"</p>

<p>And here Clyde, previously prepared and drilled as to all this
plunged into the details which led up to and included the death of
the little girl and his flight&mdash;which Mason, true enough, had
been intending to bring up. But, now, as he listened to all this,
he merely shook his head and grunted ironically, "He'd better go
into all that," he commented. And Jephson, sensing the import of
what he was doing&mdash;how most likely he was, as he would have
phrased it, "spiking" one of Mr. Mason's best guns, continued
with:</p>

<p>"How old were you then, Clyde, did you say?"</p>

<p>"Between seventeen and eighteen."</p>

<p>"And do you mean to tell me," he continued, after he had
finished with all of the questions he could think of in connection
with all this, "that you didn't know that you might have gone back
there, since you were not the one who took the car, and after
explaining it all, been paroled in the custody of your
parents?"</p>

<p>"Object!" shouted Mason. "There's no evidence here to show that
he could have returned to Kansas City and been paroled in the
custody of his parents."</p>

<p>"Objection sustained!" boomed the judge from his high throne.
"The defense will please confine itself a little more closely to
the letter of the testimony."</p>

<p>"Exception," noted Belknap, from his seat.</p>

<p>"No, sir. I didn't know that," replied Clyde, just the same.</p>

<p>"Anyhow was that the reason after you got away that you changed
your name to Tenet as you told me?" continued Jephson.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"By the way, just where did you get that name of Tenet,
Clyde?"</p>

<p>"It was the name of a boy I used to play with in Quincy."</p>

<p>"Was he a good boy?"</p>

<p>"Object!" called Mason, from his chair. "Incompetent,
immaterial, irrelevant."</p>

<p>"Oh, he might have associated with a good boy in spite of what
you would like to have the jury believe, and in that sense it is
very relevant," sneered Jephson.</p>

<p>"Objection sustained!" boomed Justice Oberwaltzer.</p>

<p>"But didn't it occur to you at the time that he might object or
that you might be doing him an injustice in using his name to cover
the identity of a fellow who was running away?"</p>

<p>"No, sir&mdash;I thought there were lots of Tenets."</p>

<p>An indulgent smile might have been expected at this point, but
so antagonistic and bitter was the general public toward Clyde that
such levity was out of the question in this courtroom.</p>

<p>"Now listen, Clyde," continued Jephson, having, as he had just
seen, failed to soften the mood of the throng, "you cared for your
mother, did you?&mdash;or didn't you?"</p>

<p>Objection and argument finally ending in the question being
allowed.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, certainly I cared for her," replied Clyde&mdash;but
after a slight hesitancy which was noticeable&mdash;a tightening of
the throat and a swelling and sinking of the chest as he exhaled
and inhaled.</p>

<p>"Much?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir&mdash;much." He didn't venture to look at any one
now.</p>

<p>"Hadn't she always done as much as she could for you, in her
way?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, then, Clyde, how was it, after all that, and even though
that dreadful accident had occurred, you could run away and stay
away so long without so much as one word to tell her that you were
by no means as guilty as you seemed and that she shouldn't worry
because you were working and trying to be a good boy again?"</p>

<p>"But I did write her&mdash;only I didn't sign my name."</p>

<p>"I see. Anything else?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. I sent her a little money. Ten dollars once."</p>

<p>"But you didn't think of going back at all?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. I was afraid that if I went back they might arrest
me."</p>

<p>"In other words," and here Jephson emphasized this with great
clearness, "you were a moral and mental coward, as Mr. Belknap, my
colleague, said."</p>

<p>"I object to this interpretation of this defendant's testimony
for the benefit of the jury!" interrupted Mason.</p>

<p>"This defendant's testimony really needs no interpretation. It
is very plain and honest, as any one can see," quickly interjected
Jephson.</p>

<p>"Objection sustained!" called the judge. "Proceed. Proceed."</p>

<p>"And it was because you were a moral and mental coward as I see
it, Clyde&mdash;not that I am condemning you for anything that you
cannot help. (After all, you didn't make yourself, did you?)"</p>

<p>But this was too much, and the judge here cautioned him to use
more discretion in framing his future questions.</p>

<p>"Then you went about in Alton, Peoria, Bloomington, Milwaukee,
and Chicago&mdash;hiding away in small rooms in back streets and
working as a dishwasher or soda fountain man, or a driver, and
changing your name to Tenet when you really might have gone back to
Kansas City and resumed your old place?" continued Jephson.</p>

<p>"I object! I object!" yelled Mason. "There is no evidence here
to show that he could have gone there and resumed his old
place."</p>

<p>"Objection sustained," ruled Oberwaltzer, although at the time
in Jephson's pocket was a letter from Francis X. Squires, formerly
captain of the bell-hops of the Green-Davidson at the time Clyde
was there, in which he explained that apart from the one incident
in connection with the purloined automobile, he knew nothing
derogatory to Clyde; and that always previously, he had found him
prompt, honest, willing, alert and well-mannered. Also that at the
time the accident occurred, he himself had been satisfied that
Clyde could have been little else than one of those led and that if
he had returned and properly explained matters he would have been
reinstated. It was irrelevant.</p>

<p>Thereafter followed Clyde's story of how, having fled from the
difficulties threatening him in Kansas City and having wandered
here and there for two years, he had finally obtained a place in
Chicago as a driver and later as a bell-boy at the Union League,
and also how while still employed at the first of these places he
had written his mother and later at her request was about to write
his uncle, when, accidentally meeting him at the Union League, he
was invited by him to come to Lycurgus. And thereupon, in their
natural order, followed all of the details, of how he had gone to
work, been promoted and instructed by his cousin and the foreman as
to the various rules, and then later how he had met Roberta and
still later Miss X. But in between came all the details as to how
and why he had courted Roberta Alden, and how and why, having once
secured her love he felt and thought himself content&mdash;but how
the arrival of Miss X, and her overpowering fascination for him,
had served completely to change all his notions in regard to
Roberta, and although he still admired her, caused him to feel that
never again as before could he desire to marry her.</p>

<p>But Jephson, anxious to divert the attention of the jury from
the fact that Clyde was so very fickle&mdash;a fact too trying to
be so speedily introduced into the case&mdash;at once interposed
with:</p>

<p>"Clyde! You really loved Roberta Alden at first, didn't
you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, then, you must have known, or at least you gathered from
her actions, from the first, didn't you, that she was a perfectly
good and innocent and religious girl."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, that's how I felt about her," replied Clyde,
repeating what he had been told to say.</p>

<p>"Well, then, just roughly now, without going into detail, do you
suppose you could explain to yourself and this jury how and why and
where and when those changes came about which led to that
relationship which we all of us" (and here he looked boldly and
wisely and coldly out over the audience and then afterwards upon
the jurors) "deplore. How was it, if you thought so highly of her
at first that you could so soon afterwards descend to this evil
relationship? Didn't you know that all men, and all women also,
view it as wrong, and outside of marriage unforgivable&mdash;a
statutory crime?"</p>

<p>The boldness and ironic sting of this was sufficient to cause at
first a hush, later a slight nervous tremor on the part of the
audience which, Mason as well as Justice Oberwaltzer noting, caused
both to frown apprehensively. Why, this brazen young cynic! How
dared he, via innuendo and in the guise of serious questioning,
intrude such a thought as this, which by implication at least
picked at the very foundations of society&mdash;religious and
moral! At the same time there he was, standing boldly and
leoninely, the while Clyde replied:</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I suppose I did&mdash;certainly&mdash;but I didn't
try to seduce her at first or at any time, really. I was in love
with her."</p>

<p>"You were in love with her?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Very much?"</p>

<p>"Very much."</p>

<p>"And was she as much in love with you at that time?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, she was."</p>

<p>"From the very first?"</p>

<p>"From the very first."</p>

<p>"She told you so?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"At the time she left the Newtons&mdash;you have heard all the
testimony here in regard to that&mdash;did you induce or seek to
induce her in any way, by any trick or agreement, to leave
there?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, I didn't. She wanted to leave there of her own accord.
She wanted me to help her find a place."</p>

<p>"She wanted you to help her find a place?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"And just why?"</p>

<p>"Because she didn't know the city very well and she thought
maybe I could tell her where there was a nice room she could
get&mdash;one that she could afford."</p>

<p>"And did you tell her about the room she took at the
Gilpins'?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, I didn't. I never told her about any room. She found
it herself." (This was the exact answer he had memorized.)</p>

<p>"But why didn't you help her?"</p>

<p>"Because I was busy, days and most evenings. And besides I
thought she knew better what she wanted than I did&mdash;the kind
of people and all."</p>

<p>"Did you personally ever see the Gilpin place before she went
there?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"Ever have any discussion with her before she moved there as to
the kind of a room she was to take&mdash;its position as regards to
entrance, exit, privacy, or anything of that sort?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, I never did."</p>

<p>"Never insisted, for instance, that she take a certain type of
room which you could slip in and out of at night or by day without
being seen?"</p>

<p>"I never did. Besides, no one could very well slip in or out of
that house without being seen."</p>

<p>"And why not?"</p>

<p>"Because the door to her room was right next to the door to the
general front entrance where everybody went in and out and anybody
that was around could see." That was another answer he had
memorized.</p>

<p>"But you slipped in and out, didn't you?"</p>

<p>"Well, yes, sir&mdash;that is, we both decided from the first
that the less we were seen together anywhere, the better."</p>

<p>"On account of that factory rule?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir&mdash;on account of that factory rule."</p>

<p>And then the story of his various difficulties with Roberta, due
to Miss X coming into his life.</p>

<p>"Now, Clyde, we will have to go into the matter of this Miss X a
little. Because of an agreement between the defense and the
prosecution which you gentlemen of the jury fully understand, we
can only touch on this incidentally, since it all concerns an
entirely innocent person whose real name can be of no service here
anyhow. But some of the facts must be touched upon, although we
will deal with them as light as possible, as much for the sake of
the innocent living as the worthy dead. And I am sure Miss Alden
would have it so if she were alive. But now in regard to Miss X,"
he continued, turning to Clyde, "it is already agreed by both sides
that you met her in Lycurgus some time in November or December of
last year. That is correct, is it not?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, that is correct," replied Clyde, sadly.</p>

<p>"And that at once you fell very much in love with her?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. That's true."</p>

<p>"She was rich?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Beautiful?</p>

<p>"I believe it is admitted by all that she is," he said to the
court in general without requiring or anticipating a reply from
Clyde, yet the latter, so thoroughly drilled had he been, now
replied: "Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Had you two&mdash;yourself and Miss Alden, I mean&mdash;at that
time when you first met Miss X already established that illicit
relationship referred to?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, now, in view of all that&mdash;but no, one moment, there
is something else I want to ask you first&mdash;now, let me
see&mdash;at the time that you first met this Miss X you were still
in love with Roberta Alden, were you&mdash;or were you not?"</p>

<p>"I was still in love with her&mdash;yes, sir."</p>

<p>"You had not, up to that time at least, in any way become weary
of her? Or had you?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. I had not."</p>

<p>"Her love and her companionship were just as precious and
delightful to you as ever?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, they were."</p>

<p>And as Clyde said that, he was thinking back and it seemed to
him that what he had just said was really true. It was true that
just before meeting Sondra he was actually at the zenith of content
and delight with Roberta.</p>

<p>"And what, if any, were your plans for your future with Miss
Alden&mdash; before you met this Miss X? You must have thought at
times of that, didn't you?"</p>

<p>"Well, not exactly," (and as he said this he licked his lips in
sheer nervousness). "You see, I never had any real plan to do
anything&mdash;that is, to do anything that wasn't quite right with
her. And neither did she, of course. We just drifted kinda, from
the first. It was being alone there so much, maybe. She hadn't
taken up with anybody yet and I hadn't either. And then there was
that rule that kept me from taking her about anywhere, and once we
were together, of course we just went on without thinking very much
about it, I suppose&mdash;either of us."</p>

<p>"You just drifted because nothing had happened as yet and you
didn't suppose anything would. Is that the way?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. I mean, yes, sir. That's the way it was." Clyde was
very eager to get those much-rehearsed and very important answers,
just right.</p>

<p>"But you must have thought of something&mdash;one or both of
you. You were twenty-one and she was twenty-three."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. I suppose we did&mdash;I suppose I did think of
something now and then."</p>

<p>"And what was it that you thought? Can you recollect?"</p>

<p>"Well, yes, sir. I suppose I can. That is, I know that I did
think at times that if things went all right and I made a little
more money and she got a place somewhere else, that I would begin
taking her out openly, and then afterwards maybe, if she and I kept
on caring for each other as we did then, marry her, maybe."</p>

<p>"You actually thought of marrying her then, did you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. I know I did in the way that I've said, of
course."</p>

<p>"But that was before you met this Miss X?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, that was before that."</p>

<p>("Beautifully done!" observed Mason, sarcastically, under his
breath to State Senator Redmond. "Excellent stage play," replied
Redmond in a stage whisper.)</p>

<p>"But did you ever tell her in so many words?" continued
Jephson.</p>

<p>"Well, no, sir. I don't recall that I did&mdash;not just in so
many words."</p>

<p>"You either told her or you didn't tell her. Now, which was
it?"</p>

<p>"Well, neither, quite. I used to tell her that I loved her and
that I never wanted her to leave me and that I hoped she never
would."</p>

<p>"But not that you wanted to marry her?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. Not that I wanted to marry her."</p>

<p>"Well, well, all right!&mdash;and she&mdash;what did she
say?"</p>

<p>"That she never would leave me," replied Clyde, heavily and
fearsomely, thinking, as he did so, of Roberta's last cries and her
eyes bent on him. And he took from his pocket a handkerchief and
began to wipe his moist, cold face and hands.</p>

<p>("Well staged!" murmured Mason, softly and cynically. "Pretty
shrewd&mdash;pretty shrewd!" commented Redmond, lightly.)</p>

<p>"But, tell me," went on Jephson, softly and coldly, "feeling as
you did about Miss Alden, how was it that upon meeting this Miss X,
you could change so quickly? Are you so fickle that you don't know
your own mind from day to day?"</p>

<p>"Well, I didn't think so up to that time&mdash;no, sir!"</p>

<p>"Had you ever had a strong and binding love affair at any time
in your life before you met Miss Alden?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"But did you consider this one with Miss Alden strong and
binding&mdash; a true love affair&mdash;up to the time you met this
Miss X?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I did."</p>

<p>"And afterwards&mdash;then what?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;afterwards&mdash;it wasn't quite like that any
more."</p>

<p>"You mean to say that on sight of Miss X, after encountering her
once or twice, you ceased to care for Miss Alden entirely?"</p>

<p>"Well, no, sir. It wasn't quite like that," volunteered Clyde,
swiftly and earnestly. "I did continue to care for her
some&mdash;quite a lot, really. But before I knew it I had
completely lost my head over&mdash;over Miss&mdash;Miss&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, this Miss X. We know. You fell madly and unreasonably in
love with her. Was that the way of it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"And then?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;and then&mdash;I just couldn't care for Miss Alden
so much any more." A thin film of moisture covered Clyde's forehead
and cheeks as he spoke.</p>

<p>"I see! I see!" went on Jephson, oratorically and loudly, having
the jury and audience in mind. "A case of the Arabian Nights, of
the enscorcelled and the enscorcellor."</p>

<p>"I don't think I know what you mean," said Clyde.</p>

<p>"A case of being betwitched, my poor boy&mdash;by beauty, love,
wealth, by things that we sometimes think we want very, very much,
and cannot ever have&mdash;that is what I mean, and that is what
much of the love in the world amounts to."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied Clyde, quite innocently, concluding rightly
that this was mere show of rhetoric on Jephson's part.</p>

<p>"But what I want to know is&mdash;how was it that loving Miss
Alden as much as you say you did&mdash;and having reached that
relationship which should have been sanctified by
marriage&mdash;how was it that you could have felt so little bound
or obligated to her as to entertain the idea of casting her over
for this Miss X? Now just how was that? I would like to know, and
so would this jury, I am sure. Where was your sense of gratitude?
Your sense of moral obligation? Do you mean to say that you have
none? We want to know."</p>

<p>This was really cross-examination&mdash;an attack on his own
witness. Yet Jephson was within his rights and Mason did not
interfere.</p>

<p>"Well..." and here Clyde hesitated and stumbled, quite as if he
had not been instructed as to all this beforehand, and seemed to
and did truly finger about in his own mind or reason for some
thought that would help him to explain all this. For although it
was true that he had memorized the answer, now that he was
confronted by the actual question here in court, as well as the old
problem that had so confused and troubled him in Lycurgus, he could
scarcely think clearly of all he had been told to say, but instead
twisted and turned, and finally came out with:</p>

<p>"The fact is, I didn't think about those things at all very
much. I couldn't after I saw her. I tried to at times, but I
couldn't. I only wanted her and I didn't want Miss Alden any more.
I knew I wasn't doing right&mdash;exactly&mdash;and I felt sorry
for Roberta&mdash;but just the same I didn't seem able to do
anything much about it. I could only think of Miss X and I couldn't
think of Roberta as I had before no matter how hard I tried."</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say that you didn't suffer in your own
conscience on account of this?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I suffered," replied Clyde. "I knew I wasn't doing
right, and it made me worry a lot about her and myself, but just
the same I didn't seem to be able to do any better." (He was
repeating words that Jephson had written out for him, although at
the time he first read them he felt them to be fairly true. He had
suffered some.)</p>

<p>"And then?"</p>

<p>"Well, then she began to complain because I didn't go round to
see her as much as before."</p>

<p>"In other words, you began to neglect her."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, some&mdash;but not entirely&mdash;no, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, when you found you were so infatuated with this Miss X,
what did you do? Did you go and tell Miss Alden that you were no
longer in love with her but in love with some one else?"</p>

<p>"No, I didn't. Not then."</p>

<p>"Why not then? Did you think it fair and honorable to be telling
two girls at once that you cared for them?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, but it wasn't quite like that either. You see at that
time I was just getting acquainted with Miss X, and I wasn't
telling her anything. She wouldn't let me. But I knew then, just
the same, that I couldn't care for Miss Alden any more."</p>

<p>"But what about the claim Miss Alden had on you? Didn't you feel
that that was enough or should be, to prevent you from running
after another girl?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, why did you then?"</p>

<p>"I couldn't resist her."</p>

<p>"Miss X, you mean?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"And so you continued to run after her until you had made her
care for you?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, that wasn't the way at all."</p>

<p>"Well then, what was the way?"</p>

<p>"I just met her here and there and got crazy about her."</p>

<p>"I see. But still you didn't go and tell Miss Alden that you
couldn't care for her any longer?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. Not then."</p>

<p>"And why not?"</p>

<p>"Because I thought it would hurt her, and I didn't want to do
that."</p>

<p>"Oh, I see. You didn't have the moral or mental courage to do it
then?"</p>

<p>"I don't know about the moral or mental courage," replied Clyde,
a little hurt and irritated by this description of himself, "but I
felt sorry for her just the same. She used to cry and I didn't have
the heart to tell her anything."</p>

<p>"I see. Well, let it stand that way, if you want to. But now
answer me one other thing. That relationship between you
two&mdash;what about that&mdash;after you knew that you didn't care
for her any more. Did that continue?"</p>

<p>"Well, no, sir, not so very long, anyhow," replied Clyde, most
nervously and shamefacedly. He was thinking of all the people
before him now&mdash;of his mother&mdash;Sondra&mdash;of all the
people throughout the entire United States&mdash;who would read and
so know. And on first being shown these questions weeks and weeks
before he had wanted to know of Jephson what the use of all that
was. And Jephson had replied: "Educational effect. The quicker and
harder we can shock 'em with some of the real facts of life around
here, the easier it is going to be for you to get a little more
sane consideration of what your problem was. But don't worry your
head over that now. When the time comes, just answer 'em and leave
the rest to us. We know what we're doing." And so now Clyde
added:</p>

<p>"You see, after meeting Miss X I couldn't care for her so much
that way any more, and so I tried not to go around her so much any
more. But anyhow, it wasn't so very long after that before she got
in trouble and then&mdash;well&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I see. And when was that&mdash;about?"</p>

<p>"Along in the latter part of January last year."</p>

<p>"And once that happened, then what? Did you or did you not feel
that it was your duty under the circumstances to marry her?"</p>

<p>"Well, no&mdash;not the way things were then&mdash;that is, if I
could get her out of it, I mean."</p>

<p>"And why not? What do you mean by 'as things were then'?"</p>

<p>"Well, you see, it was just as I told you. I wasn't caring for
her any more, and since I hadn't promised to marry her, and she
knew it, I thought it would be fair enough if I helped her out of
it and then told her that I didn't care for her as I once did."</p>

<p>"But couldn't you help her out of it?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. But I tried."</p>

<p>"You went to that druggist who testified here?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"To anybody else?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir&mdash;to seven others before I could get anything at
all."</p>

<p>"But what you got didn't help?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"Did you go to that young haberdasher who testified here as he
said?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"And did he give you the name of any particular doctor?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;yes&mdash;but I wouldn't care to say which one."</p>

<p>"All right, you needn't. But did you send Miss Alden to any
doctor?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Did she go alone or did you go with her?"</p>

<p>"I went with her&mdash;that is, to the door."</p>

<p>"Why only to the door?"</p>

<p>"Well, we talked it over, and she thought just as I did, that it
might be better that way. I didn't have any too much money at the
time. I thought he might be willing to help her for less if she
went by herself than if we both went together."</p>

<p>("I'll be damned if he isn't stealing most of my thunder,"
thought Mason to himself at this point. "He's forestalling most of
the things I intended to riddle him with." And he sat up worried.
Burleigh and Redmond and Earl Newcomb&mdash;all now saw clearly
what Jephson was attempting to do.)</p>

<p>"I see. And it wasn't by any chance because you were afraid that
your uncle or Miss X might hear of it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I...that is, we both thought of that and talked of it.
She understood how things were with me down there."</p>

<p>"But not about Miss X?"</p>

<p>"No, not about Miss X."</p>

<p>"And why not?"</p>

<p>"Well, because I didn't think I could very well tell her just
then. It would have made her feel too bad. I wanted to wait until
she was all right again."</p>

<p>"And then tell her and leave her. Is that what you mean?"</p>

<p>"Well, yes, if I still couldn't care for her any more&mdash;yes,
sir."</p>

<p>"But not if she was in trouble?"</p>

<p>"Well, no, sir, not if she was in trouble. But you see, at that
time I was expecting to be able to get her out of that."</p>

<p>"I see. But didn't her condition affect your attitude toward
her&mdash; cause you to want to straighten the whole thing out by
giving up this Miss X and marrying Miss Alden?"</p>

<p>"Well, no, sir&mdash;not then exactly&mdash;that is, not at that
time."</p>

<p>"How do you mean&mdash;'not at that time'?"</p>

<p>"Well, I did come to feel that way later, as I told
you&mdash;but not then&mdash;that was afterwards&mdash;after we
started on our trip to the Adirondacks&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And why not then?"</p>

<p>"I've said why. I was too crazy about Miss X to think of
anything but her."</p>

<p>"You couldn't change even then?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. I felt sorry, but I couldn't."</p>

<p>"I see. But never mind that now. I will come to that later. Just
now I want to have you explain to the jury, if you can, just what
it was about this Miss X, as contrasted with Miss Alden, that made
her seem so very much more desirable in your eyes. Just what
characteristics of manner or face or mind or position&mdash;or
whatever it was that so enticed you? Or do you know?"</p>

<p>This was a question which both Belknap and Jephson in various
ways and for various reasons&mdash;psychic, legal,
personal&mdash;had asked Clyde before, and with varying results. At
first he could not and would not discuss her at all, fearing that
whatever he said would be seized upon and used in his trial and the
newspapers along with her name. But later, when because of the
silence of the newspapers everywhere in regard to her true name, it
became plain that she was not to be featured, he permitted himself
to talk more freely about her. But now here on the stand, he grew
once more nervous and reticent.</p>

<p>"Well, you see, it's hard to say. She was very beautiful to me.
Much more so than Roberta&mdash;but not only that, she was
different from any one I had ever known&mdash;more
independent&mdash;and everybody paid so much attention to what she
did and what she said. She seemed to know more than any one else I
ever knew. Then she dressed awfully well, and was very rich and in
society and her name and pictures were always in the paper. I used
to read about her every day when I didn't see her, and that seemed
to keep her before me a lot. She was daring, too&mdash;not so
simple or trusting as Miss Alden was&mdash;and at first it was hard
for me to believe that she was becoming so interested in me. It got
so that I couldn't think of any one or anything else, and I didn't
want Roberta any more. I just couldn't, with Miss X always before
me."</p>

<p>"Well, it looks to me as if you might have been in love, or
hypnotized at that," insinuated Jephson at the conclusion of this
statement, the tail of his right eye upon the jury. "If that isn't
a picture of pretty much all gone, I guess I don't know one when I
see it." But with the audience and the jury as stony-faced as
before, as he could see.</p>

<p>But immediately thereafter the swift and troubled waters of the
alleged plot which was the stern trail to which all this was
leading.</p>

<p>"Well, now, Clyde, from there on, just what happened? Tell us
now, as near as you can recall. Don't shade it or try to make
yourself look any better or any worse. She is dead, and you may be,
eventually, if these twelve gentlemen here finally so decide." (And
at this an icy chill seemed to permeate the entire courtroom as
well as Clyde.) "But the truth for the peace of your own soul is
the best,"&mdash;and here Jephson thought of Mason&mdash;let him
counteract that if he can.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said Clyde, simply.</p>

<p>"Well, then, after she got in trouble and you couldn't help her,
then what? What was it you did? How did you act?...By the way, one
moment&mdash;what was your salary at that time?"</p>

<p>"Twenty-five dollars a week," confessed Clyde.</p>

<p>"No other source of income?"</p>

<p>"I didn't quite hear."</p>

<p>"Was there any other source from which you were obtaining any
money at that time in any way?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"And how much was your room?"</p>

<p>"Seven dollars a week."</p>

<p>"And your board?"</p>

<p>"Oh, from five to six."</p>

<p>"Any other expenses?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir&mdash;my clothes and laundry."</p>

<p>"You had to stand your share of whatever social doings were on
foot, didn't you?"</p>

<p>"Objected to as leading!" called Mason.</p>

<p>"Objection sustained," replied Justice Oberwaltzer.</p>

<p>"Any other expenses that you can think of?"</p>

<p>"Well, there were carfares and trainfares. And then I had to
share in whatever social expenses there were."</p>

<p>"Exactly!" cried Mason, with great irritation. "I wish you would
quit leading this parrot here."</p>

<p>"I wish the honorable district attorney would mind his own
business!" snorted Jephson&mdash;as much for Clyde's benefit as for
his own. He wished to break down his fear of Mason. "I'm examining
this defendant, and as for parrots we've seen quite a number of
them around here in the last few weeks, and coached to the throat
like school-boys."</p>

<p>"That's a malicious lie!" shouted Mason. "I object and demand an
apology."</p>

<p>"The apology is to me and to this defendant, if your Honor
pleases, and will be exacted quickly if your Honor will only
adjourn this court for a few minutes," and then stepping directly
in front of Mason, he added: "And I will be able to obtain it
without any judicial aid." Whereupon Mason, thinking he was about
to be attacked, squared off, the while assistants and deputy
sheriffs, and stenographers and writers, and the clerk of the court
himself, gathered round and seized the two lawyers while Justice
Oberwaltzer pounded violently on his desk with his gavel:</p>

<p>"Gentlemen! Gentlemen! You are both in contempt of court, both
of you! You will apologize to the court and to each other, or I'll
declare a mistrial and commit you both for ten days and fine you
five hundred dollars each." With this he leaned down and frowned on
both. And at once Jephson replied, most suavely and ingratiatingly:
"Under the circumstances, your Honor, I apologize to you and to the
attorney for the People and to this jury. The attack on this
defendant, by the district attorney, seemed too unfair and uncalled
for&mdash;that was all."</p>

<p>"Never mind that," continued Oberwaltzer.</p>

<p>"Under the circumstances, your Honor, I apologize to you and to
the counsel for the defense. I was a little hasty, perhaps. And to
this defendant also," sneered Mason, after first looking into
Justice Oberwaltzer's angry and uncompromising eyes and then into
Clyde's, who instantly recoiled and turned away.</p>

<p>"Proceed," growled Oberwaltzer, sullenly.</p>

<p>"Now, Clyde," resumed Jephson anew, as calm as though he had
just lit and thrown away a match. "You say your salary was
twenty-five dollars and you had these various expenses. Had you, up
to this time, been able to put aside any money for a rainy
day?"</p>

<p>"No, sir&mdash;not much&mdash;not any, really."</p>

<p>"Well, then, supposing some doctor to whom Miss Alden had
applied had been willing to assist her and wanted&mdash;say a
hundred dollars or so&mdash;were you ready to furnish that?"</p>

<p>"No, sir&mdash;not right off, that is."</p>

<p>"Did she have any money of her own that you know of?"</p>

<p>"None that I know of&mdash;no, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, how did you intend to help her then?"</p>

<p>"Well, I thought if either she or I found any one and he would
wait and let me pay for it on time, that I could save and pay it
that way, maybe."</p>

<p>"I see. You were perfectly willing to do that, were you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I was."</p>

<p>"You told her so, did you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. She knew that."</p>

<p>"Well, when neither you nor she could find any one to help her,
then what? What did you do next?"</p>

<p>"Well, then she wanted me to marry her."</p>

<p>"Right away?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. Right away."</p>

<p>"And what did you say to that?"</p>

<p>"I told her I just couldn't then. I didn't have any money to get
married on. And besides if I did and didn't go away somewhere, at
least until the baby was born, everybody would find out and I
couldn't have stayed there anyhow. And she couldn't either."</p>

<p>"And why not?"</p>

<p>"Well, there were my relatives. They wouldn't have wanted to
keep me any more, or her either, I guess."</p>

<p>"I see. They wouldn't have considered you fit for the work you
were doing, or her either. Is that it?"</p>

<p>"I thought so, anyhow," replied Clyde.</p>

<p>"And then what?"</p>

<p>"Well, even if I had wanted to go away with her and marry her, I
didn't have enough money to do that and she didn't either. I would
have had to give up my place and gone and found another somewhere
before I could let her come. Besides that, I didn't know any place
where I could go and earn as much as I did there."</p>

<p>"How about hotel work? Couldn't you have gone back to that?"</p>

<p>"Well, maybe&mdash;if I had an introduction of some kind. But I
didn't want to go back to that."</p>

<p>"And why not?"</p>

<p>"Well, I didn't like it so much any more&mdash;not that kind of
life."</p>

<p>"But you didn't mean that you didn't want to do anything at all,
did you? That wasn't your attitude, was it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, sir. That wasn't it. I told her right away if she would
go away for a while&mdash;while she had her baby&mdash;and let me
stay on there in Lycurgus, that I would try to live on less and
give her all I could save until she was all right again."</p>

<p>"But not marry her?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, I didn't feel that I could do that then."</p>

<p>"And what did she say to that?"</p>

<p>"She wouldn't do it. She said she couldn't and wouldn't go
through with it unless I would marry her."</p>

<p>"I see. Then and there?"</p>

<p>"Well, yes&mdash;pretty soon, anyhow. She was willing to wait a
little while, but she wouldn't go away unless I would marry
her."</p>

<p>"And did you tell her that you didn't care for her any
more?"</p>

<p>"Well, nearly&mdash;yes, sir"</p>

<p>"What do you mean by 'nearly'?"</p>

<p>"Well, that I didn't want to. Besides, she knew I didn't care
for her any more. She said so herself."</p>

<p>"To you, at that time?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. Lots of times."</p>

<p>"Well, yes, that's true&mdash;it was in all of those letters of
hers that were read here. But when she refused so flatly, what did
you do then?"</p>

<p>"Well, I didn't know what to do. But I thought maybe if I could
get her to go up to her home for a while, while I tried and saved
what I could&mdash;well...maybe...once she was up there and saw how
much I didn't want to marry her&mdash;" (Clyde paused and fumbled
at his lips. This lying was hard.)</p>

<p>"Yes, go on. And remember, the truth, however ashamed of it you
may be, is better than any lie."</p>

<p>"And maybe when she was a little more frightened and not so
determined&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Weren't you frightened, too?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I was."</p>

<p>"Well, go on."</p>

<p>"That then&mdash;well&mdash;maybe if I offered her all that I
had been able to save up to then&mdash;you see I thought maybe I
might be able to borrow some from some one too&mdash;that she might
be willing to go away and not make me marry her&mdash;just live
somewhere and let me help her."</p>

<p>"I see. But she wouldn't agree to that?"</p>

<p>"Well, no&mdash;not to my not marrying her, no&mdash;but to
going up there for a month, yes. I couldn't get her to say that she
would let me off."</p>

<p>"But did you at that or any other time before or subsequent to
that say that you would come up there and marry her?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. I never did."</p>

<p>"Just what did you say then?"</p>

<p>"I said that...as soon as I could get the money," stuttered
Clyde at this point, so nervous and shamed was he, "I would come
for her in about a month and we could go away somewhere
until&mdash; until&mdash;well, until she was out of that."</p>

<p>"But you did not tell her that you would marry her?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. I did not."</p>

<p>"But she wanted you to, of course."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Had you any notion that she could force you so to do at that
time&mdash; marry her against your will, I mean?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, I didn't. Not if I could help it. My plan was to wait
as long as I could and save all the money I could and then when the
time came just refuse and give her all the money that I had and
help her all I could from then on."</p>

<p>"But you know," proceeded Jephson, most suavely and
diplomatically at this point, "there are various references in
these letters here which Miss Alden wrote you"&mdash;and he reached
over and from the district attorney's table picked up the original
letters of Roberta and weighed them solemnly in his hand&mdash;"to
a <i>plan</i> which you two had in connection with this
trip&mdash;or at least that she seemed to think you had. Now,
exactly what was that plan? She distinctly refers to it, if I
recall aright, as 'our plan.'"</p>

<p>"I know that," replied Clyde&mdash;since for two months now he,
along with Belknap and Jephson, had discussed this particular
question. "But the only plan I know of"&mdash;and here he did his
best to look frank and be convincing&mdash;"was the one I offered
over and over."</p>

<p>"And what was that?"</p>

<p>"Why, that she go away and take a room somewhere and let me help
her and come over and see her once in a while."</p>

<p>"Well, no, you're wrong there," returned Jephson, slyly. "That
isn't and couldn't be the plan she had in mind. She says in one of
these letters that she knows it will be hard on you to have to go
away and stay so long, or until she is out of this thing, but that
it can't be helped."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know," replied Clyde, quickly and exactly as he had been
told to do, "but that was her plan, not mine. She kept saying to me
most of the time that that was what she wanted me to do, and that I
would have to do it. She told me that over the telephone several
times, and I may have said all right, all right, not meaning that I
agreed with her entirely but that I wanted to talk with her about
it some more later."</p>

<p>"I see. And so that's what you think&mdash;that she meant one
thing and you meant another."</p>

<p>"Well, I know I never agreed to her plan&mdash;exactly. That is,
I never did any more than just to ask her to wait and not do
anything until I could get money enough together to come up there
and talk to her some more and get her to go away&mdash;the way I
suggested."</p>

<p>"But if she wouldn't accede to your plan, then what?"</p>

<p>"Well, then I was going to tell her about Miss X, and beg her to
let me go."</p>

<p>"And if she still wouldn't?"</p>

<p>"Well, then I thought I might run away, but I didn't like to
think about that very much."</p>

<p>"You know, Clyde, of course, that some here are of the opinion
that there was a plot on your part which originated in your mind
about this time to conceal your identity and hers and lure her up
there to one of those lone lakes in the Adirondacks and slay her or
drown her in cold blood, in order that you might be free to marry
this Miss X. Any truth in that? Tell this jury&mdash;yes or
no&mdash;which is it?"</p>

<p>"No! No! I never did plot to kill her, or any one," protested
Clyde, quite dramatically, and clutching at the arms of his chair
and seeking to be as emphatic as possible, since he had been
instructed so to do. At the same time he arose in his seat and
sought to look stern and convincing, although in his heart and mind
was the crying knowledge that he had so plotted, and this it was
that most weakened him at this moment&mdash;most painfully and
horribly weakened him. The eyes of all these people. The eyes of
the judge and jury and Mason and all the men and women of the
press. And once more his brow was wet and cold and he licked his
thin lips nervously and swallowed with difficulty because his
throat was dry.</p>

<p>And then it was that piecemeal, and beginning with the series of
letters written by Roberta to Clyde after she reached her home and
ending with the one demanding that he come for her or she would
return to Lycurgus and expose him, Jephson took up the various
phases of the "alleged" plot and crime, and now did his best to
minimize and finally dispel all that had been testified to so
far.</p>

<p>Clyde's suspicious actions in not writing Roberta. Well, he was
afraid of complications in connection with his relatives, his work,
everything. And the same with his arranging to meet her in Fonda.
He had no plan as to any trip with her anywhere in particular at
the time. He only thought vaguely of meeting her somewhere&mdash;
anywhere&mdash;and possibly persuading her to leave him. But July
arriving and his plan still so indefinite, the first thing that
occurred to him was that they might go off to some inexpensive
resort somewhere. It was Roberta who in Utica had suggested some of
the lakes north of there. It was there in the hotel, not at the
railway station, that he had secured some maps and folders&mdash;a
fatal contention in one sense, for Mason had one folder with a
Lycurgus House stamp on the cover, which Clyde had not noticed at
the time. And as he was so testifying, Mason was thinking of this.
In regard to leaving Lycurgus by a back street&mdash;well, there
had been a desire to conceal his departure with Roberta, of course,
but only to protect her name and his from notoriety. And so with
the riding in separate cars, registering as Mr. and Mrs. Clifford
Golden, and so on indefinitely throughout the entire list of shifty
concealments and evasions. In regard to the two hats, well, the one
hat was soiled and seeing one that he liked he bought it. Then when
he lost the hat in the accident he naturally put on the other. To
be sure, he had owned and carried a camera, and it was true that he
had it at the Cranstons' on his first visit there on the eighteenth
of June. The only reason he denied having it at first was because
he was afraid of being identified with this purely accidental death
of Roberta in a way that would be difficult to explain. He had been
falsely charged with her murder immediately upon his arrest in the
woods, and he was fearful of his entire connection with this
ill-fated trip, and not having any lawyer or any one to say a word
for him, he thought it best to say nothing and so for the time
being had denied everything, although at once on being provided
counsel he had confided to his attorneys the true facts of the
case.</p>

<p>And so, too, with the missing suit, which because it was wet and
muddy he had done up in a bundle in the woods and after reaching
the Cranstons' had deposited it behind some stones there, intending
to return and secure it and have it dry-cleaned. But on being
introduced to Mr. Belknap and Mr. Jephson he had at once told both
and they had secured it and had it cleaned for him.</p>

<p>"But now, Clyde, in regard to your plans and your being out on
that lake in the first place&mdash;let's hear about that now."</p>

<p>And then&mdash;quite as Jephson had outlined it to Belknap, came
the story of how he and Roberta had reached Utica and afterwards
Grass Lake. And yet no plan. He intended, if worst came to worst,
to tell her of his great love for Miss X and appeal to her sympathy
and understanding to set him free at the same time that he offered
to do anything that he could for her. If she refused he intended to
defy her and leave Lycurgus, if necessary, and give up
everything.</p>

<p>"But when I saw her at Fonda, and later in Utica, looking as
tired and worried as she was," and here Clyde was endeavoring to
give the ring of sincerity to words carefully supplied him, "and
sort of helpless, I began to feel sorry for her again."</p>

<p>"Yes, and then what?"</p>

<p>"Well, I wasn't quite so sure whether in case she refused to let
me off I could go through with leaving her."</p>

<p>"Well, what did you decide then?"</p>

<p>"Not anything just then. I listened to what she had to say and I
tried to tell her how hard it was going to be for me to do anything
much, even if I did go away with her. I only had fifty
dollars."</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"And then she began to cry, and I decided I couldn't talk to her
any more about it there. She was too run-down and nervous. So I
asked her if there wasn't any place she would like to go to for a
day or two to brace herself up a little," went on Clyde, only here
on account of the blackness of the lie he was telling he twisted
and swallowed in the weak, stigmatic way that was his whenever he
was attempting something which was beyond him&mdash;any untruth or
a feat of skill&mdash;and then added: "And she said yes, maybe to
one of those lakes up in the Adirondacks&mdash;it didn't make much
difference which one&mdash;if we could afford it. And when I told
her, mostly because of the way she was feeling, that I thought we
could&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then you really only went up there on her account?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, only on account of her."</p>

<p>"I see. Go on."</p>

<p>"Well, then she said if I would go downstairs or somewhere and
get some folders we might be able to find a place up there
somewhere where it wasn't so expensive."</p>

<p>"And did you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, and then what?"</p>

<p>"Well, we looked them over and we finally hit on Grass
Lake."</p>

<p>"Who did? The two of you&mdash;or she?"</p>

<p>"Well, she took one folder and I took another, and in hers she
found an ad about an inn up there where two people could stay for
twenty-one dollars a week, or five dollars a day for the two. And I
thought we couldn't do much better than that for one day."</p>

<p>"Was one day all you intended to stay?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. Not if she wanted to stay longer. My idea at first was
that we might stay one or two days or three. I couldn't tell&mdash;
whatever time it took me to talk things out with her and make her
understand and see where I stood."</p>

<p>"I see. And then...?"</p>

<p>"Well, then we went up to Grass Lake the next morning."</p>

<p>"In separate cars still?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir&mdash;in separate cars."</p>

<p>"And when you got there?"</p>

<p>"Why, we registered."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"Clifford Graham and wife."</p>

<p>"Still afraid some one would know who you were?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Did you try to disguise your handwriting in any way?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir&mdash;a little."</p>

<p>"But just why did you always use your own initials&mdash;C.
G.?"</p>

<p>"Well, I thought that the initials on my bag should be the same
as the initials on the register, and still not be my name
either."</p>

<p>"I see. Clever in one sense, not so clever in another&mdash;just
half clever, which is the worst of all." At this Mason half rose in
his seat as though to object, but evidently changing his mind, sank
slowly back again. And once more Jephson's right eye swiftly and
inquiringly swept the jury to his right. "Well, did you finally
explain to her that you wanted to be done with it all as you had
planned&mdash;or did you not?"</p>

<p>"I wanted to talk to her about it just after we got there if I
could&mdash;the next morning, anyhow&mdash;but just as soon as we
got off up there and got settled she kept saying to me that if I
would only marry her then&mdash;that she would not want to stay
married long&mdash;that she was so sick and worried and felt so
bad&mdash;that all she wanted to do was to get through and give the
baby a name, and after that she would go away and let me go my way,
too."</p>

<p>"And then?"</p>

<p>"Well, and then&mdash;then we went out on the lake&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Which lake, Clyde?"</p>

<p>"Why, Grass Lake. We went out for a row after we got there."</p>

<p>"Right away? In the afternoon?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. She wanted to go. And then while we were out there
rowing around&mdash;" (He paused.)</p>

<p>"She got to crying again, and she seemed so much up against it
and looked so sick and so worried that I decided that after all she
was right and I was wrong&mdash;that it wouldn't be right, on
account of the baby and all, not to marry her, and so I thought I
had better do it."</p>

<p>"I see. A change of heart. And did you tell her that then and
there?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"And why not? Weren't you satisfied with the trouble you had
caused her so far?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. But you see just as I was going to talk to her at
that time I got to thinking of all the things I had been thinking
before I came up."</p>

<p>"What, for instance?"</p>

<p>"Why, Miss X and my life in Lycurgus, and what we'd be up
against in case we did go away this way."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And...well...and then I couldn't just tell her then&mdash;not
that day, anyhow."</p>

<p>"Well, when did you tell her then?"</p>

<p>"Well, I told her not to cry any more&mdash;that I thought maybe
it would be all right if she gave me twenty-four hours more to
think things all out&mdash;that maybe we'd be able to settle on
something."</p>

<p>"And then?"</p>

<p>"Well, then she said after a while that she didn't care for
Grass Lake. She wished we would go away from there."</p>

<p>"<i>She</i> did?"</p>

<p>"Yes. And then we got out the maps again and I asked a fellow at
the hotel there if he knew about the lakes up there. And he said of
all the lakes around there Big Bittern was the most beautiful. I
had seen it once, and I told Roberta about it and what the man
said, and then she asked why didn't we go there."</p>

<p>"And is that why you went there?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir"</p>

<p>"No other reason?"</p>

<p>"No, sir&mdash;none&mdash;except that it was back, or south, and
we were going that way anyhow."</p>

<p>"I see. And that was Thursday, July eighth?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, now, Clyde, as you have seen, it has been charged here
that you took Miss Alden to and out on that lake with the sole and
premeditated intent of killing her&mdash;murdering
her&mdash;finding some unobserved and quiet spot and then first
striking her with your camera, or an oar, or club, or stone maybe,
and then drowning her. Now, what have you to say to that? Is that
true, or isn't it?"</p>

<p>"No, sir! It's not true!" returned Clyde, clearly and
emphatically. "I never went there of my own accord in the first
place, and I only went there because she didn't like Grass Lake."
And here, because he had been sinking down in his chair, he pulled
himself up and looked at the jury and the audience with what
measure of strength and conviction he could summon&mdash;as
previously he had been told to do. At the same time he added: "And
I wanted to please her in any way that I could so that she might be
a little more cheerful."</p>

<p>"Were you still as sorry for her on this Thursday as you had
been the day before?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir&mdash;more, I think."</p>

<p>"And had you definitely made up your mind by then as to what you
wanted to do?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, and just what was that?"</p>

<p>"Well, I had decided to play as fair as I could. I had been
thinking about it all night, and I realized how badly she would
feel and I too if I didn't do the right thing by her&mdash;because
she had said three or four times that if I didn't she would kill
herself. And I had made up my mind that morning that whatever else
happened that day, I was going to straighten the whole thing
out."</p>

<p>"This was at Grass Lake. You were still in the hotel on Thursday
morning?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"And you were going to tell her just what?"</p>

<p>"Well, that I knew that I hadn't treated her quite right and
that I was sorry&mdash;besides, that her offer was fair enough, and
that if after what I was going to tell her she still wanted me, I
would go away with her and marry her. But that I had to tell her
first the real reason for my changing as I had&mdash;that I had
been and still was in love with another girl and that I couldn't
help it&mdash;that probably whether I married her or
not&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Miss Alden you mean?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir&mdash;that I would always go on loving this other
girl, because I just couldn't get her out of my mind. But just the
same, if that didn't make any difference to her, that I would marry
her even if I couldn't love her any more as I once did. That was
all."</p>

<p>"But what about Miss X?"</p>

<p>"Well, I had thought about her too, but I thought she was better
off and could stand it easier. Besides, I thought perhaps Roberta
would let me go and we could just go on being friends and I would
help her all I could."</p>

<p>"Had you decided just where you would marry her?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. But I knew there were plenty of towns below Big
Bittern and Grass Lake."</p>

<p>"But were you going to do that without one single word to Miss X
beforehand?"</p>

<p>"Well, no, sir&mdash;not exactly. I figured that if Roberta
wouldn't let me off but didn't mind my leaving her for a few days,
I would go down to where Miss X lived and tell her, and then come
back. But if she objected to that, why then I was going to write
Miss X a letter and explain how it was and then go on and get
married to Roberta."</p>

<p>"I see. But, Clyde, among other bits of testimony here, there
was that letter found in Miss Alden's coat pocket&mdash;the one
written on Grass Lake Inn stationery and addressed to her mother,
in which she told her that she was about to be married. Had you
already told her up there at Grass Lake that morning that you were
going to marry her for sure?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. Not exactly, but I did say on getting up that day that
it was the deciding day for us and that she was going to be able to
decide for herself whether she wanted me to marry her or not."</p>

<p>"Oh, I see. So that's it," smiled Jephson, as though greatly
relieved. (And Mason and Newcomb and Burleigh and State Senator
Redmond all listening with the profoundest attention, now
exclaimed, sotto voce and almost in unison: "Of all the bunk!")</p>

<p>"Well, now we come to the trip itself. You have heard the
testimony here and the dark motive and plotting that has been
attributed to every move in connection with it. Now I want you to
tell it in your own way. It has been testified here that you took
both bags&mdash;yours and hers&mdash;up there with you but that you
left hers at Gun Lodge when you got there and took your own out on
the lake in that boat with you. Now just why did you do that?
Please speak so that all of the jurymen can hear you."</p>

<p>"Well, the reason for that was," and here once more his throat
became so dry that he could scarcely speak, "we didn't know whether
we could get any lunch at Big Bittern, so we decided to take some
things along with us from Grass Lake. Her bag was packed full of
things, but there was room in mine. Besides, it had my camera with
the tripod outside. So I decided to leave hers and take mine."</p>

<p>"<i>You</i> decided?"</p>

<p>"Well, I asked her what she thought and she said she thought
that was best."</p>

<p>"Where was it you asked her that?"</p>

<p>"On the train coming down."</p>

<p>"And did you know then that you were coming back to Gun Lodge
after going out on the lake?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I did. We had to. There was no other road. They told
us that at Grass Lake."</p>

<p>"And in riding over to Big Bittern&mdash;do you recall the
testimony of the driver who drove you over&mdash;that you were
'very nervous' and that you asked him whether there were many
people over that that day?"</p>

<p>"I recall it, yes, sir, but I wasn't nervous at all. I may have
asked about the people, but I can't see anything wrong with that.
It seems to me that any one might ask that."</p>

<p>"And so it seems to me," echoed Jephson. "Then what happened
after you registered at Big Bittern Inn and got into that boat and
went out on the lake with Miss Alden? Were you or she especially
preoccupied or nervous or in any state different from that of any
ordinary person who goes out on a lake to row? Were you
particularly happy or particularly gloomy, or what?"</p>

<p>"Well, I don't think I was especially gloomy&mdash;no, sir. I
was thinking of all I was going to tell her, of course, and of what
was before me either way she decided. I wasn't exactly gay, I
guess, but I thought it would be all right whichever way things
went. I had decided that I was willing to marry her."</p>

<p>"And how about her? Was she quite cheerful?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;yes, sir. She seemed to feel much happier for some
reason."</p>

<p>"And what did you talk about?"</p>

<p>"Oh, about the lake first&mdash;how beautiful it was and where
we would have our lunch when we were ready for it. And then we
rowed along the west shore looking for water lilies. She was so
happy that I hated to bring up anything just then, and so we just
kept on rowing until about two, when we stopped for lunch."</p>

<p>"Just where was that? Just get up and trace on the map with that
pointer there just where you did go and how long you stopped and
for what."</p>

<p>And so Clyde, pointer in hand and standing before the large map
of the lake and region which particularly concerned this tragedy,
now tracing in detail the long row along the shore, a group of
trees, which, after having lunch, they had rowed to see&mdash;a
beautiful bed of water lilies which they had lingered
over&mdash;each point at which they had stopped, until reaching
Moon Cove at about five in the afternoon, they had been so
entranced by its beauty that they had merely sat and gazed, as he
said. Afterwards, in order that he might take some pictures, they
had gone ashore in the woods nearby&mdash; he all the while
preparing himself to tell Roberta of Miss X and ask her for her
final decision. And then having left the bag on shore for a few
moments while they rowed out and took some snapshots in the boat,
they had drifted in the calm of the water and the stillness and
beauty until finally he had gathered sufficient courage to tell her
what was in his heart. And at first, as he now said, Roberta seemed
greatly startled and depressed and began crying a little, saying
that perhaps it was best for her not to live any longer&mdash;she
felt so miserable. But, afterwards, when he had impressed on her
the fact that he was really sorry and perfectly willing to make
amends, she had suddenly changed and begun to grow more cheerful,
and then of a sudden, in a burst of tenderness and
gratefulness&mdash;he could not say exactly&mdash;she had jumped up
and tried to come to him. Her arms were outstretched and she moved
as if to throw herself at his feet or into his lap. But just then,
her foot, or her dress, had caught and she had stumbled. And
he&mdash;camera in hand&mdash;(a last minute decision or legal
precaution on the part of Jephson)&mdash;had risen instinctively to
try to catch her and stop her fall. Perhaps&mdash;he would not be
able to say here&mdash;her face or hand had struck the camera. At
any rate, the next moment, before he quite understood how it all
happened, and without time for thought or action on his part or
hers, both were in the water and the boat, which had overturned,
seemed to have struck Roberta, for she seemed to be stunned.</p>

<p>"I called to her to try to get to the boat&mdash;it was moving
away&mdash;to take hold of it, but she didn't seem to hear me or
understand what I meant. I was afraid to go too near her at first
because she was striking out in every direction&mdash;and before I
could swim ten strokes forward her head had gone down once and come
up and then gone down again for a second time. By then the boat had
floated all of thirty or forty feet away and I knew that I couldn't
get her into that. And then I decided that if I wanted to save
myself I had better swim ashore."</p>

<p>And once there, as he now narrated, it suddenly occurred to him
how peculiar and suspicious were all the circumstances surrounding
his present position. He suddenly realized, as he now said, how had
the whole thing looked from the beginning. The false registering.
The fact his bag was there&mdash;hers not. Besides, to return now
meant that he would have to explain and it would become generally
known&mdash; and everything connected with his life would
go&mdash;Miss X, his work, his social
position&mdash;all&mdash;whereas, if he said nothing (and here it
was, and for the first time, as he now swore, that this thought
occurred to him), it might be assumed that he too had drowned. In
view of this fact and that any physical help he might now give her
would not restore her to life, and that acknowledgment would mean
only trouble for him and shame for her, he decided to say nothing.
And so, to remove all traces, he had taken off his clothes and
wrung them out and wrapped them for packing as best he could. Next,
having left the tripod on shore with his bag, he decided to hide
that, and did. His first straw hat, the one without the lining (but
about which absent lining he now declared he knew nothing), had
been lost with the overturning of the boat, and so now he had put
on the extra one he had with him, although he also had a cap which
he might have worn. (He usually carried an extra hat on a trip
because so often, it seemed, something happened to one.) Then he
had ventured to walk south through the woods toward a railroad
which he thought cut through the woods in that direction. He had
not known of any automobile road through there then, and as for
making for the Cranstons so directly, he confessed quite simply
that he would naturally have gone there. They were his friends and
he wanted to get off somewhere where he could think about this
terrible thing that had descended upon him so suddenly out of a
clear sky.</p>

<p>And then having testified to so much&mdash;and no more appearing
to occur either to Jephson or himself&mdash;the former after a
pause now turned and said, most distinctly and yet somehow
quietly:</p>

<p>"Now, Clyde, you have taken a solemn oath before this jury, this
judge, all these people here, and above all your God, to tell the
truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. You realize what
that means, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I do."</p>

<p>"You swear before God that you did not strike Roberta Alden in
that boat?"</p>

<p>"I swear. I did not."</p>

<p>"Or throw her into the lake?"</p>

<p>"I swear it. I did not."</p>

<p>"Or willfully or willingly in any way attempt to upset that boat
or in any other fashion bring about the death that she
suffered?"</p>

<p>"I swear it!" cried Clyde, emphatically and emotionally.</p>

<p>"You swear that it was an accident&mdash;unpremeditated and
undesigned by you?"</p>

<p>"I do," lied Clyde, who felt that in fighting for his life he
was telling a part of the truth, for that accident was
unpremeditated and undesigned. It had not been as he had planned
and he could swear to that.</p>

<p>And then Jephson, running one of his large strong hands over his
face and looking blandly and nonchalantly around upon the court and
jury, the while he compressed his thin lips into a long and
meaningful line, announced: "The prosecution may take the
witness."</p>

<h3>Chapter 25</h3>

<p>The mood of Mason throughout the entire direct examination was
that of a restless harrier anxious to be off at the heels of its
prey&mdash; of a foxhound within the last leap of its kill. A keen
and surging desire to shatter this testimony, to show it to be from
start to finish the tissue of lies that in part at least it was,
now animated him. And no sooner had Jephson concluded than he
leaped up and confronted Clyde, who, seeing him blazing with this
desire to undo him, felt as though he was about to be physically
attacked.</p>

<p>"Griffiths, you had that camera in your hand at the time she
came toward you in the boat?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"She stumbled and fell and you accidentally struck her with
it?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I don't suppose in your truthful and honest way you remember
telling me there in the woods on the shore of Big Bittern that you
never had a camera?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir&mdash;I remember that."</p>

<p>"And that was a lie, of course?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"And told with all the fervor and force that you are now telling
this other lie?"</p>

<p>"I'm not lying. I've explained why I said that."</p>

<p>"You've explained why you said that! You've explained why you
said that! And because you lied there you expect to be believed
here, do you?"</p>

<p>Belknap rose to object, but Jephson pulled him down.</p>

<p>"Well, this is the truth, just the same."</p>

<p>"And no power under heaven could make you tell another lie here,
of course&mdash;not a strong desire to save yourself from the
electric chair?"</p>

<p>Clyde blanched and quivered slightly; he blinked his red, tired
eyelids. "Well, I might, maybe, but not under oath, I don't
think."</p>

<p>"You don't think! Oh, I see. Lie all you want wherever you
are&mdash; and at any time&mdash;and under any
circumstances&mdash;except when you're on trial for murder!"</p>

<p>"No, sir. It isn't that. But what I just said is so."</p>

<p>"And you swear on the Bible, do you, that you experienced a
change of heart?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"That Miss Alden was very sad and that was what moved you to
experience this change of heart?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. That's how it was."</p>

<p>"Well, now, Griffiths, when she was up there in the country and
waiting for you&mdash;she wrote you all those letters there, did
she not?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"You received one on an average of every two days, didn't
you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"And you knew she was lonely and miserable there, didn't
you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir&mdash;but then I've explained&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, you've explained! You mean your lawyers have explained it
for you! Didn't they coach you day after day in that jail over
there as to how you were to answer when the time came?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, they didn't!" replied Clyde, defiantly, catching
Jephson's eye at this moment.</p>

<p>"Well, then when I asked you up there at Bear Lake how it was
that his girl met her death&mdash;why didn't you tell me then and
save all this trouble and suspicion and investigation? Don't you
think the public would have listened more kindly and believingly
there than it will now after you've taken five long months to think
it all out with the help of two lawyers?"</p>

<p>"But I didn't think it out with any lawyers," persisted Clyde,
still looking at Jephson, who was supporting him with all his
mental strength. "I've just explained why I did that."</p>

<p>"You've explained! You've explained!" roared Mason, almost
beside himself with the knowledge that this false explanation was
sufficient of a shield or barrier for Clyde to hide behind whenever
he found himself being too hard pressed&mdash;the little rat! And
so now he fairly quivered with baffled rage as he proceeded.</p>

<p>"And before you went up&mdash;while she was writing them to
you&mdash;you considered them sad, didn't you?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes, sir. That is"&mdash;he hesitated
incautiously&mdash;"some parts of them anyhow."</p>

<p>"Oh, I see&mdash;only some parts of them now. I thought you just
said you considered them sad."</p>

<p>"Well, I do."</p>

<p>"And did."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir&mdash;and did." But Clyde's eyes were beginning to
wander nervously in the direction of Jephson, who was fixing him as
with a beam of light.</p>

<p>"Remember her writing you this?" And here Mason picked up and
opened one of the letters and began reading: "Clyde&mdash;I shall
certainly die, dear, if you don't come. I am so much alone. I am
nearly crazy now. I wish I could go away and never return or
trouble you any more. But if you would only telephone me, even so
much as once every other day, since you won't write. And when I
need you and a word of encouragement so." Mason's voice was mellow.
It was sad. One could feel, as he spoke, the wave of passing pity
that was moving as sound and color not only through him but through
every spectator in the high, narrow courtroom. "Does that seem at
all sad to you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, it does."</p>

<p>"Did it then?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, it did."</p>

<p>"You knew it was sincere, didn't you?" snarled Mason.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. I did."</p>

<p>"Then why didn't a little of that pity that you claim moved you
so deeply out there in the center of Big Bittern move you down
there in Lycurgus to pick up the telephone there in Mrs. Peyton's
house where you were and reassure that lonely girl by so much as a
word that you were coming? Was it because your pity for her then
wasn't as great as it was after she wrote you that threatening
letter? Or was it because you had a plot and you were afraid that
too much telephoning to her might attract attention? How was it
that you had so much pity all of a sudden up at Big Bittern, but
none at all down there at Lycurgus? Is it something you can turn on
and off like a faucet?"</p>

<p>"I never said I had none at all," replied Clyde, defiantly,
having just received an eye-flash from Jephson.</p>

<p>"Well, you left her to wait until she had to threaten you
because of her own terror and misery."</p>

<p>"Well, I've admitted that I didn't treat her right."</p>

<p>"Ha, ha! Right! <i>Right</i>! And because of that admission and
in face of all the other testimony we've had here, your own
included, you expect to walk out of here a free man, do you?"</p>

<p>Belknap was not to be restrained any longer. His objection
came&mdash; and with bitter vehemence he addressed the judge: "This
is infamous, your Honor. Is the district attorney to be allowed to
make a speech with every question?"</p>

<p>"I heard no objection," countered the court. "The district
attorney will frame his questions properly."</p>

<p>Mason took the rebuke lightly and turned again to Clyde. "In
that boat there in the center of Big Bittern you have testified
that you had in your hand that camera that you once denied
owning?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"And she was in the stern of the boat?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Bring in that boat, will you, Burton?" he called to Burleigh at
this point, and forthwith four deputies from the district
attorney's office retired through a west door behind the judge's
rostrum and soon returned carrying the identical boat in which
Clyde and Roberta had sat, and put it down before the jury. And as
they did so Clyde chilled and stared. The identical boat! He
blinked and quivered as the audience stirred, stared and strained,
an audible wave of curiosity and interest passing over the entire
room. And then Mason, taking the camera and shaking it up and down,
exclaimed: "Well, here you are now, Griffiths! The camera you never
owned. Step down here into this boat and take this camera here and
show the jury just where you sat, and where Miss Alden sat. And
exactly, if you can, how and where it was that you struck Miss
Alden and where and about how she fell."</p>

<p>"Object!" declared Belknap.</p>

<p>A long and wearisome legal argument, finally terminating in the
judge allowing this type of testimony to be continued for a while
at least. And at the conclusion of it, Clyde declaring: "I didn't
intentionally strike her with it though"&mdash;to which Mason
replied: "Yes, we heard you testify that way"&mdash;then Clyde
stepping down and after being directed here and there finally
stepping into the boat at the middle seat and seating himself while
three men held it straight.</p>

<p>"And now, Newcomb&mdash;I want you to come here and sit wherever
Miss Alden was supposed to sit and take any position which he
describes as having been taken by her."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said Newcomb, coming forward and seating himself
while Clyde vainly sought to catch Jephson's eye but could not
since his own back was partially turned from him.</p>

<p>"And now, Griffiths," went on Mason, "just you show Mr. Newcomb
here how Miss Alden arose and came toward you. Direct him."</p>

<p>And then Clyde, feeling weak and false and hated, arising again
and in a nervous and angular way&mdash;the eerie strangeness of all
this affecting him to the point of unbelievable
awkwardness&mdash;attempting to show Newcomb just how Roberta had
gotten up and half walked and half crawled, then had stumbled and
fallen. And after that, with the camera in his hand, attempting to
show as nearly as he could recall, how unconsciously his arm had
shot out and he had struck Roberta, he scarcely knowing
where&mdash;on the chin and cheek maybe, he was not sure, but not
intentionally, of course, and not with sufficient force really to
injure her, he thought at the time. But just here a long wrangle
between Belknap and Mason as to the competency of such testimony
since Clyde declared that he could not remember clearly&mdash;but
Oberwaltzer finally allowing the testimony on the ground that it
would show, relatively, whether a light or heavy push or blow was
required in order to upset any one who might be "lightly" or
"loosely" poised.</p>

<p>"But how in Heaven's name are these antics as here demonstrated
on a man of Mr. Newcomb's build to show what would follow in the
case of a girl of the size and weight of Miss Alden?" persisted
Belknap.</p>

<p>"Well, then we'll put a girl of the size and weight of Miss
Alden in here." And at once calling for Zillah Saunders and putting
her in Newcomb's place. But Belknap none-the-less proceeding
with:</p>

<p>"And what of that? The conditions aren't the same. This boat
isn't on the water. No two people are going to be alike in their
resistance or their physical responses to accidental blows."</p>

<p>"Then you refuse to allow this demonstration to be made?" (This
was from Mason, turning and cynically inquiring.)</p>

<p>"Oh, make it if you choose. It doesn't mean anything though, as
anybody can see," persisted Belknap, suggestively.</p>

<p>And so Clyde, under directions from Mason, now pushing at
Zillah, "about as hard," (he thought) as he had accidentally pushed
at Roberta. And she falling back a little&mdash;not much&mdash;but
in so doing being able to lay a hand on each side of the boat and
so save herself. And the jury, in spite of Belknap's thought that
his contentions would have counteracted all this, gathering the
impression that Clyde, on account of his guilt and fear of death,
was probably attempting to conjure something that had been much
more viciously executed, to be sure. For had not the doctors sworn
to the probable force of this and another blow on the top of the
head? And had not Burton Burleigh testified to having discovered a
hair in the camera? And how about the cry that woman had heard? How
about that?</p>

<p>But with that particular incident the court was adjourned for
this day.</p>

<p>On the following morning at the sound of the gavel, there was
Mason, as fresh and vigorous and vicious as ever. And Clyde, after
a miserable night in his cell and much bolstering by Jephson and
Belknap, determined to be as cool and insistent and
innocent-appearing as he could be, but with no real heart for the
job, so convinced was he that local sentiment in its entirety was
against him&mdash;that he was believed to be guilty. And with Mason
beginning most savagely and bitterly:</p>

<p>"You still insist that you experienced a change of heart, do
you, Griffiths?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I do."</p>

<p>"Ever hear of people being resuscitated after they have
apparently drowned?"</p>

<p>"I don't quite understand."</p>

<p>"You know, of course, that people who are supposed to be
drowned, who go down for the last time and don't come up, are
occasionally gotten out of the water and revived, brought back to
life by first-aid methods&mdash;working their arms and rolling them
over a log or a barrel. You've heard of that, haven't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I think I have. I've heard of people being brought
back to life after they're supposed to be drowned, but I don't
think I ever heard just how."</p>

<p>"You never did?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"Or how long they could stay under water and still be
revived?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. I never did."</p>

<p>"Never heard, for instance, that a person who had been in the
water as long as fifteen minutes might still be brought to?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"So it never occurred to you after you swam to shore yourself
that you might still call for aid and so save her life even
then?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, it didn't occur to me. I thought she was dead by
then."</p>

<p>"I see. But when she was still alive out there in the
water&mdash;how about that? You're a pretty good swimmer, aren't
you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I swim fairly well."</p>

<p>"Well enough, for instance, to save yourself by swimming over
five hundred feet with your shoes and clothes on. Isn't that
so?"</p>

<p>"Well, I did swim that distance then&mdash;yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Yes, you did indeed&mdash;and pretty good for a fellow who
couldn't swim thirty-five feet to an overturned boat, I'll say,"
concluded Mason.</p>

<p>Here Jephson waved aside Belknap's suggestion that he move to
have this comment stricken out.</p>

<p>Clyde was now dragged over his various boating and swimming
experiences and made to tell how many times he had gone out on
lakes in craft as dangerous as canoes and had never had an
accident.</p>

<p>"The first time you took Roberta out on Crum Lake was in a
canoe, wasn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"But you had no accident then?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"You cared for her then very much, didn't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"But the day she was drowned in Big Bittern, in this solid,
round-bottomed row-boat, you didn't care for her any more."</p>

<p>"Well, I've said how I felt then."</p>

<p>"And of course there couldn't be any relation between the fact
that on Crum Lake you cared for her but on Big Bittern&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I said how I felt then."</p>

<p>"But you wanted to get rid of her just the same, didn't you? The
moment she was dead to run away to that other girl. You don't deny
that, do you?"</p>

<p>"I've explained why I did that," reiterated Clyde.</p>

<p>"Explained! Explained! And you expect any fair-minded, decent,
intelligent person to believe that explanation, do you?" Mason was
fairly beside himself with rage and Clyde did not venture to
comment as to that. The judge anticipated Jephson's objection to
this and bellowed, "Objection sustained." But Mason went right on.
"You couldn't have been just a little careless, could you,
Griffiths, in the handling of the boat and upset it yourself, say?"
He drew near and leered.</p>

<p>"No, sir, I wasn't careless. It was an accident that I couldn't
avoid." Clyde was quite cool, though pale and tired.</p>

<p>"An accident. Like that other accident out there in Kansas City,
for instance. You're rather familiar with accidents of that kind,
aren't you, Griffiths?" queried Mason sneeringly and slowly.</p>

<p>"I've explained how that happened," replied Clyde nervously.</p>

<p>"You're rather familiar with accidents that result in death to
girls, aren't you? Do you always run away when one of them
dies?"</p>

<p>"Object," yelled Belknap, leaping to his feet.</p>

<p>"Objection sustained," called Oberwaltzer sharply. "There is
nothing before this court concerning any other accident. The
prosecution will confine itself more closely to the case in
hand."</p>

<p>"Griffiths," went on Mason, pleased with the way he had made a
return to Jephson for his apology for the Kansas City accident,
"when that boat upset after that accidental blow of yours and you
and Miss Alden fell into the water&mdash;how far apart were
you?"</p>

<p>"Well, I didn't notice just then."</p>

<p>"Pretty close, weren't you? Not much more than a foot or two,
surely&mdash;the way you stood there in the boat?"</p>

<p>"Well, I didn't notice. Maybe that, yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Close enough to have grabbed her and hung on to her if you had
wanted to, weren't you? That's what you jumped up for, wasn't it,
when she started to fall out?"</p>

<p>"Yes, that's what I jumped up for," replied Clyde heavily, "but
I wasn't close enough to grab her. I know I went right under, and
when I came up she was some little distance away."</p>

<p>"Well, how far exactly? As far as from here to this end of the
jury box or that end, or half way, or what?"</p>

<p>"Well, I say I didn't notice, quite. About as far from here to
that end, I guess," he lied, stretching the distance by at least
eight feet.</p>

<p>"Not really!" exclaimed Mason, pretending to evince
astonishment. "This boat here turns over, you both fall in the
water close together, and when you come up you and she are nearly
twenty feet apart. Don't you think your memory is getting a little
the best of you there?"</p>

<p>"Well, that's the way it looked to me when I came up."</p>

<p>"Well, now, after that boat turned over and you both came up,
where were you in relation to <i>it</i>? Here is the boat now and
where were you out there in the audience, as to distance, I
mean?"</p>

<p>"Well, as I say, I didn't exactly notice when I first came up,"
returned Clyde, looking nervously and dubiously at the space before
him. Most certainly a trap was being prepared for him. "About as
far as from here to that railing beyond your table, I guess."</p>

<p>"About thirty to thirty-five feet then," suggested Mason, slyly
and hopefully.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. About that maybe. I couldn't be quite sure."</p>

<p>"And now with you over there and the boat here, where was Miss
Alden at that time?"</p>

<p>And Clyde now sensed that Mason must have some geometric or
mathematic scheme in mind whereby he proposed to establish his
guilt. And at once he was on his guard, and looking in the
direction of Jephson. At the same time he could not see how he was
to put Roberta too far away either. He had said she couldn't swim.
Wouldn't she be nearer the boat than he was? Most certainly. He
leaped foolishly&mdash;wildly&mdash;at the thought that it might be
best to say that she was about half that distance&mdash;not more,
very likely. And said so. And at once Mason proceeded with:</p>

<p>"Well, then she was not more than fifteen feet or so from you or
the boat."</p>

<p>"No, sir, maybe not. I guess not."</p>

<p>"Well then, do you mean to say that you couldn't have swum that
little distance and buoyed her up until you could reach the boat
just fifteen feet beyond her?"</p>

<p>"Well, as I say, I was a little dazed when I came up and she was
striking about and screaming so."</p>

<p>"But there was that boat&mdash;not more than thirty-five feet
away, according to your own story&mdash;and a mighty long way for a
boat to move in that time, I'll say. And do you mean to say that
when you could swim five hundred feet to shore afterwards that you
couldn't have swum to that boat and pushed it to her in time for
her to save herself? She was struggling to keep herself up, wasn't
she?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. But I was rattled at first," pleaded Clyde, gloomily,
conscious of the eyes of all the jurors and all the spectators
fixed upon his face, "and...and..." (because of the general strain
of the suspicion and incredulity now focused as a great force upon
him, his nerve was all but failing him, and he was hesitating and
stumbling)..."I didn't think quite quick enough I guess, what to
do. Besides I was afraid if I went near her..."</p>

<p>"I know. A mental and moral coward," sneered Mason. "Besides
very slow to think when it's to your advantage to be slow and swift
when it's to your advantage to be swift. Is that it?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, then, if it isn't, just tell me this, Griffiths, why was
it, after you got out of the water a few moments later you had
sufficient presence of mind to stop and bury that tripod before
starting through the woods, whereas, when it came to rescuing her
you got rattled and couldn't do a thing? How was it that you could
get so calm and calculating the moment you set your foot on land?
What can you say to that?"</p>

<p>"Well...a...I told you that afterwards I realized that there was
nothing else to do."</p>

<p>"Yes, we know all about that. But doesn't it occur to you that
it takes a pretty cool head after so much panic in the water to
stop at a moment like that and take such a precaution as
that&mdash;burying that tripod? How was it that you could think so
well of that and not think anything about the boat a few moments
before?"</p>

<p>"Well...but..."</p>

<p>"You didn't want her to live, in spite of your alleged change of
heart! Isn't that it?" yelled Mason. "Isn't that the black, sad
truth? She was drowning, as you wanted her to drown, and you just
let her drown! Isn't that so?"</p>

<p>He was fairly trembling as he shouted this, and Clyde, the
actual boat before him and Roberta's eyes and cries as she sank
coming back to him with all their pathetic and horrible force, now
shrank and cowered in his seat&mdash;the closeness of Mason's
interpretation of what had really happened terrifying him. For
never, even to Jephson and Belknap, had he admitted that when
Roberta was in the water he had not wished to save her.
Changelessly and secretively he insisted he had wanted to but that
it had all happened so quickly, and he was so dazed and frightened
by her cries and movements, that he had not been able to do
anything before she was gone.</p>

<p>"I...I wanted to save her," he mumbled, his face quite gray,
"but...but...as I said, I was dazed...and...and..."</p>

<p>"Don't you know that you're lying!" shouted Mason, leaning still
closer, his stout arms aloft, his disfigured face glowering and
scowling like some avenging nemesis or fury of gargoyle
design&mdash; "that you deliberately and with cold-hearted cunning
allowed that poor, tortured girl to die there when you might have
rescued her as easily as you could have swum fifty of those five
hundred feet you did swim in order to save yourself?" For by now he
was convinced that he knew just how Clyde had actually slain
Roberta, something in his manner and mood convincing him, and he
was determined to drag it out of him if he could. And although
Belknap was instantly on his feet with a protest that his client
was being unfairly prejudiced in the eyes of the jury and that he
was really entitled to&mdash;and now demanded&mdash;a
mistrial&mdash;which complaint Justice Oberwaltzer eventually
overruled&mdash;still Clyde had time to reply, but most meekly and
feebly: "No! No! I didn't. I wanted to save her if I could." Yet
his whole manner, as each and every juror noted, was that of one
who was not really telling the truth, who was really all of the
mental and moral coward that Belknap had insisted he was&mdash;but
worse yet, really guilty of Roberta's death. For after all, asked
each juror of himself as he listened, why couldn't he have saved
her if he was strong enough to swim to shore afterwards&mdash;or at
least have swum to and secured the boat and helped her to take hold
of it?</p>

<p>"She only weighed a hundred pounds, didn't she?" went on Mason
feverishly.</p>

<p>"Yes, I think so."</p>

<p>"And you&mdash;what did you weigh at the time?"</p>

<p>"About a hundred and forty," replied Clyde.</p>

<p>"And a hundred and forty pound man," sneered Mason, turning to
the jury, "is afraid to go near a weak, sick, hundred-pound little
girl who is drowning, for fear she will cling to him and drag him
under! And a perfectly good boat, strong enough to hold three or
four up, within fifteen or twenty feet! How's that?"</p>

<p>And to emphasize it and let it sink in, he now paused, and took
from his pocket a large white handkerchief, and after wiping his
neck and face and wrists&mdash;since they were quite damp from his
emotional and physical efforts&mdash;turned to Burton Burleigh and
called: "You might as well have this boat taken out of here,
Burton. We're not going to need it for a little while anyhow." And
forthwith the four deputies carried it out.</p>

<p>And then, having recovered his poise, he once more turned to
Clyde and began with: "Griffiths, you knew the color and feel of
Roberta Alden's hair pretty well, didn't you? You were intimate
enough with her, weren't you?"</p>

<p>"I know the color of it or I think I do," replied Clyde
wincing&mdash; an anguished chill at the thought of it affecting
him almost observably.</p>

<p>"And the feel of it, too, didn't you?" persisted Mason. "In
those very loving days of yours before Miss X came along&mdash;you
must have touched it often enough."</p>

<p>"I don't know whether I did or not," replied Clyde, catching a
glance from Jephson.</p>

<p>"Well, roughly. You must know whether it was coarse or
fine&mdash;silky or coarse. You know that, don't you?"</p>

<p>"It was silky, yes."</p>

<p>"Well, here's a lock of it," he now added more to torture Clyde
than anything else&mdash;to wear him down nervously&mdash;and going
to his table where was an envelope and from it extracting a long
lock of light brown hair. "Don't that look like her hair?" And now
he shoved it forward at Clyde who shocked and troubled withdrew
from it as from some unclean or dangerous thing&mdash;yet a moment
after sought to recover himself&mdash;the watchful eyes of the jury
having noted all. "Oh, don't be afraid," persisted Mason,
sardonically. "It's only your dead love's hair."</p>

<p>And shocked by the comment&mdash;and noting the curious eyes of
the jury, Clyde took it in his hand. "That looks and feels like her
hair, doesn't it?" went on Mason.</p>

<p>"Well, it looks like it anyhow," returned Clyde shakily.</p>

<p>"And now here," continued Mason, stepping quickly to the table
and returning with the camera in which between the lid and the
taking mechanism were caught the two threads of Roberta's hair put
there by Burleigh, and then holding it out to him. "Just take this
camera. It's yours even though you did swear that it
wasn't&mdash;and look at those two hairs there. See them?" And he
poked the camera at Clyde as though he might strike him with it.
"They were caught in there&mdash;presumably&mdash;at the time you
struck her so lightly that it made all those wounds on her face.
Can't you tell the jury whether those hairs are hers or not?"</p>

<p>"I can't say," replied Clyde most weakly.</p>

<p>"What's that? Speak up. Don't be so much of a moral and mental
coward. Are they or are they not?"</p>

<p>"I can't say," repeated Clyde&mdash;but not even looking at
them.</p>

<p>"Look at them. Look at them. Compare them with these others. We
know these are hers. And you know that these in this camera are,
don't you? Don't be so squeamish. You've often touched her hair in
real life. She's dead. They won't bite you. Are these two
hairs&mdash;or are they not&mdash;the same as these other hairs
here&mdash;which we know are hers&mdash;the same color&mdash;same
feel&mdash;all? Look! Answer! Are they or are they not?"</p>

<p>But Clyde, under such pressure and in spite of Belknap, being
compelled to look and then feel them too. Yet cautiously replying,
"I wouldn't be able to say. They look and feel a little alike, but
I can't tell."</p>

<p>"Oh, can't you? And even when you know that when you struck her
that brutal vicious blow with that camera&mdash;these two hairs
caught there and held."</p>

<p>"But I didn't strike her any vicious blow," insisted Clyde, now
observing Jephson&mdash;"and I can't say." He was saying to himself
that he would not allow himself to be bullied in this way by this
man&mdash;yet, at the same time, feeling very weak and sick. And
Mason, triumphant because of the psychologic effect, if nothing
more, returning the camera and lock to the table and remarking,
"Well, it's been amply testified to that those two hairs were in
that camera when found in the water. And you yourself swear that it
was last in your hands before it reached the water."</p>

<p>He turned to think of something else&mdash;some new point with
which to rack Clyde and now began once more:</p>

<p>"Griffiths, in regard to that trip south through the woods, what
time was it when you got to Three Mile Bay?"</p>

<p>"About four in the morning, I think&mdash;just before dawn."</p>

<p>"And what did you do between then and the time that boat down
there left?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I walked around."</p>

<p>"In Three Mile Bay?"</p>

<p>"No, sir&mdash;just outside of it."</p>

<p>"In the woods, I suppose, waiting for the town to wake up so you
wouldn't look so much out of place. Was that it?"</p>

<p>"Well, I waited until after the sun came up. Besides I was tired
and I sat down and rested for a while."</p>

<p>"Did you sleep well and did you have pleasant dreams?"</p>

<p>"I was tired and I slept a little&mdash;yes."</p>

<p>"And how was it you knew so much about the boat and the time and
all about Three Mile Bay? Hadn't you familiarized yourself with
this data beforehand?"</p>

<p>"Well, everybody knows about the boat from Sharon to Three Mile
Bay around there."</p>

<p>"Oh, do they? Any other reason?"</p>

<p>"Well, in looking for a place to get married, both of us saw
it," returned Clyde, shrewdly, "but we didn't see that any train
went to it. Only to Sharon."</p>

<p>"But you did notice that it was south of Big Bittern?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes&mdash;I guess I did," replied Clyde.</p>

<p>"And that that road west of Gun Lodge led south toward it around
the lower edge of Big Bittern?"</p>

<p>"Well, I noticed after I got up there that there was a road of
some kind or a trail anyhow&mdash;but I didn't think of it as a
regular road."</p>

<p>"I see. How was it then that when you met those three men in the
woods you were able to ask them how far it was to Three Mile
Bay?"</p>

<p>"I didn't ask 'em that," replied Clyde, as he had been
instructed by Jephson to say. "I asked 'em if they knew any road to
Three Mile Bay, and how far it was. I didn't know whether that was
the road or not."</p>

<p>"Well, that wasn't how they testified here."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't care what they testified to, that's what I asked
'em just the same."</p>

<p>"It seems to me that according to you all the witnesses are
liars and you are the only truthful one in the bunch...Isn't that
it? But, when you reached Three Mile Bay, did you stop to eat? You
must have been hungry, weren't you?"</p>

<p>"No, I wasn't hungry," replied Clyde, simply.</p>

<p>"You wanted to get away from that place as quickly as possible,
wasn't that it? You were afraid that those three men might go up to
Big Bittern and having heard about Miss Alden, tell about having
seen you&mdash;wasn't that it?"</p>

<p>"No, that wasn't it. But I didn't want to stay around there.
I've said why."</p>

<p>"I see. But after you got down to Sharon where you felt a little
more safe&mdash;a little further away, you didn't lose any time in
eating, did you? It tasted pretty good all right down there, didn't
it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know about that. I had a cup of coffee and a
sandwich."</p>

<p>"And a piece of pie, too, as we've already proved here," added
Mason. "And after that you joined the crowd coming up from the
depot as though you had just come up from Albany, as you afterwards
told everybody. Wasn't that it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, that was it."</p>

<p>"Well, now for a really innocent man who only so recently
experienced a kindly change of heart, don't you think you were
taking an awful lot of precaution? Hiding away like that and
waiting in the dark and pretending that you had just come up from
Albany."</p>

<p>"I've explained all that," persisted Clyde.</p>

<p>Mason's next tack was to hold Clyde up to shame for having been
willing, in the face of all she had done for him, to register
Roberta in three different hotel registers as the unhallowed
consort of presumably three different men in three different
days.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you take separate rooms?"</p>

<p>"Well, she didn't want it that way. She wanted to be with me.
Besides I didn't have any too much money."</p>

<p>"Even so, how could you have so little respect for her there,
and then be so deeply concerned about her reputation after she was
dead that you had to run away and keep the secret of her death all
to yourself, in order, as you say, to protect her name and
reputation?"</p>

<p>"Your Honor," interjected Belknap, "this isn't a question. It's
an oration."</p>

<p>"I withdraw the question," countered Mason, and then went on.
"Do you admit, by the way, that you are a mental and moral coward,
Griffiths&mdash;do you?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. I don't."</p>

<p>"You do not?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"Then when you lie, and swear to it, you are just the same as
any other person who is not a mental and moral coward, and
deserving of all the contempt and punishment due a person who is a
perjurer and a false witness. Is that correct?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. I suppose so."</p>

<p>"Well, if you are not a mental and moral coward, how can you
justify your leaving that girl in that lake&mdash;after as you say
you accidentally struck her and when you knew how her parents would
soon be suffering because of her loss&mdash;and not say one word to
anybody&mdash;just walk off&mdash;and hide the tripod and your suit
and sneak away like an ordinary murderer? Wouldn't you think that
that was the conduct of a man who had plotted and executed murder
and was trying to get away with it&mdash;if you had heard of it
about some one else? Or would you think it was just the sly,
crooked trick of a man who was only a mental and moral coward and
who was trying to get away from the blame for the accidental death
of a girl whom he had seduced and news of which might interfere
with his prosperity? Which?"</p>

<p>"Well, I didn't kill her, just the same," insisted Clyde.</p>

<p>"Answer the question!" thundered Mason.</p>

<p>"I ask the court to instruct the witness that he need not answer
such a question," put in Jephson, rising and fixing first Clyde and
then Oberwaltzer with his eye. "It is purely an argumentative one
and has no real bearing on the facts in this case."</p>

<p>"I so instruct," replied Oberwaltzer. "The witness need not
answer." Whereupon Clyde merely stared, greatly heartened by this
unexpected aid.</p>

<p>"Well, to go on," proceeded Mason, now more nettled and annoyed
than ever by this watchful effort on the part of Belknap and
Jephson to break the force and significance of his each and every
attack, and all the more determined not to be outdone&mdash;"you
say you didn't intend to marry her if you could help it, before you
went up there?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"That she wanted you to but you hadn't made up your mind?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well, do you recall the cook-book and the salt and pepper
shakers and the spoons and knives and so on that she put in her
bag?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. I do."</p>

<p>"What do you suppose she had in mind when she left
Biltz&mdash;with those things in her trunk&mdash;that she was going
out to live in some hall bedroom somewhere, unmarried, while you
came to see her once a week or once a month?"</p>

<p>Before Belknap could object, Clyde shot back the proper
answer.</p>

<p>"I can't say what she had in her mind about that."</p>

<p>"You couldn't possibly have told her over the telephone there at
Biltz, for instance&mdash;after she wrote you that if you didn't
come for her she was coming to Lycurgus&mdash;that you would marry
her?"</p>

<p>"No, sir&mdash;I didn't."</p>

<p>"You weren't mental and moral coward enough to be bullied into
anything like that, were you?"</p>

<p>"I never said I was a mental and moral coward."</p>

<p>"But you weren't to be bullied by a girl you had seduced?"</p>

<p>"Well, I couldn't feel then that I ought to marry her."</p>

<p>"You didn't think she'd make as good a match as Miss X?"</p>

<p>"I didn't think I ought to marry her if I didn't love her any
more."</p>

<p>"Not even to save her honor&mdash;and your own decency?"</p>

<p>"Well, I didn't think we could be happy together then."</p>

<p>"That was before your great change of heart, I suppose."</p>

<p>"It was before we went to Utica, yes."</p>

<p>"And while you were still so enraptured with Miss X?"</p>

<p>"I was in love with Miss X&mdash;yes."</p>

<p>"Do you recall, in one of those letters to you that you never
answered" (and here Mason proceeded to take up and read from one of
the first seven letters), "her writing this to you; 'I feel upset
and uncertain about everything although I try not to feel
so&mdash;now that we have our plan and you are going to come for me
as you said.' Now just what was she referring to there when she
wrote&mdash; 'now that we have our plan'?"</p>

<p>"I don't know unless it was that I was coming to get her and
take her away somewhere temporarily."</p>

<p>"Not to marry her, of course."</p>

<p>"No, I hadn't said so."</p>

<p>"But right after that in this same letter she says: 'On the way
up, instead of coming straight home, I decided to stop at Homer to
see my sister and brother-in-law, since I am not sure now when I'll
see them again, and I want so much that they shall see me
respectable or never at all any more.' Now just what do you
suppose, she meant by that word 'respectable'? Living somewhere in
secret and unmarried and having a child while you sent her a little
money, and then coming back maybe and posing as single and innocent
or married and her husband dead&mdash;or what? Don't you suppose
she saw herself married to you, for a time at least, and the child
given a name? That 'plan' she mentions couldn't have contemplated
anything less than that, could it?"</p>

<p>"Well, maybe as she saw it it couldn't," evaded Clyde. "But I
never said I would marry her."</p>

<p>"Well, well&mdash;we'll let that rest a minute," went on Mason
doggedly. "But now take this," and here he began reading from the
tenth letter: "'It won't make any difference to you about your
coming a few days sooner than you intended, will it, dear? Even if
we have got to get along on a little less, I know we can, for the
time I will be with you anyhow, probably no more than six or eight
months at the most. I agreed to let you go by then, you know, if
you want to. I can be very saving and economical. It can't be any
other way now, Clyde, although for your own sake I wish it could.'
What do you suppose all that means&mdash;'saving and
economical'&mdash;and not letting you go until after eight months?
Living in a hall bedroom and you coming to see her once a week? Or
hadn't you really agreed to go away with her and marry her, as she
seems to think here?"</p>

<p>"I don't know unless she thought she could make me, maybe,"
replied Clyde, the while various backwoodsmen and farmers and
jurors actually sniffed and sneered, so infuriated were they by the
phrase "make me" which Clyde had scarcely noticed. "I never agreed
to."</p>

<p>"Unless she could make you. So that was the way you felt about
it, was it, Griffiths?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"You'd swear to that as quick as you would to anything
else?"</p>

<p>"Well, I have sworn to it."</p>

<p>And Mason as well as Belknap and Jephson and Clyde himself now
felt the strong public contempt and rage that the majority of those
present had for him from the start&mdash;now surging and shaking
all. It filled the room. Yet before him were all the hours Mason
needed in which he could pick and choose at random from the mass of
testimony as to just what he would quiz and bedevil and torture
Clyde with next. And so now, looking over his notes&mdash;arranged
fan-wise on the table by Earl Newcomb for his convenience&mdash;he
now began once more with:</p>

<p>"Griffiths, in your testimony here yesterday, through which you
were being led by your counsel, Mr. Jephson" (at this Jephson bowed
sardonically), "you talked about that change of heart that you
experienced after you encountered Roberta Alden once more at Fonda
and Utica back there in July&mdash;just as you were starting on
this death trip."</p>

<p>Clyde's "yes, sir," came before Belknap could object, but the
latter managed to have "death trip" changed to "trip."</p>

<p>"Before going up there with her you hadn't been liking her as
much as you might have. Wasn't that the way of it?"</p>

<p>"Not as much as I had at one time&mdash;no, sir."</p>

<p>"And just how long&mdash;from when to when&mdash;was the time in
which you really did like her, before you began to dislike her, I
mean?"</p>

<p>"Well, from the time I first met her until I met Miss X."</p>

<p>"But not afterwards?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I can't say not entirely afterwards. I cared for her
some&mdash; a good deal, I guess&mdash;but still not as much as I
had. I felt more sorry for her than anything else, I suppose."</p>

<p>"And now, let's see&mdash;that was between December first last
say, and last April or May&mdash;or wasn't it?"</p>

<p>"About that time, I think&mdash;yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, during that time&mdash;December first to April or May
first you were intimate with her, weren't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Even though you weren't caring for her so much."</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;yes, sir," replied Clyde, hesitating slightly, while
the rurals jerked and craned at this introduction of the sex
crime.</p>

<p>"And yet at nights, and in spite of the fact that she was alone
over there in her little room&mdash;as faithful to you, as you
yourself have testified, as any one could be&mdash;you went off to
dances, parties, dinners, and automobile rides, while she sat
there."</p>

<p>"Oh, but I wasn't off all the time."</p>

<p>"Oh, weren't you? But you heard the testimony of Tracy and Jill
Trumbull, and Frederick Sells, and Frank Harriet, and Burchard
Taylor, on this particular point, didn't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, were they all liars, or were they telling the truth?"</p>

<p>"Well, they were telling the truth as near as they could
remember, I suppose."</p>

<p>"But they couldn't remember very well&mdash;is that it?"</p>

<p>"Well, I wasn't off all the time. Maybe I was gone two or three
times a week&mdash;maybe four sometimes&mdash;not more."</p>

<p>"And the rest you gave to Miss Alden?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Is that what she meant in this letter here?" And here he took
up another letter from the pile of Roberta's letters, and opening
it and holding it before him, read: "'Night after night, almost
every night after that dreadful Christmas day when you left me, I
was alone nearly always.' Is she lying, or isn't she?" snapped
Mason fiercely, and Clyde, sensing the danger of accusing Roberta
of lying here, weakly and shamefacedly replied: "No, she isn't
lying. But I did spend some evenings with her just the same."</p>

<p>"And yet you heard Mrs. Gilpin and her husband testify here that
night after night from December first on Miss Alden was mostly
always alone in her room and that they felt sorry for her and
thought it so unnatural and tried to get her to join them, but she
wouldn't. You heard them testify to that, didn't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"And yet you insist that you were with her some?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Yet at the same time loving and seeking the company of Miss
X?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"And trying to get her to marry you?"</p>

<p>"I wanted her to&mdash;yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Yet continuing relations with Miss Alden when your other
interests left you any time."</p>

<p>"Well...yes, sir," once more hesitated Clyde, enormously
troubled by the shabby picture of his character which these
disclosures seemed to conjure, yet somehow feeling that he was not
as bad, or at least had not intended to be, as all this made him
appear. Other people did things like that too, didn't
they&mdash;those young men in Lycurgus society&mdash;or they had
talked as though they did.</p>

<p>"Well, don't you think your learned counsel found a very mild
term for you when they described you as a mental and moral coward?"
sneered Mason&mdash;and at the same time from the rear of the long
narrow courtroom, a profound silence seeming to precede, accompany
and follow it,&mdash;yet not without an immediate roar of protest
from Belknap, came the solemn, vengeful voice of an irate woodsman:
"Why don't they kill the God-damned bastard and be done with
him?"&mdash; And at once Oberwaltzer gaveling for order and
ordering the arrest of the offender at the same time that he
ordered all those not seated driven from the courtroom&mdash;which
was done. And then the offender arrested and ordered arraigned on
the following morning. And after that, silence, with Mason once
more resuming:</p>

<p>"Griffiths, you say when you left Lycurgus you had no intention
of marrying Roberta Alden unless you could not arrange in any other
way."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. That was my intention at that time."</p>

<p>"And accordingly you were fairly certain of coming back?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir&mdash;I thought I was."</p>

<p>"Then why did you pack everything in your room in your trunk and
lock it?"</p>

<p>"Well...well...that is," hesitated Clyde, the charge coming so
quickly and so entirely apart from what had just been spoken of
before that he had scarcely time to collect his wits&mdash;"well,
you see&mdash;I wasn't absolutely sure. I didn't know but what I
might have to go whether I wanted to or not."</p>

<p>"I see. And so if you had decided up there unexpectedly as you
did&mdash;" (and here Mason smirked on him as much as to
say&mdash;you think any one believes that?) "you wouldn't have had
time to come back and decently pack your things and depart?"</p>

<p>"Well, no, sir&mdash;that wasn't the reason either."</p>

<p>"Well then, what was the reason?"</p>

<p>"Well, you see," and here for lack of previous thought on this
subject as well as lack of wit to grasp the essentiality of a
suitable and plausible answer quickly, Clyde hesitated&mdash;as
every one&mdash;first and foremost Belknap and
Jephson&mdash;noted&mdash;and then went on: "Well, you see&mdash;if
I had to go away, even for a short time as I thought I might, I
decided that I might need whatever I had in a hurry."</p>

<p>"I see. You're quite sure it wasn't that in case the police
discovered who Clifford Golden or Carl Graham were, that you might
wish to leave quickly?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. It wasn't."</p>

<p>"And so you didn't tell Mrs. Peyton you were giving up the room
either, did you?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"In your testimony the other day you said something about not
having money enough to go up there and take Miss Alden away on any
temporary marriage scheme&mdash;even one that would last so long as
six months."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"When you left Lycurgus to start on the trip, how much did you
have?"</p>

<p>"About fifty dollars."</p>

<p>"'About' fifty? Don't you know exactly how much you had?"</p>

<p>"I had fifty dollars&mdash;yes, sir."</p>

<p>"And while you were in Utica and Grass Lake and getting down to
Sharon afterwards, how much did you spend?"</p>

<p>"I spent about twenty dollars on the trip, I think."</p>

<p>"Don't you know?"</p>

<p>"Not exactly&mdash;no, sir&mdash;somewhere around twenty
dollars, though."</p>

<p>"Well, now let's see about that exactly if we can," went on
Mason, and here, once more, Clyde began to sense a trap and grew
nervous&mdash; for there was all that money given him by Sondra and
some of which he had spent, too. "How much was your fare from Fonda
to Utica for yourself?"</p>

<p>"A dollar and a quarter."</p>

<p>"And what did you have to pay for your room at the hotel at
Utica for you and Roberta?"</p>

<p>"That was four dollars."</p>

<p>"And of course you had dinner that night and breakfast the next
morning, which cost you how much?"</p>

<p>"It was about three dollars for both meals."</p>

<p>"Was that all you spent in Utica?" Mason was taking a side
glance occasionally at a slip of paper on which he had figures and
notes, but which Clyde had not noticed.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"How about the straw hat that it has been proved you purchased
while there?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, sir, I forgot about that," said Clyde, nervously.
"That was two dollars&mdash;yes, sir." He realized that he must be
more careful.</p>

<p>"And your fares to Grass Lake were, of course, five dollars. Is
that right?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Then you hired a boat at Grass Lake. How much was that?"</p>

<p>"That was thirty-five cents an hour."</p>

<p>"And you had it how long?"</p>

<p>"Three hours."</p>

<p>"Making one dollar and five cents."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"And then that night at the hotel, they charged you how much?
Five dollars, wasn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"And then didn't you buy that lunch that you carried out in that
lake with you up there?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. I think that was about sixty cents."</p>

<p>"And how much did it cost you to get to Big Bittern?"</p>

<p>"It was a dollar on the train to Gun Lodge and a dollar on the
bus for the two of us to Big Bittern."</p>

<p>"You know these figures pretty well, I see. Naturally, you
would. You didn't have much money and it was important. And how
much was your fare from Three Mile Bay to Sharon afterwards?"</p>

<p>"My fare was seventy-five cents."</p>

<p>"Did you ever stop to figure this all up exactly?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, will you?"</p>

<p>"Well, you know how much it is, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I do. It was twenty-four dollars and sixty-five
cents. You said you spent twenty dollars. But here is a discrepancy
of four dollars and sixty-five cents. How do you account for
it?"</p>

<p>"Well, I suppose I didn't figure just exactly right," said
Clyde, irritated by the accuracy of figures such as these.</p>

<p>But now Mason slyly and softly inquiring: "Oh, yes, Griffiths, I
forgot, how much was the boat you hired at Big Bittern?" He was
eager to hear what Clyde would have to say as to this, seeing that
he had worked hard and long on this pitfall.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;ah&mdash;ah&mdash;that is," began Clyde, hesitatingly,
for at Big Bittern, as he now recalled, he had not even troubled to
inquire the cost of the boat, feeling as he did at the time that
neither he nor Roberta were coming back. But now here and in this
way it was coming up for the first time. And Mason, realizing that
he had caught him here, quickly interpolated a "Yes?" to which
Clyde replied, but merely guessing at that: "Why, thirty-five cents
an hour&mdash;just the same as at Grass Lake&mdash;so the boatman
said."</p>

<p>But he had spoken too quickly. And he did not know that in
reserve was the boatman who was still to testify that he had not
stopped to ask the price of the boat. And Mason continued:</p>

<p>"Oh, it was, was it? The boatman told you that, did he?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Well now, don't you recall that you never asked the boatman at
all? It was not thirty-five cents an hour, but fifty cents. But of
course you do not know that because you were in such a hurry to get
out on the water and you did not expect to have to come back and
pay for it anyway. So you never even asked, you see. Do you see? Do
you recall that now?" And here Mason produced a bill that he had
gotten from the boatman and waved it in front of Clyde. "It was
fifty cents an hour," he repeated. "They charge more than at Grass
Lake. But what I want to know is, if you are so familiar with these
other figures, as you have just shown that you are, how comes it
that you are not familiar with this figure? Didn't you think of the
expense of taking her out in a boat and keeping the boat from noon
until night?" The attack came so swiftly and bitterly that at once
Clyde was confused. He twisted and turned, swallowed and looked
nervously at the floor, ashamed to look at Jephson who had somehow
failed to coach him as to this.</p>

<p>"Well," bawled Mason, "any explanation to make as to that?
Doesn't it strike even you as strange that you can remember every
other item of all your expenditures&mdash;but not that item?" And
now each juror was once more tense and leaning forward. And Clyde
noting their interest and curiosity, and most likely suspicion, now
returned:</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know just how I came to forget that."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, of course you don't," snorted Mason. "A man who is
planning to kill a girl on a lone lake has a lot of things to think
of, and it isn't any wonder if you forget a few of them. But you
didn't forget to ask the purser the fare to Sharon, once you got to
Three Mile Bay, did you?"</p>

<p>"I don't remember if I did or not."</p>

<p>"Well, he remembers. He testified to it here. You bothered to
ask the price of the room at Grass Lake. You asked the price of the
boat there. You even asked the price of the bus fare to Big
Bittern. What a pity you couldn't think to ask the price of the
boat at Big Bittern? You wouldn't be so nervous about it now, would
you?" and here Mason looked at the jurors as much as to say: You
see!</p>

<p>"I just didn't think of it, I guess," repeated Clyde.</p>

<p>"A very satisfactory explanation, I'm sure," went on Mason,
sarcastically. And then as swiftly as possible: "I don't suppose
you happen to recall an item of thirteen dollars and twenty cents
paid for a lunch at the Casino on July ninth&mdash;the day after
Roberta Alden's death&mdash;do you or do you not?" Mason was
dramatic, persistent, swift&mdash;scarcely giving him time to think
or breathe, as he saw it.</p>

<p>At this Clyde almost jumped, so startled was he by this question
and charge, for he did not know that they had found out about the
lunch. "And do you remember, too," went on Mason, "that over eighty
dollars was found on you when you were arrested?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I remember it now," he replied.</p>

<p>As for the eighty dollars he had forgotten. Yet now he said
nothing, for he could not think what to say.</p>

<p>"How about that?" went on Mason, doggedly and savagely. "If you
only had fifty dollars when you left Lycurgus and over eighty
dollars when you were arrested, and you spent twenty-four dollars
and sixty-five cents plus thirteen for a lunch, where did you get
that extra money from?"</p>

<p>"Well, I can't answer that just now," replied Clyde, sullenly,
for he felt cornered and hurt. That was Sondra's money and nothing
would drag out of him where he had gotten it.</p>

<p>"Why can't you answer it?" roared Mason. "Where do you think you
are, anyhow? And what do you think we are here for? To say what you
will or will not answer? You are on trial for your life&mdash;don't
forget that! You can't play fast and loose with law, however much
you may have lied to me. You are here before these twelve men and
they are waiting to know. Now, what about it? Where did you get
that money?"</p>

<p>"I borrowed it from a friend."</p>

<p>"Well, give his name. What friend?"</p>

<p>"I don't care to</p>

<p>"Oh, you don't! Well, you're lying about the amount of money you
had when you left Lycurgus&mdash;that's plain. And under oath, too.
Don't forget that! That sacred oath that you respect so much. Isn't
that true?"</p>

<p>"No, it isn't," finally observed Clyde, stung to reason by this
charge. "I borrowed that money after I got to Twelfth Lake."</p>

<p>"And from whom?"</p>

<p>"Well, I can't say."</p>

<p>"Which makes the statement worthless," retorted Mason.</p>

<p>Clyde was beginning to show a disposition to balk. He had been
sinking his voice and each time Mason commanded him to speak up and
turn around so the jury could see his face, he had done so, only
feeling more and more resentful toward this man who was thus trying
to drag out of him every secret he possessed. He had touched on
Sondra, and she was still too near his heart to reveal anything
that would reflect on her. So now he sat staring down at the jurors
somewhat defiantly, when Mason picked up some pictures.</p>

<p>"Remember these?" he now asked Clyde, showing him some of the
dim and water-marked reproductions of Roberta besides some views of
Clyde and some others&mdash;none of them containing the face of
Sondra&mdash; which were made at the Cranstons' on his first visit,
as well as four others made at Bear Lake later, and with one of
them showing him holding a banjo, his fingers in position. "Recall
where these were made?" asked Mason, showing him the reproduction
of Roberta first.</p>

<p>"Yes, I do."</p>

<p>"Where was it?"</p>

<p>"On the south shore of Big Bittern the day we were there." He
knew that they were in the camera and had told Belknap and Jephson
about them, yet now he was not a little surprised to think that
they had been able to develop them.</p>

<p>"Griffiths," went on Mason, "your lawyers didn't tell you that
they fished and fished for that camera you swore you didn't have
with you before they found that I had it, did they?"</p>

<p>"They never said anything to me about it," replied Clyde.</p>

<p>"Well, that's too bad. I could have saved them a lot of trouble.
Well, these were the photos that were found in that camera and that
were made just after that change of heart you experienced, you
remember?"</p>

<p>"I remember when they were made," replied Clyde, sullenly.</p>

<p>"Well, they were made before you two went out in that boat for
the last time&mdash;before you finally told her whatever it was you
wanted to tell her&mdash;before she was murdered out there&mdash;at
a time when, as you have testified, she was very sad."</p>

<p>"No, that was the day before," defied Clyde.</p>

<p>"Oh, I see. Well, anyhow, these pictures look a little cheerful
for one who was as depressed as you say she was."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;but&mdash;she wasn't nearly as depressed then as she
was the day before," flashed Clyde, for this was the truth and he
remembered it.</p>

<p>"I see. But just the same, look at these other pictures. These
three here, for instance. Where were they made?"</p>

<p>"At the Cranston Lodge on Twelfth Lake, I think."</p>

<p>"Right. And that was June eighteenth or nineteenth, wasn't
it?"</p>

<p>"On the nineteenth, I think."</p>

<p>"Well, now, do you recall a letter Roberta wrote you on the
nineteenth?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"You don't recall any particular one?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"But they were all very sad, you have said."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir&mdash;they were."</p>

<p>"Well, this is that letter written at the time these pictures
were made." He turned to the jury.</p>

<p>"I would like the jury to look at these pictures and then listen
to just one passage from this letter written by Miss Alden to this
defendant on the same day. He has admitted that he was refusing to
write or telephone her, although he was sorry for her," he said,
turning to the jury. And here he opened a letter and read a long
sad plea from Roberta. "And now here are four more pictures,
Griffiths." And he handed Clyde the four made at Bear Lake. "Very
cheerful, don't you think? Not much like pictures of a man who has
just experienced a great change of heart after a most terrific
period of doubt and worry and evil conduct&mdash;and has just seen
the woman whom he had most cruelly wronged, but whom he now
proposed to do right by, suddenly drowned. They look as though you
hadn't a care in the world, don't they?"</p>

<p>"Well, they were just group pictures. I couldn't very well keep
out of them."</p>

<p>"But this one in the water here. Didn't it trouble you the least
bit to go in the water the second or third day after Roberta Alden
had sunk to the bottom of Big Bittern, and especially when you had
experienced such an inspiring change of heart in regard to
her?"</p>

<p>"I didn't want any one to know I had been up there with
her."</p>

<p>"We know all about that. But how about this banjo picture here.
Look at this!" And he held it out. "Very gay, isn't it?" he
snarled. And now Clyde, dubious and frightened, replied:</p>

<p>"But I wasn't enjoying myself just the same!"</p>

<p>"Not when you were playing the banjo here? Not when you were
playing golf and tennis with your friends the very next day after
her death? Not when you were buying and eating thirteen-dollar
lunches? Not when you were with Miss X again, and where you
yourself testified that you preferred to be?"</p>

<p>Mason's manner was snarling, punitive, sinister, bitterly
sarcastic.</p>

<p>"Well, not just then, anyhow&mdash;no, sir."</p>

<p>"What do you mean&mdash;'not just then'? Weren't you where you
wanted to be?"</p>

<p>"Well, in one way I was&mdash;certainly," replied Clyde,
thinking of what Sondra would think when she read this, as
unquestionably she would. Quite everything of all this was being
published in the papers every day. He could not deny that he was
with her and that he wanted to be with her. At the same time he had
not been happy. How miserably unhappy he had been, enmeshed in that
shameful and brutal plot! But now he must explain in some way so
that Sondra, when she should read it, and this jury, would
understand. And so now he added, while he swallowed with his dry
throat and licked his lips with his dry tongue: "But I was sorry
about Miss Alden just the same. I couldn't be happy then&mdash;I
couldn't be. I was just trying to make people think that I hadn't
had anything to do with her going up there&mdash;that's all. I
couldn't see that there was any better way to do. I didn't want to
be arrested for what I hadn't done."</p>

<p>"Don't you know that is false! Don't you know you are lying!"
shouted Mason, as though to the whole world, and the fire and the
fury of his unbelief and contempt was sufficient to convince the
jury, as well as the spectators, that Clyde was the most
unmitigated of liars. "You heard the testimony of Rufus Martin, the
second cook up there at Bear Lake?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"You heard him swear that he saw you and Miss X at a certain
point overlooking Bear Lake and that she was in your arms and that
you were kissing her. Was that true?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"And that exactly four days after you had left Roberta Alden
under the waters of Big Bittern. Were you afraid of being arrested
then?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Even when you were kissing her and holding her in your
arms?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied Clyde drearily and hopelessly.</p>

<p>"Well, of all things!" bawled Mason. "Could you imagine such
stuff being whimpered before a jury, if you hadn't heard it with
your own ears? Do you really sit there and swear to this jury that
you could bill and coo with one deceived girl in your arms and a
second one in a lake a hundred miles away, and yet be miserable
because of what you were doing?"</p>

<p>"Just the same, that's the way it was," replied Clyde.</p>

<p>"Excellent! Incomparable," shouted Mason.</p>

<p>And here he wearily and sighfully drew forth his large white
handkerchief once more and surveying the courtroom at large
proceeded to mop his face as much as to say: Well, this is a task
indeed, then continuing with more force than ever:</p>

<p>"Griffiths, only yesterday on the witness stand you swore that
you personally had no plan to go to Big Bittern when you left
Lycurgus."</p>

<p>"No, sir, I hadn't."</p>

<p>"But when you two got in that room at the Renfrew House in Utica
and you saw how tired she looked, it was you that suggested that a
vacation of some kind&mdash;a little one&mdash;something within the
range of your joint purses at the time&mdash;would be good for her.
Wasn't that the way of it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. That was the way of it," replied Clyde.</p>

<p>"But up to that time you hadn't even thought of the Adirondacks
specifically."</p>

<p>"Well, no sir&mdash;no particular lake, that is. I did think we
might go to some summer place maybe&mdash;they're mostly lakes
around there&mdash; but not to any particular one that I knew
of."</p>

<p>"I see. And after you suggested it, it was she that said that
you had better get some folders or maps, wasn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"And then it was that you went downstairs and got them?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"At the Renfrew House in Utica?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Not anywhere else by any chance?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"And afterwards, in looking over those maps, you saw Grass Lake
and Big Bittern and decided to go up that way. Was that the way of
it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, we did," lied Clyde, most nervously, wishing now that he
had not testified that it was in the Renfrew House that he had
secured the folders. There might be some trap here again.</p>

<p>"You and Miss Alden?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"And you picked on Grass Lake as being the best because it was
the cheapest. Wasn't that the way of it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. That was the way."</p>

<p>"I see. And now do you remember these?" he added, reaching over
and taking from his table a series of folders all properly
identified as part and parcel of the contents of Clyde's bag at
Bear Lake at the time he was arrested and which he now placed in
Clyde's hands. "Look them over. Are those the folders I found in
your bag at Bear Lake?"</p>

<p>"Well, they look like the ones I had there."</p>

<p>"Are these the ones you found in the rack at the Renfrew House
and took upstairs to show Miss Alden?"</p>

<p>Not a little terrified by the care with which this matter of
folders was now being gone into by Mason, Clyde opened them and
turned them over. Even now, because the label of the Lycurgus House
("Compliments of Lycurgus House, Lycurgus, N. Y.") was stamped in
red very much like the printed red lettering on the rest of the
folder, he failed to notice it at first. He turned and turned them
over, and then having decided that there was no trap here,
replied:</p>

<p>"Yes, I think these are the ones."</p>

<p>"Well, now," went on Mason, slyly, "in which one of these was it
that you found that notice of Grass Lake Inn and the rate they
charged up there? Wasn't it in this one?" And here he returned the
identical stamped folder, on one page of which&mdash;and the same
indicated by Mason's left forefinger&mdash;was the exact notice to
which Clyde had called Roberta's attention. Also in the center was
a map showing the Indian Chain together with Twelfth, Big Bittern,
and Grass Lakes, as well as many others, and at the bottom of this
map a road plainly indicated as leading from Grass Lake and Gun
Lodge south past the southern end of Big Bittern to Three Mile Bay.
Now seeing this after so long a time again, he suddenly decided
that it must be his knowledge of this road that Mason was seeking
to establish, and a little quivery and creepy now, he replied:
"Yes, it may be the one. It looks like it. I guess it is,
maybe."</p>

<p>"Don't you know that it is?" insisted Mason, darkly and dourly.
"Can't you tell from reading that item there whether it is or
not?"</p>

<p>"Well, it looks like it," replied Clyde, evasively after
examining the item which had inclined him toward Grass Lake in the
first place. "I suppose maybe it is."</p>

<p>"You suppose! You suppose! Getting a little more cautious now
that we're getting down to something practical. Well, just look at
that map there again and tell me what you see. Tell me if you don't
see a road marked as leading south from Grass Lake."</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Clyde, a little sullenly and bitterly after a
time, so flayed and bruised was he by this man who was so
determined to harry him to his grave. He fingered the map and
pretended to look as directed, but was seeing only all that he had
seen long before there in Lycurgus, so shortly before he departed
for Fonda to meet Roberta. And now here it was being used against
him.</p>

<p>"And where does it run, please? Do you mind telling the jury
where it runs&mdash;from where to where?"</p>

<p>And Clyde, nervous and fearful and physically very much reduced,
now replied: "Well, it runs from Grass Lake to Three Mile Bay."</p>

<p>"And to what or near what other places in between?" continued
Mason, looking over his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Gun Lodge. That's all."</p>

<p>"What about Big Bittern? Doesn't it run near that when it gets
to the south of it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, it does here."</p>

<p>"Ever notice or study that map before you went to Grass Lake
from Utica?" persisted Mason, tensely and, forcefully.</p>

<p>"No, sir&mdash;I did not."</p>

<p>"Never knew the road was on there?"</p>

<p>"Well, I may have seen it," replied Clyde, "but if so I didn't
pay any attention to it."</p>

<p>"And, of course, by no possible chance could you have seen or
studied this folder and that road before you left Utica?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. I never saw it before."</p>

<p>"I see. You're absolutely positive as to that?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. I am."</p>

<p>"Well then, explain to me, or to this jury, if you can, and
under your solemn oath which you respect so much, how it comes that
this particular folder chances to be marked, 'Compliments of the
Lycurgus House, Lycurgus, N. Y.'" And here he folded the folder and
presenting the back, showed Clyde the thin red stamp in between the
other red lettering. And Clyde, noting it, gazed as one in a
trance. His ultra-pale face now blanched gray again, his long thin
fingers opened and shut, the red and swollen and weary lids of his
eyes blinked and blinked to break the strain of the damning fact
before him.</p>

<p>"I don't know," he said, a little weakly, after a time. "It must
have been in the Renfrew House rack."</p>

<p>"Oh, must it? And if I bring two witnesses here to swear that on
July third&mdash;three days before you left Lycurgus for
Fonda&mdash;you were seen by them to enter the Lycurgus House and
take four or five folders from the rack there, will you still say
that it 'musta been in the rack at the Renfrew House' on July
sixth?" As he said this, Mason paused and looked triumphantly about
as much as to say: There, answer that if you can! and Clyde, shaken
and stiff and breathless for the time being was compelled to wait
at least fifteen seconds before he was able sufficiently to control
his nerves and voice in order to reply: "Well, it musta been. I
didn't get it in Lycurgus."</p>

<p>"Very good. But in the meantime we'll just let these gentlemen
here look at this," and he now turned the folder over to the
foreman of the jury, who in turn passed it to the juryman next to
him, and so on, the while a distinct whisper and buzz passed over
the entire courtroom.</p>

<p>And when they had concluded&mdash;and much to the surprise of
the audience, which was expecting more and more attacks and
exposures, almost without cessation&mdash;Mason turned and
explained: "That's all." And at once many of the spectators in the
room beginning to whisper: "Trapped! Trapped!" And Justice
Oberwaltzer at once announcing that because of the lateness of the
hour, and in the face of a number of additional witnesses for the
defense, as well as a few in rebuttal for the prosecution, he would
prefer it if the work for the day ended here. And both Belknap and
Mason gladly agreeing. And Clyde&mdash;the doors of the courtroom
being stoutly locked until he should be in his cell across the
way&mdash;being descended upon by Kraut and Sissel and by them led
through and down the very door and stairs which for days he had
been looking at and pondering about. And once he was gone, Belknap
and Jephson looking at each other but not saying anything until
once more safely locked in their own office, when Belknap began
with: "...not carried off with enough of an air. The best possible
defense but not enough courage. It just isn't in him, that's all."
And Jephson, flinging himself heavily into a chair, his overcoat
and hat still on, and saying: "No, that's the real trouble, no
doubt. It musta been that he really did kill her. But I suppose we
can't give up the ship now. He did almost better than I expected,
at that." And Belknap adding: "Well, I'll do my final best and
damnedest in my summing up, and that's all I can do." And Jephson
replying, a little wearily: "That's right, Alvin, it's mostly up to
you now, I'm sorry. But in the meantime, I think I'll go around to
the jail and try and hearten 'im up a bit. It won't do to let him
look too winged or lame tomorrow. He has to sit up and make the
jury feel that he, himself, feels that he isn't guilty whatever
they think." And rising he shoved his hands in the side pockets of
his long coat and proceeded through the winter's dark and cold of
the dreary town to see Clyde.</p>

<h3>Chapter 26</h3>

<p>The remainder of the trial consisted of the testimony of eleven
witnesses&mdash;four for Mason and seven for Clyde. One of the
latter&mdash; a Dr. A. K. Sword, of Rehobeth&mdash;chancing to be
at Big Bittern on the day that Roberta's body was returned to the
boat-house, now declared that he had seen and examined it there and
that the wounds, as they appeared then, did not seem to him as
other than such as might have been delivered by such a blow as
Clyde admitted to having struck accidentally, and that
unquestionably Miss Alden had been drowned while
conscious&mdash;and not unconscious, as the state would have the
jury believe&mdash;a result which led Mason into an inquiry
concerning the gentleman's medical history, which, alas, was not as
impressive as it might have been. He had been graduated from a
second-rate medical school in Oklahoma and had practised in a small
town ever since. In addition to him&mdash;and entirely apart from
the crime with which Clyde was charged&mdash;there was Samuel
Yearsley, one of the farmers from around Gun Lodge, who, driving
over the road which Roberta's body had traveled in being removed
from Big Bittern to Gun Lodge, now earnestly swore that the road,
as he had noticed in driving over it that same morning, was quite
rough&mdash;making it possible for Belknap, who was examining him,
to indicate that this was at least anapproximate cause of the
extra-severity of the wounds upon Roberta's head and face. This bit
of testimony was later contradicted, however, by a rival witness
for Mason&mdash;the driver for Lutz Brothers, no less, who as
earnestly swore that he found no ruts or rough places whatsoever in
the road. And again there were Liggett and Whiggam to say that in
so far as they had been able to note or determine, Clyde's conduct
in connection with his technical efforts for Griffiths &amp;
Company had been attentive, faithful and valuable. They had seen no
official harm in him. And then several other minor witnesses to say
that in so far as they had been able to observe his social comings
and goings, Clyde's conduct was most circumspect, ceremonious and
guarded. He had done no ill that they knew of. But, alas, as Mason
in cross-examining them was quick to point out, they had never
heard of Roberta Alden or her trouble or even of Clyde's social
relationship with her.</p>

<p>Finally many small and dangerous and difficult points having
been bridged or buttressed or fended against as well as each side
could, it became Belknap's duty to say his last word for Clyde. And
to this he gave an entire day, most carefully, and in the spirit of
his opening address, retracing and emphasizing every point which
tended to show how almost unconsciously, if not quite innocently,
Clyde had fallen into the relationship with Roberta which had ended
so disastrously for both. Mental and moral cowardice, as he now
reiterated, inflamed or at least operated on by various lacks in
Clyde's early life, plus new opportunities such as previously had
never appeared to be within his grasp, had affected his "perhaps
too pliable and sensual and impractical and dreamy mind." No doubt
he had not been fair to Miss Alden. No question as to that. He had
not. But on the other hand&mdash;and as had been most clearly shown
by the confession which the defense had elicited&mdash;he had not
proved ultimately so cruel or vile as the prosecution would have
the public and this honorable jury believe. Many men were far more
cruel in their love life than this young boy had ever dreamed of
being, and of course they were not necessarily hung for that. And
in passing technically on whether this boy had actually committed
the crime charged, it was incumbent upon this jury to see that no
generous impulse relating to what this poor girl might have
suffered in her love-relations with this youth be permitted to sway
them to the belief or decision that for that this youth had
committed the crime specifically stated in the indictment. Who
among both sexes were not cruel at times in their love life, the
one to the other?</p>

<p>And then a long and detailed indictment of the purely
circumstantial nature of the evidence&mdash;no single person having
seen or heard anything of the alleged crime itself, whereas Clyde
himself had explained most clearly how he came to find himself in
the peculiar situation in which he did find himself. And after
that, a brushing aside of the incident of the folder, as well as
Clyde's not remembering the price of the boat at Big Bittern, his
stopping to bury the tripod and his being so near Roberta and not
aiding her, as either being mere accidents of chance, or memory,
or, in the case of his failing to go to her rescue, of his being
dazed, confused, frightened&mdash;"hesitating fatally but not
criminally at the one time in his life when he should not have
hesitated"&mdash;a really strong if jesuitical plea which was not
without its merits and its weight.</p>

<p>And then Mason, blazing with his conviction that Clyde was a
murderer of the coldest and blackest type, and spending an entire
day in riddling the "spider's tissue of lies and unsupported
statements" with which the defense was hoping to divert the minds
of the jury from the unbroken and unbreakable chain of amply
substantiated evidence wherewith the prosecution had proved this
"bearded man" to be the "red-handed murderer" that he was. And with
hours spent in retracing the statements of the various witnesses.
And other hours in denouncing Clyde, or re-telling the bitter
miseries of Roberta&mdash;so much so that the jury, as well as the
audience, was once more on the verge of tears. And with Clyde
deciding in his own mind as he sat between Belknap and Jephson,
that no jury such as this was likely to acquit him in the face of
evidence so artfully and movingly recapitulated.</p>

<p>And then Oberwaltzer from his high seat finally instructing the
jury: "Gentlemen&mdash;all evidence is, in a strict sense, more or
less circumstantial, whether consisting of facts which permit the
inference of guilt or whether given by an eyewitness. The testimony
of an eyewitness is, of course, based upon circumstances.</p>

<p>"If any of the material facts of the case are at variance with
the probability of guilt, it will be the duty of you gentlemen to
give the defendant the benefit of the doubt raised.</p>

<p>"And it must be remembered that evidence is not to be
discredited or decried because it is circumstantial. It may often
be more reliable evidence than direct evidence.</p>

<p>"Much has been said here concerning motive and its importance in
this case, but you are to remember that proof of motive is by no
means indispensable or essential to conviction. While a motive may
be shown as a <i>circumstance</i> to aid in <i>fixing</i> a crime,
yet the people are not required to prove a motive.</p>

<p>"If the jury finds that Roberta Alden accidentally or
involuntarily fell out of the boat and that the defendant made no
attempt to rescue her, that does not make the defendant guilty and
the jury must find the defendant 'not guilty.' On the other hand,
if the jury finds that the defendant in any way, intentionally,
there and then brought about or contributed to that fatal accident,
either by a blow or otherwise, it must find the defendant
guilty.</p>

<p>"While I do not say that you must agree upon your verdict, I
would suggest that you ought not, any of you, place your minds in a
position which will not yield if after careful deliberation you
find you are wrong."</p>

<p>So, Justice Oberwaltzer&mdash;solemnly and didactically from his
high seat to the jury.</p>

<p>And then, that point having been reached, the jury rising and
filing from the room at five in the afternoon. And Clyde
immediately thereafter being removed to his cell before the
audience proper was allowed to leave the building. There was
constant fear on the part of the sheriff that he might be attacked.
And after that five long hours in which he waited, walking to and
fro, to and fro, in his cell, or pretending to read or rest, the
while Kraut or Sissel, tipped by various representatives of the
press for information as to how Clyde "took it" at this time, slyly
and silently remained as near as possible to watch.</p>

<p>And in the meantime Justice Oberwaltzer and Mason and Belknap
and Jephson, with their attendants and friends, in various rooms of
the Bridgeburg Central Hotel, dining and then waiting impatiently,
with the aid of a few drinks, for the jury to agree, and wishing
and hoping that the verdict would be reached soon, whatever it
might be.</p>

<p>And in the meantime the twelve men&mdash;farmers, clerks and
storekeepers, re-canvassing for their own mental satisfaction the
fine points made by Mason and Belknap and Jephson. Yet out of the
whole twelve but one man&mdash;Samuel Upham, a
druggist&mdash;(politically opposed to Mason and taken with the
personality of Jephson)&mdash;sympathizing with Belknap and
Jephson. And so pretending that he had doubts as to the
completeness of Mason's proof until at last after five ballots were
taken he was threatened with exposure and the public rage and
obloquy which was sure to follow in case the jury was hung. "We'll
fix you. You won't get by with this without the public knowing
exactly where you stand." Whereupon, having a satisfactory drug
business in North Mansfield, he at once decided that it was best to
pocket this opposition to Mason and agree.</p>

<p>Then four hollow knocks on the door leading from the jury room
to the courtroom. It was the foreman of the jury, Foster Lund, a
dealer in cement, lime and stone. His great fist was knocking. And
at that the hundreds who had crowded into the hot stuffy courtroom
after dinner though many had not even left&mdash;stirred from the
half stupor into which they had fallen. "What's that? What's
happened? Is the jury ready to report? What's the verdict?" And men
and women and children starting up to draw nearer the excluding
rail. And the two deputies on guard before the jury door beginning
to call. "All right! All right! As soon as the judge comes." And
then other deputies hurrying to the prison over the way in order
that the sheriff might be notified and Clyde brought over&mdash;
and to the Bridgeburg Central Hotel to summon Oberwaltzer and all
the others. And then Clyde, in a half stupor or daze from sheer
loneliness and killing suspense, being manacled to Kraut and led
over between Slack, Sissel and others. And Oberwaltzer, Mason,
Belknap and Jephson and the entire company of newspaper writers,
artists, photographers and others entering and taking the places
that they had occupied all these long weeks. And Clyde winking and
blinking as he was seated behind Belknap and Jephson now&mdash;not
with them, for as stoutly manacled as he was to Kraut, he was
compelled to sit by him. And then Oberwaltzer on the bench and the
clerk in his place, the jury room door being opened and the twelve
men filing solemnly in&mdash;quaint and varied figures in angular
and for the most part much-worn suits of the ready-made variety.
And as they did so, seating themselves in the jury box, only to
rise again at the command of the clerk, who began: "Gentlemen of
the jury, have you agreed on a verdict?"&mdash;yet without one of
them glancing in the direction of either Belknap or Jephson or
Clyde, which Belknap at once interpreted as fatal.</p>

<p>"It's all off," he whispered to Jephson. "Against us. I can
tell." And then Lund announcing: "We have. We find the defendant
guilty of murder in the first degree." And Clyde, entirely dazed
and yet trying to keep his poise and remain serene, gazing straight
before him toward the jury and beyond, and with scarcely a blink of
the eye. For had he not, in his cell the night before, been told by
Jephson, who had found him deeply depressed, that the verdict in
this trial, assuming that it proved to be unfavorable, was of no
consequence. The trial from start to finish had been unfair.
Prejudice and bias had governed its every step. Such bullying and
browbeating and innuendo as Mason had indulged in before the jury
would never pass as fair or adequate in any higher court. And a new
trial&mdash;on appeal&mdash;would certainly be
granted&mdash;although by whom such an appeal was to be conducted
he was not now prepared to discuss.</p>

<p>And now, recalling that, Clyde saying to himself that it did not
so much matter perhaps, after all. It could not, really&mdash;or
could it? Yet think what these words meant in case he could not get
a new trial! Death! That is what it would mean if this were
final&mdash;and perhaps it was final. And then to sit in that chair
he had seen in his mind's eye for so long&mdash;these many days and
nights when he could not force his mind to drive it away. Here it
was again before him&mdash;that dreadful, ghastly chair&mdash;only
closer and larger than ever before&mdash;there in the very center
of the space between himself and Justice Oberwaltzer. He could see
it plainly now&mdash; squarish, heavy-armed, heavy-backed, some
straps at the top and sides. God! Supposing no one would help him
now! Even the Griffiths might not be willing to pay out any more
money! Think of that! The Court of Appeals to which Jephson and
Belknap had referred might not be willing to help him either. And
then these words would be final. They would! They would! God! His
jaws moved slightly, then set&mdash;because at the moment he became
conscious that they were moving. Besides, at that moment Belknap
was rising and asking for an individual poll of the jury, while
Jephson leaned over and whispered: "Don't worry about it. It isn't
final. We'll get a reversal as sure as anything." Yet as each of
the jurors was saying: "Yes"&mdash;Clyde was listening to them, not
to Jephson. Why should each one say that with so much emphasis? Was
there not one who felt that he might not have done as Mason had
said&mdash;struck her intentionally? Was there not one who even
half-believed in that change of heart which Belknap and Jephson had
insisted that he had experienced? He looked at them
all&mdash;little and big. They were like a blackish-brown group of
wooden toys with creamish-brown or old ivory faces and hands. Then
he thought of his mother. She would hear of this now, for here were
all these newspaper writers and artists and photographers assembled
to hear this. And what would the Griffiths&mdash;his uncle and
Gilbert&mdash;think now? And Sondra! Sondra! Not a word from her.
And through all this he had been openly testifying, as Belknap and
Jcphson had agreed that he must do&mdash;to the compelling and
directing power of his passion for her&mdash; the real reason for
all this! But not a word. And she would not send him any word now,
of course&mdash;she who had been going to marry him and give him
everything!</p>

<p>But in the meantime the crowd about him silent although&mdash;or
perhaps because&mdash;intensely satisfied. The little devil hadn't
"gotten by." He hadn't fooled the twelve sane men of this county
with all that bunk about a change of heart. What rot! While Jephson
sat and stared, and Belknap, his strong face written all over with
contempt and defiance, making his motions. And Mason and Burleigh
and Newcomb and Redmond thinly repressing their intense
satisfaction behind masks preternaturally severe, the while Belknap
continued with a request that the sentence be put off until the
following Friday&mdash;a week hence, when he could more
conveniently attend, but with Justice Oberwaltzer replying that he
thought not&mdash;unless some good reason could be shown. But on
the morrow, if counsel desired, he would listen to an argument. If
it were satisfactory he would delay sentence&mdash;otherwise,
pronounce it the following Monday.</p>

<p>Yet, even so, Clyde was not concerned with this argument at the
moment. He was thinking of his mother and what she would
think&mdash; feel. He had been writing her so regularly, insisting
always that he was innocent and that she must not believe all, or
even a part, of what she read an the newspapers. He was going to be
acquitted sure. He was going to go on the stand and testify for
himself. But now...now...oh, he needed her now&mdash;so much. Quite
every one, as it seemed now, had forsaken him. He was terribly,
terribly alone. And he must send her some word quickly. He must. He
must. And then asking Jephson for a piece of paper and a pencil, he
wrote: "Mrs. Asa Griffiths, care of Star of Hope Mission, Denver,
Colorado. Dear mother&mdash;I am convicted&mdash;Clyde." And then
handing that to Jephson, he asked him, nervously and weakly, if he
would see that it was sent right away. "Right away, son, sure,"
replied Jephson, touched by his looks, and waving to a press boy
who was near gave it to him together with the money.</p>

<p>And then, while this was going on, all the public exits being
locked until Clyde, accompanied by Sissel and Kraut, had been
ushered through the familiar side entrance through which he had
hoped to escape. And while all the press and the public and the
still-remaining jury gazing, for even yet they had not seen enough
of Clyde but must stare into his face to see how he was taking it.
And because of the local feeling against him, Justice Oberwaltzer,
at Slack's request, holding court un-adjourned until word was
brought that Clyde was once more locked in his cell, whereupon the
doors were re-opened. And then the crowd surging out but only to
wait at the courtroom door in order to glimpse, as he passed out,
Mason, who now, of all the figures in this case, was the true
hero&mdash; the nemesis of Clyde&mdash;the avenger of Roberta. That
he not appearing at first but instead Jephson and Belknap together,
and not so much depressed as solemn, defiant&mdash;Jephson in
particular, looking unconquerably contemptuous. Then some one
calling: "Well, you didn't get him off just the same," and Jephson
replying, with a shrug of his shoulders, "Not yet, but this county
isn't all of the law either." Then Mason, immediately
afterward&mdash;a heavy, baggy overcoat thrown over his shoulder,
his worn soft hat pulled low over his eyes&mdash;and followed by
Burleigh, Heit, Newcomb and others as a royal train&mdash;while he
walked in the manner of one entirely oblivious of the meaning or
compliment of this waiting throng. For was he not now a victor and
an elected judge! And as instantly being set upon by a circling,
huzzahing mass&mdash;the while a score of those nearest sought to
seize him by the hand or place a grateful pat upon his arm or
shoulder. "Hurrah for Orville!" "Good for you, Judge!" (his new or
fast-approaching title). "By God! Orville Mason, you deserve the
thanks of this county!" "Hy-oh! Heigh! Heigh!" "Three cheers for
Orville Mason!" And with that the crowd bursting into three
resounding huzzahs&mdash;which Clyde in his cell could clearly hear
and at the same time sense the meaning of.</p>

<p>They were cheering Mason for convicting him. In that large crowd
out there there was not one who did not believe him totally and
completely guilty. Roberta&mdash;her letters&mdash;her
determination to make him marry her&mdash;her giant fear of
exposure&mdash;had dragged him down to this. To conviction. To
death, maybe. Away from all he had longed for&mdash;away from all
he had dreamed he might possess. And Sondra! Sondra! Not a word!
Not a word! And so now, fearing that Kraut or Sissel or some one
might be watching (ready to report even now his every gesture), and
not willing to show after all how totally collapsed and despondent
he really was, he sat down and taking up a magazine pretended to
read, the while he looked far, far beyond it to other
scenes&mdash;his mother&mdash;his brother and sisters&mdash; the
Griffiths&mdash;all he had known. But finding these unsubstantiated
mind visions a little too much, he finally got up and throwing off
his clothes climbed into his iron cot.</p>

<p>"Convicted! Convicted!" And that meant that he must die! God!
But how blessed to be able to conceal his face upon a pillow and
not let any one see&mdash;however accurately they might guess!</p>

<h3>Chapter 27</h3>

<p>The dreary aftermath of a great contest and a great failure,
with the general public from coast to coast&mdash;in view of this
stern local interpretation of the tragedy&mdash;firmly convinced
that Clyde was guilty and, as heralded by the newspapers
everywhere, that he had been properly convicted. The pathos of that
poor little murdered country girl! Her sad letters! How she must
have suffered! That weak defense! Even the Griffiths of Denver were
so shaken by the evidence as the trial had progressed that they
scarcely dared read the papers openly&mdash;one to the
other&mdash;but, for the most part, read of it separately and
alone, whispering together afterwards of the damning, awful deluge
of circumstantial evidence. Yet, after reading Belknap's speech and
Clyde's own testimony, this little family group that had struggled
along together for so long coming to believe in their own son and
brother in spite of all they had previously read against him. And
because of this&mdash;during the trial as well as
afterwards&mdash;writing him cheerful and hopeful letters, based
frequently on letters from him in which he insisted over and over
again that he was not guilty. Yet once convicted, and out of the
depths of his despair wiring his mother as he did&mdash;and the
papers confirming it&mdash;absolute consternation in the Griffiths
family. For was not this proof? Or, was it? All the papers seemed
to think so. And they rushed reporters to Mrs. Griffiths, who,
together with her little brood, had sought refuge from the
unbearable publicity in a remote part of Denver entirely removed
from the mission world. A venal moving-van company had revealed her
address.</p>

<p>And now this American witness to the rule of God upon earth,
sitting in a chair in her shabby, nondescript apartment,
hard-pressed for the very means to sustain herself&mdash;degraded
by the milling forces of life and the fell and brutal blows of
chance&mdash;yet serene in her trust&mdash;and declaring: "I cannot
think this morning. I seem numb and things look strange to me. My
boy found guilty of murder! But I am his mother and I am not
convinced of his guilt by any means! He has written me that he is
not guilty and I believe him. And to whom should he turn with the
truth and for trust if not to me? But there is He who sees all
things and who knows."</p>

<p>At the same time there was so much in the long stream of
evidence, as well as Clyde's first folly in Kansas City, that had
caused her to wonder&mdash;and fear. Why was he unable to explain
that folder? Why couldn't he have gone to the girl's aid when he
could swim so well? And why did he proceed so swiftly to the
mysterious Miss X&mdash; whoever she was? Oh, surely, surely,
surely, she was not going to be compelled, in spite of all her
faith, to believe that her eldest&mdash;the most ambitious and
hopeful, if restless, of all of her children, was guilty of such a
crime! No! She could not doubt him&mdash;even now. Under the
merciful direction of a living God, was it not evil in a mother to
believe evil of a child, however dread his erring ways might seem?
In the silence of the different rooms of the mission, before she
had been compelled to remove from there because of curious and
troublesome visitors, had she not stood many times in the center of
one of those miserable rooms while sweeping and dusting, free from
the eye of any observer&mdash;her head thrown back, her eyes
closed, her strong, brown face molded in homely and yet convinced
and earnest lines&mdash;a figure out of the early Biblical days of
her six-thousand-year-old world&mdash;and earnestly directing her
thoughts to that imaginary throne which she saw as occupied by the
living, giant mind and body of the living God&mdash;her Creator.
And praying by the quarter and the half hour that she be given
strength and understanding and guidance to know of her son's
innocence or guilt&mdash;and if innocent that this searing burden
of suffering be lifted from him and her and all those dear to him
and her&mdash;or if guilty, she be shown how to do&mdash;how to
endure the while he be shown how to wash from his immortal soul
forever the horror of the thing he had done&mdash;make himself once
more, if possible, white before the Lord.</p>

<p>"Thou art mighty, O God, and there is none beside Thee. Behold,
to Thee all things are possible. In Thy favor is Life. Have mercy,
O God. Though his sins be as scarlet, make him white as snow.
Though they be red like crimson, make them as wool."</p>

<p>Yet in her then&mdash;and as she prayed&mdash;was the wisdom of
Eve in regard to the daughters of Eve. That girl whom Clyde was
alleged to have slain&mdash;what about her? Had she not sinned too?
And was she not older than Clyde? The papers said so. Examining the
letters, line by line, she was moved by their pathos and was
intensely and pathetically grieved for the misery that had befallen
the Aldens. Nevertheless, as a mother and woman full of the wisdom
of ancient Eve, she saw how Roberta herself must have
consented&mdash;how the lure of her must have aided in the
weakening and the betrayal of her son. A strong, good girl would
not have consented&mdash;could not have. How many confessions about
this same thing had she not heard in the mission and at street
meetings? And might it not be said in Clyde's favor&mdash;as in the
very beginning of life in the Garden of Eden&mdash;"the woman
tempted me"?</p>

<p>Truly&mdash;and because of that&mdash;</p>

<p>"His mercy endureth forever," she quoted. And if His mercy
endureth&mdash;must that of Clyde's mother be less?</p>

<p>"If ye have faith, so much as the grain of a mustard seed," she
quoted to herself&mdash;and now, in the face of these importuning
reporters added: "Did my son kill her? That is the question.
Nothing else matters in the eyes of our Maker," and she looked at
the sophisticated, callous youths with the look of one who was sure
that her God would make them understand. And even so they were
impressed by her profound sincerity and faith. "Whether or not the
jury has found him guilty or innocent is neither here nor there in
the eyes of Him who holds the stars in the hollow of His hand. The
jury's finding is of men. It is of the earth's earthy. I have read
his lawyer's plea. My son himself has told me in his letters that
he is not guilty. I believe my son. I am convinced that he is
innocent."</p>

<p>And Asa in another corner of the room, saying little. Because of
his lack of comprehension of the actualities as well as his lack of
experience of the stern and motivating forces of passion, he was
unable to grasp even a tithe of the meaning of this. He had never
understood Clyde or his lacks or his feverish imaginings, so he
said, and preferred not to discuss him.</p>

<p>"But," continued Mrs. Griffiths, "at no time have I shielded
Clyde in his sin against Roberta Alden. He did wrong, but she did
wrong too in not resisting him. There can be no compromising with
sin in any one. And though my heart goes out in sympathy and love
to the bleeding heart of her dear mother and father who have
suffered so, still we must not fail to see that this sin was mutual
and that the world should know and judge accordingly. Not that I
want to shield him," she repeated. "He should have remembered the
teachings of his youth." And here her lips compressed in a sad and
somewhat critical misery. "But I have read her letters too. And I
feel that but for them, the prosecuting attorney would have no real
case against my son. He used them to work on the emotions of the
jury." She got up, tried as by fire, and exclaimed, tensely and
beautifully: "But he is my son! He has just been convicted. I must
think as a mother how to help him, however I feel as to his sin."
She gripped her hands together, and even the reporters were touched
by her misery. "I must go to him! I should have gone before. I see
it now." She paused, discovering herself to be addressing her
inmost agony, need, fear, to these public ears and voices, which
might in no wise understand or care.</p>

<p>"Some people wonder," now interrupted one of these same&mdash;a
most practical and emotionally calloused youth of Clyde's own
age&mdash;"why you weren't there during the trial. Didn't you have
the money to go?"</p>

<p>"I had no money," she replied simply. "Not enough, anyhow. And
besides, they advised me not to come&mdash;that they did not need
me. But now&mdash;now I must go&mdash;in some way&mdash;I must find
out how." She went to a small shabby desk, which was a part of the
sparse and colorless equipment of the room. "You boys are going
downtown," she said. "Would one of you send a telegram for me if I
give you the money?"</p>

<p>"Sure!" exclaimed the one who had asked her the rudest question.
"Give it to me. You don't need any money. I'll have the paper send
it." Also, as he thought, he would write it up, or in, as part of
his story.</p>

<p>She seated herself at the yellow and scratched desk and after
finding a small pad and pen, she wrote: "Clyde&mdash;Trust in God.
All things are possible to Him. Appeal at once. Read Psalm 51.
Another trial will prove your innocence. We will come to you soon.
Father and Mother."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I had just better give you the money," she added,
nervously, wondering whether it would be well to permit a newspaper
to pay for this and wondering at the same time if Clyde's uncle
would be willing to pay for an appeal. It might cost a great deal.
Then she added: "It's rather long."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't bother about that!" exclaimed another of the trio,
who was anxious to read the telegram. "Write all you want. We'll
see that it goes."</p>

<p>"I want a copy of that," added the third, in a sharp and
uncompromising tone, seeing that the first reporter was proceeding
to take and pocket the message. "This isn't private. I get it from
you or her&mdash;now!"</p>

<p>And at this, number one, in order to avoid a scene, which Mrs.
Griffiths, in her slow way, was beginning to sense, extracted the
slip from his pocket and turned it over to the others, who there
and then proceeded to copy it.</p>

<p>At the same time that this was going on, the Griffiths of
Lycurgus, having been consulted as to the wisdom and cost of a new
trial, disclosed themselves as by no means interested, let alone
convinced, that an appeal&mdash;at least at their expense&mdash;was
justified. The torture and socially&mdash;if not
commercially&mdash; destroying force of all this&mdash;every hour
of it a Golgotha! Bella and her social future, to say nothing of
Gilbert and his&mdash; completely overcast and charred by this
awful public picture of the plot and crime that one of their
immediate blood had conceived and executed! Samuel Griffiths
himself, as well as his wife, fairly macerated by this blasting
flash from his well-intentioned, though seemingly impractical and
nonsensical good deed. Had not a long, practical struggle with life
taught him that sentiment in business was folly? Up to the hour he
had met Clyde he had never allowed it to influence him in any way.
But his mistaken notion that his youngest brother had been unfairly
dealt with by their father! And now this! This! His wife and
daughter compelled to remove from the scene of their happiest years
and comforts and live as exiles&mdash; perhaps forever&mdash;in one
of the suburbs of Boston, or elsewhere&mdash;or forever endure the
eyes and sympathy of their friends! And himself and Gilbert almost
steadily conferring ever since as to the wisdom of uniting the
business in stock form with some of the others of Lycurgus or
elsewhere&mdash;or, if not that, of transferring, not by degrees
but speedily, to either Rochester or Buffalo or Boston or Brooklyn,
where a main plant might be erected. The disgrace of this could
only be overcome by absenting themselves from Lycurgus and all that
it represented to them. They must begin life all over
again&mdash;socially at least. That did not mean so much to himself
or his wife&mdash;their day was about over anyhow. But Bella and
Gilbert and Myra&mdash;how to rehabilitate them in some way,
somewhere?</p>

<p>And so, even before the trial was finished, a decision on the
part of Samuel and Gilbert Griffiths to remove the business to
South Boston, where they might decently submerge themselves until
the misery and shame of this had in part at least been
forgotten.</p>

<p>And because of this further aid to Clyde absolutely refused. And
Belknap and Jephson then sitting down together to consider. For
obviously, their time being as valuable as it was&mdash;devoted
hitherto to the most successful practice in Bridgeburg&mdash;and
with many matters waiting on account of the pressure of this
particular case&mdash; they were by no means persuaded that either
their practical self-interest or their charity permitted or
demanded their assisting Clyde without further recompense. In fact,
the expense of appealing this case was going to be considerable as
they saw it. The record was enormous. The briefs would be large and
expensive, and the State's allowance for them was pitifully small.
At the same time, as Jephson pointed out, it was folly to assume
that the western Griffiths might not be able to do anything at all.
Had they not been identified with religious and charitable work
this long while? And was it not possible, the tragedy of Clyde's
present predicament pointed out to them, that they might through
appeals of various kinds raise at least sufficient money to defray
the actual costs of such an appeal? Of course, they had not aided
Clyde up to the present time but that was because his mother had
been notified that she was not needed. It was different now.</p>

<p>"Better wire her to come on," suggested Jephson, practically.
"We can get Oberwaltzer to set the sentence over until the tenth if
we say that she is trying to come on here. Besides, just tell her
to do it and if she says she can't we'll see about the money then.
But she'll be likely to get it and maybe some towards the appeal
too."</p>

<p>And forthwith a telegram and a letter to Mrs. Griffiths, saying
that as yet no word had been said to Clyde but none-the-less his
Lycurgus relatives had declined to assist him further in any way.
Besides, he was to be sentenced not later than the tenth, and for
his own future welfare it was necessary that some
one&mdash;preferably herself&mdash;appear. Also that funds to cover
the cost of an appeal be raised, or at least the same
guaranteed.</p>

<p>And then Mrs. Griffiths, on her knees praying to her God to help
her. Here, <i>now</i>, he must show his Almighty hand&mdash;his
never-failing mercy. Enlightenment and help must come from
somewhere&mdash;otherwise how was she to get the fare, let alone
raise money for Clyde's appeal?</p>

<p>Yet as she prayed&mdash;on her knees&mdash;a thought. The
newspapers had been hounding her for interviews. They had followed
her here and there. Why had she not gone to her son's aid? What did
she think of this? What of that? And now she said to herself, why
should she not go to the editor of one of the great papers so
anxious to question her always and tell him how great was her need?
Also, that if he would help her to reach her son in time to be with
him on his day of sentence that she, his mother, would report the
same for him. These papers were sending their reporters here,
there&mdash; even to the trial, as she had read. Why not
her&mdash;his mother? Could she not speak and write too? How many,
many tracts had she not composed?</p>

<p>And so now to her feet&mdash;only to sink once more on her
knees: "Thou hast answered me, oh, my God!" she exclaimed. Then
rising, she got out her ancient brown coat, the commonplace brown
bonnet with strings&mdash;based on some mood in regard to religious
livery&mdash;and at once proceeded to the largest and most
important newspaper. And because of the notoriety of her son's
trial she was shown directly to the managing editor, who was as
much interested as he was impressed and who listened to her with
respect and sympathy. He understood her situation and was under the
impression that the paper would be interested in this. He
disappeared for a few moments&mdash;then returned. She would be
employed as a correspondent for a period of three weeks, and after
that until further notice. Her expenses to and fro would be
covered. An assistant, into whose hands he would now deliver her
would instruct her as to the method of preparing and filing her
communications. He would also provide her with some ready cash. She
might even leave tonight if she chose&mdash;the sooner, the better.
The paper would like a photograph or two before she left. But as he
talked, and as he noticed, her eyes were closed&mdash;her head
back. She was offering thanks to the God who had thus directly
answered her plea.</p>

<h3>Chapter 28</h3>

<p>Bridgeburg and a slow train that set down a tired, distrait
woman at its depot after midnight on the eighth of December. Bitter
cold and bright stars. A lone depot assistant who on inquiry
directed her to the Bridgeburg Central House&mdash;straight up the
street which now faced her, then two blocks to her left after she
reached the second street. The sleepy night clerk of the Central
House providing her instantly with a room and, once he knew who she
was, directing her to the county jail. But she deciding after due
rumination that now was not the hour. He might be sleeping. She
would go to bed and rise early in the morning. She had sent him
various telegrams. He knew that she was coming.</p>

<p>But as early as seven in the morning, rising, and by eight
appearing at the jail, letters, telegrams and credentials in hand.
And the jail officials, after examining the letters she carried and
being convinced of her identity, notifying Clyde of her presence.
And he, depressed and forlorn, on hearing this news, welcoming the
thought of her as much as at first he had dreaded her coming. For
now things were different. All the long grim story had been told.
And because of the plausible explanation which Jephson had provided
him, he could face her perhaps and say without a quaver that it was
true&mdash;that he had not plotted to kill Roberta&mdash;that he
had not willingly left her to die in the water. And then hurrying
down to the visitor's room, where, by the courtesy of Slack, he was
permitted to talk with his mother alone.</p>

<p>On seeing her rise at his entrance, and hurrying to her, his
troubled intricate soul not a little dubious, yet confident also
that it was to find sanctuary, sympathy, help, perhaps&mdash;and
that without criticism&mdash;in her heart. And exclaiming with
difficulty, as a lump thickened in his throat: "Gee, Ma! I'm glad
you've come." But she too moved for words&mdash;her condemned boy
in her arms&mdash; merely drawing his head to her shoulder and then
looking up. The Lord God had vouchsafed her this much. Why not
more? The ultimate freedom of her son&mdash;or if not that, at
least a new trial&mdash;a fair consideration of the evidence in his
favor which had not been had yet, of course. And so they stood for
several moments.</p>

<p>Then news of home, the reason for her presence, her duty as a
correspondent to interview him&mdash;later to appear with him in
court at the hour of his sentence&mdash;a situation over which
Clyde winced. Yet now, as he heard from her, his future was likely
to depend on her efforts alone. The Lycurgus Griffiths, for reasons
of their own, had decided not to aid him further. But she&mdash;if
she were but able to face the world with a sound claim&mdash;might
still aid him. Had not the Lord aided her thus far? Yet to face the
world and the Lord with her just one plea she must know from
him&mdash;now&mdash;the truth as to whether he had intentionally or
unintentionally struck Roberta&mdash;whether intentionally or
unintentionally he had left her to die. She had read the evidence
and his letters and had noted all the defects in his testimony. But
were those things as contended by Mason true or false?</p>

<p>Clyde, now as always overawed and thrown back on himself by that
uncompromising and shameless honesty which he had never been able
quite to comprehend in her, announced, with all the firmness that
he could muster&mdash;yet with a secret quavering chill in his
heart&mdash; that he had sworn to the truth. He had not done those
things with which he had been charged. He had not. But, alas, as
she now said to herself, on observing him, what was that about his
eyes&mdash;a faint flicker perhaps. He was not so sure&mdash;as
self-convinced and definite as she had hoped&mdash;as she had
prayed he would be. No, no, there was something in his manner, his
words, as he spoke&mdash;a faint recessive intonation, a sense of
something troubled, dubious, perhaps, which quite froze her
now.</p>

<p>He was not positive enough. And so he might have plotted, in
part at least, as she had feared at first, when she had first heard
of this&mdash;might have even struck her on that lone, secret
lake!&mdash;who could tell? (the searing, destroying power of such
a thought as that). And that in the face of all his testimony to
the contrary.</p>

<p>But "Jehovah, jirah, Thou wilt not require of a mother, in her
own and her son's darkest hour, that she doubt him,&mdash;make sure
his death through her own lack of faith? Oh, no&mdash;Thou wilt
not. O Lamb of God, Thou wilt not!" She turned; she bruised under
her heel the scaly head of this dark suspicion&mdash;as terrifying
to her as his guilt was to him. "O Absalom, my Absalom!" Come,
come, we will not entertain such a thought. God himself would not
urge it upon a mother. Was he not here&mdash;her son&mdash;before
her, declaring firmly that he had not done this thing. She must
believe&mdash;she would believe him utterly. She would&mdash;and
did&mdash;whatever fiend of doubt might still remain locked in the
lowest dungeon of her miserable heart. Come, come, the public
should know how she felt. She and her son would find a way. He must
believe and pray. Did he have a Bible? Did he read it? And Clyde
having been long since provided with a Bible by a prison worker,
assured her that he had and did read it.</p>

<p>But now she must go first to see his lawyers, next to file her
dispatch, after which she would return. But once out on the street
being immediately set upon by several reporters and eagerly
questioned as to the meaning of her presence here. Did she believe
in her son's innocence? Did she or did she not think that he had
had a fair trial? Why had she not come on before? And Mrs.
Griffiths, in her direct and earnest and motherly way, taking them
into her confidence and telling how as well as why she came to be
here, also why she had not come before.</p>

<p>But now that she was here she hoped to stay. The Lord would
provide the means for the salvation of her son, of whose innocence
she was convinced. Would they not ask God to help her? Would they
not pray for her success? And with the several reporters not a
little moved and impressed, assuring her that they would, of
course, and thereafter describing her to the world at large as she
was&mdash;middle-aged, homely, religious, determined, sincere and
earnest and with a moving faith in the innocence of her boy.</p>

<p>But the Griffiths of Lycurgus, on hearing this, resenting her
coming as one more blow. And Clyde, in his cell, on reading of it
later, somewhat shocked by the gross publicity now attending
everything in connection with him, yet, because of his mother's
presence, resigned and after a time almost happy. Whatever her
faults or defects, after all she was his mother, wasn't she? And
she had come to his aid. Let the public think what it would. Was he
not in the shadow of death and she at least had not deserted him.
And with this, her suddenly manifested skill in connecting herself
in this way with a Denver paper, to praise her for.</p>

<p>She had never done anything like this before. And who knew but
that possibly, and even in the face of her dire poverty now, she
might still be able to solve this matter of a new trial for him and
to save his life? Who knew? And yet how much and how indifferently
he had sinned against her! Oh, how much. And still here she
was&mdash; his mother still anxious and tortured and yet loving and
seeking to save his life by writing up his own conviction for a
western paper. No longer did the shabby coat and the outlandish hat
and the broad, immobile face and somewhat stolid and crude gestures
seem the racking and disturbing things they had so little time
since. She was his mother and she loved him, and believed in him
and was struggling to save him.</p>

<p>On the other hand Belknap and Jephson on first encountering her
were by no means so much impressed. For some reason they had not
anticipated so crude and unlettered and yet convinced a figure. The
wide, flat shoes. The queer hat. The old brown coat. Yet somehow,
after a few moments, arrested by her earnestness and faith and love
for her son and her fixed, inquiring, and humanly clean and pure
blue eyes in which dwelt immaterial conviction and sacrifice with
no shadow of turning.</p>

<p>Did they personally think her son innocent? She must know that
first. Or did they secretly believe that he was guilty? She had
been so tortured by all the contradictory evidence. God had laid a
heavy cross upon her and hers. Nevertheless, Blessed be His name!
And both, seeing and feeling her great concern, were quick to
assure her that they were convinced of Clyde's innocence. If he
were executed for this alleged crime it would be a travesty on
justice.</p>

<p>Yet both, now that they saw her, troubled as to the source of
any further funds, her method of getting here, which she now
explained, indicating that she had nothing. And an appeal sure to
cost not less than two thousand. And Mrs. Griffiths, after an hour
in their presence, in which they made clear to her the basic cost
of an appeal&mdash;covering briefs to be prepared, arguments, trips
to be made&mdash;asserting repeatedly that she did not quite see
how she was to do. Then suddenly, and to them somewhat
inconsequentially, yet movingly and dramatically, exclaiming: "The
Lord will not desert me. I know it. He has declared himself unto
me. It was His voice there in Denver that directed me to that
paper. And now that I am here, I will trust Him and He will guide
me."</p>

<p>But Belknap and Jephson merely looking at one another in
unconvinced and pagan astonishment. Such faith! An exhorter! An
Evangelist, no less! Yet to Jephson, here was an idea! There was
the religious element to be reckoned with everywhere&mdash;strong
in its agreement with just such faith. Assuming the Griffiths of
Lycurgus to remain obdurate and unmoved&mdash;why then&mdash;why
then&mdash;and now that she was here&mdash;there were the churches
and the religious people generally. Might it not be possible, with
such a temperament and such faith as this, to appeal to the very
element that had hitherto most condemned Clyde and made his
conviction a certainty, for funds wherewith to carry this case to
the court of appeals? This lorn mother. Her faith in her boy.</p>

<p>Presto!</p>

<p>A lecture, at so much for admission, and in which, hard-pressed
as she was and could show, she would set forth the righteousness of
her boy's claim&mdash;seek to obtain the sympathy of the prejudiced
public and incidentally two thousand dollars or more with which
this appeal could be conducted.</p>

<p>And now Jephson, turning to her and laying the matter before her
and offering to prepare a lecture or notes&mdash;a condensation of
his various arguments&mdash;in fact, an entire lecture which she
could re-arrange and present as she chose&mdash;all the data which
was the ultimate, basic truth in regard to her son. And she, her
brown cheeks flushing and her eyes brightening, agreeing she would
do it. She would try. She could do no less than try. Verily,
verily, was not this the Voice and Hand of God in the darkest hour
of her tribulation?</p>

<p>On the following morning Clyde was arraigned for sentence, with
Mrs. Griffiths given a seat near him and seeking, paper and pencil
in hand, to make notes of, for her, an unutterable scene, while a
large crowd surveyed her. His own mother! And acting as a reporter!
Something absurd, grotesque, insensitive, even ludicrous, about
such a family and such a scene. And to think the Griffiths of
Lycurgus should be so immediately related to them.</p>

<p>Yet Clyde sustained and heartened by her presence. For had she
not returned to the jail the previous afternoon with her plan? And
as soon as this was over&mdash;whatever the sentence might
be&mdash;she would begin with her work.</p>

<p>And so, and that almost in spite of himself, in his darkest
hour, standing up before Justice Oberwaltzer and listening first to
a brief recital of his charge and trial (which was pronounced by
Oberwaltzer to have been fair and impartial), then to the
customary: "Have you any cause which shows why the judgment of
death should not now be pronounced against you according to
law?"&mdash; to which and to the astonishment of his mother and the
auditors (if not Jephson, who had advised and urged him so to do),
Clyde now in a clear and firm voice replied:</p>

<p>"I am innocent of the crime as charged in the indictment. I
never killed Roberta Alden and therefore I think this sentence
should not be passed."</p>

<p>And then staring straight before him conscious only of the look
of admiration and love turned on him by his mother. For had not her
son now declared himself, here at this fatal moment, before all
these people? And his word here, if not in that jail, would be
true, would it not? Then her son was not guilty. He was not. He was
not. Praised be the name of the Lord in the highest. And deciding
to make a great point of this in her dispatch&mdash;so as to get it
in all the papers, and in her lecture afterwards.</p>

<p>However, Oberwaltzer, without the faintest sign of surprise or
perturbation, now continued: "Is there anything else you care to
say?"</p>

<p>"No," replied Clyde, after a moment's hesitation.</p>

<p>"Clyde Griffiths," then concluded Oberwaltzer, "the judgment of
the Court is that you, Clyde Griffiths, for the murder in the first
degree of one, Roberta Alden, whereof you are convicted, be, and
you are hereby sentenced to the punishment of death; and it is
ordered that, within ten days after this day's session of Court,
the Sheriff of this county of Cataraqui deliver you, together with
the warrant of this Court, to the Agent and Warden of the State
Prison of the State of New York at Auburn, where you shall be kept
in solitary confinement until the week beginning Monday the 28th
day of January, 19&mdash;, and, upon some day within the week so
appointed, the said Agent and Warden of the State Prison of the
State of New York at Auburn is commended to do execution upon you,
Clyde Griffiths, in the mode and manner prescribed by the laws of
the State of New York."<br>
<br></p>

<p>And that done, a smile from Mrs. Griffiths to her boy and an
answering smile from Clyde to her. For since he had announced that
he was not guilty&mdash;<i>here</i>&mdash;her spirit had risen in
the face of this sentence. He was really innocent,&mdash;he must
be, since he had declared it here. And Clyde because of her smile
saying to himself, his mother believed in him now. She had not been
swayed by all the evidence against him. And this faith, mistaken or
not, was now so sustaining&mdash;so needed. What he had just said
was true as he now saw it. He had not struck Roberta. That
<i>was</i> true. And therefore he was not guilty. Yet Kraut and
Slack were once more seizing him and escorting him to the cell.</p>

<p>Immediately thereafter his mother seating herself at a press
table proceeded to explain to contiguous press representatives now
curiously gathering about her: "You mustn't think too badly of me,
you gentlemen of the papers. I don't know much about this but it is
the only way I could think of to be with my boy. I couldn't have
come otherwise." And then one lanky correspondent stepping up to
say: "Don't worry, mother. Is there any way I can help you? Want me
to straighten out what you want to say? I'll be glad to." And then
sitting down beside her and proceeding to help her arrange her
impressions in the form in which he assumed her Denver paper might
like them. And others as well offering to do anything they
could&mdash;and all greatly moved.</p>

<p>Two days later, the proper commitment papers having been
prepared and his mother notified of the change but not permitted to
accompany him, Clyde was removed to Auburn, the Western
penitentiary of the State of New York, where in the "death house"
or "Murderers' Row," as it was called&mdash;as gloomy and
torturesome an inferno as one could imagine any human compelled to
endure&mdash;a combination of some twenty-two cells on two separate
levels&mdash;he was to be restrained until ordered retried or
executed.</p>

<p>Yet as he traveled from Bridgeburg to this place, impressive
crowds at every station&mdash;young and old&mdash;men, women and
children&mdash;all seeking a glimpse of the astonishingly youthly
slayer. And girls and women, under the guise of kindly interest,
but which, at best, spelled little more than a desire to achieve a
facile intimacy with this daring and romantic, if unfortunate
figure, throwing him a flower here and there and calling to him
gayly and loudly as the train moved out from one station or
another:</p>

<p>"Hello, Clyde! Hope to see you soon again. Don't stay too long
down there."</p>

<p>"If you take an appeal, you're sure to be acquitted. We hope so,
anyhow."</p>

<p>And with Clyde not a little astonished and later even heartened
by this seemingly favorable discrepancy between the attitude of the
crowds in Bridgeburg and this sudden, morbid, feverish and even
hectic curiosity here, bowing and smiling and even waving with his
hand. Yet thinking, none the less, "I am on the way to the death
house and they can be so friendly. It is a wonder they dare." And
with Kraut and Sissel, his guards, because of the distinction and
notoriety of being both his captors and jailors, as well also
because of these unusual attentions from passengers on the train
and individuals in these throngs without being themselves flattered
and ennobled.</p>

<p>But after this one brief colorful flight in the open since his
arrest, past these waiting throngs and over winter sunlit fields
and hills of snow that reminded him of Lycurgus, Sondra, Roberta,
and all that he had so kaleidoscopically and fatally known in the
twenty months just past, the gray and restraining walls of Auburn
itself&mdash;with, once he was presented to a clerk in the warden's
office and his name and crime entered in the books&mdash;himself
assigned to two assistants, who saw to it that he was given a
prison bath and hair cut&mdash;all the wavy, black hair he so much
admired cut away&mdash;a prison-striped uniform and hideous cap of
the same material, prison underwear and heavy gray felt shoes to
quiet the restless prison tread in which in time he might indulge,
together with the number, 77221.</p>

<p>And so accoutered, immediately transferred to the death house
proper, where in a cell on the ground floor he was now
locked&mdash;a squarish light clean space, eight by ten feet in
size and fitted with sanitary plumbing as well as a cot bed, a
table, a chair and a small rack for books. And here then, while he
barely sensed that there were other cells about him&mdash;ranging
up and down a wide hall&mdash; he first stood&mdash;and then seated
himself&mdash;now no longer buoyed by the more intimate and
sociable life of the jail at Bridgeburg&mdash;or those strange
throngs and scenes that had punctuated his trip here.</p>

<p>The hectic tensity and misery of these hours! That sentence to
die; that trip with all those people calling to him; that cutting
of his hair downstairs in that prison barber shop&mdash;and by a
convict; the suit and underwear that was now his and that he now
had on. There was no mirror here&mdash;or anywhere,&mdash;but no
matter&mdash;he could feel how he looked. This baggy coat and
trousers and this striped cap. He threw it hopelessly to the floor.
For but an hour before he had been clothed in a decent suit and
shirt and tie and shoes, and his appearance had been neat and
pleasing as he himself had thought as he left Bridgeburg. But
now&mdash;how must he look? And to-morrow his mother would be
coming&mdash;and later Jephson or Belknap, maybe. God!</p>

<p>But worse&mdash;there, in that cell directly opposite him, a
sallow and emaciated and sinister-looking Chinaman in a suit
exactly like his own, who had come to the bars of his door and was
looking at him out of inscrutable slant eyes, but as immediately
turning and scratching himself&mdash;vermin, maybe, as Clyde
immediately feared. There had been bedbugs at Bridgeburg.</p>

<p>A Chinese murderer. For was not this the death house? But as
good as himself here. And with a garb like his own. Thank God
visitors were probably not many. He had heard from his mother that
scarcely any were allowed&mdash;that only she and Belknap and
Jephson and any minister he chose might come once a week. But now
these hard, white-painted walls brightly lighted by wide
unobstructed skylights by day and as he could see&mdash;by
incandescent lamps in the hall without at night&mdash;yet all so
different from Bridgeburg,&mdash;so much more bright or harsh
illuminatively. For there, the jail being old, the walls were a
gray-brown, and not very clean&mdash;the cells larger, the
furnishings more numerous&mdash;a table with a cloth on it at
times, books, papers, a chess- and checker-board&mdash;whereas
here&mdash; here was nothing, these hard narrow walls&mdash;the
iron bars rising to a heavy solid ceiling above&mdash;and that
very, very heavy iron door which yet&mdash;like the one at
Bridgeburg, had a small hole through which food would be passed, of
course.</p>

<p>But just then a voice from somewhere:</p>

<p>"Hey! we got a new one wid us, fellers! Ground tier, second
cell, east." And then a second voice: "You don't say. Wot's he
like?" And a third: "Wot's yer name, new man? Don't be scared. You
ain't no worse off than the rest of us." And then the first voice,
answering number two: "Kinda tall and skinny. A kid. Looks a little
like mamma's boy, but not bad at dat. Hey, you! Tell us your
name!"</p>

<p>And Clyde, amazed and dumb and pondering. For how was one to
take such an introduction as this? What to say&mdash;what to do?
Should he be friendly with these men? Yet, his instinct for tact
prompting him even here to reply, most courteously and promptly:
"Clyde Griffiths." And one of the first voices continuing: "Oh,
sure! We know who you are. Welcome, Griffiths. We ain't as bad as
we sound. We been readin' a lot about you, up dere in Bridgeburg.
We thought you'd be along pretty soon now." And another voice: "You
don't want to be too down. It ain't so worse here. At least de
place is all right&mdash;a roof over your head, as dey say." And
then a laugh from somewhere.</p>

<p>But Clyde, too horrified and sickened for words, was sadly
gazing at the walls and door, then over at the Chinaman, who,
silent at his door, was once more gazing at him. Horrible!
Horrible! And they talked to each other like that, and to a
stranger among them so familiarly. No thought for his wretchedness,
his strangeness, his timidity&mdash;the horror he must be
suffering. But why should a murderer seem timid to any one,
perhaps, or miserable? Worst of all they had been speculating
<i>here</i> as to how long it would be before he would be along
which meant that everything concerning him was known here. Would
they nag&mdash;or bully&mdash;or make trouble for one unless one
did just as they wished? If Sondra, or any one of all the people he
had known, should see or even dream of him as he was here
now...God!&mdash;And his own mother was coming to-morrow.</p>

<p>And then an hour later, now evening, a tall, cadaverous guard in
a more pleasing uniform, putting an iron tray with food on it
through that hole in the door. Food! And for him here. And that
sallow, rickety Chinaman over the way taking his. Whom had he
murdered? How? And then the savage scraping of iron trays in the
various cells! Sounds that reminded him more of hungry animals
being fed than men. And some of these men were actually talking as
they ate and scraped. It sickened him.</p>

<p>"Gee! It's a wonder them guys in the mush gallery couldn't think
of somepin else besides cold beans and fried potatoes and
coffee."</p>

<p>"The coffee tonight...oh, boy!...Now in the jail at
Buffalo&mdash;though..."</p>

<p>"Oh, cut it out," came from another corner. "We've heard enough
about the jail at Buffalo and your swell chow. You don't show any
afternoon tea appetite around here, I notice."</p>

<p>"Just the same," continued the first voice, "as I look back on't
now, it musta been pretty good. Dat's a way it seems, anyhow,
now."</p>

<p>"Oh, Rafferty, do let up," called still another.</p>

<p>And then, presumably "Rafferty" once more, who said: "Now, I'll
just take a little siesta after dis&mdash;and den I'll call me
chauffeur and go for a little spin. De air to-night must be
fine."</p>

<p>Then from still another hoarse voice: "Oh, you with your sick
imagination. Say, I'd give me life for a smoker. And den a good
game of cards."</p>

<p>"Do they play cards here?" thought Clyde.</p>

<p>"I suppose since Rosenstein was defeated for mayor here he won't
play."</p>

<p>"Won't he, though?" This presumably from Rosenstein.</p>

<p>To Clyde's left, in the cell next to him, a voice, to a passing
guard, low and yet distinctly audible: "Psst! Any word from Albany
yet?"</p>

<p>"No word, Herman."</p>

<p>"And no letter, I suppose."</p>

<p>"No letter."</p>

<p>The voice was very strained, very tense, very miserable, and
after this, silence.</p>

<p>A moment later, from another cell farther off, a voice from the
lowest hell to which a soul can descend&mdash;complete and
unutterable despair&mdash;"Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!"</p>

<p>And then from the tier above another voice: "Oh, Jesus! Is that
farmer going to begin again? I can't stand it. Guard! Guard! Can't
you get some dope for that guy?"</p>

<p>Once more the voice from the lowest: "Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!"</p>

<p>Clyde was up, his fingers clinched. His nerves were as taut as
cords about to snap. A murderer! And about to die, perhaps. Or
grieving over some terrible thing like his own fate.
Moaning&mdash;as he in spirit at least had so often moaned there in
Bridgeburg. Crying like that! God! And there must be others!</p>

<p>And day after day and night after night more of this, no doubt,
until, maybe&mdash;who could tell&mdash;unless. But, oh, no! Oh,
no! Not himself&mdash;not that&mdash;not his day. Oh, no. A whole
year must elapse before that could possibly happen&mdash;or so
Jephson had said. Maybe two. But, at that&mdash;!...in two years!!!
He found himself stricken with an ague because of the thought that
even in so brief a time as two years...</p>

<p>That other room! It was in here somewhere too. This room was
connected with it. He knew that. There was a door. It led to that
chair. <i>That chair</i>.</p>

<p>And then the voice again, as before, "Oh, my God! Oh, my
God!"</p>

<p>He sank to his couch and covered his ears with his hands.</p>

<h3>Chapter 29</h3>

<p>The "death house" in this particular prison was one of those
crass erections and maintenances of human insensitiveness and
stupidity principally for which no one primarily was really
responsible. Indeed, its total plan and procedure were the results
of a series of primary legislative enactments, followed by
decisions and compulsions as devised by the temperaments and
seeming necessities of various wardens, until at last&mdash;by
degrees and without anything worthy of the name of thinking on any
one's part&mdash;there had been gathered and was now being enforced
all that could possibly be imagined in the way of unnecessary and
really unauthorized cruelty or stupid and destructive torture. And
to the end that a man, once condemned by a jury, would be compelled
to suffer not alone the death for which his sentence called, but a
thousand others before that. For the very room by its arrangement,
as well as the rules governing the lives and actions of the
inmates, was sufficient to bring about this torture,
willy-nilly.</p>

<p>It was a room thirty by fifty feet, of stone and concrete and
steel, and surmounted some thirty feet from the floor by a
skylight. Presumably an improvement over an older and worse death
house, with which it was still connected by a door, it was divided
lengthwise by a broad passage, along which, on the ground floor,
were twelve cells, six on a side and eight by ten each and facing
each other. And above again a second tier of what were known as
balcony cells&mdash;five on a side.</p>

<p>There was, however, at the center of this main passage&mdash;and
dividing these lower cells equally as to number&mdash;a second and
narrower passage, which at one end gave into what was now known as
the Old Death House (where at present only visitors to the inmates
of the new Death House were received), and at the other into the
execution room in which stood the electric chair. Two of the cells
on the lower passage&mdash;those at the junction of the narrower
passage&mdash;faced the execution-room door. The two opposite
these, on the corresponding corners, faced the passage that gave
into the Old Death House or what now by a large stretch of the
imagination, could be called the condemned men's reception room,
where twice weekly an immediate relative or a lawyer might be met.
But no others.</p>

<p>In the Old Death House (or present reception room), the cells
still there, and an integral part of this reception plan, were all
in a row and on one side only of a corridor, thus preventing prying
inspection by one inmate of another, and with a wire screen in
front as well as green shades which might be drawn in front of each
cell. For, in an older day, whenever a new convict arrived or
departed, or took his daily walk, or went for his bath, or was led
eventually through the little iron door to the west where formerly
was the execution chamber, these shades were drawn. He was not
supposed to be seen by his associates. Yet the old death house,
because of this very courtesy and privacy, although intense
solitude, was later deemed inhuman and hence this newer and better
death house, as the thoughtful and condescending authorities saw
it, was devised.</p>

<p>In this, to be sure, were no such small and gloomy cells as
those which characterized the old, for there the ceiling was low
and the sanitary arrangements wretched, whereas in the new one the
ceiling was high, the rooms and corridors brightly lighted and in
every instance no less than eight by ten feet in size. But by
contrast with the older room, they had the enormous disadvantage of
the unscreened if not uncurtained cell doors.</p>

<p>Besides, by housing all together in two such tiers as were here,
it placed upon each convict the compulsion of enduring all the
horrors of all the vicious, morbid or completely collapsed and
despairing temperaments about him. No true privacy of any kind. By
day&mdash;a blaze of light pouring through an over-arching skylight
high above the walls. By night&mdash;glistening incandescents of
large size and power which flooded each nook and cranny of the
various cells. No privacy, no games other than cards and
checkers&mdash;the only ones playable without releasing the
prisoners from their cells. Books, newspapers, to be sure, for all
who could read or enjoy them under the circumstances. And
visits&mdash;mornings and afternoons, as a rule, from a priest, and
less regularly from a rabbi and a Protestant minister, each
offering his sympathies or services to such as would accept
them.</p>

<p>But the curse of the place was not because of these advantages,
such as they were, but in spite of them&mdash;this unremitted
contact, as any one could see, with minds now terrorized and
discolored by the thought of an approaching death that was so near
for many that it was as an icy hand upon the brow or shoulder. And
none&mdash; whatever the bravado&mdash;capable of enduring it
without mental or physical deterioration in some form. The
glooms&mdash;the strains&mdash;the indefinable terrors and despairs
that blew like winds or breaths about this place and depressed or
terrorized all by turns! They were manifest at the most unexpected
moments, by curses, sighs, tears even, calls for a song&mdash;for
God's sake!&mdash;or the most unintended and unexpected yells or
groans. Worse yet, and productive of perhaps the most grinding and
destroying of all the miseries here&mdash;the transverse passage
leading between the old death house on the one hand and the
execution-chamber on the other. For this from time to
time&mdash;alas, how frequently&mdash;was the scene or stage for at
least a part of the tragedy that was here so regularly
enacted&mdash;the final business of execution.</p>

<p>For through this passage, on his last day, a man was transferred
from his <i>better</i> cell in the new building, where he might
have been incarcerated for so much as a year or two, to one of the
older ones in the old death house, in order that he might spend his
last hours in solitude, although compelled at the final moment,
none-the-less (the death march), to retrace his steps along this
narrower cross passage&mdash;and where all might see&mdash;into the
execution chamber at the other end of it.</p>

<p>Also at any time, in going to visit a lawyer or relative brought
into the old death house for this purpose, it was necessary to pass
along the middle passage to this smaller one and so into the old
death house, there to be housed in a cell, fronted by a wire screen
two feet distant, between which and the cell proper a guard must
sit while a prisoner and his guest (wife, son, mother, daughter,
brother, lawyer) should converse&mdash;the guard hearing all. No
hand-clasps, no kisses, no friendly touches of any kind&mdash;not
even an intimate word that a listening guard might not hear. And
when the fatal hour for any one had at last arrived, every
prisoner&mdash;if sinister or simple, sensitive or of rugged
texture&mdash;was actually if not intentionally compelled to hear
if not witness the final preparations&mdash;the removal of the
condemned man to one of the cells of the older death house, the
final and perhaps weeping visit of a mother, son, daughter,
father.</p>

<p>No thought in either the planning or the practice of all this of
the unnecessary and unfair torture for those who were brought here,
not to be promptly executed, by any means, but rather to be held
until the higher courts should have passed upon the merits of their
cases&mdash;an appeal.</p>

<p>At first, of course, Clyde sensed little if anything of all
this. In so far as his first day was concerned, he had but tasted
the veriest spoonful of it all. And to lighten or darken his burden
his mother came at noon the very next day. Not having been
permitted to accompany him, she had waited over for a final
conference with Belknap and Jephson, as well as to write in full
her personal impressions in connection with her son's
departure&mdash; (Those nervously searing impressions!) And
although anxious to find a room somewhere near the penitentiary,
she hurried first to the office of the penitentiary immediately
upon her arrival at Auburn and, after presenting an order from
Justice Oberwaltzer as well as a solicitous letter from Belknap and
Jephson urging the courtesy of a private interview with Clyde to
begin with at least, she was permitted to see her son in a room
entirely apart from the old death house. For already the warden
himself had been reading of her activities and sacrifices and was
interested in seeing not only her but Clyde also.</p>

<p>But so shaken was she by Clyde's so sudden and amazingly changed
appearance here that she could scarcely speak upon his entrance,
even in recognition of him, so blanched and gray were his cheeks
and so shadowy and strained his eyes. His head clipped that way!
This uniform! And in this dreadful place of iron gates and locks
and long passages with uniformed guards at every turn!</p>

<p>For a moment she winced and trembled, quite faint under the
strain, although previous to this she had entered many a jail and
larger prison&mdash;in Kansas City, Chicago, Denver&mdash;and
delivered tracts and exhortations and proffered her services in
connection with anything she might do. But this&mdash;this! Her own
son! Her broad, strong bosom began to heave. She looked, and then
turned her heavy, broad back to hide her face for the nonce. Her
lips and chin quivered. She began to fumble in the small bag she
carried for her handkerchief at the same time that she was
muttering to herself: "My God&mdash;why hast Thou forsaken me?" But
even as she did so there came the thought&mdash;no, no, he must not
see her so. What a way was this to do&mdash;and by her tears weaken
him. And yet despite her great strength she could not now cease at
once but cried on.</p>

<p>And Clyde seeing this, and despite his previous determination to
bear up and say some comforting and heartening word to his mother,
now began:</p>

<p>"But you mustn't, Ma. Gee, you mustn't cry. I know it's hard on
you. But I'll be all right. Sure I will. It isn't as bad as I
thought." Yet inwardly saying: "Oh, God how bad!"</p>

<p>And Mrs. Griffiths adding aloud: "My poor boy! My beloved son!
But we mustn't give way. No. No. 'Behold I will deliver thee out of
the snares of the wicked.' God has not deserted either of us. And
He will not&mdash;that I know. 'He leadeth me by the still waters.'
'He restoreth my soul.' We must put our trust in Him. Besides," she
added, briskly and practically, as much to strengthen herself as
Clyde, "haven't I already arranged for an appeal? It is to be made
yet this week. They're going to file a notice. And that means that
your case can't even be considered under a year. But it is just the
shock of seeing you so. You see, I wasn't quite prepared for it."
She straightened her shoulders and now looked up and achieved a
brave if strained smile. "The warden here seems very kind, but
still, somehow, when I saw you just now&mdash;"</p>

<p>She dabbed at her eyes which were damp from this sudden and
terrific storm, and to divert herself as well as him she talked of
the so very necessary work before her. Messrs. Belknap and Jephson
had been so encouraging to her just before she left. She had gone
to their office and they had urged her and him to be of good cheer.
And now she was going to lecture, and at once, and would soon have
means to do with that way. Oh, yes. And Mr. Jephson would be down
to see him one of these days soon. He was by no means to feel that
the legal end of all this had been reached. Far from it. The recent
verdict and sentence was sure to be reversed and a new trial
ordered. The recent one was a farce, as he knew.</p>

<p>And as for herself&mdash;as soon as she found a room near the
prison&mdash; she was going to the principal ministers of Auburn
and see if she could not secure a church, or two, or three, in
which to speak and plead his cause. Mr. Jephson was mailing her
some information she could use within a day or two. And after that,
other churches in Syracuse, Rochester, Albany, Schenectady&mdash;in
fact many cities in the east&mdash;until she had raised the
necessary sum. But she would not neglect him. She would see him at
least once a week and would write him a letter every other day, or
maybe even daily if she could. She would talk to the warden. So he
must not despair. She had much hard work ahead of her, of course,
but the Lord would guide her in all that she undertook. She knew
that. Had He not already shown his gracious and miraculous
mercy?</p>

<p>Clyde must pray for her and for himself. Read Isaiah. Read the
psalms&mdash;the 23rd and the 51st and 91st daily. Also Habbakuk.
"Are there walls against the Hand of the Lord?" And then after more
tears, an utterly moving and macerating scene, at last achieving
her departure while Clyde, shaken to his soul by so much misery,
returned to his cell. His mother. And at her age&mdash;and with so
little money&mdash;she was going out to try to raise the money
necessary to save him. And in the past he had treated her so
badly&mdash;as he now saw.</p>

<p>He sat down on the side of his cot and held his head in his
hands the while outside the prison&mdash;the iron door of the same
closed and only a lonely room and the ordeal of her proposed
lecture tour ahead of her&mdash;Mrs. Griffiths paused&mdash;by no
means so assured or convinced of all she had said to Clyde. To be
sure God would aid her. He must. Had He ever failed her
yet&mdash;completely? And now&mdash; herein her darkest hour, her
son's! Would He?</p>

<p>She paused for a moment a little later in a small parking-place,
beyond the prison, to stare at the tall, gray walls, the watch
towers with armed guards in uniform, the barred windows and doors.
A penitentiary. And her son was now within&mdash;worse yet, in that
confined and narrow death house. And doomed to die in an electric
chair. Unless&mdash;unless&mdash;But, no, no&mdash;that should not
be. It could not be. That appeal. The money for it. She must busy
herself as to that at once&mdash;not think or brood or despair. Oh,
no. "My shield and my buckler." "My Light and my Strength." "Oh,
Lord, Thou art my strength and my deliverance. In Thee will I
trust." And then dabbing at her eyes once more and adding: "Oh,
Lord, I believe. Help Thou mine unbelief."</p>

<p>So Mrs. Griffiths, alternately praying and crying as she
walked.</p>

<h3>Chapter 30</h3>

<p>But after this the long days in prison for Clyde. Except for a
weekly visit from his mother, who, once she was entered upon her
work, found it difficult to see him more often than
that&mdash;traveling as she did in the next two months between
Albany and Buffalo and even New York City&mdash;but without the
success she had at first hoped for. For in the matter of her appeal
to the churches and the public&mdash;as most wearily (and in secret
if not to Clyde)&mdash;and after three weeks of more or less
regional and purely sectarian trying, she was compelled to report
the Christians at least were very indifferent&mdash;not as
Christian as they should be. For as all, but more particularly the
ministers of the region, since they most guardedly and reservedly
represented their congregations in every instance, unanimously saw
it, here was a notorious and, of course, most unsavory trial which
had resulted in a conviction with which the more conservative
element of the country&mdash;if one could judge by the papers at
least, were in agreement.</p>

<p>Besides who was this woman&mdash;as well as her son? An
exhorter&mdash; a secret preacher&mdash;one, who in defiance of all
the tenets and processes of organized and historic, as well as
hieratic, religious powers and forms (theological seminaries,
organized churches and their affiliations and product&mdash;all
carefully and advisedly and legitimately because historically and
dogmatically interpreting the word of God) choosing to walk forth
and without ordination after any fashion conduct an unauthorized
and hence nondescript mission. Besides if she had remained at home,
as a good mother should, and devoted herself to her son, as well as
to her other children&mdash;their care and education&mdash;would
this&mdash;have happened?</p>

<p>And not only that&mdash;but according to Clyde's own testimony
in this trial, had he not been guilty of adultery with this
girl&mdash;whether he had slain her or not? A sin almost equal to
murder in many minds. Had he not confessed it? And was an appeal
for a convicted adulterer&mdash;if not murderer (who could tell as
to that?) to be made in a church? No,&mdash;no Christian church was
the place to debate, and for a charge, the merits of this case,
however much each Christian of each and every church might
sympathize with Mrs. Griffiths personally&mdash;or resent any legal
injustice that might have been done her son. No, no. It was not
morally advisable. It might even tend to implant in the minds of
the young some of the details of the crime.</p>

<p>Besides, because of what the newspapers had said of her coming
east to aid her son and the picture that she herself presented in
her homely garb, it was assumed by most ministers that she was one
of those erratic persons, not a constituent of any definite sect,
or schooled theology, who tended by her very appearance to cast
contempt on true and pure religion.</p>

<p>And in consequence, each in turn&mdash;not hardening his heart
exactly&mdash; but thinking twice&mdash;and deciding no&mdash;there
must be some better way&mdash; less troublesome to
Christians,&mdash;a public hall, perhaps, to which Christians, if
properly appealed to through the press, might well repair. And so
Mrs. Griffiths, in all but one instance, rejected in that fashion
and told to go elsewhere&mdash;while in regard to the
Catholics&mdash;instinctively&mdash;because of prejudice&mdash;as
well as a certain dull wisdom not inconsistent with the
facts&mdash;she failed even to so much as think of them. The
mercies of Christ as interpreted by the holder of the sacred keys
of St. Peter, as she knew, were not for those who failed to
acknowledge the authority of the Vicar of Christ.</p>

<p>And therefore after many days spent in futile knockings here and
there she was at last compelled&mdash;and in no little depression,
to appeal to a Jew who controlled the principal moving picture
theater of Utica&mdash;a sinful theater. And from him, this she
secured free for a morning address on the merits of her son's
case&mdash;"A mother's appeal for her son," it was
entitled&mdash;which netted her, at twenty-five cents per
person&mdash;the amazing sum of two hundred dollars. At first this
sum, small as it was, so heartened her that she was now convinced
that soon&mdash;whatever the attitude of the orthodox
Christians&mdash;she would earn enough for Clyde's appeal. It might
take time&mdash;but she would.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, as she soon discovered, there were other factors
to be considered&mdash;carfare, her own personal expenses in Utica
and elsewhere, to say nothing of certain very necessary sums to be
sent to Denver to her husband, who had little or nothing to go on
at present, and who, because of this very great tragedy in the
family, had been made ill&mdash;so ill indeed that the letters from
Frank and Julia were becoming very disturbing. It was possible that
he might not get well at all. Some help was necessary there.</p>

<p>And in consequence, in addition to paying her own expenses here,
Mrs. Griffiths was literally compelled to deduct other reducing
sums from this, her present and only source of income. It was
terrible&mdash;considering Clyde's predicament&mdash;but
nevertheless must she not sustain herself in every way in order to
win to victory? She could not reasonably abandon her husband in
order to aid Clyde alone.</p>

<p>Yet in the face of this&mdash;as time went on, the audiences
growing smaller and smaller until at last they constituted little
more than a handful&mdash;and barely paying her
expenses&mdash;although through this process none-the-less she
finally managed to put aside&mdash;over and above all her
expenses&mdash;eleven hundred dollars.</p>

<p>Yet, also, just at this time, and in a moment of extreme
anxiety, Frank and Julia wiring her that if she desired to see Asa
again she had better come home at once. He was exceedingly low and
not expected to live. Whereupon, played upon by these several
difficulties and there being no single thing other than to visit
him once or twice a week&mdash;as her engagements
permitted&mdash;which she could do for Clyde, she now hastily
conferred with Belknap and Jephson, setting forth her extreme
difficulties.</p>

<p>And these, seeing that eleven hundred dollars of all she had
thus far collected was to be turned over to them, now, in a burst
of humanity, advised her to return to her husband. Decidedly Clyde
would do well enough for the present seeing that there was an
entire year&mdash;or at least ten months before it was necessary to
file the record and the briefs in the case. In addition another
year assuredly must elapse before a decision could be reached. And
no doubt before that time the additional part of the appeal fee
could be raised. Or, if not&mdash;well, then&mdash;anyhow (seeing
how worn and distrait she was at this time) she need not worry.
Messrs. Belknap and Jephson would see to it that her son's
interests were properly protected. They would file an appeal and
make an argument&mdash;and do whatever else was necessary to insure
her son a fair hearing at the proper time.</p>

<p>And with that great burden off her mind&mdash;and two last
visits to Clyde in which she assured him of her determination to
return as speedily as possible&mdash;once Asa was restored to
strength again and she could see her way to financing such a
return&mdash;she now departed only to find that, once she was in
Denver once more, it was not so easy to restore him by any
means.</p>

<p>And in the meantime Clyde was left to cogitate on and make the
best of a world that at its best was a kind of inferno of mental
ills&mdash; above which&mdash;as above Dante's might have been
written&mdash;"abandon hope&mdash;ye who enter here."</p>

<p>The somberness of it. Its slow and yet searing psychic force!
The obvious terror and depression&mdash;constant and unshakeable of
those who, in spite of all their courage or their fears, their
bravado or their real indifference (there were even those) were
still compelled to think and wait. For, now, in connection with
this coldest and bitterest form of prison life he was in constant
psychic, if not physical contact, with twenty other convicted
characters of varying temperaments and nationalities, each one of
whom, like himself, had responded to some heat or lust or misery of
his nature or his circumstances. And with murder, a mental as well
as physical explosion, as the final outcome or concluding episode
which, being detected, and after what horrors and wearinesses of
mental as well as legal contest and failure, such as fairly
paralleled his own, now found themselves
islanded&mdash;immured&mdash;in one or another of these twenty-two
iron cages and awaiting&mdash;awaiting what?</p>

<p>How well they knew. And how well he knew. And here with what
loud public rages and despairs or prayers&mdash;at times. At
others&mdash;what curses&mdash;foal or coarse jests&mdash;or tales
addressed to all&mdash;or ribald laughter&mdash;or sighings and
groanings in these later hours when the straining spirit having
struggled to silence, there was supposedly rest for the body and
the spirit.</p>

<p>In an exercise court, beyond the farthermost end of the long
corridor, twice daily, for a few minutes each time, between the
hours of ten and five&mdash;the various inmates in groups of five
or six were led forth&mdash;to breathe, to walk, to practice
calisthenics&mdash;or run and leap as they chose. But always under
the watchful eyes of sufficient guards to master them in case they
attempted rebellion in any form. And to this it was, beginning with
the second day, that Clyde himself was led, now with one set of men
and now with another. But with the feeling at first strong in him
that he could not share in any of these public activities which,
nevertheless, these others&mdash;and in spite of their impending
doom&mdash;seemed willing enough to indulge in.</p>

<p>The two dark-eyed sinister-looking Italians, one of whom had
slain a girl because she would not marry him; the other who had
robbed and then slain and attempted to burn the body of his
father-in-law in order to get money for himself and his wife! And
big Larry Donahue&mdash;square-headed, square-shouldered&mdash;big
of feet and hands, an overseas soldier, who, being ejected from a
job as night watchman in a Brooklyn factory, had lain for the
foreman who had discharged him&mdash;and then killed him on an open
common somewhere at night, but without the skill to keep from
losing a service medal which had eventually served to betray and
identify him. Clyde had learned all this from the strangely
indifferent and non-committal, yet seemingly friendly guards, who
were over these cells by night and by day&mdash;two and two, turn
about&mdash;who relieved each other every eight hours. And police
officer Riordan of Rochester, who had killed his wife because she
was determined to leave him&mdash;and now, himself, was to die. And
Thomas Mowrer, the young "farmer" or farm hand, as he really was,
whom Clyde on his first night had heard moaning&mdash;a man who had
killed his employer with a pitchfork&mdash;and was soon to die
now&mdash;as Clyde heard, and who walked and walked, keeping close
to the wall&mdash;his head down, his hands behind his back&mdash;a
rude, strong, loutish man of about thirty, who looked more beaten
and betrayed than as though he had been able to torture or destroy
another. Clyde wondered about him&mdash;his real guilt.</p>

<p>Again Miller Nicholson, a lawyer of Buffalo of perhaps forty
years of age who was tall and slim and decidedly superior
looking&mdash;a refined, intellectual type, one you would have said
was no murderer&mdash;any more than Clyde&mdash;to look at, who,
none-the-less was convicted of poisoning an old man of great wealth
and afterwards attempting to convert his fortune to his own use.
Yet decidedly with nothing in his look or manner, as Clyde felt, at
least, which marked him as one so evil&mdash;a polite and courteous
man, who, noting Clyde on the very first morning of his arrival
here, approached and said: "Scared?" But in the most gentle and
solicitous tone, as Clyde could hear and feel, even though he stood
blank and icy&mdash; afraid almost to move&mdash;or think. Yet in
this mood&mdash;and because he felt so truly done for, replying:
"Yes, I guess I am." But once it was out, wondering why he had said
it (so weak a confession) and afterwards something in the man
heartening him, wishing that he had not.</p>

<p>"Your name's Griffiths, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well, my name's Nicholson. Don't be frightened. You'll get used
to it." He achieved a cheerful, if wan smile. But his
eyes&mdash;they did not seem like that&mdash;no smile there.</p>

<p>"I don't suppose I'm so scared either," replied Clyde, trying to
modify his first, quick and unintended confession.</p>

<p>"Well, that's good. Be game. We all have to be here&mdash;or the
whole place would go crazy. Better breathe a little. Or walk fast.
It'll do you good."</p>

<p>He moved away a few paces and began exercising his arms while
Clyde stood there, saying&mdash;almost loudly&mdash;so shaken was
he still: "We all have to be or the whole place would go crazy."
That was true, as he could see and feel after that first night.
Crazy, indeed. Tortured to death, maybe, by being compelled to
witness these terrible and completely destroying&mdash;and for
each&mdash;impending tragedies. But how long would he have to
endure this? How long would he?</p>

<p>In the course of a day or two, again he found this death house
was not quite like that either&mdash;not all terror&mdash;on the
surface at least. It was in reality&mdash;and in spite of impending
death in every instance, a place of taunt and jibe and
jest&mdash;even games, athletics, the stage&mdash;all forms of
human contest of skill&mdash;or the arguments on every conceivable
topic from death and women to lack of it, as far at least as the
general low intelligence of the group permitted.</p>

<p>For the most part, as soon as breakfast was over&mdash;among
those who were not called upon to join the first group for
exercise, there were checkers or cards, two games that were
played&mdash;not with a single set of checkers or a deck of cards
between groups released from their cells, but by one of the ever
present keepers providing two challenging prisoners (if it were
checkers) with one checker-board but no checkers. They were not
needed. Thereafter the opening move was called by one. "I move from
G 2 to E 1"&mdash;each square being numbered&mdash;each side
lettered. The moves checked with a pencil.</p>

<p>Thereafter the second party&mdash;having recorded this move on
his own board and having studied the effect of it on his own
general position, would call: "I move from E 7 to F 5." If more of
those present decided to join in this&mdash;either on one side or
the other, additional boards and pencils were passed to each
signifying his desire. Then Shorty Bristol, desiring to aid "Dutch"
Swighort, three cells down, might call: "I wouldn't do that, Dutch.
Wait a minute, there's a better move than that." And so on with
taunts, oaths, laughter, arguments, according to the varying
fortunes and difficulties of the game. And so, too, with cards.
These were played with each man locked in his cell, yet quite as
successfully.</p>

<p>But Clyde did not care for cards&mdash;or for these jibing and
coarse hours of conversation. There was for him&mdash;and with the
exception of the speech of one&mdash;Nicholson&mdash;alone, too
much ribald and even brutal talk which he could not appreciate. But
he was drawn to Nicholson. He was beginning to think after a
time&mdash;a few days&mdash; that this lawyer&mdash;his presence
and companionship during the exercise hour&mdash;whenever they
chanced to be in the same set&mdash;could help him to endure this.
He was the most intelligent and respectable man here. The others
were all so different&mdash;taciturn at times&mdash;and for the
most part so sinister, crude or remote.</p>

<p>But then and that not more than a week after his coming
here&mdash;and when, because of his interest in Nicholson, he was
beginning to feel slightly sustained at least&mdash;the execution
of Pasquale Cutrone, of Brooklyn, an Italian, convicted of the
slaying of his brother for attempting to seduce his wife. He had
one of the cells nearest the transverse passage, so Clyde learned
after arriving, and had in part lost his mind from worrying. At any
rate he was invariably left in his cell when the others&mdash;in
groups of six&mdash;were taken for exercise. But the horror of his
emaciated face, as Clyde passed and occasionally looked in&mdash;a
face divided into three grim panels by two gutters or prison lines
of misery that led from the eyes to the corners of the mouth.</p>

<p>Beginning with his, Clyde's arrival, as he learned, Pasquale had
begun to pray night and day. For already, before that, he had been
notified of the approximate date of his death which was to be
within the week. And after that he was given to crawling up and
down his cell on his hands and knees, kissing the floor, licking
the feet of a brass Christ on a cross that had been given him. Also
he was repeatedly visited by an Italian brother and sister fresh
from Italy and for whose benefit at certain hours, he was removed
to the old death house. But as all now whispered, Pasquale was
mentally beyond any help that might lie in brothers or sisters.</p>

<p>All night long and all day long, when they were not present, he
did this crawling to and fro and praying, and those who were awake
and trying to read to pass the time, were compelled to listen to
his mumbled prayers, the click of the beads of a rosary on which he
was numbering numberless Our Fathers and Hail Marys.</p>

<p>And though there were voices which occasionally said: "Oh, for
Christ's sake&mdash;if he would only sleep a little"&mdash;still
on, on. And the tap of his forehead on the floor&mdash;in prayer,
until at last the fatal day preceding the one on which he was to
die, when Pasquale was taken from his cell here and escorted to
another in the old death house beyond and where, before the
following morning, as Clyde later learned, last farewells, if any,
were to be said. Also he was to be allowed a few hours in which to
prepare his soul for his maker.</p>

<p>But throughout that night what a strange condition was this that
settled upon all who were of this fatal room. Few ate any supper as
the departing trays showed. There was silence&mdash;and after that
mumbled prayers on the part of some&mdash;not so greatly removed by
time from Pasquale's fate, as they knew. One Italian, sentenced for
the murder of a bank watchman, became hysterical, screamed, dashed
the chair and table of his cell against the bars of his door, tore
the sheets of his bed to shreds and even sought to strangle himself
before eventually he was overpowered and removed to a cell in a
different part of the building to be observed as to his sanity.</p>

<p>As for the others, throughout this excitement, one could hear
them walking and mumbling or calling to the guards to do something.
And as for Clyde, never having experienced or imagined such a
scene, he was literally shivering with fear and horror. All through
the last night of this man's life he lay on his pallet, chasing
phantoms. So this was what death was like here; men cried, prayed,
they lost their minds&mdash;yet the deadly process was in no way
halted, for all their terror. Instead, at ten o'clock and in order
to quiet all those who were left, a cold lunch was brought in and
offered&mdash;but with none eating save the Chinaman over the
way.</p>

<p>And then at four the following morning&mdash;the keepers in
charge of the deadly work coming silently along the main passage
and drawing the heavy green curtains with which the cells were
equipped so that none might see the fatal procession which was yet
to return along the transverse passage from the old death house to
the execution room. And yet with Clyde and all the others waking
and sitting up at the sound.</p>

<p>It was here, the execution! The hour of death was at hand. This
was the signal. In their separate cells, many of those who through
fear or contrition, or because of innate religious convictions, had
been recalled to some form of shielding or comforting faith, were
upon their knees praying. Among the rest were others who merely
walked or muttered. And still others who screamed from time to time
in an incontrollable fever of terror.</p>

<p>As for Clyde he was numb and dumb. Almost thoughtless. They were
going to kill that man in that other room in there. That
chair&mdash; that chair that he had so greatly feared this long
while was in there&mdash;was so close now. Yet his time as Jephson
and his mother had told him was so long and distant as yet&mdash;if
ever&mdash;ever it was to be&mdash;if ever&mdash;ever&mdash;</p>

<p>But now other sounds. Certain walkings to and fro. A cell door
clanking somewhere. Then plainly the door leading from the old
death house into this room opening&mdash;for there was a
voice&mdash;several voices indistinct as yet. Then another voice a
little clearer as if some one praying. That tell-tale shuffling of
feet as a procession moved across and through that passage. "Lord
have mercy. Christ have mercy."</p>

<p>"Mary, Mother of Grace, Mary, Mother of Mercy, St. Michael, pray
for me; my good Angel, pray for me."</p>

<p>"Holy Mary, pray for me; St. Joseph, pray for me. St. Ambrose,
pray for me; all ye saints and angels, pray for me."</p>

<p>"St. Michael, pray for me; my good Angel, pray for me."</p>

<p>It was the voice of the priest accompanying the doomed man and
reciting a litany. Yet he was no longer in his right mind they
said. And yet was not that his voice mumbling too? It was. Clyde
could tell. He had heard it too much recently. And now that other
door would be opened. He would be looking through it&mdash;this
condemned man&mdash;so soon to be dead&mdash;at it&mdash;seeing
it&mdash;that cap&mdash; those straps. Oh, he knew all about those
by now though they should never come to be put upon him, maybe.</p>

<p>"Good-by, Cutrone!" It was a hoarse, shaky voice from some
near-by cell&mdash;Clyde could not tell which. "Go to a better
world than this." And then other voices: "Goodby, Cutrone. God keep
you&mdash; even though you can't talk English."</p>

<p>The procession had passed. That door was shut. He was in there
now. They were strapping him in, no doubt. Asking him what more he
had to say&mdash;he who was no longer quite right in his mind. Now
the straps must be fastened on, surely. The cap pulled down. In a
moment, a moment, surely&mdash;</p>

<p>And then, although Clyde did not know or notice at the
moment&mdash;a sudden dimming of the lights in this room&mdash;as
well as over the prison&mdash;an idiotic or thoughtless result of
having one electric system to supply the death voltage and the
incandescence of this and all other rooms. And instantly a voice
calling:</p>

<p>"There she goes. That's one. Well, it's all over with him."</p>

<p>And a second voice: "Yes, he's topped off, poor devil."</p>

<p>And then after the lapse of a minute perhaps, a second dimming
lasting for thirty seconds&mdash;and finally a third dimming.</p>

<p>"There&mdash;sure&mdash;that's the end now."</p>

<p>"Yes. He knows what's on the other side now."</p>

<p>Thereafter silence&mdash;a deadly hush with later some murmured
prayers here and there. But with Clyde cold and with a kind of
shaking ague. He dared not think&mdash;let alone cry. So that's how
it was. They drew the curtains. And then&mdash;and then. He was
gone now. Those three dimmings of the lights. Sure, those were the
flashes. And after all those nights at prayer. Those moanings!
Those beatings of his head! And only a minute ago he had been
alive&mdash; walking by there. But now dead. And some day
he&mdash;he!&mdash;how could he be sure that he would not? How
could he?</p>

<p>He shook and shook, lying on his couch, face down. The keepers
came and ran up the curtains&mdash;as sure and secure in their
lives apparently as though there was no death in the world. And
afterwards he could hear them talking&mdash;not to him so
much&mdash;he had proved too reticent thus far&mdash;but to some of
the others.</p>

<p>Poor Pasquale. This whole business of the death penalty was all
wrong. The warden thought so. So did they. He was working to have
it abolished.</p>

<p>But that man! His prayers! And now he was gone. His cell over
there was empty and another man would be put in it&mdash;to go too,
later. Some one&mdash;many&mdash;like Cutrone, like
himself&mdash;had been in this one&mdash;on this pallet. He sat
up&mdash;moved to the chair. But he&mdash;they&mdash; had sat on
that&mdash;too. He stood up&mdash;only to sink down on the pallet
again. "God! God! God! God!" he now exclaimed to himself&mdash;but
not aloud&mdash;and yet not unlike that other man who had so
terrorized him on the night of his arrival here and who was still
here. But he would go too. And all of these others&mdash;and
himself maybe&mdash;unless&mdash; unless.</p>

<p>He had seen his first man die.</p>

<h3>Chapter 31</h3>

<p>In the meantime, however, Asa's condition had remained serious,
and it was four entire months before it was possible for him to sit
up again or for Mrs. Griffiths to dream of resuming her lecturing
scheme. But by that time, public interest in her and her son's fate
was considerably reduced. No Denver paper was interested to finance
her return for anything she could do for them. And as for the
public in the vicinity of the crime, it remembered Mrs. Griffiths
and her son most clearly, and in so far as she was concerned,
sympathetically&mdash;but only, on the other hand, to think of him
as one who probably was guilty and in that case, being properly
punished for his crime&mdash;that it would be as well if an appeal
were not taken&mdash;or&mdash;if it were&mdash;that it be refused.
These guilty criminals with their interminable appeals!</p>

<p>And with Clyde where he was, more and more
executions&mdash;although as he found&mdash;and to his invariable
horror, no one ever became used to such things there; farmhand
Mowrer for the slaying of his former employer; officer Riordan for
the slaying of his wife&mdash;and a fine upstanding officer too but
a minute before his death; and afterwards, within the month, the
going of the Chinaman, who seemed, for some reason, to endure a
long time (and without a word in parting to any one&mdash;although
it was well known that he spoke a few words of English). And after
him Larry Donahue, the overseas soldier&mdash;with a grand
call&mdash;just before the door closed behind: "Good-by boys. Good
luck."</p>

<p>And after him again&mdash;but, oh&mdash;that was so hard; so
much closer to Clyde&mdash;so depleting to his strength to think of
bearing this deadly life here without&mdash;Miller
Nicholson&mdash;no less. For after five months in which they had
been able to walk and talk and call to each other from time to time
from their cells and Nicholson had begun to advise him as to books
to read&mdash;as well as one important point in connection with his
own case&mdash;on appeal&mdash;or in the event of any second trial,
i.e.,&mdash;that the admission of Roberta's letters as evidence, as
they stood, at least, be desperately fought on the ground that the
emotional force of them was detrimental in the case of any jury
anywhere, to a calm unbiased consideration of the material facts
presented by them&mdash;and that instead of the letters being
admitted as they stood they should be digested for the facts alone
and that digest&mdash;and that only offered to the jury. "If your
lawyers can get the Court of Appeals to agree to the soundness of
that you will win your case sure."</p>

<p>And Clyde at once, after inducing a personal visit on the part
of Jephson, laying this suggestion before him and hearing him say
that it was sound and that he and Belknap would assuredly
incorporate it in their appeal.</p>

<p>Yet not so long after that the guard, after locking his door on
returning from the courtyard whispered, with a nod in the direction
of Nicholson's cell, "His next. Did he tell you? Within three
days."</p>

<p>And at once Clyde shriveling&mdash;the news playing upon him as
an icy and congealing breath. For he had just come from the
courtyard with him where they had walked and talked of another man
who had just been brought in&mdash;a Hungarian of Utica who was
convicted of burning his paramour&mdash;in a furnace&mdash;then
confessing it&mdash;a huge, rough, dark, ignorant man with a face
like a gargoyle. And Nicholson saying he was more animal than man,
he was sure. Yet no word about himself. And in <i>three days</i>!
And he could walk and talk as though there was nothing to happen,
although, according to the guard, he had been notified the night
before.</p>

<p>And the next day the same&mdash;walking and talking as though
nothing had happened&mdash;looking up at the sky and breathing the
air. Yet Clyde, his companion, too sick and feverish&mdash;too awed
and terrified from merely thinking on it all night to be able to
say much of anything as he walked but thinking: "And he can walk
here. And be so calm. What sort of a man is this?" and feeling
enormously overawed and weakened.</p>

<p>The following morning Nicholson did not appear&mdash;but
remained in his cell destroying many letters he had received from
many places. And near noon, calling to Clyde who was two cells
removed from him on the other side: "I'm sending you something to
remember me by." But not a word as to his going.</p>

<p>And then the guard bringing two books&mdash;Robinson Crusoe and
the Arabian Nights. That night Nicholson's removal from his
cell&mdash;and the next morning before dawn the curtains; the same
procession passing through, which was by now an old story to Clyde.
But somehow this was so different&mdash;so intimate&mdash;so cruel.
And as he passed, calling: "God bless you all. I hope you have good
luck and get out." And then that terrible stillness that followed
the passing of each man.</p>

<p>And Clyde thereafter&mdash;lonely&mdash;terribly so. Now there
was no one here&mdash;no one&mdash;in whom he was interested. He
could only sit and read&mdash;and think&mdash;or pretend to be
interested in what these others said, for he could not really be
interested in what they said. His was a mind that, freed from the
miseries that had now befallen him, was naturally more drawn to
romance than to reality. Where he read at all he preferred the
light, romantic novel that pictured some such world as he would
have liked to share, to anything that even approximated the hard
reality of the world without, let alone this. Now what was going to
become of him eventually? So alone was he! Only letters from his
mother, brother and sisters. And Asa getting no better, and his
mother not able to return as yet&mdash;things were so difficult
there in Denver. She was seeking a religious school in which to
teach somewhere&mdash;while nursing Asa. But she was asking the
Rev. Duncan McMillan, a young minister whom she had encountered in
Syracuse, in the course of her work there, to come and see him. He
was so spiritual and so kindly. And she was sure, if he would but
come, that Clyde would find him a helpful and a strong support in
these, his dark and weary hours when she could no longer be with
him herself.</p>

<p>For while Mrs. Griffiths was first canvassing the churches and
ministers of this section for aid for her son, and getting very
little from any quarter, she had met the Rev. Duncan McMillan in
Syracuse, where he was conducting an independent, non-sectarian
church. He was a young, and like herself or Asa, unordained
minister or evangelist of, however, far stronger and more effective
temperament religiously. At the time Mrs. Griffiths appeared on the
scene, he had already read much concerning Clyde and Roberta&mdash;
and was fairly well satisfied that, by the verdict arrived at,
justice had probably been done. However, because of her great
sorrow and troubled search for aid he was greatly moved.</p>

<p>He, himself, was a devoted son. And possessing a highly poetic
and emotional though so far repressed or sublimated sex nature, he
was one who, out of many in this northern region, had been touched
and stirred by the crime of which Clyde was presumed to be guilty.
Those highly emotional and tortured letters of Roberta's! Her
seemingly sad life at Lycurgus and Biltz! How often he had thought
of those before ever he had encountered Mrs. Griffiths. The simple
and worthy virtues which Roberta and her family had seemingly
represented in that romantic, pretty country world from which they
had derived. Unquestionably Clyde was guilty. And yet here,
suddenly, Mrs. Griffiths, very lorn and miserable and maintaining
her son's innocence. At the same time there was Clyde in his cell
doomed to die. Was it possible that by any strange freak or
circumstance&mdash;a legal mistake had been made and Clyde was not
as guilty as he appeared?</p>

<p>The temperament of McMillan was exceptional&mdash;tense, exotic.
A present hour St. Bernard, Savonarola, St. Simeon, Peter the
Hermit. Thinking of life, thought, all forms and social structures
as the word, the expression, the breath of God. No less. Yet room
for the Devil and his anger&mdash;the expelled Lucifer&mdash;going
to and fro in the earth. Yet, thinking on the Beatitudes, on the
Sermon on the Mount, on St. John and his direct seeing and
interpretation of Christ and God. "He that is not with me is
against me; and he that gathereth not with me, scattereth." A
strange, strong, tense, confused, merciful and too, after his
fashion beautiful soul; sorrowing with misery yearning toward an
impossible justice.</p>

<p>Mrs. Griffiths in her talks with him had maintained that he was
to remember that Roberta was not wholly guiltless. Had she not
sinned with her son? And how was he to exculpate her entirely? A
great legal mistake. Her son was being most unjustly
executed&mdash;and by the pitiful but none-the-less romantic and
poetic letters of this girl which should never have been poured
forth upon a jury of men at all. They were, as she now maintained,
incapable of judging justly or fairly where anything sad in
connection with a romantic and pretty girl was concerned. She had
found that to be true in her mission work.</p>

<p>And this idea now appealed to the Rev. Duncan as important and
very likely true. And perhaps, as she now contended, if only some
powerful and righteous emissary of God would visit Clyde and
through the force of his faith and God's word make him
see&mdash;which she was sure he did not yet, and which she in her
troubled state, and because she was his mother, could not make
him,&mdash;the blackness and terror of his sin with Roberta as it
related to his immortal soul here and hereafter,&mdash;then in
gratitude to, reverence and faith in God, would be washed away, all
his iniquity, would it not? For irrespective of whether he had
committed the crime now charged against him or not&mdash;and she
was convinced that he had not&mdash;was he not, nevertheless, in
the shadow of the electric chair&mdash;in danger at any time
through death (even before a decision should be reached) of being
called before his maker&mdash;and with the deadly sin of adultery,
to say nothing of all his lies and false conduct, not only in
connection with Roberta but that other girl there in Lycurgus, upon
him? And by conversion and contrition should he not be purged of
this? If only his soul were saved&mdash;she and he too would be at
peace in this world.</p>

<p>And after a first and later a second pleading letter from Mrs.
Griffiths, in which, after she had arrived at Denver, she set forth
Clyde's loneliness and need of counsel and aid, the Rev. Duncan
setting forth for Auburn. And once there&mdash;having made it clear
to the warden what his true purpose was&mdash;the spiritual
salvation of Clyde's soul, for his own, as well as his mother and
God's sake, he was at once admitted to the death house and to
Clyde's presence&mdash; the very door of his cell, where he paused
and looked through, observing Clyde lying most wretchedly on his
cot trying to read. And then McMillan outlining his tall, thin
figure against the bars and without introduction of any kind,
beginning, his head bowed in prayer:<br>
<br></p>

<p>"Have mercy upon me, O God, according to Thy loving-kindness;
according unto the multitude of Thy tender mercies, blot out my
transgressions."</p>

<p>"Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity and cleanse me from my
sin."</p>

<p>"For I acknowledge my transgressions, and my sin is ever before
me."</p>

<p>"Against Thee, Thee only have I sinned, and done this evil in
Thy sight, that Thou mightest be justified when Thou speakest and
be clear when Thou judgest."</p>

<p>"Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother
conceive me."</p>

<p>"Behold, Thou desireth truth in the inward parts; and in the
hidden part Thou shalt make me to know wisdom."</p>

<p>"Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean; wash me, and I
shall be whiter than snow."</p>

<p>"Make me to hear joy and gladness; that the bones which Thou
hast broken may rejoice."</p>

<p>"Hide Thy face from my sins, and blot out all mine
iniquities."</p>

<p>"Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit
within me."</p>

<p>"Cast me not away from Thy presence; and take not Thy holy
spirit away from me."</p>

<p>"Restore unto me the joy of Thy salvation, and uphold me with
Thy free spirit."</p>

<p>"Then will I teach transgressors Thy ways; and sinners will be
converted unto Thee."</p>

<p>"Deliver me from blood guiltiness, O God, thou God of my
salvation, and my tongue shall sing aloud of Thy
righteousness."</p>

<p>"O Lord, open Thou my lips; and my mouth shall show forth Thy
praise."</p>

<p>"For Thou desirest not sacrifice; else would I give it; Thou
delightest not in burnt offering."</p>

<p>"The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; a broken and a
contrite heart, O God, Thou wilt not despise."<br>
<br></p>

<p>He paused&mdash;but only after he had intoned, and in a most
sonorous and really beautiful voice the entire 51st Psalm. And then
looking up, because Clyde, much astonished, had first sat up and
then risen&mdash;and curiously enticed by the clean and youthful
and vigorous if pale figure had approached nearer the cell door, he
now added:</p>

<p>"I bring you, Clyde, the mercy and the salvation of your God. He
has called on me and I have come. He has sent me that I may say
unto you though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be
white&mdash;like snow. Though they be red, like crimson, they shall
be as wool. Come now, let us reason together with the Lord."</p>

<p>He paused and stared at Clyde tenderly. A warm, youthful, half
smile, half romantic, played about his lips. He liked the youth and
refinement of Clyde, who, on his part was plainly taken by this
exceptional figure. Another religionist, of course. But the
Protestant chaplain who was here was nothing like this
man&mdash;neither so arresting nor attractive.</p>

<p>"Duncan McMillan is my name," he said, "and I come from the work
of the Lord in Syracuse. He has sent me&mdash;just as he sent your
mother to me. She has told me all that she believes. I have read
all that you have said. And I know why you are here. But it is to
bring you spiritual joy and gladness that I am here."</p>

<p>And he suddenly quoted from Psalms 13:2, "'How shall I take
counsel in my soul, having sorrow in my heart, daily.' That is from
Psalms 13:2. And here is another thing that now comes to me as
something that I should say to you. It is from the Bible,
too&mdash;the Tenth Psalm: 'He hath said in his heart, I shall not
be moved, for I shall never be in adversity.' But you are in
adversity, you see. We all are, who live in sin. And here is
another thing that comes to me, just now to say. It is from Psalm
10:11: 'He hath said in his heart, God hath forgotten. He hideth
His face.' And I am told to say to you that He does not hide His
face. Rather I am told to quote this to you from the Eighteenth
Psalm: 'They prevented me in the day of my calamity, but the Lord
was my stay. He sent from above, He took me, He drew me out of many
waters.'</p>

<p>"'He delivered me from my strong enemy.</p>

<p>"'And from them which hated me, for they were too many for
me.</p>

<p>"'He brought me forth also unto a large place.</p>

<p>"'He delivered me because He delighted in me.'</p>

<p>"Clyde, those are all words addressed to you. They come to me
here to say to you just as though they were being whispered to me.
I am but the mouthpiece for these words spoken direct to you. Take
counsel with your own heart. Turn from the shadow to the light. Let
us break these bonds of misery and gloom; chase these shadows and
this darkness. You have sinned. The Lord can and will forgive.
Repent. Join with Him who has shaped the world and keeps it. He
will not spurn your faith; He will not neglect your prayers.
Turn&mdash;in yourself&mdash;in the confines of this cell&mdash;and
say: 'Lord, help me. Lord, hear Thou my prayer. Lord, lighten mine
eyes!'</p>

<p>"Do you think there is no God&mdash;and that He will not answer
you? Pray. In your trouble turn to Him&mdash;not me&mdash;or any
other. But to Him. Pray. Speak to Him. Call to Him. Tell Him the
truth and ask for help. As surely as you are here before
me&mdash;and if in your heart you truly repent of any evil you have
done&mdash;<i>truly, truly</i>, you will hear and feel Him. He will
take your hand. He will enter this cell and your soul. You will
know Him by the peace and the light that will fill your mind and
heart. Pray. And if you need me again to help you in any
way&mdash;to pray with you&mdash;or to do you any service of any
kind&mdash;to cheer you in your loneliness&mdash;you have only to
send for me; drop me a card. I have promised your mother and I will
do what I can. The warden has my address." He paused, serious and
conclusive in his tone&mdash;because up to this time, Clyde had
looked more curious and astonished than anything else.</p>

<p>At the same time because of Clyde's extreme youthfulness and a
certain air of lonely dependence which marked him ever since his
mother and Nicholson had gone: "I'll always be in easy reach. I
have a lot of religious work over in Syracuse but I'll be glad to
drop it at any time that I can really do anything more for you."
And here he turned as if to go.</p>

<p>But Clyde, now taken by him&mdash;his vital, confident and
kindly manner&mdash;so different to the tense, fearful and yet
lonely life here, called after him: "Oh, don't go just yet. Please
don't. It's very nice of you to come and see me and I'm obliged to
you. My mother wrote me you might. You see, it's very lonely here.
I haven't thought much of what you were saying, perhaps, because I
haven't felt as guilty as some think I am. But I've been sorry
enough. And certainly any one in here pays a good deal." His eyes
looked very sad and strained.</p>

<p>And at once, McMillan, now deeply touched for the first time
replied: "Clyde, you needn't worry. I'll come to see you again
within a week, because now I see you need me. I'm not asking you to
pray because I think you are guilty of the death of Roberta Alden.
I don't know. You haven't told me. Only you and God know what your
sins and your sorrows are. But I do know you need spiritual help
and He will give you that&mdash;oh, fully. 'The Lord will be a
refuge for the oppressed; a refuge in time of trouble.'"</p>

<p>He smiled as though he were now really fond of Clyde. And Clyde
feeling this and being intrigued by it, replied that there wasn't
anything just then that he wanted to say except to tell his mother
that he was all right&mdash;and make her feel a little better about
him, maybe, if he could. Her letters were very sad, he thought. She
worried too much about him. Besides he, himself, wasn't feeling so
very good&mdash;not a little run down and worried these days. Who
wouldn't be in his position? Indeed, if only he could win to
spiritual peace through prayer, he would be glad to do it. His
mother had always urged him to pray&mdash;but up to now he was
sorry to say he hadn't followed her advice very much. He looked
very distrait and gloomy&mdash;the marked prison pallor having long
since settled on his face.</p>

<p>And the Reverend Duncan, now very much touched by his state,
replied: "Well, don't worry, Clyde. Enlightenment and peace are
surely going to come to you. I can see that. You have a Bible
there, I see. Open it anywhere in Psalms and read. The 51st, 91st,
23rd. Open to St. John. Read it all&mdash;over and over. Think and
pray&mdash;and think on all the things about you&mdash;the moon,
the stars, the sun, the trees, the sea&mdash;your own beating
heart, your body and strength&mdash;and ask yourself who made them.
How did they come to be? Then, if you can't explain them, ask
yourself if the one who made them and you&mdash;whoever he is,
whatever he is, wherever he is, isn't strong and wise enough and
kind enough to help you when you need help&mdash;provide you with
light and peace and guidance, when you need them. Just ask yourself
what of the Maker of all this certain reality. And then ask
Him&mdash;the Creator of it all&mdash;to tell you how and what to
do. Don't doubt. Just ask and see. Ask in the night&mdash;in the
day. Bow your head and pray and see. Verily, He will not fail you.
I know because I have that peace."</p>

<p>He stared at Clyde convincingly&mdash;then smiled and departed.
And Clyde, leaning against his cell door, began to wonder. The
Creator! His Creator! The Creator of the World!...Ask and
see&mdash;!</p>

<p>And yet&mdash;there was still lingering here in him that old
contempt of his for religion and its fruits,&mdash;the constant and
yet fruitless prayers and exhortations of his father and mother.
Was he going to turn to religion now, solely because he was in
difficulties and frightened like these others? He hoped not. Not
like that, anyway.</p>

<p>Just the same the mood, as well as the temperament of the
Reverend Duncan McMillan&mdash;his young, forceful, convinced and
dramatic body, face, eyes, now intrigued and then moved Clyde as no
religionist or minister in all his life before ever had. He was
interested, arrested and charmed by the man's faith&mdash;whether
at once or not at all&mdash;ever&mdash;he could come to put the
reliance in it that plainly this man did.</p>

<h3>Chapter 32</h3>

<p>The personal conviction and force of such an individual as the
Reverend McMillan, while in one sense an old story to Clyde and not
anything which so late as eighteen months before could have moved
him in any way (since all his life he had been accustomed to
something like it), still here, under these circumstances, affected
him differently. Incarcerated, withdrawn from the world, compelled
by the highly circumscribed nature of this death house life to find
solace or relief in his own thoughts, Clyde's, like every other
temperament similarly limited, was compelled to devote itself
either to the past, the present or the future. But the past was so
painful to contemplate at any point. It seared and burned. And the
present (his immediate surroundings) as well as the future with its
deadly fear of what was certain to happen in case his appeal
failed, were two phases equally frightful to his waking
consciousness.</p>

<p>What followed then was what invariably follows in the wake of
every tortured consciousness. From what it dreads or hates, yet
knows or feels to be unescapable, it takes refuge in that which may
be hoped for&mdash;or at least imagined. But what was to be hoped
for or imagined? Because of the new suggestion offered by
Nicholson, a new trial was all that he had to look forward to, in
which case, and assuming himself to be acquitted thereafter, he
could go far, far away&mdash;to Australia&mdash;or Africa&mdash;or
Mexico&mdash;or some such place as that, where, under a different
name&mdash;his old connections and ambitions relating to that
superior social life that had so recently intrigued him, laid
aside, he might recover himself in some small way. But directly in
the path of that hopeful imagining, of course, stood the death's
head figure of a refusal on the part of the Court of Appeals to
grant him a new trial. Why not&mdash;after that jury at Bridgeburg?
And then&mdash;as in that dream in which he turned from the tangle
of snakes to face the tramping rhinoceros with its two
horns&mdash;he was confronted by that awful thing in the adjoining
room&mdash;that chair! That chair! Its straps and its flashes which
so regularly dimmed the lights in this room. He could not bear to
think of his entering there&mdash;ever. And yet supposing his
appeal was refused! Away! He would like to think no more about
it.</p>

<p>But then, apart from that what was there to think of? It was
that very question that up to the time of the arrival of the Rev.
Duncan McMillan, with his plea for a direct and certainly (as he
insisted) fruitful appeal to the Creator of all things, that had
been definitely torturing Clyde. Yet see&mdash;how simple was his
solution!</p>

<p>"It was given unto you to know the Peace of God," he insisted,
quoting Paul and thereafter sentences from Corinthians, Galatians,
Ephesians, on how easy it was&mdash;if Clyde would but repeat and
pray as he had asked him to&mdash;for him to know and delight in
the "peace that passeth all understanding." It was with him, all
around him. He had but to seek; confess the miseries and errors of
his heart, and express contrition. "Ask, and ye shall receive;
seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.
For <i>every one</i> that asketh, receiveth; and he that seeketh,
findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened. For what man
is there of you whom, if his son ask bread, will give him a stone;
or, if he ask fish, will give him a serpent?" So he quoted,
beautifully and earnestly.</p>

<p>And yet before Clyde always was the example of his father and
mother. What had they? It had not availed them much&mdash;praying.
Neither, as he noticed here, did it appear to avail or aid these
other condemned men, the majority of whom lent themselves to the
pleas or prayers of either priest or rabbi or minister, one and the
other of whom was about daily. Yet were they not led to their death
just the same&mdash;and complaining or protesting, or mad like
Cutrone, or indifferent? As for himself, up to this he had not been
interested by any of these. Bunk. Notions. Of what? He could not
say. Nevertheless, here was the appealing Rev. Duncan McMillan. His
mild, serene eyes. His sweet voice. His faith. It moved and
intrigued Clyde deeply. Could there&mdash;could there? He was so
lonely&mdash;so despairing&mdash;so very much in need of help.</p>

<p>Was it not also true (the teaching of the Rev. McMillan&mdash;
influencing him to that extent at least) that if he had led a
better life&mdash;had paid more attention to what his mother had
said and taught&mdash;not gone into that house of prostitution in
Kansas City&mdash;or pursued Hortense Briggs in the evil way that
he had&mdash;or after her, Roberta&mdash;had been content to work
and save, as no doubt most men were&mdash;would he not be better
off than he now was? But then again, there was the fact or truth of
those very strong impulses and desires within himself that were so
very, very hard to overcome. He had thought of those, too, and then
of the fact that many other people like his mother, his uncle, his
cousin, and this minister here, did not seem to be troubled by
them. And yet also he was given to imagining at times that perhaps
it was because of superior mental and moral courage in the face of
passions and desires, equivalent to his own, which led these others
to do so much better. He was perhaps just willfully devoting
himself to these other thoughts and ways, as his mother and
McMillan and most every one else whom he had heard talk since his
arrest seemed to think.</p>

<p>What did it all mean? Was there a God? Did He interfere in the
affairs of men as Mr. McMillan was now contending? Was it possible
that one could turn to Him, or at least some creative power, in
some such hour as this and when one had always ignored Him before,
and ask for aid? Decidedly one needed aid under such
circumstances&mdash; so alone and ordered and controlled by
law&mdash;not man&mdash;since these, all of them, were the veriest
servants of the law. But would this mysterious power be likely to
grant aid? Did it really exist and hear the prayers of men? The
Rev. McMillan insisted yes. "He hath said God hath forgotten; He
hideth His face. But He has not forgotten. He has not hidden His
face." But was that true? Was there anything to it? Tortured by the
need of some mental if not material support in the face of his
great danger, Clyde was now doing what every other human in related
circumstances invariably does&mdash;seeking, and yet in the most
indirect and involute and all but unconscious way, the presence or
existence at least of some superhuman or supernatural personality
or power that could and would aid him in some way&mdash;beginning
to veer&mdash;however slightly or unconsciously as
yet,&mdash;toward the personalization and humanization of forces,
of which, except in the guise of religion, he had not the faintest
conception. "The Heavens declare the Glory of God, and the
Firmament sheweth His handiwork." He recalled that as a placard in
one of his mother's mission windows. And another which read: "For
He is Thy life and Thy length of Days." Just the same&mdash;and far
from it as yet, even in the face of his sudden predisposition
toward the Rev. Duncan McMillan, was he seriously moved to assume
that in religion of any kind was he likely to find surcease from
his present miseries?</p>

<p>And yet the weeks and months going by&mdash;the Rev. McMillan
calling regularly thereafter, every two weeks at the longest,
sometimes every week and inquiring after his state, listening to
his wants, advising him as to his health and peace of mind. And
Clyde, anxious to retain his interest and visits, gradually, more
and more, yielding himself to his friendship and influence. That
high spirituality. That beautiful voice. And quoting always such
soothing things. "Brethren <i>now</i> are we the children of God.
And it doth not yet appear what we shall be; but we know that when
He shall appear we shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He
is. And every man that has this hope in him purifieth himself even
as He is pure."</p>

<p>"Hereby know that we dwell in Him and He in us, because He hath
given us of His spirit."</p>

<p>"For ye are bought with a price."</p>

<p>"Of His own will begot He us with the word of truth, and we
should be a kind of first fruits of His creatures. And every good
and every perfect gift is from above and cometh down from the
Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of
turning."</p>

<p>"Draw nigh unto God and He will draw nigh unto you."</p>

<p>He was inclined, at times, to feel that there might be peace and
strength&mdash;aid, even&mdash;who could say, in appealing to this
power. It was the force and the earnestness of the Rev. McMillan
operating upon him.</p>

<p>And yet, the question of repentance&mdash;and with it
confession. But to whom? The Rev. Duncan McMillan, of course. He
seemed to feel that it was necessary for Clyde to purge his soul to
him&mdash;or some one like him&mdash;a material and yet spiritual
emissary of God. But just there was the trouble. For there was all
of that false testimony he had given in the trial, yet on which had
been based his appeal. To go back on that now, and when his appeal
was pending. Better wait, had he not, until he saw how that appeal
had eventuated.</p>

<p>But, ah, how shabby, false, fleeting, insincere. To imagine that
any God would bother with a person who sought to dicker in such a
way. No, no. That was not right either. What would the Rev.
McMillan think of him if he knew what he was thinking?</p>

<p>But again there was the troubling question in his own mind as to
his real guilt&mdash;the amount of it. True there was no doubt that
he had plotted to kill Roberta there at first&mdash;a most dreadful
thing as he now saw it. For the complications and the fever in
connection with his desire for Sondra having subsided somewhat, it
was possible on occasion now for him to reason without the
desperate sting and tang of the mental state that had characterized
him at the time when he was so immediately in touch with her. Those
terrible, troubled days when in spite of himself&mdash;as he now
understood it (Belknap's argument having cleared it up for him) he
had burned with that wild fever which was not unakin in its
manifestations to a form of insanity. The beautiful Sondra! The
glorious Sondra! The witchery and fire of her smile then! Even now
that dreadful fever was not entirely out but only smoldering&mdash;
smothered by all of the dreadful things that had since happened to
him.</p>

<p>Also, it must be said on his behalf now, must it not&mdash;that
never, under any other circumstances, would he have succumbed to
any such terrible thought or plot as that&mdash;to kill any
one&mdash;let alone a girl like Roberta&mdash;unless he had been so
infatuated&mdash;lunatic, even. But had not the jury there at
Bridgeburg listened to that plea with contempt? And would the Court
of Appeals think differently? He feared not. And yet was it not
true? Or was he all wrong? Or what? Could the Rev. McMillan or any
one else to whom he would explain tell him as to that? He would
like to talk to him about it&mdash;confess everything perhaps, in
order to get himself clear on all this. Further, there was the fact
that having plotted for Sondra's sake (and God, if no one else,
knew that) he still had not been able to execute it. And that had
not been brought out in the trial, because the false form of
defense used permitted no explanation of the real truth
then&mdash;and yet it was a mitigating circumstance, was it
not&mdash;or would the Rev. McMillan think so? A lie had to be
used, as Jephson saw it. But did that make it any the less
true?</p>

<p>There were phases of this thing, the tangles and doubts involved
in that dark, savage plot of his, as he now saw and brooded on it,
which were not so easily to be disposed of. Perhaps the two worst
were, first, that in bringing Roberta there to that point on that
lake&mdash;that lone spot&mdash;and then growing so weak and
furious with himself because of his own incapacity to do evil, he
had frightened her into rising and trying to come to him. And that
in the first instance made it possible for her to be thus
accidentally struck by him and so made him, in part at least,
guilty of that blow&mdash;or did it?&mdash;a murderous, sinful blow
in that sense. Maybe. What would the Rev. McMillan say to that? And
since because of that she had fallen into the water, was he not
guilty of her falling? It was a thought that troubled him very much
now&mdash;his constructive share of guilt in all that. Regardless
of what Oberwaltzer had said there at the trial in regard to his
swimming away from her&mdash;that if she had accidentally fallen in
the water, it was no crime on his part, supposing he refused to
rescue her,&mdash;still, as he now saw it, and especially when
taken in connection with all that he had thought in regard to
Roberta up to that moment, it was a crime just the same, was it
not? Wouldn't God&mdash;McMillan&mdash;think so? And
unquestionably, as Mason had so shrewdly pointed out at the trial,
he might have saved her. And would have too, no doubt, if she had
been Sondra&mdash; or even the Roberta of the summer before.
Besides, the fear of her dragging him down had been no decent fear.
(It was at nights in his bunk at this time that he argued and
reasoned with himself, seeing that McMillan was urging him now to
repent and make peace with his God.) Yes, he would have to admit
that to himself. Decidedly and instantly he would have sought to
save her life, if it had been Sondra. And such being the case, he
would have to confess that&mdash;if he confessed at all to the Rev.
McMillan&mdash;or to whomever else one told the truth&mdash;when
one did tell it&mdash;the public at large perhaps. But such a
confession once made, would it not surely and truly lead to his
conviction? And did he want to convict himself now and so die?</p>

<p>No, no, better wait a while perhaps&mdash;at least until the
Court of Appeals had passed on his case. Why jeopardize his case
when God already knew what the truth was? Truly, truly he was
sorry. He could see how terrible all this was now&mdash;how much
misery and heartache, apart from the death of Roberta, he had
caused. But still&mdash;still&mdash;was not life sweet? Oh, if he
could only get out! Oh, if he could only go away from
here&mdash;never to see or hear or feel anything more of this
terrible terror that now hung over him. The slow coming
dark&mdash;the slow coming dawn. The long night! The
sighs&mdash;the groans. The tortures by day and by night until it
seemed at times as though he should go mad; and would perhaps
except for McMillan, who now appeared devoted to him&mdash;so kind,
appealing and reassuring, too, at times. He would just like to sit
down some day&mdash;here or somewhere&mdash;and tell him all and
get him to say how really guilty, if at all, he thought him to
be&mdash;and if so guilty to get him to pray for him. At times he
felt so sure that his mother's and the Rev. Duncan McMillan's
prayers would do him so much more good with this God than any
prayers of his own would. Somehow he couldn't pray yet. And at
times hearing McMillan pray, softly and melodiously, his voice
entering through the bars&mdash;or, reading from Galatians,
Thessalonians, Corinthians, he felt as though he must tell him
everything, and soon.</p>

<p>But the days going by until finally one day six weeks
after&mdash;and when because of his silence in regard to himself,
the Rev. Duncan was beginning to despair of ever affecting him in
any way toward his proper contrition and salvation&mdash;a letter
or note from Sondra. It came through the warden's office and by the
hand of the Rev. Preston Guilford, the Protestant chaplain of the
prison, but was not signed. It was, however, on good paper, and
because the rule of the prison so requiring had been opened and
read. Nevertheless, on account of the nature of the contents which
seemed to both the warden and the Rev. Guilford to be more
charitable and punitive than otherwise, and because plainly, if not
verifiably, it was from that Miss X of repute or notoriety in
connection with his trial, it was decided, after due deliberation,
that Clyde should be permitted to read it&mdash;even that it was
best that he should. Perhaps it would prove of value as a lesson.
The way of the transgressor. And so it was handed to him at the
close of a late fall day&mdash;after a long and dreary summer had
passed (soon a year since he had entered here). And he taking it.
And although it was typewritten with no date nor place on the
envelope, which was postmarked New York&mdash;yet sensing somehow
that it might be from her. And growing decidedly nervous&mdash;so
much so that his hand trembled slightly. And then
reading&mdash;over and over and over&mdash;during many days
thereafter: "Clyde&mdash;This is so that you will not think that
some one once dear to you has utterly forgotten you. She has
suffered much, too. And though she can never understand how you
could have done as you did, still, even now, although she is never
to see you again, she is not without sorrow and sympathy and wishes
you freedom and happiness."</p>

<p>But no signature&mdash;no trace of her own handwriting. She was
afraid to sign her name and she was too remote from him in her mood
now to let him know where she was. New York! But it might have been
sent there from anywhere to mail. And she would not let him
know&mdash;would never let him know&mdash;even though he died here
later, as well he might. His last hope&mdash;the last trace of his
dream vanished. Forever! It was at that moment, as when night at
last falls upon the faintest remaining gleam of dusk in the west. A
dim, weakening tinge of pink&mdash;and then the dark.</p>

<p>He seated himself on his cot. The wretched stripes of his
uniform and his gray felt shoes took his eye. A felon. These
stripes. These shoes. This cell. This uncertain, threatening
prospect so very terrible to contemplate at any time. And then this
letter. So this was the end of all that wonderful dream! And for
this he had sought so desperately to disengage himself from
Roberta&mdash;even to the point of deciding to slay her. This!
This! He toyed with the letter, then held it quite still. Where was
she now? Who in love with, maybe? She had had time to change
perhaps. She had only been captivated by him a little, maybe. And
then that terrible revelation in connection with him had destroyed
forever, no doubt, all sentiment in connection with him. She was
free. She had beauty&mdash;wealth. Now some other&mdash;</p>

<p>He got up and walked to his cell door to still a great pain.
Over the way, in that cell the Chinaman had once occupied, was a
Negro&mdash; Wash Higgins. He had stabbed a waiter in a restaurant,
so it was said, who had refused him food and then insulted him. And
next to him was a young Jew. He had killed the proprietor of a
jewelry store in trying to rob it. But he was very broken and
collapsed now that he was here to die&mdash;sitting for the most
part all day on his cot, his head in his hands. Clyde could see
both now from where he stood&mdash;the Jew holding his head. But
the Negro on his cot, one leg above the other, smoking&mdash;and
singing&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"Oh, big wheel ro-a-lin'...hmp!<br>
Oh, big wheel ro-a-lin'...hmp!<br>
Oh, big wheel ro-a-lin'...hmp!<br>
Foh me! Foh me!"</blockquote>

<p>And then Clyde, unable to get away from his own thoughts,
turning again.</p>

<p>Condemned to die! He. And this was the end as to Sondra. He
could feel it. Farewell. "Although she is never to see you again."
He threw himself on his couch&mdash;not to weep but to
rest&mdash;he felt so weary. Lycurgus. Fourth Lake. Bear Lake.
Laughter&mdash; kisses&mdash;smiles. What was to have been in the
fall of the preceding year. And now&mdash;a year later.</p>

<p>But then,&mdash;that young Jew. There was some religious chant
into which he fell when his mental tortures would no longer endure
silence. And oh, how sad. Many of the prisoners had cried out
against it. And yet, oh, how appropriate now, somehow.</p>

<p>"I have been evil. I have been unkind. I have lied. Oh! Oh! Oh!
I have been unfaithful. My heart has been wicked. I have joined
with those who have done evil things. Oh! Oh! Oh! I have stolen. I
have been false. I have been cruel! Oh! Oh! Oh!"</p>

<p>And the voice of Big Tom Rooney sentenced for killing Thomas
Tighe, a rival for the hand of an underworld girl. "For Christ's
sake! I know you feel bad. But so do I. Oh, for God's sake, don't
do that!"</p>

<p>Clyde, on his cot, his thoughts responding rhythmically to the
chant of the Jew&mdash;and joining with him silently&mdash;"I have
been evil. I have been unkind. I have lied. Oh! Oh! Oh! I have been
unfaithful. My heart has been wicked. I have joined with those who
have done evil things. Oh! Oh! Oh! I have been false. I have been
cruel. I have sought to murder. Oh! Oh! Oh! And for what? A
vain&mdash;impossible dream! Oh! Oh! Oh!...Oh! Oh! Oh!..."</p>

<p>When the guard, an hour later, placed his supper on the shelf in
the door, he made no move. Food! And when the guard returned in
another thirty minutes, there it was, still untouched, as was the
Jew's&mdash;and was taken away in silence. Guards knew when blue
devils had seized the inmates of these cages. They couldn't eat.
And there were times, too, when even guards couldn't eat.</p>

<h3>Chapter 33</h3>

<p>The depression resulting even after two days was apparent to the
Reverend McMillan, who was concerned to know why. More recently, he
had been led to believe by Clyde's manner, his visits, if not the
fact that the totality of his preachments, had not been greeted
with as much warmth as he would have liked, that by degrees Clyde
was being won to his own spiritual viewpoint. With no little
success, as it had seemed to him, he had counseled Clyde as to the
folly of depression and despair. "What! Was not the peace of God
within his grasp and for the asking. To one who sought God and
found Him, as he surely would, if he sought, there could be no
sorrow, but only joy. 'Hereby know we that we dwell in Him, and He
in us, because He hath given us of His spirit.'" So he preached or
read,&mdash;until finally&mdash;two weeks after receiving the
letter from Sondra and because of the deep depression into which he
had sunk on account of it, Clyde was finally moved to request of
him that he try to induce the warden to allow him to be taken to
some other cell or room apart from this room or cell which seemed
to Clyde to be filled with too many of his tortured thoughts, in
order that he might talk with him and get his advice. As he told
the Reverend McMillan, he did not appear to be able to solve his
true responsibility in connection with all that had so recently
occurred in his life, and because of which he seemed not to be able
to find that peace of mind of which McMillan talked so much.
Perhaps...,&mdash;there must be something wrong with his viewpoint.
Actually he would like to go over the offense of which he was
convicted and see if there was anything wrong in his understanding
of it. He was not so sure now. And McMillan, greatly
stirred,&mdash;an enormous spiritual triumph, this&mdash;as he saw
it&mdash;the true reward of faith and prayer, at once proceeding to
the warden, who was glad enough to be of service in such a cause.
And he permitted the use of one of the cells in the old death house
for as long as he should require, and with no guard between himself
and Clyde&mdash;one only remaining in the general hall outside.</p>

<p>And there Clyde began the story of his relations with Roberta
and Sondra. Yet because of all that had been set forth at the
trial, merely referring to most of the evidence&mdash;apart from
his defense&mdash; the change of heart, as so; afterwards dwelling
more particularly on the fatal adventure with Roberta in the boat.
Did the Reverend McMillan&mdash;because of the original
plotting&mdash;and hence the original intent&mdash;think him
guilty?&mdash;especially in view of his obsession over
Sondra&mdash;all his dreams in regard to her&mdash;did that truly
constitute murder? He was asking this because, as he said, it was
as he had done&mdash;not as his testimony at the trial had
indicated that he had done. It was a lie that he had experienced a
change of heart. His attorneys had counseled that defense as best,
since they did not feel that he was guilty, and had thought that
plan the quickest route to liberty. But it was a lie. In connection
with his mental state also there in the boat, before and after her
rising and attempting to come to him,&mdash;and that blow, and
after,&mdash;he had not told the truth either&mdash;quite. That
unintentional blow, as he now wished to explain, since it affected
his efforts at religious meditation,&mdash;a desire to present
himself honestly to his Creator, if at all (he did not then explain
that as yet he had scarcely attempted to so present
himself)&mdash;there was more to it than he had been able yet to
make clear, even to himself. In fact even now to himself there was
much that was evasive and even insoluble about it. He had said that
there had been no anger&mdash;that there had been a change of
heart. But there had been no change of heart. In fact, just before
she had risen to come to him, there had been a complex troubled
state, bordering, as he now saw it, almost upon trance or palsy,
and due&mdash;but he could scarcely say to what it was due,
exactly. He had thought at first&mdash;or afterwards&mdash;that it
was partly due to pity for Roberta&mdash;or, at least the shame of
so much cruelty in connection with her&mdash;his plan to strike
her. At the same time there was anger, too,&mdash;hate
maybe&mdash;because of her determination to force him to do what he
did not wish to do. Thirdly&mdash;yet he was not so sure as to
that&mdash;(he had thought about it so long and yet he was not sure
even now)&mdash;there might have been fear as to the consequences
of such an evil deed&mdash;although, just at that time, as it
seemed to him now, he was not thinking of the consequences&mdash;or
of anything save his inability to do as he had come to do&mdash;and
feeling angry as to that.</p>

<p>Yet in the blow&mdash;the accidental blow that had followed upon
her rising and attempting to come to him, had been some anger
against her for wanting to come near him at all. And that it was
perhaps&mdash; he was truly not sure, even now, that had given that
blow its so destructive force. It was so afterward, anyhow, that he
was compelled to think of it. And yet there was also the truth that
in rising he was seeking to save her&mdash;even in spite of his
hate. That he was also, for the moment at least, sorry for that
blow. Again, though, once the boat had upset and both were in the
water&mdash;in all that confusion, and when she was drowning, he
had been moved by the thought: "Do nothing." For thus he would be
rid of her. Yes, he had so thought. But again, there was the fact
that all through, as Mr. Belknap and Mr. Jephson had pointed out,
he had been swayed by his obsession for Miss X, the super
motivating force in connection with all of this. But now, did the
Reverend McMillan, considering all that went before and all that
came after&mdash;the fact that the unintentional blow still had had
anger in it&mdash;angry dissatisfaction with
her&mdash;really&mdash;and that afterwards he had not gone to her
rescue&mdash;as now&mdash;honestly and truly as he was trying to
show&mdash;did he think that that constituted murder&mdash;mortal
blood guilt for which spiritually, as well as legally, he might be
said to deserve death? Did he? He would like to know for his own
soul's peace&mdash;so that he could pray, maybe.</p>

<p>The Reverend McMillan hearing all this&mdash;and never in his
life before having heard or having had passed to him so intricate
and elusive and strange a problem&mdash;and because of Clyde's
faith in and regard for him, enormously impressed. And now sitting
before him quite still and pondering most deeply, sadly and even
nervously&mdash;so serious and important was this request for an
opinion&mdash;something which, as he knew, Clyde was counting on to
give him earthly and spiritual peace. But, none-the-less, the
Reverend McMillan was himself too puzzled to answer so quickly.</p>

<p>"Up to the time you went in that boat with her, Clyde, you had
not changed in your mood toward her&mdash;your intention
to&mdash;to&mdash;"</p>

<p>The Reverend McMillan's face was gray and drawn. His eyes were
sad. He had been listening, as he now felt, to a sad and terrible
story&mdash;an evil and cruel self-torturing and destroying story.
This young boy&mdash;really&mdash;! His hot, restless heart which
plainly for the lack of so many things which he, the Reverend
McMillan, had never wanted for, had rebelled. And because of that
rebellion had sinned mortally and was condemned to die. Indeed his
reason was as intensely troubled as his heart was moved.</p>

<p>"No, I had not."</p>

<p>"You were, as you say, angry with yourself for being so weak as
not to be able to do what you had planned to do."</p>

<p>"In a way it was like that, yes. But then I was sorry, too, you
see. And maybe afraid. I'm not exactly sure now. Maybe not,
either."</p>

<p>The Reverend McMillan shook his head. So strange! So evasive! So
evil! And yet&mdash;</p>

<p>"But at the same time, as you say, you were angry with her for
having driven you to that point."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Where you were compelled to wrestle with so terrible a
problem?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Tst! Tst! Tst! And so you thought of striking her."</p>

<p>"Yes, I did."</p>

<p>"But you could not."</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Praised be the mercy of God. Yet in the blow that you did
strike&mdash; unintentionally&mdash;as you say&mdash;there was
still some anger against her. That was why the blow was so&mdash;so
severe. You did not want her to come near you."</p>

<p>"No, I didn't. I think I didn't, anyhow. I'm not quite sure. It
may be that I wasn't quite right. Anyhow&mdash;all worked up, I
guess&mdash; sick almost. I&mdash;I&mdash;" In his
uniform&mdash;his hair cropped so close, Clyde sat there, trying
honestly now to think how it really was (exactly) and greatly
troubled by his inability to demonstrate to himself
even&mdash;either his guilt or his lack of guilt. Was he&mdash;or
was he not? And the Reverend McMillan&mdash;himself intensely
strained, muttering: "Wide is the gate and broad the way that
leadeth to destruction." And yet finally adding: "But you did rise
to save her."</p>

<p>"Yes, afterwards, I got up. I meant to catch her after she fell
back. That was what upset the boat."</p>

<p>"And you did really want to catch her?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. At the moment I guess I did. Anyhow I felt sorry,
I think."</p>

<p>"But can you say now truly and positively, as your Creator sees
you, that you were sorry&mdash;or that you wanted to save her
then?"</p>

<p>"It all happened so quick, you see," began Clyde
nervously&mdash; hopelessly, almost, "that I'm not just sure. No, I
don't know that I was so very sorry. No. I really don't know, you
see, now. Sometimes I think maybe I was, a little, sometimes not,
maybe. But after she was gone and I was on shore, I felt
sorry&mdash;a little. But I was sort of glad, too, you know, to be
free, and yet frightened, too&mdash;You see&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know. You were going to that Miss X. But out there, when
she was in the water&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"You did not want to go to her rescue?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Tst! Tst! Tst! You felt no sorrow? No shame? Then?"</p>

<p>"Yes, shame, maybe. Maybe sorrow, too, a little. I knew it was
terrible. I felt that it was, of course. But still&mdash;you
see&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know. That Miss X. You wanted to get away."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;but mostly I was frightened, and I didn't want to
help her."</p>

<p>"Yes! Yes! Tst! Tst! Tst! If she drowned you could go to that
Miss X. You thought of that?" The Reverend McMillan's lips were
tightly and sadly compressed.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"My son! My son! In your heart was murder then."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," Clyde said reflectively. "I have thought since it
must have been that way."</p>

<p>The Reverend McMillan paused and to hearten himself for this
task began to pray&mdash;but silently&mdash;and to himself: "Our
Father who art in Heaven&mdash;hallowed be Thy name. Thy Kingdom
come, Thy will be done&mdash;on earth as it is in Heaven." He
stirred again after a time.</p>

<p>"Ah, Clyde. The mercy of God is equal to every sin. I know it.
He sent His own son to die for the evil of the world. It must be
so&mdash;if you will but repent. But that thought! That deed! You
have much to pray for, my son&mdash;much. Oh, yes. For in the sight
of God, I fear,&mdash;yes&mdash;And yet&mdash;I must pray for
enlightenment. This is a strange and terrible story. There are so
many phases. It may be but pray. Pray with me now that you and I
may have light." He bowed his head. He sat for minutes in
silence&mdash;while Clyde, also, in silence and troubled doubt, sat
before him. Then, after a time he began:</p>

<p>"Oh, Lord, rebuke me not in thine anger; neither chasten me in
Thy hot displeasure. Have mercy on me, O Lord, for I am weak. Heal
me in my shame and sorrow for my soul is wounded and dark in Thy
sight. Oh, let the wickedness of my heart pass. Lead me, O God,
into Thy righteousness. Let the wickedness of my heart pass and
remember it not."</p>

<p>Clyde&mdash;his head down&mdash;sat still&mdash;very still. He,
himself, was at last shaken and mournful. No doubt his sin was very
great. Very, very terrible! And yet&mdash;But then, the Reverend
McMillan ceasing and rising, he, too, rose, the while McMillan
added: "But I must go now. I must think&mdash;pray. This has
troubled and touched me deeply. Oh, very, Lord. And you&mdash;my
son&mdash;you return and pray&mdash; alone. Repent. Ask of God on
your knees His forgiveness and He will hear you. Yes, He will. And
to-morrow&mdash;or as soon as I honestly can&mdash;I will come
again. But do not despair. Pray always&mdash; for in prayer alone,
prayer and contrition, is salvation. Rest in the strength of Him
who holds the world in the hollow of His hand. In His abounding
strength and mercy, is peace and forgiveness. Oh, yes."</p>

<p>He struck the iron door with a small key ring that he carried
and at once the guard, hearing it, returned.</p>

<p>Then having escorted Clyde to his cell and seen him once more
shut within that restraining cage, he took his own departure,
heavily and miserably burdened with all that he had heard. And
Clyde was left to brood on all he had said&mdash;and how it had
affected McMillan, as well as himself. His new friend's stricken
mood. The obvious pain and horror with which he viewed it all. Was
he really and truly guilty? Did he really and truly deserve to die
for this? Was that what the Reverend McMillan would decide? And in
the face of all his tenderness and mercy?</p>

<p>And another week in which, moved by Clyde's seeming contrition,
and all the confusing and extenuating circumstances of his story,
and having wrestled most earnestly with every moral aspect of it,
the Reverend McMillan once more before his cell door&mdash;but only
to say that however liberal or charitable his interpretation of the
facts, as at last Clyde had truthfully pictured them, still he
could not feel that either primarily or secondarily could he be
absolved from guilt for her death. He had plotted&mdash;had he not?
He had not gone to her rescue when he might have. He had wished her
dead and afterwards had not been sorry. In the blow that had
brought about the upsetting of the boat had been some anger. Also
in the mood that had not permitted him to strike. The facts that he
had been influenced by the beauty and position of Miss X to the
plotting of this deed, and, after his evil relations with Roberta,
that she had been determined he should marry her, far from being
points in extenuation of his actions, were really further evidence
of his general earthly sin and guilt. Before the Lord then he had
sinned in many ways. In those dark days, alas, as Mr. McMillan saw
it, he was little more than a compound of selfishness and
unhallowed desire and fornication against the evil of which Paul
had thundered. It had endured to the end and had not
changed&mdash;until he had been taken by the law. He had not
repented&mdash;not even there at Bear Lake where he had time for
thought. And besides, had he not, from the beginning to end,
bolstered it with false and evil pretenses? Verily.</p>

<p>On the other hand, no doubt if he were sent to the chair now in
the face of his first&mdash;and yet so clear manifestation of
contrition&mdash; when now, for the first time he was beginning to
grasp the enormity of his offense&mdash;it would be but to compound
crime with crime&mdash;the state in this instance being the
aggressor. For, like the warden and many others, McMillan was
against capital punishment&mdash; preferring to compel the
wrong-doer to serve the state in some way. But, none-the-less, he
felt himself compelled to acknowledge, Clyde was far from innocent.
Think as he would&mdash;and however much spiritually he desired to
absolve him, was he not actually guilty?</p>

<p>In vain it was that McMillan now pointed out to Clyde that his
awakened moral and spiritual understanding more perfectly and
beautifully fitted him for life and action than ever before. He was
alone. He had no one who believed in him. <i>No one</i>. He had no
one, whom, in any of his troubled and tortured actions before that
crime saw anything but the darkest guilt apparently. And
yet&mdash;and yet&mdash;(and this despite Sondra and the Reverend
McMillan and all the world for that matter, Mason, the jury at
Bridgeburg, the Court of Appeals at Albany, if it should decide to
confirm the jury at Bridgeburg), he had a feeling in his heart that
he was not as guilty as they all seemed to think. After all they
had not been tortured as he had by Roberta with her determination
that he marry her and thus ruin his whole life. They had not burned
with that unquenchable passion for the Sondra of his beautiful
dream as he had. They had not been harassed, tortured, mocked by
the ill-fate of his early life and training, forced to sing and
pray on the streets as he had in such a degrading way, when his
whole heart and soul cried out for better things. How could they
judge him, these people, all or any one of them, even his own
mother, when they did not know what his own mental, physical and
spiritual suffering had been? And as he lived through it again in
his thoughts at this moment the sting and mental poison of it was
as real to him as ever. Even in the face of all the facts and as
much as every one felt him to be guilty, there was something so
deep within him that seemed to cry out against it that, even now,
at times, it startled him. Still&mdash;there was the Reverend
McMillan&mdash;he was a very fair and just and merciful man. Surely
he saw all this from a higher light and better viewpoint than his
own. While at times he felt strongly that he was innocent, at
others he felt that he must be guilty.</p>

<p>Oh, these evasive and tangled and torturesome thoughts!! Would
he never be able&mdash;quite&mdash;to get the whole thing
straightened out in his own mind?</p>

<p>So Clyde not being able to take advantage truly of either the
tenderness and faith and devotion of so good and pure a soul as the
Reverend McMillan or the all merciful and all powerful God of whom
here he stood as the ambassador. What was he to do, really? How
pray, resignedly, unreservedly, faithfully? And in that
mood&mdash;and because of the urge of the Reverend Duncan, who was
convinced by Clyde's confession that he must have been completely
infused with the spirit of God, once more thumbing through the
various passages and chapters pointed out to him&mdash;reading and
re-reading the Psalms most familiar to him, seeking from their
inspiration to catch the necessary contrition&mdash;which once
caught would give him that peace and strength which in those long
and dreary hours he so much desired. Yet never quite catching
it.</p>

<p>Parallel with all this, four more months passed. And at the end
of that time&mdash;in January, 19&mdash;, the Court of Appeals
finding (Fulham, Jr., reviewing the evidence as offered by Belknap
and Jephson)&mdash; with Kincaid, Briggs, Truman and Dobshutter
concurring, that Clyde was guilty as decided by the Cataraqui
County jury and sentencing him to die at some time within the week
beginning February 28th or six weeks later&mdash;and saying in
conclusion:</p>

<p>"We are mindful that this is a case of circumstantial evidence
and that the only eyewitness denies that death was the result of
crime. But in obedience to the most exacting requirements of that
manner of proof, the counsel for the people, with very unusual
thoroughness and ability has investigated and presented evidence of
a great number of circumstances for the purpose of truly solving
the question of the defendant's guilt or innocence.</p>

<p>"We might think that the proof of some of these facts standing
by themselves was subject to doubt by reason of unsatisfactory or
contradictory evidence, and that other occurrences might be so
explained or interpreted as to be reconcilable with innocence. The
defense&mdash;and very ably&mdash;sought to enforce this view.</p>

<p>"But taken all together and considered as a connected whole,
they make such convincing proof of guilt that we are not able to
escape from its force by any justifiable process of reasoning and
we are compelled to say that not only is the verdict not opposed to
the weight of evidence, and to the proper inference to be drawn
from it, but that it is abundantly justified thereby. Decision of
the lower court unanimously confirmed."</p>

<p>On hearing this, McMillan, who was in Syracuse at the time,
hurrying to Clyde in the hope that before the news was conveyed
officially, he should be there to encourage him spiritually, since,
only with the aid of the Lord, as he saw it&mdash;the eternal and
ever present help in trouble&mdash;would Clyde be able to endure so
heavy a blow. And finding him&mdash;for which he was most deeply
grateful&mdash; wholly unaware of what had occurred, since no news
of any kind was conveyed to any condemned man until the warrant for
his execution had arrived.</p>

<p>After a most tender and spiritual conversation&mdash;in which he
quoted from Matthew, Paul and John as to the unimportance of this
world&mdash; the true reality and joy of the next&mdash;Clyde was
compelled to learn from McMillan that the decision of the court had
gone against him. And that though McMillan talked of an appeal to
the Governor which he&mdash;and some others whom he was sure to be
able to influence would make&mdash;unless the Governor chose to
act, within six weeks, as Clyde knew, he would be compelled to die.
And then, once the force of that fact had finally burst on
him&mdash;and while McMillan talked on about faith and the refuge
which the mercy and wisdom of God provided&mdash;Clyde, standing
before him with more courage and character showing in his face and
eyes than at any time previously in his brief and eager career.</p>

<p>"So they decided against me. Now I will have to go through that
door after all,&mdash;like all those others. They'll draw the
curtains for me, too. Into that other room&mdash;then back across
the passage&mdash; saying good-bye as I go, like those others. I
will not be here any more." He seemed to be going over each step in
his mind&mdash;each step with which he was so familiar, only now,
for the first time, he was living it for himself. Now, in the face
of this dread news, which somehow was as fascinating as it was
terrible, feeling not as distrait or weak as at first he had
imagined he would be. Rather, to his astonishment, considering all
his previous terror in regard to this, thinking of what he would
do, what he would say, in an outwardly calm way.</p>

<p>Would he repeat prayers read to him by the Reverend McMillan
here? No doubt. And maybe gladly, too. And yet&mdash;</p>

<p>In his momentary trance he was unconscious of the fact that the
Reverend Duncan was whispering:</p>

<p>"But you see we haven't reached the end of this yet. There is a
new Governor coming into office in January. He is a very sensible
and kindly man, I hear. In fact I know several people who know
him&mdash;and it is my plan to see him personally&mdash;as well as
to have some other people whom I know write him on the strength of
what I will tell them."</p>

<p>But from Clyde's look at the moment, as well as what he now
said, he could tell that he was not listening.</p>

<p>"My mother. I suppose some one ought to telegraph her. She is
going to feel very bad." And then: "I don't suppose they believed
that those letters shouldn't have been introduced just as they
were, did they? I thought maybe they would." He was thinking of
Nicholson.</p>

<p>"Don't worry, Clyde," replied the tortured and saddened
McMillan, at this point more eager to take him in his arms and
comfort him than to say anything at all. "I have already
telegraphed your mother. As for that decision&mdash;I will see your
lawyers right away. Besides&mdash;as I say&mdash;I propose to see
the Governor myself. He is a new man, you see."</p>

<p>Once more he was now repeating all that Clyde had not heard
before.</p>

<h3>Chapter 34</h3>

<p>The scene was the executive chamber of the newly elected
Governor of the State of New York some three weeks after the news
conveyed to Clyde by McMillan. After many preliminary and futile
efforts on the part of Belknap and Jephson to obtain a commutation
of the sentence of Clyde from death to life imprisonment (the
customary filing of a plea for clemency, together with such
comments as they had to make in regard to the way the evidence had
been misinterpreted and the illegality of introducing the letters
of Roberta in their original form, to all of which Governor
Waltham, an ex-district attorney and judge from the southern part
of the state, had been conscientiously compelled to reply that he
could see no reason for interfering) there was now before Governor
Waltham Mrs. Griffiths together with the Reverend McMillan. For,
moved by the widespread interest in the final disposition of
Clyde's case, as well as the fact that his mother, because of her
unshaken devotion to him, and having learned of the decision of the
Court of Appeals, had once more returned to Auburn and since then
had been appealing to the newspapers, as well as to himself through
letters for a correct understanding of the extenuating
circumstances surrounding her son's downfall, and because she
herself had repeatedly appealed to him for a personal interview in
which she should be allowed to present her deepest convictions in
regard to all this, the Governor had at last consented to see her.
It could do no harm. Besides it would tend to soothe her. Also
variable public sentiment, whatever its convictions in any given
case, was usually on the side of the form or gesture of
clemency&mdash;without, however, any violence to its convictions.
And, in this case, if one could judge by the newspapers, the public
was convinced that Clyde was guilty. On the other hand, Mrs.
Griffiths, owing to her own long meditations in regard to Clyde,
Roberta, his sufferings during and since the trial, the fact that
according to the Reverend McMillan he had at last been won to a
deep contrition and a spiritual union with his Creator whatever his
original sin, was now more than ever convinced that humanity and
even justice demanded that at least he be allowed to live. And so
standing before the Governor, a tall, sober and somewhat somber man
who, never in all his life had even so much as sensed the fevers or
fires that Clyde had known, yet who, being a decidedly affectionate
father and husband, could very well sense what Mrs. Griffiths'
present emotions must be. Yet greatly exercised by the compulsion
which the facts, as he understood them, as well as a deep-seated
and unchangeable submission to law and order, thrust upon him. Like
the pardon clerk before him, he had read all the evidence submitted
to the Court of Appeals, as well as the latest briefs submitted by
Belknap and Jephson. But on what grounds could he&mdash;David
Waltham, and without any new or varying data of any kind&mdash;just
a reinterpretation of the evidence as already passed
upon&mdash;venture to change Clyde's death sentence to life
imprisonment? Had not a jury, as well as the Court of Appeals,
already said he should die?</p>

<p>In consequence, as Mrs. Griffiths began her plea, her voice
shaky&mdash; retracing as best she could the story of Clyde's life,
his virtues, the fact that at no time ever had he been a bad or
cruel boy&mdash;that Roberta, if not Miss X, was not entirely
guiltless in the matter&mdash; he merely gazed at her deeply moved.
The love and devotion of such a mother! Her agony in this hour; her
faith that her son could not be as evil as the proven facts seemed
to indicate to him and every one else. "Oh, my dear Governor, how
can the sacrifice of my son's life now, and when spiritually he has
purged his soul of sin and is ready to devote himself to the work
of God, repay the state for the loss of that poor, dear girl's
life, whether it was accidentally or otherwise taken&mdash;how can
it? Can not the millions of people of the state of New York be
merciful? Cannot you as their representative exercise the mercy
that they may feel?"</p>

<p>Her voice broke&mdash;she could not go on. Instead she turned
her back and began to cry silently, while Waltham, shaken by an
emotion he could not master, merely stood there. This poor woman!
So obviously honest and sincere. Then the Reverend McMillan, seeing
his opportunity, now entering his plea. Clyde had changed. He could
not speak as to his life before&mdash;but since his
incarceration&mdash; or for the last year, at least, he had come
into a new understanding of life, duty, his obligations to man and
God. If but the death sentence could be commuted to life
imprisonment&mdash;</p>

<p>And the Governor, who was a very earnest and conscientious man,
listened with all attention to McMillan, whom, as he saw and
concluded was decidedly an intense and vital and highly idealistic
person. No question in his own mind but what the words of this
man&mdash;whatever they were, would be true&mdash;in so far as his
own understanding would permit the conception of a truth.</p>

<p>"But you, personally, Mr. McMillan," the Governor at last found
voice to say, "because of your long contact with him in the prison
there&mdash;do you know of any material fact not introduced at the
trial which would in any way tend to invalidate or weaken any phase
of the testimony offered at the trial? As you must know this is a
legal proceeding. I cannot act upon sentiment alone&mdash;and
especially in the face of the unanimous decision of two separate
courts."</p>

<p>He looked directly at McMillan, who, pale and dumb, now gazed at
him in return. For now upon his word&mdash;upon his shoulders
apparently was being placed the burden of deciding as to Clyde's
guilt or innocence. But could he do that? Had he not decided, after
due meditation as to Clyde's confessions, that he was guilty before
God and the law? And could he now&mdash;for mercy's sake&mdash;and
in the face of his deepest spiritual conviction, alter his report
of his conviction? Would that be true&mdash;white, valuable before
the Lord? And as instantly deciding that he, Clyde's spiritual
adviser, must not in any way be invalidated in his spiritual worth
to Clyde. "Ye are the salt of the earth; but if the salt have lost
his savor, wherewith shall it be salted?" And forthwith he
declared: "As his spiritual advisor I have entered only upon the
spiritual, not the legal aspect of his life." And thereupon Waltham
at once deciding, from something in McMillan's manner that he, like
all others, apparently, was satisfied as to Clyde's guilt. And so,
finally finding courage to say to Mrs. Griffiths: "Unless some
definite evidence such as I have not yet seen and which will affect
the legality of these two findings can be brought me, I have no
alternative, Mrs. Griffiths, but to allow the verdict as written to
stand. I am very sorry&mdash;oh, more than I can tell you. But if
the law is to be respected its decisions can never be altered
except for reasons that in themselves are full of legal merit. I
wish I could decide differently. I do indeed. My heart and my
prayers go with you."</p>

<p>He pressed a button. His secretary entered. It was plain that
the interview was ended. Mrs. Griffiths, violently shaken and
deeply depressed by the peculiar silence and evasion of McMillan at
the crucial moment of this interview when the Governor had asked
such an all important and direct question as to the guilt of her
son, was still unable to say a word more. But now what? Which way?
To whom to turn? God, and God only. She and Clyde must find in
their Creator the solace for his failure and death in this world.
And as she was thinking and still weeping, the Reverend McMillan
approached and gently led her from the room.</p>

<p>When she was gone the Governor finally turned to his
secretary:</p>

<p>"Never in my life have I faced a sadder duty. It will always be
with me." He turned and gazed out upon a snowy February
landscape.</p>

<p>And after this but two more weeks of life for Clyde, during
which time, and because of his ultimate decision conveyed to him
first by McMillan, but in company with his mother, from whose face
Clyde could read all, even before McMillan spoke, and from whom he
heard all once more as to his need of refuge and peace in God, his
Savior, he now walked up and down his cell, unable to rest for any
length of time anywhere. For, because of this final completely
convincing sensation, that very soon he was to die, he felt the
need, even now of retracing his unhappy life. His youth. Kansas
City. Chicago. Lycurgus. Roberta and Sondra. How swiftly they and
all that was connected with them passed in review. The few, brief,
bright intense moments. His desire for more&mdash;more&mdash;that
intense desire he had felt there in Lycurgus after Sondra came and
now this, this! And now even this was
ending&mdash;this&mdash;this&mdash;Why, he had scarcely lived at
all as yet&mdash;and these last two years so miserably between
these crushing walls. And of this life but fourteen, thirteen,
twelve, eleven, ten, nine, eight of the filtering and now feverish
days left. They were going&mdash;going. But
life&mdash;life&mdash;how was one to do without that&mdash;the
beauty of the days&mdash; of the sun and rain&mdash;of work love,
energy, desire. Oh, he really did not want to die. He did not. Why
say to him so constantly as his mother and the Reverend McMillan
now did to resolve all his care in divine mercy and think only of
God, when now, now, was all? And yet the Reverend McMillan
insisting that only in Christ and the hereafter was real peace. Oh,
yes&mdash;but just the same, before the Governor might he not have
said&mdash;might he not have said that he was not guilty&mdash;or
at least not entirely guilty&mdash;if only he had seen it that
way&mdash;that time&mdash;and then&mdash;then&mdash;why then the
Governor might have commuted his sentence to life
imprisonment&mdash;might he not? For he had asked his mother what
the Reverend McMillan had said to the Governor&mdash;(yet without
saying to her that he had ever confessed all to him), and she had
replied that he had told him how sincerely he had humbled himself
before the Lord&mdash;but not that he was not guilty. And Clyde,
feeling how strange it was that the Reverend McMillan could not
conscientiously bring himself to do more than that for him. How
sad. How hopeless. Would no one ever understand&mdash;or give him
credit for his human&mdash;if all too human and perhaps wrong
hungers&mdash;yet from which so many others&mdash;along with
himself suffered?</p>

<p>But worse yet, if anything, Mrs. Griffiths, because of what the
Reverend McMillan had said&mdash;or failed to say, in answer to the
final question asked by Governor Waltham&mdash;and although
subsequently in answer to an inquiry of her own, he had repeated
the statement, she was staggered by the thought that perhaps, after
all, Clyde was as guilty as at first she had feared. And because of
that asking at one point:</p>

<p>"Clyde, if there is anything you have not confessed, you must
confess it before you go."</p>

<p>"I have confessed everything to God and to Mr. McMillan, Mother.
Isn't that enough?"</p>

<p>"No, Clyde. You have told the world that you are innocent. But
if you are not you must say so."</p>

<p>"But if my conscience tells me that I am right, is not that
enough?"</p>

<p>"No, not if God's word says differently, Clyde," replied Mrs.
Griffiths nervously&mdash;and with great inward spiritual torture.
But he chose to say nothing further at that time. How could he
discuss with his mother or the world the strange shadings which in
his confession and subsequent talks with the Reverend McMillan he
had not been able to solve. It was not to be done.</p>

<p>And because of that refusal on her son's part to confide in her,
Mrs. Griffiths, tortured, not only spiritually but personally. Her
own son&mdash;and so near death and not willing to say what already
apparently he had said to Mr. McMillan. Would not God ever be done
with this testing her? And yet on account of what McMillan had
already said,&mdash;that he considered Clyde, whatever his past
sins, contrite and clean before the Lord&mdash;a youth truly ready
to meet his Maker&mdash;she was prone to rest. The Lord was great!
He was merciful. In His bosom was peace. What was death&mdash;what
life&mdash;to one whose heart and mind were at peace with Him? It
was nothing. A few years (how very few) and she and Asa and after
them, his brothers and sisters, would come to join him&mdash;and
all his miseries here would be forgotten. But without peace in the
Lord&mdash;the full and beautiful realization of His presence,
love, care and mercy...! She was tremulous at moments now in her
spiritual exaltation&mdash;no longer quite normal&mdash;as Clyde
could see and feel. But also by her prayers and anxiety as to his
spiritual welfare, he was also able to see how little, really, she
had ever understood of his true moods and aspirations. He had
longed for so much there in Kansas City and he had had so little.
Things&mdash;just things&mdash;had seemed very important to
him&mdash;and he had so resented being taken out on the street as
he had been, before all the other boys and girls, many of whom had
all the things that he so craved, and when he would have been glad
to have been anywhere else in the world than out there&mdash;on the
street! That mission life that to his mother was so wonderful, yet,
to him, so dreary! But was it wrong for him to feel so? Had it
been? Would the Lord resent it now? And, maybe, she was right as to
her thoughts about him. Unquestionably he would have been better
off if he had followed her advice. But how strange it was, that to
his own mother, and even now in these closing hours, when above all
things he craved sympathy&mdash;but more than sympathy, true and
deep understanding&mdash;even now&mdash;and as much as she loved
and sympathized with, and was seeking to aid him with all her
strength in her stern and self-sacrificing way,&mdash;still he
could not turn to her now and tell her, his own mother, just how it
all happened. It was as though there was an unsurmountable wall or
impenetrable barrier between them, built by the lack of
understanding&mdash;for it was just that. She would never
understand his craving for ease and luxury, for beauty, for
love&mdash;his particular kind of love that went with show,
pleasure, wealth, position, his eager and immutable aspirations and
desires. She could not understand these things. She would look on
all of it as sin&mdash;evil, selfishness. And in connection with
all the fatal steps involving Roberta and Sondra, as
adultery&mdash;unchastity&mdash;murder, even. And she would and did
expect him to be terribly sorry and wholly repentant, when, even
now, and for all he had said to the Reverend McMillan and to her,
he could not feel so&mdash;not wholly so&mdash;although great was
his desire now to take refuge in God, but better yet, if it were
only possible, in her own understanding and sympathetic heart. If
it were only possible.</p>

<p>Lord, it was all so terrible! He was so alone, even in these
last few and elusive hours (the swift passing of the days), with
his mother and also the Reverend McMillan here with him, but
neither understanding.</p>

<p>But, apart from all this and much worse, he was locked up here
and they would not let him go. There was a system&mdash;a horrible
routine system&mdash;as long since he had come to feel it to be so.
It was iron. It moved automatically like a machine without the aid
or the hearts of men. These guards! They with their letters, their
inquiries, their pleasant and yet really hollow words, their trips
to do little favors, or to take the men in and out of the yard or
to their baths&mdash;they were iron, too&mdash;mere machines,
automatons, pushing and pushing and yet restraining and restraining
one&mdash;within these walls, as ready to kill as to favor in case
of opposition&mdash; but pushing, pushing, pushing&mdash;always
toward that little door over there, from which there was no
escape&mdash;no escape&mdash;just on and on&mdash; until at last
they would push him through it never to return! <i>Never to
return</i>!</p>

<p>Each time he thought of this he arose and walked the floor.
Afterwards, usually, he resumed the puzzle of his own guilt. He
tried to think of Roberta and the evil he had done her, to read the
Bible&mdash;even&mdash;lying on his face on the iron
cot&mdash;repeating over and over: "Lord, give me peace. Lord, give
me light. Lord, give me strength to resist any evil thoughts that I
should not have. I know I am not wholly white. Oh, no. I know I
plotted evil. Yes, yes, I know that. I confess. But must I really
die now? Is there no help? Will you not help me, Lord? Will you not
manifest yourself, as my mother says you will&mdash;for me? Will
you get the Governor to change my sentence before the final moment
to life imprisonment? Will you get the Reverend McMillan to change
his views and go to him, and my mother, too? I will drive out all
sinful thoughts. I will be different. Oh, yes, I will, if you will
only spare me. Do not let me die now&mdash;so soon. Do not. I will
pray. Yes, I will. Give me the strength to understand and
believe&mdash;and pray. Oh, do!"</p>

<p>It was like this in those short, horrible days between the
return of his mother and the Reverend McMillan from their final
visit to the Governor and in his last hour that Clyde thought and
prayed&mdash; yet finally in a kind of psychic terror, evoked by
his uncertainty as to the meaning of the hereafter, his certainty
of death, and the faith and emotions of his mother, as well as
those of the Reverend McMillan, who was about every day with his
interpretations of divine mercy and his exhortations as to the
necessity of complete faith and reliance upon it, he, himself
coming at last to believe, not only must he have faith but that he
had it&mdash;and peace&mdash;complete and secure. In that state,
and at the request of the Reverend McMillan, and his mother,
finally composing, with the personal aid and supervision of
McMillan, who changed some of the sentences in his presence and
with his consent, an address to the world, and more particularly to
young men of his own years, which read:</p>

<blockquote>In the shadow of the Valley of Death it is my desire to
do everything that would remove any doubt as to my having found
Jesus Christ, the personal Savior and unfailing friend. My one
regret at this time is that I have not given Him the preeminence in
my life while I had the opportunity to work for Him.<br>
<br>
If I could only say some one thing that would draw young men to Him
I would deem it the greatest privilege ever granted me. But all I
can now say is, "I know in whom I have believed, and am persuaded
that He is able to keep that which I have committed unto Him
against that day" [a quotation that McMillan had familiarized him
with].<br>
<br>
If the young men of this country could only know the joy and
pleasure of a Christian life, I know they would do all in their
power to become earnest, active Christians, and would strive to
live as Christ would have them live.<br>
<br>
There is not one thing I have left undone which will bar me from
facing my God, knowing that my sins are forgiven, for I have been
free and frank in my talks with my spiritual adviser, and God knows
where I stand.<br>
<br>
My task is done, the victory won.<br>
<br>
CLYDE GRIFFITHS.</blockquote>

<p>Having written this&mdash;a statement so unlike all the previous
rebellious moods that had characterized him that even now he was,
not a little impressed by the difference, handing it to McMillan,
who, heartened by this triumph, exclaimed: "And the victory
<i>is</i> won, Clyde. 'This day shalt thou be with me in Paradise.'
You have His word. Your soul and your body belong to Him. Praised,
everlastingly, be His name."</p>

<p>And then so wrought up was he by this triumph, taking both
Clyde's hands in his and kissing them and then folding him in his
arms: "My son, my son, in whom I am well pleased. In you God has
truly manifested His truth. His power to save. I see it. I feel it.
Your address to the world is really His own voice to the world."
And then pocketing the note with the understanding that it was to
be issued after Clyde's death&mdash;not before. And yet Clyde
having written this, still dubious at moments. Was he truly saved?
The time was so short? Could he rely on God with that absolute
security which he had just announced now characterized him? Could
he? Life was so strange. The future so obscure. Was there really a
life after death&mdash;a God by whom he would be welcomed as the
Reverend McMillan and his own mother insisted? Was there?</p>

<p>In the midst of this, two days before his death and in a final
burst of panic, Mrs. Griffiths wiring the Hon. David Waltham: "Can
you say before your God that you have no doubt of Clyde's guilt?
Please wire. If you cannot, then his blood will be upon your head.
His mother." And Robert Fessler, the secretary to the Governor
replying by wire: "Governor Waltham does not think himself
justified in interfering with the decision of the Court of
Appeals."</p>

<p>At last the final day&mdash;the final hour&mdash;Clyde's
transfer to a cell in the old death house, where, after a shave and
a bath, he was furnished with black trousers, a white shirt without
a collar, to be opened at the neck afterwards, new felt slippers
and gray socks. So accoutered, he was allowed once more to meet his
mother and McMillan, who, from six o'clock in the evening preceding
the morning of his death until four of the final morning, were
permitted to remain near him to counsel with him as to the love and
mercy of God. And then at four the warden appearing to say that it
was time, he feared, that Mrs. Griffiths depart leaving Clyde in
the care of Mr. McMillan. (The sad compulsion of the law, as he
explained.) And then Clyde's final farewell to his mother, before
which, and in between the silences and painful twistings of heart
strings, he had managed to say:</p>

<p>"Mama, you must believe that I die resigned and content. It
won't be hard. God has heard my prayers. He has given me strength
and peace." But to himself adding: "Had he?"</p>

<p>And Mrs. Griffiths exclaiming: "My son! My son, I know, I know.
I have faith too. I know that my Redeemer liveth and that He is
yours. Though we die&mdash;yet shall we live!" She was looking
heavenward, and seemed transfixed. Yet as suddenly turning to Clyde
and gathering him in her arms and holding him long and firmly to
her, whispering: "My son&mdash;my baby&mdash;" And her voice broke
and trailed off into breathlessness&mdash;and her strength seemed
to be going all to him, until she felt she must leave or
fall&mdash;And so she turned quickly and unsteadily to the warden,
who was waiting for her to lead her to Auburn friends of
McMillan's.</p>

<p>And then in the dark of this midwinter morning&mdash;the final
moment&mdash; with the guards coming, first to slit his right
trouser leg for the metal plate and then going to draw the curtains
before the cells: "It is time, I fear. Courage, my son." It was the
Reverend McMillan&mdash;now accompanied by the Reverend Gibson,
who, seeing the prison guards approaching, was then addressing
Clyde.</p>

<p>And Clyde now getting up from his cot, on which, beside the
Reverend McMillan, he had been listening to the reading of John,
14, 15, 16: "Let not your heart be troubled. Ye believe in
God&mdash; believe also in me." And then the final walk with the
Reverend McMillan on his right hand and the Reverend Gibson on his
left&mdash;the guards front and rear. But with, instead of the
customary prayers, the Reverend McMillan announcing: "Humble
yourselves under the mighty hand of God that He may exalt you in
due time. Cast all your care upon Him for He careth for you. Be at
peace. Wise and righteous are His ways, who hath called us into His
eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after that we have suffered a
little. I am the way, the truth and the life&mdash;no man cometh
unto the Father but by me."</p>

<p>But various voices&mdash;as Clyde entered the first door to
cross to the chair room, calling: "Good-by, Clyde." And Clyde, with
enough earthly thought and strength to reply: "Good-by, all." But
his voice sounding so strange and weak, even to himself, so far
distant as though it emanated from another being walking alongside
of him, and not from himself. And his feet were walking, but
automatically, it seemed. And he was conscious of that familiar
shuffle&mdash;shuffle&mdash; as they pushed him on and on toward
that door. Now it was here; now it was being opened. There it
was&mdash;at last&mdash;the chair he had so often seen in his
dreams&mdash;that he so dreaded&mdash;to which he was now compelled
to go. He was being pushed toward that&mdash;into
that&mdash;on&mdash; on&mdash;through the door which was now
open&mdash;to receive him&mdash;but which was as quickly closed
again on all the earthly life he had ever known.<br>
<br></p>

<p>It was the Reverend McMillan, who, gray and weary&mdash;a
quarter of an hour later, walked desolately&mdash;and even a little
uncertainly&mdash;as one who is physically very weak&mdash;through
the cold doors of the prison. It was so faint&mdash;so
weak&mdash;so gray as yet&mdash;this late winter day&mdash;and so
like himself now. Dead! He, Clyde, had walked so nervously and yet
somehow trustingly beside him but a few minutes before&mdash;and
now he was dead. The law! Prisons such as this. Strong, evil men
who scoffed betimes where Clyde had prayed. That confession! Had he
decided truly&mdash;with the wisdom of God, as God gave him to see
wisdom? Had he? Clyde's eyes! He, himself&mdash;the Reverend
McMillan had all but fainted beside him as that cap was adjusted to
his head&mdash;that current turned on&mdash;and he had had to be
assisted, sick and trembling, from the room&mdash;he upon whom
Clyde had relied. And he had asked God for strength,&mdash;was
asking it.</p>

<p>He walked along the silent street&mdash;only to be compelled to
pause and lean against a tree&mdash;leafless in the winter&mdash;so
bare and bleak. Clyde's eyes! That look as he sank limply into that
terrible chair, his eyes fixed nervously and, as he thought,
appealingly and dazedly upon him and the group surrounding him.</p>

<p>Had he done right? Had his decision before Governor Waltham been
truly sound, fair or merciful? Should he have said to
him&mdash;that perhaps&mdash;perhaps&mdash;there had been those
other influences playing upon him?...Was he never to have mental
peace again, perhaps?</p>

<p>"I know my Redeemer liveth and that He will keep him against
that day."</p>

<p>And then he walked and walked hours before he could present
himself to Clyde's mother, who, on her knees in the home of the
Rev. and Mrs. Francis Gault, Salvationists of Auburn, had been,
since four-thirty, praying for the soul of her son whom she still
tried to visualize as in the arms of his Maker.</p>

<p>"I know in whom I have believed," was a part of her prayer.<br>
<br></p>

<p><i>Souvenir</i>
</p>

<p>Dusk, of a summer night.</p>

<p>And the tall walls of the commercial heart of the city of San
Francisco&mdash;tall and gray in the evening shade.</p>

<p>And up a broad street from the south of Market&mdash;now
comparatively hushed after the din of the day, a little band of
five&mdash;a man of about sixty, short, stout, yet cadaverous as to
the flesh of his face&mdash;and more especially about the pale, dim
eyes&mdash;and with bushy white hair protruding from under a worn,
round felt hat&mdash;a most unimportant and exhausted looking
person, who carried a small, portable organ such as is customarily
used by street preachers and singers. And by his side, a woman not
more than five years his junior&mdash;taller, not so broad, but
solid of frame and vigorous&mdash;with snow white hair and wearing
an unrelieved costume of black&mdash;dress, bonnet, shoes. And her
face broader and more characterful than her husband's, but more
definitely seamed with lines of misery and suffering. At her side,
again, carrying a Bible and several hymn books&mdash;a boy of not
more than seven or eight&mdash;very round-eyed and alert, who,
because of some sympathetic understanding between him and his
elderly companion, seemed to desire to walk close to her&mdash;a
brisk and smart stepping&mdash;although none-too-well dressed boy.
With these three, again, but walking independently behind, a faded
and unattractive woman of twenty-seven or eight and another woman
of about fifty&mdash;apparently, because of their close
resemblance, mother and daughter.</p>

<p>It was hot, with the sweet languor of a Pacific summer about it
all. At Market, the great thoroughfare which they had
reached&mdash;and because of threading throngs of automobiles and
various lines of cars passing in opposite directions, they awaited
the signal of the traffic officer.</p>

<p>"Russell, stay close now." It was the wife speaking. "Better
take hold of my hand."</p>

<p>"It seems to me," commented the husband, very feeble and yet
serene, "that the traffic here grows worse all the time."</p>

<p>The cars clanged their bells. The automobiles barked and
snorted. But the little group seemed entirely unconscious of
anything save a set purpose to make its way across the street.</p>

<p>"Street preachers," observed a passing bank clerk to his cashier
girl friend.</p>

<p>"Sure&mdash;I see them up here nearly every Wednesday."</p>

<p>"Gee, it's pretty tough on the little kid, I should think. He's
pretty small to be dragged around on the streets, don't you think,
Ella?"</p>

<p>"Well, I'll say so. I'd hate to see a brother of mine in on any
such game. What kind of a life is that for a kid anyhow?" commented
Ella as they passed on.</p>

<p>Having crossed the street and reached the first intersection
beyond, they paused and looked around as though they had reached
their destination&mdash;the man putting down his organ which he
proceeded to open&mdash;setting up, as he did so, a small but
adequate music rack. At the same time his wife, taking from her
grandson the several hymnals and the Bible he carried, gave the
Bible as well as a hymnal to her husband, put one on the organ and
gave one to each of the remaining group including one for herself.
The husband looked somewhat vacantly about him&mdash;yet,
none-the-less with a seeming wide-eyed assurance, and began
with:</p>

<p>"We will begin with 276 tonight. 'How firm a foundation.' All
right, Miss Schoof."</p>

<p>At this the younger of the two women&mdash;very parched and
spare&mdash; angular and homely&mdash;to whom life had denied quite
all&mdash;seated herself upon the yellow camp chair and after
arranging the stops and turning the leaves of the book, began
playing the chosen hymn, to the tune of which they all joined
in.</p>

<p>By this time various homeward bound individuals of diverse
occupations and interests noticing this small group so
advantageously disposed near the principal thoroughfare of the
city, hesitated a moment,&mdash;either to eye them askance or to
ascertain the character of their work. And as they sang, the
nondescript and indifferent street audience gazed, held by the
peculiarity of such an unimportant group publicly raising its voice
against the vast skepticism and apathy of life. That gray and
flabby and ineffectual old man, in his worn and baggy blue suit.
This robust and yet uncouth and weary and white-haired woman; this
fresh and unsoiled and unspoiled and uncomprehending boy. What was
he doing here? And again that neglected and thin spinster and her
equally thin and distrait looking mother. Of the group, the wife
stood out in the eyes of the passers-by as having the force and
determination which, however blind or erroneous, makes for
self-preservation, if not real success in life. She, more than any
of the others, stood up with an ignorant, yet somehow respectable
air of conviction. And as several of the many who chanced to pause,
watched her, her hymn-book dropped to her side, her glance directed
straight before her into space, each said on his way: "Well, here
is one, who, whatever her defects, probably does what she believes
as nearly as possible." A kind of hard, fighting faith in the
wisdom and mercy of the definite overruling and watchful and
merciful power which she proclaimed was written in her every
feature and gesture.</p>

<p>The song was followed with a long prayer and by the wife; then a
sermon by the husband, testimonies by the others&mdash;all that God
had done for them. Then the return march to the hall, the hymnals
having been gathered, the organ folded and lifted by a strap over
the husband's shoulder. And as they walked&mdash;it was the husband
that commented: "A fine night. It seemed to me they were a little
more attentive than usual."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," returned the younger woman that had played the organ.
"At least eleven took tracts. And one old gentleman asked me where
the mission was and when we held services."</p>

<p>"Praise the Lord," commented the man.</p>

<p>And then at last the mission itself&mdash;"The Star of Hope.
Bethel Independent Mission, Meetings every Wednesday and Saturday
night, 8 to 10. Sundays at 11, 3, 8. Everybody welcome." And under
this legend in each window&mdash;"God is Love." And below that
again in smaller type: "How long since you wrote to Mother."</p>

<p>"Kin' I have a dime, grandma? I wana' go up to the corner and
git an ice-cream cone." It was the boy asking.</p>

<p>"Yes, I guess so, Russell. But listen to me. You are to come
right back."</p>

<p>"Yes, I will, grandma, sure. You know me."</p>

<p>He took the dime that his Grandmother had extracted from a deep
pocket in her dress and ran with it to the ice-cream vendor.</p>

<p>Her darling boy. The light and color of her declining years. She
must be kind to him, more liberal with him, not restrain him too
much, as maybe, maybe, she had&mdash;She looked affectionately and
yet a little vacantly after him as he ran. "For <i>his</i>
sake."</p>

<p>The small company, minus Russell, entered the yellow,
unprepossessing door and disappeared.</p>
