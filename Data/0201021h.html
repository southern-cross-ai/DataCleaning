  <h2><a id="story1"
     name="story1">I.&mdash;THE RESURRECTION OF FATHER BROWN</a></h2>

<h3>(No record of prior magazine publication)</h3>

  <p class="first">THERE was a brief period during which Father Brown enjoyed,
  or rather did not enjoy, something like fame. He was a nine days' wonder in
  the newspapers; he was even a common topic of controversy in the weekly
  reviews; his exploits were narrated eagerly and inaccurately in any number of
  clubs and drawing-rooms, especially in America. Incongruous and indeed
  incredible as it may seem to any one who knew him, his adventures as a
  detective were even made the subject of short stories appearing in
  magazines.</p>

  <p>Strangely enough, this wandering limelight struck him in the most obscure,
  or at least the most remote, of his many places of residence. He had been
  sent out to officiate, as something between a missionary and a parish priest,
  in one of those sections of the northern coast of South America, where strips
  of country still cling insecurely to European powers, or are continually
  threatening to become independent republics, under the gigantic shadow of
  President Monroe. The population was red and brown with pink spots; that is,
  it was Spanish-American, and largely Spanish-American-Indian, but there was a
  considerable and increasing infiltration of Americans of the northern
  sort&mdash;Englishmen, Germans, and the rest. And the trouble seems to have
  begun when one of these visitors, very recently landed and very much annoyed
  at having lost one of his bags, approached the first building of which he
  came in sight&mdash;which happened to be the mission-house and chapel
  attached to it, in front of which ran a long veranda and a long row of
  stakes, up which were trained the black twisted vines, their square leaves
  red with autumn. Behind them, also in a row, a number of human beings sat
  almost as rigid as the stakes, and coloured in some fashion like the vines.
  For while their broad-brimmed hats were as black as their unblinking eyes,
  the complexions of many of them might have been made out of the dark red
  timber of those transatlantic forests. Many of them were smoking very long,
  thin black cigars; and in all that group the smoke was almost the only moving
  thing. The visitor would probably have described them as natives, though some
  of them were very proud of Spanish blood. But he was not one to draw any fine
  distinction between Spaniards and Red Indians, being rather disposed to
  dismiss people from the scene when once he had convicted them of being native
  to it.</p>

  <p>He was a newspaper man from Kansas City, a lean, light-haired man with
  what Meredith called an adventurous nose; one could almost fancy it found its
  way by feeling its way and moved like the proboscis of an ant-eater. His
  name was Snaith, and his parents, after some obscure meditation, had called
  him Saul, a fact which he had the good feeling to conceal as far as possible.
  Indeed, he had ultimately compromised by calling himself Paul, though by no
  means for the same reason that had affected the Apostle of the Gentiles. On
  the contrary, so far as he had any views on such things, the name of the
  persecutor would have been more appropriate; for he regarded organized
  religion with the conventional contempt which can be learnt more easily from
  Ingersoll than from Voltaire. And this was, as it happened, the not very
  important side of his character which he turned towards the mission-station
  and the groups in front of the veranda. Something in their shameless repose
  and indifference inflamed his own fury of efficiency; and, as he could get no
  particular answer to his first questions, he began to do all the talking
  himself.</p>

  <p>Standing out there in the strong sunshine, a spick-and-span figure in his
  Panama hat and neat clothes, his grip-sack held m a steely grip, he began to
  shout at the people in the shadow. He began to explain to them very loudly
  why they were lazy and filthy, and bestially ignorant and lower than the
  beasts that perish, in case this problem should have previously exercised
  their minds. In his opinion it was the deleterious influence of priests that
  had made them so miserably poor and so hopelessly oppressed that they were
  able to sit in the shade and smoke and do nothing.</p>

  <p>'And a mighty soft crowd you must be at that,' he said, 'to be bullied by
  these stuck-up josses because they walk about in their mitres and their
  tiaras and their gold copes and other glad rags, looking down on everybody
  else like dirt&mdash;being bamboozled by crowns and canopies and sacred
  umbrellas like a kid at a pantomime; just because a pompous old High Priest
  of Mumbo-Jumbo looks as if he was the lord of the earth. What about you? What
  do you look like, you poor simps? I tell you, that's why you're way-back in
  barbarism and can't read or write and&mdash;'</p>

  <p>At this point the High Priest of Mumbo-Jumbo came in an undignified hurry
  out of the door of the mission-house, not looking very like a lord of the
  earth, but rather like a bundle of black second-hand clothes buttoned round a
  short bolster in the semblance of a guy. He was not wearing his tiara,
  supposing him to possess one, but a shabby broad hat not very dissimilar from
  those of the Spanish Indians, and it was thrust to the back of his head with
  a gesture of botheration. He seemed just about to speak to the motionless
  natives when he caught sight of the stranger and said quickly:</p>

  <p>'Oh, can I be of any assistance? Would you like to come inside?'</p>

  <p>Mr Paul Snaith came inside; and it was the beginning of a considerable
  increase of that journalist's information on many things. Presumably his
  journalistic instinct was stronger than his prejudices, as, indeed, it often
  is in clever journalists; and he asked a good many questions, the answers to
  which interested and surprised him. He discovered that the Indians could read
  and write, for the simple reason that the priest had taught them; but that
  they did not read or write any more than they could help, from a natural
  preference for more direct communications. He learned that these strange
  people, who sat about in heaps on the veranda without stirring a hair, could
  work quite hard on their own patches of land; especially those of them who
  were more than half Spanish; and he learned with still more astonishment that
  they all had patches of land that were really their own. That much was part
  of a stubborn tradition that seemed quite native to natives. But in that also
  the priest had played a certain part, and by doing so had taken perhaps what
  was his first and last part in politics, if it was only local politics.</p>

  <p>There had recently swept through that region one of those fevers of
  atheist and almost anarchist Radicalism which break out periodically in
  countries of the Latin culture, generally beginning in a secret society and
  generally ending in a civil war and in very little else. The local leader of
  the iconoclastic party was a certain Alvarez, a rather picturesque adventurer
  of Portuguese nationality but, as his enemies said, of partly Negro origin,
  the head of any number of lodges and temples of initiation of the sort that
  in such places clothe even atheism with something mystical. The leader on the
  more conservative side was a much more commonplace person, a very wealthy man
  named Mendoza, the owner of many factories and quite respectable, but not
  very exciting. It was the general opinion that the cause of law and order
  would have been entirely lost if it had not adopted a more popular policy of
  its own, in the form of securing land for the peasants; and this movement had
  mainly originated from the little mission-station of Father Brown.</p>

  <p>While he was talking to the journalist, Mendoza, the Conservative leader,
  came in. He was a stout, dark man, with a bald head like a pear and a round
  body also like a pear; he was smoking a very fragrant cigar, but he threw it
  away, perhaps a little theatrically, when he came into the presence of the
  priest, as if he had been entering church; and bowed with a curve that in so
  corpulent a gentleman seemed quite improbable. He was always exceedingly
  serious in his social gestures, especially towards religious institutions. He
  was one of those laymen who are much more ecclesiastical than ecclesiastics.
  It embarrassed Father Brown a good deal, especially when carried thus into
  private life.</p>

  <p>'I think I am an anti-clerical,' Father Brown would say with a faint
  smile; 'but there wouldn't be half so much clericalism if they would only
  leave things to the clerics.'</p>

  <p>'Why Mr Mendoza,' exclaimed the journalist with a new animation,' I think
  we have met before. Weren't you at the Trade Congress in Mexico last
  year?'</p>

  <p>The heavy eyelids of Mr Mendoza showed a flutter of recognition, and he
  smiled in his slow way. 'I remember.'</p>

  <p>'Pretty big business done there in an hour or two,' said Snaith with
  relish.' Made a good deal of difference to you, too, I guess.'</p>

  <p>'I have been very fortunate,' said Mendoza modestly.</p>

  <p>'Don't you believe it!' cried the enthusiastic Snaith.' Good fortune comes
  to the people who know when to catch hold; and you caught hold good and sure.
  But I hope I'm not interrupting your business?'</p>

  <p>'Not at all,' said the other. 'I often have the honour of calling on the
  padre for a little talk. Merely for a little talk.'</p>

  <p>It seemed as if this familiarity between Father Brown and a successful and
  even famous man of business completed the reconciliation between the priest
  and the practical Mr Snaith. He felt, it might be supposed, a new
  respectability clothe the station and the mission, and was ready to overlook
  such occasional reminders of the existence of religion as a chapel and a
  presbytery can seldom wholly avoid. He became quite enthusiastic about the
  priest's programme&mdash;at least on its secular and social side&mdash;and
  announced himself ready at any moment to act in the capacity of a live wire
  for its communication to the world at large. And it was at this point that
  Father Brown began to find the journalist rather more troublesome in his
  sympathy than in his hostility.</p>

  <p>Mr Paul Snaith set out vigorously to feature Father Brown. He sent long
  and loud eulogies on him across the continent to his newspaper in the Middle
  West. He took snapshots of the unfortunate cleric in the most commonplace
  occupations, and exhibited them in gigantic photographs in the gigantic
  Sunday papers of the United States. He turned his sayings into slogans, and
  was continually presenting the world with 'A message' from the reverend
  gentleman in South America. Any stock less strong and strenuously receptive
  than the American race would have become very much bored with Father Brown.
  As it was, he received handsome and eager offers to go on a lecturing tour in
  the States; and when he declined, the terms were raised with expressions of
  respectful wonder. A series of stories about him, like the stories of
  Sherlock Holmes, were, by the instrumentality of Mr Snaith, planned out and
  put before the hero with requests for his assistance and encouragement. As
  the priest found they had started, he could offer no suggestion except that
  they should stop. And this in turn was taken by Mr Snaith as the text for a
  discussion on whether Father Brown should disappear temporarily over a cliff,
  in the manner of Dr Watson's hero. To all these demands the priest had
  patiently to reply in writing, saying that he would consent on such terms to
  the temporary cessation of the stories and begging that a considerable
  interval might occur before they began again. The notes he wrote grew shorter
  and shorter; and as he wrote the last of them, he sighed.</p>

  <p>Needless to say, this strange boom in the North reacted on the little
  outpost in the South where he had expected to live in so lonely an exile. The
  considerable English and American population already on the spot began to be
  proud of possessing so widely advertised a person. American tourists, of the
  sort who land with a loud demand for Westminster Abbey, landed on that
  distant coast with a loud demand for Father Brown. They were within
  measurable distance of running excursion trains named after him, and bringing
  crowds to see him as if he were a public monument. He was especially troubled
  by the active and ambitious new traders and shopkeepers of the place, who
  were perpetually pestering him to try their wares and to give them
  testimonials. Even if the testimonials were not forthcoming, they would
  prolong the correspondence for the purpose of collecting autographs. As he
  was a good-natured person they got a good deal of what they wanted out of
  him; and it was in answer to a particular request from a Frankfort
  wine-merchant named Eckstein that he wrote hastily a few words on a card,
  which were to prove a terrible turning-point in his life.</p>

  <p>Eckstein was a fussy little man with fuzzy hair and pince-nez, who was
  wildly anxious that the priest should not only try some of his celebrated
  medicinal port, but should let him know where and when he would drink it, in
  acknowledging its receipt. The priest was not particularly surprised at the
  request, for he was long past surprise at the lunacies of advertisement. So
  he scribbled something down and turned to other business which seemed a
  little more sensible. He was again interrupted, by a note from no less a
  person than his political enemy Alvarez, asking him to come to a conference
  at which it was hoped that a compromise on an outstanding question might be
  reached; and suggesting an appointment that evening at a cafe just outside
  the walls of the little town. To this also he sent a message of acceptance by
  the rather florid and military messenger who was waiting for it; and then,
  having an hour or two before him, sat down to attempt to get through a little
  of his own legitimate business. At the end of the time he poured himself out
  a glass of Mr Eckstein's remarkable wine and, glancing at the clock with a
  humorous expression, drank it and went out into the night.</p>

  <p>Strong moonlight lay on the little Spanish town, so that when he came to
  the picturesque gateway, with its rather rococo arch and the fantastic fringe
  of palms beyond it, it looked rather like a scene in a Spanish opera. One
  long leaf of palm with jagged edges, black against the moon, hung down on the
  other side of the arch, visible through the archway, and had something of the
  look of the jaw of a black crocodile. The fancy would not have lingered in
  his imagination but for something else that caught his naturally alert eye.
  The air was deathly still, and there was not a stir of wind; but he
  distinctly saw the pendent palm-leaf move.</p>

  <p>He looked around him and realized that he was alone. He had left behind
  the last houses, which were mostly closed and shuttered, and was walking
  between two long blank walls built of large and shapeless but flattened
  stones, tufted here and there with the queer prickly weeds of that
  region&mdash;walls which ran parallel all the way to the gateway. He could
  not see the lights of the cafe outside the gate; probably it was too far
  away. Nothing could be seen under the arch but a wider expanse of
  large-flagged pavement, pale in the moon, with the straggling prickly pear
here and
  there. He had a strong sense of the smell of evil; he felt queer physical
  oppression; but he did not think of stopping. His courage, which was
  considerable, was perhaps even less strong a part of him than his curiosity.
  All his life he had been led by an intellectual hunger for the truth, even of
  trifles. He often controlled it in the name of proportion; but it was always
  there. He walked straight through the gateway, and on the other side a man
  sprang like a monkey out of the tree-top and struck at him with a knife. At
  the same moment another man came crawling swiftly along the wall and,
  whirling a cudgel round his head, brought it down. Father Brown turned,
  staggered, and sank in a heap, but as he sank there dawned on his round face
  an expression of mild and immense surprise.</p>

  <p>There was living in the same little town at this time another young
  American, particularly different from Mr Paul Snaith. His name was John Adams
  Race, and he was an electrical engineer, employed by Mendoza to fit out the
  old town with all the new conveniences. He was a figure far less familiar in
  satire and international gossip than that of the American journalist. Yet, as
  a matter of fact, America contains a million men of the moral type of Race to
  one of the moral type of Snaith. He was exceptional in being exceptionally
  good at his job, but in every other way he was very simple. He had begun life
  as a druggist's assistant in a Western village, and risen by sheer work and
  merit; but he still regarded his home town as the natural heart of the
  habitable world. He had been taught a very Puritan, or purely Evangelical,
  sort of Christianity from the Family Bible at his mother's knee; and in so
  far as he had time to have any religion, that was still his religion. Amid
  all the dazzling lights of the latest and even wildest discoveries, when he
  was at the very edge and extreme of experiment, working miracles of light and
  sound like a god creating new stars and solar systems, he never for a moment
  doubted that the things 'back home' were the best things in the world; his
  mother and the Family Bible and the quiet and quaint morality of his village.
  He had as serious and noble a sense of the sacredness of his mother as if he
  had been a frivolous Frenchman. He was quite sure the Bible religion was
  really the right thing; only he vaguely missed it wherever he went in the
  modern world. He could hardly be expected to sympathize with the religious
  externals of Catholic countries; and in a dislike of mitres and croziers he
  sympathized with Mr Snaith, though not in so cocksure a fashion. He had no
  liking for the public bowings and scrapings of Mendoza and certainly no
  temptation to the masonic mysticism of the atheist Alvarez. Perhaps all that
  semi-tropical life was too coloured for him, shot with Indian red and
  Spanish gold. Anyhow, when he said there was nothing to touch his home town,
  he was not boasting. He really meant that there was somewhere something plain
  and unpretentious and touching, which he really respected more than anything
  else in the world. Such being the mental attitude of John Adams Race in a
  South American station, there had been growing on him for some time a curious
  feeling, which contradicted all his prejudices and for which he could not
  account. For the truth was this: that the only thing he had ever met in his
  travels that in the least reminded him of the old wood-pile and the
  provincial proprieties and the Bible on his mother's knee was (for some
  inscrutable reason) the round face and black clumsy umbrella of Father
  Brown.</p>

  <p>He found himself insensibly watching that commonplace and even comic black
  figure as it went bustling about; watching it with an almost morbid
  fascination, as if it were a walking riddle or contradiction. He had found
  something he could not help liking in the heart of everything he hated; it
  was as if he had been horribly tormented by lesser demons and then found that
  the Devil was quite an ordinary person.</p>

  <p>Thus it happened that, looking out of his window on that moonlit night, he
  saw the Devil go by, the demon of unaccountable blamelessness, in his broad
  black hat and long black coat, shuffling along the street towards the
  gateway, and saw it with an interest which he could not himself understand.
  He wondered where the priest was going, and what he was really up to; and
  remained gazing out into the moonlit street long after the little black
  figure had passed. And then he saw something else that intrigued him further.
  Two other men whom he recognized passed across his window as across a lighted
  stage. A sort of blue limelight of the moon ran in a spectral halo round the
  big bush of hair that stood erect on the head of little Eckstein, the
  wine-seller, and it outlined a taller and darker figure with an eagle profile
  and a queer old-fashioned and very top-heavy black hat, which seemed to
  make the whole outline still more bizarre, like a shape in a shadow
  pantomime. Race rebuked himself for allowing the moon to play such tricks
  with his fancy; for on a second glance he recognized the black Spanish
  sidewhiskers and high-featured face of Dr Calderon, a worthy medical man of
  the town, whom he had once found attending professionally on Mendoza. Still,
  there was something in the way the men were whispering to each other and
  peering up the street that struck him as peculiar. On a sudden impulse he
  leapt over the low window-sill and himself went bareheaded up the road,
  following their trail. He saw them disappear under the dark archway, and a
  moment after there came a dreadful cry from beyond; curiously loud and
  piercing, and all the more blood-curdling to Race because it said something
  very distinctly in some tongue that he did not know.</p>

  <p>The next moment there was a rushing of feet, more cries, and then a
  confused roar of rage or grief that shook the turrets and tall palm trees of
  the place; there was a movement in the mob that had gathered, as if they were
  sweeping backwards through the gateway. And then the dark archway resounded
  with a new voice, this time intelligible to him and falling with the note of
  doom, as someone shouted through the gateway:</p>

  <p>'Father Brown is dead!'</p>

  <p>He never knew what prop gave way in his mind, or why something on which he
  had been counting suddenly failed him; but he ran towards the gateway and was
  just in time to meet his countryman, the journalist Snaith, coming out of the
  dark entrance, deadly pale and snapping his fingers nervously.</p>

  <p>'It's quite true,' said Snaith, with something which for him approached to
  reverence. 'He's a goner. The doctor's been looking at him, and there's no
  hope. Some of these damned Dagos clubbed him as he came through the
  gate&mdash;God knows why. It'll be a great loss to the place.'</p>

  <p>Race did not or perhaps could not reply, but ran on under the arch to the
  scene beyond. The small black figure lay where it had fallen on the
  wilderness of wide stones starred here and there with green thorn; and the
  great crowd was being kept back, chiefly by the mere gestures of one gigantic
  figure in the foreground. For there were many there who swayed hither and
  thither at the mere movement of his hand, as if he had been a magician.</p>

  <p>Alvarez, the dictator and demagogue, was a tall, swaggering figure, always
  rather flamboyantly clad, and on this occasion he wore a green uniform with
  embroideries like silver snakes crawling all over it, with an order round his
  neck hung on a very vivid maroon ribbon. His close curling hair was already
  grey, and in contrast his complexion, which his friends called olive and his
  foes octoroon, looked almost literally golden, as if it were a mask moulded
  in gold. But his large-featured face, which was powerful and humorous, was at
  this moment properly grave and grim. He had been waiting, he explained, for
  Father Brown at the cafe when he had heard a rustle and a fall and, coming
  out, had found the corpse lying on the flagstones.</p>

  <p>'I know what some of you are thinking,' he said, looking round proudly,
  'and if you are afraid of me&mdash;as you are&mdash;I will say it for you. I
  am an atheist; I have no god to call on for those who will not take my word.
  But I tell you in the name of every root of honour that may be left to a
  soldier and a man, that I had no part in this. If I had the men here that did
  it, I would rejoice to hang them on that tree.'</p>

  <p>'Naturally we are glad to hear you say so,' said old Mendoza stiffly and
  solemnly, standing by the body of his fallen coadjutor. 'This blow has been
  too appalling for us to say what else we feel at present. I suggest that it
  will be more decent and proper if we remove my friend's body and break up
  this irregular meeting. I understand,' he added gravely to the doctor, 'that
  there is unfortunately no doubt.'</p>

  <p>'There is no doubt,' said Dr Calderon.</p>

  <p>John Race went back to his lodgings sad and with a singular sense of
  emptiness. It seemed impossible that he should miss a man whom he never knew.
  He learned that the funeral was to take place next day; for all felt that the
  crisis should be past as quickly as possible, for fear of riots that were
  hourly growing more probable. When Snaith had seen the row of Red Indians
  sitting on the veranda, they might have been a row of ancient Aztec images
  carved in red wood. But he had not seen them as they were when they heard
  that the priest was dead.</p>

  <p>Indeed they would certainly have risen in revolution and lynched the
  republican leader, if they had not been immediately blocked by the direct
  necessity of behaving respectfully to the coffin of their own religious
  leader. The actual assassins, whom it would have been most natural to lynch,
  seemed to have vanished into thin air. Nobody knew their names; and nobody
  would ever know whether the dying man had even seen their faces. That strange
  look of surprise that was apparently his last look on earth might have been
  the recognition of their faces. Alvarez repeated violently that it was no
  work of his, and attended the funeral, walking behind the coffin in his
  splendid silver and green uniform with a sort of bravado of reverence.</p>

  <p>Behind the veranda a flight of stone steps scaled a very steep green bank,
  fenced by a cactus-hedge, and up this the coffin was laboriously lifted to
  the ground above, and placed temporarily at the foot of the great gaunt
  crucifix that dominated the road and guarded the consecrated ground. Below in
  the road were great seas of people lamenting and telling their beads&mdash;an
  orphan population that had lost a father. Despite all these symbols that were
  provocative enough to him, Alvarez behaved with restraint and respect; and
  all would have gone well&mdash;as Race told himself&mdash;had the others only
  let him alone.</p>

  <p>Race told himself bitterly that old Mendoza had always looked like an old
  fool and had now very conspicuously and completely behaved like an old fool.
  By a custom common in simpler societies, the coffin was left open and the
  face uncovered, bringing the pathos to the point of agony for all those
  simple people. This, being consonant to tradition, need have done no harm;
  but some officious person had added to it the custom of the French
  freethinkers, of having speeches by the graveside. Mendoza proceeded to make
  a speech&mdash;a rather long speech, and the longer it was, the longer and
  lower sank John Race's spirits and sympathies with the religious ritual
  involved. A list of saintly attributes, apparently of the most antiquated
  sort, was rolled out with the dilatory dullness of an after-dinner speaker
  who does not know how to sit down. That was bad enough; but Mendoza had also
  the ineffable stupidity to start reproaching and even taunting his political
  opponents. In three minutes he had succeeded in making a scene, and a very
  extraordinary scene it was.</p>

  <p>'We may well ask,' he said, looking around him pompously; 'we may well ask
  where such virtues can be found among those who have madly abandoned the
  creed of their fathers. It is when we have atheists among us, atheist
  leaders, nay sometimes even atheist rulers, that we find their infamous
  philosophy bearing fruit in crimes like this. If we ask who murdered this
  holy man, we shall assuredly find&mdash;'</p>

  <p>Africa of the forests looked out of the eyes of Alvarez the hybrid
  adventurer; and Race fancied he could see suddenly that the man was after all
  a barbarian, who could not control himself to the end; one might guess that
  all his 'illuminated' transcendentalism had a touch of Voodoo. Anyhow,
  Mendoza could not continue, for Alvarez had sprung up and was shouting back
  at him and shouting him down, with infinitely superior lungs.</p>

  <p>'Who murdered him?' he roared. 'Your God murdered him! His own God
  murdered him! According to you, he murders all his faithful and foolish
  servants&mdash;as he murdered that one,' and he made a violent gesture, not
  towards the coffin but the crucifix. Seeming to control himself a little, he
  went on in a tone still angry but more argumentative: 'I don't believe it,
  but you do. Isn't it better to have no God than one that robs you in this
  fashion? I, at least, am not afraid to say that there is none. There is no
  power in all this blind and brainless universe that can hear your prayer or
  return your friend. Though you beg Heaven to raise him, he will not rise.
  Though I dare Heaven to raise him, he will not rise. Here and now I will put
  it to the test&mdash;I defy the God who is not there to waken the man who
  sleeps for ever.'</p>

  <p>There was a shock of silence, and the demagogue had made his
  sensation.</p>

  <p>'We might have known,' cried Mendoza in a thick gobbling voice, 'when we
  allowed such men as you&mdash;'</p>

  <p>A new voice cut into his speech; a high and shrill voice with a Yankee
  accent.</p>

  <p>'Stop! Stop!' cried Snaith the journalist; 'something's up! I swear I saw
  him move.'</p>

  <p>He went racing up the steps and rushed to the coffin, while the mob below
  swayed with indescribable frenzies. The next moment he had turned a face of
  amazement over his shoulder and made a signal with his finger to Dr Calderon,
  who hastened forward to confer with him. When the two men stepped away again
  from the coffin, all could see that the position of the head had altered. A
  roar of excitement rose from the crowd and seemed to stop suddenly, as if cut
  off in mid-air; for the priest in the coffin gave a groan and raised himself
  on one elbow, looking with bleared and blinking eyes at the crowd.</p>

  <p>John Adams Race, who had hitherto known only miracles of science, never
  found himself able in after-years to describe the topsy-turvydom of the next
  few days. He seemed to have burst out of the world of time and space, and to
  be living in the impossible. In half an hour the whole of that town and
  district had been transformed into something never known for a thousand
  years; a medieval people turned to a mob of monks by a staggering miracle; a
  Greek city where the god had descended among men. Thousands prostrated
  themselves in the road; hundreds took vows on the spot; and even the
  outsiders, like the two Americans, were able to think and speak of nothing
  but the prodigy. Alvarez himself was shaken, as well he might be; and sat
  down, with his head upon his hands.</p>

  <p>And in the midst of all this tornado of beatitude was a little man
  struggling to be heard. His voice was small and faint, and the noise was
  deafening. He made weak little gestures that seemed more those of irritation
  than anything else. He came to the edge of the parapet above the crowd,
  waving it to be quiet, with movements rather like the flap of the short wings
  of a penguin. There was something a little more like a lull in the noise; and
  then Father Brown for the first time reached the utmost stretch of the
  indignation that he could launch against his children.</p>

  <p>'Oh, you silly people,' he said in a high and quavering voice; 'Oh, you
  silly, silly people.'</p>

  <p>Then he suddenly seemed to pull himself together, made a bolt for the
  steps with his more normal gait, and began hurriedly to descend.</p>

  <p>'Where are you going, Father?' said Mendoza, with more than his usual
  veneration.</p>

  <p>'To the telegraph office,' said Father Brown hastily. 'What? No; of course
  it's not a miracle. Why should there be a miracle? Miracles are not so cheap
  as all that.'</p>

  <p>And he came tumbling down the steps, the people flinging themselves before
  him to implore his blessing.</p>

  <p>'Bless you, bless you,' said Father Brown hastily. 'God bless you all and
  give you more sense.'</p>

  <p>And he scuttled away with extraordinary rapidity to the telegraph office,
  where he wired to his Bishop's secretary: 'There is some mad story about a
  miracle here; hope his lordship not give authority. Nothing in it.'</p>

  <p>As he turned away from his effort, he tottered a little with the reaction,
  and John Race caught him by the arm.</p>

  <p>'Let me see you home,' he said; 'you deserve more than these people are
  giving you.'</p>

  <p>John Race and the priest were seated in the presbytery; the table was
  still piled up with the papers with which the latter had been wrestling the
  day before; the bottle of wine and the emptied wine-glass still stood where
  he had left them.</p>

  <p>'And now,' said Father Brown almost grimly, 'I can begin to think.'</p>

  <p>'I shouldn't think too hard just yet,' said the American. 'You must be
  wanting a rest. Besides, what are you going to think about?'</p>

  <p>'I have pretty often had the task of investigating murders, as it
  happens,' said Father Brown. 'Now I have got to investigate my own
  murder.'</p>

  <p>'If I were you,' said Race, 'I should take a little wine first.'</p>

  <p>Father Brown stood up and filled himself another glass, lifted it, looked
  thoughtfully into vacancy, and put it down again. Then he sat down once more
  and said:</p>

  <p>'Do you know what I felt like when I died? You may not believe it, but my
  feeling was one of overwhelming astonishment.'</p>

  <p>'Well,' answered Race, 'I suppose you were astonished at being knocked on
  the head.'</p>

  <p>Father Brown leaned over to him and said in a low voice, 'I was astonished
  at not being knocked on the head.'</p>

  <p>Race looked at him for a moment as if he thought the knock on the head had
  been only too effective; but he only said: 'What do you mean?'</p>

  <p>'I mean that when that man brought his bludgeon down with a great swipe,
  it stopped at my head and did not even touch it. In the same way, the other
  fellow made as if to strike me with a knife, but he never gave me a scratch.
  It was just like play-acting. I think it was. But then followed the
  extraordinary thing.'</p>

  <p>He looked thoughtfully at the papers on the table for a moment and then
  went on:</p>

  <p>'Though I had not even been touched with knife or stick, I began to feel
  my legs doubling up under me and my very life failing. I knew I was being
  struck down by something, but it was not by those weapons. Do you know what I
  think it was?' And he pointed to the wine on the table.</p>

  <p>Race picked up the wine-glass and looked at it and smelt it.</p>

  <p>'I think you are right,' he said. 'I began as a druggist and studied
  chemistry. I couldn't say for certain without an analysis; but I think
  there's something very unusual in this stuff. There are drugs by which the
  Asiatics produce a temporary sleep that looks like death.'</p>

  <p>'Quite so,' said the priest calmly.' The whole of this miracle was faked,
  for some reason or other. That funeral scene was staged&mdash;and timed. I
  think it is part of that raving madness of publicity that has got hold of
  Snaith; but I can hardly believe he would go quite so far, merely for that.
  After all, it's one thing to make copy out of me and run me as a sort of sham
  Sherlock Holmes, and&mdash;'</p>

  <p>Even as the priest spoke his face altered. His blinking eyelids shut
  suddenly and he stood up as if he were choking. Then he put one wavering hand
  as if groping his way towards the door.</p>

  <p>'Where are you going?' asked the other in some wonder.</p>

  <p>'If you ask me,' said Father Brown, who was quite white, 'I was going to
  pray. Or rather, to praise.'</p>

  <p>'I'm not sure I understand. What is the matter with you?'</p>

  <p>'I was going to praise God for having so strangely and so incredibly saved
  me&mdash;saved me by an inch.'</p>

  <p>'Of course,' said Race, 'I am not of your religion; but believe me, I have
  religion enough to understand that. Of course, you would thank God for saving
  you from death.'</p>

  <p>'No,' said the priest. 'Not from death. From disgrace.'</p>

  <p>The other sat staring; and the priest's next words broke out of him with a
  sort of cry. 'And if it had only been my disgrace! But it was the disgrace of
  all I stand for; the disgrace of the Faith that they went about to encompass.
  What it might have been! The most huge and horrible scandal ever launched
  against us since the last lie was choked in the throat of Titus Oates.'</p>

  <p>'What on earth are you talking about?' demanded his companion.</p>

  <p>'Well, I had better tell you at once,' said the priest; and sitting down,
  he went on more composedly: 'It came to me in a flash when I happened to
  mention Snaith and Sherlock Holmes. Now I happen to remember what I wrote
  about his absurd scheme; it was the natural thing to write, and yet I think
  they had ingeniously manoeuvred me into writing just those words. They were
  something like 'I am ready to die and come to life again like Sherlock
  Holmes, if that is the best way.' And the moment I thought of that, I
  realized that I had been made to write all sorts of things of that kind, all
  pointing to the same idea. I wrote, as if to an accomplice, saying that I
  would drink the drugged wine at a particular time. Now, don't you see?'</p>

  <p>Race sprang to his feet still staring: 'Yes,' he said, 'I think I began to
  see.'</p>

  <p>'They would have boomed the miracle. Then they would have bust up the
  miracle. And what is the worst, they would have proved that I was in the
  conspiracy. It would have been our sham miracle. That's all there is to it;
  and about as near hell as you and I will ever be, I hope.'</p>

  <p>Then he said, after a pause, in quite a mild voice: 'They certainly would
  have got quite a lot of good copy out of me.'</p>

  <p>Race looked at the table and said darkly: 'How many of these brutes were
  in it?'</p>

  <p>Father Brown shook his head. 'More than I like to think of,' he said; 'but
  I hope some of them were only tools. Alvarez might think that all's fair in
  war, perhaps; he has a queer mind. I'm very much afraid that Mendoza is an
  old hypocrite; I never trusted him, and he hated my action in an industrial
  matter. But all that will wait; I have only got to thank God for the escape.
  And especially that I wired at once to the Bishop.'</p>

  <p>John Race appeared to be very thoughtful. 'You've told me a lot I didn't
  know,' he said at last, 'and I feel inclined to tell you the only thing you
  don't know. I can imagine how those fellows calculated well enough. They
  thought any man alive, waking up in a coffin to find himself canonized like a
  saint, and made into a walking miracle for everyone to admire, would be swept
  along with his worshippers and accept the crown of glory that fell on him out
  the sky. And I reckon their calculation was pretty practical psychology, as
  men go. I've seen all sorts of men in all sorts of places; and I tell you
  frankly I don't believe there's one man in a thousand who could wake up like
  that with all his wits about him; and while he was still almost talking in
  his sleep, would have the sanity and the simplicity and the humility
  to&mdash;' He was much surprised to find himself moved, and his level voice
  wavering.</p>

  <p>Father Brown was gazing abstractedly, and in a rather cockeyed fashion, at
  the bottle on the table. 'Look here,' he said, ' what about a bottle of real
  wine?'</p>

  <h2><a id="story2"
     name="story2">II.&mdash;THE ARROW OF HEAVEN</a></h2>

<h3>(No record of prior magazine publication found)</h3>

  <p class="first">IT is to be feared that about a hundred detective stories
  have begun with the discovery that an American millionaire has been murdered;
  an event which is, for some reason, treated as a sort of calamity. This
  story, I am happy to say, has to begin with a murdered millionaire; in one
  sense, indeed, it has to begin with three murdered millionaires, which some
  may regard as an cmbarras de richesse. But it was chiefly this coincidence or
  continuity of criminal policy that took the whole affair out of the ordinary
  run of criminal cases and made it the extraordinary problem that it was.</p>

  <p>It was very generally said that they had all fallen victims to some
  vendetta or curse attaching to the possession of a relic of great value both
  intrinsically and historically: a sort of chalice inlaid with precious stones
  and commonly called the Coptic Cup. Its origin was obscure, but its use was
  conjectured to be religious; and some attributed the fate that followed its
  possessors to the fanaticism of some Oriental Christian horrified at its
  passing through such materialistic hands. But the mysterious slayer, whether
  or no he was such a fanatic, was already a figure of lurid and sensational
  interest in the world of journalism and gossip. The nameless being was
  provided with a name, or a nickname. But it is only with the story of the
  third victim that we are now concerned; for it was only in this case that a
  certain Father Brown, who is the subject of these sketches, had an
  opportunity of making his presence felt.</p>

  <p>When Father Brown first stepped off an Atlantic liner on to American soil,
  he discovered as many other Englishman has done, that he was a much more
  important person than he had ever supposed. His short figure, his
  short-sighted and undistinguished countenance, his rather rusty-black
  clerical clothes, could pass through any crowd in his own country without
  being noticed as anything unusual, except perhaps unusually insignificant.
  But America has a genius for the encouragement of fame; and his appearance in
  one or two curious criminal problems, together with his long association with
  Flambeau, the ex-criminal and detective, had consolidated a reputation in
  America out of what was little more than a rumour in England. His round face
  was blank with surprise when he found himself held up on the quay by a group
  of journalists, as by a gang of brigands, who asked him questions about all
  the subjects on which he was least likely to regard himself as an authority,
  such as the details of female dress and the criminal statistics of the
  country that he had only that moment clapped his eyes on. Perhaps it was the
  contrast with the black embattled solidarity of this group that made more
  vivid another figure that stood apart from it, equally black against the
  burning white daylight of that brilliant place and season, but entirely
  solitary; a tall, rather yellow-faced man in great goggles, who arrested him
  with a gesture when the journalists had finished and said: 'Excuse me, but
  maybe you are looking for Captain Wain.'</p>

  <p>Some apology may be made for Father Brown; for he himself would have been
  sincerely apologetic. It must be remembered that he had never seen America
  before, and more especially that he had never seen that sort of
  tortoise-shell spectacles before; for the fashion at this time had not spread
  to England. His first sensation was that of gazing at some goggling
  sea-monster with a faint suggestion of a diver's helmet. Otherwise the man
  was exquisitely dressed; and to Brown, in his innocence, the spectacles
  seemed the queerest disfigurement for a dandy. It was as if a dandy had
  adorned himself with a wooden leg as an extra touch of elegance. The question
  also embarrassed him. An American aviator of the name of Wain, a friend of
  some friends of his own in France, was indeed one of a long list of people he
  had some hope of seeing during his American visit; but he had never expected
  to hear of him so soon.</p>

  <p>'I beg your pardon,' he said doubtfully, 'are you Captain Wain? Do
you&mdash;
  do you know him?'</p>

  <p>'Well, I'm pretty confident I'm not Captain Wain,' said the man in
  goggles, with a face of wood. 'I was pretty clear about that when I saw him
  waiting for you over there in the car. But the other question's a bit more
  problematical. I reckon I know Wain and his uncle, and old man Merton, too. I
  know old man Merton, but old man Merton don't know me. And he thinks he has
  the advantage, and I think I have the advantage. See?'</p>

  <p>Father Brown did not quite see. He blinked at the glittering seascape and
  the pinnacles of the city, and then at the man in goggles. It was not only
  the masking of the man's eyes that produced the impression of something
  impenetrable. Something in his yellow face was almost Asiatic, even Chinese;
  and his conversation seemed to consist of stratified layers of irony. He was
  a type to be found here and there in that hearty and sociable population; he
  was the inscrutable American.</p>

  <p>'My name's Drage,' he said, 'Norman Drage, and I'm an American citizen,
  which explains everything. At least I imagine your friend Wain would like to
  explain the rest; so we'll postpone The Fourth of July till another
  date.'</p>

  <p>Father Brown was dragged in a somewhat dazed condition towards a car at
  some little distance, in which a young man with tufts of untidy yellow hair
  and a rather harassed and haggard expression, hailed him from afar, and
  presented himself as Peter Wain. Before he knew where he was he was stowed in
  the car and travelling with considerable speed through and beyond the city.
  He was unused to the impetuous practicality of such American action, and felt
  about as bewildered as if a chariot drawn by dragons had carried him away
  into fairyland. It was under these disconcerting conditions that he heard for
  the first time, in long monologues from Wain, and short sentences from Drage,
  the story of the Coptic Cup and the two crimes already connected with it.</p>

  <p>It seemed that Wain had an uncle named Crake who had a partner named
  Merton, who was number three in the series of rich business men to whom the
  cup had belonged. The first of them, Titus P. Trant, the Copper King, had
  received threatening letters from somebody signing himself Daniel Doom. The
  name was presumably a pseudonym, but it had come to stand for a very public
  if not a very popular character; for somebody as well known as Robin Hood and
  Jack the Ripper combined. For it soon became clear that the writer of the
  threatening letter did not confine himself to threatening. Anyhow, the upshot
  was that old Trant was found one morning with his head in his own lily-pond,
  and there was not the shadow of a clue. The cup was, fortunately, safe in the
  bank; and it passed with the rest of Trant's property to his cousin, Brian
  Horder, who was also a man of great wealth and who was also threatened by the
  nameless enemy. Brian Horder was picked up dead at the foot of a cliff
  outside his seaside residence, at which there was a burglary, this time on a
  large scale. For though the cup apparently again escaped, enough bonds and
  securities were stolen to leave Horder's financial affairs in confusion.</p>

  <p>'Brian Horder's widow,' explained Wain, 'had to sell most of his
  valuables, I believe, and Brander Merton must have purchased the cup at that
  time, for he had it when I first knew him. But you can guess for yourself
  that it's not a very comfortable thing to have.'</p>

  <p>'Has Mr Merton ever had any of the threatening letters?' asked Father
  Brown, after a pause.</p>

  <p>'I imagine he has,' said Mr Drage; and something in his voice made the
  priest look at him curiously, until he realized that the man in goggles was
  laughing silently, in a fashion that gave the newcomer something of a
  chill.</p>

  <p>'I'm pretty sure he has,' said Peter Wain, frowning. 'I've not seen the
  letters, only his secretary sees any of his letters, for he is pretty
  reticent about business matters, as big business men have to be. But I've
  seen him real upset and annoyed with letters; and letters that he tore up,
  too, before even his secretary saw them. The secretary himself is getting
  nervous and says he is sure somebody is laying for the old man; and the long
  and the short of it is, that we'd be very grateful for a little advice in the
  matter. Everybody knows your great reputation. Father Brown, and the
  secretary asked me to see if you'd mind coming straight out to the Merton
  house at once.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, I see,' said Father Brown, on whom the meaning of this apparent
  kidnapping began to dawn at last. 'But, really, I don't see that I can do any
  more than you can. You're on the spot, and must have a hundred times more
  data for a scientific conclusion than a chance visitor.'</p>

  <p>'Yes,' said Mr Drage dryly; 'our conclusions are much too scientific to be
  true. I reckon if anything hit a man like Titus P. Trant, it just came out of
  the sky without waiting for any scientific explanation. What they call a bolt
  from the blue.'</p>

  <p>'You can't possibly mean,' cried Wain, 'that it was supernatural!'</p>

  <p>But it was by no means easy at any time to discover what Mr Drage could
  possibly mean; except that if he said somebody was a real smart man, he very
  probably meant he was a fool. Mr Drage maintained an Oriental immobility
  until the car stopped, a little while after, at what was obviously their
  destination. It was rather a singular place. They had been driving through a
  thinly-wooded country that opened into a wide plain, and just in front of
  them was a building consisting of a single wall or very high fence, round,
  like a Roman camp, and having rather the appearance of an aerodrome. The
  barrier did not look like wood or stone, and closer inspection proved it to
  be of metal.</p>

  <p>They all alighted from the car, and one small door in the wall was slid
  open with considerable caution, after manipulations resembling the opening of
  a safe. But, much to Father Brown's surprise, the man called Norman Drage
  showed no disposition to enter, but took leave of them with sinister
  gaiety.</p>

  <p>'I won't come in,' he said. 'It 'ud be too much pleasurable excitement for
  old man Merton, I reckon. He loves the sight of me so much that he'd die of
  joy.'</p>

  <p>And he strode away, while Father Brown, with increasing wonder, was
  admitted through the steel door which instantly clicked behind him. Inside
  was a large and elaborate garden of gay and varied colours, but entirely
  without any trees or tall shrubs or flowers. In the centre of it rose a house
  of handsome and even striking architecture, but so high and narrow as rather
  to resemble a tower. The burning sunlight gleamed on glass roofing here and
  there at the top, but there seemed to be no windows at all in the lower part
  of it. Over everything was that spotless and sparkling cleanliness that
  seemed so native to the clear American air. When they came inside the portal,
  they stood amid resplendent marble and metals and enamels of brilliant
  colours, but there was no staircase. Nothing but a single shaft for a lift
  went up the centre between the solid walls, and the approach to it was
  guarded by heavy, powerful men like plain-clothes policemen.</p>

  <p>'Pretty elaborate protection, I know,' said Wain. 'Maybe it makes you
  smile a little, Father Brown, to find Merton has to live in a fortress like
  this without even a tree in the garden for anyone to hide behind. But you
  don't know what sort of proposition we're up against in this country. And
  perhaps you don't know just what the name of Brander Merton means. He's a
  quiet-looking man enough, and anybody might pass him in the street; not that
  they get much chance nowadays, for he can only go out now and then in a
  closed car. But if anything happened to Brander Merton there'd be earthquakes
  from Alaska to the Cannibal Islands. I fancy there was never a king or
  emperor who had such power over the nations as he has. After all, I suppose
  if you'd been asked to visit the tsar, or the king of England, you'd have had
  the curiosity to go. You mayn't care much for tsars or millionaires; but it
  just means that power like that is always interesting. And I hope it's not
  against your principles to visit a modern sort of emperor like Merton.'</p>

  <p>'Not at all,' said Father Brown, quietly. 'It is my duty to visit
  prisoners and all miserable men in captivity.'</p>

  <p>There was a silence, and the young man frowned with a strange and almost
  shifty look on his lean face. Then he said, abruptly:</p>

  <p>'Well, you've got to remember it isn't only common crooks or the Black
  Hand that's against him. This Daniel Doom is pretty much like the devil. Look
  how he dropped Trant in his own gardens and Horder outside his house, and got
  away with it.'</p>

  <p>The top floor of the mansion, inside the enormously thick walls, consisted
  of two rooms; an outer room which they entered, and an inner room that was
  the great millionaire's sanctum. They entered the outer room just as two
  other visitors were coming out of the inner one. One was hailed by Peter Wain
  as his uncle&mdash;a small but very stalwart and active man with a shaven
  head that looked bald, and a brown face that looked almost too brown to have
  ever been white. This was old Crake, commonly called Hickory Crake in
  reminiscence of the more famous Old Hickory, because of his fame in the last
  Red Indian wars. His companion was a singular contrast&mdash;a very dapper
  gentleman with dark hair like a black varnish and a broad, black ribbon to
  his monocle: Barnard Blake, who was old Merton's lawyer and had been
  discussing with the partners the business of the firm. The four men met in
  the middle of the outer room and paused for a little polite conversation, in
  the act of respectively going and coming. And through all goings and comings
  another figure sat at the back of the room near the inner door, massive and
  motionless in the half-light from the inner window; a man with a Negro face
  and enormous shoulders. This was what the humorous self-criticism of
  America playfully calls the Bad Man; whom his friends might call a bodyguard
  and his enemies a bravo.</p>

  <p>This man never moved or stirred to greet anybody; but the sight of him in
  the outer room seemed to move Peter Wain to his first nervous query.</p>

  <p>'Is anybody with the chief?' he asked.</p>

  <p>'Don't get rattled, Peter,' chuckled his uncle. 'Wilton the secretary is
  with him, and I hope that's enough for anybody. I don't believe Wilton ever
  sleeps for watching Merton. He is better than twenty bodyguards. And he's
  quick and quiet as an Indian.'</p>

  <p>'Well, you ought to know,' said his nephew, laughing. 'I remember the Red
  Indian tricks you used to teach me when I was a boy and liked to read Red
  Indian stories. But in my Red Indian stories Red Indians seemed always to
  have the worst of it.'</p>

  <p>'They didn't in real life,' said the old frontiersman grimly.</p>

  <p>'Indeed?' inquired the bland Mr Blake. 'I should have thought they could
  do very little against our firearms.'</p>

  <p>'I've seen an Indian stand under a hundred guns with nothing but a little
  scalping-knife and kill a white man standing on the top of a fort,' said
  Crake.</p>

  <p>'Why, what did he do with it?' asked the other.</p>

  <p>'Threw it,' replied Crake, 'threw it in a flash before a shot could be
  fired. I don't know where he learnt the trick.'</p>

  <p>'Well, I hope you didn't learn it,' said his nephew, laughing.</p>

  <p>'It seems to me,' said Father Brown, thoughtfully, 'that the story might
  have a moral.'</p>

  <p>While they were speaking Mr Wilton, the secretary, had come out of the
  inner room and stood waiting; a pale, fair-haired man with a square chin and
  steady eyes with a look like a dog's; it was not difficult to believe that he
  had the single-eye of a watchdog.</p>

  <p>He only said, 'Mr Merton can see you in about ten minutes,' but it served
  for a signal to break up the gossiping group. Old Crake said he must be off,
  and his nephew went out with him and his legal companion, leaving Father
  Brown for the moment alone with his secretary; for the negroid giant at the
  other end of the room could hardly be felt as if he were human or alive; he
  sat so motionless with his broad back to them, staring towards the inner
  room.</p>

  <p>'Arrangements rather elaborate here, I'm afraid,' said the secretary.
  'You've probably heard all about this Daniel Doom, and why it isn't safe to
  leave the boss very much alone.'</p>

  <p>'But he is alone just now, isn't he?' said Father Brown.</p>

  <p>The secretary looked at him with grave, grey eyes. 'For fifteen minutes,'
  he said. 'For fifteen minutes out of the twenty-four hours. That is all the
  real solitude he has; and that he insists on, for a pretty remarkable
  reason.'</p>

  <p>'And what is the reason?' inquired the visitor. Wilton, the secretary,
  continued his steady gaze, but his mouth, that had been merely grave, became
  grim.</p>

  <p>'The Coptic Cup,' he said. 'Perhaps you've forgotten the Coptic Cup; but
  he hasn't forgotten that or anything else. He doesn't trust any of us about
  the Coptic Cup. It's locked up somewhere and somehow in that room so that
  only he can find it; and he won't take it out till we're all out of the way.
  So we have to risk that quarter of an hour while he sits and worships it; I
  reckon it's the only worshipping he does. Not that there's any risk really;
  for I've turned all this place into a trap I don't believe the devil himself
  could get into&mdash;or at any rate, get out of. If this infernal Daniel Doom
  pays us a visit, he'll stay to dinner and a good bit later, by God! I sit
  here on hot bricks for the fifteen minutes, and the instant I heard a shot or
  a sound of struggle I'd press this button and an electrocuting current would
  run in a ring round that garden wall, so that it 'ud be death to cross or
  climb it. Of course, there couldn't be a shot, for this is the only way in;
  and the only window he sits at is away up on the top of a tower as smooth as
  a greasy pole. But, anyhow, we're all armed here, of course; and if Doom did
  get into that room he'd be dead before he got out.'</p>

  <p>Father Brown was blinking at the carpet in a brown study. Then he said
  suddenly, with something like a jerk: 'I hope you won't mind my mentioning
  it, but a kind of a notion came into my head just this minute. It's about
  you.'</p>

  <p>'Indeed,' remarked Wilton, 'and what about me?'</p>

  <p>'I think you are a man of one idea,' said Father Brown, 'and you will
  forgive me for saying that it seems to be even more the idea of catching
  Daniel Doom than of defending Brander Merton.'</p>

  <p>Wilton started a little and continued to stare at his companion; then very
  slowly his grim mouth took on a rather curious smile. 'How did you&mdash;what
  makes you think that?' he asked.</p>

  <p>'You said that if you heard a shot you could instantly electrocute the
  escaping enemy,' remarked the priest. 'I suppose it occurred to you that the
  shot might be fatal to your employer before the shock was fatal to his foe. I
  don't mean that you wouldn't protect Mr Merton if you could, but it seems to
  come rather second in your thoughts. The arrangements are very elaborate, as
  you say, and you seem to have elaborated them. But they seem even more
  designed to catch a murderer than to save a man.'</p>

  <p>'Father Brown,' said the secretary, who had recovered his quiet tone,
  'you're very smart, but there's something more to you than smartness. Somehow
  you're the sort of man to whom one wants to tell the truth; and besides,
  you'll probably hear it, anyhow, for in one way it's a joke against me
  already. They all say I'm a monomaniac about running down this big crook, and
  perhaps I am. But I'll tell you one thing that none of them know. My full
  name is John Wilton Border.' Father Brown nodded as if he were completely
  enlightened, but the other went on.</p>

  <p>'This fellow who calls himself Doom killed my father and uncle and ruined
  my mother. When Merton wanted a secretary I took the job, because I thought
  that where the cup was the criminal might sooner or later be. But I didn't
  know who the criminal was and could only wait for him; and I meant to serve
  Merton faithfully.'</p>

  <p>'I understand,' said Father Brown gently; 'and, by the way, isn't it time
  that we attended on him?'</p>

  <p>'Why, yes,' answered Wilton, again starting a little out of his brooding
  so that the priest concluded that his vindictive mania had again absorbed him
  for a moment.' Go in now by all means.'</p>

  <p>Father Brown walked straight into the inner room. No sound of greetings
  followed, but only a dead silence; and a moment after the priest reappeared
  in the doorway.</p>

  <p>At the same moment the silent bodyguard sitting near the door moved
  suddenly; and it was as if a huge piece of furniture had come to life. It
  seemed as though something in the very attitude of the priest had been a
  signal; for his head was against the light from the inner window and his face
  was in shadow.</p>

  <p>'I suppose you will press that button,' he said with a sort of sigh.</p>

  <p>Wilton seemed to awake from his savage brooding with a bound and leapt up
  with a catch in his voice.</p>

  <p>'There was no shot,' he cried.</p>

  <p>'Well,' said Father Brown, 'it depends what you mean by a shot.'</p>

  <p>Wilton rushed forward, and they plunged into the inner room together. It
  was a comparatively small room and simply though elegantly furnished.
  Opposite to them one wide window stood open, over-looking the garden and the
  wooded plain. Close up against the window stood a chair and a small table, as
  if the captive desired as much air and light as was allowed him during his
  brief luxury of loneliness.</p>

  <p>On the little table under the window stood the Coptic Cup; its owner had
  evidently been looking at it in the best light. It was well worth looking at,
  for that white and brilliant daylight turned its precious stones to
  many-coloured flames so that it might have been a model of the Holy Grail. It
  was well worth looking at; but Brander Merton was not looking at it. For his
  head had fallen back over his chair, his mane of white hair hanging towards
  the floor, and his spike of grizzled beard thrust up towards the ceiling, and
  out of his throat stood a long, brown-painted arrow with red leathers at
  the other end.</p>

  <p>'A silent shot,' said Father Brown, in a low voice; 'I was just wondering
  about those new inventions for silencing firearms. But this is a very old
  invention, and quite as silent.'</p>

  <p>Then, after a moment, he added: 'I'm afraid he is dead. What are you going
  to do?'</p>

  <p>The pale secretary roused himself with abrupt resolution. 'I'm going to
  press that button, of course,' he said, 'and if that doesn't do for Daniel
  Doom, I'm going to hunt him through the world till I find him.'</p>

  <p>'Take care it doesn't do for any of our friends,' observed Father Brown;
  'they can hardly be far off; we'd better call them.'</p>

  <p>'That lot know all about the wall,' answered Wilton. 'None of them will
  try to climb it, unless one of them ... is in a great hurry.'</p>

  <p>Father Brown went to the window by which the arrow had evidently entered
  and looked out. The garden, with its flat flower-beds, lay far below like a
  delicately coloured map of the world. The whole vista seemed so vast and
  empty, the tower seemed set so far up in the sky that as he stared out a
  strange phrase came back to his memory.</p>

  <p>'A bolt from the blue,' he said. 'What was that somebody said about a bolt
  from the blue and death coming out of the sky? Look how far away everything
  looks; it seems extraordinary that an arrow could come so far, unless it were
  an arrow from heaven.'</p>

  <p>Wilton had returned, but did not reply, and the priest went on as in
  soliloquy. 'One thinks of aviation. We must ask young Wain ... about
  aviation.'</p>

  <p>'There's a lot of it round here,' said the secretary.</p>

  <p>'Case of very old or very new weapons,' observed Father Brown. 'Some would
  be quite familiar to his old uncle, I suppose; we must ask him about arrows.
  This looks rather like a Red Indian arrow. I don't know where the Red Indian
  shot it from; but you remember the story the old man told. I said it had a
  moral.'</p>

  <p>'If it had a moral,' said Wilton warmly, 'it was only that a real 'Red
  Indian might shoot a thing farther than you'd fancy. It's nonsense your
  suggesting a parallel.'</p>

  <p>'I don't think you've got the moral quite right,' said Father Brown.</p>

  <p>Although the little priest appeared to melt into the millions of New York
  next day, without any apparent attempt to be anything but a number in a
  numbered street, he was, in fact, unobtrusively busy for the next fortnight
  with the commission that had been given him, for he was filled with profound
  fear about a possible miscarriage of justice. Without having any particular
  air of singling them out from his other new acquaintances, he found it easy
  to fall into talk with the two or three men recently involved in the mystery;
  and with old Hickory Crake especially he had a curious and interesting
  conversation. It took place on a seat in Central Park, where the veteran sat
  with his bony hands and hatchet face resting on the oddly-shaped head of a
  walking-stick of dark red wood, possibly modelled on a tomahawk.</p>

  <p>'Well, it may be a long shot,' he said, wagging his head, 'but I wouldn't
  advise you to be too positive about how far an Indian arrow could go. I've
  known some bow-shots that seemed to go straighter than any bullets, and hit
  the mark to amazement, considering how long they had been travelling. Of
  course, you practically never hear now of a Red Indian with a bow and arrows,
  still less of a Red Indian hanging about here. But if by any chance there
  were one of the old Indian marksmen, with one of the old Indian bows, hiding
  in those trees hundreds of yards beyond the Merton outer wall&mdash;why, then
  I wouldn't put it past the noble savage to be able to send an arrow over the
  wall and into the top window of Merton's house; no, nor into Merton, either.
  I've seen things quite as wonderful as that done in the old days.'</p>

  <p>'No doubt,' said the priest, 'you have done things quite as wonderful, as
  well as seen them.'</p>

  <p>Old Crake chuckled, and then said gruffly: 'Oh, that's all ancient
  history.'</p>

  <p>'Some people have a way of studying ancient history,' the priest said. 'I
  suppose we may take it there is nothing in your old record In make people
  talk unpleasantly about this affair.'</p>

  <p>'What do you mean?' demanded Crake, his eyes shifting sharply for the
  first time, in his red, wooden face, that was rather like I he head of a
  tomahawk.</p>

  <p>'Well, since you were so well acquainted with all the arts and crafts of
  the Redskin&mdash;' began Father Brown slowly.</p>

  <p>Crake had had a hunched and almost shrunken appearance as he sat with his
  chin propped on its queer-shaped crutch. But the next instant he stood erect
  in the path like a fighting bravo with the crutch clutched like a cudgel.</p>

  <p>'What?' he cried&mdash;in something like a raucous screech&mdash;'what the
  hell! Are you standing up to me to tell me I might happen to have murdered my
  own brother-in-law?'</p>

  <p>From a dozen seats dotted about the path people looked to-wards the
  disputants, as they stood facing each other in the middle of the path, the
  bald-headed energetic little man brandishing his outlandish stick like a
  club, and the black, dumpy figure of the little cleric looking at him without
  moving a muscle, save for his hinging eyelids. For a moment it looked as if
  the black, dumpy figure would be knocked on the head, and laid out with true
  Red Indian promptitude and dispatch; and the large form of an Irish policeman
  could be seen heaving up in the distance and bearing down on the group. But
  the priest only said, quite placidly, like one answering an ordinary
  query:</p>

  <p>'I have formed certain conclusions about it, but I do not think I will
  mention them till I make my report.'</p>

  <p>Whether under the influence of the footsteps of the policeman or of the
  eyes of the priest, old Hickory tucked his stick under his arm and put his
  hat on again, grunting. The priest bade him a placid good morning, and passed
  in an unhurried fashion out of the park, making his way to the lounge of the
  hotel where he knew that young Wain was to be found. The young man sprang up
  with a greeting; he looked even more haggard and harassed than before, as if
  some worry were eating him away; and the priest had a suspicion that his
  young friend had recently been engaged, with only too conspicuous success, in
  evading the last Amendment to the American Constitution. But at the first
  word about his hobby or favourite science he was vigilant and concentrated
  enough. For Father Brown had asked, in an idle and conversational fashion,
  whether much flying was done in that district, and had told how he had at
  first mistaken Mr Merton's circular wall for an aerodrome.</p>

  <p>'It's a wonder you didn't see any while we were there,' answered Captain
  Wain. 'Sometimes they're as thick as flies; that open plain is a great place
  for them, and I shouldn't wonder if it were the chief breeding-ground, so
  to speak, for my sort of birds in the future. I've flown a good deal there
  myself, of course, and I know most of the fellows about here who flew in the
  war; but there are a whole lot of people taking to it out there now whom I
  never heard of in my life. I suppose it will be like motoring soon, and every
  man in the States will have one.'</p>

  <p>'Being endowed by his Creator,' said Father Brown with a smile, 'with the
  right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of motoring&mdash;not to mention
  aviation. So I suppose we may take it that one strange aeroplane passing over
  that house, at certain times, wouldn't be noticed much.'</p>

  <p>'No,' replied the young man; 'I don't suppose it would.'</p>

  <p>'Or even if the man were known,' went on the other, 'I suppose he might
  get hold of a machine that wouldn't be recognized as his. If you, for
  instance, flew in the ordinary way, Mr Merton and his friends might recognize
  the rig-out, perhaps; but you might pass pretty near that window on a
  different pattern of plane, or whatever you call it; near enough for
  practical purposes.'</p>

  <p>'Well, yes,' began the young man, almost automatically, and then ceased,
  and remained staring at the cleric with an open mouth and eyes standing out
  of his head.</p>

  <p>'My God!' he said, in a low voice;' my God!'</p>

  <p>Then he rose from the lounge seat, pale and shaking from head to foot and
  still staring at the priest.</p>

  <p>'Are you mad?' he said;' are you raving mad?'</p>

  <p>There was a silence and then he spoke again in a swift hissing fashion.
  'You positively come here to suggest&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'No; only to collect suggestions,' said Father Brown, rising. 'I may have
  formed some conclusions provisionally, but I had better reserve them for the
  present.'</p>

  <p>And then saluting the other with the same stiff civility, he passed out of
  the hotel to continue his curious peregrinations.</p>

  <p>By the dusk of that day they had led him down the dingy streets and steps
  that straggled and tumbled towards the river in the the oldest and most
  irregular part of the city. Immediately under the coloured lantern that
  marked the entrance to a rather low Chinese restaurant he encountered a
  figure he had seen before, though by no means presenting itself to the eye as
  he had seen it.</p>

  <p>Mr Norman Drage still confronted the world grimly behind his great
  goggles, which seemed somehow to cover his face like a dark musk of glass.
  But except for the goggles, his appearance had undergone a strange
  transformation in the month that had elapsed since the murder. He had then,
  as Father Brown had noted, been dressed up to the nines&mdash;up to that
point,
  indeed, where there begins to be too fine a distinction between the dandy and
  the dummy outside a tailor's shop. But now all those externals were
  mysteriously altered for the worse; as if the tailor's dummy had been turned
  into a scarecrow. His top hat still existed, but it was battered and shabby;
  his clothes were dilapidated; his watch-chain and minor ornaments were gone.
  Father Brown, however, addressed him as if they had met yesterday, and made
  no demur to silting down with him on a bench in the cheap eating-house
  whither he was bound. It was not he, however, who began the conversation.</p>

  <p>'Well?' growled Drage, 'and have you succeeded in avenging your holy and
  sainted millionaire? We know all millionaires are holy and sainted; you can
  find it all in the papers next day, about how they lived by the light of the
  Family Bible they read at their mother's knee. Gee! if they'd only read out
  some of the things there are in the Family Bible, the mother might have been
  startled some. And the millionaire, too, I reckon. The old Book's full of a
  lot of grand fierce old notions they don't grow nowadays; sort of wisdom of
  the Stone Age and buried under the Pyramids. Suppose somebody had flung old
  man Merton from the top of that tower of his, and let him be eaten by dogs at
  the bottom, it would be no worse than what happened to Jezebel. Wasn't Agag
  hacked into little pieces, for all he went walking delicately? Merton walked
  delicately all his life, damn him&mdash;until he got too delicate to walk at
  all. But the shaft of the Lord found him out, as it might have done in the
  old Book, and struck him dead on the top of his tower to be a spectacle to
  the people.</p>

  <p>'The shaft was material, at least,' said his companion.</p>

  <p>'The Pyramids are mighty material, and they hold down the dead kings all
  right,' grinned the man in the goggles. 'I think there's a lot to be said for
  these old material religions. There's old carvings that have lasted for
  thousands of years, showing their gods and emperors with bended bows; with
  hands that look as if they could really bend bows of stone. Material,
  perhaps&mdash;but what materials! Don't you sometimes stand staring at those
  old Eastern patterns and things, till you have a hunch that old Lord God is
  still driving like a dark Apollo, and shooting black rays of death?'</p>

  <p>'If he is,' replied Father Brown, 'I might call him by another name. But I
  doubt whether Merton died by a dark ray or even a stone arrow.'</p>

  <p>'I guess you think he's St Sebastian,' sneered Drage, 'killed with an
  arrow. A millionaire must be a martyr. How do you know he didn't deserve it?
  You don't know much about your millionaire, I fancy. Well, let me tell you he
  deserved it a hundred times over.'</p>

  <p>'Well,' asked Father Brown gently, 'why didn't you murder him?'</p>

  <p>'You want to know why I didn't?' said the other, staring. 'Well, you're a
  nice sort of clergyman.'</p>

  <p>'Not at all,' said the other, as if waving away a compliment.</p>

  <p>'I suppose it's your way of saying I did,' snarled Drage. 'Well, prove it,
  that's all. As for him, I reckon he was no loss.'</p>

  <p>'Yes, he was,' said Father Brown, sharply. 'He was a loss to you. That's
  why you didn't kill him.'</p>

  <p>And he walked out of the room, leaving the man in goggles gaping after
  him.</p>

  <p>It was nearly a month later that Father Brown revisited the house where
  the third millionaire had suffered from the vendetta of Daniel Doom. A sort
  of council was held of the persons most interested. Old Crake sat at the head
  of the table with his nephew at his right hand, the lawyer on his left; the
  big man with the African features, whose name appeared to be Harris, was
  ponderously present, if only as a material witness; a red-haired, sharp-nosed
  individual addressed as Dixon seemed to be the representative of
  Pinkerton's or some such private agency; and Father Brown slipped
  unobtrusively into an empty seat beside him.</p>

  <p>Every newspaper in the world was full of the catastrophe of the colossus
  of finance, of the great organizer of the Big Business that bestrides the
  modern world; but from the tiny group that had been nearest to him at the
  very instant of his death very little could be learned. The uncle, nephew,
  and attendant solicitor declared they were well outside the outer wall before
  the alarm was raised; and inquiries of the official guardians at both
  barriers brought answers that were rather confused, but on the whole
  confirmatory. Only one other complication seemed to call for consideration.
  It seemed that round about the time of the death, before or after, a stranger
  had been found hanging mysteriously round the entrance and asking to see Mr
  Merton. The servants had some difficulty in understanding what he meant, for
  his language was very obscure; but it was afterwards considered to be also
  very suspicious, since he had said something about a wicked man being
  destroyed by a word out of the sky.</p>

  <p>Peter Wain leaned forward, the eyes bright in his haggard face, and
  said:</p>

  <p>'I'll bet on that, anyhow. Norman Drage.'</p>

  <p>'And who in the world is Norman Drage?' asked his uncle.</p>

  <p>'That's what I want to know,' replied the young man. 'I practically asked
  him, but he has got a wonderful trick of twisting every straight question
  crooked; it's like lunging at a fencer. He hooked on to me with hints about
  the flying-ship of the future; but I never trusted him much.'</p>

  <p>'But what sort of a man is he?' asked Crake.</p>

  <p>'He's a mystagogue,' said Father Brown, with innocent promptitude. 'There
  are quite a lot of them about; the sort of men about town who hint to you in
  Paris cafes and cabarets that they've lifted the veil of Isis or know the
  secret of Stonehenge. In a case like this they're sure to have some sort of
  mystical explanations.'</p>

  <p>The smooth, dark head of Mr Barnard Blake, the lawyer, was inclined
  politely towards the speaker, but his smile was faintly hostile.</p>

  <p>'I should hardly have thought, sir,' he said, 'that you had any quarrel
  with mystical explanations.'</p>

  <p>'On the contrary,' replied Father Brown, blinking amiably at him. 'That's
  just why I can quarrel with 'em. Any sham lawyer could bamboozle me, but he
  couldn't bamboozle you; because you're a lawyer yourself. Any fool could
  dress up as a Red Indian and I'd swallow him whole as the only original
  Hiawatha; but Mr Crake would see through him at once. A swindler could
  pretend to me that he knew all about aeroplanes, but not to Captain Wain. And
  it's just the same with the other, don't you see? It's just because I have
  picked up a little about mystics that I have no use for mystagogues. Real
  mystics don't hide mysteries, they reveal them. They set a thing up in broad
  daylight, and when you've seen it it's still a mystery. But the mystagogues
  hide a thing in darkness and secrecy, and when you find it, it's a platitude.
  But in the case of Drage, I admit he had also another and more practical
  notion in talking about fire from heaven or bolts from the blue.'</p>

  <p>'And what was his notion?' asked Wain. 'I think it wants watching whatever
  it is.'</p>

  <p>'Well,' replied the priest, slowly, 'he wanted us to think the murders
  were miracles because . . . well, because he knew they weren't.'</p>

  <p>'Ah,' said Wain, with a sort of hiss, 'I was waiting for that. In plain
  words, he is the criminal.'</p>

  <p>'In plain words, he is the criminal who didn't commit the crime,' answered
  Father Brown calmly.</p>

  <p>'Is that your conception of plain words?' inquired Blake politely.</p>

  <p>'You'll be saying I'm the mystagogue now,' said Father Brown somewhat
  abashed, but with a broad smile, 'but it was really quite accidental. Drage
  didn't commit the crime&mdash;I mean this crime. His only crime was
  blackmailing somebody, and he hung about here to do it; but he wasn't likely
  to want the secret to be public property or the whole business to be cut
  short by death. We can talk about him afterwards. Just at the moment, I only
  want him cleared out of the way.'</p>

  <p>'Out of the way of what?' asked the other.</p>

  <p>'Out of the way of the truth,' replied the priest, looking at him
  tranquilly, with level eyelids.</p>

  <p>'Do you mean,' faltered the other, 'that you know the truth?'</p>

  <p>'I rather think so,' said Father Brown modestly.</p>

  <p>There was an abrupt silence, after which Crake cried out suddenly and
  irrelevantly in a rasping voice:</p>

  <p>'Why, where is that secretary fellow? Wilton! He ought to be here.'</p>

  <p>'I am in communication with Mr Wilton,' said Father Brown gravely; 'in
  fact, I asked him to ring me up here in a few minutes from now. I may say
  that we've worked the thing out together, in a manner of speaking.'</p>

  <p>'If you're working together, I suppose it's all right,' grumbled Crake. 'I
  know he was always a sort of bloodhound on the trail of his vanishing crook,
  so perhaps it was well to hunt in couples with him. But if you know the truth
  about this, where the devil did you get it from?'</p>

  <p>'I got it from you,' answered the priest, quietly, and continued to gaze
  mildly at the glaring veteran.' I mean I made the first guess from a hint in
  a story of yours about an Indian who threw a knife and hit a man on the top
  of a fortress.'</p>

  <p>'You've said that several times,' said Wain, with a puzzled air; 'but I
  can't see any inference, except that this murderer threw an arrow and hit a
  man on the top of a house very like a fortress. But of course the arrow
  wasn't thrown but shot, and would go much further. Certainly it went
  uncommonly far; but I don't see how it brings us any farther.'</p>

  <p>'I'm afraid you missed the point of the story,' said Father Brown. 'It
  isn't that if one thing cap go far another can go farther. It is that the
  wrong use of a tool can cut both ways. The men on Crake's fort thought of a
  knife as a thing for a hand-to-hand fight and forgot that it could be a
  missile like a javelin. Some other people I know thought of a thing as a
  missile like a javelin and forgot that, after all, it could be used
  hand-to-hand as a spear. In short, the moral of the story is that since a
  dagger can be turned into an arrow, so can an arrow be turned into a
  dagger.'</p>

  <p>They were all looking at him now; but he continued in the same casual and
  unconscious tone: 'Naturally we wondered and worried a good deal about who
  shot that arrow through the window and whether it came from far away, and so
  on. But the truth is that nobody shot the arrow at all. It never came in at
  the window at all.'</p>

  <p>'Then how did it come there?' asked the swarthy lawyer, with a rather
  lowering face.</p>

  <p>'Somebody brought it with him, I suppose,' said Father Brown; 'it wouldn't
  be hard to carry or conceal. Somebody had it in his hand as he stood with
  Merton in Merton's own room. Somebody thrust it into Merton's throat like a
  poignard, and then had the highly intelligent idea of placing the whole thing
  at such a place and angle that we all assumed in a flash that it had flown in
  at the window like a bird.'</p>

  <p>'Somebody,' said old Crake, in a voice as heavy as stone.</p>

  <p>The telephone bell rang with a strident and horrible clamour of
  insistence. It was in the adjoining room, and Father Brown had darted there
  before anybody else could move.</p>

  <p>'What the devil is it all about?' cried Peter Wain, who seemed all shaken
  and distracted.</p>

  <p>'He said he expected to be rung up by Wilton, the secretary,' replied his
  uncle in the same dead voice.</p>

  <p>'I suppose it is Wilton?' observed the lawyer, like one speaking to fill
  up a silence. But nobody answered the question until Father Brown reappeared
  suddenly and silently in the room, bringing the answer.</p>

  <p>'Gentlemen,' he said, when he had resumed his seat,' it was you who asked
  me to look into the truth about this puzzle; and having found the truth, I
  must tell it, without any pretence of softening the shock. I'm afraid anybody
  who pokes his nose into things like this can't afford to be a respecter of
  persons.'</p>

  <p>'I suppose,' said Crake, breaking the silence that followed, 'that means
  that some of us are accused, or suspected.'</p>

  <p>'All of us are suspected,' answered Father Brown. 'I may be suspected
  myself, for I found the body.'</p>

  <p>'Of course we're suspected,' snapped Wain. 'Father Brown kindly explained
  to me how I could have besieged the tower in a flying-machine.'</p>

  <p>'No,' replied the priest, with a smile; 'you described to me how you could
  have done it. That was just the interesting part of it.'</p>

  <p>'He seemed to think it likely,' growled Crake, 'that I killed him myself
  with a Red Indian arrow.'</p>

  <p>'I thought it most unlikely,' said Father Brown, making rather a wry face.
  I'm sorry if I did wrong, but I couldn't think of any other way of testing
  the matter. I can hardly think of anything more improbable than the notion
  that Captain Wain went careering in a huge machine past the window, at the
  very moment of the murder, and nobody noticed it; unless, perhaps, it were
  the notion that a respectable old gentleman should play at Red Indians with a
  bow and arrow behind the bushes, to kill somebody he could have killed in
  twenty much simpler ways. But I had to find out if they had had anything to
  do with it; and so I had to accuse them in order to prove their
  innocence.'</p>

  <p>'And how have you proved their innocence?' asked Blake the lawyer, leaning
  forward eagerly.</p>

  <p>'Only by the agitation they showed when they were accused,' answered the
  other.</p>

  <p>'What do you mean, exactly?'</p>

  <p>'If you will permit me to say so,' remarked Father Brown, composedly
  enough, 'I did undoubtedly think it my duty to suspect them and everybody
  else. I did suspect Mr Crake and I did suspect Captain Wain, in the sense
  that I considered the possibility or probability of their guilt. I told them
  I had formed conclusions about it; and I will now tell them what those
  conclusions were. I was sure they were innocent, because of the manner and
  the moment in which they passed from unconsciousness to indignation. So long
  as they never thought they were accused, they went on giving me materials to
  support the accusation. They practically explained to me how they might have
  committed the crime. Then they suddenly realized with a shock and a shout of
  rage that they were accused; they realized it long after they might well have
  expected to be accused, but long before I had accused them. Now no guilty
  person could possibly do that. He might be snappy and suspicious from the
  first; or he might simulate unconsciousness and innocence up to the end. But
  he wouldn't begin by making things worse for himself and then give a great
  jump and begin furiously denying the notion he had himself helped to suggest.
  That could only come by his having really failed to realize what he was
  suggesting. The self-consciousness of a murderer would always be at least
  morbidly vivid enough to prevent him first forgetting his relation with the
  thing and then remembering to deny it. So I ruled you both out and others for
  other reasons I needn't discuss now. For instance, there was the
secretary&mdash;
</p>

  <p>'But I'm not talking about that just now. Look here, I've just heard from
  Wilton on the phone, and he's given me permission to tell you some rather
  serious news. Now I suppose you all know by this time who Wilton was, and
  what he was after.'</p>

  <p>'I know he was after Daniel Doom and wouldn't be happy till he got him,'
  answered Peter Wain; 'and I've heard the story that he's the son of old
  Horder, and that's why he's the avenger of blood. Anyhow, he's certainly
  looking for the man called Doom.'</p>

  <p>'Well,' said Father Brown, 'he has found him.'</p>

  <p>Peter Wain sprang to his feet in excitement.</p>

  <p>'The murderer!' he cried. 'Is the murderer in the lock-up already?'</p>

  <p>'No,' said Father Brown, gravely; 'I said the news was serious, and it's
  more serious than that. I'm afraid poor Wilton has taken a terrible
  responsibility. I'm afraid he's going to put a terrible responsibility on us.
  He hunted the criminal down, and just when he had him cornered at
  last&mdash;well, he has taken the law into his own hands.'</p>

  <p>'You mean that Daniel Doom&mdash;' began the lawyer.</p>

  <p>'I mean that Daniel Doom is dead,' said the priest. 'There was some sort
  of wild struggle, and Wilton killed him.'</p>

  <p>'Serve him right,' growled Mr Hickory Crake.</p>

  <p>'Can't blame Wilton for downing a crook like that, especially considering
  the feud,' assented Wain; 'it was like stepping on a viper.'</p>

  <p>'I don't agree with you,' said Father Brown. 'I suppose we all talk
  romantic stuff at random in defence of lynching and lawlessness; but I have a
  suspicion that if we lose our laws and liberties we shall regret it. Besides,
  it seems to me illogical to say there is something to be said for Wilton
  committing murder, without even inquiring whether there was anything to be
  said for Doom committing it. I rather doubt whether Doom was merely a vulgar
  assassin; he may have been a sort of outlaw with a mania about the cup,
  demanding it with threats and only killing after a struggle; both victims
  were thrown down just outside their houses. The objection to Wilton's way of
  doing it is that we shall never hear Doom's side of the case.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, I've no patience with all this sentimental whitewashing of worthless,
  murderous blackguards,' cried Wain, heatedly. 'If Wilton croaked the criminal
  he did a jolly good day's work, and there's an end of it.'</p>

  <p>'Quite so, quite so,' said his uncle, nodding vigorously.</p>

  <p>Father Brown's face had a yet heavier gravity as he looked slowly round
  the semicircle effaces. 'Is that really what you all think?' he asked. Even
  as he did so he realized that he was an Englishman and an exile. He realized
  that he was among foreigners, even if he was among friends. Around that ring
  of foreigners ran a restless fire that was not native to his own breed; the
  fiercer spirit of the western nation that can rebel and lynch, and above all,
  combine. He knew that they had already combined.</p>

  <p>'Well,' said Father Brown, with a sigh, 'I am to understand, then, that
  you do definitely condone this unfortunate man's crime, or act of private
  justice, or whatever you call it. In that case it will not hurt him if I tell
  you a little more about it.'</p>

  <p>He rose suddenly to his feet; and though they saw no meaning in his
  movement, it seemed in some way to change or chill the very air in the
  room.</p>

  <p>'Wilton killed Doom in a rather curious way,' he began.</p>

  <p>'How did Wilton kill him?' asked Crake, abruptly.</p>

  <p>'With an arrow,' said Father Brown.</p>

  <p>Twilight was gathering in the long room, and daylight dwindling to a gleam
  from the great window in the inner room, where the great millionaire had
  died. Almost automatically the eyes of the group turned slowly towards it,
  but as yet there was no sound. Then the voice of Crake came cracked and high
  and senile in a sort of crowing gabble.</p>

  <p>'What you mean? What you mean? Brander Merton killed by an arrow. This
  crook killed by an arrow&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'By the same arrow,' said the priest, 'and at the same moment.'</p>

  <p>Again there was a sort of strangled and yet swollen and bursting silence,
  and young Wain began: 'You mean&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'I mean that your friend Merton was Daniel Doom,' said Father Brown
  firmly;' and the only Daniel Doom you'll ever find. Your friend Merton was
  always crazy after that Coptic Cup that he used to worship like an idol every
  day; and in his wild youth he had really killed two men to get it, though I
  still think the deaths may have been in a sense accidents of the robbery.
  Anyhow, he had it; and that man Drage knew the story and was blackmailing
  him. But Wilton was after him for a very different purpose; I fancy he only
  discovered the truth when he'd got into this house. But anyhow, it was in
  this house, and in that room, that this hunt ended, and he slew the slayer of
  his father.'</p>

  <p>For a long time nobody answered. Then old Crake could be heard drumming
  with his fingers on the table and muttering:</p>

  <p>'Brander must have been mad. He must have been mad.'</p>

  <p>'But, good Lord!' burst out Peter Wain;' what are we to do? What are we to
  say? Oh, it's all quite different! What about the papers and the big business
  people? Brander Merton is a thing like the President or the Pope of
  Rome.'</p>

  <p>'I certainly think it is rather different,' began Barnard Blake, the
  lawyer, in a low voice. 'The difference involves a whole&mdash;'</p>

  <p>Father Brown struck the table so that the glasses on it rang; and they
  could almost fancy a ghostly echo from the mysterious chalice that still
  stood in the room beyond.</p>

  <p>'No!' he cried, in a voice like a pistol-shot. 'There shall be no
  difference. I gave you your chance of pitying the poor devil when you thought
  he was a common criminal. You wouldn't listen then; you were all for private
  vengeance then. You were all for letting him be butchered like a wild beast
  without a hearing or a public trial, and said he had only got his deserts.
  Very well then, if Daniel Doom has got his deserts, Brander Merton has got
  his deserts. If that was good enough for Doom, by all that is holy it is good
  enough for Merton. Take your wild justice or our dull legality; but in the
  name of Almighty God, let there be an equal lawlessness or an equal law.'</p>

  <p>Nobody answered except the lawyer, and he answered with something like a
  snarl: 'What will the police say if we tell them we mean to condone a
  crime?'</p>

  <p>'What will they say if I tell them you did condone it?' replied Father
  Brown. 'Your respect for the law comes rather late, Mr Barnard Blake.'</p>

  <p>After a pause he resumed in a milder tone: 'I, for one, am ready to tell
  the truth if the proper authorities ask me; and the rest of you can do as you
  like. But as a fact, it will make very little difference. Wilton only rang me
  up to tell me that I was now free to lay his confession before you; for when
  you heard it, he would be beyond pursuit.'</p>

  <p>He walked slowly into the inner room and stood there by the little table
  beside which the millionaire had died. The Coptic Cup still stood in the same
  place, and he remained there for a space staring at its cluster of all the
  colours of the rainbow, and beyond it into a blue abyss of sky.</p>

  <h2><a id="story3"
     name="story3">III.&mdash;THE ORACLE OF THE DOG</a></h2>

<h3>First published in <i>Nash's Magazine</i>, Dec 1923</h3>

  <p class="first">'YES,' said Father Brown, 'I always like a dog, so long as
  he isn't spelt backwards.'</p>

  <p>Those who are quick in talking are not always quick in listening.
  Sometimes even their brilliancy produces a sort of stupidity. Father Brown's
  friend and companion was a young man with a stream of ideas and stories, an
  enthusiastic young man named Fiennes, with eager blue eyes and blond hair
  that seemed to be brushed back, not merely with a hair-brush but with the
  wind of the world as be rushed through it. But he stopped in the torrent of
  his talk in a momentary bewilderment before he saw the priest's very simple
  meaning.</p>

  <p>'You mean that people make too much of them?' he said. 'Well, I don't
  know. They're marvellous creatures. Sometimes I think they know a lot more
  than we do.'</p>

  <p>Father Brown said nothing, but continued to stroke the head of the big
  retriever in a half-abstracted but apparently soothing fashion.</p>

  <p>'Why,' said Fiennes, warming again to his monologue, 'there was a dog in
  the case I've come to see you about: what they call the 'Invisible Murder
  Case', you know. It's a strange story, but from my point of view the dog is
  about the strangest thing in it. Of course, there's the mystery of the crime
  itself, and how old Druce can have been killed by somebody else when he was
  all alone in the summer-house&mdash;'</p>

  <p>The hand stroking the dog stopped for a moment in its rhythmic movement,
  and Father Brown said calmly: 'Oh, it was a summer-house, was it?'</p>

  <p>'I thought you'd read all about it in the papers,' answered Fiennes.' Stop
  a minute; I believe I've got a cutting that will give you all the
  particulars.' He produced a strip of newspaper from his pocket and handed it
  to the priest, who began to read it, holding it close to his blinking eyes
  with one hand while the other continued its half-conscious caresses of the
  dog. It looked like the parable of a man not letting his right hand know what
  his left hand did.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Many mystery stories, about men murdered behind locked doors and windows,
  and murderers escaping without means of entrance and exit, have come true in
  the course of the extraordinary events at Cranston on the coast of Yorkshire,
  where Colonel Druce was found stabbed from behind by a dagger that has
  entirely disappeared from the scene, and apparently even from the
  neighbourhood.</p>

  <p>The summer-house in which he died was indeed accessible at one entrance,
  the ordinary doorway which looked down the central walk of the garden towards
  the house. But, by a combination of events almost to be called a coincidence,
  it appears that both the path and the entrance were watched during the
  crucial time, and there is a chain of witnesses who confirm each other. The
  summer-house stands at the extreme end of the garden, where there is no exit
  or entrance of any kind. The central garden path is a lane between two ranks
  of tall delphiniums, planted so close that any stray step off the path would
  leave its traces; and both path and plants run right up to the very mouth of
  the summer-house, so that no straying from that straight path could fail to
  be observed, and no other mode of entrance can be imagined.</p>

  <p>Patrick Floyd, secretary of the murdered man, testified that he had been
  in a position to overlook the whole garden from the time when Colonel Druce
  last appeared alive in the doorway to the time when he was found dead; as he,
  Floyd, had been on the top of a step-ladder clipping the garden hedge. Janet
  Druce, the dead man's daughter, confirmed this, saying that she had sat on
  the terrace of the house throughout that time and had seen Floyd at his work.
  Touching some part of the time, this is again supported by Donald Druce, her
  brother&mdash;who overlooked the garden&mdash;standing at his bedroom window
in
  his dressing-gown, for he had risen late. Lastly, the account is consistent
  with that given by Dr Valentine, a neighbour, who called for a time to talk
  with Miss Druce on the terrace, and by the Colonel's solicitor, Mr Aubrey
  Traill, who was apparently the last to see the murdered man
  alive&mdash;presumably with the exception of the murderer.</p>

  <p>All are agreed that the course of events was as follows: About half past
  three in the afternoon, Miss Druce went down the path to ask her father when
  he would like tea; but he said he did not want any and was waiting to see
  Traill, his lawyer, who was to be sent to him in the summer-house. The girl
  then came away and met Traill coming down the path; she directed him to her
  father and he went in as directed. About half an hour afterwards he came out
  again, the Colonel coming with him to the door and showing himself to all
  appearance in health and even high spirits. He had been somewhat annoyed
  earlier in the day by his son's irregular hours, but seemed to recover his
  temper in a perfectly normal fashion, and had been rather markedly genial in
  receiving other visitors, including two of his nephews, who came over for the
  day. But as these were out walking during the whole period of the tragedy,
  they had no evidence to give. It is said, indeed, that the Colonel was not on
  very good terms with Dr Valentine, but that gentleman only had a brief
  interview with the daughter of the house, to whom he is supposed to be paying
  serious attentions.</p>

  <p>Trail, the solicitor, says he left the Colonel entirely alone in the
  summer-house, and this is confirmed by Floyd's bird's-eye view of the garden,
  which showed nobody else passing the only entrance. Ten minutes later. Miss
  Druce again went down the garden and had not reached the end of the path when
  she saw her father, who was conspicuous by his white linen coat, lying in a
  heap on the floor. She uttered a scream which brought others to the spot, and
  on entering the place they found the Colonel lying dead beside his
  basket-chair, which was also upset. Dr Valentine, who was still in the
  immediate neighbourhood, testified that the wound was made by some sort of
  stiletto, entering under the shoulder-blade and piercing the heart. The
  police have searched the neighbourhood for such a weapon, but no trace of it
  can be found.</p>

  <p>'So Colonel Druce wore a white coat, did he?' said Father Brown as he put
  down the paper.</p>

  <p>'Trick he learnt in the tropics,' replied Fiennes, with some wonder. 'He'd
  had some queer adventures there, by his own account; and I fancy his dislike
  of Valentine was connected with the doctor coming from the tropics, too. But
  it's all an infernal puzzle. The account there is pretty accurate. I didn't
  see the tragedy, in the sense of the discovery; I was out walking with the
  young nephews and the dog&mdash;the dog I wanted to tell you about. But I saw
  the stage set for it as described; the straight lane between the blue flowers
  right up to the dark entrance, and the lawyer going down it in his blacks and
  his silk hat, and the red head of the secretary showing high above the green
  hedge as he worked on it with his shears. Nobody could have mistaken that red
  head at any distance; and if people say they saw it there all the time, you
  may be sure they did.</p>

  <p>This red-haired secretary, Floyd, is quite a character; a breathless
  bounding sort of fellow, always doing everybody's work as he was doing the
  gardener's. I think he is an American; he's certainly got the American view
  of life&mdash;what they call the view-point, bless 'em.'</p>

  <p>'What about the lawyer?' asked Father Brown. There was a silence and then
  Fiennes spoke quite slowly for him. 'Traill struck me as a singular man. In
  his fine black clothes he was almost foppish, yet you can hardly call him
  fashionable. For he wore a pair of long, luxuriant black whiskers such as
  haven't been seen since Victorian times. He had rather a fine grave face and
  a fine grave manner, but every now and then he seemed to remember to smile.
  And when he showed his white teeth he seemed to lose a little of his dignity,
  and there was something faintly fawning about him. It may have been only
  embarrassment, for he would also fidget with his cravat and his tie-pin,
  which were at once handsome and unusual, like himself. If I could think of
  anybody&mdash;but what's the good, when the whole thing's impossible? Nobody
  knows who did it. Nobody knows how it could be done. At least there's only
  one exception I'd make, and that's why I really mentioned the whole thing.
  The dog knows.'</p>

  <p>Father Brown sighed and then said absently: 'You were there as a friend of
  young Donald, weren't you? He didn't go on your walk with you?'</p>

  <p>'No,' replied Fiennes smiling. 'The young scoundrel had gone to bed that
  morning and got up that afternoon. I went with his cousins, two young
  officers from India, and our conversation was trivial enough. I remember the
  elder, whose name I think is Herbert Druce and who is an authority on
  horse-breeding, talked about nothing but a mare he had bought and the moral
  character of the man who sold her; while his brother Harry seemed to be
  brooding on his bad luck at Monte Carlo. I only mention it to show you, in
  the light of what happened on our walk, that there was nothing psychic about
  us. The dog was the only mystic in our company.'</p>

  <p>'What sort of a dog was he?' asked the priest.</p>

  <p>'Same breed as that one,' answered Fiennes. 'That's what started me off on
  the story, your saying you didn't believe in believing in a dog. He's a big
  black retriever, named Nox, and a suggestive name, too; for I think what he
  did a darker mystery than the murder. You know Druce's house and garden are
  by the sea; we walked about a mile from it along the sands and then turned
  back, going the other way. We passed a rather curious rock called the Rock of
  Fortune, famous in the neighbourhood because it's one of those examples of
  one stone barely balanced on another, so that a touch would knock it over. It
  is not really very high but the hanging outline of it makes it look a little
  wild and sinister; at least it made it look so to me, for I don't imagine my
  jolly young companions were afflicted with the picturesque. But it may be
  that I was beginning to feel an atmosphere; for just then the question arose
  of whether it was time to go back to tea, and even then I think I had a
  premonition that time counted for a good deal in the business. Neither
  Herbert Druce nor I had a watch, so we called out to his brother, who was
  some paces behind, having stopped to light his pipe under the hedge. Hence it
  happened that he shouted out the hour, which was twenty past four, in his big
  voice through the growing twilight; and somehow the loudness of it made it
  sound like the proclamation of something tremendous. His unconsciousness
  seemed to make it all the more so; but that was always the way with omens;
  and particular ticks of the clock were really very ominous things that
  afternoon. According to Dr Valentine's testimony, poor Druce had actually
  died just about half past four.</p>

  <p>'Well, they said we needn't go home for ten minutes, and we walked a
  little farther along the sands, doing nothing in particular&mdash;throwing
  stones for the dog and throwing sticks into the sea for, him to swim after.
  But to me the twilight seemed to grow oddly oppressive, and the very shadow
  of the top-heavy Rock of Fortune lay on me like a load. And then the curious
  thing happened. Nox had just brought back Herbert's walking-stick out of the
  sea and his brother had thrown his in also. The dog swam out again, but just
  about what must have been the stroke of the half-hour, he stopped swimming.
  He came back again on to the shore and stood in front of us. Then he suddenly
  threw up his head and sent up a howl or wail of woe&mdash;if ever I heard one
  in the world.</p>

  <p>''What the devil's the matter with the dog?' asked Herbert; but none of us
  could answer. There was a long silence after the brute's wailing and whining
  died away on the desolate shore; and then the silence was broken. As I live,
  it was broken by a faint and far-off shriek, like the shriek of a woman from
  beyond the hedges inland. We didn't know what it was then; but we knew
  afterwards. It was the cry the girl gave when she first saw the body of her
  father.'</p>

  <p>'You went back, I suppose,' said Father Brown patiently. 'What happened
  then?'</p>

  <p>'I'll tell you what happened then,' said Fiennes with a grim emphasis.
  'When we got back into that garden the first thing we saw was Traill, the
  lawyer; I can see him now with his black hat and black whiskers relieved
  against the perspective of the blue flowers stretching down to the
  summer-house, with the sunset and the strange outline of the Rock of Fortune
  in the distance. His face and figure were in shadow against the sunset; but I
  swear the white teeth were showing in his head and he was smiling. The moment
  Nox saw that man the dog dashed forward and stood in the middle of the path
  barking at him madly, murderously, volleying out curses that were almost
  verbal in their dreadful distinctness of hatred. And the man doubled up and
  fled, along the path between the flowers.'</p>

  <p>Father Brown sprang to his feet with a startling impatience. 'So the dog
  denounced him, did he?' he cried. 'The oracle of the dog condemned him. Did
  you see what birds were flying, and are you sure whether they were on the
  right hand or the left? Did you consult the augurs about the sacrifices?
  Surely you didn't omit to cut open the dog and examine his entrails. That is
  the sort of scientific test you heathen humanitarians seem to trust when you
  are thinking of taking away the life and honour of a man.'</p>

  <p>Fiennes sat gaping for an instant before he found breath to say: 'Why,
  what's the matter with you? What have I done now?' A sort of anxiety came
  back into the priest's eyes&mdash;the anxiety of a man who has run against a
  post in the dark and wonders for a moment whether he has hurt it.</p>

  <p>'I'm most awfully sorry,' he said with sincere distress. 'I beg your
  pardon for being so rude; pray forgive me.'</p>

  <p>Fiennes looked at him curiously. 'I sometimes think you are more of a
  mystery than any of the mysteries,' he said. 'But anyhow, if you don't
  believe in the mystery of the dog, at least you can't get over the mystery of
  the man. You can't deny that at the very moment when the beast came back from
  the sea and bellowed, his master's soul was driven out of his body by the
  blow of some unseen power that no mortal man can trace or even imagine. And
  as for the lawyer&mdash;I don't go only by the dog&mdash;there are other
  curious details, too. He struck me as a smooth, smiling, equivocal sort of
  person; and one of his tricks seemed like a sort of hint. You know the doctor
  and the police were on the spot very quickly; Valentine was brought back when
  walking away from the house, and he telephoned instantly. That, with the
  secluded house, small numbers, and enclosed space, made it pretty possible to
  search everybody who could have been near; and everybody was thoroughly
  searched for a weapon. The whole house, garden, and shore were combed for a
  weapon. The disappearance of the dagger is almost as crazy as the
  disappearance of the man.'</p>

  <p>'The disappearance of the dagger,' said Father Brown, nodding. He seemed
  to have become suddenly attentive.</p>

  <p>'Well,' continued Fiennes, 'I told you that man Traill had a trick of
  fidgeting with his tie and tie-pin&mdash;especially his tie-pin. His pin,
  like himself, was at once showy and old-fashioned. It had one of those stones
  with concentric coloured rings that look like an eye; and his own
  concentration on it got on my nerves, as if he had been a Cyclops with one
  eye in the middle of his body. But the pin was not only large but long; and
  it occurred to me that his anxiety about its adjustment was because it was
  even longer than it looked; as long as a stiletto in fact.'</p>

  <p>Father Brown nodded thoughtfully. 'Was any other instrument ever
  suggested?' he asked.</p>

  <p>'There was another suggestion,' answered Fiennes, 'from one of the young
  Druces&mdash;the cousins, I mean. Neither Herbert nor Harry Druce would have
  struck one at first as likely to be of assistance in scientific detection;
  but while Herbert was really the traditional type of heavy Dragoon, caring
  for nothing but horses and being an ornament to the Horse Guards, his younger
  brother Harry had been in the Indian Police and knew something about such
  things. Indeed, in his own way he was quite clever; and I rather fancy he had
  been too clever; I mean he had left the police through breaking some red-tape
  regulations and taking some sort of risk and responsibility of his own.
  Anyhow, he was in some sense a detective out of work, and threw himself into
  this business with more than the ardour of an amateur. And it was with him
  that I had an argument about the weapon&mdash;an argument that led to
  something new. It began by his countering my description of the dog barking
  at Traill; and he said that a dog at his worst didn't bark, but growled.'</p>

  <p>'He was quite right there,' observed the priest.</p>

  <p>'This young fellow went on to say that, if it came to that, he'd heard Nox
  growling at other people before then; and among others at Floyd, the
  secretary. I retorted that his own argument answered itself; for the crime
  couldn't be brought home to two or three people, and least of all to Floyd,
  who was as innocent as a harum-scarum schoolboy, and had been seen by
  everybody all the time perched above the garden hedge with his fan of red
  hair as conspicuous as a scarlet cockatoo.</p>

  <p>'I know there's difficulties anyhow,' said my colleague, 'but I wish you'd
  come with me down the garden a minute. I want to show you something I don't
  think any one else has seen.' This was on the very day of the discovery, and
  the garden was just as it had been. The step-ladder was still standing by
  the hedge, and just under the hedge my guide stopped and disentangled
  something from the deep grass. It was the sheers used for clipping the hedge,
  and on the point of one of them was a smear of blood.'</p>

  <p>There was a short silence, and then Father Brown said suddenly; 'What was
  the lawyer there for?'</p>

  <p>'He fold us the Colonel sent for him to alter his will,' answered Fiennes.
  'And, by the way, there was another thing about the business of the will that
  I ought to mention. You see, the will wasn't actually signed in the
  summer-house that afternoon.'</p>

  <p>'I suppose not,' said Father Brown; 'there would have to be two
  witnesses.'</p>

  <p>'The lawyer actually came down the day before and it was signed then; but
  he was sent for again next day because the old man had a doubt about one of
  the witnesses and had to be reassured.'</p>

  <p>'Who were the witnesses?' asked Father Brown.</p>

  <p>'That's just the point,' replied his informant eagerly, 'the witnesses
  were Floyd, the secretary, and this Dr Valentine, the foreign sort of surgeon
  or whatever he is; and the two had a quarrel. Now I'm bound to say that the
  secretary is something of a busybody. He's one of those hot and headlong
  people whose warmth of temperament has unfortunately turned mostly to
  pugnacity and bristling suspicion; to distrusting people instead of to
  trusting them. That sort of red-haired red-hot fellow is always either
  universally credulous or universally incredulous; and sometimes both. He was
  not only a Jack-of-all-trades, but he knew better than all tradesmen. He not
  only knew everything, but he warned everybody against everybody. All that
  must be taken into account in his suspicions about Valentine; but in that
  particular case there seems to have been something behind it. He said the
  name of Valentine was not really Valentine. He said he had seen him elsewhere
  known by the name of De Villon. He said it would invalidate the will; of
  course he was kind enough to explain to the lawyer what the law was on that
  point. They were both in a frightful wax.'</p>

  <p>Father Brown laughed. 'People often are when they are to witness a will,'
  he said; 'for one thing, it means that they can't have any legacy under it.
  But what did Dr Valentine say? No doubt the universal secretary knew more
  about the doctor's name than the doctor did. But even the doctor might have
  some information about his own name.'</p>

  <p>Fiennes paused a moment before he replied. 'Dr Valentine took it in a
  curious way. Dr Valentine is a curious man. His appearance is rather striking
  but very foreign. He is young but wears a beard cut square; and his face is
  very pale, dreadfully pale&mdash;and dreadfully serious. His eyes have a sort
  of ache in them, as if he ought to wear glasses, or had given himself a
  headache with thinking; but he is quite handsome and always very formally
  dressed, with a top hat and a dark coat and a little red rosette. His manner
  is rather cold and haughty, and he has a way of staring at you which is very
  disconcerting. When thus charged with having changed his name, he merely
  stared like a sphinx and then said with a little laugh that he supposed
  Americans had no names to change. At that I think the Colonel also got into a
  fuss and said all sorts of angry things to the doctor; all the more angry
  because of the doctor's pretensions to a future place in his family. But I
  shouldn't have thought much of that but for a few words that I happened to
  hear later, early in the afternoon of the tragedy. I don't want to make a lot
  of them, for they weren't the sort of words on which one would like, in the
  ordinary way, to play the eavesdropper. As I was passing out towards the
  front gate with my two companions and the dog, I heard voices which told me
  that Dr Valentine and Miss Druce had withdrawn for a moment in the shadow of
  the house, in an angle behind a row of flowering plants, and were talking to
  each other in passionate whisperings&mdash;sometimes almost like hissings;
  for it was something of a lovers' quarrel as well as a lovers' tryst. Nobody
  repeats the sort of things they said for the most part; but in an unfortunate
  business like this I'm bound to say that there was repeated more than once a
  phrase about killing somebody. In fact, the girl seemed to be begging him not
  to kill somebody, or saying that no provocation could justify killing
  anybody; which seems an unusual sort of talk to address to a gentleman who
  has dropped in to tea.'</p>

  <p>'Do you know,' asked the priest, 'whether Dr Valentine seemed to be very
  angry after the scene with the secretary and the Colonel&mdash;I mean about
  witnessing the will?'</p>

  <p>'By all accounts,' replied the other, 'he wasn't half so angry as the
  secretary was. It was the secretary who went away raging after witnessing the
  will.'</p>

  <p>'And now,' said Father Brown,' what about the will itself?'</p>

  <p>'The Colonel was a very wealthy man, and his will was important. Traill
  wouldn't tell us the alteration at that stage, but I have since heard&mdash;
  only this morning in fact&mdash;that most of the money was transferred from
  the son to the daughter. I told you that Druce was wild with my friend Donald
  over his dissipated hours.'</p>

  <p>'The question of motive has been rather over-shadowed by the question of
  method,' observed Father Brown thoughtfully. 'At that moment, apparently,
  Miss Druce was the immediate gainer by the death.'</p>

  <p>'Good God! What a cold-blooded way of talking,' cried Fiennes, staring at
  him. 'You don't really mean to hint that she&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Is she going to marry that Dr Valentine?' asked the other.</p>

  <p>'Some people are against it,' answered his friend. 'But he is liked and
  respected in the place and is a skilled and devoted surgeon.'</p>

  <p>'So devoted a surgeon,' said Father Brown, 'that he had surgical
  instruments with him when he went to call on the young lady at teatime. For
  he must have used a lancet or something, and he never seems to have gone
  home.'</p>

  <p>Fiennes sprang to his feet and looked at him in a heat of inquiry. 'You
  suggest he might have used the very same lancet&mdash;'</p>

  <p>Father Brown shook his head. 'All these suggestions are fancies just now,'
  he said. 'The problem is not who did it or what did it, but how it was done.
  We might find many men and even many tools&mdash;pins and shears and lancets.
  But how did a man get into the room? How did even a pin get into it?'</p>

  <p>He was staring reflectively at the ceiling as he spoke, but as he said the
  last words his eye cocked in an alert fashion as if he had suddenly seen a
  curious fly on the ceiling.</p>

  <p>'Well, what would you do about it?' asked the young man. 'You have a lot
  of experience; what would you advise now?'</p>

  <p>'I'm afraid I'm not much use,' said Father Brown with a sigh. 'I can't
  suggest very much without having ever been near the place or the people. For
  the moment you can only go on with local inquiries. I gather that your friend
  from the Indian Police is more or less in charge of your inquiry down there.
  I should run down and see how he is getting on. See what he's been doing in
  the way of amateur detection. There may be news already.'</p>

  <p>As his guests, the biped and the quadruped, disappeared, Father Brown took
  up his pen and went back to his interrupted occupation of planning a course
  of lectures on the Encyclical Rerum Novarum. The subject was a large one and
  he had to recast it more than once, so that he was somewhat similarly
  employed some two days later when the big black dog again came bounding into
  the room and sprawled all over him with enthusiasm and excitement. The master
  who followed the dog shared the excitement if not the enthusiasm. He had been
  excited in a less pleasant fashion, for his blue eyes seemed to start from
  his head and his eager face was even a little pale.</p>

  <p>'You told me,' he said abruptly and without preface, 'to find out what
  Harry Druce was doing. Do you know what he's done?' The priest did not reply,
  and the young man went on in jerky tones: I'll tell you what he's done. He's
  killed himself.'</p>

  <p>Father Brown's lips moved only faintly, and there was nothing practical
  about what he was saying&mdash;nothing that has anything to do with this
  story or this world.</p>

  <p>'You give me the creeps sometimes,' said Fiennes. 'Did you&mdash;did you
  expect this?'</p>

  <p>'I thought it possible,' said Father Brown; 'that was why I asked you to
  go and see what he was doing. I hoped you might not be too late.'</p>

  <p>'It was I who found him,' said Fiennes rather huskily. 'It was the ugliest
  and most uncanny thing fever knew. I went down that old garden again, and I
  knew there was something new and unnatural about it besides the murder. The
  flowers still tossed about in blue masses on each side of the black entrance
  into the old grey summer-house; but to me the blue flowers looked like blue
  devils dancing before some dark cavern of the underworld. I looked all round,
  everything seemed to be in its ordinary place. But the queer notion grew on
  me that there was something wrong with the very shape of the sky. And then I
  saw what it was. The Rock of Fortune always rose in the background beyond the
  garden hedge and against the sea. The Rock of Fortune was gone.'</p>

  <p>Father Brown had lifted his head and was listening intently.</p>

  <p>'It was as if a mountain had walked away out of a landscape or a moon
  fallen from the sky; though I knew, of course, that a touch at any time would
  have tipped the thing over. Something possessed me and I rushed down that
  garden path like the wind and went crashing through that hedge as if it were
  a spider's web. It was a thin hedge really, though its undisturbed trimness
  had made it serve all the purposes of a wall. On the shore I found the loose
  rock fallen from its pedestal; and poor Harry Druce lay like a wreck
  underneath it. One arm was thrown round it in a sort of embrace as if he had
  pulled it down on himself; and on the broad brown sands beside it, in large
  crazy lettering, he had scrawled the words: 'The Rock of Fortune falls on the
  Fool'.'</p>

  <p>'It was the Colonel's will that did that,' observed Father Brown. 'The
  young man had staked everything on profiting himself by Donald's disgrace,
  especially when his uncle sent for him on the same day as the lawyer, and
  welcomed him with so much warmth. Otherwise he was done; he'd lost his police
  job; he was beggared at Monte Carlo. And he killed himself when he found he'd
  killed his kinsman for nothing.'</p>

  <p>'Here, stop a minute!' cried the staring Fiennes. 'You're going too fast
  for me.'</p>

  <p>'Talking about the will, by the way,' continued Father Brown calmly,'
  before I forget it, or we go on to bigger things, there was a simple
  explanation, I think, of all that business about the doctor's name. I rather
  fancy I have heard both names before somewhere. The doctor is really a French
  nobleman with the title of the Marquis de Villon. But he is also an ardent
  Republican and has abandoned his title and fallen back on the forgotten
  family surname. 'With your Citizen Riquetti you have puzzled Europe for ten
  days.'</p>

  <p>'What is that?' asked the young man blankly.</p>

  <p>'Never mind,' said the priest. 'Nine times out of ten it is a rascally
  thing to change one's name; but this was a piece of fine fanaticism. That's
  the point of his sarcasm about Americans having no names&mdash;that is, no
  titles. Now in England the Marquis of Hartington is never called Mr
  Hartington; but in France the Marquis de Villon is called M. de Villon. So it
  might well look like a change of name. As for the talk about killing, I fancy
  that also was a point of French etiquette. The doctor was talking about
  challenging Floyd to a duel, and the girl was trying to dissuade him.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, I see,' cried Fiennes slowly. 'Now I understand what she meant.'</p>

  <p>'And what is that about?' asked his companion, smiling.</p>

  <p>'Well,' said the young man, 'it was something that happened to me just
  before I found that poor fellow's body; only the catastrophe drove it out of
  my head. I suppose it's hard to remember a little romantic idyll when you've
  just come on top of a tragedy. But as I went down the lanes leading to the
  Colonel's old place I met his daughter walking with Dr Valentine. She was in
  mourning, of course, and he always wore black as if he were going to a
  funeral; but I can't say that their faces were very funereal. Never have I
  seen two people looking in their own way more respectably radiant and
  cheerful. They stopped and saluted me, and then she told me they were married
  and living in a little house on the outskirts of the town, where the doctor
  was continuing his practice. This rather surprised me, because I knew that
  her old father's will had left her his property; and I hinted at it
  delicately by saying I was going along to her father's old place and had half
  expected to meet her there. But she only laughed and said: 'Oh, we've given
  up all that. My husband doesn't like heiresses.' And I discovered with some
  astonishment they really had insisted on restoring the property to poor
  Donald; so I hope he's had a healthy shock and will treat it sensibly. There
  was never much really the matter with him; he was very young and his father
  was not very wise. But it was in connexion with that that she said something
  I didn't understand at the time; but now I'm sure it must be as you say. She
  said with a sort of sudden and splendid arrogance that was entirely
  altruistic:</p>

  <p>''I hope it'll stop that red-haired fool from fussing any more about the
  will. Does he think my husband, who has given up a crest and a coronet as old
  as the Crusades for his principles, would kill an old man in a summer-house
  for a legacy like that?' Then she laughed again and said, 'My husband isn't
  killing anybody except in the way of business. Why, he didn't even ask his
  friends to call on the secretary.' Now, of course, I see what she meant.'</p>

  <p>'I see part of what she meant, of course,' said Father Brown. 'What did
  she mean exactly by the secretary fussing about the will?'</p>

  <p>Fiennes smiled as he answered, 'I wish you knew the secretary, Father
  Brown. It would be a joy to you to watch him make things hum, as he calls it.
  He made the house of mourning hum. He filled the funeral with all the snap
  and zip of the brightest sporting event. There was no holding him, after
  something had really happened. I've told you how he used to oversee the
  gardener as he did the garden, and how he instructed the lawyer in the law.
  Needless to say, he also instructed the surgeon in the practice of surgery;
  and as the surgeon was Dr Valentine, you may be sure it ended in accusing him
  of something worse than bad surgery. The secretary got it fixed in his red
  head that the doctor had committed the crime, and when the police arrived he
  was perfectly sublime. Need I say that he became, on the spot, the greatest
  of all amateur detectives? Sherlock Holmes never towered over Scotland Yard
  with more Titanic intellectual pride and scorn than Colonel Druce's private
  secretary over the police investigating Colonel Druce's death. I tell you it
  was a joy to see him. He strode about with an abstracted air, tossing his
  scarlet crest of hair and giving curt impatient replies. Of course it was his
  demeanour during these days that made Druce's daughter so wild with him. Of
  course he had a theory. It's just the sort of theory a man would have in a
  book; and Floyd is the sort of man who ought to be in a book. He'd be better
  fun and less bother in a book.'</p>

  <p>'What was his theory?' asked the other.</p>

  <p>'Oh, it was full of pep,' replied Fiennes gloomily. 'It would have been
  glorious copy if it could have held together for ten minutes longer. He said
  the Colonel was still alive when they found him in the summer-house, and
  the doctor killed him with the surgical instrument on pretence of cutting the
  clothes.'</p>

  <p>'I see,' said the priest. 'I suppose he was lying flat on his face on the
  mud floor as a form of siesta.'</p>

  <p>'It's wonderful what hustle will do,' continued his informant. ' I believe
  Floyd would have got his great theory into the papers at any rate, and
  perhaps had the doctor attested, when all these things were blown sky high as
  if by dynamite by the discovery of that dead body lying under the Rock of
  Fortune. And that's what we come back to after all. I suppose the suicide is
  almost a confession. But nobody will ever know the whole story.'</p>

  <p>There was a silence, and then the priest said modestly: 'I rather think I
  know the whole story.'</p>

  <p>Fiennes stared. 'But look here,' he cried; 'how do you come to know the
  whole story, or to be sure it's the true story? You've been sitting here a
  hundred miles away writing a sermon; do you mean to tell me you really know
  what happened already? If you've really come to the end, where in the world
  do you begin? What started you off with your own story?'</p>

  <p>Father Brown jumped up with a very unusual excitement and his first
  exclamation was like an explosion.</p>

  <p>'The dog!' he cried. 'The dog, of course! You had the whole story in your
  hands in the business of the dog on the beach, if you'd only noticed the dog
  properly.'</p>

  <p>Fiennes stared still more. 'But you told me before that my feelings about
  the dog were all nonsense, and the dog had nothing to do with it.'</p>

  <p>'The dog had everything to do with it,' said Father Brown, 'as you'd have
  found out if you'd only treated the dog as a dog, and not as God Almighty
  judging the souls of men.'</p>

  <p>He paused in an embarrassed way for a moment, and then said, with a rather
  pathetic air of apology: 'The truth is, I happen to be awfully fond of dogs.
  And it seemed to me that in all this lurid halo of dog superstitions nobody
  was really thinking about the poor dog at all. To begin with a small point,
  about his barking at the lawyer or growling at the secretary. You asked how I
  could guess things a hundred miles away; but honestly it's mostly to your
  credit, for you described people so well that I know the types. A man like
  Traill, who frowns usually and smiles suddenly, a man who fiddles with
  things, especially at his throat, is a nervous, easily embarrassed man. I
  shouldn't wonder if Floyd, the efficient secretary, is nervy and jumpy, too;
  those Yankee hustlers often are. Otherwise he wouldn't have cut his fingers
  on the shears and dropped them when he heard Janet Druce scream.</p>

  <p>'Now dogs hate nervous people. I don't know whether they make the dog
  nervous, too; or whether, being after all a brute, he is a bit of a bully; or
  whether his canine vanity (which is colossal) is simply offended at not being
  liked. But anyhow there was nothing in poor Nox protesting against those
  people, except that he disliked them for being afraid of him. Now I know
  you're awfully clever, and nobody of sense sneers at cleverness. But I
  sometimes fancy, for instance, that you are too clever to understand animals.
  Sometimes you are too clever to understand men, especially when they act
  almost as simply as animals. Animals are very literal; they live in a world
  of truisms. Take this case: a dog barks at a man and a man runs away from a
  dog. Now you do not seem to be quite simple enough to see the fact: that the
  dog barked because he disliked the man and the man fled because he was
  frightened of the dog. They had no other motives and they needed none; but
  you must read psychological mysteries into it and suppose the dog had
  super-normal vision, and was a mysterious mouthpiece of doom. You must
suppose the
  man was running away, not from the dog but from the hangman. And yet, if you
  come to think if it, all this deeper psychology is exceedingly improbable. If
  the dog really could completely and consciously realize the murderer of his
  master he wouldn't stand yapping as he might at a curate at a tea-party; he's
  much more likely to fly at his throat. And on the other hand, do you really
  think a man who had hardened his heart to murder an old friend and then walk
  about smiling at the old friend's family, under the eyes of his old friend's
  daughter and post-mortem doctor&mdash;do you think a man like that would be
  doubled up by mere remorse because a dog barked? He might feel the tragic
  irony of it; it might shake his soul, like any other tragic trifle. But he
  wouldn't rush madly the length of a garden to escape from the only witness
  whom he knew to be unable to talk. People have a panic like that when they
  are frightened, not of tragic ironies, but of teeth. The whole thing is
  simpler than you can understand.</p>

  <p>'But when we come to that business by the seashore, things are much more
  interesting. As you stated them, they were much more puzzling. I didn't
  understand that tale of the dog going in and out of the water; it didn't seem
  to me a doggy thing to do. If Nox had been very much upset about something
  else, he might possibly have refused to go after the stick at all. He'd
  probably go off nosing in whatever direction he suspected the mischief. But
  when once a dog is actually chasing a thing, a stone or a stick or a rabbit,
  my experience is that he won't stop for anything but the most peremptory
  command, and not always for that. That he should turn round because his mood
  changed seems to me unthinkable.'</p>

  <p>'But he did turn round,' insisted Fiennes; 'and came back without the
  stick.'</p>

  <p>'He came back without the stick for the best reason in the world,' replied
  the priest. 'He came back because he couldn't find it. He whined because be
  couldn't find it. That's the sort of thing a dog really does whine about. A
  dog is a devil of a ritualist. He is as particular about the precise routine
  of a game as a child about the precise repetition of a fairy-tale. In this
  case something had gone wrong with the game. He came back to complain
  seriously of the conduct of the stick. Never had such a thing happened
  before. Never had an eminent and distinguished dog been so treated by a
  rotten old walking-stick.'</p>

  <p>'Why, what had the walking ? stick done?' inquired the young man.</p>

  <p>'It had sunk,' said Father Brown.</p>

  <p>Fiennes said nothing, but continued to stare; and it was the priest who
  continued: 'It had sunk because it was not really a stick, but a rod of steel
  with a very thin shell of cane and a sharp point. In other words, it was a
  sword stick. I suppose a murderer never gets rid of a bloody weapon so oddly
  and yet so naturally as by throwing it into the sea for a retriever.'</p>

  <p>'I begin to see what you mean,' admitted Fiennes;' but even if a
  sword-stick was used, I have no guess of how it was used.'</p>

  <p>'I had a sort of guess,' said Father Brown, 'right at the beginning when
  you said the word summer-house. And another when you said that Druce wore a
  white coat. As long as everybody was looking for a short dagger, nobody
  thought of it; but if we admit a rather long blade like a rapier, it's not so
  impossible.'</p>

  <p>He was leaning back, looking at the ceiling, and began like one going back
  to his own first thoughts and fundamentals.</p>

  <p>'All that discussion about detective stories like the Yellow Room, about a
  man found dead in sealed chambers which no one could enter, does not apply to
  the present case, because it is a summer-house. When we talk of a Yellow
  Room, or any room, we imply walls that are really homogeneous and
  impenetrable. But a summer-house is not made like that; it is often made, as
  it was in this case, of closely interlaced but separate boughs and strips of
  wood, in which there are chinks here and there. There was one of them just
  behind Druce's back as he sat in his chair up against the wall. But just as
  the room was a summer-house, so the chair was a basket-chair. That also was
  a lattice of loopholes. Lastly, the summer-house was close up under the
  hedge; and you have just told me that it was really a thin hedge. A man
  standing outside it could easily see, amid a network of twigs and branches
  and canes, one white spot of the Colonel's coat as plain as the white of a
  target.</p>

  <p>'Now, you left the geography a little vague; but it was possible to put
  two and two together. You said the Rock of Fortune was not really high; but
  you also said it could be seen dominating the garden like a mountain-peak.
  In other words, it was very near the end of the garden, though your walk had
  taken you a long way round to it. Also, it isn't likely the young lady really
  howled so as to be heard half a mile. She gave an ordinary involuntary cry,
  and yet you heard it on the shore. And among other interesting things that
  you told me, may I remind you that you said Harry Druce had fallen behind to
  light his pipe under a hedge.'</p>

  <p>Fiennes shuddered slightly. 'You mean he drew his blade there and sent it
  through the hedge at the white spot. But surely it was a very odd chance and
  a very sudden choice. Besides, he couldn't be certain the old man's money had
  passed to him, and as a fact it hadn't.'</p>

  <p>Father Brown's face became animated. 'You misunderstand the man's
  character,' he said, as if he himself had known the man all his life. 'A
  curious but not unknown type of character. If he had really known the money
  would come to him, I seriously believe he wouldn't have done it. He would
  have seen it as the dirty thing it was.'</p>

  <p>'Isn't that rather paradoxical?' asked the other.</p>

  <p>'This man was a gambler,' said the priest, 'and a man in disgrace for
  having taken risks and anticipated orders. It was probably for something
  pretty unscrupulous, for every imperial police is more like a Russian secret
  police than we like to think. But he had gone beyond the line and failed.
  Now, the temptation of that type of man is to do a mad thing precisely
  because the risk will be wonderful in retrospect. He wants to say, 'Nobody
  but I could have seized that chance or seen that it was then or never. What a
  wild and wonderful guess it was, when I put all those things together; Donald
  in disgrace; and the lawyer being sent for; and Herbert and I sent for at the
  same time&mdash;and then nothing more but the way the old man grinned at me
  and shook hands. Anybody would say I was mad to risk it; but that is how
  fortunes are made, by the man mad enough to have a little foresight.' In
  short, it is the vanity of guessing. It is the megalomania of the gambler.
  The more incongruous the coincidence, the more instantaneous the decision,
  the more likely he is to snatch the chance. The accident, the very triviality
  of the white speck and the hole in the hedge intoxicated him like a vision of
  the world's desire. Nobody clever enough to see such a combination of
  accidents could be cowardly enough not to use them! That is how the devil
  talks to the gambler. But the devil himself would hardly have induced that
  unhappy man to go down in a dull, deliberate way and kill an old uncle from
  whom he'd always had expectations. It would be too respectable.'</p>

  <p>He paused a moment, and then went on with a certain quiet emphasis.</p>

  <p>'And now try to call up the scene, even as you saw it yourself. As he
  stood there, dizzy with his diabolical opportunity, he looked up and saw that
  strange outline that might have been the image of his own tottering soul; the
  one great crag poised perilously on the other like a pyramid on its point,
  and remembered that it was called the Rock of Fortune. Can you guess how such
  a man at such a moment would read such a signal? I think it strung him up to
  action and even to vigilance. He who would be a tower must not fear to be a
  toppling tower. Anyhow, he acted; his next difficulty was to cover his
  tracks. To be found with a sword-stick, let alone a blood-stained
  sword-stick, would be fatal in the search that was certain to follow. If he
  left it anywhere, it would be found and probably traced. Even if he threw it
  into the sea the action might be noticed, and thought noticeable&mdash;unless
  indeed he could think of some more natural way of covering the action. As you
  know, he did think of one, and a very good one. Being the only one of you
  with a watch, he told you it was not yet time to return, strolled a little
  farther, and started the game of throwing in sticks for the retriever. But
  how his eyes must have rolled darkly over all that desolate sea-shore before
  they alighted on the dog!'</p>

  <p>Fiennes nodded, gazing thoughtfully into space. His mind seemed to have
  drifted back to a less practical part of the narrative.</p>

  <p>'It's queer,' he said, 'that the dog really was in the story after
  all.'</p>

  <p>'The dog could almost have told you the story, if he could talk,' said the
  priest. 'All I complain of is that because he couldn't talk you made up his
  story for him, and made him talk with the tongues of men and angels. It's
  part of something I've noticed more and more in the modern world, appearing
  in all sorts of newspaper rumours and conversational catchwords; something
  that's arbitrary without being authoritative. People readily swallow the
  untested claims of this, that, or the other. It's drowning all your old
  rationalism and scepticism, it's coming in like a sea; and the name of it is
  superstition.' He stood up abruptly, his face heavy with a sort of frown, and
  went on talking almost as if he were alone. 'It's the first effect of not
  believing in God that you lose your common sense and can't see things as they
  are. Anything that anybody talks about, and says there's a good deal in it,
  extends itself indefinitely like a vista in a nightmare. And a dog is an
  omen, and a cat is a mystery, and a pig is a mascot, and a beetle is a
  scarab, calling up all the menagerie of polytheism from Egypt and old India;
  Dog Anubis and great green-eyed Pasht and all the holy howling Bulls of
  Bashan; reeling back to the bestial gods of the beginning, escaping into
  elephants and snakes and crocodiles; and all because you are frightened of
  four words:</p>

  <p>'He was made Man'.</p>

  <p>The young man got up with a little embarrassment, almost as if he had
  overheard a soliloquy. He called to the dog and left the room with vague but
  breezy farewells. But he had to call the dog twice, for the dog had remained
  behind quite motionless for a moment, looking up steadily at Father Brown as
  the wolf looked at St Francis.</p>

     name="story4">IV.&mdash;THE MIRACLE OF MOON CRESCENT</a></h2>

<h3>First published in <i>Nash's Magazine</i>, May 1924</h3>

  <p class="first">MOON CRESCENT was meant in a sense to be as romantic as its
  name; and the things that happened there were romantic enough in their way.
  At least it had been an expression of that genuine element of
  sentiment&mdash; historic and almost heroic&mdash;which manages to remain
  side by side with commercialism in the elder cities on the eastern coast of
  America. It was originally a curve of classical architecture really recalling
  that eighteenth-century atmosphere in which men like Washington and Jefferson
  had seemed to be all the more republicans for being aristocrats. Travellers
  faced with the recurrent query of what they thought of our city were
  understood to be specially answerable for what they thought of our Moon
  Crescent. The very contrasts that confuse its original harmony were
  characteristic of its survival. At one extremity or horn of the crescent its
  last windows looked over an enclosure like a strip of a gentleman's park,
  with trees and hedges as formal as a Queen Anne garden. But immediately round
  the corner, the other windows, even of the same rooms, or rather
  'apartments', looked out on the blank, unsightly wall of a huge warehouse
  attached to some ugly industry. The apartments of Moon Crescent itself were
  at that end remodelled on the monotonous pattern of an American hotel, and
  rose to a height, which, though lower than the colossal warehouse, would have
  been called a skyscraper in London. But the colonnade that ran round the
  whole frontage upon the street had a grey and weather-stained stateliness
  suggesting that the ghosts of the Fathers of the Republic might still be
  walking to and fro in it. The insides of the rooms, however, were as neat and
  new as the last New York fittings could make them, especially at the northern
  end between the neat garden and the blank warehouse wall. They were a system
  of very small flats, as we should say in England, each consisting of a
  sitting-room, bedroom, and bathroom, as identical as the hundred cells of a
  hive. In one of these the celebrated Warren Wynd sat at his desk sorting
  letters and scattering orders with wonderful rapidity and exactitude. He
  could only be compared to a tidy whirlwind.</p>

  <p>Warren Wynd was a very little man with loose grey hair and a pointed
  beard, seemingly frail but fierily active. He had very wonderful eyes,
  brighter than stars and stronger than magnets, which nobody who had ever seen
  them could easily forget. And indeed in his work as a reformer and regulator
  of many good works he had shown at least that he had a pair of eyes in his
  head. All sorts of stories and even legends were told of the miraculous
  rapidity with which he could form a sound judgement, especially of human
  character. It was said that he selected the wife who worked with him so long
  in so charitable a fashion, by picking her out of a whole regiment of women
  in uniform marching past at some official celebration, some said of the Girl
  Guides and some of the Women Police. Another story was told of how three
  tramps, indistinguishable from each other in their community of filth and
  rags, had presented themselves before him asking for charity. Without a
  moment's hesitation he had sent one of them to a particular hospital devoted
  to a certain nervous disorder, had recommended the second to an inebriates'
  home, and had engaged the third at a handsome salary as his own private
  servant, a position which he filled successfully for years afterwards. There
  were, of course, the inevitable anecdotes of his prompt criticisms and curt
  repartees when brought in contact with Roosevelt, with Henry Ford, and with
  Mrs Asquith and all other persons with whom an American public man ought to
  have a historic interview, if only in the newspapers. Certainly he was not
  likely to be overawed by such personages; and at the moment here in question
  he continued very calmly his centrifugal whirl of papers, though the man
  confronting him was a personage of almost equal importance.</p>

  <p>Silas T. Vandam, the millionaire and oil magnate, was a lean man with a
  long, yellow face and blue-black hair, colours which were the less
  conspicuous yet somehow the more sinister because his face and figure showed
  dark against the window and the white warehouse wall outside it; he was
  buttoned up tight in an elegant overcoat with strips of astrakhan. The eager
  face and brilliant eyes of Wynd, on the other hand, were in the full light
  from the other window over-looking the little garden, for his chair and desk
  stood facing it; and though the face was preoccupied, it did not seem unduly
  preoccupied about the millionaire. Wynd's valet or personal servant, a big,
  powerful man with flat fair hair, was standing behind his master's desk
  holding a sheaf of letters; and Wynd's private secretary, a neat, red-haired
  youth with a sharp face, had his hand already on the door handle, as if
  guessing some purpose or obeying some gesture of his employer. The room was
  not only neat, but austere to the point of emptiness; for Wynd, with
  characteristic thoroughness, had rented the whole floor above, and turned it
  into a loft or storeroom, where all his other papers and possessions were
  stacked in boxes and corded bales.</p>

  <p>'Give these to the floor-clerk, Wilson,' said Wynd to the servant holding
  the letters, 'and then get me the pamphlet on the Minneapolis Night Clubs;
  you'll find it in the bundle marked 'G'. I shall want it in half an hour, but
  don't disturb me till then. Well, Mr Vandam, I think your proposition sounds
  very promising; but I can't give a final answer till I've seen the report. It
  ought to reach me to-morrow afternoon, and I'll phone you at once. I'm sorry
  I can't say anything more definite just now.'</p>

  <p>Mr Vandam seemed to feel that this was something like a polite dismissal;
  and his sallow, saturnine face suggested that he found a certain irony in the
  fact.</p>

  <p>'Well, I suppose I must be going,' he said.</p>

  <p>'Very good of you to call, Mr Vandam,' said Wynd, politely; 'you will
  excuse my not coming out, as I've something here I must fix at once. Fenner,'
  he added to the secretary,' show Mr Vandam to his car, and don't come back
  again for half an hour. I've something here I want to work out by myself;
  after that I shall want you.'</p>

  <p>The three men went out into the hallway together, closing the door behind
  them. The big servant, Wilson, was turning down the hallway in the direction
  of the floor-clerk, and the other two moving in the opposite direction
  towards the lift; for Wynd's apartment was high up on the fourteenth floor.
  They had hardly gone a yard from the closed door when they became conscious
  that the corridor was filled with a marching and even magnificent figure. The
  man was very tall and broad-shouldered, his bulk being the more conspicuous
  for being clad in white, or a light grey that looked like it, with a very
  wide white panama hat and an almost equally wide fringe or halo of almost
  equally white hair. Set in this aureole his face was strong and handsome,
  like that of a Roman emperor, save that there was something more than boyish,
  something a little childish, about the brightness of his eyes and the
  beatitude of his smile. 'Mr Warren Wynd in?' he asked, in hearty tones.</p>

  <p>'Mr Warren Wynd is engaged,' said Fenner; 'he must not be disturbed on any
  account. I may say I am his secretary and can take any message.'</p>

  <p>'Mr Warren Wynd is not at home to the Pope or the Crowned Heads,' said
  Vandam, the oil magnate, with sour satire. 'Mr Warren Wynd is mighty
  particular. I went in there to hand him over a trifle of twenty thousand
  dollars on certain conditions, and, he told me to call again like as if I was
  a call-boy.'</p>

  <p>'It's a fine thing to be a boy,' said the stranger, 'and a finer to have a
  call; and I've got a call he's just got to listen to. It's a call of the
  great good country out West, where the real American is being made while
  you're all snoring. Just tell him that Art Alboin of Oklahoma City has come
  to convert him.'</p>

  <p>'I tell you nobody can see him,' said the red-haired secretary sharply.
  'He has given orders that he is not to be disturbed for half an hour.'</p>

  <p>'You folks down East are all against being disturbed,' said the breezy Mr
  Alboin, 'but I calculate there's a big breeze getting up in the West that
  will have to disturb you. He's been figuring out how much money must go to
  this and that stuffy old religion; but I tell you any scheme that leaves out
  the new Great Spirit movement in Texas and Oklahoma, is leaving out the
  religion of the future.'</p>

  <p>'Oh; I've sized up those religions of the future,' said the millionaire,
  contemptuously. 'I've been through them with a tooth-comb and they're as
  mangy as yellow dogs. There was that woman called herself Sophia: ought to
  have called herself Sapphira, I reckon. Just a plum fraud. Strings tied to
  all the tables and tambourines. Then there were the Invisible Life bunch;
  said they could vanish when they liked, and they did vanish, too, and a
  hundred thousand of my dollars vanished with them. I knew Jupiter Jesus out
  in Denver; saw him for weeks on end; and he was just a common crook. So was
  the Patagonian Prophet; you bet he's made a bolt for Patagonia. No, I'm
  through with all that; from now on I only believe what I see. I believe they
  call it being an atheist.'</p>

  <p>'I guess you got me wrong,' said the man from Oklahoma, almost eagerly. 'I
  guess I'm as much of an atheist as you are. No supernatural or superstitious
  stuff in our movement; just plain science. The only real right science is
  just health, and the only real right health is just breathing. Fill your
  lungs with the wide air of the prairie and you could blow all your old
  eastern cities into the sea. You could just puff away their biggest men like
  thistledown. That's what we do in the new movement out home: we breathe. We
  don't pray; we breathe.'</p>

  <p>'Well, I suppose you do,' said the secretary, wearily. He had a keen,
  intelligent face which could hardly conceal the weariness; but he had
  listened to the two monologues with the admirable patience and politeness (so
  much in contrast with the legends of impatience and insolence) with which
  such monologues are listened to in America.</p>

  <p>'Nothing supernatural,' continued Alboin, 'just the great natural fact
  behind all the supernatural fancies. What did the Jews want with a God except
  to breathe into man's nostrils the breath of life? We do the breathing into
  our own nostrils out in Oklahoma. What's the meaning of the very word Spirit?
  It's just the Greek for breathing exercises. Life, progress, prophecy; it's
  all breath.'</p>

  <p>'Some would allow it's all wind,' said Vandam; 'but I'm glad you've got
  rid of the divinity stunt, anyhow.'</p>

  <p>The keen face of the secretary, rather pale against his red hair, showed a
  flicker of some odd feeling suggestive of a secret bitterness.</p>

  <p>'I'm not glad,' he said, 'I'm just sure. You seem to like being atheists;
  so you may be just believing what you like to believe. But. I wish to God
  there were a God; and there ain't. It's just my luck.'</p>

  <p>Without a sound or stir they all became almost creepily conscious at this
  moment that the group, halted outside Wynd's door, had silently grown from
  three figures to four. How long the fourth figure had stood there none of the
  earnest disputants could tell, but he had every appearance of waiting
  respectfully and even timidly for the opportunity to say something urgent.
  But to their nervous sensibility he seemed to have sprung up suddenly and
  silently like a mushroom. And indeed, he looked rather like a big, black
  mushroom, for he was quite short and his small, stumpy figure was eclipsed by
  his big, black clerical hat; the resemblance might have been more complete if
  mushrooms were in the habit of carrying umbrellas, even of a shabby and
  shapeless sort.</p>

  <p>Fenner, the secretary, was conscious of a curious additional surprise at
  recognizing the figure of a priest; but when the priest turned up a round
  face under the round hat and innocently asked for Mr Warren Wynd, he gave the
  regular negative answer rather more curtly than before. But the priest stood
  his ground.</p>

  <p>'I do really want to see Mr Wynd,' he said. 'It seems odd, but that's
  exactly what I do want to do. I don't want to speak to him. I just want to
  see him. I just want to see if he's there to be seen.'</p>

  <p>'Well, I tell you he's there and can't be seen,' said Fenner, with
  increasing annoyance. 'What do you mean by saying you want to see if he's
  there to be seen? Of course he's there. We all left him there five minutes
  ago, and we've stood outside this door ever since.'</p>

  <p>'Well, I want to see if he's all right,' said the priest.</p>

  <p>'Why?' demanded the secretary, in exasperation. 'Because I have a serious,
  I might say solemn, reason,' said the cleric, gravely, 'for doubting whether
  he is all right.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, Lord!' cried Vandam, in a sort of fury; 'not more superstitions.'</p>

  <p>'I see I shall have to give my reasons,' observed the little cleric,
  gravely. 'I suppose I can't expect you even to let me look through the crack
  of a door till I tell you the whole story.' He was silent a moment as in
  reflection, and then went on without noticing the wondering faces around him.
  'I was walking outside along the front of the colonnade when I saw a very
  ragged man running hard round the corner at the end of the crescent. He came
  pounding along the pavement towards me, revealing a great raw-boned figure
  and a face I knew. It was the face of a wild Irish fellow I once helped a
  little; I will not tell you his name. When he saw me he staggered, calling me
  by mine and saying, 'Saints alive, it's Father Brown; you're the only man
  whose face could frighten me to-day.'</p>

  <p>'I knew he meant he'd been doing some wild thing or other, and I don't
  think my face frightened him much, for he was soon telling me about it. And a
  very strange thing it was. He asked me if I knew Warren Wynd, and I said no,
  though I knew he lived near the top of these flats. He said, 'That's a man
  who thinks he's a saint of God; but if he knew what I was saying of him he
  should be ready to hang himself.' And he repeated hysterically more than
  once, 'Yes, ready to hang himself.' I asked him if he'd done any harm to
  Wynd, and his answer was rather a queer one. He said: 'I took a pistol and I
  loaded it with neither shot nor slug, but only with a curse.' As far as I
  could make out, all he had done was to go down that little alley between this
  building and the big warehouse, with an old pistol loaded with a blank
  charge, and merely fire it against the wall, as if that would bring down the
  building. 'But as I did it,' he said, 'I cursed him with the great curse,
  that the justice of God should take him by the hair and the vengeance of hell
  by the heels, and he should be torn asunder like Judas and the world know him
  no more.'</p>

  <p>'Well, it doesn't matter now what else I said to the poor, crazy fellow;
  he went away quieted down a little, and I went round to the back of the
  building to inspect. And sure enough, in the little alley at the foot of this
  wall there lay a rusty antiquated pistol; I know enough about pistols to know
  it had been loaded only with a little powder, there were the black marks of
  powder and smoke on the wall, and even the mark of the muzzle, but not even a
  dent of any bullet. He had left no trace of destruction; he had left no trace
  of anything, except those black marks and that black curse he had hurled into
  heaven. So I came back here to ask for this Warren Wynd and find out if he's
  all right.'</p>

  <p>Penner the secretary laughed. 'I can soon settle that difficulty for you.
  I assure you he's quite all right; we left him writing at his desk only a few
  minutes ago. He was alone in his flat; it's a hundred feet up from the
  street, and so placed that no shot could have reached him, even if your
  friend hadn't fired blank. There's no other entrance to this place but this
  door, and we've been standing outside it ever since.'</p>

  <p>'All the same,' said Father Brown, gravely, 'I should like to look in and
  see.'</p>

  <p>'Well, you can't,' retorted the other. 'Good Lord, you don't tell me you
  think anything of the curse.'</p>

  <p>'You forget,' said the millionaire, with a slight sneer, 'the reverend
  gentleman's whole business is blessings and cursings. Come, sir, if he's been
  cursed to hell, why don't you bless him back again? What's the good of your
  blessings if they can't beat an Irish larrykin's curse?'</p>

  <p>'Does anybody believe such things now?' protested the Westerner.</p>

  <p>'Father Brown believes a good number of things, I take it,' said Vandam,
  whose temper was suffering from the past snub and the present bickering.
  'Father Brown believes a hermit crossed a river on a crocodile conjured out
  of nowhere, and then he told the crocodile to die, and it sure did. Father
  Brown believes that some blessed saint or other died, and had his dead body
  turned into three dead bodies, to be served out to three parishes that were
  all I bent on figuring as his home-town. Father Brown believes that a saint
  hung his cloak on a sunbeam, and another used his for a boat to cross the
  Atlantic. Father Brown believes the holy donkey had six legs and the house of
  Loretto flew through the air. He believes in hundreds of stone virgins
  winking and weeping all day long. It's nothing to him to believe that a man
  might escape through the keyhole or vanish out of a locked room. I reckon he
  doesn't take much stock of the laws of nature.'</p>

  <p>'Anyhow, I have to take stock in the laws of Warren Wynd,' said the
  secretary, wearily, 'and it's his rule that he's to be left alone when he
  says so. Wilson will tell you just the same,' for the large servant who had
  been sent for the pamphlet, passed placidly down the corridor even as he
  spoke, carrying the pamphlet, but serenely passing the door. 'He'll go and
  sit on the bench by the floor-clerk and twiddle his thumbs till he's wanted;
  but he won't go in before then; and nor will I. I reckon we both know which
  side our bread is buttered, and it'd take a good many of Father Brown's saint
  and angels to make us forget it.'</p>

  <p>'As for saints and angels&mdash;' began the priest.</p>

  <p>'It's all nonsense,' repeated Fenner. 'I don't want to say anything
  offensive, but that sort of thing may be very well for crypts and cloisters
  and all sorts of moonshiny places. But ghosts can't get through a closed door
  in an American hotel.'</p>

  <p>'But men can open a door, even in an American hotel,' replied Father
  Brown, patiently. 'And it seems to me the simplest thing would be to open
  it.'</p>

  <p>'It would be simple enough to lose me my job,' answered the secretary,
  'and Warren Wynd doesn't like his secretaries so simple as that. Not simple
  enough to believe in the sort of fairy tales you seem to believe in.'</p>

  <p>'Well,' said the priest gravely, 'it is true enough that I believe in a
  good many things that you probably don't. But it would take a considerable
  time to explain all the things I believe in, and all the reasons I have for
  thinking I'm right. It would take about two seconds to open that door and
  prove I am wrong.'</p>

  <p>Something in the phrase seemed to please the more wild and restless spirit
  of the man from the West.</p>

  <p>'I'll allow I'd love to prove you wrong,' said Alboin, striding suddenly
  past them, 'and I will.'</p>

  <p>He threw open the door of the flat and looked in. The first glimpse showed
  that Warren Wynd's chair was empty. The second glance showed that his room
  was empty also.</p>

  <p>Fenner, electrified with energy in his turn, dashed past the other into
  the apartment.</p>

  <p>'He's in his bedroom,' be said curtly, 'he must be.'</p>

  <p>As he disappeared into the inner chamber the other men stood in the empty
  outer room staring about them. The severity and simplicity of its fittings,
  which had already been noted, returned on them with a rigid challenge.
  Certainly in this room there was no question of hiding a mouse, let alone a
  man. There were no curtains and, what is rare in American arrangements, no
  cupboards. Even the desk was no more than a plain table with a shallow drawer
  and a tilted lid. The chairs were hard and high-backed skeletons. A moment
  after the secretary reappeared at the inner door, having searched the two
  inner rooms. A staring negation stood in his eyes, and his mouth seemed to
  move in a mechanical detachment from it as he said sharply: 'He didn't come
  out through here?'</p>

  <p>Somehow the others did not even think it necessary to answer that negation
  in the negative. Their minds had come up against something like the blank
  wall of the warehouse that stared in at the opposite window, gradually
  turning from white to grey as dusk slowly descended with the advancing
  afternoon. Vandam walked over to the window-sill against which he had leant
  half an hour before and looked out of the open window. There was no pipe or
  fire-escape, no shelf or foothold of any kind on the sheer fall to the little
  by-street below, there was nothing on the similar expanse of wall that rose
  many stories above. There was even less variation on the other side of the
  street; there was nothing whatever but the wearisome expanse of whitewashed
  wall. He peered downwards, as if expecting to see the vanished philanthropist
  lying in a suicidal wreck on the path. He could see nothing but one small
  dark object which, though diminished by distance, might well be the pistol
  that the priest had found lying there. Meanwhile, Fenner had walked to the
  other window, which looked out from a wall equally blank and inaccessible,
  but looking out over a small ornamental park instead of a side street. Here a
  clump of trees interrupted the actual view of the ground; but they reached
  but a little way up the huge human cliff. Both turned back into the room and
  faced each other in the gathering twilight where the last silver gleams of
  daylight on the shiny tops of desks and tables were rapidly turning grey. As
  if the twilight itself irritated him, Fenner touched the switch and the scene
  sprang into the startling distinctness of electric light.</p>

  <p>'As you said just now,' said Vandam grimly, 'there's no shot from down
  there could bit him, even if there was a shot in the gun. But even if he was
  hit with a bullet he wouldn't have just burst like a bubble.'</p>

  <p>The secretary, who was paler than ever, glanced irritably at the bilious
  visage of the millionaire. 'What's got you started on those morbid notions?
  Who's talking about bullets and bubbles? Why shouldn't he be alive?'</p>

  <p>'Why not indeed?' replied Vandam smoothly. 'If you'll tell me where he is,
  I'll tell you how he got there.'</p>

  <p>After a pause the secretary muttered, rather sulkily: 'I suppose you're
  right. We're right up against the very thing we were talking about. It'd be a
  queer thing if you or I ever came to think there was anything in cursing. But
  who could have harmed Wynd shut up in here?'</p>

  <p>Mr Alboin, of Oklahoma, had been standing rather astraddle in the middle
  of the room, his white, hairy halo as well as his round eyes seeming to
  radiate astonishment. At this point he said, abstractedly, with something of
  the irrelevant impudence of an enfant terrible: 'You didn't cotton to him
  much, did you, Mr Vandam?'</p>

  <p>Mr Vandam's long yellow face seemed to grow longer as it grew more
  sinister, while he smiled and answered quietly: 'If it comes to these
  coincidences, it was you, I think, who said that a wind from the West would
  blow away out big men like thistledown.'</p>

  <p>'I know I said it would,' said the Westerner, with candour; 'but all the
  same, how the devil could it?'</p>

  <p>The silence was broken by Fenner saying with an abruptness amounting to
  violence: 'There's only one thing to say about this affair. It simply hasn't
  happened. It can't have happened.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, yes,' said Father Brown out of the corner; 'it has happened all
  right.'</p>

  <p>They all jumped; for the truth was they had all forgotten the
  insignificant little man who had originally induced them to open the door.
  And the recovery of memory went with a sharp reversal of mood; it came back
  to them with a rush that they had all dismissed him as a superstitious
  dreamer for even hinting at the very thing that had since happened before
  their eyes.</p>

  <p>'Snakes!' cried the impetuous Westerner, like one speaking before he could
  stop himself; 'suppose there were something in it, after all!'</p>

  <p>'I must confess,' said Fenner, frowning at the table, 'that his
  reverence's anticipations were apparently well founded. I don't know whether
  he has anything else to tell us.'</p>

  <p>'He might possibly tell us,' said Vandam, sardonically, 'what the devil we
  are to do now.'</p>

  <p>The little priest seemed to accept the position in a modest, but
  matter-of-fact manner. 'The only thing I can think of,' he said, 'is first to
  tell the authorities of this place, and then to see if there were any more
  traces of my man who let off the pistol. He vanished round the other end of
  the Crescent where the little garden is. There are seats there, and it's a
  favourite place for tramps.'</p>

  <p>Direct consultations with the headquarters of the hotel, leading to
  indirect consultations with the authorities of the police, occupied them for
  a considerable time; and it was already nightfall when they went out under
  the long, classical curve of the colonnade. The crescent looked as cold and
  hollow as the moon after which it was named, and the moon itself was rising
  luminous but spectral behind the black tree-tops when they turned the corner
  by the little public garden. Night veiled much of what was merely urban and
  artificial about the place, and as they melted into the shadows of the trees
  they had a strange feeling of having suddenly travelled many hundred miles
  from their homes. When they had walked in silence for a little, Alboin, who
  had something elemental about him, suddenly exploded.</p>

  <p>'I give up,' he cried; 'I hand in my checks. I never thought I should come
  to such things; but what happens when the things come to you? I beg your
  pardon, Father Brown; I reckon I'll just come across, so far as you and your
  fairy-tales are concerned. After this, it's me for the fairy-tales. Why,
  you said yourself, Mr Vandam, that you're an atheist and only believe what
  you see. Well, what was it you did see? Or rather, what was it you didn't
  see?'</p>

  <p>'I know,' said Vandam and nodded in a gloomy fashion.</p>

  <p>'Oh, it's partly all this moon and trees that get on one's nerves,' said
  Fenner obstinately. 'Trees always look queer by moonlight, with their
  branches crawling about. Look at that&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Yes,' said Father Brown, standing still and peering at the moon through a
  tangle of trees. 'That's a very queer branch up there.'</p>

  <p>When he spoke again he only said: 'I thought it was a broken branch.'</p>

  <p>But this time there was a catch in his voice that unaccountably turned his
  hearers cold. Something that looked rather like a dead branch was certainly
  dependent in a limp fashion from the tree that showed dark against the moon;
  but it was not a dead branch. When they came close to it to see what it was
  Fenner sprang away again with a ringing oath. Then he ran in again and
  loosened a rope from the neck of the dingy little body dangling with drooping
  plumes of grey hair. Somehow he knew that the body was a dead body before he
  managed to take it down from the tree. A very long coil of rope was wrapped
  round and round the branches, and a comparatively short length of it hung
  from the fork of the branch to the body. A long garden tub was rolled a yard
  or so from under the feet, like the stool kicked away from the feet of a
  suicide.</p>

  <p>'Oh, my God!' said Alboin, so that it seemed as much a prayer as an oath.'
  What was it that man said about him?&mdash;'If he knew, he would be ready to
  hang himself.' Wasn't that what he said, Father Brown?'</p>

  <p>'Yes,' said Father Brown.</p>

  <p>'Well,' said Vandam in a hollow voice, 'I never thought to see or say such
  a thing. But what can one say except that the curse has worked?'</p>

  <p>Fenner was standing with hands covering his face; and the priest laid a
  hand on his arm and said, gently, 'Were you very fond of him?'</p>

  <p>The secretary dropped his hands and his white face was ghastly under the
  moon.</p>

  <p>'I hated him like hell,' he said; 'and if he died by a curse it might have
  been mine.'</p>

  <p>The pressure of the priest's hand on his arm tightened; and the priest
  said, with an earnestness he had hardly yet shown: 'It wasn't your curse;
  pray be comforted.'</p>

  <p>The police of the district had considerable difficulty in dealing with the
  four witnesses who were involved in the case. All of them were reputable, and
  even reliable people in the ordinary sense; and one of them was a person of
  considerable power and importance: Silas Vandam of the Oil Trust. The first
  police-officer who tried to express scepticism about his story struck sparks
  from the steel of that magnate's mind very rapidly indeed.</p>

  <p>'Don't you talk to me about sticking to the facts,' said the millionaire
  with asperity. 'I've stuck to a good many facts before you were born and a
  few of the facts have stuck to me. I'll give you the facts all right if
  you've got the sense to take 'em down correctly.'</p>

  <p>The policeman in question was youthful and subordinate, and had a hazy
  idea that the millionaire was too political to be treated as an ordinary
  citizen; so he passed him and his companions on to a more stolid superior,
  one Inspector Collins, a grizzled man with a grimly comfortable way of
  talking; as one who was genial but would stand no nonsense.</p>

  <p>'Well, well,' he said, looking at the three figures before him with
  twinkling eyes, 'this seems to be a funny sort of a tale.'</p>

  <p>Father Brown had already gone about his daily business; but Silas Vandam
  had suspended even the gigantic business of the markets for an hour or so to
  testify to his remarkable experience. Fenner's business as secretary had
  ceased in a sense with his employer's life; and the great Art Alboin, having
  no business in New York or anywhere else, except the spreading of the Breath
  of Life religion or the Great Spirit, had nothing to draw him away at the
  moment from the immediate affair. So they stood in a row in the inspector's
  office, prepared to corroborate each other.</p>

  <p>'Now I'd better tell you to start with,' said the inspector cheerfully,
  'that it's no good for anybody to come to me with any miraculous stuff. I'm a
  practical man and a policeman, and that sort of thing is all very well for
  priests and parsons. This priest of yours seems to have got you all worked up
  about some story of a dreadful death and judgement; but I'm going to leave
  him and his religion out of it altogether. If Wynd came out of that room,
  somebody let him out. And if Wynd was found hanging on that tree, somebody
  hung him there.'</p>

  <p>'Quite so,' said Fenner; 'but as out evidence is that nobody let him out,
  the question is how could anybody have hung him there?'</p>

  <p>'How could anybody have a nose on his face?' asked the inspector. 'He had
  a nose on his face, and he had a noose round his neck. Those are facts; and,
  as I say, I'm a practical man and go by the facts. It can't have been done by
  a miracle, so it must have been done by a man.'</p>

  <p>Alboin had been standing rather in the background; and indeed his broad
  figure seemed to form a natural background to the leaner and more vivacious
  men in front of him. His white head was bowed with a certain abstraction; but
  as the inspector said the last sentence, he lifted it, shaking his hoary mane
  in a leonine fashion, and looking dazed but awakened. He moved forward into
  the centre of the group, and they had a vague feeling that he was even vaster
  than before. They had been only too prone to take him for a fool or a
  mountebank; but he was not altogether wrong when he said that there was in
  him a certain depth of lungs and life, like a west wind stored up in its
  strength, which might some day puff lighter things away.</p>

  <p>'So you're a practical man, Mr Collins,' he said, in a voice at once soft
  and heavy. 'It must be the second or third time you've mentioned in this
  little conversation that you are a practical man; so I can't be mistaken
  about that. And a very interesting little fact it is for anybody engaged in
  writing your life, letters, and table-talk, with portrait at the age of five,
  daguerreotype of your grandmother and views of the old home-town; and I'm
  sure your biographer won't forget to mention it along with the fact that you
  had a pug nose with a pimple on it, and were nearly too fat to walk. And as
  you're a practical man, perhaps you would just go on practising till you've
  brought Warren Wynd to life again, and found out exactly how a practical man
  gets through a deal door. But I think you've got it wrong. You're not a
  practical man. You're a practical joke; that's what you are. The Almighty was
  having a bit of fun with us when he thought of you.'</p>

  <p>With a characteristic sense of drama he went sailing towards the door
  before the astonished inspector could reply; and no after-recriminations
  could rob him of a certain appearance of triumph.</p>

  <p>'I think you were perfectly right,' said Fenner. 'If those are practical
  men, give me priests.'</p>

  <p>Another attempt was made to reach an official version of the event when
  the authorities fully realized who were the backers of the story, and what
  were the implications of it. Already it had broken out in the Press in its
  most sensationally and even shamelessly psychic form. Interviews with Vandam
  on his marvellous adventure, articles about Father Brown and his mystical
  intuitions, soon led those who feel responsible for guiding the public, to
  wish to guide it into a wiser channel. Next time the inconvenient witnesses
  were approached in a more indirect and tactful manner. They were told, almost
  in an airy fashion, that Professor Vair was very much interested in such
  abnormal experiences; was especially interested in their own astonishing
  case. Professor Vair was a psychologist of great distinction; he had been
  known to take a detached interest in criminology; it was only some little
  time afterwards that they discovered that he was in any way connected with
  the police.</p>

  <p>Professor Vair was a courteous gentleman, quietly dressed in pale grey
  clothes, with an artistic tie and a fair, pointed beard; he looked more like
  a landscape painter to anyone not acquainted with a certain special type of
  don. He had an air not only of courtesy, but of frankness.</p>

  <p>'Yes, yes, I know,' he said smiling; 'I can guess what you must have gone
  through. The police do not shine in inquiries of a psychic sort, do they? Of
  course, dear old Collins said he only wanted the facts. What an absurd
  blunder! In a case of this kind we emphatically do not only want the facts.
  It is even more essential to have the fancies.'</p>

  <p>'Do you mean,' asked Vandam gravely, 'that all that we thought facts were
  merely fancies?'</p>

  <p>'Not at all,' said the professor; 'I only mean that the police are stupid
  in thinking they can leave out the psychological element in these things.
  Well, of course, the psychological element is everything in everything,
  though it is only just beginning to be understood. To begin with, take the
  element called personality. Now I have heard of this priest, Father Brown,
  before; and he is one of the most remarkable men of our time. Men of that
  sort carry a sort of atmosphere with them; and nobody knows how much his
  nerves and even his very senses are affected by it for the time being. People
  are hypnotized&mdash;yes, hypnotized; for hypnotism, like everything else, is
  a matter of degree; it enters slightly into all daily conversation: it is not
  necessarily conducted by a man in evening-dress on a platform in a public
  hall. Father Brown's religion has always understood the psychology of
  atmospheres, and knows bow to appeal to everything simultaneously; even, for
  instance, to the sense of smell. It understands those curious effects
  produced by music on animals and human beings; it can&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Hang it,' protested Fenner, 'you don't think he walked down the corridor
  carrying a church organ?'</p>

  <p>'He knows better than to do that,' said Professor Vair laughing. 'He knows
  how to concentrate the essence of all these spiritual sounds and sights, and
  even smells, in a few restrained gestures; in an art or school of manners. He
  could contrive so to concentrate your minds on the supernatural by his mere
  presence, that natural things slipped off your minds to left and right
  unnoticed. Now you know,' he proceeded with a return to cheerful good sense,
  'that the more we study it the more queer the whole question of human
  evidence becomes. There is not one man in twenty who really observes things
  at all. There is not one man in a hundred who observes them with real
  precision; certainly not one in a hundred who can first observe, then
  remember, and finally describe. Scientific experiments have been made again
  and again showing that men under strain have thought a door was shut when it
  was open, or open when it was shut. Men have differed about the number of
  doors or windows in a wall just in front of them. They have suffered optical
  illusions in broad daylight. They have done this even without the hypnotic
  effect of personality; but here we have a very powerful and persuasive
  personality bent upon fixing only one picture on your minds; the picture of
  the wild Irish rebel shaking his pistol at the sky and firing that vain
  volley, whose echoes were the thunders of heaven.'</p>

  <p>'Professor,' cried Fenner, 'I'd swear on my deathbed that door never
  opened.'</p>

  <p>'Recent experiments,' went on the professor, quietly, 'have suggested that
  our consciousness is not continuous, but is a succession of very rapid
  impressions like a cinema; it is possible that somebody or something may, so
  to speak, slip in or out between the scenes. It acts only in the instant
  while the curtain is down. Probably the patter of conjurors and all forms of
  sleight of hand depend on what we may call these black flashes of blindness
  between the flashes of sight. Now this priest and preacher of transcendental
  notions had filled you with a transcendental imagery; the image of the Celt
  like a Titan shaking the tower with his curse. Probably he accompanied it
  with some slight but compelling gesture, pointing your eyes and minds in the
  direction of the unknown destroyer below. Or perhaps something else happened,
  or somebody else passed by.'</p>

  <p>'Wilson, the servant,' grunted Alboin, 'went down the hallway to wait on
  the bench, but I guess he didn't distract us much.'</p>

  <p>'You never know how much,' replied Vair; 'it might have been that or more
  likely your eyes following some gesture of the priest as he told his tale of
  magic. It was in one of those black flashes that Mr Warren Wynd slipped out
  of his door and went to his death. That is the most probable explanation. It
  is an illustration of the new discovery. The mind is not a continuous line,
  but rather a dotted line.'</p>

  <p>'Very dotted,' said Fenner feebly. 'Not to say dotty.'</p>

  <p>'You don't really believe,' asked Vair, 'that your employer was shut up in
  a room like a box?'</p>

  <p>'It's better than believing that I ought to be shut up in a room like a
  padded cell,' answered Fenner. 'That's what I complain of in your
  suggestions, professor. I'd as soon believe in a priest who believes in a
  miracle, as disbelieve in any man having any right to believe in a fact. The
  priest tells me that a man can appeal to a God I know nothing about to avenge
  him by the laws of some higher justice that I know nothing about. There's
  nothing for me to say except that I know nothing about it. But, at least, if
  the poor Paddy's prayer and pistol could be heard in a higher world, that
  higher world might act in some way that seems odd to us. But you ask me to
  disbelieve the facts of this world as they appear to my own five wits.
  According to you, a whole procession of Irishmen carrying blunderbusses may
  have walked through this room while we were talking, so long as they took
  care to tread on the blind spots in our minds. Miracles of the monkish sort,
  like materializing a crocodile or hanging a cloak on a sunbeam, seem quite
  sane compared to you.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, well,' said Professor Vair, rather curtly, 'if you are resolved to
  believe in your priest and his miraculous Irishman I can say no more. I'm
  afraid you have not had an opportunity of studying psychology.'</p>

  <p>'No,' said Fenner dryly; 'but I've had an opportunity of studying
  psychologists.'</p>

  <p>And, bowing politely, he led his deputation out of the room and did not
  speak till he got into the street; then he addressed them rather
  explosively.</p>

  <p>'Raving lunatics!' cried Fenner in a fume. 'What the devil do they think
  is to happen to the world if nobody knows whether he's seen anything or not?
  I wish I'd blown his silly head off with a blank charge, and then explained
  that I did it in a blind flash. Father Brown's miracle may be miraculous or
  no, but he said it would happen and it did happen. All these blasted cranks
  can do is to see a thing happen and then say it didn't. Look here, I think we
  owe it to the padre to testify to his little demonstration. We're all sane,
  solid men who never believed in anything. We weren't drunk. We weren't
  devout. It simply happened just as he said it would.'</p>

  <p>'I quite agree,' said the millionaire. 'It may be the beginning of mighty
  big things in the spiritual line; but anyhow, the man who's in the spiritual
  line himself, Father Brown, has certainly scored over this business.'</p>

  <p>A few days afterwards Father Brown received a very polite note signed
  Silas T. Vandam, and asking him if he would attend at a stated hour at the
  apartment which was the scene of the disappearance, in order to take steps
  for the establishment of that marvellous occurrence. The occurrence itself
  had already begun to break out in the newspapers, and was being taken up
  everywhere by the enthusiasts of occultism. Father Brown saw the flaring
  posters inscribed 'Suicide of Vanishing Man', and 'Man's Curse Hangs
  Philanthropist', as he passed towards Moon Crescent and mounted the steps on
  the way to the elevator. He found the little group much as he left it,
  Vandam, Alboin, and the secretary; but there was an entirely new
  respectfulness and even reverence in their tone towards himself. They were
  standing by Wynd's desk, on which lay a large paper and writing materials;
  they turned to greet him.</p>

  <p>'Father Brown,' said the spokesman, who was the white-haired Westerner,
  somewhat sobered with his responsibility, 'we asked you here in the first
  place to offer our apologies and our thanks. We recognize that it was you
  that spotted the spiritual manifestation from the first. We were hard-shell
  sceptics, all of us; but we realize now that a man must break that shell to
  get at the great things behind the world. You stand for those things; you
  stand for the super-normal explanation of things; and we have to hand it to
  you. And in the second place, we feel that this document would not be
  complete without your signature. We are notifying the exact facts to the
  Psychical Research Society, because the newspaper accounts are not what you
  might call exact. We've stated how the curse was spoken out in the street;
  how the man was sealed up here in a room like a box; how the curse dissolved
  him straight into thin air, and in some unthinkable way materialized him as a
  suicide hoisted on a gallows. That's all we can say about it; but all that we
  know, and have seen with our own eyes. And as you were the first to believe
  in the miracle, we all feel that you ought to be the first to sign.'</p>

  <p>'No, really,' said Father Brown, in embarrassment. 'I don't think I should
  like to do that.'</p>

  <p>'You mean you'd rather not sign first?'</p>

  <p>'I mean I'd rather not sign at all,' said Father Brown, modestly. 'You
  see, it doesn't quite do for a man in my position to joke about
  miracles.'</p>

  <p>'But it was you who said it was a miracle,' said Alboin, staring.</p>

  <p>'I'm so sorry,' said Father Brown; 'I'm afraid there's some mistake. I
  don't think I ever said it was a miracle. All I said was that it might
  happen. What you said was that it couldn't happen, because it would be a
  miracle if it did. And then it did. And so you said it was a miracle. But I
  never said a word about miracles or magic, or anything of the sort from
  beginning to end.'</p>

  <p>'But I thought you believed in miracles,' broke out the secretary.</p>

  <p>'Yes,' answered Father Brown, 'I believe in miracles. I believe in
  man-eating tigers, but I don't see them running about everywhere. If I want
any
  miracles, I know where to get them.'</p>

  <p>'I can't understand your taking this line, Father Brown,' said Vandam,
  earnestly. 'It seems so narrow; and you don't look narrow to me, though you
  are a parson. Don't you see, a miracle like this will knock all materialism
  endways? It will just tell the whole world in big print that spiritual powers
  can work and do work. You'll be serving religion as no parson ever served it
  yet.'</p>

  <p>The priest had stiffened a little and seemed in some strange way clothed
  with unconscious and impersonal dignity, for all his stumpy figure. 'Well,'
  he said, 'you wouldn't suggest I should serve religion by what I know to be a
  lie? I don't know precisely what you mean by the phrase; and, to be quite
  candid, I'm not sure you do. Lying may be serving religion; I'm sure it's not
  serving God. And since you are harping so insistently on what I believe,
  wouldn't it be as well if you had some sort of notion of what it is?'</p>

  <p>'I don't think I quite understand,' observed the millionaire,
  curiously.</p>

  <p>'I don't think you do,' said Father Brown, with simplicity. 'You say this
  thing was done by spiritual powers. What spiritual powers? You don't think
  the holy angels took him and hung him on a garden tree, do you? And as for
  the unholy angels&mdash;no, no, no. The men who did this did a wicked thing,
  but they went no further than their own wickedness; they weren't wicked
  enough to be dealing with spiritual powers. I know something about Satanism,
  for my sins; I've been forced to know. I know what it is, what it practically
  always is. It's proud and it's sly. It likes to be superior; it loves to
  horrify the innocent with things half understood, to make children's flesh
  creep. That's why it's so fond of mysteries and initiations and secret
  societies and all the rest of it. Its eyes are turned inwards, and however
  grand and grave it may look, it's always hiding a small, mad smile.' He
  shuddered suddenly, as if caught in an icy draught of air. 'Never mind about
  them; they've got nothing to do with this, believe me. Do you think that
  poor, wild Irishman of mine, who ran raving down the street, who blurted out
  half of it when he first saw my face, and ran away for fear he should blurt
  out more, do you think Satan confides any secrets to him? I admit he joined
  in a plot, probably in a plot with two other men worse than himself; but for
  all that, he was just in an everlasting rage when he rushed down the lane and
  let off his pistol and his curse.'</p>

  <p>'But what on earth does all this mean?' demanded Vandam. 'Letting off a
  toy pistol and a twopenny curse wouldn't do what was done, except by a
  miracle. It wouldn't make Wynd disappear like a fairy. It wouldn't make him
  reappear a quarter of a mile away with a rope round his neck.'</p>

  <p>'No,' said Father Brown sharply; 'but what would it do?'</p>

  <p>'And still I don't follow you,' said the millionaire gravely.</p>

  <p>'I say, what would it do?' repeated the priest; showing, for the first
  time, a sort of animation verging on annoyance. 'You keep on repeating that a
  blank pistol-shot wouldn't do this and wouldn't do that; that if that was
  all, the murder wouldn't happen or the miracle wouldn't happen. It doesn't
  seem to occur to you to ask what would happen. What would happen to you if a
  lunatic let off a firearm without rhyme or reason right under your window?
  What's the very first thing that would happen?'</p>

  <p>Vandam looked thoughtful. 'I guess I should look out of the window,' he
  said.</p>

  <p>'Yes,' said Father Brown, 'you'd look out of the window. That's the whole
  story. It's a sad story, but it's finished now; and there were extenuating
  circumstances.'</p>

  <p>'Why should looking out of the window hurt him?' asked Alboin. 'He didn't
  fall out, or he'd have been found in the lane.'</p>

  <p>'No,' said Father Brown, in a low voice. 'He didn't fall. He rose.'</p>

  <p>There was something in his voice like the groan of a gong, a note of doom,
  but otherwise he went on steadily: 'He rose, but not on wings; not on the
  wings of any holy or unholy angels. He rose at the end of a rope, exactly as
  you saw him in the garden; a noose dropped over his head the moment it was
  poked out of the window. Don't you remember Wilson, that big servant of his,
  a man of huge strength, while Wynd was the lightest of little shrimps? Didn't
  Wilson go to the floor above to get a pamphlet, to a room full of luggage
  corded in coils and coils of rope? Has Wilson been seen since that day? I
  fancy not.'</p>

  <p>'Do you mean,' asked the secretary, 'that Wilson whisked him clean out of
  his own window like a trout on a line?'</p>

  <p>'Yes,' said the other, 'and let him down again out of the other window
  into the park, where the third accomplice hooked him on to a tree. Remember
  the lane was always empty; remember the wall opposite was quite blank;
  remember it was all over in five minutes after the Irishman gave the signal
  with the pistol. There were three of them in it of course; and I wonder
  whether you can all guess who they were.'</p>

  <p>They were all three staring at the plain, square window and the blank,
  white wall beyond; and nobody answered.</p>

  <p>'By the way,' went on Father Brown, 'don't think I blame you for jumping
  to preternatural conclusions. The reason's very simple, really. You all swore
  you were hard-shelled materialists; and as a matter of fact you were all
  balanced on the very edge of belief&mdash;of belief in almost anything. There
  are thousands balanced on it today; but it's a sharp, uncomfortable edge to
  sit on. You won't rest till you believe something; that's why Mr Vandam went
  through new religions with a tooth-comb, and Mr Alboin quotes Scripture for
  his religion of breathing exercises, and Mr Fenner grumbles at the very God
  he denies. That's where you all split; it's natural to believe in the
  supernatural. It never feels natural to accept only natural things. But
  though it wanted only a touch to tip you into preternaturalism about these
  things, these things really were only natural things. They were not only
  natural, they were almost unnaturally simple. I suppose there never was quite
  so simple a story as this.'</p>

  <p>Fenner laughed and then looked puzzled. 'I don't understand one thing,' he
  said. 'If it was Wilson, how did Wynd come to have a man like that on such
  intimate terms? How did he come to be killed by a man he'd seen every day for
  years? He was famous as being a judge of men.'</p>

  <p>Father Brown thumped his umbrella on the ground with an emphasis he rarely
  showed.</p>

  <p>'Yes,' he said, almost fiercely; 'that was how he came to be killed. He
  was killed for just that. He was killed for being a judge of men.'</p>

  <p>They all stared at him, but he went on, almost as if they were not
  there.</p>

  <p>'What is any man that he should be a judge of men?' he demanded. 'These
  three were the tramps that once stood before him and were dismissed rapidly
  right and left to one place or another; as if for them there were no cloak of
  courtesy, no stages of intimacy, no free-will in friendship. And twenty years
  has not exhausted the indignation born of that unfathomable insult in that
  moment when he dared to know them at a glance.'</p>

  <p>'Yes,' said the secretary; 'I understand ... and I understand how it is
  that you understand&mdash;all sorts of things.'</p>

  <p>'Well, I'm blamed if I understand,' cried the breezy Western gentleman
  boisterously. 'Your Wilson and your Irishman seem to be just a couple of
  cut-throat murderers who killed their benefactor. I've no use for a black and
  bloody assassin of that sort, in my morality, whether it's religion or
  not.'</p>

  <p>'He was a black and bloody assassin, no doubt,' said Fenner quietly. 'I'm
  not defending him; but I suppose it's Father Brown's business to pray for all
  men, even for a man like&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Yes,' assented Father Brown, 'it's my business to pray for all men, even
  for a man like Warren Wynd.'</p>

  <h2><a id="story5"
     name="story5">V.&mdash;THE CURSE OF THE GOLDEN CROSS</a></h2>

<h3>First published in <i>Nash's Magazine</i>, May 1925</h3>

  <p class="first">Six people sat around a small table, seeming almost as
  incongruous and accidental as if they had been shipwrecked separately on the
  same small desert island. At least the sea surrounded them; for in one sense
  their island was enclosed in another island, a large and flying island like
  Laputa. For the little table was one of many little tables dotted about in
  the dining saloon of that monstrous ship the Moravia, speeding through the
  night and the everlasting emptiness of the Atlantic. The little company had
  nothing in common except that all were travelling from America to England.
  Two of them at least might be called celebrities; others might be called
  obscure, and in one or two cases even dubious.</p>

  <p>The first was the famous Professor Smaill, an authority on certain
  archaeological studies touching the later Byzantine Empire. His lectures,
  delivered in an American University, were accepted as of the first authority
  even in the most authoritative seats of learning in Europe. His literary
  works were so steeped in a mellow and imaginative sympathy with the European
  past, that it often gave strangers a start to hear him speak with an American
  accent. Yet he was, in his way, very American; he had long fair hair brushed
  back from a big square forehead, long straight features and a curious mixture
  of preoccupation with a poise of potential swiftness, like a lion pondering
  absent-mindedly on his next leap.</p>

  <p>There was only one lady in the group; and she was (as the journalists
  often said of her) a host in herself; being quite prepared to play hostess,
  not to say empress, at that or any other table. She was Lady Diana Wales, the
  celebrated lady traveller in tropical and other countries; but there was
  nothing rugged or masculine about her appearance at dinner. She was herself
  handsome in an almost tropical fashion, with a mass of hot and heavy red
  hair; she was dressed in what the journalists call a daring fashion, but her
  face was intelligent and her eyes had that bright and rather prominent
  appearance which belongs to the eyes of ladies who ask questions at political
  meetings.</p>

  <p>The other four figures seemed at first like shadows in this shining
  presence; but they showed differences on a close view. One of them was a
  young man entered on the ship's register as Paul T. Tarrant. He was an
  American type which might be more truly called an American antitype. Every
  nation probably has an antitype; a sort of extreme exception that proves the
  national rule. Americans really respect work, rather as Europeans respect
  war. There is a halo of heroism about it; and he who shrinks from it is less
  than a man. The antitype is evident through being exceedingly rare. He is the
  dandy or dude: the wealthy waster who makes a weak villain for so many
  American novels. Paul Tarrant seemed to have nothing whatever to do but
  change his clothes, which he did about six times a day; passing into paler or
  richer shades of his suit of exquisite light grey, like the delicate silver
  changes of the twilight. Unlike most Americans, he cultivated very carefully
  a short, curly beard; and unlike most dandies, even of his own type, he
  seemed rather sulky than showy. Perhaps there was something almost Byronic
  about his silence and his gloom.</p>

  <p>The next two travellers were naturally classed together; merely because
  they were both English lecturers returning from an American tour. One of them
  was described as Leonard Smyth, apparently a minor poet, but something of a
  major journalist; long-headed, light-haired, perfectly dressed, and perfectly
  capable of looking after himself. The other was a rather comic contrast,
  being short and broad, with a black, walrus moustache, and as taciturn as the
  other was talkative. But as he had been both charged with robbing and praised
  for rescuing a Roumanian Princess threatened by a jaguar in his travelling
  menagerie, and had thus figured in a fashionable case, it was naturally felt
  that his views on God, progress, his own early life, and the future of
  Anglo-American relations would be of great interest and value to the
  inhabitants of Minneapolis and Omaha. The sixth and most insignificant figure
  was that of a little English priest going by the name of Brown. He listened
  to the conversation with respectful attention, and he was at that moment
  forming the impression that there was one rather curious thing about it.</p>

  <p>'I suppose those Byzantine studies of yours, Professor,' Leonard Smyth was
  saying, 'would throw some light on this story of a tomb found somewhere on
  the south coast; near Brighton, isn't it? Brighton's a long way from
  Byzantium, of course. But I read something about the style of burying or
  embalming or something being supposed to be Byzantine.'</p>

  <p>'Byzantine studies certainly have to reach a long way,' replied the
  Professor dryly. 'They talk about specialists; but I think the hardest thing
  on earth is to specialize. In this case, for instance: how can a man know
  anything about Byzantium till he knows everything about Rome before it and
  about Islam after it? Most Arab arts were old Byzantine arts. Why, take
  algebra&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'But I won't take algebra,' cried the lady decisively. 'I never did, and I
  never do. But I'm awfully interested in embalming. I was with Gatton, you
  know, when he opened the Babylonian tombs. Ever since then I found mummies
  and preserved bodies and all that perfectly thrilling. Do tell us about this
  one.'</p>

  <p>'Gatton was an interesting man,' said the Professor. 'They were an
  interesting family. That brother of his who went into Parliament was much
  more than an ordinary politician. I never understood the Fascisti till he
  made that speech about Italy.'</p>

  <p>'Well, we're not going to Italy on this trip,' said Lady Diana
  persistently, 'and I believe you're going to that little place where they've
  found the tomb. In Sussex, isn't it?'</p>

  <p>'Sussex is pretty large, as these little English sections go,' replied the
  Professor. 'One might wander about in it for a goodish time; and it's a good
  place to wander in. It's wonderful how large those low hills seem when you're
  on them.'</p>

  <p>There was an abrupt accidental silence; and then the lady said, 'Oh, I'm
  going on deck,' and rose, the men rising with her. But the Professor lingered
  and the little priest was the last to leave the table, carefully folding up
  his napkin. And as they were thus left alone together the Professor said
  suddenly to his companion:</p>

  <p>'What would you say was the point of that little talk?'</p>

  <p>'Well,' said Father Brown, smiling, 'since you ask me, there was something
  that amused me a little. I may be wrong; but it seemed to me that the company
  made three attempts to get you to talk about an embalmed body said to be
  found in Sussex. And you, on your side, very courteously offered to
  talk&mdash;first about algebra, and then about the Fascisti, and then about
  the landscape of the Downs.'</p>

  <p>'In short,' replied the Professor, 'you thought I was ready to talk about
  any subject but that one. You were quite right.'</p>

  <p>The Professor was silent for a little time, looking down at the
  tablecloth; then he looked up and spoke with that swift impulsiveness that
  suggested the lion's leap.</p>

  <p>'See here. Father Brown,' he said, 'I consider you about wisest and
  whitest man I ever met.'</p>

  <p>Father Brown was very English. He had all the normal nation helplessness
  about what to do with a serious and sincere compliment suddenly handed to him
  to his face in the American manner. His reply was a meaningless murmur; and
  it was the Professor who proceeded, with the same staccato earnestness: 'You
  see, up to a point it's all simple enough. A Christian tomb of the Dark Ages,
  apparently that of a bishop, has been found under a little church at Dulham
  on the Sussex coast. The Vicar happens to be a good bit of an archaeologist
  himself and has been able to find a good deal more than I know yet. There was
  a rumour of the corpse being embalmed in a way peculiar to Greeks and
  Egyptians but unknown in the West, especially at that date. So Mr Walters
  (that is the Vicar) naturally wonders about Byzantine influences. But he also
  mentions something else, that is of even more personal interest to me.'</p>

  <p>His long grave face seemed to grow even longer and graver as he frowned
  down at the tablecloth. His long finger seemed to be tracing patterns on it
  like the plans of dead cities and their temples and tombs.</p>

  <p>'So I'm going to tell you, and nobody else, why it is I have to be careful
  about mentioning that matter in mixed company; and why, the more eager they
  are to talk about it, the more cautious I have to be. It is also stated that
  in the coffin is a chain with a cross, common enough to look at, but with a
  certain secret symbol on the back found on only one other cross in the world.
  It is from the arcana of the very earliest Church, and is supposed to
  indicate St Peter setting up his See at Antioch before he came to Rome.
  Anyhow, I believe there is but one other like it, and it belongs to me. I
  hear there is some story about a curse on it; but I take no notice of that.
  But whether or no there is a curse, there really is, in one sense, a
  conspiracy; though the conspiracy should only consist of one man.'</p>

  <p>'Of one man?' repeated Father Brown almost mechanically.</p>

  <p>'Of one madman, for all I know,' said Professor Smaill. 'It's a long story
  and in some ways a silly one.'</p>

  <p>He paused again, tracing plans like architectural drawings with his finger
  on the cloth, and then resumed: 'Perhaps I had better tell you about it from
  the beginning, in case you see some little point in the story that is
  meaningless to me. It began years and years ago, when I was conducting some
  investigations on my own account in the antiquities of Crete and the Greek
  islands. I did a great deal of it practically single-handed; sometimes with
  the most rude and temporary help from the inhabitants of the place, and
  sometimes literally alone. It was under the latter circumstances that I found
  a maze of subterranean passages which led at last to a heap of rich refuse,
  broken ornaments and scattered gems which I took to be the ruins of some
  sunken altar, and in which I found the curious gold cross. I turned it over,
  and on the back of it I saw the Ichthus or fish, which was an early Christian
  symbol, but of a shape and pattern rather different from that commonly found;
  and, as it seemed to me, more realistic&mdash;more as if the archaic designer
  had meant it to be not merely a conventional enclosure or nimbus, but to look
  a little more like a real fish. It seemed to me that there was a flattening
  towards one end of it that was not like mere mathematical decoration, but
  rather like a sort of rude or even savage zoology.</p>

  <p>'In order to explain very briefly why I thought this find important, I
  must tell you the point of the excavation. For one thing, it had something of
  the nature of an excavation of an excavation. We were on the track not only
  of antiquities, but of the antiquarians of antiquity. We had reason to
  believe, or some of us thought we had reason to believe, that these
  underground passages, mostly of the Minoan period, like that famous one which
  is actually identified with the labyrinth of the Minotaur, had not really
  been lost and left undisturbed for all the ages between the Minotaur and the
  modern explorer. We believed that these underground places, I might almost
  say these underground towns and villages, had already been penetrated during
  the intervening period by some persons prompted by some motive. About the
  motive there were different schools of thought: some holding that the
  Emperors had ordered an official exploration out of mere scientific
  curiosity; others that the furious fashion in the later Roman Empire for all
  sorts of lurid Asiatic superstitions had started some nameless Manichaean
  sect or other rioting in the caverns in orgies that had to be hidden from the
  face of the sun. I belong to the group which believed that these caverns had
  been used in the same way as the catacombs. That is, we believed that, during
  some of the persecutions which spread like a fire over the whole Empire, the
  Christians had concealed themselves in these ancient pagan labyrinths of
  stone. It was therefore with a thrill as sharp I as a thunderclap that I
  found and picked up the fallen golden cross and saw the design upon it; and
  it was with still more of a shock of felicity that, on turning to make my way
  once more outwards and upwards into the light of day, I looked up at the
  walls of bare rock that extended endlessly along the low passages, and saw
  scratched in yet ruder outline, but if possible more unmistakable, the shape
  of the Fish.</p>

  <p>'Something about it made it seem as if it might be a fossil fish or some
  rudimentary organism fixed for ever in a frozen sea. I could not analyse this
  analogy, otherwise unconnected with a mere drawing scratched upon the stone,
  till I realized that I was saying in my sub-conscious mind that the first
  Christians must have seemed something like fish, dumb and dwelling in a
  fallen world of twilight and silence, dropped far below the feet of men and
  moving in dark and twilight and a soundless world.</p>

  <p>'Everyone walking along stone passages knows what it is to be followed by
  phantom feet. The echo follows flapping or clapping behind or in front, so
  that it is almost impossible for the man who is really lonely to believe in
  his loneliness. I had got used to the effects of this echo and had not
  noticed it much for some time past, when I caught sight of the symbolical
  shape scrawled on the wall of rock. I stopped, and at the same instant it
  seemed as if my heart stopped, too; for my own feet had halted, but the echo
  went marching on.</p>

  <p>'I ran forward, and it seemed as if the ghostly footsteps ran also, but
  not with that exact imitation which marks the material reverberation of a
  sound. I stopped again, and the steps stopped also; but I could have sworn
  they stopped an instant too late; I called out a question; and my cry was
  answered; but the voice was not my own.</p>

  <p>'It came round the corner of a rock just in front of me; and throughout
  that uncanny chase I noticed that it was always at some such angle of the
  crooked path that it paused and spoke. The little space in front of me that
  could be illuminated by my small electric torch was always as empty as an
  empty room. Under these conditions I had a conversation with I know not whom,
  which lasted all the way to the first white gleam of daylight, and even there
  I could not see in what fashion he vanished into the light of day. But the
  mouth of the labyrinth was full of many openings and cracks and chasms, and
  it would not have been difficult for him to have somehow darted back and
  disappeared again into the underworld of the caves. I only know that I came
  out on the lonely steps of a great mountain like a marble terrace, varied
  only with a green vegetation that seemed somehow more tropical than the
  purity of the rock, like the Oriental invasion that has spread sporadically
  over the fall of classic Hellas. I looked out on a sea of stainless blue, and
  the sun shone steadily on utter loneliness and silence; and there was not a
  blade of grass stirred with a whisper of flight nor the shadow of a shadow of
  man.</p>

  <p>'It had been a terrible conversation; so intimate and so individual and in
  a sense so casual. This being, bodiless, faceless, nameless and yet calling
  me by my name, had talked to me in those crypts and cracks where we were
  buried alive with no more passion or melodrama than if we had been sitting in
  two armchairs at a club. But he had told me also that he would unquestionably
  kill me or any other man who came into the possession of the cross with the
  mark of the fish. He told me frankly he was not fool enough to attack me
  there in the labyrinth, knowing I had a loaded revolver, and that he ran as
  much risk as I. But he told me, equally calmly, that he would plan my murder
  with the certainty of success, with every detail developed and every danger
  warded off, with the sort of artistic perfection that a Chinese craftsman or
  an Indian embroiderer gives to the artistic work of a life-time. Yet he was
  no Oriental; I am certain be was a white man. I suspect that he was a
  countryman of my own.</p>

  <p>'Since then I have received from time to time signs and symbols and queer
  impersonal messages that have made me certain, at least, that if the man is a
  maniac he is a monomaniac. He is always telling me, in this airy and detached
  way, that the preparations for my death and burial are proceeding
  satisfactorily; and that the only way in which I can prevent their being
  crowned with a comfortable success is to give up the relic in my
  possession&mdash;the unique cross that I found in the cavern. He does not
  seem to have any religious sentiment or fanaticism on the point; he seems to
  have no passion but the passion of a collector of curiosities. That is one of
  the things that makes me feel sure he is a man of the West and not of the
  East. But this particular curiosity seems to have driven him quite crazy.</p>

  <p>'And then came this report, as yet unsubstantiated, about the duplicate
  relic found on an embalmed body in a Sussex tomb. If he had been a maniac
  before, this news turned him into a demoniac possessed of seven devils. That
  there should be one of them belonging to another man was bad enough, but that
  there should be two of them and neither belonging to him was a torture not to
  be borne. His mad messages began to come thick and fast like showers of
  poisoned arrows, and each cried out more confidently than the last that death
  would strike me at the moment when I stretched out my unworthy hand towards
  the cross in the tomb.</p>

  <p>''You will never know me,' he wrote, 'you will never say my name; you will
  never see my face; you will die, and never know who has killed you. I may be
  in any form among those about you; but I shall be in that alone at which you
  have forgotten to look.'</p>

  <p>'From those threats I deduce that he is quite likely to shadow me on this
  expedition; and try to steal the relic or do me some mischief for possessing
  it. But as I never saw the man in my life, he may be almost any man I meet.
  Logically speaking, he may be any of the waiters who wait on me at table. He
  may be any of the passengers who sit with me at table.'</p>

  <p>'He may be me,' said Father Brown, with cheerful contempt for grammar.</p>

  <p>'He may be anybody else,' answered Smaill seriously. 'That is what I meant
  by what I said just now. You are the only man I feel sure is not the
  enemy.'</p>

  <p>Father Brown again looked embarrassed; then he smiled and said: 'Well,
  oddly enough, I'm not. What we have to consider is any chance of finding out
  if he really is here before he&mdash;before he makes himself unpleasant.'</p>

  <p>'There is one chance of finding out, I think,' remarked the Professor
  rather grimly. 'When we get to Southampton I shall take a car at once along
  the coast; I should be glad if you would come with me, but in the ordinary
  sense, of course, our little party will break up. If any one of them turns up
  again in that little churchyard on the Sussex coast, we shall know who he
  really is.'</p>

  <p>The Professor's programme was duly carried out, at least to the extent of
  the car and its cargo in the form of Father Brown. They coasted along the
  road with the sea on one side and the hills of Hampshire and Sussex on the
  other; nor was there visible to the eye any shadow of pursuit. As they
  approached the village of Dulham only one man crossed their path who had any
  connexion with the matter in hand; a journalist who had just visited the
  church and been courteously escorted by the vicar through the new excavated
  chapel; but his remarks and notes seemed to be of the ordinary newspaper
  sort. But Professor Smaill was perhaps a little fanciful, and could not
  dismiss the sense of something odd and discouraging in the attitude and
  appearance of the man, who was tall and shabby, hook-nosed and hollow-eyed,
  with moustaches that drooped with depression. He seemed anything but
  enlivened by his late experiment as a sightseer; indeed, he seemed to be
  striding as fast as possible from the sight, when they stopped him with a
  question.</p>

  <p>'It's all about a curse,' he said; 'a curse on the place, according to the
  guide-book or the parson, or the oldest inhabitant or whoever is the
  authority; and really, it feels jolly like it. Curse or curse, I'm glad to
  have got out of it.'</p>

  <p>'Do you believe in curses?' asked Smaill curiously.</p>

  <p>'I don't believe in anything; I'm a journalist,' answered the melancholy
  being&mdash;'Boon, of the Daily Wire. But there's a some-thing creepy about
  that crypt; and I'll never deny I felt a chill.' And he strode on towards the
  railway station with a further accelerated pace.</p>

  <p>'Looks like a raven or a crow, that fellow,' observed Smaill as they
  turned towards the churchyard. 'What is it they say about a bird of ill
  omen?'</p>

  <p>They entered the churchyard slowly, the eyes of the American antiquary
  lingering luxuriantly over the isolated roof of the lynch-gate and the large
  unfathomable black growth of the yew looking like night itself defying the
  broad daylight. The path climbed up amid heaving levels of turf in which the
  gravestones were tilted at all angles like stone rafts tossed on a green sea,
  till it came to the ridge beyond which the great sea itself ran like an iron
  bar, with pale lights in it like steel. Almost at their feet the tough rank
  grass turned into a tuft of sea-holly and ended in grey and yellow sand;
  and a foot or two from the holly, and outlined darkly against the steely sea,
  stood a motionless figure. But for its dark-grey clothing it might almost
  have been the statue on some sepulchral monument. But Father Brown instantly
  recognized something in the elegant stoop of the shoulders and the rather
  sullen outward thrust of the short beard.</p>

  <p>'Gee!' exclaimed the professor of archaeology; 'it's that man Tarrant, if
  you call him a man. Did you think, when I spoke on the boat, that I should
  ever get so quick an answer to my question?'</p>

  <p>'I thought you might get too many answers to it,' answered Father
  Brown.</p>

  <p>'Why, how do you mean?' inquired the Professor, darting a look at him over
  his shoulder.</p>

  <p>'I mean,' answered the other mildly, 'that I thought I heard voices behind
  the yew-tree. I don't think Mr Tarrant is so solitary as he looks; I might
  even venture to say, so solitary as he likes to look.'</p>

  <p>Even as Tarrant turned slowly round in his moody manner, the confirmation
  came. Another voice, high and rather hard, but none the less feminine, was
  saying with experienced raillery: 'And how was I to know he would be here?'
  It was borne in upon Professor Smaill that this gay observation was not
  addressed to him; so he was forced to conclude in some bewilderment, that yet
  a third person was present. As Lady Diana Wales came out, radiant and
  resolute as ever, from the shadow of the yew, he noted grimly that she had a
  living shadow of her own. The lean dapper figure of Leonard Smyth, that
  insinuating man of letters, appeared immediately behind her own flamboyant
  form, smiling, his head a little on one side like a dog's.</p>

  <p>'Snakes!' muttered Smaill; 'why, they're all here! Or all except that
  little showman with the walrus whiskers.'</p>

  <p>He heard Father Brown laughing softly beside him; and indeed the situation
  was becoming something more than laughable. It seemed to be turning
  topsy-turvy and tumbling about their ears like a pantomime trick; for even
  while the Professor had been speaking, his words had received the most
  comical contradiction. The round head with the grotesque black crescent of
  moustache had appeared suddenly and seemingly out of a hole in the ground. An
  instant afterwards they realized that the hole was in fact a very large hole,
  leading to a ladder which descended into the bowels of the earth; that it was
  in fact the entrance to the subterranean scene they had come to visit. The
  little man had been the first to find the entrance and had already descended
  a rung or two of the ladder before he put his head out again to address his
  fellow-travellers. He looked like some particularly preposterous Grave-digger
  in a burlesque of Hamlet. He only said thickly behind his thick moustaches,
  'It is down here.' But it came to the rest of the company with a start of
  realization that, though they had sat opposite him at meal-times for a week,
  they had hardly ever heard him speak before; and that though he was supposed
  to be an English lecturer, he spoke with a rather occult foreign accent.</p>

  <p>'You see, my dear Professor,' cried Lady Diana with trenchant
  cheerfulness, 'your Byzantine mummy was simply too exciting to be missed. I
  simply had to come along and see it; and I'm sure the gentlemen felt just the
  same. Now you must tell us all about it.'</p>

  <p>'I do not know all about it,' said the Professor gravely, not to say
  grimly, 'In some respects I don't even know what it's all about. It certainly
  seems odd that we should have all met again so soon, but I suppose there are
  no limits to the modern thirst for information. But if we are all to visit
  the place it must be done in a responsible way and, if you will forgive me,
  under responsible leadership. We must notify whoever is in charge of the
  excavations; we shall probably at least have to put our names in a book.'</p>

  <p>Something rather like a wrangle followed on this collision between the
  impatience of the lady and the suspicions of the archaeologist; but the
  latter's insistence on the official rights of the Vicar and the local
  investigation ultimately prevailed; the little man with the moustaches came
  reluctantly out of his grave again and silently acquiesced in a less
  impetuous descent. Fortunately, the clergyman himself appeared at this
  stage&mdash;a grey-haired, good-looking gentleman with a droop accentuated by
  doublet eyeglasses; and while rapidly establishing sympathetic relations with
  the Professor as a fellow-antiquarian, he did not seem to regard his rather
  motley group of companions with anything more hostile than amusement.</p>

  <p>'I hope you are none of you superstitious,' he said pleasantly. 'I ought
  to tell you, to start with, that there are supposed to be all sorts of bad
  omens and curses hanging over our devoted heads in this business. I have just
  been deciphering a Latin inscription which was found over the entrance to the
  chapel; and it would seem that there are no less than three curses involved;
  a curse for entering the sealed chamber, a double curse for opening the
  coffin, and a triple and most terrible curse for touching the gold relic
  found inside it. The two first maledictions I have already incurred myself,'
  he added with a smile; 'but I fear that even you will have to incur the first
  and mildest of them if you are to see anything at all. According to the
  story, the curses descend in a rather lingering fashion, at long intervals
  and on later occasions. I don't know whether that is any comfort to you.' And
  the Reverend Mr Walters smiled once more in his drooping and benevolent
  manner.</p>

  <p>'Story,' repeated Professor Smaill, 'why, what story is that?'</p>

  <p>'It is rather a long story and varies, like other local legends,' answered
  the Vicar. 'But it is undoubtedly contemporary with the time of the tomb; and
  the substance of it is embodied in the inscription and is roughly this: Guy
  de Gisors, a lord of the manor here early in the thirteenth century, had set
  his heart on a beautiful black horse in the possession of an envoy from
  Genoa, which that practical merchant prince would not sell except for a huge
  price. Guy was driven by avarice to the crime of pillaging the shrine and,
  according to one story, even killing the bishop, who was then resident there.
  Anyhow, the bishop uttered a curse which was to fall on anybody who should
  continue to withhold the gold cross from its resting-place in his tomb, or
  should take steps to disturb it when it had returned there. The feudal lord
  raised the money for the horse by selling the gold relic to a goldsmith in
  the town; but on the first day he mounted the horse the animal reared and
  threw him in front of the church porch, breaking his neck. Meanwhile the
  goldsmith, hitherto wealthy and prosperous, was ruined by a series of
  inexplicable accidents, and fell into the power of a Jew money-lender living
  in the manor. Eventually the unfortunate goldsmith, faced with nothing but
  starvation, hanged himself on an apple-tree. The gold cross with all his
  other goods, his house, shop, and tools, had long ago passed into the
  possession of the money-lender. Meanwhile, the son and heir of the feudal
  lord, shocked by the judgement on his blasphemous sire, had become a
  religious devotee in the dark and stern spirit of those times, and conceived
  it his duty to persecute all heresy and unbelief among his vassals. Thus the
  Jew, in his turn, who had been cynically tolerated by the father, was
  ruthlessly burnt by order of the son; so that he, in his turn, suffered for
  the possession of the relic; and after these three judgements, it was
  returned to the bishop's tomb; since when no eye has seen and no hand has
  touched it.'</p>

  <p>Lady Diana Wales seemed to be more impressed than might have been
  expected. 'It really gives one rather a shiver,' she said, 'to think that we
  are going to be the first, except the vicar.'</p>

  <p>The pioneer with the big moustaches and the broken English did not descend
  after all by his favourite ladder, which indeed had only been used by some of
  the workmen conducting the excavation; for the clergyman led them round to a
  larger and more convenient entrance about a hundred yards away, out of which
  he himself had just emerged from his investigations underground. Here the
  descent was by a fairly gradual slope with no difficulties save the
  increasing darkness; for they soon found themselves moving in single file
  down a tunnel as black as pitch, and it was some little time before they saw
  a glimmer of light ahead of them. Once during that silent march there was a
  sound like a catch in somebody's breath, it was impossible to say whose; and
  once there was an oath like a dull explosion, and it was in an unknown
  tongue.</p>

  <p>They came out in a circular chamber like a basilica in a ring of round
  arches; for that chapel had been built before the first pointed arch of the
  Gothic had pierced our civilization like a spear. A glimmer of greenish light
  between some of the pillars marked the place of the other opening into the
  world above, and gave a vague sense of being under the sea, which was
  intensified by one or two other incidental and perhaps fanciful resemblances.
  For the dog-tooth pattern of the Norman was faintly traceable round all the
  arches, giving them, above the cavernous darkness, something of the look of
  the mouths of monstrous sharks. And in the centre the dark bulk of the tomb
  itself, with its lifted lid of stone, might almost have been the jaws of some
  such leviathan.</p>

  <p>Whether out of the sense of fitness or from the lack of more modern
  appliances, the clerical antiquary had arranged for the illumination of the
  chapel only by four tall candles in big wooden candlesticks standing on the
  floor. Of these only one was alight when they entered, casting a faint
  glimmer over the mighty architectural forms. When they had all assembled, the
  clergyman proceeded to light the three others, and the appearance and
  contents of the great sarcophagus came more clearly into view.</p>

  <p>All eyes went first to the face of the dead, preserved across all those
  ages in the lines of life by some secret Eastern process, it was said,
  inherited from heathen antiquity and unknown to the simple graveyards of our
  own island. The Professor could hardly repress an exclamation of wonder; for,
  though the face was as pale as a mask of wax, it looked otherwise like a
  sleeping man, who had but that moment closed his eyes. The face was of the
  ascetic, perhaps even the fanatical type, with a high framework of bones; the
  figure was clad in a golden cope and gorgeous vestments, and high up on the
  breast, at the base of the throat, glittered the famous gold cross upon a
  short gold chain, or rather necklace. The stone coffin had been opened by
  lifting the lid of it at the head and propping it aloft upon two strong
  wooden shafts or poles, hitched above under the edge of the upper slab and
  wedged below into the corners of the coffin behind the head of the corpse.
  Less could therefore be seen of the feet or the lower part of the figure, but
  the candle-light shone full on the face; and in contrast with its tones of
  dead ivory the cross of gold seemed to stir and sparkle like a fire.</p>

  <p>Professor Smaill's big forehead had carried a big furrow of reflection, or
  possibly of worry, ever since the clergyman had told the story of the curse.
  But feminine intuition, not untouched by feminine hysteria, understood the
  meaning of his brooding immobility better than did the men around him. In the
  silence of that candle-lit cavern Lady Diana cried out suddenly: 'Don't touch
  it, I tell you!'</p>

  <p>But the man had already made one of his swift leonine movements, leaning
  forward over the body. The next instant they all darted, some forward and
  some backward, but all with a dreadful ducking motion as if the sky were
  falling.</p>

  <p>As the Professor laid a finger on the gold cross, the wooden props, that
  bent very slightly in supporting the lifted lid of stone, seemed to jump and
  straighten themselves with a jerk. The lip of the stone slab slipped from its
  wooden perch; and in all their souls and stomachs came a sickening sense of
  down-rushing ruin, as if they had all been flung off a precipice. Smaill had
  withdrawn his head swiftly, but not in time; and he lay senseless beside the
  coffin, in a red puddle of blood from scalp or skull. And the old stone
  coffin was once more closed as it had been for centuries; save that one or
  two sticks or splinters stuck in the crevice, horribly suggestive of bones
  crunched by an ogre. The leviathan had snapped its jaws of stone.</p>

  <p>Lady Diana was looking at the wreck with eyes that had an electric glare
  as of lunacy; her red hair looked scarlet against the pallor of her face in
  the greenish twilight. Smyth was looking at her, still with something
  dog-like in the turn of his head; but it was the expression of a god who
  looks at a master whose catastrophe he can only partly understand. Tarrant
  and the foreigner had stiffened in their usual sullen attitudes, but their
  faces had turned the colour of clay. The Vicar seemed to have fainted. Father
  Brown was kneeling beside the fallen figure, trying to test its
  condition.</p>

  <p>Rather to the general surprise, the Byronic lounger, Paul Tarrant, came
  forward to help him.</p>

  <p>'He'd better be carried up into the air,' he said. 'I suppose there's just
  a chance for him.'</p>

  <p>'He isn't dead,' said Father Brown in a low voice, 'but I think it's
  pretty bad; you aren't a doctor by any chance?'</p>

  <p>'No; but I've had to pick up a good many things in my time,' said the
  other. 'But never mind about me just now. My real profession would probably
  surprise you.'</p>

  <p>'I don't think so,' replied Father Brown, with a slight smile. 'I thought
  of it about halfway through the voyage. You are a detective shadowing
  somebody. Well, the cross is safe from thieves now, anyhow.'</p>

  <p>While they were speaking Tarrant had lifted the frail figure of the fallen
  man with easy strength and dexterity, and was carefully carrying him towards
  the exit. He answered over his shoulder:</p>

  <p>'Yes, the cross is safe enough.'</p>

  <p>'You mean that nobody else is,' replied Brown. 'Are you thinking of the
  curse, too?'</p>

  <p>Father Brown went about for the next hour or two under a burden of
  frowning perplexity that was something beyond the shock of the tragic
  accident. He assisted in carrying the victim to the little inn opposite the
  church, interviewed the doctor, who reported the injury as serious and
  threatening, though not certainly fatal, and carried the news to the little
  group of travellers who had gathered round the table in the inn parlour. But
  whereever he went the cloud of mystification rested on him and seemed to grow
  darker the more deeply he pondered. For the central mystery was growing more
  and more mysterious, actually in proportion as many of the minor mysteries
  began to clear themselves up in his mind. Exactly in proportion as the
  meaning of individual figures in that motley group began to explain itself,
  the thing that had happened grew more and more difficult to explain. Leonard
  Smyth had come merely because Lady Diana had come; and Lady Diana had come
  merely because she chose. They were engaged in one of those floating Society
  flirtations that are all the more silly for being semi-intellectual. But the
  lady's romanticism had a superstitious side to it; and she was pretty well
  prostrated by the terrible end of her adventure. Paul Tarrant was a private
  detective, possibly watching the flirtation, for some wife or husband;
  possibly shadowing the foreign lecturer with the moustaches, who had much the
  air of an undesirable alien. But if he or anybody else had intended to steal
  the relic, the intention had been finally frustrated. And to all mortal
  appearance, what had frustrated it was either an incredible coincidence or
  the intervention of the ancient curse.</p>

  <p>As he stood in unusual perplexity in the middle of the village street,
  between the inn and the church, he felt a mild shock of surprise at seeing a
  recently familiar but rather unexpected figure advancing up the street. Mr
  Boon, the journalist, looking very haggard in the sunshine, which showed up
  his shabby raiment like that of a scarecrow, had his dark and deep-set eyes
  (rather close together on either side of the long drooping nose) fixed on the
  priest. The latter looked twice before he realized that the heavy dark
  moustache hid something like a grin or at least a grim smile.</p>

  <p>'I thought you were going away,' said Father Brown a little sharply. 'I
  thought you left by that train two hours ago.'</p>

  <p>'Well, you see I didn't,' said Boon.</p>

  <p>'Why have you come back?' asked the priest almost sternly.</p>

  <p>'This is not the sort of little rural paradise for a journalist to leave
  in a hurry,' replied the other. 'Things happen too fast here to make it worth
  while to go back to a dull place like London. Besides, they can't keep me out
  of the affair&mdash;I mean this second affair. It was I that found the body,
  or at any rate the clothes. Quite suspicious conduct on my part, wasn't it?
  Perhaps you; think I wanted to dress up in his clothes. Shouldn't I make a
  lovely parson?'</p>

  <p>And the lean and long-nosed mountebank suddenly made an extravagant
  gesture in the middle of the market-place, stretching out his arms and
  spreading out his dark-gloved hands in a sort of burlesque benediction and
  saying: 'Oh, my dear brethren and sisters, for I would embrace you
  all....'</p>

  <p>'What on earth are you talking about?' cried Father Brown, and rapped the
  stones slightly with his stumpy umbrella, for he was a little less patient
  than usual.</p>

  <p>'Oh, you'll find out all about it if you ask that picnic party of yours at
  the inn,' replied Boon scornfully. 'That man Tarrant seems to suspect me
  merely because I found the clothes; though he only came up a minute too late
  to find them himself. But there are all sorts of mysteries in this business.
  The little man with the big moustaches may have more in him than meets the
  eye. For that matter I don't see why you shouldn't have killed the poor
  fellow yourself.'</p>

  <p>Father Brown did not seem in the least annoyed at the suggestion, but he
  seemed exceedingly bothered and bewildered by the remark. 'Do you mean,' he
  asked with simplicity, 'that it was I who tried to kill Professor
  Smaill?'</p>

  <p>'Not at all,' said the other, waving his hand with the air of one making a
  handsome concession. 'Plenty of dead people for you to choose among. Not
  limited to Professor Smaill. Why, didn't you know somebody else had turned
  up, a good deal deader than Professor Smaill? And I don't see why you
  shouldn't have done him in, in a quiet way. Religious differences, you
  know... lamentable disunion of Christendom. ... I suppose you've always
  wanted to get the English parishes back.'</p>

  <p>'I'm going back to the inn,' said the priest quietly; 'you say the people
  there know what you mean, and perhaps they may be able to say it.'</p>

  <p>In truth, just afterwards his private perplexities suffered a momentary
  dispersal at the news of a new calamity. The moment he entered the little
  parlour where the rest of the company were collected, something in their pale
  faces told him they were shaken by something yet more recent than the
  accident at the tomb. Even as he entered, Leonard Smyth was saying:' Where is
  all this going to end?'</p>

  <p>'It will never end, I tell you,' repeated Lady Diana, gazing into vacancy
  with glassy eyes; 'it will never end till we all end. One after another the
  curse will take us; perhaps slowly, as the poor vicar said; but it will take
  us all as it has taken him.'</p>

  <p>'What in the world has happened now?' asked Father Brown.</p>

  <p>There was a silence, and then Tarrant said in a voice that sounded a
  little hollow: 'Mr Walters, the Vicar, has committed suicide. I suppose it
  was the shock unhinged him. But I fear there can be no doubt about it. We've
  just found his black hat and clothes on a rock jutting out from the shore. He
  seems to have jumped into the sea. I thought he looked as if it had knocked
  him half-witted, and perhaps we ought to have looked after him; but there was
  so much to look after.'</p>

  <p>'You could have done nothing,' said the lady. 'Don't you see the thing is
  dealing doom in a sort of dreadful order? The Professor touched the cross,
  and he went first; the Vicar had opened the tomb, and he went second; we only
  entered the chapel, and we&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Hold on,' said Father Brown, in a sharp voice he very seldom used; 'this
  has got to stop.'</p>

  <p>He still wore a heavy though unconscious frown, but in his eyes was no
  longer the cloud of mystification, but a light of almost terrible
  understanding. 'What a fool I am!' he muttered. 'I ought to have seen it long
  ago. The tale of the curse ought to have told me.'</p>

  <p>'Do you mean to say,' demanded Tarrant, 'that we can really be killed now
  by something that happened in the thirteenth century?'</p>

  <p>Father Brown shook his head and answered with quiet emphasis: 'I won't
  discuss whether we can be killed by something that happened in the thirteenth
  century; but I'm jolly certain that we can't be killed by something that
  never happened in the thirteenth century, something that never happened at
  all.'</p>

  <p>'Well,' said Tarrant, 'it's refreshing to find a priest so sceptical of
  the supernatural as all that.'</p>

  <p>'Not at all,' replied the priest calmly; 'it's not the supernatural part I
  doubt. It's the natural part. I'm exactly in the position of the man who
  said, 'I can believe the impossible, but not the improbable.''</p>

  <p>'That's what you call a paradox, isn't it?' asked the other.</p>

  <p>'It's what I call common sense, properly understood,' replied Father
  Brown. 'It really is more natural to believe a preternatural story, that
  deals with things we don't understand, than a natural story that contradicts
  things we do understand. Tell me that the great Mr Gladstone, in his last
  hours, was haunted by the ghost of Parnell, and I will be agnostic about it.
  But tell me that Mr Gladstone, when first presented to Queen Victoria, wore
  his hat in her drawing-room and slapped her on the back and offered her a
  cigar, and I am not agnostic at all. That is not impossible; it's only
  incredible. But I'm much more certain it didn't happen than that Parnell's
  ghost didn't appear; because it violates the laws of the world I do
  understand. So it is with that tale of the curse. It isn't the legend that I
  disbelieve&mdash;it's the history.'</p>

  <p>Lady Diana had recovered a little from her trance of Cassandra, and her
  perennial curiosity about new things began to peer once more out of her
  bright and prominent eyes.</p>

  <p>'What a curious man you are!' she said. 'Why should you disbelieve the
  history?'</p>

  <p>'I disbelieve the history because it isn't history,' answered Father
  Brown. 'To anybody who happens to know a little about the Middle Ages, the
  whole story was about as probable as Gladstone offering Queen Victoria a
  cigar. But does anybody know anything about the Middle Ages? Do you know what
  a Guild was? Have you ever heard of salvo managio suo? Do you know what sort
  of people were Servi Regis?</p>

  <p>'No, of course I don't,' said the lady, rather crossly. 'What a lot of
  Latin words!'</p>

  <p>'No, of course,' said Father Brown. 'If it had been Tutankhamen and a set
  of dried-up Africans preserved, Heaven knows why, at the other end of the
  world; if it had been Babylonia or China; if it had been some race as remote
  and mysterious as the Man in the Moon, your newspapers would have told you
  all about it, down to the last discovery of a tooth-brush or a collar-stud.
  But the men who built your own parish churches, and gave the names to your
  own towns and trades, and the very roads you walk on&mdash;it has never
  occurred to you to know anything about them. I don't claim to know a lot
  myself; but I know enough to see that story is stuff and nonsense from
  beginning to end. It was illegal for a money-lender to distrain on a man's
  shop and tools. It's exceedingly unlikely that the Guild would not have saved
  a man from such utter ruin, especially if he were ruined by a Jew. Those
  people had vices and tragedies of their own; they sometimes tortured and
  burned people. But that idea of a man, without God or hope in the world,
  crawling away to die because nobody cared whether he lived&mdash;that isn't a
  medieval idea. That's a product of our economic science and progress. The Jew
  wouldn't have been a vassal of the feudal lord. The Jews normally had a
  special position as servants of the King. Above all, the Jew couldn't
  possibly have been burned for his religion.'</p>

  <p>'The paradoxes are multiplying,' observed Tarrant; 'but surely , you won't
  deny that Jews were persecuted in the Middle Ages?'</p>

  <p>'It would be nearer the truth,' said Father Brown, 'to say they were the
  only people who weren't persecuted in the Middle Ages. If you want to
  satirize medievalism, you could make a good case by saying that some poor
  Christian might be burned alive for 'making a mistake about the Homoousion,
  while a rich Jew might walk down the street openly sneering at Christ and the
  Mother of God. Well, that's what the story is like. It was never a story of
  the Middle Ages; it was never even a legend about the Middle Ages. It was
  made up by somebody whose notions came from novels and newspapers, and
  probably made up on the spur of the moment.'</p>

  <p>The others seemed a little dazed by the historical digression, and seemed
  to wonder vaguely why the priest emphasized it and made it so important a
  part of the puzzle. But Tarrant, whose trade it was to pick the practical
  detail out of many tangles of digression, had suddenly become alert. His
  bearded chin was thrust forward farther than ever, out his sullen eyes were
  wide awake. 'Ah,' he said; 'made up on the spur of the moment!'</p>

  <p>'Perhaps that is an exaggeration,' admitted Father Brown calmly. 'I should
  rather say made up more casually and carelessly than the rest of an
  uncommonly careful plot. But the plotter did not think the details of
  medieval history would matter much to anybody. And his calculation in a
  general way was pretty nearly right, like most of his other
  calculations.'</p>

  <p>'Whose calculations? Who was right?' demanded the lady with a sudden
  passion of impatience. 'Who is this person you are talking about? Haven't we
  gone through enough, without your making our flesh creep with your he's and
  him's?'</p>

  <p>'I am talking about the murderer,' said Father Brown.</p>

  <p>'What murderer?' she asked sharply. 'Do you mean that the poor Professor
  was murdered?'</p>

  <p>'Well,' said the staring Tarrant gruffly into his beard, 'we can't say
  'murdered', for we don't know he's killed.'</p>

  <p>'The murderer killed somebody else, who was not Professor Smaill,' said
  the priest gravely.</p>

  <p>'Why, whom else could he kill?' asked the other. 'He killed the Reverend
  John Walters, the Vicar of Dulham,' replied Father Brown with precision. 'He
  only wanted to kill those two, because they both had got hold of relics of
  one rare pattern. The murderer was a sort of monomaniac on the point.'</p>

  <p>'It all sounds very strange,' muttered Tarrant. 'Of course we can't swear
  that the Vicar's really dead either. We haven't seen his body.'</p>

  <p>'Oh yes, you have,' said Father Brown.</p>

  <p>There was a silence as sudden as the stroke of a gong; a silence in which
  that sub-conscious guesswork that was so active and accurate in the woman
  moved her almost to a shriek.</p>

  <p>'That is exactly what you have seen,' went on the priest. 'You have seen
  his body. You haven't seen him&mdash;the real living man; but you have seen
  his body all right. You have stared at it hard by the light of four great
  candles; and it was not tossing suicidally in the sea but lying in state like
  a Prince of the Church in a shrine built before the Crusade.'</p>

  <p>'In plain words,' said Tarrant, 'you actually ask us to believe that the
  embalmed body was really the corpse of a murdered man.'</p>

  <p>Father Brown was silent for a moment; then he said almost with an air of
  irrelevance: 'The first thing I noticed about it was the cross; or rather the
  string suspending the cross. Naturally, for most of you, it was only a string
  of beads and nothing else in particular; but, naturally also, it was rather
  more in my line than yours. You remember it lay close up to the chin, with
  only a few beads showing, as if the whole necklet were quite short. But the
  beads that showed were arranged in a special way, first one and then three,
  and so on; in fact, I knew at a glance that it was a rosary, an ordinary
  rosary with a cross at the end of it. But a rosary has at least five decades
  and additional beads as well; and I naturally wondered where all the rest of
  it was. It would go much more than once round the old man's neck. I couldn't
  understand it at the time; and it was only afterwards I guessed where the
  extra length had gone to. It was coiled round and round the foot of the
  wooden prop that was fixed in the corner of the coffin, holding up the lid.
  So that when poor Smaill merely plucked at the cross it jerked the prop out
  of its place and the lid fell on his skull like a club of stone.'</p>

  <p>'By George!' said Tarrant; 'I'm beginning to think there's something in
  what you say. This is a queer story if it's true.'</p>

  <p>'When I realized that,' went on Father Brown, 'I could manage more or less
  to guess the rest. Remember, first of all, that there never was any
  responsible archaeological authority for anything more than investigation.
  Poor old Walters was an honest antiquary, who was engaged in opening the tomb
  to find out if there was any truth in the legend about embalmed bodies. The
  rest was all rumour, of the sort that often anticipates or exaggerates such
  finds. As a fact, he found the body had not been embalmed, but had fallen
  into dust long ago. Only while he was working there by the light of his
  lonely candle in that sunken chapel, the candlelight threw another shadow
  that was not his own.'</p>

  <p>'Ah!' cried Lady Diana with a catch in her breath; 'and I know what you
  mean now. You mean to tell us we have met the murderer, talked and joked with
  the murderer, let him tell us a romantic tale, and let him depart
  untouched.'</p>

  <p>'Leaving his clerical disguise on a rock,' assented Brown. 'It is all
  dreadfully simple. This man got ahead of the Professor in the race to the
  churchyard and chapel, possibly while the Professor was talking to that
  lugubrious journalist. He came on the old clergyman beside the empty coffin
  and killed him. Then he dressed himself in the black clothes from the corpse,
  wrapped it in an old cope which had been among the real finds of the
  exploration, and put it in the coffin, arranging the rosary and the wooden
  support as I have described. Then, having thus set the trap for his second
  enemy, he went up into the daylight and greeted us all with the most amiable
  politeness of a country clergyman.'</p>

  <p>'He ran a considerable risk,' objected Tarrant, 'of somebody knowing
  Walters by sight.'</p>

  <p>'I admit he was half-mad,' agreed Father Brown; 'and I think you will
  admit that the risk was worth taking, for he has got off, after all.'</p>

  <p>'I'll admit he was very lucky,' growled Tarrant. 'And who the devil was
  he?'</p>

  <p>'As you say, he was very lucky,' answered Father Brown, 'and not least in
  that respect. For that is the one thing we may never know.' He frowned at the
  table for a moment and then went on: 'This fellow has been hovering round and
  threatening for years, but the one thing he was careful of was to keep the
  secret of who he was; and he has kept it still. But if poor Smaill recovers,
  as I think he will, it is pretty safe to say that you will hear more of
  it.'</p>

  <p>'Why, what will Professor Smaill do, do you think?' asked Lady Diana.</p>

  <p>'I should think the first thing he would do,' said Tarrant, 'would be to
  put the detectives on like dogs after this murdering devil. I should like to
  have a go at him myself.'</p>

  <p>'Well,' said Father Brown, smiling suddenly after his long fit of frowning
  perplexity, 'I think I know the very first thing he ought to do.'</p>

  <p>'And what is that?' asked Lady Diana with graceful eagerness.</p>

  <p>'He ought to apologize to all of you,' said Father Brown.</p>

  <p>It was not upon this point, however, that Father Brown found himself
  talking to Professor Smaill as he sat by the bedside during the slow
  convalescence of that eminent archaeologist. Nor, indeed, was it chiefly
  Father Brown who did the talking; for though the Professor was limited to
  small doses of the stimulant of conversation, he concentrated most of it upon
  these interviews with his clerical friend. Father Brown had a talent for
  being silent in an encouraging way and Smaill was encouraged by it to talk
  about many strange things not always easy to talk about; such as the morbid
  phases of recovery and the monstrous dreams that often accompany delirium. It
  is often rather an unbalancing business to recover slowly from a bad knock on
  the head; and when the head is as interesting a head as that of Professor
  Smaill even its disturbances and distortions are apt to be original and
  curious. His dreams were like bold and big designs rather out of drawing, as
  they can be seen in the strong but stiff archaic arts that he had studied;
  they were full of strange saints with square and triangular haloes, of golden
  out-standing crowns and glories round dark and flattened faces, of eagles
  out of the east and the high headdresses of bearded men with their hair bound
  like women. Only, as he told his friend, there was one much simpler and less
  entangled type, that continually recurred to his imaginative memory. Again
  and again all these Byzantine patterns would fade away like the fading gold
  on which they were traced as upon fire; and nothing remained but the dark
  bare wall of rock on which the shining shape of the fish was traced as with a
  finger dipped in the phosphorescence of fishes. For that was the sign which
  he once looked up and saw, in the moment when he first heard round the corner
  of the dark passage the voice of his enemy.</p>

  <p>'And at last,' he said, 'I think I have seen a meaning in the picture and
  the voice; and one that I never understood before. Why should I worry because
  one madman among a million of sane men, leagued in a great society against
  him, chooses to brag of persecuting me or pursuing me to death? The man who
  drew in the dark catacomb the secret symbol of Christ was persecuted in a
  very different fashion. He was the solitary madman; the whole sane society
  was leagued together not to save but to slay him. I have sometimes fussed and
  fidgeted and wondered whether this or that man was my persecutor; whether it
  was Tarrant; whether it was Leonard Smyth; whether it was any one of them.
  Suppose it had been all of them? Suppose it had been all the men on the boat
  and the men on the train and the men in the village. Suppose, so far as I was
  concerned, they were all murderers. I thought I had a right to be alarmed
  because I was creeping through the bowels of the earth in the dark and there
  was a man who would destroy me. What would it have been like, if the
  destroyer had been up in the daylight and had owned all the earth and
  commanded all the armies and the crowds? How if he had been able to stop all
  the earths or smoke me out of my hole, or kill me the moment I put my nose
  out in the daylight? What was it like to deal with murder on that scale? The
  world has forgotten these things, as until a little while ago it had
  forgotten war.'</p>

  <p>'Yes,' said Father Brown, 'but the war came. The fish may be driven
  underground again, but it will come up into the daylight once more. As St
  Antony of Padua humorously remarked, 'It is only fishes who survive the
  Deluge.''</p>

     name="story6">VI.&mdash;THE DAGGER WITH WINGS</a></h2>

<h3>First published in <i>Nash's Magazine</i>, Feb 1924</h3>

  <p class="first">FATHER BROWN, at one period of his life, found it difficult
  to hang his hat on a hat-peg without repressing a slight shudder. The origin
  of this idiosyncrasy was indeed a mere detail in much more complicated
  events; but it was perhaps the only detail that remained to him in his busy
  life to remind him of the whole business. Its remote origin was to be found
  in the facts which led Dr Boyne, the medical officer attached to the police
  force, to send for the priest on a particular frosty morning in December.</p>

  <p>Dr Boyne was a big dark Irishman, one of those rather baffling Irishmen to
  be found all over the world, who will talk scientific scepticism,
  materialism, and cynicism at length and at large, but who never dream of
  referring anything touching the ritual of religion to anything except the
  traditional religion of their native land. It would be hard to say whether
  their creed is a very superficial varnish or a very fundamental substratum;
  but most probably it is both, with a mass of materialism in between. Anyhow,
  when he thought that matters of that sort might be involved, he asked Father
  Brown to call, though he made no pretence of preference for that aspect of
  them.</p>

  <p>'I'm not sure I want you, you know,' was his greeting. 'I'm not sure about
  anything yet. I'm hanged if I can make out whether it's a case for a doctor,
  or a policeman, or a priest.'</p>

  <p>'Well,' said Father Brown with a smile, 'as I suppose you're both a
  policeman and a doctor, I seem to be rather in a minority.'</p>

  <p>'I admit you're what politicians call an instructed minority,' replied the
  doctor. 'I mean, I know you've had to do a little in our line as well as your
  own. But it's precious hard to say whether this business is in your line or
  ours, or merely in the line of the Commissioners in Lunacy. We've just had a
  message from a man living near here, in that white house on the hill, asking
  for protection against a murderous persecution. We've gone into the facts as
  far as we could, and perhaps I'd better tell you the story as it is supposed
  to have happened, from the beginning.</p>

  <p>'It seems that a man named Aylmer, who was a wealthy landowner in the West
  Country, married rather late in life and had three sons, Philip, Stephen, and
  Arnold. But in his bachelor days, when he thought he would have no heir, he
  had adopted a boy whom he thought very brilliant and promising, who went by
  the name of John Strake. His origin seems to be vague; they say he was a
  foundling; some say he was a gipsy. I think the last notion is mixed up with
  the fact that Aylmer in his old age dabbled in all sorts of dingy occultism,
  including palmistry and astrology, and his three sons say that Strake
  encouraged him in it. But they said a great many other things besides that.
  They said Strake was an amazing scoundrel, and especially an amazing liar; a
  genius in inventing lies on the spur of the moment, and telling them so as to
  deceive a detective. But that might very well be a natural prejudice, in the
  light of what happened.</p>

  <p>Perhaps you can more or less imagine what happened. The old man left
  practically everything to the adopted son; and when he died the three real
  sons disputed the will. They said their father had been frightened into
  surrender and, not to put too fine a point on it, into gibbering idiocy. They
  said Strake had the strangest and most cunning ways of getting at him, in
  spite of the nurses and the family, and terrorizing him on his death-bed.
  Anyhow, they seemed to have proved something about the dead man's mental
  condition, for the courts set aside the will and the sons inherited. Strake
  is said to have broken out in the most dreadful fashion, and sworn he would
  kill all three of them, one after another, and that nothing could hide them
  from his vengeance. It is the third or last of the brothers, Arnold Aylmer,
  who is asking for police protection.'</p>

  <p>'Third and last,' said the priest, looking at him gravely.</p>

  <p>'Yes,' said Boyne. 'The other two are dead.' There was a silence before he
  continued. 'That is where the doubt comes in. There is no proof they were
  murdered, but they might possibly have been. The eldest, who took up his
  position as squire, was supposed to have committed suicide in his garden. The
  second, who went into trade as a manufacturer, was knocked onthe head by the
  machinery in his factory; he might very well have taken a false step and
  fallen. But if Strake did kill them, he is certainly very cunning in his way
  of getting to work and getting away. On the other hand, it's more than likely
  that the whole thing is a mania of conspiracy founded on a coincidence. Look
  here, what I want is this. I want somebody of sense, who isn't an official,
  to go up and have a talk with this Mr Arnold Aylmer and form an impression of
  him. You know what a man with a delusion is like, and how a man looks when he
  is telling the truth. I want you to be the advance guard, before we take the
  matter up.'</p>

  <p>'It seems rather odd,' said Father Brown, 'that you haven't had to take it
  up before. If there is anything in this business, it seems to have been going
  on for a good time. Is there any particular reason why he should send for you
  just now, any more than any other time?'</p>

  <p>'That had occurred to me, as you may imagine,' answered Dr Boyne. 'He does
  give a reason, but I confess it is one of the things that make me wonder
  whether the whole thing isn't only the whim of some half-witted crank. He
  declared that all his servants have suddenly gone on strike and left him, so
  that he is obliged to call on the police to look after his house. And on
  making inquiries, I certainly do find that there has been a general exodus of
  servants from that house on the hill; and of course the town is full of
  tales, very one-sided tales I dare say. Their account of it seems to be that
  their employer had become quite impossible in his fidgets and fears and
  exactions; that he wanted them to guard the house like sentries, or sit up
  like night nurses in a hospital; that they could never be left alone because
  he must never be left alone. So they all announced in a loud voice that he
  was a lunatic, and left. Of course that does not prove he is a lunatic; but
  it seems rather rum nowadays for a man to expect his valet or his
  parlour-maid to act as an armed guard.'</p>

  <p>'And so,' said the priest with a smile, 'he wants a policeman to act as
  his parlour-maid because his parlour-maid won't act as a policeman.'</p>

  <p>'I thought that rather thick, too,' agreed the doctor; 'but I can't take
  the responsibility of a flat refusal till I've tried a compromise. You are
  the compromise.'</p>

  <p>'Very well,' said Father Brown simply. 'I'll go and call on him now if you
  like.'</p>

  <p>The rolling country round the little town was sealed and bound with frost,
  and the sky was as clear and cold as steel, except in the north-east where
  clouds with lurid haloes were beginning to climb up the sky. It was against
  these darker and more sinister colours that the house on the hill gleamed
  with a row of pale pillars, forming a short colonnade of the classical sort.
  A winding road led up to it across the curve of the down, and plunged into a
  mass of dark bushes. Just before it reached the bushes the air seemed to grow
  colder and colder, as if he were approaching an ice-house or the North Pole.
  But he was a highly practical person, never entertaining such fancies except
  as fancies. And he merely cocked his eye at the great livid cloud crawling up
  over the house, and remarked cheerfully: 'It's going to snow.'</p>

  <p>Through a low ornamental iron gateway of the Italianate pattern he entered
  a garden having something of that desolation which only belongs to the
  disorder of orderly things. Deep-green growths were grey with the faint
  powder of the frost, large weeds had fringed the fading pattern of the
  flower-beds as if in a ragged frame; and the house stood as if waist-high in
  a stunted forest of shrubs and bushes. The vegetation consisted largely of
  evergreens or very hardy plants; and though it was thus thick and heavy, it
  was too northern to be called luxuriant. It might be described as an Arctic
  jungle. So it was in some sense with the house itself, which had a row of
  columns and a classical facade, which might have looked out on the
  Mediterranean; but which seemed now to be withering in the wind of the North
  Sea. Classical ornament here and there accentuated the contrast; caryatides
  and carved masks of comedy or tragedy looked down from corners of the
  building upon the grey confusion of the garden paths; but the faces seemed to
  be frost-bitten. The very volutes of the capitals might have curled up with
  the cold.</p>

  <p>Father Brown went up the grassy steps to a square porch flanked by big
  pillars and knocked at the door. About four minutes afterwards he knocked
  again. Then he stood still patiently waiting with his back to the door and
  looked out on the slowly darkening landscape. It was darkening under the
  shadow of that one great continent of cloud that had come flying out of the
  north; and even as he looked out beyond the pillars of the porch, which
  seemed huge and black above him in the twilight, he saw the opalescent
  crawling rim of the great cloud as it sailed over the roof and bowed over the
  porch like a canopy. The great canopy with its faintly coloured fringes
  seemed to sink lower and lower upon the garden beyond, until what had
  recently been a clear and pale-hued winter sky was left in a few silver
  ribbons and rags like a sickly sunset. Father Brown waited, and there was no
  sound within.</p>

  <p>Then he betook himself briskly down the steps and round the house to look
  for another entrance. He eventually found one, a side door in the flat wall,
  and on this also he hammered and outside this also he waited. Then he tried
  the handle and found the door apparently bolted or fastened in some fashion;
  and then he moved along that side of the house, musing on the possibilities
  of the position, and wondering whether the eccentric Mr Aylmer had barricaded
  himself too deep in the house to hear any kind of summons; or whether perhaps
  he would barricade himself all the more, on the assumption that any summons
  must be the challenge of the avenging Strake. It might be that the decamping
  servants had only unlocked one door when they left in the morning, and that
  their master had locked that; but whatever he might have done it was unlikely
  that they, in the mood of that moment, had looked so carefully to the
  defences. He continued his prowl round the place: it was not really a large
  place, though perhaps a little pretentious; and in a few moments he found he
  had made the complete circuit. A moment after he found what he suspected and
  sought. The french window of one room, curtained and shadowed with creeper,
  stood open by a crack, doubtless accidentally left ajar, and he found himself
  in a central room, comfortably upholstered in a rather old-fashioned way,
  with a staircase leading up from it on one side and a door leading out of it
  on the other. Immediately opposite him was another door with red glass let
  into it, a little gaudily for later tastes; something that looked like a
  red-robed figure in cheap stained glass. On a round table to the right stood
  a sort of aquarium&mdash;a great bowl full of greenish water, in which fishes
  and similar things moved about as in a tank; and just opposite it a plant of
  the palm variety with very large green leaves. All this looked so very dusty
  and Early Victorian that the telephone, visible in the curtained alcove, was
  almost a surprise.</p>

  <p>'Who is that?' a voice called out sharply and rather suspiciously from
  behind the stained-glass door.</p>

  <p>'Could I see Mr Aylmer?' asked the priest apologetically.</p>

  <p>The door opened and a gentleman in a peacock-green dressing-gown came out
  with an inquiring look. His hair was rather rough and untidy, as if he had
  been in bed or lived in a state of slowly getting up, but his eyes were not
  only awake but alert, and some would have said alarmed. Father Brown knew
  that the contradiction was likely enough in a man who had rather run to seed
  under the shadow either of a delusion or a danger. He had a fine aquiline
  face when seen in profile, but when seen full face the first impression was
  that of the untidiness and even the wilderness of his loose brown beard.</p>

  <p>'I am Mr Aylmer,' he said, 'but I've got out of the way of expecting
  visitors.'</p>

  <p>Something about Mr Aylmer's unrestful eye prompted the priest to go
  straight to the point. If the man's persecution was only a monomania, he
  would be the less likely to resent it.</p>

  <p>'I was wondering,' said Father Brown softly, 'whether it is quite true
  that you never expect visitors.'</p>

  <p>'You are right,' replied his host steadily. 'I always expect one visitor.
  And he may be the last.'</p>

  <p>'I hope not,' said Father Brown, 'but at least I am relieved to infer that
  I do not look very like him.'</p>

  <p>Mr Aylmer shook himself with a sort of savage laugh. 'You certainly do
  not,' he said.</p>

  <p>'Mr Aylmer,' said Father Brown frankly, 'I apologize for the liberty, but
  some friends of mine have told me about your trouble, and asked me to see if
  I could do anything for you. The truth is, I have some little experience in
  affairs like this.'</p>

  <p>'There are no affairs like this,' said Aylmer.</p>

  <p>'You mean,' observed Father Brown, 'that the tragedies in your unfortunate
  family were not normal deaths?'</p>

  <p>'I mean they were not even normal murders,' answered the other. 'The man
  who is hounding us all to death is a hell-hound, and his power is from
  hell.'</p>

  <p>'All evil has one origin,' said the priest gravely. 'But how do you know
  they were not normal murders?'</p>

  <p>Aylmer answered with a gesture which offered his guest a chair; then he
  seated himself slowly in another, frowning, with his hands on his knees; but
  when he looked up his expression had grown milder and more thoughtful, and
  his voice was quite cordial and composed.</p>

  <p>'Sir,' he said, 'I don't want you to imagine that I'm in the least an
  unreasonable person. I have come to these conclusions by reason, because
  unfortunately reason really leads there. I have read a great deal on these
  subjects; for I was the only one who inherited my father's scholarship in
  somewhat obscure matters, and I have since inherited his library. But what I
  tell you does not rest on what I have read but on what I have seen.'</p>

  <p>Father Brown nodded, and the other proceeded, as if picking his words: 'In
  my elder brother's case I was not certain at first. There were no marks or
  footprints where he was found shot, and the pistol was left beside him. But
  he had just received a threatening letter certainly from our enemy, for it
  was marked with a sign like a winged dagger, which was one of his infernal
  cabalistic tricks. And a servant said she had seen something moving along the
  garden wall in the twilight that was much too large to be a cat. I leave it
  there; all I can say is that if the murderer came, he managed to leave no
  traces of his coming. But when my brother Stephen died it was different; and
  since then I have known. A machine was working in an open scaffolding under
  the factory tower; I scaled the platform a moment after he had fallen under
  the iron hammer that struck him; I did not see anything else strike him, but
  I saw what I saw.</p>

  <p>'A great drift of factory smoke was rolling between me and the factory
  tower; but through a rift of it I saw on the top of it a dark human figure
  wrapped in what looked like a black cloak. Then the sulphurous smoke drove
  between us again; and when it cleared I looked up at the distant
  chimney&mdash;there was nobody there. I am a rational man, and I will ask all
  rational men how he had reached that dizzy unapproachable turret, and how he
  left it.'</p>

  <p>He stared across at the priest with a sphinx-like challenge; then after a
  silence he said abruptly: 'My brother's brains were knocked out, but his body
  was not much damaged. And in his pocket we found one of those warning
  messages dated the day before and stamped with the flying dagger.</p>

  <p>'I am sure,' he went on gravely, 'that the symbol of the winged dagger is
  not merely arbitrary or accidental. Nothing about that abominable man is
  accidental. He is all design; though it is indeed a most dark and intricate
  design. His mind is woven not only out of elaborate schemes but out of all
  sorts of secret languages and signs, and dumb signals and wordless pictures
  which are the names of nameless things. He is the worst sort of man that the
  world knows: he is the wicked mystic. Now, I don't pretend to penetrate all
  that is conveyed by this symbol; but it seems surely that it must have a
  relation to all that was most remarkable, or even incredible, in his
  movements as he had hovered round my unfortunate family. Is there no
  connexion between the idea of a winged weapon and the mystery by which Philip
  was struck dead on his own lawn without the lightest touch of any footprint
  having disturbed the dust or grass? Is there no connexion between the plumed
  poignard flying like a feathered arrow and that figure which hung on the far
  top of the toppling chimney, clad in a cloak for pinions?'</p>

  <p>'You mean,' said Father Brown thoughtfully, 'that he is in a perpetual
  state of levitation.'</p>

  <p>'Simon Magus did it,' replied Aylmer, 'and it was one of the commonest
  predictions of the Dark Ages that Antichrist would be able to fly. Anyhow,
  there was the flying dagger on the document; and whether or no it could fly,
  it could certainly strike.'</p>

  <p>'Did you notice what sort of paper it was on?' asked Father Brown. 'Common
  paper?'</p>

  <p>The sphinx-like face broke abruptly into a harsh laugh.</p>

  <p>'You can see what they're like,' said Aylmer grimly, 'for I got one myself
  this morning.'</p>

  <p>He was leaning back in his chair now, with his long legs thrust out from
  under the green dressing-gown, which was a little short for him, and his
  bearded chin pillowed on his chest. Without moving otherwise, he thrust his
  hand deep in the dressing-gown pocket and held out a fluttering scrap of
  paper at the end of a rigid arm. His whole attitude was suggestive of a sort
  of paralysis, that was both rigidity and collapse. But the next remark of the
  priest had a curious effect of rousing him.</p>

  <p>Father Brown was blinking in his short-sighted way at the paper presented
  to him. It was a singular sort of paper, rough without being common, as from
  an artist's sketch-book; and on it was drawn boldly in red ink a dagger
  decorated with wings like the rod of Hermes, with the written words, 'Death
  comes the day after this, as it came to your brothers.'</p>

  <p>Father Brown tossed the paper on the floor and sat bolt upright in his
  chair.</p>

  <p>'You mustn't let that sort of stuff stupefy you,' he said sharply. 'These
  devils always try to make us helpless by making us hopeless.'</p>

  <p>Rather to his surprise, an awakening wave went over the prostrate figure,
  which sprang from its chair as if startled out of a dream.</p>

  <p>'You're right, you're right!' cried Aylmer with a rather uncanny
  animation; 'and the devils shall find that I'm not so hopeless after all, nor
  so helpless either. Perhaps I have more hope and better help than you
  fancy.'</p>

  <p>He stood with his hands in his pockets, frowning down at the priest, who
  had a momentary doubt, during that strained silence, about whether the man's
  long peril had not touched his brain. But when he spoke it was quite
  soberly.</p>

  <p>'I believe my unfortunate brothers failed because they used the wrong
  weapons. Philip carried a revolver, and that was how his death came to be
  called suicide. Stephen had police protection, but he also had a sense of
  what made him ridiculous; and he could not allow a policeman to climb up a
  ladder after him to a scaffolding where he stood only a moment. They were
  both scoffers, reacting into scepticism from the strange mysticism of my
  father's last days. But I always knew there was more in my father than they
  understood. It is true that by studying magic he fell at last under the
  blight of black magic; the black magic of this scoundrel Strake. But my
  brothers were wrong about the antidote. The antidote to black magic is not
  brute materialism or worldly wisdom. The antidote to black magic is white
  magic.'</p>

  <p>'It rather depends,' said Father Brown, 'what you mean by white
  magic.'</p>

  <p>'I mean silver magic,' said the other, in a low voice, like one speaking
  of a secret revelation. Then after a silence he said: 'Do you know what I
  mean by silver magic? Excuse me a moment.'</p>

  <p>He turned and opened the central door with the red glass and went into a
  passage beyond it. The house had less depth than Brown had supposed; instead
  of the door opening into interior rooms, the corridor it revealed ended in
  another door on the garden. The door of one room was on one side of the
  passage; doubtless, the priest told himself, the proprietor's bedroom whence
  he had rushed out in his dressing-gown. There was nothing else on that side
  but an ordinary hat-stand with the ordinary dingy cluster of old hats and
  overcoats; but on the other side was something more interesting: a very dark
  old oak sideboard laid out with some old silver, and overhung by a trophy or
  ornament of old weapons. It was by that that Arnold Aylmer halted, looking up
  at a long antiquated pistol with a bell-shaped mouth.</p>

  <p>The door at the end of the passage was barely open, and through the crack
  came a streak of white daylight. The priest had very quick instincts about
  natural things, and something in the unusual brilliancy of that white line
  told him what had happened outside. It was indeed what he had prophesied when
  he was approaching the house. He ran past his rather startled host and opened
  the door, to face something that was at once a blank and a blaze. What he had
  seen shining through the crack was not only the most negative whiteness of
  daylight but the positive whiteness of snow. All round, the sweeping fall of
  the country was covered with that shining pallor that seems at once hoary and
  innocent.</p>

  <p>'Here is white magic anyhow,' said Father Brown in his cheerful voice.
  Then, as he turned back into the hall, he murmured, 'And silver magic too, I
  suppose,' for the white lustre touched the silver with splendour and lit up
  the old steel here and there in the darkling armoury. The shaggy head of the
  brooding Aylmer seemed to have a halo of silver fire, as he turned with his
  face in shadow and the outlandish pistol in his hand.</p>

  <p>'Do you know why I chose this sort of old blunderbuss?' he asked. 'Because
  I can load it with this sort of bullet.'</p>

  <p>He had picked up a small apostle spoon from the sideboard and by sheer
  violence broke off the small figure at the top. 'Let us go back into the
  other room,' he added.</p>

  <p>'Did you ever read about the death of Dundee?' he asked when they had
  reseated themselves. He had recovered from his momentary annoyance at the
  priest's restlessness. 'Graham of Claverhouse, you know, who persecuted the
  Covenanters and had a black horse that could ride straight up a precipice.
  Don't you know he could only be shot with a silver bullet, because he had
  sold himself to the Devil? That's one comfort about you; at least you know
  enough to believe in the Devil.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, yes,' replied Father Brown, 'I believe in the Devil. What I don't
  believe in is the Dundee. I mean the Dundee of Covenanting legends, with his
  nightmare of a horse. John Graham was simply a seventeenth-century
  professional soldier, rather better than most. If he dragooned them it was
  because he was a dragoon, but not a dragon. Now my experience is that it's
  not that sort of swaggering blade who sells himself to the Devil. The
  devil-worshippers I've known were quite different. Not to mention names,
  which might cause a social flutter, I'll take a man in Dundee's own day. Have
  you ever heard of Dalrymple of Stair?'</p>

  <p>'No,' replied the other gruffly.</p>

  <p>'You've heard of what he did,' said Father Brown, 'and it was worse than
  anything Dundee ever did; yet he escapes the infamy by oblivion. He was the
  man who made the Massacre of Glencoe. He was a very learned man and lucid
  lawyer, a statesman with very serious and enlarged ideas of statesmanship, a
  quiet man with a very refined and intellectual face. That's the sort of man
  who sells himself to the Devil.'</p>

  <p>Aylmer half started from his chair with an enthusiasm of eager assent.</p>

  <p>'By God! you are right,' he cried. 'A refined intellectual face! That is
  the face of John Strake.'</p>

  <p>Then he raised himself and stood looking at the priest with a curious
  concentration. 'If you will wait here a little while,' he said, 'I will show
  you something.'</p>

  <p>He went back through the central door, closing it after him; going, the
  priest presumed, to the old sideboard or possibly to his bedroom. Father
  Brown remained seated, gazing abstractedly at the carpet, where a faint red
  glimmer shone from the glass in the doorway. Once it seemed to brighten like
  a ruby and then darkened again, as if the sun of that stormy day had passed
  from cloud to cloud. Nothing moved except the aquatic creatures which floated
  to and fro in the dim green bowl. Father Brown was thinking hard.</p>

  <p>A minute or two afterwards he got up and slipped quietly to the alcove of
  the telephone, where he rang up his friend Dr Boyne, at the official
  headquarters. 'I wanted to tell you about Aylmer and his affairs,' he said
  quietly. 'It's a queer story, but I rather think there's something in it. If
  I were you I'd send some men up here straight away; four or five men, I
  think, and surround the house. If anything does happen there'll probably be
  something startling in the way of an escape.'</p>

  <p>Then he went back and sat down again, staring at the dark carpet, which
  again glowed blood-red with the light from the glass door. Something in the
  filtered light set his mind drifting on certain borderlands of thought, with
  the first white daybreak before the coming of colour, and all that mystery
  which is alternately veiled and revealed in the symbol of windows and of
  doors.</p>

  <p>An inhuman howl in a human voice came from beyond the closed doors, almost
  simultaneously with the noise of firing. Before the echoes of the shot had
  died away the door was violently flung open and his host staggered into the
  room, the dressing-gown half torn from his shoulder and the long pistol
  smoking in his hand. He seemed to be shaking in every limb, yet he was shaken
  in part with an unnatural laughter.</p>

  <p>'Glory be to the White Magic!' he cried. 'Glory be to the silver bullet!
  The hell-hound had hunted once too often, and my brothers are avenged at
  last.'</p>

  <p>He sank into a chair and the pistol slid from his hand and fell on the
  floor. Father Brown darted past him, slipped through the glass door and went
  down the passage. As he did so he put his hand on the handle of the bedroom
  door, as if half intending to enter; then he stooped a moment, as if
  examining something&mdash;and then he ran to the outer door and opened
  it.</p>

  <p>On the field of snow, which had been so blank a little while before, lay
  one black object. At the first glance it looked a little like an enormous
  bat. A second glance showed that it was, after all, a human figure; fallen on
  its face, the whole head covered by a broad black hat having something of a
  Latin-American look; while the appearance of black wings came from the two
  flaps or loose sleeves of a very vast black cloak spread out, perhaps by
  accident, to their utmost length on either side. Both the hands were hidden,
  though Father Brown thought he could detect the position of one of them, and
  saw close to it, under the edge of the cloak, the glimmer of some metallic
  weapon. The main effect, however, was curiously like that of the simple
  extravagances of heraldry; like a black eagle displayed on a white ground.
  But by walking round it and peering under the hat the priest got a glimpse of
  the face, which was indeed what his host had called refined and intellectual;
  even sceptical and austere: the face of John Strake.</p>

  <p>'Well, I'm jiggered,' muttered Father Brown. 'It really does look like
  some vast vampire that has swooped down like a bird.'</p>

  <p>'How else could he have come?' came a voice from the doorway, and Father
  Brown looked up to see Aylmer once more standing there.</p>

  <p>'Couldn't he have walked?' replied Father Brown evasively.</p>

  <p>Aylmer stretched out his arm and swept the white landscape with a
  gesture.</p>

  <p>'Look at the snow,' he said in a deep voice that had a sort of roll and
  thrill in it. 'Is not the snow unspotted&mdash;pure as the white magic you
  yourself called it? Is there a speck on it for miles, save that one foul
  black blot that has fallen there? There are no footprints, but a few of yours
  and mine; there are none approaching the house from anywhere.'</p>

  <p>Then he looked at the little priest for a moment with a concentrated and
  curious expression, and said: 'I will tell you something else. That cloak he
  flies with is too long to walk with. He was not a very tall man, and it would
  trail behind him like a royal train. Stretch it out over his body, if you
  like, and see.'</p>

  <p>'What happened to you both?' asked Father Brown abruptly.</p>

  <p>'It was too swift to describe,' answered Aylmer. 'I had looked out of the
  door and was turning back when there came a kind of rushing of wind all
  around me, as if I were being buffeted by a wheel revolving in mid-air. I
  spun round somehow and fired blindly; and then I saw nothing but what you see
  now. But I am morally certain that you wouldn't see it if I had not had a
  silver shot in my gun. It would have been a different body lying there in the
  snow.'</p>

  <p>'By the way,' remarked Father Brown, 'shall we leave it lying there in the
  snow? Or would you like it taken into your room&mdash;I suppose that's your
  bedroom in the passage?'</p>

  <p>'No, no,' replied Aylmer hastily, 'we must leave it here till the police
  have seen it. Besides, I've had as much of such things as I can stand for the
  moment. Whatever else happens, I'm going to have a drink. After that, they
  can hang me if they like.'</p>

  <p>Inside the central apartment, between the palm plant and the bowl of
  fishes, Aylmer tumbled into a chair. He had nearly knocked the bowl over as
  he lurched into the room, but he had managed to find the decanter of brandy
  after plunging his hand rather blindly into several cupboards and corners. He
  did not at any time look like a methodical person, but at this moment his
  distraction must have been extreme. He drank with a long gulp and began to
  talk rather feverishly, as if to fill up a silence.</p>

  <p>'I see you are still doubtful,' he said, 'though you have seen the thing
  with your own eyes. Believe me, there was something more behind the quarrel
  between the spirit of Strake and the spirit of the house of Aylmer. Besides,
  you have no business to be an unbeliever. You ought to stand for all the
  things these stupid people call superstitions. Come now, don't you think
  there's a lot in those old wives' tales about luck and charms and so on,
  silver bullets included? What do you say about them as a Catholic?'</p>

  <p>'I say I'm an agnostic,' replied Father Brown, smiling.</p>

  <p>'Nonsense,' said Aylmer impatiently. 'It's your business to believe
  things.'</p>

  <p>'Well, I do believe some things, of course,' conceded Father Brown; 'and
  therefore, of course, I don't believe other things.'</p>

  <p>Aylmer was leaning forward, and looking at him with a strange intensity
  that was almost like that of a mesmerist.</p>

  <p>'You do believe it,' he said. 'You do believe everything. We all believe
  everything, even when we deny everything. The denyers believe. The
  unbelievers believe. Don't you feel in your heart that these contradictions
  do not really contradict: that there is a cosmos that contains them all? The
  soul goes round upon a wheel of stars and all things return; perhaps Strake
  and I have striven in many shapes, beast against beast and bird against bird,
  and perhaps we shall strive for ever. But since we seek and need each other,
  even that eternal hatred is an eternal love. Good and evil go round in a
  wheel that is one thing and not many. Do you not realize in your heart, do
  you not believe behind all your beliefs, that there is but one reality and we
  are its shadows; and that all things are but aspects of one thing: a centre
  where men melt into Man and Man into God?'</p>

  <p>'No,' said Father Brown.</p>

  <p>Outside, twilight had begun to fall, in that phase of such a snow-laden
  evening when the land looks brighter than the sky. In the porch of the main
  entrance, visible through a half-curtained window. Father Brown could dimly
  see a bulky figure standing. He glanced casually at the french windows
  through which he had originally entered, and saw they were darkened with two
  equally motionless figures. The inner door with the coloured glass stood
  slightly ajar; and he could see in the short corridor beyond, the ends of two
  long shadows, exaggerated and distorted by the level light of evening, but
  still like grey caricatures of the figures of men. Dr Boyne had already
  obeyed the telephone message. The house was surrounded.</p>

  <p>'What is the good of saying no?' insisted his host, still with the same
  hypnotic stare. 'You have seen part of that eternal drama with your own eyes.
  You have seen the threat of John Strake to slay Arnold Aylmer by black magic.
  You have seen Arnold Aylmer slay John Strake by white magic. You see Arnold
  Aylmer alive and talking to you now. And yet you don't believe it.'</p>

  <p>'No, I do not believe it,' said Father Brown, and rose from his chair like
  one terminating a visit.</p>

  <p>'Why not?' asked the other.</p>

  <p>The priest only lifted his voice a little, but it sounded in every corner
  of the room like a bell. 'Because you are not Arnold Aylmer,' he said. 'I
  know who you are. Your name is John Strake; and you have murdered the last of
  the brothers, who is lying outside in the snow.'</p>

  <p>A ring of white showed round the iris of the other man's eyes; he seemed
  to be making, with bursting eyeballs, a last effort to mesmerize and master
  his companion. Then he made a sudden movement sideways; and even as he did so
  the door behind him opened and a big detective in plain clothes put one hand
  quietly on his shoulder. The other hand hung down, but it held a revolver.
  The man looked wildly round, and saw plain-clothes men in all corners of
  the quiet room.</p>

  <p>That evening Father Brown had another and longer conversation with Dr
  Boyne about the tragedy of the Aylmer family. By that time there was no
  longer any doubt of the central fact of the case, for John Strake had
  confessed his identity and even confessed his crimes; only it would be truer
  to say that he boasted of his victories. Compared to the fact that he had
  rounded off his life's work with the last Aylmer lying dead, everything else,
  including existence itself, seemed to be indifferent to him.</p>

  <p>'The man is a sort of monomaniac,' said Father Brown. 'He is not
  interested in any other matter; not even in any other murder. I owe him
  something for that; for I had to comfort myself with the reflection a good
  many times this afternoon. As has doubtless occurred to you, instead of
  weaving all that wild but ingenious romance about winged vampires and silver
  bullets, he might have put an ordinary leaden bullet into me, and walked out
  of the house. I assure you it occurred quite frequently to me.'</p>

  <p>'I wonder why he didn't,' observed Boyne. 'I don't understand it; but I
  don't understand anything yet. How on earth did you discover it, and what in
  the world did you discover?'</p>

  <p>'Oh, you provided me with very valuable information,' replied Father Brown
  modestly, 'especially the one piece of information that really counted. I
  mean the statement that Strake was a very inventive and imaginative liar,
  with great presence of mind in producing his lies. This afternoon he needed
  it; but he rose to the occasion. Perhaps his only mistake was in choosing a
  preternatural story; he had the notion that because I am a clergyman I should
  believe anything. Many people have little notions of that kind.'</p>

  <p>'But I can't make head or tail of it,' said the doctor. 'You must really
  begin at the beginning.'</p>

  <p>'The beginning of it was a dressing-gown,' said Father Brown simply. 'It
  was the one really good disguise I've ever known. When you meet a man in a
  house with a dressing-gown on, you assume quite automatically that he's in
  his own house. I assumed it myself; but afterwards queer little things began
  to happen. When he took the pistol down he clicked it at arm's length, as a
  man does to make sure a strange weapon isn't loaded; of course he would know
  whether the pistols in his own hall were loaded or not. I didn't like the way
  he looked for the brandy, or the way he nearly barged into the bowl of
  fishes. For a man who has a fragile thing of that sort as a fixture in his
  rooms gets a quite mechanical habit of avoiding it. But these things might
  possibly have been fancies; the first real point was this. He came out from
  the little passage between the two doors; and in that passage there's only
  one other door leading to a room; so I assumed it was the bedroom he had just
  come from. I tried the handle; but it was locked. I thought this odd; and
  looked through the keyhole. It was an utterly bare room, obviously deserted;
  no bed, no anything. Therefore he had not come from inside any room, but from
  outside the house. And when I saw that, I think I saw the whole picture.</p>

  <p>'Poor Arnold Aylmer doubtless slept and perhaps lived upstairs, and came
  down in his dressing-gown and passed through the red glass door. At the end
  of the passage, black against the winter daylight, he saw the enemy of his
  house. He saw a tall bearded man in a broad-brimmed black hat and a large
  flapping black cloak. He did not see much more in this world. Strake sprang
  at him, throttling or stabbing him; we cannot be sure till the inquest. Then
  Strake, standing in the narrow passage between the hat-stand and the old
  sideboard, and looking down in triumph on the last of his foes heard
  something he had not expected. He heard footsteps in the parlour beyond. It
  was myself entering by the french windows.</p>

  <p>'His masquerade was a miracle of promptitude. It involved not only a
  disguise but a romance&mdash;an impromptu romance. He took off his big black
  hat and cloak and put on the dead man's dressing-gown. Then he did a rather
  grisly thing; at least a thing that affects my fancy as more grisly than the
  rest. He hung the corpse like a coat on one of the hat pegs. He draped it in
  his own long cloak, and found it hung well below the heels; he covered the
  head entirely with his own wide hat. It was the only possible way of hiding
  it in that little passage with the locked door; but it was really a very
  clever one. I myself walked past the hat-stand once without knowing it was
  anything but a hat-stand. I think that unconsciousness of mine will always
  give me a shiver.</p>

  <p>'He might perhaps have left it at that; but I might have discovered the
  corpse at any minute; and, hung where it was, it was a corpse calling for
  what you might call an explanation. He adopted the bolder stroke of
  discovering it himself and explaining it himself.</p>

  <p>'Then there dawned on this strange and frightfully fertile mind the
  conception of a story of substitution; the reversal of the parts. He had
  already assumed the part of Arnold Aylmer. Why should not his dead enemy
  assume the part of John Strake? There must have been something in that
  topsy-turyydom to take the fancy of that darkly fanciful man. It was like
  some frightful fancy-dress ball to which the two mortal enemies were to go
  dressed up as each other. Only, the fancy-dress ball was to be a dance of
  death: and one of the dancers would be dead. That is why I can imagine that
  man putting it in his own mind, and I can imagine him smiling.'</p>

  <p>Father Brown was gazing into vacancy with his large grey eyes, which, when
  not blurred by his trick of blinking, were the one notable thing in his face.
  He went on speaking simply and seriously: 'All things are from God; and above
  all, reason and imagination and the great gifts of the mind. They are good in
  themselves; and we must not altogether forget their origin even in their
  perversion. Now this man had in him a very noble power to be perverted; the
  power of telling stories. He was a great novelist; only he had twisted his
  fictive power to practical and to evil ends; to deceiving men with false fact
  instead of with true fiction. It began with his deceiving old Aylmer with
  elaborate excuses and ingeniously detailed lies; but even that may have been,
  at the beginning, little more than the tall stories and tarradiddles of the
  child who may say equally he has seen the King of England or the King of the
  Fairies. It grew strong in him through the vice that perpetuates all vices,
  pride; he grew more and more vain of his promptitude in producing stories of
  his originality, and subtlety in developing them. That is what the young
  Aylmers meant by saying that he could always cast a spell over their father;
  and it was true. It was the sort of spell that the storyteller cast over the
  tyrant in the Arabian Nights. And to the last he walked the world with the
  pride of a poet, and with the false yet unfathomable courage of a great liar.
  He could always produce more Arabian Nights if ever his neck was in danger.
  And today his neck was in danger.</p>

  <p>'But I am sure, as I say, that he enjoyed it as a fantasy as well as a
  conspiracy. He set about the task of telling the true story the wrong way
  round: of treating the dead man as living and the live man as dead. He had
  already got into Aylmer's dressing-gown; he proceeded to get into Aylmer's
  body and soul. He looked at the corpse as if it were his own corpse lying
  cold in the snow. Then he spread-eagled it in that strange fashion to suggest
  the sweeping descent of a bird of prey, and decked it out not only in his own
  dark and flying garments but in a whole dark fairy-tale about the black bird
  that could only fall by the silver bullet. I do not know whether it was the
  silver glittering on the sideboard or the snow shining beyond the door that
  suggested to his intensely artistic temperament the theme of white magic and
  the white metal used against magicians. But whatever its origin, he made it
  his own like a poet; and did it very promptly, like a practical man. He
  completed the exchange and reversal of parts by flinging the corpse out on to
  the snow as the corpse of Strake. He did his best to work up a creepy
  conception of Strake as something hovering in the air everywhere, a harpy
  with wings of speed and claws of death; to explain the absence of footprints
  and other things. For one piece of artistic impudence I hugely admire him. He
  actually turned one of the contradictions in his case into an argument for
  it; and said that the man's cloak being too long for him proved that he never
  walked on the ground like an ordinary mortal. But he looked at me very hard
  while he said that; and something told me that he was at that moment trying a
  very big bluff.'</p>

  <p>Dr Boyne looked thoughtful. 'Had you discovered the truth by then?' he
  asked. 'There is something very queer and close to the nerves, I think, about
  notions affecting identity. I don't know whether it would be more weird to
  get a guess like that swiftly or slowly. I wonder when you suspected and when
  you were sure.'</p>

  <p>'I think I really suspected when I telephoned to you,' replied his friend.
  'And it was nothing more than the red light from the closed door brightening
  and darkening on the carpet. It looked like a splash of blood that grew vivid
  as it cried for vengeance. Why should it change like that? I knew the sun had
  not come out; it could only be because the second door behind it had been
  opened and shut on the garden. But if he had gone out and seen his enemy
  then, he would have raised the alarm then; and it was some time afterwards
  that the fracas occurred. I began to feel he had gone out to do something ...
  to prepare something ... but as to when I was certain, that is a different
  matter. I knew that right at the end he was trying to hypnotize me, to master
  me by the black art of eyes like talismans and a voice like an incantation.
  That's what he used to do with old Aylmer, no doubt. But it wasn't only the
  way he said it, it was what he said. It was the religion and philosophy of
  it.'</p>

  <p>'I'm afraid I'm a practical man,' said the doctor with gruff humour, 'and
  I don't bother much about religion and philosophy.'</p>

  <p>'You'll never be a practical man till you do,' said Father Brown. 'Look
  here, doctor; you know me pretty well; I think you know I'm not a bigot. You
  know I know there are all sorts in all religions; good men in bad ones and
  bad men in good ones. But there's just one little fact I've learned simply as
  a practical man, an entirely practical point, that I've picked up by
  experience, like the tricks of an animal or the trade-mark of a good wine.
  I've scarcely ever met a criminal who philosophized at all, who didn't
  philosophize along those lines of orientalism and recurrence and
  reincarnation, and the wheel of destiny and the serpent biting its own tail.
  I have found merely in practice that there is a curse on the servants of that
  serpent; on their belly shall they go and the dust shall they eat; and there
  was never a blackguard or a profligate born who could not talk that sort of
  spirituality. It may not be like that in its real religious origins; but here
  in our working world it is the religion of rascals; and I knew it was a
  rascal who was speaking.'</p>

  <p>'Why,' said Boyne, 'I should have thought that a rascal could pretty well
  profess any religion he chose.'</p>

  <p>'Yes,' assented the other; 'he could profess any religion; that is he
  could pretend to any religion, if it was all a pretence. If it was mere
  mechanical hypocrisy and nothing else, no doubt it could be done by a mere
  mechanical hypocrite. Any sort of mask can be put on any sort of face.
  Anybody can learn certain phrases or state verbally that he holds certain
  views. I can go out into the street and state that I am a Wesleyan Methodist
  or a Sandemanian, though I fear in no very convincing accent. But we are
  talking about an artist; and for the enjoyment of the artist the mask must be
  to some extent moulded on the face. What he makes outside him must correspond
  to something inside him; he can only make his effects out of some of the
  materials of his soul. I suppose he could have said he was a Wesleyan
  Methodist; but he could never be an eloquent Methodist as he can be an
  eloquent mystic and fatalist. I am talking of the sort of ideal such a man
  thinks of if he really tries to be idealistic. It was his whole game with me
  to be as idealistic as possible; and whenever that is attempted by that sort
  of man, you will generally find it is that sort of ideal. That sort of man
  may be dripping with gore; but he will always be able to tell you quite
  sincerely that Buddhism is better than Christianity. Nay, he will tell you
  quite sincerely that Buddhism is more Christian than Christianity. That alone
  is enough to throw a hideous and ghastly ray of light on his notion of
  Christianity.'</p>

  <p>'Upon my soul,' said the doctor, laughing, 'I can't make out whether
  you're denouncing or defending him.'</p>

  <p>'It isn't defending a man to say he is a genius,' said Father Brown. 'Far
  from it. And it is simply a psychological fact that an artist will betray
  himself by some sort of sincerity. Leonardo da Vinci cannot draw as if he
  couldn't draw. Even if he tried, it will always be a strong parody of a weak
  thing. This man would have made something much too fearful and wonderful out
  of the Wesleyan Methodist.'</p>

  <p>When the priest went forth again and set his face homeward, the cold had
  grown more intense and yet was somehow intoxicating. The trees stood up like
  silver candelabra of some incredible cold candlemas of purification. It was a
  piercing cold, like that silver sword of pure pain that once pierced the very
  he of purity. But it was not a killing cold, save in the sense of seeming to
  kill all the mortal obstructions to our immortal and immeasurable vitality.
  The pale green sky of twilight, with one star like the star of Bethlehem,
  seemed by some strange contradiction to be a cavern of clarity. It was as if
  there could be a green furnace of cold which wakened all things to life like
  warmth, and that the deeper they went into those cold crystalline colours the
  more were they light like winged creatures and clear like coloured glass! It
  tingled with truth and it divided truth from error with a blade like ice; but
  all that was left had never felt so much alive. It was as if all joy were a
  jewel in the heart of an iceberg. The priest hardly understood his own mood
  as he advanced deeper and, deeper into the green gloaming, drinking deeper
  and deeper draughts of that virginal vivacity of the air. Some forgotten
  muddle and morbidity seemed to be left behind, or wiped out as the snow had
  painted out the footprints of the man of blood. As he shuffled homewards
  through the snow, he muttered to himself: 'And yet he is right enough about
  there being a white magic, if he only knows where to look for it.'</p>

  <h2><a id="story7"
     name="story7">VII.&mdash;THE DOOM OF THE DARNAWAYS</a></h2>

<h3>(No record of prior magazine publication found)</h3>

  <p class="first">Two landscape-painters stood looking at one landscape, which
  was also a seascape, and both were curiously impressed by it, though their
  impressions were not exactly the same. To one of them, who was a rising
  artist from London, it was new as well as strange. To the other, who was a
  local artist but with something more than a local celebrity, it was better
  known; but perhaps all the more strange for what he knew of it.</p>

  <p>In terms of tone and form, as these men saw it, it was a stretch of sands
  against a stretch of sunset, the whole scene lying in strips of sombre
  colour, dead green and bronze and brown and a drab that was not merely dull
  but in that gloaming in some way more mysterious than gold. All that broke
  these level lines was a long building which ran out from the fields into the
  sands of the sea, so that its fringe of dreary weeds and rushes seemed almost
  to meet the seaweed. But its most singular feature was that the upper part of
  it had the ragged outlines of a ruin, pierced by so many wide windows and
  large rents as to be a mere dark skeleton against the dying light; while the
  lower bulk of the building had hardly any windows at all, most of them being
  blind and bricked up and their outlines only faintly traceable in the
  twilight. But one window at least was still a window; and it seemed strangest
  of all that it showed a light.</p>

  <p>'Who on earth can live in that old shell?' exclaimed the Londoner, who was
  a big, bohemian-looking man, young but with a shaggy red beard that made him
  look older; Chelsea knew him familiarly as Harry Payne.</p>

  <p>'Ghosts, you might suppose,' replied his friend Martin Wood. 'Well, the
  people who live there really are rather like ghosts.'</p>

  <p>It was perhaps rather a paradox that the London artist seemed almost
  bucolic in his boisterous freshness and wonder, while the local artist seemed
  a more shrewd and experienced person, regarding him with mature and amiable
  amusement; indeed, the latter was altogether a quieter and more conventional
  figure, wearing darker clothes and with his square and stolid face clean
  shaven.</p>

  <p>'It is only a sign of the times, of course,' he went on,' or of the
  passing of old times and old families with them. The last of the great
  Darnaways live in that house, and not many of the new poor are as poor as
  they are. They can't even afford to make their own top-storey habitable; but
  have to live in the lower rooms of a ruin, like bats and owls. Yet they have
  family portraits that go back to the Wars of the Roses and the first
  portrait-painting in England, and very fine some of them are; I happen to
  know, because they asked for my professional advice in overhauling them.
  There's one of them especially, and one of the earliest, but it's so good
  that it gives you the creeps.'</p>

  <p>'The whole place gives you the creeps, I should think by the look of it,'
  replied Payne.</p>

  <p>'Well,' said his friend, 'to tell you the truth, it does.'</p>

  <p>The silence that followed was stirred by a faint rustle among the rushes
  by the moat; and it gave them, rationally enough, a slight nervous start when
  a dark figure brushed along the bank, moving rapidly and almost like a
  startled bird. But it was only a man walking briskly with a black bag in his
  hand: a man with a long sallow face and sharp eyes that glanced at the London
  stranger in a slightly darkling and suspicious manner.</p>

  <p>'It's only Dr Barnet,' said Wood with a sort of relief. 'Good evening,
  Doctor. Are you going up to the house? I hope nobody's ill.'</p>

  <p>'Everybody's always ill in a place like that,' growled the doctor; 'only
  sometimes they're too ill to know it. The very air of the place is a blight
  and a pestilence. I don't envy the young man from Australia.'</p>

  <p>'And who,' asked Payne abruptly and rather absently, 'may the young man
  from Australia be?'</p>

  <p>'Ah!' snorted the doctor; 'hasn't your friend told you about him? As a
  matter of fact I believe he is arriving today. Quite a romance in the old
  style of melodrama: the heir back from the colonies to his ruined castle, all
  complete even down to an old family compact for his marrying the lady
  watching in the ivied tower. Queer old stuff, isn't it? but it really happens
  sometimes. He's even got a little money, which is the only bright spot there
  ever was in this business.'</p>

  <p>'What does Miss Darnaway herself, in her ivied tower, think of the
  business?' asked Martin Wood dryly.</p>

  <p>'What she thinks of everything else by this time,' replied the doctor.
  'They don't think in this weedy old den of superstitions, they only dream and
  drift. I think she accepts the family contract and the colonial husband as
  part of the Doom of the Darnaways, don't you know. I really think that if he
  turned out to be a humpbacked Negro with one eye and a homicidal mania, she
  would only think it added a finishing touch and fitted in with the twilight
  scenery.'</p>

  <p>'You're not giving my friend from London a very lively picture of my
  friends in the country,' said Wood, laughing. 'I had intended taking him
  there to call; no artist ought to miss those Darnaway portraits if he gets
  the chance. But perhaps I'd better postpone it if they're in the middle of
  the Australian invasion.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, do go in and see them, for the Lord's sake,' said Dr Barnet warmly.
  'Anything that will brighten their blighted lives will make my task easier.
  It will need a good many colonial cousins to cheer things up, I should think;
  and the more the merrier. Come, I'll take you in myself.'</p>

  <p>As they drew nearer to the house it was seen to be isolated like an island
  in a moat of brackish water which they crossed by a bridge. On the other side
  spread a fairly wide stony floor or embankment with great cracks across it,
  in which little tufts of weed and thorn sprouted here and there. This rock
  platform looked large and bare in the grey twilight, and Payne could hardly
  have believed that such a corner of space could have contained so much of the
  soul of a wilderness. This platform only jutted out on one side, like a giant
  door-step and beyond it was the door; a very low-browed Tudor archway
  standing open, but dark like a cave.</p>

  <p>When the brisk doctor led them inside without ceremony, Payne had, as it
  were, another shock of depression. He could have expected to find himself
  mounting to a very ruinous tower, by very narrow winding staircases; but in
  this case the first steps into the house were actually steps downwards. They
  went down several short and broken stairways into large twilit rooms which
  but for their lines of dark pictures and dusty bookshelves, might have been
  the traditional dungeons beneath the castle moat. Here and there a candle in
  an old candlestick lit up some dusty accidental detail of a dead elegance;
  but the visitor was not so much impressed or depressed by this artificial
  light as by the one pale gleam of natural light. As he passed down the long
  room he saw the only window in that wall&mdash;a curious low oval window of a
  late-seventeenth-century fashion. But the strange thing about it was that
  it did not look out directly on any space of sky but only on a reflection of
  sky; a pale strip of daylight merely mirrored in the moat, under the hanging
  shadow of the bank. Payne had a memory of the Lady of Shallot who never saw
  the world outside except in a mirror. The lady of this Shallot not only in
  some sense saw the world in a mirror, but even saw the world upside-down.</p>

  <p>'It's as if the house of Darnaway were falling literally as well as
  metaphorically,' said Wood in a low voice; 'as if it were sinking slowly into
  a swamp or a quicksand, until the sea goes over it like a green roof.'</p>

  <p>Even the sturdy Dr Barnet started a little at the silent approach of the
  figure that came to receive them. Indeed, the room was so silent that they
  were all startled to realize that it was not empty. There were three people
  in it when they entered: three dim figures motionless in the dim room; all
  three dressed in black and looking like dark shadows. As the foremost figure
  drew nearer the grey light from the window, he showed a face that looked
  almost as grey as its frame of hair. This was old Vine, the steward, long
  left in loco parentis since the death of that eccentric parent, the last Lord
  Darnaway. He would have been a handsome old man if he had had no teeth. As it
  was, he had one which showed every now and then and gave him a rather
  sinister appearance. He received the doctor and his friends with a fine
  courtesy and escorted them to where the other two figures in black were
  seated. One of them seemed to Payne to give another appropriate touch of
  gloomy antiquity to the castle by the mere fact of being a Roman Catholic
  priest, who might have come out of a priest's hole in the dark old days.
  Payne could imagine him muttering prayers or telling beads, or tolling bells
  or doing a number of indistinct and melancholy things in that melancholy
  place. Just then he might be supposed to have been giving religious
  consolation to the lady; but it could hardly be supposed that the consolation
  was very consoling, or at any rate that it was very cheering. For the rest,
  the priest was personally insignificant enough, with plain and rather
  expressionless features; but the lady was a very different matter. Her face
  was very far from being plain or insignificant; it stood out from the
  darkness of her dress and hair and background with a pallor that was almost
  awful, but a beauty that was almost awfully alive. Payne looked at it as long
  as he dared; and he was to look at it a good deal longer before he died.</p>

  <p>Wood merely exchanged with his friends such pleasant and polite phrases as
  would lead up to his purpose of revisiting the portraits. He apologized for
  calling on the day which he heard was to be one of family welcome; but he was
  soon convinced that the family was rather mildly relieved to have visitors to
  distract them or break the shock. He did not hesitate, therefore, to lead
  Payne through the central reception-room into the library beyond, where
  hung the portrait, for there was one which he was especially bent on showing,
  not only as a picture but almost as a puzzle. The little priest trudged along
  with them; he seemed to know something about old pictures as well as about
  old prayers.</p>

  <p>'I'm rather proud of having spotted this,' said Wood.' I believe it's a
  Holbein. If it isn't, there was somebody living in Holbein's time who was as
  great as Holbein.'</p>

  <p>It was a portrait in the hard but sincere and living fashion of the
  period, representing a man clad in black trimmed with gold and fur, with a
  heavy, full, rather pale face but watchful eyes.</p>

  <p>'What a pity art couldn't have stopped for ever at just that transition
  stage,' cried Wood, 'and never transitioned any more. Don't you see it's just
  realistic enough to be real? Don't you see the face speaks all the more
  because it stands out from a rather stiffer framework of less essential
  things? And the eyes are even more real than the face. On my soul, I think
  the eyes are too real for the face! It's just as if those sly, quick eyeballs
  were protruding out of a great pale mask.'</p>

  <p>'The stiffness extends to the figure a little, I think,' said Payne. 'They
  hadn't quite mastered anatomy when medievalism ended, at least in the north.
  That left leg looks to me a good deal out of drawing.'</p>

  <p>'I'm not so sure,' replied Wood quietly. 'Those fellows who painted just
  when realism began to be done, and before it began to be overdone, were often
  more realistic than we think. They put real details of portraiture into
  things that are thought merely conventional. You might say this fellow's
  eyebrows or eye-sockets are a little lop-sided; but I bet if you knew him
  you'd find that one of his eyebrows did really stick up more than the other.
  And I shouldn't wonder if he was lame or something, and that black leg was
  meant to be crooked.'</p>

  <p>'What an old devil he looks!' burst out Payne suddenly. 'I trust his
  reverence will excuse my language.'</p>

  <p>'I believe in the devil, thank you,' said the priest with an inscrutable
  face. 'Curiously enough there was a legend that the devil was lame.'</p>

  <p>'I say,' protested Payne, 'you can't really mean that he was the devil;
  but who the devil was he?'</p>

  <p>'He was the Lord Darnaway under Henry VII and Henry VIII,' replied his
  companion. 'But there are curious legends about him, too; one of them is
  referred to in that inscription round the frame, and further developed in
  some notes left by somebody in a book I found here. They are both rather
  curious reading.'</p>

  <p>Payne leaned forward, craning his head so as to follow the archaic
  inscription round the frame. Leaving out the antiquated lettering and
  spelling, it seemed to be a sort of rhyme running somewhat thus:</p><br>

  <p class="smcap" style="text-align:center">
  In the seventh heir I shall return:<br>
  In the seventh hour I shall depart:<br>
  None in that hour shall hold my hand:<br>
  And woe to her that holds my heart.</p><br>

  <p>'It sounds creepy somehow,' said Payne, 'but that may be partly because I
  don't understand a word of it.'</p>

  <p>'It's pretty creepy even when you do,' said Wood in a low voice. 'The
  record made at a later date, in the old book I found, is all about how this
  beauty deliberately killed himself in such a way that his wife was executed
  for his murder. Another note commemorates a later tragedy, seven successions
  later&mdash;under the Georges&mdash;in which another Darnaway committed
  suicide, having first thoughtfully left poison in his wife's wine. It's said
  that both suicides took place at seven in the evening. I suppose the
  inference is that he does really return with every seventh inheritor and
  makes things unpleasant, as the rhyme suggests, for any lady unwise enough to
  marry him.'</p>

  <p>'On that argument,' replied Payne, 'it would be a trifle uncomfortable for
  the next seventh gentleman.'</p>

  <p>Wood's voice was lower still as he said: 'The new heir will be the
  seventh.'</p>

  <p>Harry Payne suddenly heaved up his great chest and shoulders like a man
  flinging off a burden.</p>

  <p>'What crazy stuff are we all talking?' he cried. 'We're all educated men
  in an enlightened age, I suppose. Before I came into this damned dank
  atmosphere I'd never have believed I should be talking of such things, except
  to laugh at them.'</p>

  <p>'You are right,' said Wood. 'If you lived long enough in this underground
  palace you'd begin to feel differently about things. I've begun to feel very
  curiously about that picture, having had so much to do with handling and
  hanging it. It sometimes seems to me that the painted face is more alive than
  the dead faces of the people living here; that it is a sort of talisman or
  magnet: that it commands the elements and draws out the destinies of men and
  things. I suppose you would call it very fanciful.'</p>

  <p>'What is that noise?' cried Payne suddenly.</p>

  <p>They all listened, and there seemed to be no noise except the dull boom of
  the distant sea; then they began to have the sense of something mingling with
  it; something like a voice calling through the sound of the surf, dulled by
  it at first, but coming nearer and nearer. The next moment they were certain:
  someone was shouting outside in the dusk.</p>

  <p>Payne turned to the low window behind him and bent to look out. It was the
  window from which nothing could be seen except the moat with its reflection
  of bank and sky. But that inverted vision was not the same that he had seen
  before. From the hanging shadow of the bank in the water depended two dark
  shadows reflected from the feet and legs of a figure standing above upon the
  bank. Through that limited aperture they could see nothing but the two legs
  black against the reflection of a pale and livid sunset. But somehow that
  very fact of the head being invisible, as if in the clouds, gave something
  dreadful to the sound that followed; the voice of a man crying aloud what
  they could not properly hear or understand. Payne especially was peering out
  of the little window with an altered face, and he spoke with an altered
  voice:</p>

  <p>'How queerly he's standing!'</p>

  <p>'No, no,' said Wood, in a sort of soothing whisper. 'Things often look
  like that in reflection. It's the wavering of the water that makes you think
  that.'</p>

  <p>'Think what?' asked the priest shortly.</p>

  <p>'That his left leg is crooked,' said Wood.</p>

  <p>Payne had thought of the oval window as a sort of mystical mirror; and it
  seemed to him that there were in it other inscrutable images of doom. There
  was something else beside the figure that he did not understand; three
  thinner legs showing in dark lines against the light, as if some monstrous
  three-legged spider or bird were standing beside the stranger. Then he had
  the less crazy thought of a tripod like that of the heathen oracles; and the
  next moment the thing had vanished and the legs of the human figure passed
  out of the picture.</p>

  <p>He turned to meet the pale face of old Vine, the steward, with his mouth
  open, eager to speak, and his single tooth showing. 'He has come,' he said.
  'The boat arrived from Australia this morning.'</p>

  <p>Even as they went back out of the library into the central salon they
  heard the footsteps of the newcomer clattering down the entrance steps, with
  various items of light luggage trailed behind him. When Payne saw one of
  them, he laughed with a reaction of relief. His tripod was nothing but the
  telescopic legs of a portable camera, easily packed and unpacked; and the man
  who was carrying it seemed so far to take on equally solid and normal
  qualities. He was dressed in dark clothes, but of a careless and holiday
  sort; his shirt was of grey flannel, and his boots echoed uncompromisingly
  enough in those still chambers. As he strode forward to greet his new circle
  his stride had scarcely more than the suggestion of a limp. But Payne and his
  companions were looking at his face, and could scarcely take their eyes from
  it.</p>

  <p>He evidently felt there was something curious and uncomfortable about his
  reception; but they could have sworn that he did not himself know the cause
  of it. The lady, supposed to be in some sense already betrothed to him, was
  certainly beautiful enough to attract him; but she evidently also frightened
  him. The old steward brought him a sort of feudal homage, yet treated him as
  if he were the family ghost. The priest still looked at him with a face which
  was quite indecipherable, and therefore perhaps all the more unnerving. A new
  sort of irony, more like the Greek irony, began to pass over Payne's mind. He
  had dreamed of the stranger as a devil, but it seemed almost worse that he
  was an unconscious destiny. He seemed to march towards crime with the
  monstrous innocence of Oedipus. He had approached the family mansion in so
  blindly buoyant a spirit as to have set up his camera to photograph his first
  sight of it; and even the camera had taken on the semblance of the tripod of
  a tragic pythoness.</p>

  <p>Payne was surprised, when taking his leave a little while after, at
  something which showed that the Australian was already less unconscious of
  his surroundings. He said in a low voice:</p>

  <p>'Don't go ... or come again soon. You look like a human being. This place
  fairly gives me the jumps.'</p>

  <p>When Payne emerged out of those almost subterranean halls and came into
  the night air and the smell of the sea, he felt as if he had come out of that
  underworld of dreams in which events jumble on top of each other in a way at
  once unrestful and unreal.</p>

  <p>The arrival of the strange relative had been somehow unsatisfying and, as
  it were, unconvincing. The doubling of the same face in the old portrait and
  the new arrival troubled him like a two headed monster. And yet it was not
  altogether a nightmare; nor was it that face, perhaps, that he saw most
  vividly.</p>

  <p>'Did you say?' he asked of the doctor, as they strode together across the
  striped dark sands by the darkening sea; 'did you say that young man was
  betrothed to Miss Darnaway by a family compact or something? Sounds rather
  like a novel.'</p>

  <p>'But an historical novel,' answered Dr Barnet. 'The Darnaways all went to
  sleep a few centuries ago, when things were really done that we only read of
  in romances. Yes; I believe there's some family tradition by which second or
  third cousins always marry when they stand in a certain relation of age, in
  order to unite the property. A damned silly tradition, I should say; and if
  they often married in and in, in that fashion, it may account on principles
  of heredity for their having gone so rotten.'</p>

  <p>'I should hardly say,' answered Payne a little stuffily, 'that they had
  all gone rotten.'</p>

  <p>'Well,' replied the doctor, 'the young man doesn't look rotten, of course,
  though he's certainly lame.'</p>

  <p>'The young man!' cried Payne, who was suddenly and unreasonably angry.
  'Well, if you think the young lady looks rotten, I think it's you who have
  rotten taste.'</p>

  <p>The doctor's face grew dark and bitter. 'I fancy I know more about it than
  you do,' he snapped.</p>

  <p>They completed the walk in silence, each feeling that he had been
  irrationally rude and had suffered equally irrational rudeness; and Payne was
  left to brood alone on the matter, for his friend Wood had remained behind to
  attend to some of his business in connexion with the pictures.</p>

  <p>Payne took very full advantage of the invitation extended by the colonial
  cousin, who wanted somebody to cheer him up. During the next few weeks he saw
  a good deal of the dark interior of the Darnaway home; though it might be
  said that he did not confine himself entirely to cheering up the colonial
  cousin. The lady's melancholy was of longer standing and perhaps needed more
  lifting; anyhow, he showed a laborious readiness to lift it. He was not
  without a conscience, however, and the situation made him doubtful and
  uncomfortable. Weeks went by and nobody could discover from the demeanour of
  the new Darnaway whether he considered himself engaged according to the old
  compact or no. He went mooning about the dark galleries and stood staring
  vacantly at the dark and sinister picture. The shades of that prison-house
  were certainly beginning to close on him, and there was little of his
  Australian assurance left. But Payne could discover nothing upon the point
  that concerned him most. Once he attempted to confide in his friend Martin
  Wood, as he was pottering about in his capacity of picture-hanger; but even
  out of him he got very little satisfaction.</p>

  <p>'It seems to me you can't butt in,' said Wood shortly, 'because of the
  engagement.'</p>

  <p>'Of course I shan't butt in if there is an engagement,' retorted his
  friend; 'but is there? I haven't said a word to her of course; but I've seen
  enough of her to be pretty certain she doesn't think there is, even if she
  thinks there may be. He doesn't say there is, or even hint that there ought
  to be. It seems to me this shillyshallying is rather unfair on
  everybody.'</p>

  <p>'Especially on you, I suppose,' said Wood a little harshly. 'But if you
  ask me, I'll tell you what I think&mdash;I think he's afraid.'</p>

  <p>'Afraid of being refused?' asked Payne.</p>

  <p>'No; afraid of being accepted,' answered the other. 'Don't bite my head
  off&mdash;I don't mean afraid of the lady. I mean afraid of the picture.'</p>

  <p>'Afraid of the picture!' repeated Payne.</p>

  <p>'I mean afraid of the curse,' said Wood. 'Don't you remember the rhyme
  about the Darnaway doom falling on him and her.'</p>

  <p>'Yes, but look here,' cried Payne; 'even the Darnaway doom can't have it
  both ways. You tell me first that I mustn't have my own way because of the
  compact, and then that the compact mustn't have its own way because of the
  curse. But if the curse can destroy the compact, why should she be tied to
  the compact? If they're frightened of marrying each other, they're free to
  marry anybody else, and there's an end of it. Why should I suffer for the
  observance of something they don't propose to observe? It seems to me your
  position is very unreasonable.'</p>

  <p>'Of course it's all a tangle,' said Wood rather crossly, and went on
  hammering at the frame of a canvas.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, one morning, the new heir broke his long and baffling silence.
  He did it in a curious fashion, a little crude, as was his way, but with an
  obvious anxiety to do the right thing. He asked frankly for advice, not of
  this or that individual as Payne had done, but collectively as of a crowd.
  When he did speak he threw himself on the whole company like a statesman
  going to the country. He called it 'a show-down'. Fortunately the lady was
  not included in this large gesture; and Payne shuddered when he thought of
  her feelings. But the Australian was quite honest; he thought the natural
  thing was to ask for help and for information, calling a sort of family
  council at which he put his cards on the table. It might be said that he
  flung down his cards on the table, for he did it with a rather desperate air,
  like one who had been harassed for days and nights by the increasing pressure
  of a problem. In that short time the shadows of that place of low windows and
  sinking pavements had curiously changed him, and increased a certain
  resemblance that crept through all their memories.</p>

  <p>The five men, including the doctor, were sitting round a table; and Payne
  was idly reflecting that his own light tweeds and red hair must be the only
  colours in the room, for the priest and the steward were in black, and Wood
  and Darnaway habitually wore dark grey suits that looked almost like black.
  Perhaps this incongruity had been what the young man had meant by calling him
  a human being. At that moment the young man himself turned abruptly in his
  chair and began to talk. A moment after the dazed artist knew that he was
  talking about the most tremendous thing in the world.</p>

  <p>'Is there anything in it?' he was saying. 'That is what I've come to
  asking myself till I'm nearly crazy. I'd never have believed I should come to
  thinking of such things; but I think of the portrait and the rhyme and the
  coincidences or whatever you call them, and I go cold. Is there anything in
  it? Is there any Doom of the Darnaways or only a damned queer accident? Have
  I got a right to marry, or shall I bring something big and black out of the
  sky, that I know nothing about, on myself and somebody else?'</p>

  <p>His rolling eye had roamed round the table and rested on the plain face of
  the priest, to whom he now seemed to be speaking. Payne's submerged
  practicality rose in protest against the problem of superstition being
  brought before that supremely superstitious tribunal. He was sitting next to
  Darnaway and struck in before the priest could answer.</p>

  <p>'Well, the coincidences are curious, I admit,' he said, rather forcing a
  note of cheerfulness; 'but surely we&mdash;' and then he stopped as if he had
  been struck by lightning. For Darnaway had turned his head sharply over his
  shoulder at the interruption, and with the movement, his left eyebrow jerked
  up far above its fellow and for an instant the face of the portrait glared at
  him with a ghastly exaggeration of exactitude. The rest saw it; and all had
  the air of having been dazzled by an instant of light. The old steward gave a
  hollow groan.</p>

  <p>'It is no good,' he said hoarsely;' we are dealing with something too
  terrible.'</p>

  <p>'Yes,' assented the priest in a low voice, 'we are dealing with something
  terrible; with the most terrible thing I know, and the name of it is
  nonsense.'</p>

  <p>'What did you say?' said Darnaway, still looking towards him.</p>

  <p>'I said nonsense,' repeated the priest. 'I have not said anything in
  particular up to now, for it was none of my business; I was only taking
  temporary duty in the neighbourhood and Miss Darnaway wanted to see me. But
  since you're asking me personally and point-blank, why, it's easy enough to
  answer. Of course there's no Doom of the Darnaways to prevent your marrying
  anybody you have any decent reason for marrying. A man isn't fated to fall
  into the smallest venial sin, let alone into crimes like suicide and murder.
  You can't be made to do wicked things against your will because your name is
  Darnaway, any more than I can because my name is Brown. The Doom of the
  Browns,' he added with relish&mdash;'the Weird of the Browns would sound even
  better.'</p>

  <p>'And you of all people,' repeated the Australian, staring, 'tell me to
  think like that about it.'</p>

  <p>'I tell you to think about something else,' replied the priest cheerfully.
  'What has become of the rising art of photography? How is the camera getting
  on? I know it's rather dark downstairs, but those hollow arches on the floor
  above could easily be turned into a first-rate photographic studio. A few
  workmen could fit it out with a glass roof in no time.'</p>

  <p>'Really,' protested Martin Wood, 'I do think you should be the last man in
  the world to tinker about with those beautiful Gothic arches, which are about
  the best work your own religion has ever done in the world. I should have
  thought you'd have had some feeling for that sort of art; but I can't see why
  you should be so uncommonly keen on photography.'</p>

  <p>'I'm uncommonly keen on daylight,' answered Father Brown, 'especially in
  this dingy business; and photography has the virtue of depending on daylight.
  And if you don't know that I would grind all the Gothic arches in the world
  to powder to save the sanity of a single human soul, you don't know so much
  about my religion as you think you do.'</p>

  <p>The young Australian had sprung to his feet like a man rejuvenated. 'By
  George! that's the talk,' he cried; 'though I never thought to hear it from
  that quarter. I'll tell you what, reverend sir, I'll do something that will
  show I haven't lost my courage after all.'</p>

  <p>The old steward was still looking at him with quaking watchfulness, as if
  he felt something fey about the young man's defiance. 'Oh,' he cried, 'what
  are you going to do now?'</p>

  <p>'I am going to photograph the portrait,' replied Darnaway.</p>

  <p>Yet it was barely a week afterwards that the storm of the catastrophe
  seemed to stoop out of the sky, darkening that sun of sanity to which the
  priest had appealed in vain, and plunging the mansion once more in the
  darkness of the Darnaway doom. It had been easy enough to fit up the new
  studio; and seen from inside it looked very like any other such studio, empty
  except for the fullness of the white light. A man coming from the gloomy
  rooms below had more than normally the sense of stepping into a more than
  modern brilliancy, as blank as the future. At the suggestion of Wood, who
  knew the castle well and had got over his first aesthetic grumblings, a small
  room remaining intact in the upper ruins was easily turned into a dark room,
  into which Darnaway went out of the white daylight to grope by the crimson
  gleams of a red lamp. Wood said, laughing, that the red lamp had reconciled
  him to the vandalism; as that bloodshot darkness was as romantic as an
  alchemist's cave.</p>

  <p>Darnaway had risen at daybreak on the day that he meant to photograph the
  mysterious portrait, and had it carried up from the library by the single
  corkscrew staircase that connected the two floors. There he had set it up in
  the wide white daylight on a sort of easel and planted his photographic
  tripod in front of it. He said he was anxious to send a reproduction of it to
  a great antiquary who had written on the antiquities of the house; but the
  others knew that this was an excuse covering much deeper things. It was, if
  not exactly a spiritual duel between Darnaway and the demoniac picture, at
  least a duel between Darnaway and his own doubts. He wanted to bring the
  daylight of photography face to face with that dark masterpiece of painting;
  and to see whether the sunshine of the new art would not drive out the
  shadows of the old.</p>

  <p>Perhaps this was why he preferred to do it by himself, even if some of the
  details seemed to take longer and involve more than normal delay. Anyhow, he
  rather discouraged the few who visited his studio during the day of the
  experiment, and who found him focusing and fussing about in a very isolated
  and impenetrable fashion. The steward had left a meal for him, as he refused
  to come down; the old gentleman also returned some hours afterwards and found
  the meal more or less normally disposed of; but when he brought it he got no
  more gratitude than a grunt. Payne went up once to see how he was getting on,
  but finding the photographer disinclined for conversation came down again.
  Father Brown had wandered that way in an unobtrusive style to lake Darnaway a
  letter from the expert to whom the photograph was to be sent. But he left the
  letter on a tray, and whatever he thought of that great glasshouse full of
  daylight and devotion to a hobby, a world he had himself in some sense
  created, he kept it to himself and came down. He had reason to remember very
  soon that he was the last to come down the solitary staircase connecting the
  floors, leaving a lonely man and an empty room behind him. The others were
  standing in the salon that led into the library, just under the great black
  ebony clock that looked like a titanic coffin.</p>

  <p>'How was Darnaway getting on,' asked Payne, a little later, 'when you last
  went up?'</p>

  <p>The priest passed a hand over his forehead. 'Don't tell me I'm getting
  psychic,' he said with a sad smile. 'I believe I'm quite dazzled with
  daylight up in that room and couldn't see things straight. Honestly, I felt
  for a flash as if there were something uncanny about Darnaway's figure
  standing before that portrait.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, that's the lame leg,' said Barnet promptly. 'We know all about
  that.'</p>

  <p>'Do you know,' said Payne abruptly, but lowering his voice, 'l don't think
  we do know all about it or anything about it. What's the matter with his leg?
  What was the matter with his ancestor's leg?'</p>

  <p>'Oh, there's something about that in the book I was reading in there, in
  the family archives,' said Wood; 'I'll fetch it for you.' And he stepped into
  the library just beyond.</p>

  <p>'I think,' said Father Brown quietly, 'Mr Payne must have some particular
  reason for asking that.'</p>

  <p>'I may as well blurt it out once and for all,' said Payne, but in a yet
  lower voice. 'After all, there is a rational explanation. A man from anywhere
  might have made up to look like the portrait. What do we know about Darnaway?
  He is behaving rather oddly&mdash;'</p>

  <p>The others were staring at him in a rather startled fashion; but the
  priest seemed to take it very calmly.</p>

  <p>'I don't think the old portrait's ever been photographed,' he said.
  'That's why he wants to do it. I don't think there's anything odd about
  that.'</p>

  <p>'Quite an ordinary state of things, in fact,' said Wood with a smile; he
  had just returned with the book in his hand. And even as he spoke there was a
  stir in the clockwork of the great dark clock behind him and successive
  strokes thrilled through the room up to the number of seven. With the last
  stroke there came a crash from the floor above that shook the house like a
  thunderbolt; and Father Brown was already two steps up the winding staircase
  before the sound had ceased.</p>

  <p>'My God!' cried Payne involuntarily; 'he is alone up there.'</p>

  <p>'Yes,' said Father Brown without turning, as he vanished up the stairway.
  'We shall find him alone.'</p>

  <p>When the rest recovered from their first paralysis and ran helter-skelter
  up the stone steps and found their way to the new studio, it was true
  in that sense that they found him alone. They found him lying in a wreck of
  his tall camera, with its long splintered legs standing out grotesquely at
  three different angles; and Darnaway had fallen on top of it with one black
  crooked leg lying at a fourth angle along the floor. For the moment the dark
  heap looked as if he were entangled with some huge and horrible spider.
  Little more than a glance and a touch were needed to tell them that he was
  dead. Only the portrait stood untouched upon the easel, and one could fancy
  the smiling eyes shone.</p>

  <p>An hour afterwards Father Brown in helping to calm the confusion of the
  stricken household, came upon the old steward muttering almost as
  mechanically as the clock had ticked and struck the terrible hour. Almost
  without hearing them, he knew what the muttered words must be.</p>

  <p>In the seventh heir I shall return In the seventh hour I shall depart.</p>

  <p>As he was about to say something soothing, the old man seemed suddenly to
  start awake and stiffen into anger; his mutterings changed to a fierce
  cry.</p>

  <p>'You!' he cried; 'you and your daylight! Even you won't say now there is
  no Doom for the Darnaways.'</p>

  <p>'My opinion about that is unchanged,' said Father Brown mildly. Then after
  a pause he added: 'I hope you will observe poor Darnaway's last wish, and see
  the photograph is sent off.'</p>

  <p>'The photograph!' cried the doctor sharply. 'What's the good of that? As a
  matter of fact, it's rather curious; but there isn't any photograph. It seems
  he never took it after all, after pottering about all day.'</p>

  <p>Father Brown swung round sharply. 'Then take it yourselves,' he said.
  'Poor Darnaway was perfectly right. It's most important that the photograph
  should be taken.'</p>

  <p>As all the visitors, the doctor, the priest, and the two artists trailed
  away in a black and dismal procession across the brown and yellow sands, they
  were at first more or less silent, rather as if they had been stunned. And
  certainly there had been something like a crack of thunder in a clear sky
  about the fulfilment of that forgotten superstition at the very time when
  they had most forgotten it; when the doctor and the priest had both filled
  their minds with rationalism as the photographer had filled his rooms with
  daylight. They might be as rationalistic as they liked; but in broad daylight
  the seventh heir had returned, and in broad daylight at the seventh hour he
  had perished.</p>

  <p>'I'm afraid everybody will always believe in the Darnaway superstition
  now,' said Martin Wood.</p>

  <p>'I know one who won't,' said the doctor sharply. 'Why should I indulge in
  superstition because somebody else indulges in suicide?'</p>

  <p>'You think poor Mr Darnaway committed suicide?' asked the priest.</p>

  <p>'I'm sure he committed suicide,' replied the doctor.</p>

  <p>'It is possible,' agreed the other.</p>

  <p>'He was quite alone up there, and he had a whole drug-store of poisons in
  the dark room. Besides, it's just the sort of thing that Darnaways do.'</p>

  <p>'You don't think there's anything in the fulfilment of the family
  curse?'</p>

  <p>'Yes,' said the doctor; 'I believe in one family curse, and that is the
  family constitution. I told you it was heredity, and they are all half mad.
  If you stagnate and breed in and brood in your own swamp like that, you're
  bound to degenerate whether you like it or not. The laws of heredity can't be
  dodged; the truths of science can't be denied. The minds of the Darnaways are
  falling to pieces, as their blighted old sticks and stones are falling to
  pieces, eaten away by the sea and the salt air. Suicide&mdash;of course he
  committed suicide; I dare say all the rest will commit suicide. Perhaps the
  best thing they could do.'</p>

  <p>As the man of science spoke there sprang suddenly and with startling
  clearness into Payne's memory the face of the daughter of the Darnaways, a
  tragic mask pale against an unfathomable blackness, but itself of a blinding
  and more than mortal beauty. He opened his mouth to speak and found himself
  speechless.</p>

  <p>'I see,' said Father Brown to the doctor; 'so you do believe in the
  superstition after all?'</p>

  <p>'What do you mean&mdash;believe in the superstition? I believe in the
  suicide as a matter of scientific necessity.'</p>

  <p>'Well,' replied the priest, 'I don't see a pin to choose between your
  scientific superstition and the other magical superstition. They both seem to
  end in turning people into paralytics, who can't move their own legs or arms
  or save their own lives or souls. The rhyme said it was the Doom of the
  Darnaways to be killed, and the scientific textbook says it is the Doom of
  the Darnaways to kill themselves. Both ways they seem to be slaves.'</p>

  <p>'But I thought you said you believed in rational views of these things,'
  said Dr Barnet. 'Don't you believe in heredity?'</p>

  <p>'I said I believed in daylight,' replied the priest in a loud and clear
  voice, 'and I won't choose between two tunnels of subterranean superstition
  that both end in the dark. And the proof of it is this: that you are all
  entirely in the dark about what really happened in that house.'</p>

  <p>'Do you mean about the suicide?' asked Payne.</p>

  <p>'I mean about the murder,' said Father Brown; and his voice, though only
  slightly lifted to a louder note, seemed somehow to resound over the whole
  shore.' It was murder; but murder is of the will, which God made free.'</p>

  <p>What the other said at the moment in answer to it Payne never knew. For
  the word had a rather curious effect on him; stirring him like the blast of a
  trumpet and yet bringing him to a halt. He stood still in the middle of the
  sandy waste and let the others go on in front of him; he felt the blood
  crawling through all his veins and the sensation that is called the hair
  standing on end; and yet he felt a new and unnatural happiness. A
  psychological process too quick and too complicated for himself to follow had
  already reached a conclusion that he could not analyse; but the conclusion
  was one of relief. After standing still for a moment he turned and went back
  slowly across the sands to the house of the Darnaways.</p>

  <p>He crossed the moat with a stride that shook the bridge, descended the
  stairs and traversed the long rooms with a resounding tread, till he came to
  the place where Adelaide Darnaway sat haloed with the low light of the oval
  window, almost like some forgotten saint left behind in the land of death.
  She looked up, and an expression of wonder made her face yet more
  wonderful.</p>

  <p>'What is it?' she said.' Why have you come back?'</p>

  <p>'I have come for the Sleeping Beauty,' he said in a tone that had the
  resonance of a laugh. 'This old house went to sleep long ago, as the doctor
  said; but it is silly for you to pretend to be old. Come up into the daylight
  and hear the truth. I have brought you a word; it is a terrible word, but it
  breaks the spell of your captivity.'</p>

  <p>She did not understand a word he said, but something made her rise and let
  him lead her down the long hall and up the stairs and out under the evening
  sky. The ruins of a dead garden stretched towards the sea, and an old
  fountain with the figure of a triton, green with rust, remained poised there,
  pouring nothing out of a dried horn into an empty basin. He had often seen
  that desolate outline against the evening sky as he passed, and it had seemed
  to him a type of fallen fortunes in more ways than one. Before long,
  doubtless, those hollow fonts would be filled, but it would be with the pale
  green bitter waters of the sea and the flowers would be drowned and strangled
  in seaweed. So, he had told himself, the daughter of the Darnaways might
  indeed be wedded; but she would be wedded to death and a doom as deaf and
  ruthless as the sea. But now he laid a hand on the bronze triton that was
  like the hand of a giant, and shook it as if he meant to hurl it over like an
  idol or an evil god of the garden.</p>

  <p>'What do you mean?' she asked steadily. 'What is this word that will set
  us free?'</p>

  <p>'The word is murder,' he said, 'and the freedom it brings is as fresh as
  the flowers of spring. No; I do not mean I have murdered anybody. But the
  fact that anybody can be murdered is itself good news, after the evil dreams
  you have been living in. Don't you understand? In that dream of yours
  everything that happened to you came from inside you; the Doom of the
  Darnaways was stored up in the Darnaways; it unfolded itself like a horrible
  flower. There was no escape even by happy accident; it was all inevitable;
  whether it was Vine and his old-wives' tales, or Barnet and his new-fangled
  heredity. But this man who died was not the victim of a magic curse or an
  inherited madness. He was murdered; and for us that murder is simply an
  accident; yes, requiescat in pace: but a happy accident. It is a ray of
  daylight, because it comes from outside.'</p>

  <p>She suddenly smiled. 'Yes, I believe I understand. I suppose you are
  talking like a lunatic, but I understand. But who murdered him?'</p>

  <p>'I do not know,' he answered calmly, 'but Father Brown knows. And as
  Father Brown says, murder is at least done by the will, free as that wind
  from the sea.'</p>

  <p>'Father Brown is a wonderful person,' she said after a pause; 'he was the
  only person who ever brightened my existence in any way at all
until&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Until what?' asked Payne, and made a movement almost impetuous, leaning
  towards her and thrusting away the bronze monster so that it seemed to rock
  on its pedestal.</p>

  <p>'Well, until you did,' she said and smiled again.</p>

  <p>So was the sleeping palace awakened, and it is no part of this story to
  describe the stages of its awakening, though much of it had come to pass
  before the dark of that evening had fallen upon the shore. As Harry Payne
  strode homewards once more, across those dark sands that he had crossed in so
  many moods, he was at the highest turn of happiness that is given in this
  mortal life,&mdash;and the whole red sea within him was at the top of its
  tide. He would have had no difficulty in picturing all that place again in
  flower, and the bronze triton bright as a golden god and the fountain flowing
  with water or with wine. But all this brightness and blossoming had been
  unfolded for him by the one word 'murder', and it was still a word that he
  did not understand. He had taken it on trust, and he was not unwise; for he
  was one of those who have a sense of the sound of truth.</p>

  <p>It was more than a month later that Payne returned to his London house to
  keep an appointment with Father Brown, taking the required photograph with
  him. His personal romance had prospered as well as was fitting under the
  shadow of such a tragedy, and the shadow itself therefore lay rather more
  lightly on him; but it was hard to view it as anything but the shadow of a
  family fatality. In many ways he had been much occupied; and it was not until
  the Darnaway household had resumed its somewhat stern routine, and the
  portrait had long been restored to its place in the library, that he had
  managed to photograph it with a magnesium flare. Before sending it to the
  antiquary, as originally arranged, he brought it to the priest who had so
  pressingly demanded it.</p>

  <p>'I can't understand your attitude about all this. Father Brown,' he said.'
  You act as if you had already solved the problem in some way of your
  own.'</p>

  <p>The priest shook his head mournfully. 'Not a bit of it,' he answered. 'I
  must be very stupid, but I'm quite stuck; stuck about the most practical
  point of all. It's a queer business; so simple up to a point and
then&mdash;Let
  me have a look at that photograph, will you?'</p>

  <p>He held it close to his screwed, short-sighted eyes for a moment, and then
  said: 'Have you got a magnifying glass?'</p>

  <p>Payne produced one, and the priest looked through it intently for some
  time and then said:' Look at the title of that book at the edge of the
  bookshelf beside the frame; it's 'The History of Pope Joan'. Now, I wonder
  ... yes, by George; and the one above is something or other of Iceland. Lord!
  what a queer way to find it out! What a dolt and donkey I was not to notice
  it when I was there!'</p>

  <p>'But what have you found out?' asked Payne impatiently.</p>

  <p>'The last link,' said Father Brown, 'and I'm not stuck any longer. Yes; I
  think I know how that unhappy story went from first to last now.'</p>

  <p>'But why?' insisted the other.</p>

  <p>'Why, because,' said the priest with a smile, 'the Darnaway library
  contained books about Pope Joan and Iceland, not to mention another I see
  with the title beginning 'The Religion of Frederick', which is not so very
  hard to fill up.' Then, seeing the other's annoyance, his smile faded and he
  said more earnestly: 'As a matter of fact, this last point, though it is the
  last link, is not the main business. There were much more curious things in
  the case than that. One of them is rather a curiosity of evidence. Let me
  begin by saying something that may surprise you. Darnaway did not die at
  seven o'clock that evening. He had been already dead for a whole day.'</p>

  <p>'Surprise is rather a mild word,' said Payne grimly, 'since you and I both
  saw him walking about afterwards.'</p>

  <p>'No, we did not,' replied Father Brown quietly. 'I think we both saw him,
  or thought we saw him, fussing about with the focusing of his camera. Wasn't
  his head under that black cloak when you passed through the room? It was when
  I did. And that's why I felt there was something queer about the room and the
  figure. It wasn't that the leg was crooked, but rather that it wasn't
  crooked. It was dressed in the same sort of dark clothes; but if you see what
  you believe to be one man standing in the way that another man stands, you
  will think he's in a strange and strained attitude.'</p>

  <p>'Do you really mean,' cried Payne with something like a shudder, 'that it
  was some unknown man?'</p>

  <p>'It was the murderer,' said Father Brown. 'He had already killed Darnaway
  at daybreak and hid the corpse and himself in the dark room&mdash;an excellent
  hiding-place, because nobody normally goes into it or can see much if he
  does. But he let it fall out on the floor at seven o'clock, of course, that
  the whole thing might be explained by the curse.'</p>

  <p>'But I don't understand' observed Payne. 'Why didn't he kill him at seven
  o'clock then, instead of loading himself with a corpse for fourteen
  hours?'</p>

  <p>'Let me ask you another question,' said the priest. 'Why was there no
  photograph taken? Because the murderer made sure of killing him when he first
  got up, and before he could take it. It was essential to the murderer to
  prevent that photograph reaching the expert on the Darnaway antiquities.'</p>

  <p>There was a sudden silence for a moment, and then the priest went on in a
  lower tone: 'Don't you see how simple it is? Why, you yourself saw one side
  of the possibility; but it's simpler even than you thought. You said a man
  might be faked to resemble an old picture. Surely it's simpler that a picture
  should be faked to resemble a man. In plain words, it's true in a rather
  special way that there was no Doom of the Darnaways. There was no old
  picture; there was no old rhyme; there was no legend of a man who caused his
  wife's death. But there was a very wicked and a very clever man who was
  willing to cause another man's death in order to rob him of his promised
  wife.'</p>

  <p>The priest suddenly gave Payne a sad smile, as if in reassurance. 'For the
  moment I believe you thought I meant you,' he said,' but you were not the
  only person who haunted that house for sentimental reasons. You know the man,
  or rather you think you do. But there were depths in the man called Martin
  Wood, artist and antiquary, which none of his mere artistic acquaintances
  were likely to guess. Remember that he was called in to criticize and
  catalogue the pictures; in an aristocratic dustbin of that sort that
  practically means simply to tell the Darnaways what art treasures they had
  got. They would not be surprised at things turning up they had never noticed
  before. It had to be done well, and it was; perhaps he was right when he said
  that if it wasn't Holbein it was somebody of the same genius.'</p>

  <p>'I feel rather stunned,' said Payne; 'and there are twenty things I don't
  see yet. How did he know what Darnaway looked like? How did he actually kill
  him? The doctors seem rather puzzled at present.'</p>

  <p>'I saw a photograph the lady had which the Australian sent on before him,'
  said the priest, 'and there are several ways in which he could have learned
  things when the new heir was once recognized. We may not know these details;
  but they are not difficulties. You remember he used to help in the dark room;
  it seems to me an ideal place, say, to prick a man with a poisoned pin, with
  the poison's all handy. No; I say these were not difficulties. The difficulty
  that stumped me was how Wood could be in two places at once. How could he
  take the corpse from the dark-room and prop it against the camera so that
  it would fall in a few seconds, without coming downstairs, when he was in the
  library looking out a book? And I was such a fool that I never looked at the
  books in the library; and it was only in this photograph, by very undeserved
  good luck, that I saw the simple fact of a book about Pope Joan.'</p>

  <p>'You've kept your best riddle for the end,' said Payne grimly. 'What on
  earth can Pope Joan have to do with it?'</p>

  <p>'Don't forget the book about the Something of Iceland,' advised the
  priest, 'or the religion of somebody called Frederick. It only remains to ask
  what sort of man was the late Lord Darnaway.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, does it?' observed Payne heavily.</p>

  <p>'He was a cultivated, humorous sort of eccentric, I believe,' went on
  Father Brown. 'Being cultivated, he knew there was no such person as Pope
  Joan. Being humorous, he was very likely to have thought of the title of 'The
  Snakes of Iceland' or something else that didn't exist. I venture to
  reconstruct the third title as 'The Religion of Frederick the
  Great'&mdash;which also doesn't exist. Now, doesn't it strike you that those
  would be just the titles to put on the backs of books that didn't exist; or
  in other words on a bookcase that wasn't a book-case?'</p>

  <p>'Ah!' cried Payne; 'I see what you mean now. There was some hidden
  staircase&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Up to the room Wood himself selected as a dark room,' said the priest
  nodding. 'I'm sorry. It couldn't be helped. It's dreadfully banal and stupid,
  as stupid as I have been on this pretty banal case. But we were mixed up in a
  real musty old romance of decayed gentility and a fallen family mansion; and
  it was too much to hope that we could escape having a secret passage. It was
  a priest's hole; and I deserve to be put in it.'</p>

  <h2><a id="story8"
     name="story8">VIII.&mdash;THE GHOST OF GIDEON WISE</a></h2>

<h3>(No record of prior magazine publication found)</h3>

  <p class="first">FATHER BROWN always regarded the case as the queerest
  example of the theory of an alibi: the theory by which it is maintained, in
  defiance of the mythological Irish bird, that it is impossible for anybody to
  be in two places at once. To begin with, James Byrne, being an Irish
  journalist, was perhaps the nearest approximation to the Irish bird. He came
  as near as anybody could to being in two places at once: for he was in two
  places at the opposite extremes of the social and political world within the
  space of twenty minutes. The first was in the Babylonian halls of the big
  hotel, which was the meeting place of the three commercial magnates concerned
  with arranging for a coal lock-out and denouncing it as a coal-strike, the
  second was in a curious tavern, having the facade of a grocery store, where
  met the more subterranean triumvirate of those who would have been very glad
  to turn the lock-out into a strike&mdash;and the strike into a revolution.
  The reporter passed to and fro between the three millionaires and the three
  Bolshevist leaders with the immunity of the modern herald or the new
  ambassador.</p>

  <p>He found the three mining magnates hidden in a jungle of flowering plants
  and a forest of fluted and florid columns of gilded plaster; gilded birdcages
  hung high under the painted domes amid the highest leaves of the palms; and
  in them were birds of motley colours and varied cries. No bird in the
  wilderness ever sang more unheeded, and no flower ever wasted its sweetness
  on the desert air more completely than the blossoms of those tall plants
  wasted theirs upon the brisk and breathless business men, mostly American,
  who talked and ran to and fro in that place. And there, amid a riot of rococo
  ornament that nobody ever looked at, and a chatter of expensive foreign birds
  that nobody ever heard, and a mass of gorgeous upholstery and a labyrinth of
  luxurious architecture, the three men sat and talked of how success was
  founded on thought and thrift and a vigilance of economy and self-control.</p>

  <p>One of them indeed did not talk so much as the others; but he watched with
  very bright and motionless eyes, which seemed to be pinched together by his
  pince-nez, and the permanent smile under his small black moustache was rather
  like a permanent sneer. This was the famous Jacob P. Stein, and he did not
  speak till he had something to say. But his companion, old Gallup the
  Pennsylvanian, a huge fat fellow with reverend grey hair but a face like a
  pugilist, talked a great deal. He was in a jovial mood and was half rallying,
  half bullying the third millionaire, Gideon Wise&mdash;a hard, dried, angular
  old bird of the type that his countrymen compare to hickory, with a stiff
  grey chin-beard and the manners and clothes of any old farmer from the
  central plains. There was an old argument between Wise and Gallup about
  combination and competition. For old Wise still retained, with the manners of
  the old backwoodsman, something of his opinions of the old individualist; he
  belonged, as we should say in England, to the Manchester School; and Gallup
  was always trying to persuade him to cut out competition and pool the
  resources of the world.</p>

  <p>'You'll have to come in, old fellow, sooner or later,' Gallup was saying
  genially as Byrne entered. 'It's the way the world is going, and we can't go
  back to the one-man-business now. We've all got to stand together.'</p>

  <p>'If I might say a word,' said Stein, in his tranquil way, 'I would say
  there is something a little more urgent even than standing together
  commercially. Anyhow, we must stand together politically; and that's why I've
  asked Mr Byrne to meet us here today. On the political issue we must combine;
  for the simple reason that all our most dangerous enemies are already
  combined.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, I quite agree about political combination,' grumbled Gideon Wise.</p>

  <p>'See here,' said Stein to the journalist; 'I know you have the run of
  these queer places, Mr Byrne, and I want you to do something for us
  unofficially. You know where these men meet; there are only two or three of
  them that count, John Elias and Jake Halket, who does all the spouting, and
  perhaps that poet fellow Home.'</p>

  <p>'Why Home used to be a friend of Gideon,' said the jeering Mr Gallup;
  'used to be in his Sunday School class or something.'</p>

  <p>'He was a Christian, then,' said old Gideon solemnly; 'but when a man
  takes up with atheists you never know. I still meet him now and then. I was
  quite ready to back him against war and conscription and all that, of course,
  but when it comes to all the goddam bolshies in creation&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Excuse me,' interposed Stein, 'the matter is rather urgent, so I hope you
  will excuse me putting it before Mr Byrne at once. Mr Byrne, I may tell you
  in confidence that I hold information, or rather evidence that would land at
  least two of those men in prison for long terms, in connexion with
  conspiracies during the late war. I don't want to use that evidence. But I
  want you to go to them quietly and tell them that I shall use it, and use it
  tomorrow, unless they alter their attitude.'</p>

  <p>'Well,' replied Byrne, 'what you propose would certainly be called
  compounding a felony and might be called blackmail, Don't you think it is
  rather dangerous?'</p>

  <p>'I think it is rather dangerous for them,' said Stein with a snap; 'and I
  want you to go and tell them so.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, very well,' said Byrne standing up, with a half humorous sigh. 'It's
  all in the day's work; but if I get into trouble, I warn you I shall try to
  drag you into it.'</p>

  <p>'You will try, boy,' said old Gallup with a hearty laugh.</p>

  <p>For so much still lingers of that great dream of Jefferson and, the thing
  that men have called Democracy that in his country, while the rich rule like
  tyrants, the poor do not talk like slaves; but there is candour between the
  oppressor and the oppressed.</p>

  <p>The meeting-place of the revolutionists was a queer, bare, whitewashed
  place, on the walls of which were one or two distorted uncouth sketches in
  black and white, in the style of something that was supposed to be
  Proletarian Art, of which not one proletarian in a million could have made
  head or tail. Perhaps the one point in common to the two council chambers was
  that both violated the American Constitution by the display of strong drink.
  Cocktails of various colours had stood before the three millionaires. Halket,
  the most violent of the Bolshevists, thought it only appropriate to drink
  vodka. He was a long, hulking fellow with a menacing stoop, and his very
  profile was aggressive like a dog's, the nose and lips thrust out together,
  the latter carrying a ragged red moustache and the whole curling outwards
  with perpetual scorn. John Elias was a dark watchful man in spectacles, with
  a black pointed beard; and he had learnt in many European cafes a taste for
  absinthe. The journalist's first and last feeling was how very like each
  other, after all, were John Elias and Jacob P. Stein. They were so like in
  face and mind and manner, that the millionaire might have disappeared down a
  trap-door in the Babylon Hotel and come up again in the stronghold of the
  Bolshevists.</p>

  <p>The third man also had a curious taste in drinks, and his drink was
  symbolic of him. For what stood in front of the poet Home was a glass of
  milk, and its very mildness seemed in that setting to have something sinister
  about it, as if its opaque and colourless colour were of some leprous paste
  more poisonous than the dead sick green of absinthe. Yet in truth the
  mildness was so far genuine enough; for Henry Home came to the camp of
  revolution along a very different road and from very different origins from
  those of Jake, the common tub-thumper, and Elias, the cosmopolitan
  wire-puller. He had had what is called a careful upbringing, had gone to
  chapel in his childhood, and carried through life a teetotalism which he
  could not shake off when he cast away such trifles as Christianity and
  marriage. He had fair hair and a fine face that might have looked like
  Shelley, if he had not weakened the chin with a little foreign fringe of
  beard. Somehow the beard made him look more like a woman; it was as if those
  few golden hairs were all he could do.</p>

  <p>When the journalist entered, the notorious Jake was talking, as he
  generally was. Home had uttered some casual and conventional phrase about
  'Heaven forbid' something or other, and this was quite enough to set Jake off
  with a torrent of profanity.</p>

  <p>'Heaven forbid! and that's about all it bally well does do,' he said.
  'Heaven never does anything but forbid this, that and the other; forbids us
  to strike, and forbids us to fight, and forbids us to shoot the damned
  usurers and blood-suckers where they sit. Why doesn't Heaven forbid them
  something for a bit? Why don't the damned priests and parsons stand up and
  tell the truth about those brutes for a change? Why doesn't their precious
  God&mdash;'</p>

  <p>Elias allowed a gentle sigh, as of faint fatigue, to escape him.</p>

  <p>'Priests,' he said, 'belonged, as Marx has shown, to the feudal stage of
  economic development and are therefore no longer really any part of the
  problem. The part once played by the priest is now played by the capitalist
  expert and&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Yes,' interrupted the journalist, with his grim and ironic implacability,
  'and it's about time you knew that some of them are jolly expert in playing
  it.' And without moving his own eyes from the bright but dead eyes of Elias,
  he told him of the threat of Stein.</p>

  <p>'I was prepared for something of that sort,' said the smiling Elias
  without moving; 'I may say quite prepared.'</p>

  <p>'Dirty dogs!' exploded Jake. 'If a poor man said a thing like that he'd go
  to penal servitude. But I reckon they'll go somewhere worse before they
  guess. If they don't go to hell, I don't know where the hell they'll go
  to&mdash;'</p>

  <p>Home made a movement of protest, perhaps not so much at what the man was
  saying as at what he was going to say, and Elias cut the speech short with
  cold exactitude.</p>

  <p>'It is quite unnecessary for us,' he said, looking at Byrne steadily
  through his spectacles, 'to bandy threats with the other side. It is quite
  sufficient that their threats are quite ineffective so far as we are
  concerned. We also have made all our own arrangements, and some of them will
  not appear until they appear in motion. So far as we are concerned, an
  immediate rupture and an extreme trial of strength will be quite according to
  plan.'</p>

  <p>As he spoke in a quite quiet and dignified fashion, something in his
  motionless yellow face and his great goggles started a faint fear creeping up
  the journalist's spine. Halket's savage face might seem to have a snarl in
  its very silhouette when seen sideways; but when seen face to face, the
  smouldering rage in his eyes had also something of anxiety, as if the ethical
  and economic riddle were after all a little too much for him; and Home seemed
  even more hanging on wires of worry and self-criticism. But about this third
  man with the goggles, who spoke so sensibly and simply, there was something
  uncanny; it was like a dead man talking at the table.</p>

  <p>As Byrne went out with his message of defiance, and passed along the very
  narrow passage beside the grocery store, he found the end of it blocked by a
  strange though strangely familiar figure: short and sturdy, and looking
  rather quaint when seen in dark outline with its round head and wide hat.</p>

  <p>'Father Brown!' cried the astonished journalist. 'I think you must have
  come into the wrong door. You're not likely to be in this little
  conspiracy.'</p>

  <p>'Mine is a rather older conspiracy,' replied Father Brown smiling,' but it
  is quite a widespread conspiracy.'</p>

  <p>'Well,' replied Byrne,' you can't imagine any of the people here being
  within a thousand miles of your concern.'</p>

  <p>'It is not always easy to tell,' replied the priest equably; 'but as a
  matter of fact, there is one person here who's within an inch of it.'</p>

  <p>He disappeared into the dark entrance and the journalist went on his way
  very much puzzled. He was still more puzzled by a small incident that
  happened to him as he turned into the hotel to make his report to his
  capitalist clients. The bower of blossoms and bird-cages in which those
  crabbed old gentlemen were embosomed was approached by a flight of marble
  steps, flanked by gilded nymphs and tritons. Down these steps ran an active
  young man with black hair, a snub nose, and a flower in his buttonhole, who
  seized him and drew him aside before he could ascend the stair.</p>

  <p>'I say,' whispered the young man, 'I'm Potter&mdash;old Gid's secretary,
  you know: now, between ourselves, there is a sort of a thunderbolt being
  forged, isn't there, now?'</p>

  <p>'I came to the conclusion,' replied Byrne cautiously, 'that the Cyclops
  had something on the anvil. But always remember that the Cyclops is a giant,
  but he has only one eye. I think Bolshevism is&mdash;'</p>

  <p>While he was speaking the secretary listened with a face that had a
  certain almost Mongolian immobility, despite the liveliness of his legs and
  his attire. But when Byrne said the word 'Bolshevism', the young man's sharp
  eyes shifted and he said quickly:</p>

  <p>'What has that&mdash;oh yes, that sort of thunderbolt; so sorry, my
  mistake. So easy to say anvil when you mean ice-box.'</p>

  <p>With which the extraordinary young man disappeared down the steps and
  Byrne continued to mount them, more and more mystification clouding his
  mind.</p>

  <p>He found the group of three augmented to four by the presence of a
  hatchet-faced person with very thin straw-coloured hair and a monocle, who
  appeared to be a sort of adviser to old Gallup, possibly his solicitor,
  though he was not definitely so called. His name was Nares, and the questions
  which he directed towards Byrne referred chiefly, for some reason or other,
  to the number of those probably enrolled in the revolutionary organization.
  Of this, as Byrne knew little, he said less; and the four men eventually rose
  from their seats, the last word being with the man who had been most
  silent.</p>

  <p>'Thank you, Mr Byrne,' said Stein, folding up his eyeglasses. 'It only
  remains to say that everything is ready; on that point I quite agree with Mr
  Elias. Tomorrow, before noon, the police will have arrested Mr Elias, on
  evidence I shall by then have put before them, and those three at least will
  be in jail before night. As you know, I attempted to avoid this course. I
  think that is all, gentlemen.'</p>

  <p>But Mr Jacob P. Stein did not lay his formal information next day, for a
  reason that has often interrupted the activities of such industrious
  characters. He did not do it because he happened to be dead; and none of the
  rest of the programme was carried out, for a reason which Byrne found
  displayed in gigantic letters when he opened his morning paper: 'Terrific
  Triple Murder: Three Millionaires Slain in One Night.' Other exclamatory
  phrases followed in smaller letters, only about four times the size of normal
  type, which insisted on the special feature of the mystery: the fact that the
  three men had been killed not only simultaneously but in three widely
  separated places&mdash;Stein in his artistic and luxurious country seat a
  hundred miles inland, Wise outside the little bungalow on the coast where he
  lived on sea breezes and the simple life, and old Gallup in a thicket just
  outside the lodge-gates of his great house at the other end of the county. In
  all three cases there could be no doubt about the scenes of violence that had
  preceded death, though the actual body of Gallup was not found till the
  second day, where it hung, huge and horrible, amid the broken forks and
  branches of the little wood into which its weight had crashed, like a bison
  rushing on the spears: while Wise had clearly been flung over the cliff into
  the sea, not without a struggle, for his scraping and slipping footprints
  could still be traced upon the very brink. But the first signal of the
  tragedy had been the sight of his large limp straw hat, floating far out upon
  the waves and conspicuous from the cliffs above. Stein's body also had at
  first eluded search, till a faint trail of blood led the investigators to a
  bath on the ancient Roman model he had been constructing in his garden; for
  he had been a man of an experimental turn of mind with a taste for
  antiquities.</p>

  <p>Whatever he might think, Byrne was bound to admit that there was no legal
  evidence against anybody as things stood. A motive for murder was not enough.
  Even a moral aptitude for murder was not enough. And he could not conceive
  that pale young pacifist, Henry Home, butchering another man by brutal
  violence, though he might imagine the blaspheming Jake and even the sneering
  Jew as capable of anything. The police, and the man who appeared to be
  assisting them (who was no other than the rather mysterious man with the
  monocle, who had been introduced as Mr Nares), realized the position quite as
  clearly as the journalist.</p>

  <p>They knew that at the moment the Bolshevist conspirators could not be
  prosecuted and convicted, and that it would be a highly sensational failure
  if they were prosecuted and acquitted. Nares started with an artful candour
  by calling them in some sense to the council, inviting them to a private
  conclave and asking them to give their opinions freely in the interests of
  humanity. He had started his investigations at the nearest scene of tragedy,
  the bungalow by the sea; and Byrne was permitted to be present at a curious
  scene, which was at once a peaceful parley of diplomatists and a veiled
  inquisition or putting of suspects to the question. Rather to Byrne's
  surprise the incongruous company, seated round the table in the seaside
  bungalow, included the dumpy figure and owlish head of Father Brown, though
  his connexion with the affair did not appear until some time afterwards. The
  presence of young Potter, the dead man's secretary, was more natural; yet
  somehow his demeanour was not quite so natural. He alone was quite familiar
  with their meeting-place, and was even in some grim sense their host; yet he
  offered little assistance or information. His round snub-nosed face wore an
  expression more like sulks than sorrow.</p>

  <p>Jake Halket as usual talked most; and a man of his type could not be
  expected to keep up the polite fiction that he and his friends were not
  accused. Young Home, in his more refined way, tried to restrain him when he
  began to abuse the men who had been murdered; but Jake was always quite as
  ready to roar down his friends as his foes. In a spout of blasphemies he
  relieved his soul of a very unofficial obituary notice of the late Gideon
  Wise. Elias sat quite still and apparently indifferent behind those
  spectacles that masked his eyes.</p>

  <p>'It would be useless, I suppose,' said Nares coldly, 'to tell you that
  your remarks are indecent. It may affect you more if I tell you they are
  imprudent. You practically admit that you hated the dead man.'</p>

  <p>'Going to put me in quod for that, are you?' jeered the demagogue. 'All
  right. Only you'll have to build a prison for a million men if you're going
  to jail all the poor people who had reason to hate Gid Wise. And you know
  it's God truth as well as I do.'</p>

  <p>Nares was silent; and nobody spoke until Elias interposed with his clear
  though faintly lisping drawl.</p>

  <p>'This appears to me to be a highly unprofitable discussion on both sides,'
  he said. 'You have summoned us here either to ask us for information or to
  subject us to cross-examination. If you trust us, we tell you we have no
  information. If you distrust us, you must tell us of what we are accused, or
  have the politeness to keep the fact to yourselves. Nobody has been able to
  suggest the faintest trace of evidence connecting any one of us with these
  tragedies any more than with the murder of Julius Caesar. You dare not arrest
  us, and you will not believe us. What is the good of our remaining here?'</p>

  <p>And he rose, calmly buttoning his coat, his friends following his example.
  As they went towards the door, young Home turned back and faced the
  investigators for a moment with his pale fanatical face.</p>

  <p>'I wish to say,' he said, 'that I went to a filthy jail during the whole
  war because I would not consent to kill a man.'</p>

  <p>With that they passed out, and the members of the group remaining looked
  grimly at each other.</p>

  <p>'I hardly think,' said Father Brown, 'that we remain entirely victorious,
  in spite of the retreat.'</p>

  <p>'I don't mind anything,' said Nares, 'except being bullyragged by that
  blasphemous blackguard Halket. Home is a gentleman, anyhow. But whatever they
  say, I am dead certain they know; they are in it, or most of them are. They
  almost admitted it. They taunted us with not being able to prove we're right,
  much more than with being wrong. What do you think, Father Brown?'</p>

  <p>The person addressed looked across at Nares with a gaze almost
  disconcertingly mild and meditative.</p>

  <p>'It is quite true,' he said, 'that I have formed an idea that one
  particular person knows more than he has told us. But I think it would be
  well if I did not mention his name just yet.'</p>

  <p>Nares' eyeglass dropped from his eye, and he looked up sharply. 'This is
  unofficial so far,' he said. 'I suppose you know that at a later stage if you
  withhold information, your position may be serious.'</p>

  <p>'My position is simple,' replied the priest. 'I am here to look after the
  legitimate interests of my friend Halket. I think it will be in his interest,
  under the circumstances, if I tell you I think he will before long sever his
  connexion with this organization, and cease to be a Socialist in that sense.
  I have every reason to believe he will probably end as a Catholic.'</p>

  <p>'Halket!' exploded the other incredulously. 'Why he curses priests from
  morning till night!'</p>

  <p>'I don't think you quite understand that kind of man,' said Father Brown
  mildly. 'He curses priests for failing (in his opinion) to defy the whole
  world for justice. Why should he expect them to defy the whole world for
  justice, unless he had already begun to assume they were&mdash; what they
  are? But we haven't met here to discuss the psychology of conversion. I only
  mention this because it may simplify your task&mdash; perhaps narrow your
  search.'</p>

  <p>'If it is true, it would jolly well narrow it to that narrow-faced rascal
  Elias&mdash;and I shouldn't wonder, for a more creepy, coldblooded, sneering
  devil I never saw.'</p>

  <p>Father Brown sighed. 'He always reminded me of poor Stein,' he said, 'in
  fact I think he was some relation.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, I say,' began Nares, when his protest was cut short by the door being
  flung open, revealing once more the long loose figure and pale face of young
  Home; but it seemed as if he had not merely his natural, but a new and
  unnatural pallor.</p>

  <p>'Hullo,' cried Nares, putting up his single eyeglass, 'why have you come
  back again?'</p>

  <p>Home crossed the room rather shakily without a word and sat down heavily
  in a chair. Then he said, as in a sort of daze: 'I missed the others ... I
  lost my way. I thought I'd better come back.'</p>

  <p>The remains of evening refreshments were on the table, and Henry Home,
  that lifelong Prohibitionist, poured himself out a wine-glassful of liqueur
  brandy and drank it at a gulp. 'You seem upset,' said Father Brown.</p>

  <p>Home had put his hands to his forehead and spoke as from under the shadow
  of it: he seemed to be speaking to the priest only, in a low voice.</p>

  <p>'I may as well tell you. I have seen a ghost.'</p>

  <p>'A ghost!' repeated Nares in astonishment. 'Whose ghost?'</p>

  <p>'The ghost of Gideon Wise, the master of this house,' answered Home more
  firmly, 'standing over the abyss into which he fell.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, nonsense!' said Nares; 'no sensible person believes in ghosts.'</p>

  <p>'That is hardly exact,' said Father Brown, smiling a little. 'There is
  really quite as good evidence for many ghosts as there is for most
  crimes.'</p>

  <p>'Well, it's my business to run after the criminals,' said Nares rather
  roughly, 'and I will leave other people to run away from the ghosts. If
  anybody at this time of day chooses to be frightened of ghosts it's his
  affair.'</p>

  <p>'I didn't say I was frightened of them, though I dare say I might be,'
  said Father Brown. 'Nobody knows till he tries. I said I believed in them, at
  any rate, enough to want to hear more about this one. What, exactly, did you
  see, Mr Home?'</p>

  <p>'It was over there on the brink of those crumbling cliffs; you know there
  is a sort of gap or crevice just about the spot where he was thrown over. The
  others had gone on ahead, and I was crossing the moor towards the path along
  the cliff. I often went that way, for I liked seeing the high seas dash up
  against the crags. I thought little of it to-night, beyond wondering that the
  sea should be so rough on this sort of clear moonlight night. I could see the
  pale crests of spray appear and disappear as the great waves leapt up at the
  headland. Thrice I saw the momentary flash of foam in the moonlight and then
  I saw something inscrutable. The fourth flash of the silver foam seemed to be
  fixed in the sky. It did not fall; I waited with insane intensity for it to
  fall. I fancied I was mad, and that time had been for me mysteriously
  arrested or prolonged. Then I drew nearer, and then I think I screamed aloud.
  For that suspended spray, like unfallen snowflakes, had fitted together into
  a face and a figure, white as the shining leper in a legend, and terrible as
  the fixed lightning.'</p>

  <p>'And it was Gideon Wise, you say?'</p>

  <p>Home nodded without speech. There was a silence broken abruptly by Nares
  rising to his feet; so abruptly indeed that he knocked a chair over.</p>

  <p>'Oh, this is all nonsense,' he said, 'but we'd better go out and see.'</p>

  <p>'I won't go,' said Home with sudden violence. 'I'll never walk by that
  path again.'</p>

  <p>'I think we must all walk by that path tonight,' said the priest gravely;
  'though I will never deny it has been a perilous path ... to more people than
  one.'</p>

  <p>'I will not... God, how you all goad me,' cried Home, and his eyes began
  to roll in a strange fashion. He had risen with the rest, hut he made no
  motion towards the door.</p>

  <p>'Mr Home,' said Nares firmly, 'I am a police-officer, and this house,
  though you may not know it, is surrounded by the police. I have tried to
  investigate in a friendly fashion, but I must investigate everything, even
  anything so silly as a ghost. I must ask you to take me to the spot you speak
  of.'</p>

  <p>There was another silence while Home stood heaving and panting as with
  indescribable fears. Then he suddenly sat down on his chair again and said
  with an entirely new and much more composed voice:</p>

  <p>'I can't do it. You may just as well know why. You will know it sooner or
  later. I killed him.'</p>

  <p>For an instant there was the stillness of a house struck by a thunderbolt
  and full of corpses. Then the voice of Father Brown sounded in that enormous
  silence strangely small like the squeak of a mouse.</p>

  <p>'Did you kill him deliberately?' he asked.</p>

  <p>'How can one answer such a question?' answered the man in the chair,
  moodily gnawing his finger. 'I was mad, I suppose. He was intolerable and
  insolent, I know. I was on his land and I believe he struck me; anyhow, we
  came to a grapple and he went over the cliff. When I was well away from the
  scene it burst upon me that I had done a crime that cut me off from men; the
  brand of Cain throbbed on my brow and my very brain; I realized for the first
  time that I had indeed killed a man. I knew I should have to confess it
  sooner or later.' He sat suddenly erect in his chair. 'But I will say nothing
  against anybody else. It is no use asking me about plots or
  accomplices&mdash;I will say nothing.'</p>

  <p>'In the light of the other murders,' said Nares, 'it is difficult to
  believe that the quarrel was quite so unpremeditated. Surely somebody sent
  you there?'</p>

  <p>'I will say nothing against anybody I worked with,' said Home proudly. 'I
  am a murderer, but I will not be a traitor.'</p>

  <p>Nares stepped between the man and the door and called out in an official
  fashion to someone outside.</p>

  <p>'We will all go to the place, anyhow,' he said in a low voice to the
  secretary; 'but this man must go in custody.'</p>

  <p>The company generally felt that to go spook-hunting on a seacliff was a
  very silly anti-climax after the confession of the murderer. But Nares,
  though the most sceptical and scornful of all, thought it his duty to leave
  no stone unturned; as one might say, no gravestone unturned. For, after all,
  that crumbling cliff was the only gravestone over the watery grave of poor
  Gideon Wise. Nares locked the door, being the last out of the house, and
  followed the rest across the moor to the cliff, when he was astonished to see
  young Potter, the secretary, coming back quickly towards them, his face in
  the moonlight looking white as a moon.</p>

  <p>'By God, sir,' he said, speaking for the first time that night, 'there
  really is something there. It&mdash;it's just like him.'</p>

  <p>'Why, you're raving,' gasped the detective. 'Everybody's raving.'</p>

  <p>'Do you think I don't know him when I see him?' cried the secretary with
  singular bitterness. 'I have reason to.'</p>

  <p>'Perhaps,' said the detective sharply, 'you are one of those who had
  reason to hate him, as Halket said.'</p>

  <p>'Perhaps,' said the secretary; 'anyhow, I know him, and I tell you I can
  see him standing there stark and staring under this hellish moon.'</p>

  <p>And he pointed towards the crack in the cliffs, where they could already
  see something that might have been a moonbeam or a streak of foam, but which
  was already beginning to look a little more solid. They had crept a hundred
  yards nearer, and it was still motionless; but it looked like a statue in
  silver.</p>

  <p>Nares himself looked a little pale and seemed to stand debating what to
  do. Potter was frankly as much frightened as Home himself; and even Byrne,
  who was a hardened reporter, was rather reluctant to go any nearer if he
  could help it. He could not help considering it a little quaint, therefore,
  that the only man who did not seem to be frightened of a ghost was the man
  who had said openly that he might be. For Father Brown was advancing as
  steadily, at his stumping pace, as if he were going to consult a
  notice-board.</p>

  <p>'It don't seem to bother you much,' said Byrne to the priest; 'and yet I
  thought you were the only one who believed in spooks.'</p>

  <p>'If it comes to that,' replied Father Brown, 'I thought you were one who
  didn't believe in them. But believing in ghosts is one thing, and believing
  in a ghost is quite another.'</p>

  <p>Byrne looked rather ashamed of himself, and glanced almost covertly at the
  crumbling headlands in the cold moonlight which were the haunts of the vision
  or delusion. 'I didn't believe in it till I saw it,' he said.</p>

  <p>'And I did believe in it till I saw it,' said Father Brown. The journalist
  stared after him as he went stumping across the great waste ground that rose
  towards the cloven headland like the sloping side of a hill cut in two. Under
  the discolouring moon the grass looked like long grey hair all combed one way
  by the wind, and seeming to point towards the place where the breaking cliff
  showed pale gleams of chalk in the grey-green turf, and where stood the pale
  figure or shining shade that none could yet understand. As yet that pale
  figure dominated a desolate landscape that was empty except for the black
  square back and business-like figure of the priest advancing alone towards
  it. Then the prisoner Home broke suddenly from his captors with a piercing
  cry and ran ahead of the priest, falling on his knees before the spectre.</p>

  <p>'I have confessed,' they heard him crying. 'Why have you come to tell them
  I killed you?'</p>

  <p>'I have come to tell them you did not,' said the ghost, and stretched
  forth a hand to him. Then the kneeling man sprang up with quite a new kind of
  scream; and they knew it was the hand of flesh.</p>

  <p>It was the most remarkable escape from death in recent records, said the
  experienced detective and the no less experienced journalist. Yet, in a
  sense, it had been very simple after all. Flakes and shards of the cliff were
  continually falling away, and some had caught in the gigantic crevice, so as
  to form what was really a ledge or pocket in what was supposed to be a sheer
  drop through darkness to the sea. The old man, who was a very tough and wiry
  old man, had fallen on this lower shoulder of rock and had passed a pretty
  terrible twenty-four hours in trying to climb back by crags that constantly
  collapsed under him, but at length formed by their very ruins a sort of
  stairway of escape. This might be the explanation of Home's optical illusion
  about a white wave that appeared and disappeared, and finally came to stay.
  But anyhow there was Gideon Wise, solid in bone and sinew, with his white
  hair and white dusty country clothes and harsh country features, which were,
  however, a great deal less harsh than usual. Perhaps it is good for
  millionaires to spend twenty-four hours on a ledge of rock within a foot of
  eternity. Anyhow, he not only disclaimed all malice against the criminal, but
  gave an account of the matter which considerably modified the crime. He
  declared that Home had not thrown him over at all; that the continually
  breaking ground had given way under him, and that Home had even made some
  movement as of attempted rescue.</p>

  <p>'On that providential bit of rock down there,' he said solemnly, 'I
  promised the Lord to forgive my enemies; and the Lord would think it mighty
  mean if I didn't forgive a little accident like that.'</p>

  <p>Home had to depart under police supervision, of course, but the detective
  did not disguise from himself that the prisoner's detention would probably be
  short, and his punishment, if any, trifling. It is not every murderer who can
  put the murdered man in the witness-box to give him a testimonial.</p>

  <p>'It's a strange case,' said Byrne, as the detective and the others
  hastened along the cliff path towards the town.</p>

  <p>'It is,' said Father Brown. 'It's no business of ours; but I wish you'd
  stop with me and talk it over.'</p>

  <p>There was a silence and then Byrne complied by saying suddenly: 'I suppose
  you were thinking of Home already, when you said somebody wasn't telling all
  he knew.'</p>

  <p>'When I said that,' replied his friend, 'I was thinking of the exceedingly
  silent Mr Potter, the secretary of the no longer late or (shall we say)
  lamented Mr Gideon Wise.'</p>

  <p>'Well, the only time Potter ever spoke to me I thought he was a lunatic,'
  said Byrne, staring, 'but I never thought of his being a criminal. He said
  something about it all having to do with an icebox.'</p>

  <p>'Yes, I thought he knew something about it,' said Father Brown
  reflectively. 'I never said he had anything to do with it ... I suppose old
  Wise really is strong enough to have climbed out of that chasm.'</p>

  <p>'What do you mean?' asked the astonished reporter. 'Why, of course he got
  out of that chasm; for there he is.'</p>

  <p>The priest did not answer the question but asked abruptly: 'What do you
  think of Home?'</p>

  <p>'Well, one can't call him a criminal exactly,' answered Byrne. 'He never
  was at all like any criminal I ever knew, and I've had some experience; and,
  of course, Nares has had much more. I don't think we ever quite believed him
  a criminal.'</p>

  <p>'And I never believed in him in another capacity,' said the priest
  quietly. 'You may know more about criminals. But there's one class of people
  I probably do know more about than you do, or even Nares for that matter.
  I've known quite a lot of them, and I know their little ways.'</p>

  <p>'Another class of people,' repeated Byrne, mystified.' Why, what class do
  you know about?'</p>

  <p>'Penitents,' said Father Brown.</p>

  <p>'I don't quite understand,' objected Byrne. 'Do you mean you don't believe
  in his crime?'</p>

  <p>'I don't believe in his confession,' said Father Brown. 'I've heard a good
  many confessions, and there was never a genuine one like that. It was
  romantic; it was all out of books. Look how he talked about having the brand
  of Cain. That's out of books. It's not what anyone would feel who had in his
  own person done a thing hitherto horrible to him. Suppose you were an honest
  clerk or shop-boy shocked to feel that for the first time you'd stolen money.
  Would you immediately reflect that your action was the same as that of
  Barabbas? Suppose you'd killed a child in some ghastly anger. Would you go
  back through history, till you could identify your action with that of an
  Idumean potentate named Herod? Believe me, our own crimes are far too
  hideously private and prosaic to make our first thoughts turn towards
  historical parallels, however apt. And why did he go out of his way to say he
  would not give his colleagues away? Even in saying so, he was giving them
  away. Nobody had asked him so far to give away anything or anybody. No; I
  don't think he was genuine, and I wouldn't give him absolution. A nice state
  of things, if people started getting absolved for what they hadn't done.' And
  Father Brown, his head turned away, looked steadily out to sea.</p>

  <p>'But I don't understand what you're driving at,' cried Byrne. 'What's the
  good of buzzing round him with suspicions when he's pardoned? He's out of it
  anyhow. He's quite safe.'</p>

  <p>Father Brown spun round like a teetotum and caught his friend by the coat
  with unexpected and inexplicable excitement.</p>

  <p>'That's it,' he cried emphatically.' Freeze on to that! He's quite safe.
  He's out of it. That's why he's the key of the whole puzzle.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, help,' said Byrne feebly.</p>

  <p>'I mean,' persisted the little priest, 'he's in it because he's out of it.
  That's the whole explanation.'</p>

  <p>'And a very lucid explanation too,' said the journalist with feeling.</p>

  <p>They stood looking out to sea for a time in silence, and then Father Brown
  said cheerfully: 'And so we come back to the ice-box. Where you have all gone
  wrong from the first in this business is where a good many of the papers and
  the public men do go wrong. It's because you assumed that there is nothing
  whatever in the modern world to fight about except Bolshevism. This story has
  nothing whatever to do with Bolshevism; except perhaps as a blind.'</p>

  <p>'I don't see how that can be,' remonstrated Byrne. 'Here you have the
  three millionaires in that one business murdered&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'No!' said the priest in a sharp ringing voice. 'You do not. That is just
  the point. You do not have three millionaires murdered. You have two
  millionaires murdered; and you have the third millionaire very much alive and
  kicking and quite ready to kick. And you have that third millionaire freed
  for ever from the threat that was thrown at his head before your very face,
  in playfully polite terms, and in that conversation you described as taking
  place in the hotel. Gallup and Stein threatened the more old-fashioned and
  independent old huckster that if he would not come into their combine they
  would freeze him out. Hence the ice-box, of course.'</p>

  <p>After a pause he went on. 'There is undoubtedly a Bolshevist movement in
  the modern world, and it must undoubtedly be resisted, though I do not
  believe very much in your way of resisting it. But what nobody notices is
  that there is another movement equally modern and equally moving: the great
  movement towards monopoly or the turning of all trades into trusts. That also
  is a revolution. That also produces what all revolutions produce. Men will
  kill for that and against that, as they do for and against Bolshevism. It has
  its ultimatums and its invasions and its executions. These trust magnates
  have their courts like kings; they have their bodyguard and bravos; they have
  their spies in the enemy camp. Home was one of old Gideon's spies in one of
  the enemy camps; but he was used here against another enemy: the rivals who
  were ruining him for standing out.'</p>

  <p>'I still don't quite see how he was used,' said Byrne, 'or what was the
  good of it.'</p>

  <p>'Don't you see,' cried Father Brown sharply, 'that they gave each other an
  alibi?'</p>

  <p>Byrne still looked at him a little doubtfully, though understanding was
  dawning on his face.</p>

  <p>'That's what I mean,' continued the other, 'when I say they were in it
  because they were out of it. Most people would say they must be out of the
  other two crimes, because they were in this one. As a fact, they were in the
  other two because they were out of this one; because this one never happened
  at all. A very queer, improbable sort of alibi, of course; improbable and
  therefore impenetrable. Most people would say a man who confesses a murder
  must be sincere; a man who forgives his murderer must be sincere. Nobody
  would think of the notion that the thing never happened, so that one man had
  nothing to forgive and the other nothing to fear. They were fixed here for
  that night by a story against themselves. But they were not here that night;
  for Home was murdering old Gallup in the Wood, while Wise was strangling that
  little Jew in his Roman bath. That's why I ask whether Wise was really strong
  enough for the climbing adventure.'</p>

  <p>'It was quite a good adventure,' said Byrne regretfully. 'It fitted into
  the landscape, and was really very convincing.'</p>

  <p>'Too convincing to convince,' said Father Brown, shaking his head. 'How
  very vivid was that moonlit foam flung up and turning to a ghost. And how
  very literary! Home is a sneak and a skunk, but do not forget that, like many
  other sneaks and skunks in history, he is also a poet.'</p>
