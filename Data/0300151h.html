<h2><a name="c01" id="c01"><i>Writing Herself Out</i></a>
</h2>

<p>Emily Byrd Starr was alone in her room, in the old New Moon
farmhouse at Blair Water, one stormy night in a February of the
olden years before the world turned upside down. She was at that
moment as perfectly happy as any human being is ever permitted to
be. Aunt Elizabeth, in consideration of the coldness of the night,
had allowed her to have a fire in her little fireplace&mdash;a rare
favour. It was burning brightly and showering a red-golden light
over the small, immaculate room, with its old-time furniture and
deep-set, wide-silled windows, to whose frosted, blue-white panes
the snowflakes clung in little wreaths. It lent depth and mystery
to the mirror on the wall which reflected Emily as she sat coiled
on the ottoman before the fire, writing, by the light of two tall,
white candles&mdash;which were the only approved means of
illumination at New Moon&mdash;in a brand-new, glossy, black
"Jimmy-book" which Cousin Jimmy had given her that day. Emily had
been very glad to get it, for she had filled the one he had given
her the preceding autumn, and for over a week she had suffered
acute pangs of suppression because she could not write in a
nonexistent "diary."</p>

<p>Her diary had become a dominant factor in her young, vivid life.
It had taken the place of certain "letters" she had written in her
childhood to her dead father, in which she had been wont to "write
out" her problems and worries&mdash;for even in the magic years
when one is almost fourteen one has problems and worries,
especially when one is under the strict and well-meant but not
over-tender governance of an Aunt Elizabeth Murray. Sometimes Emily
felt that if it were not for her diary she would have flown into
little bits by reason of consuming her own smoke. The fat, black
"Jimmy-book" seemed to her like a personal friend and a safe
confidant for certain matters which burned for expression and yet
were too combustible to be trusted to the ears of any living being.
Now blank books of any sort were not easy to come by at New Moon,
and if it had not been for Cousin Jimmy, Emily might never have had
one. Certainly Aunt Elizabeth would not give her one&mdash;Aunt
Elizabeth thought Emily wasted far too much time "over her
scribbling nonsense" as it was&mdash;and Aunt Laura did not dare to
go contrary to Aunt Elizabeth in this&mdash;more by token that
Laura herself really thought Emily might be better employed. Aunt
Laura was a jewel of a woman, but certain things were holden from
her eyes.</p>

<p>Now Cousin Jimmy was never in the least frightened of Aunt
Elizabeth, and when the notion occurred to him that Emily probably
wanted another "blank book," that blank book materialized
straightway, in defiance of Aunt Elizabeth's scornful glances. He
had gone to Shrewsbury that very day, in the teeth of the rising
storm, for no other reason than to get it. So Emily was happy, in
her subtle and friendly firelight, while the wind howled and
shrieked through the great old trees to the north of New Moon, sent
huge, spectral wreaths of snow whirling across Cousin Jimmy's
famous garden, drifted the sundial completely over, and whistled
eerily through the Three Princesses&mdash;as Emily always called
the three tall Lombardies in the corner of the garden.</p>

<p>"I love a storm like this at night when I don't have to go out
in it," wrote Emily. "Cousin Jimmy and I had a splendid evening
planning out our garden and choosing our seeds and plants in the
catalogue. Just where the biggest drift is making, behind the
summer-house, we are going to have a bed of pink asters, and we are
going to give the Golden Ones&mdash;who are dreaming under four
feet of snow&mdash;a background of flowering almond. I love to plan
out summer days like this, in the midst of a storm. It makes me
feel as if I were winning a victory over something ever so much
bigger than myself, just because <i>I</i> have a brain and the
storm is nothing but blind, white force&mdash;terrible, but blind.
I have the same feeling when I sit here cosily by my own dear fire,
and hear it raging all around me, and <i>laugh</i> at it. And
<i>that</i> is just because over a hundred years ago
great-great-grandfather Murray built this house and built it well.
I wonder if, a hundred years from now, anybody will win a victory
over anything because of something <i>I</i> left or did. It is an
<i>inspiring thought.</i></p>

<p>"I drew that line of italics before I thought. Mr. Carpenter
says I use far too many italics. He says it is an Early Victorian
obsession, and I must strive to cast it off. I concluded I would
when I looked in the dictionary, for it is evidently not a nice
thing to be obsessed, though it doesn't seem quite so bad as to be
<i>possessed.</i> There I go again: but I think the italics are all
right this time.</p>

<p>"I read the dictionary for a whole hour&mdash;till Aunt
Elizabeth got suspicious and suggested that it would be much better
for me to be knitting my ribbed stockings. She couldn't see exactly
why it was wrong for me to be poring over the dictionary but she
felt sure it must be because <i>she</i> never wants to do it. I
<i>love</i> reading the dictionary. (Yes, those italics are
<i>necessary,</i> Mr. Carpenter. An ordinary 'love' wouldn't
express my feeling at all!) Words are such <i>fas</i>cinating
things. (I caught myself at the first syllable that time!) The very
sound of some of them&mdash;'haunted'&mdash;'mystic'&mdash;for
example, gives me <i>the flash.</i> (Oh, dear! But I <i>have</i> to
italicize <i>the flash. It</i> isn't ordinary&mdash;it's the most
extraordinary and wonderful thing in my whole life. When it comes I
feel as if a door had swung open in a wall before me and given me a
glimpse of&mdash;yes, of <i>heaven. More italics!</i> Oh, I see why
Mr, Carpenter scolds! I <i>must</i> break myself of the habit.)</p>

<p>"Big words are never
beautiful&mdash;'incriminating'&mdash;'obstreperous'&mdash;'international'&mdash;'unconstitutional.'
They make me think of those horrible big dahlias and chrysanthemums
Cousin Jimmy took me to see at the exhibition in Charlottetown last
fall. We couldn't see anything lovely in them, though some people
thought them wonderful. Cousin Jimmy's little yellow 'mums, like
pale, fairy-like stars shining against the fir copse in the
north-west corner of the garden, were ten times more beautiful. But
I am wandering from my subject&mdash;also a bad habit of mine,
according to Mr. Carpenter. He says I <i>must</i> (the italics are
his this time!) learn to concentrate&mdash;another big word and a
very ugly one.</p>

<p>"But I had a good time over that dictionary&mdash;much better
than I had over the ribbed stockings. I wish I could have a
pair&mdash;just one pair&mdash;of silk stockings. Ilse has three.
Her father gives her everything she wants, now that he has learned
to love her. But Aunt Elizabeth says silk stockings are
<i>immoral</i>. I wonder why&mdash;any more than silk dresses.</p>

<p>"Speaking of silk dresses, Aunt Janey Milburn, at Derry
Pond&mdash;she isn't any relation really, but everybody calls her
that&mdash;has made a vow that she will never wear a silk dress
until the whole heathen world is converted to Christianity. That is
very fine. I wish <i>I</i> could be as good as that, but I
couldn't&mdash;I love silk too much. It is so rich and sheeny. I
would like to dress in it all the time, and if I could afford to I
would&mdash;though I suppose every time I thought of dear old Aunt
Janey and the unconverted heathen I would feel conscience-stricken.
However, it will be years, if ever, before I can afford to buy even
one silk dress, and meanwhile I give some of my egg money every
month to missions. (I have five hens of my own now, all descended
from the gray pullet Perry gave me on my twelfth birthday.) If ever
I can buy that one silk dress I know what it is going to be like.
Not black or brown or navy blue&mdash;sensible, serviceable
colours, such as New Moon Murrays always wear&mdash;oh, dear, no!
It is to be of shot silk, blue in one light, silver in others, like
a twilight sky, glimpsed through a frosted window-pane&mdash;with a
bit of lace-foam here and there, like those little feathers of snow
clinging to my window-pane. Teddy says he will paint me in it and
call it 'The Ice Maiden,' and Aunt Laura smiles and says, sweetly
and condescendingly, in a way I hate even in dear Aunt Laura,</p>

<p>"'What use would such a dress be to you, Emily?'</p>

<p>"It mightn't be of any use, but I would feel in it as if it were
a part of me&mdash;that it <i>grew</i> on me and wasn't just bought
and put on. I want <i>one</i> dress like that in my life-time. And
a silk petticoat underneath it&mdash;and silk stockings!</p>

<p>"Ilse has a silk dress now&mdash;a bright pink one. Aunt
Elizabeth says Dr. Burnley dresses Ilse far too old and rich for a
child. But he wants to make up for all the years he didn't dress
her at all. (I don't mean she went naked, but she might have as far
as Dr. Burnley was concerned. Other people had to see to her
clothes.) He does everything she wants him to do now, and gives her
her own way in everything. Aunt Elizabeth says it is very bad for
her, but there are times when I envy Ilse a little. I know it is
wicked, but I cannot help it.</p>

<p>"Dr. Burnley is going to send Ilse to Shrewsbury High School
next fall, and after that to Montreal to study elocution. That is
why I envy her&mdash;not because of the silk dress. I wish Aunt
Elizabeth would let me go to Shrewsbury, but I fear she never will.
She feels she can't trust me out of her sight because my mother
eloped. But she need not be afraid I will ever elope. I have made
up my mind that I will never marry. I shall be <i>wedded to my
art.</i></p>

<p>"Teddy wants to go to Shrewsbury next fall, but his mother won't
let him go, either. Not that she is afraid of his eloping, but
because she loves him so much she can't part with him. Teddy wants
to be an artist, and Mr. Carpenter says he has genius and should
have his chance, but everybody is afraid to say anything to Mrs.
Kent. She is a little bit of a woman&mdash;no taller than I am,
really, quiet and shy&mdash;and yet every one is afraid of her.
<i>I</i> am&mdash;dreadfully afraid. I've always known she didn't
like me&mdash;ever since those days long ago when Ilse and I first
went up to the Tansy Patch, to play with Teddy. But now she hates
me&mdash;I feel sure of it&mdash;just because Teddy likes me. She
can't bear to have him like anybody or anything but her. She is
even jealous of his pictures. So there is not much chance of his
getting to Shrewsbury. Perry is going. He hasn't a cent, but he is
going to work his way through. That is why he thinks he will go to
Shrewsbury in place of Queen's Academy. He thinks it will be easier
to get work to do in Shrewsbury, and board is cheaper there.</p>

<p>"'My old beast of an Aunt Tom has a little money,' he told me,
'but she won't give me any of
it&mdash;unless&mdash;unless&mdash;'</p>

<p>"Then he looked at me <i>significantly.</i></p>

<p>"I blushed because I couldn't help it, and then I was furious
with myself for blushing, and with Perry&mdash;because he referred
to something I didn't want to hear about&mdash;that time ever so
long ago when his Aunt Tom met me in Lofty John's bush and nearly
frightened me to death by demanding that I promise to <i>marry
Perry when we grew up,</i> in which case she would educate him. I
never told anybody about it&mdash;being ashamed&mdash;except Ilse,
and she said,</p>

<p>"'The idea of old Aunt Tom aspiring to a Murray for Perry!'</p>

<p>"But then, Ilse is awfully hard on Perry and quarrels with him
half the time, over things <i>I</i> only smile at. Perry never
likes to be outdone by anyone in anything. When we were at Amy
Moore's party last week, her uncle told us a story of some
remarkable freak calf he had seen, with three legs, and Perry
said,</p>

<p>"'Oh, <i>that's</i> nothing to a duck I saw once in Norway.'</p>

<p>"(Perry really was in Norway. He used to sail everywhere with
his father when he was little. But I don't believe one word about
that duck. He wasn't <i>lying</i>&mdash;he was just
<i>romancing.</i> Dear Mr. Carpenter, I <i>can't</i> get along
without italics.)</p>

<p>"Perry's duck had four legs, according to him&mdash;two where a
proper duck's legs should be, and two sprouting from its back. And
when it got tired of walking on its ordinary pair it flopped over
on its back and walked on the other pair!</p>

<p>"Perry told this yarn with a sober face, and everybody laughed,
and Amy's uncle said, 'Go up head, Perry.' But Ilse was furious and
wouldn't speak to him all the way home. She said he had made a fool
of himself, trying to 'show off' with a silly story like that, and
that <i>no gentleman</i> would act so.</p>

<p>"Perry said: 'I'm no gentleman, yet, only a hired boy, but some
day, Miss Ilse, I'll be a finer gentleman than anyone <i>you</i>
know.'</p>

<p>"'Gentlemen,' said Ilse in a nasty voice, 'have to be
<i>born.</i> They can't be <i>made,</i> you know.'</p>

<p>"Ilse has almost given up calling names, as she used to do when
she quarrelled with Perry or me, and taken to saying cruel, cutting
things. They hurt far worse than the names used to, but I don't
really mind them&mdash;much&mdash;or long&mdash;because I know Ilse
doesn't mean them and really loves me as much as I love her. But
Perry says they stick in his crop. They didn't speak to each other
the rest of the way home, but next day Ilse was at him again about
using bad grammar and not standing up when a lady enters the
room.</p>

<p>"'Of course you couldn't be expected to know <i>that,'</i> she
said in her nastiest voice, 'but I am sure Mr. Carpenter has done
his best to teach you grammar.'</p>

<p>"Perry didn't say one word to Ilse, but he turned to me.</p>

<p>"'Will <i>you</i> tell me my faults?' he said. 'I don't mind
<i>you</i> doing it&mdash;it will be <i>you</i> that will have to
put up with me when we're grown up, not Ilse.'</p>

<p>"He said that to make Ilse angry, but it made me angrier still,
for it was an allusion to a <i>forbidden topic.</i> So we neither
of us spoke to him for two days and he said it was a good rest from
Ilse's slams anyway.</p>

<p>"Perry is not the only one who gets into disgrace at New Moon. I
said something silly yesterday evening which makes me blush to
recall it. The Ladies' Aid met here and Aunt Elizabeth gave them a
supper and the husbands of the Aid came to it. Ilse and I waited on
the table, which was set in the kitchen because the dining-room
table wasn't long enough. It was exciting at first and then, when
every one was served, it was a little dull and I began to compose
some poetry in my mind as I stood by the window looking out on the
garden. It was so interesting that I soon forgot everything else
until suddenly I heard Aunt Elizabeth say, 'Emily,' very sharply,
and then she looked significantly at Mr. Johnson, our new minister.
I was confused and I snatched up the teapot and exclaimed,</p>

<p>"'Oh, Mr. <i>Cup,</i> will you have your <i>Johnson</i>
filled?'</p>

<p>"Everybody roared and Aunt Elizabeth looked disgusted and Aunt
Laura ashamed, and I felt as if I would sink through the floor. I
couldn't sleep half the night for thinking over it. The strange
thing was that I do believe I felt worse and more ashamed than I
would have felt if I had done something really wrong. This is the
'Murray pride' of course, and I suppose it is very wicked.
Sometimes I am afraid Aunt Ruth Dutton is right in her opinion of
me after all.</p>

<p>"No, she isn't!</p>

<p>"But it is a tradition of New Moon that its women should be
equal to any situation and always be graceful and dignified. Now,
there was nothing graceful or dignified in asking such a question
of the new minister. I am sure he will never see me again without
thinking of it and I will always writhe when I catch his eye upon
me.</p>

<p>"But now that I have written it out in my diary I don't feel so
badly over it. <i>Nothing</i> ever seems as big or as
terrible&mdash;oh, nor as beautiful and grand, either,
alas!&mdash;when it is written out, as it does when you are
thinking or feeling about it. It seems to <i>shrink</i> directly
you put it into words. Even the line of poetry I had made just
before I asked that absurd question won't seem half as fine when I
write it down:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Where the velvet feet of darkness softly go.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>"It <i>doesn't.</i> Some bloom seems gone from it. And yet,
while I was standing there, behind all those chattering, eating
people, and <i>saw</i> darkness stealing so softly over the garden
and the hills, like a beautiful woman robed in shadows, with stars
for eyes, the <i>flash</i> came and I forgot everything but that I
wanted to put something of the beauty I felt into the words of my
poem. When that line came into my mind it didn't seem to me that
<i>I</i> composed it at all&mdash;it seemed as if <i>Something
Else</i> were trying to speak through me&mdash;and it was that
<i>Something Else</i> that made the line seem wonderful&mdash;and
now when it is gone the words seem flat and foolish and the picture
I tried to draw in them not so wonderful after all.</p>

<p>"Oh, if I could only put things into words as I <i>see</i> them!
Mr. Carpenter says, 'Strive&mdash;strive&mdash;keep on&mdash;words
are your medium&mdash;make them your slaves&mdash;until they will
say for you what you want them to say.' That is true&mdash;and I do
try&mdash;but it seems to me there is something <i>beyond</i>
words&mdash;any words&mdash;all words&mdash;something that always
escapes you when you try to grasp it&mdash;and yet leaves something
in your hand which you wouldn't have had if you hadn't reached for
it.</p>

<p>"I remember one day last fall when Dean and I walked over the
Delectable Mountain to the woods beyond it&mdash;fir woods mostly,
but with one corner of splendid old pines. We sat under them and
Dean read <i>Peveril of the Peak</i> and some of Scott's poems to
me; and then he looked up into the big, plumy boughs and said,</p>

<p>"'The gods are talking in the pines&mdash;gods of the old
northland&mdash;of the viking sagas. Star, do you know Emerson's
lines?'</p>

<p>"And then he quoted them&mdash;I've remembered and loved them
ever since.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"The gods talk in the breath of the wold,<br>
They talk in the shaken pine,<br>
And they fill the reach of the old seashore<br>
With dialogue divine;<br>
And the poet who overhears<br>
One random word they say<br>
Is the fated man of men<br>
Whom the ages must obey.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>"Oh, that 'random word'&mdash;that is the <i>Something</i> that
escapes me. I'm always listening for it&mdash;I know I can never
hear it&mdash;my ear isn't attuned to it&mdash;but I am sure I hear
at times a little, faint, far-off echo of it&mdash;and it makes me
feel a delight that is like pain and a despair of ever being able
to translate its beauty into any words I know.</p>

<p>"Still, it <i>is</i> a pity I made such a goose of myself
immediately after that wonderful experience.</p>

<p>"If I had just floated up behind Mr. Johnson, as velvet-footedly
as darkness herself, and poured his tea gracefully from
Great-grandmother Murray's silver teapot, like my shadow-woman
pouring night into the white cup of Blair Valley, Aunt Elizabeth
would be far better pleased with me than if I could write the most
wonderful poem in the world.</p>

<p>"Cousin Jimmy is so different. I recited my poem to him this
evening after we had finished with the catalogue and he thought it
was beautiful. <i>(He</i> couldn't know how far it fell short of
what I had seen in my mind.) Cousin Jimmy composes poetry himself.
He is very clever in spots. And in other spots, where his brain was
hurt when Aunt Elizabeth pushed him into our New Moon well, he
isn't <i>anything.</i> There's just <i>blankness</i> there. So
people call him simple, and Aunt Ruth dares to say he hasn't sense
enough to shoo a cat from cream. And yet if you put all his clever
spots together there isn't anybody in Blair Water has half as much
real cleverness as he has&mdash;not even Mr. Carpenter. The trouble
is you can't put his clever spots together&mdash;there are always
those gaps between. But I love Cousin Jimmy and I'm never in the
least afraid of him when his queer spells come on him. Everybody
else is&mdash;even Aunt Elizabeth, though perhaps it is remorse
with her, instead of fear&mdash;except Perry. Perry always brags
that he is never afraid of anything&mdash;doesn't know what fear
is. I think that is very wonderful. I wish I could be so fearless.
Mr. Carpenter says fear is a vile thing, and is at the bottom of
almost every wrong and hatred of the world.</p>

<p>"'Cast it out, Jade,' he says&mdash;'cast it out of your heart.
Fear is a confession of weakness. What you fear is stronger than
you, or you think it is, else you wouldn't be afraid of it.
Remember your Emerson&mdash;"always do what you are afraid to
do."'</p>

<p>"But that is a counsel of perfection, as Dean says, and I don't
believe I'll ever be able to attain to it. To be honest, I am
afraid of a good many <i>things,</i> but there are only two people
in the world I'm truly afraid of. One is Mrs. Kent, and the other
is Mad Mr. Morrison. I'm terribly afraid of him and I think almost
every one is. His home is in Derry Pond, but he hardly ever stays
there&mdash;he roams over the country looking for his lost bride.
He was married only a few weeks when his young wife died, many
years ago, and he has never been right in his mind since. He
insists she is not dead, only lost, and that he will find her some
time. He has grown old and bent, looking for her, but to him she is
still young and fair.</p>

<p>"He was here one day last summer, but would not come
in&mdash;just peered into the kitchen wistfully and said, 'Is Annie
here?' He was quite gentle that day, but sometimes he is very wild
and violent. He declares he always hears Annie calling to
him&mdash;that her voice flits on before him&mdash;always before
him, like my random word. His face is wrinkled and shrivelled and
he looks like an old, old monkey. But the thing I hate most about
him is his right hand&mdash;it is a deep blood-red all
over&mdash;birth-marked. I can't tell why, but that hand fills me
with horror. I could not bear to touch it. And sometimes he laughs
to himself very horribly. The only living thing he seems to care
for is his old black dog that always is with him. They say he will
never ask for a bite of food for himself. If people do not offer it
to him he goes hungry, but he will beg for his dog.</p>

<p>"Oh, I am terribly afraid of him, and I was so glad he didn't
come into the house that day. Aunt Elizabeth looked after him, as
he went away with his long, gray hair streaming in the wind, and
said,</p>

<p>"'Fairfax Morrison was once a fine, clever, young man, with
excellent prospects. Well, God's ways are very mysterious.'</p>

<p>"'That is why they are interesting,' I said.</p>

<p>"But Aunt Elizabeth frowned and told me not to be irreverent, as
she always does when I say anything about God. I wonder why. She
won't let Perry and me talk about Him, either, though Perry is
really very much interested in Him and wants to find out all about
Him. Aunt Elizabeth overheard me telling Perry one Sunday afternoon
what I thought God was like, and she said it was scandalous.</p>

<p>"It wasn't! The trouble is, Aunt Elizabeth and I have different
Gods, that is all. Everybody has a different God, I think. Aunt
Ruth's, for instance, is one that punishes her enemies&mdash;sends
'judgments' on them. That seems to me to be about all the use He
really is to her. Jim Cosgrain uses his to swear by. But Aunt Janey
Milburn walks in the light of her God's countenance, every day, and
shines with it.</p>

<p>"I have written myself out for to-night, and am going to bed. I
know I have 'wasted words' in this diary&mdash;another of my
literary faults, according to Mr. Carpenter.</p>

<p>"'You waste words, Jade&mdash;you spill them about too lavishly.
Economy and restraint&mdash;that's what you need.</p>

<p>"He's right, of course, and in my essays and stories I try to
practise what he preaches. But in my diary, which nobody sees but
myself, or ever will see until after I'm dead, I like just to let
myself go."</p>

<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

<p>Emily looked at her candle&mdash;it, too, was almost burned out.
She knew she could not have another that night&mdash;Aunt
Elizabeth's rules were as those of Mede and Persian: she put away
her diary in the little right-hand cupboard above the mantel,
covered her dying fire, undressed and blew out her candle. The room
slowly filled with the faint, ghostly snow-light of a night when a
full moon is behind the driving storm-clouds. And just as Emily was
ready to slip into her high black bedstead a sudden inspiration
came&mdash;a splendid new idea for a story. For a minute she
shivered reluctantly: the room was getting cold. But the idea would
not be denied. Emily slipped her hand between the feather tick of
her bed and the chaff mattress and produced a half-burned candle,
secreted there for just such an emergency.</p>

<p>It was not, of course, a proper thing to do. But then I have
never pretended, nor ever will pretend, that Emily was a proper
child. Books are not written about proper children. They would be
so dull nobody would read them.</p>

<p>She lighted her candle, put on her stockings and a heavy coat,
got out another half-filled Jimmy-book, and began to write by the
single, uncertain candle which made a pale oasis of light in the
shadows of the room. In that oasis Emily wrote, her black head bent
over her book, as the hours of night crept away and the other
occupants of New Moon slumbered soundly; she grew chill and
cramped, but she was quite unconscious of it. Her eyes
burned&mdash;her cheeks glowed&mdash;words came like troops of
obedient genii to the call of her pen. When at last her candle went
out with a splutter and a hiss in its little pool of melted tallow,
she came back to reality with a sigh and a shiver. It was two, by
the clock, and she was very tired and very cold; but she had
finished her story and it was the best she had ever written. She
crept into her cold nest with a sense of completion and victory,
born of the working out of her creative impulse, and fell asleep to
the lullaby of the waning storm.</p>

<h2><a name="c02" id="c02"><i>Salad Days</i></a>
</h2>

<p>This book is not going to be wholly, or even mainly, made up of
extracts from Emily's diary; but, by way of linking up matters
unimportant enough for a chapter in themselves, and yet necessary
for a proper understanding of her personality and environment, I am
going to include some more of them. Besides, when one has material
ready to hand, why not use it? Emily's "diary," with all its
youthful crudities and italics, really gives a better
interpretation of her and of her imaginative and introspective
mind, in that, her fourteenth spring, than any biographer, however
sympathetic, could do. So let us take another peep into the
yellowed pages of that old "Jimmy-book," written long ago in the
"look-out" of New Moon.</p>

<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

<p>"February 15, 19&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have decided that I will write down, in this journal, every
day, all my good deeds and all my bad ones. I got the idea out of a
book, and it appeals to me. I mean to be as honest about it as I
can. It will be easy, of course, to write down the good deeds, but
not so easy to record the bad ones.</p>

<p>"I did only one bad thing to-day&mdash;only one thing I think
bad, that is. I was impertinent to Aunt Elizabeth. She thought I
took too long washing the dishes. I didn't suppose there was any
hurry and I was composing a story called <i>The Secret of the
Mill.</i> Aunt Elizabeth looked at me and then at the clock, and
said in her most disagreeable way,</p>

<p>"'Is the snail your sister, Emily?'</p>

<p>"'No! Snails are no relation to <i>me</i>,' I said
<i>haughtily.</i></p>

<p>"It was not what I said, but the way I said it that was
impertinent. <i>And I meant it to be.</i> I was very
angry&mdash;sarcastic speeches always aggravate me. Afterwards I
was very sorry that I had been in a temper&mdash;but I was sorry
because it was <i>foolish</i> and <i>undignified,</i> not because
it was <i>wicked.</i> So I suppose that was not true
repentance.</p>

<p>"As for my good deeds, I did two to-day. I saved two little
lives. Saucy Sal had caught a poor snowbird and I took it from her.
It flew off quite briskly, and I am sure it felt wonderfully happy.
Later on I went down to the cellar cupboard and found a mouse
caught in a trap by its foot. The poor thing lay there, almost
exhausted from struggling, with <i>such</i> a look in its black
eyes. I <i>couldn't</i> endure it so I set it free, and it managed
to get away quite smartly in spite of its foot. I do not feel
<i>sure</i> about <i>this</i> deed. I know it was a good one from
the mouse's point of view, but what about Aunt Elizabeth's?</p>

<p>"This evening Aunt Laura and Aunt Elizabeth read and burned a
boxful of old letters. They read them aloud and commented on them,
while I sat in a corner and knitted my stockings. The letters were
very interesting and I learned a great deal about the Murrays I had
never known before. I feel that it is quite wonderful to belong to
a family like this. No wonder the Blair Water folks call us 'the
Chosen People'&mdash;though <i>they</i> don't mean it as a
compliment. I feel that I must live up to the traditions of my
family.</p>

<p>"I had a long letter from Dean Priest to-day. He is spending the
winter in Algiers. He says he is coming home in April and is going
to take rooms with his sister, Mrs. Fred Evans, for the summer. I
am so glad. It will be splendid to have him in Blair Water all
summer. Nobody ever talks to me as Dean does. He is the nicest and
most interesting old person I know. Aunt Elizabeth says he is
selfish, as all the Priests are. But then she does not like the
Priests. And she always calls him Jarback, which somehow sets my
teeth on edge. One of Dean's shoulders <i>is</i> a little higher
than the other, but that is not his fault. I told Aunt Elizabeth
once that I wished she would not call my friend that, but she only
said,</p>

<p>"'<i>I</i> did not nickname <i>your friend,</i> Emily. His own
clan have always called him Jarback. The Priests are not noted for
delicacy!"</p>

<p>"Teddy had a letter from Dean, too, and a book&mdash;<i>The
Lives of Great Artists</i>&mdash;Michael Angelo, Raphael,
Velasquez, Rembrandt, Titian. He says he dare not let his mother
see him reading it&mdash;she would burn it. I am sure if Teddy
could only have his chance he would be as great an artist as any of
them.</p>

<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

<p>"February 18, 19&mdash;</p>

<p>"I had a lovely time with myself this evening, after school,
walking on the brook road in Lofty John's bush. The sun was low and
creamy and the snow so white and the shadows so slender and blue. I
think there is nothing so beautiful as tree shadows. And when I
came out into the garden my own shadow looked so funny&mdash;so
long that it stretched right across the garden. I immediately made
a poem of which two lines were,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"If we were as tall as our shadows<br>
How tall our shadows would be.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>"I think there is a good deal of <i>philosophy</i> in that.</p>

<p>"To-night I wrote a story and Aunt Elizabeth knew what I was
doing and was very much annoyed. She scolded me for wasting time.
But it <i>wasn't</i> wasted time. I <i>grew</i> in it&mdash;I know
I did. And there was something about some of the sentences I liked.
'<i>I</i> <i>am afraid of the grey wood'</i>&mdash;that pleased me
very much. And&mdash;'white and stately she walked the dark wood
like a moonbeam.' I think that is rather fine. Yet Mr. Carpenter
tells me that whenever I think a thing especially fine I am to cut
it out. But oh, I <i>can't</i> cut that out&mdash;not yet, at
least. The strange part is that about three months after Mr.
Carpenter tells me to cut a thing out I come round to his point of
view and feel ashamed of it. Mr. Carpenter was quite merciless over
my essay to-day. Nothing about it suited him.</p>

<p>"'Three <i>alas's</i> in one paragraph, Emily. One would have
been too many in this year of grace!' <i>'More
irresistible</i>&mdash;Emily, for heaven's sake, write English!
That is unpardonable.'</p>

<p>"It <i>was,</i> too. I saw it for myself and I felt shame going
all over me from head to foot like a red wave. Then, after Mr.
Carpenter had blue-pencilled almost every sentence and sneered at
all my fine phrases and found fault with most of my constructions
and told me I was too fond of putting 'cleverisms' into everything
I wrote, he flung my exercise book down, tore at his hair and
said,</p>

<p>"'You write! Jade, get a spoon and learn to cook!'</p>

<p>"Then he strode off, muttering maledictions 'not loud but deep.'
I picked up my poor essay and didn't feel very badly. I <i>can</i>
cook already, and I have learned a thing or two about Mr.
Carpenter. The better my essays are the more he rages over them.
This one must have been quite good. But it makes him so angry and
impatient to see where I might have made it <i>still better</i> and
didn't&mdash;through carelessness or laziness or
indifference&mdash;as he thinks. And he can't tolerate a person who
<i>could</i> do better and doesn't. And he wouldn't bother with me
at all if he didn't think I may amount to something by and by.</p>

<p>"Aunt Elizabeth does not approve of Mr. Johnson. She thinks his
theology is not sound. He said in his sermon last Sunday that there
was some good in Buddhism.</p>

<p>"'He will be saying that there is some good in Popery next,'
said Aunt Elizabeth indignantly at the dinner-table.</p>

<p>"There <i>may</i> be some good in Buddhism. I must ask Dean
about it when he comes home.</p>

<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

<p>"March 2, 19&mdash;</p>

<p>"We were all at a funeral to-day&mdash;old Mrs. Sarah Paul. I
have always liked going to funerals. When I said that, Aunt
Elizabeth looked shocked and Aunt Laura said, 'Oh, Emily
<i>dear!'</i> I rather like to shock Aunt Elizabeth, but I never
feel comfortable if I worry Aunt Laura&mdash;she's <i>such</i> a
darling&mdash;so I explained&mdash;or tried to. It is sometimes
very hard to explain things to Aunt Elizabeth.</p>

<p>"'Funerals are interesting,' I said. 'And humorous, too.'</p>

<p>"I think I only made matters worse by saying <i>that.</i> And
yet Aunt Elizabeth knew as well as I did that it was funny to see
some of those relatives of Mrs. Paul, who have fought with and
hated her for years&mdash;she <i>wasn't</i> amiable, if she is
dead!&mdash;sitting there, holding their handkerchiefs to their
faces and pretending to cry. I knew quite well what each and every
one was thinking in his heart. Jake Paul was wondering if the old
harridan had by any chance left him anything in her will&mdash;and
Alice Paul, who knew <i>she</i> wouldn't get anything, was hoping
Jake Paul wouldn't either. That would satisfy <i>her.</i> And Mrs.
Charles Paul was wondering how soon it would be decent to do the
house over the way she had always wanted it and Mrs. Paul
<i>hadn't.</i> And Aunty Min was worrying for fear there wouldn't
be enough baked meats for such a mob of fourth cousins that they'd
never expected and didn't want, and Lisette Paul was counting the
people and feeling vexed because there wasn't as large an
attendance as there was at Mrs. Henry Lister's funeral last week.
When I told Aunt Laura this, she said gravely,</p>

<p>"'All this may be true, Emily'&mdash;(she knew it
was!)&mdash;'but somehow it doesn't seem quite right for so young a
girl as you, to&mdash;to&mdash;to be able to see these things, in
short.'</p>

<p>"However, I can't help seeing them. Darling Aunt Laura is always
so sorry for people that she can't see their humorous side. But I
saw other things too. I saw that little Zack Fritz, whom Mrs. Paul
adopted and was very kind to, was almost broken-hearted, and I saw
that Martha Paul was feeling sorry and ashamed to think of her
bitter old quarrel with Mrs. Paul&mdash;and I saw that Mrs. Paul's
face, that looked so discontented and thwarted in life, looked
peaceful and majestic and even beautiful&mdash;as if Death had
<i>satisfied</i> her at last.</p>

<p>"Yes, funerals <i>are</i> interesting.</p>

<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

<p>"March 5, 19&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is snowing a little to-night. I love to see the snow coming
down in slanting lines against the dark trees.</p>

<p>"I <i>think</i> I did a good deed to-day. Jason Merrowby was
here helping Cousin Jimmy saw wood&mdash;and I <i>saw him sneak
into the pighouse, and take a swig from a whisky bottle.</i> But I
did not say one word about it to anyone&mdash;that is my good
deed.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I <i>ought</i> to tell Aunt Elizabeth, but if I did she
would never have him again, and he needs all the work he can get,
for his poor wife's and children's sakes. I find it is not always
easy to be sure whether your deeds are good or bad.</p>

<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

<p>"March 20, 19&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yesterday Aunt Elizabeth was very angry because I would not
write an 'obituary poem' for old Peter DeGeer who died last week.
Mrs. DeGeer came here and asked me to do it. I wouldn't&mdash;I
felt very indignant at such a request. I felt it would be <i>a
desecration of my art</i> to do such a thing&mdash;though of course
I didn't say that to Mrs. DeGeer. For one thing it would have hurt
her feelings, and for another she wouldn't have had the faintest
idea what I meant. Even Aunt Elizabeth hadn't when I told her my
reasons for refusing, after Mrs. DeGeer had gone.</p>

<p>"'You are always writing yards of trash that nobody wants,' she
said. 'I think you might write something that <i>is</i> wanted. It
would have pleased poor old Mary DeGeer. "Desecration of your art"
indeed. If you <i>must</i> talk, Emily, why not talk sense?'</p>

<p>"I proceeded to talk sense.</p>

<p>"'Aunt Elizabeth,' I said seriously, 'how could I write that
obituary poem for her? I couldn't write an <i>untruthful</i> one to
please anybody. And you know yourself that nothing good <i>and</i>
truthful could be said about old Peter DeGeer!'</p>

<p>"Aunt Elizabeth did know it, and it posed her, but she was all
the more displeased with me for that. She vexed me so much that I
came up to my room and wrote an 'obituary poem' about Peter, just
for my own satisfaction. It is certainly great fun to write a
<i>truthful</i> obituary of some one you don't like. Not that I
<i>disliked</i> Peter DeGeer; I just despised him as everybody did.
But Aunt Elizabeth had annoyed me, and when I am annoyed I can
write very sarcastically. And again I felt that <i>Something</i>
was writing through me&mdash;but a very different <i>Something</i>
from the usual one&mdash;a malicious, mocking <i>Something</i> that
<i>enjoyed</i> making fun of poor, lazy, shiftless, lying, silly,
hypocritical, old Peter DeGeer.
Ideas&mdash;words&mdash;rhymes&mdash;all seemed to drop into place
while that <i>Something</i> chuckled.</p>

<p>"I thought the poem was so clever that I couldn't resist the
temptation to take it to school to-day and show it to Mr Carpenter.
I thought he would enjoy it&mdash;and I think he <i>did,</i> too,
in a way, but after he had read it he laid it down and looked at
me.</p>

<p>"'I suppose there <i>is</i> a pleasure in satirizing a failure,'
he said. 'Poor old Peter was a failure&mdash;and he is
dead&mdash;and His Maker may be merciful to him, but his fellow
creatures will not. When <i>I</i> am dead, Emily, will you write
like this about me? You have the power&mdash;oh, yes, it's all
here&mdash;this <i>is</i> very clever. You can paint the weakness
and foolishness and wickedness of a character in a way that is
positively uncanny, in a girl of your age. But&mdash;is it worth
while, Emily?'</p>

<p>"'No&mdash;no,' I said. I was so ashamed and sorry that I wanted
to get away and cry. It was terrible to think Mr. Carpenter
imagined I would ever write so about <i>him,</i> after all he has
done for me.</p>

<p>"'It isn't,' said Mr. Carpenter. 'There is a place for
satire&mdash;there are gangrenes that can only be burned
out&mdash;but leave the burning to the great geniuses. It's better
to heal than hurt. We failures know that.'</p>

<p>"'Oh, Mr. Carpenter!' I began. I wanted to say <i>he</i> wasn't
a failure&mdash;I wanted to say a hundred things&mdash;but he
wouldn't let me.</p>

<p>"'There&mdash;there, we won't talk of it, Emily. When <i>I</i>
am dead say, "He was a failure, and none knew it more truly or felt
it more bitterly than himself." Be merciful to the failures, Emily.
Satirize wickedness if you must&mdash;but pity weakness.'</p>

<p>"He stalked off then, and called school in. I've felt wretched
ever since and I won't sleep to-night. But here and now I record
this vow, most solemnly, in my diary, <i>My pen shall heal, not
hurt.</i> And I write it in italics, Early Victorian or not,
because I am tremendously in earnest.</p>

<p>"I didn't tear that poem up, though&mdash;I couldn't&mdash;it
really <i>was</i> too good to destroy. I put it away in my literary
cupboard to read over once in a while for my own enjoyment, but I
will never show it to anybody.</p>

<p>"Oh, how I wish I hadn't hurt Mr. Carpenter!</p>

<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

<p>"April 1, 19&mdash;</p>

<p>"Something I heard a visitor in Blair Water say today annoyed me
very much. Mr. and Mrs. Alec Sawyer, who live in Charlottetown,
were in the post office when I was there. Mrs. Sawyer is very
handsome and fashionable and condescending. I heard her say to her
husband, <i>'How</i> do the natives of this sleepy place continue
to live here year in and year out? <i>I</i> should go mad.
<i>Nothing</i> ever happens here.'</p>

<p>"I would dearly have liked to tell her a few things about Blair
Water. I could have been sarcastic with a vengeance. But, of
course, New Moon people <i>do not make scenes in public.</i> So I
contented myself with bowing <i>very coldly</i> when she spoke to
me and <i>sweeping past</i> her. I heard Mr. Sawyer say, 'Who is
that girl?' and Mrs. Sawyer said, 'She must be that Starr
puss&mdash;she has the Murray trick of holding her head, all
right.'</p>

<p>"The idea of saying 'nothing ever happens here'! Why, things are
happening right along&mdash;<i>thrilling</i> things. I think life
here is <i>extremely</i> wonderful. We have always so much to laugh
and cry and talk about.</p>

<p>"Look at all the things that have happened in Blair Water in
just the last three weeks&mdash;comedy and tragedy all mixed up
together. James Baxter has suddenly stopped speaking to his wife
and <i>nobody knows why. She</i> doesn't, poor soul, and she is
breaking her heart about it. Old Adam Gillian, who hated pretence
of any sort, died two weeks ago and his last words were, 'See that
there isn't any howling and sniffling at my funeral.' So nobody
howled or sniffled. Nobody wanted to, and since he had forbidden it
nobody pretended to. There never was such a cheerful funeral in
Blair Water. I've seen weddings that were more
melancholy&mdash;Ella Brice's, for instance. What cast a cloud over
hers was that she forgot to put on her white slippers when she
dressed, and went down to the parlour in a pair of old, faded,
bedroom shoes with holes in the toes. Really, people couldn't have
talked more about it if she had gone down without <i>anything</i>
on. Poor Ella cried all through the wedding-supper about it.</p>

<p>"Old Robert Scobie and his half-sister have quarrelled, after
living together for thirty years without a fuss, although she is
said to be a very aggravating woman. Nothing she did or said ever
provoked Robert into an outburst, but it seems that there was just
one doughnut left from supper one evening recently, and Robert is
very fond of doughnuts. He put it away in the pantry for a bedtime
snack, and when he went to get it he found that Matilda had eaten
it. He went into a terrible rage, pulled her nose, called her a
<i>she-deviless,</i> and ordered her out of his house. She has gone
to live with her sister at Derry Pond, and Robert is going to bach
it. Neither of them will ever forgive the other, Scobie-like, and
neither will ever be happy or contented again.</p>

<p>"George Lake was walking home from Derry Pond one moonlit
evening two weeks ago, and <i>all at once</i> he saw another
<i>very black</i> shadow going along beside his, on the moonlit
snow.</p>

<p><i>"And there was nothing to cast that shadow.</i>
</p>

<p>He rushed to the nearest house, nearly dead with fright, and
they say he will never be the same man again.</p>

<p>"This is the most <i>dramatic</i> thing that has happened. It
makes me shiver as I write of it. Of course George <i>must</i> have
been mistaken. But he is a truthful man, and he doesn't drink. I
don't know what to think of it.</p>

<p>"Arminius Scobie is a <i>very mean man</i> and always buys his
wife's hats for her, lest she pay too much for them. They know this
in the Shrewsbury stores, and laugh at him. One day last week he
was in Jones and McCallum's, buying her a hat, and Mr. Jones told
him that if he would <i>wear the hat</i> from the store to the
station he would let him have it for nothing. Arminius did. It was
a quarter of a mile to the station and all the small boys in
Shrewsbury ran after him and hooted him. But Arminus didn't care.
He had saved three dollars and forty-nine cents.</p>

<p><i>"And,</i> one evening, right here at New Moon, I dropped a
soft-boiled egg on Aunt Elizabeth's second-best cashmere dress.
That <i>was</i> a happening. A kingdom might have been upset in
Europe, and it wouldn't have made such a commotion at New Moon.</p>

<p>"So, Mistress Sawyer, you are vastly mistaken. Besides, apart
from all happenings, the folks here are interesting in themselves.
I don't <i>like</i> every one but I find every one
interesting&mdash;Miss Matty Small, who is forty and wears
<i>outrageous</i> colours&mdash;she wore an old-rose dress and a
scarlet hat to church all last summer&mdash;old Uncle Reuben
Bascom, who is so lazy that he held an umbrella over himself all
one rainy night in bed, when the roof began to leak, rather than
get out and move the bed&mdash;Elder McCloskey, who thought it
wouldn't do to say 'pants' in a story he was telling about a
missionary, at prayer-meeting, so always said politely 'the clothes
of his lower parts'&mdash;Amasa Derry, who carried off four prizes
at the Exhibition last fall, with vegetables he stole from Ronnie
Bascom's field, while Ronnie didn't get one prize&mdash;Jimmy Joe
Belle, who came here from Derry Pond yesterday to get some lumber
'to beeld a henhouse for my leetle dog'&mdash;old Luke Elliott, who
is such a systematic fiend that he even draws up a schedule of the
year on New Year's day, and charts down all the days he means to
get drunk on&mdash;<i>and sticks to it:</i>&mdash;they're all
interesting and amusing and delightful.</p>

<p>"There, I've proved Mrs. Alex Sawyer to be so completely wrong
that I feel quite kindly towards her, even though she did call me a
puss.</p>

<p>"Why don't I like being called a puss, when cats are such nice
things? And I like being called <i>pussy.</i></p>

<p>"Two weeks ago I sent my very best poem, <i>Wind Song,</i> to a
magazine in New York, and to-day it came back with just a little
<i>printed slip</i> saying, 'We regret we cannot use this
contribution.'</p>

<p>"I feel dreadfully. I suppose I can't really write anything that
is any good.</p>

<p>"I <i>can.</i> That magazine will be <i>glad</i> to print my
pieces some day!</p>

<p>"I didn't tell Mr. Carpenter I sent it. I wouldn't get any
sympathy from him. <i>He</i> says that five years from now will be
time enough to begin pestering editors. But I <i>know</i> that some
poems I've read in that very magazine were not a bit better than
<i>Wind Song.</i></p>

<p>"I feel more like writing poetry in spring than at any other
time. Mr. Carpenter tells me to fight against the impulse. He says
spring has been responsible for more trash than anything else in
the universe of God.</p>

<p>"May 1, 19&mdash;</p>

<p>"Dean is home. He came to his sister's yesterday and this
evening he was here and we walked in the garden, up and down the
sundial walk, and talked. It was splendid to have him back, with
his mysterious green eyes and his nice mouth.</p>

<p>"We had a long conversation. We talked of Algiers and the
transmigration of souls and of being cremated and of
profiles&mdash;Dean says I have a good profile&mdash;'pure Greek.'
I always like Dean's compliments.</p>

<p>"'Star o' Morning, how you have grown!' he said. 'I left a child
last autumn&mdash;and I find a woman!'</p>

<p>"(I will be fourteen in three weeks, and I am tall for my age.
Dean seems to be glad of this&mdash;quite unlike Aunt Laura who
always sighs when she lengthens my dresses, and thinks children
grow up too fast.)</p>

<p>"'So goes time by,' I said, quoting the motto on the sundial,
and feeling <i>quite sophisticated.</i></p>

<p>"'You are almost as tall as I am,' he said; and then added
<i>bitterly,</i> 'to be sure Jarback Priest is of no very stately
height.'</p>

<p>"I have always shrunk from referring to his shoulder in any way,
but now I said,</p>

<p>"'Dean, please don't sneer at yourself like that&mdash;not with
me, at least. I <i>never</i> think of you as Jarback.'</p>

<p>"Dean took my hand and looked right into my eyes as if he were
trying to <i>read my very soul.</i></p>

<p>"'Are you sure of that, Emily? Don't you often wish that I
wasn't lame&mdash;and crooked?'</p>

<p>"'For your sake I do,' I answered, 'but as far as I am concerned
it doesn't make a bit of difference&mdash;and never will.'</p>

<p>"'And never will!' Dean repeated the words emphatically. 'If I
were sure of that, Emily&mdash;if I were only sure of that.'</p>

<p>"'You <i>can</i> be sure of it,' I declared quite warmly. I was
vexed because he seemed to doubt it&mdash;and yet something in his
expression made me feel a little uncomfortable. It suddenly made me
think of the time he rescued me from the cliff on Malvern Bay and
told me my life belonged to him since he had saved it. I don't like
the thought of my life belonging to any one but myself&mdash;not
<i>any one,</i> even Dean, much as I like him. And <i>in some
ways</i> I like Dean better than any one in the world.</p>

<p>"When it got darker the stars came out and we studied them
through Dean's splendid new field-glasses. It was very fascinating.
Dean knows all about the stars&mdash;it seems to me he knows all
about everything. But when I said so, he said,</p>

<p>"'There is one secret I do not know&mdash;I would give
everything else I <i>do</i> know for it&mdash;one
secret&mdash;perhaps I shall never know it. The way to
win&mdash;the way to win&mdash;'</p>

<p>"'What?' I asked curiously.</p>

<p>"'My heart's desire,' said Dean dreamily, looking at a
shimmering star that seemed to be hung on the very tip of one of
the Three Princesses. 'It seems now as desirable and unobtainable
as that gem-like star, Emily. But&mdash;who knows?'</p>

<p>"I wonder what it is Dean wants so much.</p>

<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

<p>"May 4, 19&mdash;</p>

<p>"Dean brought me a lovely portfolio from Paris, and I have
copied my favourite verse from <i>The Fringed Gentian</i> on the
inside of the cover. I will read it over every day and remember my
vow to 'climb the Alpine Path.' I begin to see that I will have to
do a good bit of scrambling, though I once expected, I think, to
soar right up to 'that far-off goal' on shining wings. Mr.
Carpenter has banished that fond dream.</p>

<p>"'Dig in your toes and hang on with your teeth&mdash;that's the
only way,' he says.</p>

<p>"Last night in bed I thought out some lovely titles for the
books I'm going to write in the future&mdash;<i>A Lady of High
Degree, True to Faith and Vow, Oh, Rare Pale Margaret</i> (I got
that from Tennyson), <i>The Caste of Vere de Vere</i> (ditto) and
<i>A Kingdom by the Sea.</i></p>

<p>"Now, if I can only get ideas to match the titles!</p>

<p>"I am writing a story called <i>The House Among the
Rowans</i>&mdash;also a very good title, I think. But the love talk
still bothers me. Everything of the kind I write seems so stiff and
silly the minute I write it down that it infuriates me. I asked
Dean if he could teach me how to write it properly because he
promised long ago that he would, but he said I was too young
yet&mdash;said it in that mysterious way of his which always seems
to convey the idea that there is so much more in his words than the
mere sound of them expresses. I wish I could speak so
<i>significantly,</i> because it makes you <i>very
interesting.</i></p>

<p>"This evening after school Dean and I began to read <i>The
Alhambra</i> over again, sitting on the stone bench in the garden.
That book always makes me feel as if I had opened a little door and
stepped straight into fairyland.</p>

<p>"'How I would love to see the Alhambra!' I said.</p>

<p>"'We will go to see it sometime&mdash;together,' said Dean.</p>

<p>"'Oh, that would be <i>lovely,'</i> I cried. 'Do you think we
can ever manage it, Dean?'</p>

<p>"Before Dean could answer I heard Teddy's whistle in Lofty
John's bush&mdash;the dear little whistle of two short high notes
and one long low one, that is <i>our signal.</i></p>

<p>"'Excuse me&mdash;I must go&mdash;Teddy's calling me,' I
said.</p>

<p>"'Must you always go when Teddy calls?' asked Dean.</p>

<p>"I nodded and explained,</p>

<p>"'He only calls like that when he wants me <i>especially</i> and
I have promised I will always go if I possibly can.'</p>

<p>"'<i>I</i> want you <i>especially!'</i> said Dean. 'I came up
this evening on purpose to read <i>The Alhambra</i> with you.'</p>

<p>"Suddenly I felt very unhappy. I wanted to stay with Dean
dreadfully, and yet I felt as if I must go to Teddy. Dean looked at
me piercingly. Then he shut up <i>The Alhambra.</i></p>

<p>"'Go,' he said.</p>

<p>"I went&mdash;but things seemed spoiled, somehow.</p>

<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

<p>"May 10, 19&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have been reading three books Dean lent me this week. One was
like a rose garden&mdash;very pleasant, but just a little too
sweet. And one was like a pine wood on a mountain&mdash;full of
balsam and tang&mdash;I loved it, and yet it filled me with a sort
of despair. It was written so beautifully&mdash;I can <i>never</i>
write like that, I feel sure. And one&mdash;it was just like a
pigsty. Dean gave me that one by mistake. He was very angry with
himself when he found it out&mdash;angry and distressed.</p>

<p>"'Star&mdash;Star&mdash;I would <i>never</i> have given you a
book like that&mdash;my confounded carelessness&mdash;forgive me.
That book is a faithful picture of one world&mdash;but not your
world, thank God&mdash;nor any world you will ever be a citizen of.
Star, promise me you will forget that book.'</p>

<p>"'I'll forget it if I can,' I said.</p>

<p>"But I don't know if I can. It was so ugly. I have not been so
happy since I read it. I feel as if my hands were soiled somehow
and I couldn't wash them clean. And I have another queer feeling,
as if <i>some gate had been shut behind me,</i> shutting me into a
new world I don't quite understand or like, but through which I
must travel.</p>

<p>"To-night I tried to write a description of Dean in my
Jimmy-book of character sketches. But I didn't succeed. What I
wrote seemed like a photograph&mdash;not a portrait. There is
something in Dean that is beyond me.</p>

<p>"Dean took a picture of me the other day with his new camera,
but he wasn't pleased with it.</p>

<p>"'It doesn't look like you,' he said, 'but of course one can
never photograph starlight.'</p>

<p>"Then he added, quite sharply, I thought,</p>

<p>"'Tell that young imp of a Teddy Kent to keep your face out of
his pictures. He has no business to put <i>you</i> into every one
he draws.'</p>

<p>"'He doesn't!' I cried. 'Why, Teddy never made but the one
picture of me&mdash;the one Aunt Nancy <i>stole.'</i></p>

<p>"I said it quite viciously and unashamed, for I've never
forgiven Aunt Nancy for keeping that picture.</p>

<p>"'He's got <i>something</i> of you in every picture,' said Dean
stubbornly&mdash;'your eyes&mdash;the curve of your neck&mdash;the
tilt of your head&mdash;your personality. That's the worst&mdash;I
don't mind your eyes and curves so much, but I won't have that cub
putting a bit of your soul into everything he draws. Probably he
doesn't know he's doing it&mdash;which makes it all the worse.'</p>

<p>"'I don't understand you,' I said, <i>quite haughtily.</i> 'But
Teddy is <i>wonderful</i>&mdash;Mr. Carpenter says so.'</p>

<p>"'And Emily of New Moon echoes it! Oh, the kid has
talent&mdash;he'll do something some day if his morbid mother
doesn't ruin his life. But let him keep his pencil and brush off
<i>my</i> property.'</p>

<p>"Dean laughed as he said it. But I held my head high. I am not
anybody's 'property,' not even in fun. And I <i>never</i> will
be.</p>

<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

<p>"May 12, 19&mdash;</p>

<p>"Aunt Ruth and Uncle Wallace and Uncle Oliver were all here this
afternoon. I like Uncle Oliver, but I am not much fonder of Aunt
Ruth and Uncle Wallace than I ever was. They held some kind of
family conclave in the parlour with Aunt Elizabeth and Aunt Laura.
Cousin Jimmy was allowed in but I was excluded, although I feel
perfectly certain that it had something to do with me. I think Aunt
Ruth didn't get her own way, either, for she snubbed me continually
all through supper, and said I was growing weedy! Aunt Ruth
generally snubs me and Uncle Wallace patronizes me. I prefer Aunt
Ruth's snubs because I don't have to look as if I liked them. I
endured them to a certain point, and then the lid flew off. Aunt
Ruth said to me,</p>

<p>"'Em'ly, don't contradict,' just as she might have spoken to a
<i>mere child.</i> I looked her right in the eyes and said
<i>coldly,</i></p>

<p>"'Aunt Ruth, I think I am too old to be spoken to in that
fashion now.'</p>

<p>"'You are not too old to be very rude and impertinent,' said
Aunt Ruth, with a sniff, 'and if <i>I</i> were in Elizabeth's place
I would give you a sound box on the ear, Miss.'</p>

<p>"I hate to be Em'ly'd and Miss'd and sniffed at! It seems to me
that Aunt Ruth has <i>all</i> the Murray faults, and <i>none</i> of
their virtues.</p>

<p>"Uncle Oliver's son Andrew came with him and is going to stay
for a week. He is four years older than I am.</p>

<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

<p>"May 19, 19&mdash;</p>

<p>"This is my birthday. I am fourteen years old today. I wrote a
letter 'From myself at fourteen to myself at twenty-four,' sealed
it up and put it away in my cupboard, to be opened on my
twenty-fourth birthday. I made some predictions in it. I wonder if
they will have come to pass when I open it.</p>

<p>"Aunt Elizabeth gave me back all Father's books today. I was so
glad. It seems to me that a part of Father is in those books. His
name is in each one in his own handwriting, and the notes he made
on the margins. They seem like little bits of letters from him. I
have been looking over them all the evening, and Father seems so
<i>near</i> to me again, and I feel both happy and sad.</p>

<p>"One thing spoiled the day for me. In school, when I went up to
the blackboard to work a problem, everybody suddenly began to
titter. I could not imagine why. Then I discovered that some one
had pinned a sheet of foolscap to my back, on which was printed in
big, black letters: <i>'Emily Byrd Starr, Authoress of The
Four-Legged Duck.'</i> They laughed more than ever when I snatched
it off and threw it in the coal-scuttle. It infuriates me when
anyone ridicules my ambitions like that. I came home angry and
sore. But when I had sat on the steps of the summer-house and
looked at one of Cousin Jimmy's big purple pansies for five minutes
all my anger went away. Nobody can keep on being angry if she looks
into the heart of a pansy for a little while.</p>

<p>"Besides, <i>the time will come when they will not laugh at
me!</i></p>

<p>"Andrew went home yesterday. Aunt Elizabeth asked me how I liked
him. She never asked me how I liked anyone before&mdash;my likings
were not important enough. I suppose she is beginning to realize
that I am no <i>longer a child.</i></p>

<p>"I said I thought he was good and kind and stupid and
uninteresting.</p>

<p>"Aunt Elizabeth was so annoyed she would not speak to me the
whole evening. Why? I had to tell the truth. And Andrew
<i>is.</i></p>

<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

<p>"May 21, 19&mdash;</p>

<p>"Old Kelly was here to-day for the first time this spring, with
a load of shining new tins. He brought me a bag of candies as
usual&mdash;and teased me about getting married, also as usual. But
he seemed to have something on his mind, and when I went to the
dairy to get him the drink of milk he had asked for, he followed
me.</p>

<p>"'Gurrl dear,' he said mysteriously. 'I met Jarback Praste in
the lane. Does he be coming here much?'</p>

<p>"I cocked my head at the Murray angle.</p>

<p>"'If you mean Mr. Dean Priest,' I said, 'he comes often. He is a
particular friend of mine.'</p>

<p>"Old Kelly shook his head.</p>

<p>"'Gurrl dear&mdash;I warned ye&mdash;niver be after saying I
didn't warn ye. I towld ye the day I took ye to Praste Pond niver
to marry a Praste. Didn't I now?'</p>

<p>"'Mr. Kelly, you're too ridiculous,' I said&mdash;angry and yet
feeling it was absurd to be angry with Old Jock Kelly. 'I'm not
going to marry anybody. Mr. Priest is old enough to be my father,
and I am just a little girl he helps in her studies.'</p>

<p>"Old Kelly gave his head another shake.</p>

<p>"'I know the Prastes, gurrl dear&mdash;and when they do be after
setting their minds on a thing ye might as well try to turn the
wind. This Jarback now&mdash;they tell me he's had his eye on ye
iver since he fished ye up from the Malvern rocks&mdash;he's just
biding his time till ye get old enough for coorting. They tell me
he's an infidel, and it's well known that whin he was being
christened he rached up and clawed the spectacles off av the
minister. So what wud ye ixpect? I nadn't be telling ye he's lame
and crooked&mdash;ye can see that for yerself. Take foolish Ould
Kelly's advice and cut loose while there's time. Now, don't be
looking at me like the Murrays, gurrl dear. Shure, and it's for
your own good I do be spaking.'</p>

<p>"I walked off and left him. One <i>couldn't</i> argue with him
over such a thing. I <i>wish</i> people wouldn't put such ideas
into my mind. They stick there like burrs. I won't feel as
comfortable with Dean for weeks now, though I know perfectly well
every word Old Kelly said was nonsense.</p>

<p>"After Old Kelly went away I came up to my room and wrote a full
description of him in a Jimmy-book.</p>

<p>"Ilse has got a new hat trimmed with clouds of blue tulle, and
red cherries, with big blue tulle bows under the chin. I did not
like it and told her so. She was furious and said I was jealous and
hasn't spoken to me for two days. I thought it all over. I knew I
was not jealous, but I concluded I had made a mistake. I will never
again tell anyone a thing like that. It was true but it was not
tactful.</p>

<p>"I hope Ilse will have forgiven me by to-morrow. I miss her
horribly when she is offended with me. She's such a dear thing and
so jolly, and splendid, when she isn't vexed.</p>

<p>"Teddy is a little squiffy with me, too, just now. I
<i>think</i> it is because Geoff North walked home with me from
prayer-meeting last Wednesday night. I <i>hope</i> that is the
reason. I like to feel that I <i>have that much power</i> over
Teddy.</p>

<p>"I wonder if I ought to have written that down. But it's
<i>true.</i></p>

<p>"If Teddy only knew it, I have been very unhappy and ashamed
over that affair. At first, when Geoff singled me out from all the
girls, I was quite proud of it. It was the very first time I had
had an <i>escort home,</i> and Geoff is a town boy, <i>very
handsome and polished,</i> and all the older girls in Blair Water
are quite foolish about him. So I sailed away from the church door
with him, feeling as if I had grown up all at once. But we hadn't
gone far before I was hating him. He was so <i>condescending.</i>
He seemed to think I was a simple little country girl who must be
quite overwhelmed with the <i>honour</i> of his company.</p>

<p>"And that was true at first! <i>That</i> was what stung me. To
think I had been such a little fool!</p>

<p>"He kept saying, 'Really, you surprise me,' in an affected,
drawling kind of way, whenever I made a remark. And he <i>bored</i>
me. He couldn't talk sensibly about anything. Or else he wouldn't
try to with me. I was quite savage by the time we got to New Moon.
And then <i>that insufferable creature</i> asked me to kiss
him!</p>

<p>"I drew myself up&mdash;oh, I was Murray clear through at that
moment, all right. I <i>felt</i> I was looking exactly like Aunt
Elizabeth.</p>

<p>"'I do not kiss young men,' I said disdainfully.</p>

<p>"Geoff laughed and caught my hand.</p>

<p>"'Why, you little goose, what do you suppose I came home with
you for?' he said.</p>

<p>"I pulled my hand away from him, and walked into the house. But
before I did that, I did something else.</p>

<p><i>"I slapped his face!</i>
</p>

<p>"Then I came up to my room and cried with shame over being
insulted, and having been so undignified in resenting it. Dignity
is a tradition of New Moon, and I felt that I had been false to
it.</p>

<p>"But I think I 'surprised' Geoff North in right good
earnest!</p>

<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

<p>"May 24, 19&mdash;</p>

<p>"Jennie Strang told me to-day that Geoff North told her brother
that I was 'a regular spitfire' and he had had enough of me.</p>

<p>"Aunt Elizabeth has found out that Geoff came home with me, and
told me to-day that I would not be 'trusted' to go alone to
prayer-meeting again.</p>

<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

<p>"May 25, 19&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am sitting here in my room at twilight. The window is open
and the frogs are singing of something that happened very long ago.
All along the middle garden walk the Gay Folk are holding up great
fluted cups of ruby and gold and pearl. It is not raining now, but
it rained all day&mdash;a rain scented with lilacs. I like all
kinds of weather and I like rainy days&mdash;soft, misty, rainy
days when the Wind Woman just shakes the tops of the spruces
gently; and wild, tempestuous, streaming rainy days. I like being
shut in by the rain&mdash;I like to hear it thudding on the roof,
and beating on the panes and pouring off the eaves, while the Wind
Woman skirls like a mad old witch in the woods, and through the
garden.</p>

<p>"Still, if it rains when I want to go anywhere I growl just as
much as anybody!</p>

<p>"An evening like this always makes me think of that spring
Father died, three years ago, and that dear little, old house down
at Maywood. I've never been back since. I wonder if anyone is
living in it now. And if Adam-and-Eve and the Rooster Pine and the
Praying Tree are just the same. And who is sleeping in my old room
there, and if anyone is loving the little birches and playing with
the Wind Woman in the spruce barrens. Just as I wrote the words
'spruce barrens' an old memory came back to me. One spring evening,
when I was eight years old, I was running about the barrens playing
hide-and-seek with the Wind Woman, and I found a little hollow
between two spruces that was just carpeted with tiny, bright-green
leaves, when everything else was still brown and faded. They were
so beautiful that <i>the flash</i> came as I looked at
them&mdash;it was the very first time it ever came to me. I suppose
that is why I remember those little green leaves so distinctly. No
one else remembers them&mdash;perhaps no one else ever saw them. I
have forgotten other leaves, but I remember them every spring and
with each remembrance I feel again the wonder-moment they gave
me."</p>

<h2><a name="c03" id="c03"><i>In the Watches of the Night</i></a>
</h2>

<p>Some of us can recall the exact time in which we reached certain
milestones on life's road&mdash;the wonderful hour when we passed
from childhood to girlhood&mdash;the enchanted, beautiful&mdash;or
perhaps the shattering and horrible&mdash;hour when girlhood was
suddenly womanhood&mdash;the chilling hour when we faced the fact
that youth was definitely behind us&mdash;the peaceful, sorrowful
hour of the realization of age. Emily Starr never forgot the night
when she passed the first milestone, and left childhood behind her
for ever.</p>

<p>Every experience enriches life and the deeper such an
experience, the greater the richness it brings. That night of
horror and mystery and strange delight ripened her mind and heart
like the passage of years.</p>

<p>It was a night early in July. The day had been one of intense
heat. Aunt Elizabeth had suffered so much from it that she decided
she would not go to prayer-meeting. Aunt Laura and Cousin Jimmy and
Emily went. Before leaving Emily asked and obtained Aunt
Elizabeth's permission to go home with Ilse Burnley after meeting,
and spend the night. This was a rare treat. Aunt Elizabeth did not
approve of all-night absences as a general thing.</p>

<p>But Dr. Burnley had to be away, and his housekeeper was
temporarily laid up with a broken ankle. Ilse had asked Emily to
come over for the night, and Emily was to be permitted to go. Ilse
did not know this&mdash;hardly hoped for it, in fact&mdash;but was
to be informed at prayer-meeting. If Ilse had not been late Emily
would have told her before meeting "went in," and the mischances of
the night would probably have been averted; but Ilse, as usual,
<i>was</i> late, and everything else followed in course.</p>

<p>Emily sat in the Murray pew, near the top of the church by the
window that looked out into the grove of fir and maple that
surrounded the little white church. This prayer-meeting was not the
ordinary weekly sprinkling of a faithful few. It was a "special
meeting," held in view of the approaching communion Sunday, and the
speaker was not young, earnest Mr. Johnson, to whom Emily always
liked to listen, in spite of her blunder at the Ladies' Aid Supper
but an itinerant evangelist lent by Shrewsbury for one night. His
fame brought out a churchful of people, but most of the audience
declared afterwards that they would much rather have heard their
own Mr. Johnson. Emily looked at him with her level, critical gaze,
and decided that he was oily and unspiritual. She heard him through
a prayer, and thought,</p>

<p>"Giving God good advice, and abusing the devil isn't
praying."</p>

<p>She listened to his discourse for a few minutes and made up her
mind that he was blatant and illogical and sensational, and then
proceeded, coolly, to shut mind and ears to him and disappear into
dreamland&mdash;something which she could generally do at will when
anxious to escape from discordant realities.</p>

<p>Outside, moonlight was still sifting in a rain of silver through
the firs and maples, though an ominous bank of cloud was making up
in the north-west, and repeated rumblings of thunder came on the
silent air of the hot summer night&mdash;a windless night for the
most part, though occasionally a sudden breath that seemed more
like a sigh than a breeze brushed through the trees, and set their
shadows dancing in weird companies. There was something strange
about the night in its mingling of placid, accustomed beauty with
the omens of rising storm, that intrigued Emily, and she spent half
the time of the evangelist's address in composing a mental
description of it for her Jimmy-book. The rest of the time she
studied such of the audience as were within her range of
vision.</p>

<p>This was something that Emily never wearied of, in public
assemblages, and the older she grew the more she liked it. It was
fascinating to study those varied faces, and speculate on the
histories written in mysterious hieroglyphics over them. They had
all their inner, secret lives, those men and women, known to no one
but themselves and God. Others could only guess at them, and Emily
loved this game of guessing. At times it seemed veritably to her
that it was more than guessing&mdash;that in some intense moments
she could pass into their souls and read therein hidden motives and
passions that were, perhaps, a mystery even to their possessors. It
was never easy for Emily to resist the temptation to do this when
the power came, although she never yielded to it without an uneasy
feeling that she was committing trespass. It was quite a different
thing from soaring on the wings of fancy into an ideal world of
creation&mdash;quite different from the exquisite, unearthly beauty
of "the flash;" neither of these gave her any moments of pause or
doubt. But to slip on tiptoe through some momentarily unlatched
door, as it were, and catch a glimpse of masked, unuttered,
unutterable things in the hearts and souls of others, was something
that always brought, along with its sense of power, a sense of the
forbidden&mdash;a sense even of sacrilege. Yet Emily did not know
if she would ever be able to resist the allure of it&mdash;she had
always peered through the door and seen the things before she
realized that she was doing it. They were nearly always terrible
things. Secrets are generally terrible. Beauty is not often
hidden&mdash;only ugliness and deformity.</p>

<p>"Elder Forsyth would have been a persecutor in old times," she
thought. "He has the face of one. This very minute he is loving the
preacher because he is describing hell, and Elder Forsyth thinks
all his enemies will go there. Yes, that is why he is looking
pleased. I think Mrs. Bowes flies off on a broomstick o' nights.
She <i>looks</i> it. Four hundred years ago she would have been a
witch, and Elder Forsyth would have burned her at the stake. She
hates everybody&mdash;it must be terrible to hate
everybody&mdash;to have your soul full of hatred. I must try to
describe such a person in my Jimmy-book. I wonder if hate has
driven <i>all</i> love out of her soul, or if there is a little bit
left in it for any one or any thing. If there is it might save her.
That would be a good idea for a story. I must jot it down before I
go to bed&mdash;I'll borrow a bit of paper from Ilse.
No&mdash;here's a bit in my hymn-book. I'll write it now.</p>

<p>"I wonder what all these people would say if they were suddenly
asked what they wanted most, and <i>had</i> to answer truthfully. I
wonder how many of these husbands and wives would like a change?
Chris Farrar and Mrs. Chris would&mdash;everybody knows that. I
can't think why I feel so sure that James Beatty and <i>his</i>
wife would, too. They <i>seem</i> to be quite contented with each
other&mdash;but once I saw her look at him when she did not know
anyone was watching&mdash;oh, it seemed to me I saw right into her
soul, through her eyes, and she hated him&mdash;and feared him. She
is sitting there now, beside him, little and thin and dowdy, and
her face is grey and her hair is faded&mdash;but she, herself, is
one red flame of rebellion. What <i>she</i> wants most is to be
free from him&mdash;or just to <i>strike back once.</i> That would
satisfy her.</p>

<p>"There's Dean&mdash;I wonder what brought him to prayer-meeting?
His face is very solemn, but his eyes are mocking Mr.
Sampson&mdash;what's that Mr. Sampson's saying?&mdash;oh, something
about the wise virgins. I hate the wise virgins&mdash;I think they
were horribly selfish. They <i>might</i> have given the poor
foolish ones a little oil. I don't believe Jesus meant to praise
them any more than He meant to praise the unjust steward&mdash;I
think he was just trying to warn foolish people that they must not
<i>be</i> careless, and foolish, because if they were, prudent,
selfish folks would never help them out. I wonder if it's very
wicked to feel that I'd rather be outside with the foolish ones
trying to help and comfort them, than inside feasting with the wise
ones. It would be <i>more interesting,</i> too.</p>

<p>"There's Mrs. Kent and Teddy. Oh, <i>she</i> wants something
terribly&mdash;I don't know what it is but it's something she can
never get, and the hunger for it goads her night and day. That is
why she holds Teddy so closely&mdash;I know. But I don't know what
it is that makes her so different from other women. I can never get
a peep into <i>her</i> soul&mdash;she shuts every one out&mdash;the
door is never unlatched.</p>

<p>"What do <i>I</i> want most? It is to climb the Alpine Path to
the very top,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"And write upon its shining scroll<br>
A woman's humble name.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>"We're all hungry. We all want some bread of life&mdash;but Mr.
Sampson can't give it to us. I wonder what <i>he</i> wants most?
His soul is so muggy I can't see into it. He has a lot of sordid
wants&mdash;he doesn't want <i>anything</i> enough to dominate him.
Mr. Johnson wants to help people and preach truth&mdash;he really
does. And Aunt Janey wants most of all to see the whole heathen
world Christianized. Her soul hasn't any dark wishes in it. I know
what Mr. Carpenter wants&mdash;his one lost chance again. Katherine
Morris wants her youth back&mdash;she hates us younger girls
<i>because</i> we are young. Old Malcolm Strang just wants to
live&mdash;just one more year&mdash;always just one more
year&mdash;just to live&mdash;just not to die. It must be horrible
to have nothing to live for except just to escape dying. Yet he
believes in heaven&mdash;he thinks he will go there. If he could
see my flash just once he wouldn't hate the thought of dying so,
poor old man. And Mary Strang wants to die&mdash;before something
terrible she is afraid of tortures her to death. They say it's
cancer. There's Mad Mr. Morrison up in the gallery&mdash;we all
know what <i>he</i> wants&mdash;to find his Annie. Tom Sibley wants
the moon, I think&mdash;and knows he can never get it&mdash;that's
why people say he's not all there. Amy Crabbe wants Max Terry to
come back to her&mdash;nothing else matters to her.</p>

<p>"I must write all these things down in my Jimmy-book to-morrow.
They are fascinating&mdash;but, after all, I like writing of
beautiful things better. Only&mdash;these things have a <i>tang</i>
beautiful things don't have some way. Those woods out
there&mdash;how wonderful they are in their silver and shadow. The
moonlight is doing strange things to the tombstones&mdash;it makes
even the ugly ones beautiful. But it's terribly hot&mdash;it is
smothering here&mdash;and those thunder-growls are coming nearer. I
hope Ilse and I will get home before the storm breaks. Oh, Mr.
Sampson, Mr. Sampson, God isn't an angry God&mdash;you don't know
anything about Him if you say that&mdash;He's sorrowful, I'm sure,
when we're foolish and wicked, but He doesn't fly into tantrums.
Your God and Ellen Greene's God are exactly alike. I'd like to get
up and tell you so, but it isn't a Murray tradition to sass back in
church. You make God ugly&mdash;and He's beautiful. I hate you for
making God ugly, you fat little man."</p>

<p>Whereupon Mr. Sampson, who had several times noted Emily's
intent, probing gaze, and thought he was impressing her
tremendously with a sense of her unsaved condition, finished with a
final urgent whoop of entreaty, and sat down. The audience in the
close, oppressive atmosphere of the crowded, lamplit church gave an
audible sigh of relief, and scarcely waited for the hymn and
benediction before crowding out to purer air. Emily, caught in the
current, and parted from Aunt Laura, was swept out by way of the
choir door to the left of the pulpit. It was some time before she
could disentangle herself from the throng and hurry around to the
front where she expected to meet Ilse. Here was another dense,
though rapidly thinning crowd, in which she found no trace of Ilse.
Suddenly Emily noticed that she did not have her hymn-book. Hastily
she dashed back to the choir door. She must have left her hymn-book
in the pew&mdash;and it would never do to leave it there. In it she
had placed for safe-keeping a slip of paper on which she had
furtively jotted down some fragmentary notes during the last
hymn&mdash;a rather biting description of scrawny Miss Potter in
the choir&mdash;a couple of satiric sentences regarding Mr. Sampson
himself&mdash;and a few random fancies which she desired most of
all to hide because there was in them something of dream and vision
which would have made the reading of them by alien eyes a
sacrilege.</p>

<p>Old Jacob Banks, the sexton, a little blind and more than a
little deaf, was turning out the lamps as she went in. He had
reached the two on the wall behind the pulpit. Emily caught her
hymn-book from the rack&mdash;her slip of paper was not in it. By
the faint gleam of light, as Jacob Banks turned out the last lamp,
she saw it on the floor, under the seat of the pew in front. She
kneeled down and reached after it. As she did so Jacob went out and
locked the choir door. Emily did not notice his going&mdash;the
church was still faintly illuminated by the moon that as yet
outrode the rapidly climbing thunder-heads. That was not the right
slip of paper after all&mdash;<i>where</i> could it be?&mdash;oh,
here, at last. She caught it up and ran to the door which would not
open.</p>

<p>For the first time Emily realized that Jacob Banks had
gone&mdash;that she was alone in the church. She wasted time trying
to open the door&mdash;then in calling Mr. Banks. Finally she ran
down the aisle into the front porch. As she did so she heard the
last buggy turn gridingly at the gate and drive away: at the same
time the moon was suddenly swallowed up by the black clouds and the
church was engulfed in darkness&mdash;close, hot, smothering,
almost tangible darkness. Emily screamed in sudden panic&mdash;beat
on the door&mdash;frantically twisted the handle&mdash;screamed
again. Oh, everybody could not have gone&mdash;surely somebody
would hear her! "Aunt Laura"&mdash;"Cousin
Jimmy"&mdash;"Ilse"&mdash;then finally in a wail of
despair&mdash;"Oh, Teddy&mdash;Teddy!"</p>

<p>A blue-white stream of lightning swept the porch, followed by a
crash of thunder. One of the worst storms in Blair Water annals had
begun&mdash;and Emily Starr was locked alone in the dark church in
the maple woods&mdash;she, who had always been afraid of
thunderstorms with a reasonless, instinctive fear which she could
never banish and only partially control.</p>

<p>She sank, quivering, on a step of the gallery stairs, and
huddled there in a heap. Surely some one would come back when it
was discovered she was missing. But <i>would</i> it be discovered?
Who would miss her? Aunt Laura and Cousin Jimmy would suppose she
was with Ilse, as had been arranged. Ilse, who had evidently gone,
believing that Emily was not coming with her, would suppose she had
gone home to New Moon. Nobody knew where she was&mdash;nobody would
come back for her. She must stay here in this horrible, lonely,
black, echoing place&mdash;for now the church she knew so well and
loved for its old associations of Sunday-school and song and homely
faces of dear friends had become a ghostly, alien place full of
haunting terrors. There was no escape. The windows could not be
opened. The church was ventilated by transom-like panes near the
top of them, which were opened and shut by pulling a wire. She
could not get up to them, and she could not have got through them
if she had.</p>

<p>She cowered down on the step, shuddering from head to foot. By
now the thunder and lightning were almost incessant: rain blew
against the windows, not in drops but sheets, and intermittent
volleys of hail bombarded them. The wind had risen suddenly with
the storm and shrieked around the church. It was not her old dear
friend of childhood, the bat-winged, misty "Wind Woman," but a
legion of yelling witches. "The Prince of the Power of the Air
rules the wind," she had heard Mad Mr. Morrison say once. Why
should she think of Mad Mr. Morrison now? How the windows rattled
as if demon riders of the storm were shaking them! She had heard a
wild tale of some one hearing the organ play in the empty church
one night several years ago. <i>Suppose it began playing now!</i>
No fancy seemed too grotesque or horrible to come true. Didn't the
stairs creak? The blackness between the lightnings was so intense
that it looked <i>thick.</i> Emily was frightened of it touching
her and buried her face in her lap.</p>

<p>Presently, however, she got a grip on herself and began to
reflect that she was not living up to Murray traditions. Murrays
were not supposed to go to pieces like this. Murrays were not
foolishly panicky in thunder-storms. Those old Murrays sleeping in
the private graveyard across the pond would have scorned her as a
degenerate descendant. Aunt Elizabeth would have said that it was
the Starr coming out in her. She must be brave: after all, she had
lived through worse hours than this&mdash;the night she had eaten
of Lofty John's poisoned apple*&mdash;the afternoon she had fallen
over the rocks of Malvern Bay. This had come so suddenly on her
that she had been in the throes of terror before she could brace
herself against it. She <i>must</i> pick up. Nothing dreadful was
going to happen to her&mdash;nothing worse than staying all night
in the church. In the morning she could attract the attention of
some one passing. She had been here over an hour now, and nothing
had happened to her&mdash;unless indeed her hair had turned white,
as she understood hair sometimes did. There had been such a funny,
crinkly, crawly feeling at the roots of it at times. Emily held out
her long braid, ready for the next flash. When it came she saw that
her hair was still black. She sighed with relief and began to chirk
up. The storm was passing. The thunder-peals were growing fainter
and fewer, though the rain continued to fall and the wind to drive
and shriek around the church, whining through the big keyhole
eerily.</p>

<p>* See <i>Emily of New Moon.</i></p>

<p>Emily straightened her shoulders and cautiously let down her
feet to a lower step. She thought she had better try to get back
into the church. If another cloud came up, the steeple might be
struck&mdash;steeples were always getting struck, she remembered:
it might come crashing down on the, porch right over her. She would
go in and sit down in the Murray pew: she would be cool and
sensible and collected: she was ashamed of her panic&mdash;but it
<i>had</i> been terrible.</p>

<p>All around her now was a soft, heavy darkness, still with that
same eerie sensation of something you could touch, born perhaps of
the heat and humidity of the July night. The porch was so small and
narrow&mdash;she would not feel so smothered and oppressed in the
church.</p>

<p>She put out her hand to grasp a stair rail and pull herself to
her cramped feet. Her hand touched&mdash;not the stair
rail&mdash;merciful heavens, what was it?&mdash;something
<i>hairy&mdash;</i>Emily's shriek of horror froze on her
lips&mdash;padding footsteps passed down the steps beside her; a
flash of lightning came and at the bottom of the steps was a huge
black dog, which had turned and was looking up at her before he was
blotted out in the returning darkness. Even then for a moment she
saw his eyes blazing redly at her, like a fiend's.</p>

<p>Emily's hair roots began to crawl and crinkle again&mdash;a very
large, very cold caterpillar began to creep slowly up her spine.
She could not have moved a muscle had life depended on it. She
could not even cry out. The only thing she could think of at first
was the horrible demon hound of the Manx Castle in <i>Peveril of
the Peak.</i> For a few minutes her terror was so great that it
turned her physically sick. Then, with an effort which was
unchild-like in its determination&mdash;I think it was at that
moment Emily wholly ceased to be a child&mdash;she recovered her
self-control. She <i>would not</i> yield to fear&mdash;she set her
teeth and clenched her trembling hands; she <i>would</i> be
brave&mdash;sensible. That was only a commonplace Blair Water dog
which had followed its owner&mdash;some rapscallion boy&mdash;into
the gallery, and got itself left behind. The thing had happened
before. A flash of lightning showed her that the porch was empty.
Evidently the dog had gone into the church. Emily decided that she
would stay where she was. She had recovered from her panic, but she
did not want to feel the sudden touch of a cold nose or a hairy
flank in the darkness. She could never forget the awfulness of the
moment when she <i>had</i> touched the creature.</p>

<p>It must be all of twelve o'clock now&mdash;it had been ten when
the meeting came out. The noise of the storm had for the most part
died away. The drive and shriek of the wind came occasionally, but
between its gusts there was a silence, broken only by the
diminishing raindrops. Thunder still muttered faintly and lightning
came at frequent intervals, but of a paler, gentler flame&mdash;not
the rending glare that had seemed to wrap the very building in
intolerable blue radiance, and scorch her eye. Gradually her heart
began to beat normally. The power of rational thought returned. She
did not like her predicament, but she began to find dramatic
possibilities in it. Oh, what a chapter for her diary&mdash;or her
Jimmy-book&mdash;and, beyond it, for that novel she would write
some day! It was a situation expressly shaped for the
heroine&mdash;who must, of course, be rescued by the hero. Emily
began constructing the scene&mdash;adding to it&mdash;intensifying
it&mdash;hunting for words to express it. This was
rather&mdash;interesting&mdash;after all. Only she wished she knew
just where the dog was. How weirdly the pale lightning gleamed on
the gravestones which she could see through the porch window
opposite her! How strange the familiar valley beyond looked in the
recurrent illuminations! How the wind moaned and sighed and
complained&mdash;but it was her own Wind Woman again. The Wind
Woman was one of her childish fancies that she had carried over
into maturity, and it comforted her now, with a sense of ancient
companionship. The wild riders of the storm were gone&mdash;her
fairy friend had come back. Emily gave a sigh that was almost of
contentment. The worst was over&mdash;and really, hadn't she
behaved pretty well? She began to feel quite self-respecting
again.</p>

<p>All at once Emily knew she was not alone!</p>

<p>How she knew it she could not have told. She had heard
nothing&mdash;seen nothing&mdash;felt nothing: and yet she knew,
beyond all doubt or dispute, that there was a Presence in the
darkness above her on the stairs.</p>

<p>She turned and looked up. It was horrible to look, but it was
less horrible to feel that&mdash;Something&mdash;was in front of
you than that it was behind you. She stared with wildly dilated
eyes into the darkness, but she could see nothing. Then&mdash;she
heard a low laugh above her&mdash;a laugh that almost made her
heart stop beating&mdash;the very dreadful, inhuman laughter of the
unsound in mind. She did not need the lightning flash that came
then to tell her that Mad Mr. Morrison was somewhere on the stairs
above her. But it came&mdash;she saw him&mdash;she felt as if she
were sinking in some icy gulf of coldness&mdash;she could not even
scream.</p>

<p>The picture of him, etched on her brain by the lightning, never
left her. He was crouched five steps above her, with his gray head
thrust forward. She saw the frenzied gleam of his eyes&mdash;the
fang-like yellow teeth exposed in a horrible smile&mdash;the long,
thin, blood-red hand outstretched towards her, almost touching her
shoulder.</p>

<p>Sheer panic shattered Emily's trance. She bounded to her feet
with a piercing scream of terror.</p>

<p>"Teddy! Teddy! Save me!" she shrieked madly.</p>

<p>She did not know why she called for Teddy&mdash;she did not even
realize that she <i>had</i> called him&mdash;she only remembered it
afterwards, as one might recall the waking shriek in a
nightmare&mdash;she only knew that she <i>must</i> have
help&mdash;that she would die if that awful hand touched her. <i>It
must not touch her.</i></p>

<p>She made a mad spring down the steps, rushed into the church,
and up the aisle. She must hide before the next flash
came&mdash;but not in the Murray pew. He might look for her there.
She dived into one of the middle pews and crouched down in its
corner on the floor. Her body was bathed in an ice-cold
perspiration. She was wholly in the grip of uncontrollable terror.
All she could think of was that it must not touch her&mdash;that
blood-red hand of the mad old man.</p>

<p>Moments passed that seemed like years. Presently she heard
footsteps&mdash;footsteps that came and went yet seemed to approach
her slowly. Suddenly she knew what he was doing. He was going into
every pew, not waiting for the lightning, to feel about for her. He
<i>was</i> looking for her, then&mdash;she had heard that sometimes
he followed young girls, thinking they were Annie. If he caught
them he held them with one hand and stroked their hair and faces
fondly with the other, mumbling foolish, senile endearments. He had
never harmed anyone, but he had never let anyone go until she was
rescued by some other person. It was said that Mary Paxton of Derry
Pond had never been quite the same again; her nerves never
recovered from the shock.</p>

<p>Emily knew that it was only a question of time before he would
reach the pew where she crouched&mdash;feeling about with those
hands! All that kept her senses in her frozen body was the thought
that if she lost consciousness those hands would touch
her&mdash;hold her&mdash;caress her. The next lightning flash
showed him entering the adjoining pew. Emily sprang up and out and
rushed to the other side of the church. She hid again: he would
search her out, but she could again elude him: this might go on all
night: a madman's strength would outlast hers: at last she might
fall exhausted and he would pounce on her.</p>

<p>For what seemed hours to Emily, this mad game of hide-and-seek
lasted. It was in reality about half an hour. She was hardly a
rational creature at all, any more than her demented pursuer. She
was merely a crouching, springing, shrieking thing of horror. Time
after time he hunted her out with his cunning, implacable patience.
The last time she was near one of the porch doors, and in
desperation she sprang through it and slammed it in his face. With
the last ounce of her strength she tried to hold the knob from
turning in his grasp. And as she strove she heard&mdash;was she
dreaming?&mdash;Teddy's voice calling to her from the steps outside
the outer door.</p>

<p>"Emily&mdash;Emily&mdash;are you there?"</p>

<p>She did not know how he had come&mdash;she did not
wonder&mdash;she only knew he <i>was</i> there!</p>

<p>"Teddy, I'm locked in the church!" she shrieked&mdash;"and Mad
Mr. Morrison is here&mdash;oh&mdash;quick&mdash;quick&mdash;save
me&mdash;save me!"</p>

<p>"The key of the door is hanging up in there on a nail at the
right side!" shouted Teddy. "Can you get it and unlock the door? If
you can't I'll smash the porch window."</p>

<p>The clouds broke at that moment and the porch was filled with
moonlight. In it she saw plainly the big key, hanging high on the
wall beside the front door. She dashed at it and caught it as Mad
Mr. Morrison wrenched upon the door and sprang into the porch, his
dog behind him. Emily unlocked the outer door and stumbled out into
Teddy's arms just in time to elude that outstretched, blood-red
hand. She heard Mad Mr. Morrison give a wild, eerie shriek of
despair as she escaped him.</p>

<p>Sobbing, shaking, she clung to Teddy.</p>

<p>"Oh, Teddy, take me away&mdash;take me quick&mdash;oh, don't let
him touch me, Teddy&mdash;don't let him touch me!"</p>

<p>Teddy swung her behind him and faced Mad Mr. Morrison on the
stone step.</p>

<p>"How dare you frighten her so?" he demanded angrily.</p>

<p>Mad Mr. Morrison smiled deprecatingly in the moonlight. All at
once he was not wild or violent&mdash;only a heart-broken old man
who sought his own.</p>

<p>"I want Annie," he mumbled. "Where is Annie? I thought I had
found her in there. I only wanted to find my beautiful Annie."</p>

<p>"Annie isn't here," said Teddy, tightening his hold on Emily's
cold little hand.</p>

<p>"Can you tell me where Annie is?" entreated Mad Mr. Morrison,
wistfully. "Can you tell me where my dark-haired Annie is?"</p>

<p>Teddy was furious with Mad Mr. Morrison for frightening Emily,
but the old man's piteous entreaty touched him&mdash;and the artist
in him responded to the values of the picture presented against the
background of the white, moonlit church. He thought he would like
to paint Mad Mr. Morrison as he stood there, tall and gaunt, in his
gray "duster" coat, with his long white hair and beard, and the
ageless quest in his hollow, sunken eyes.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;no&mdash;I don't know where she is," he said gently,
"but I think you will find her sometime."</p>

<p>Mad Mr. Morrison sighed.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. Sometime I will overtake her. Come, my dog, we will
seek her."</p>

<p>Followed by his old black dog he went down the steps, across the
green and down the long, wet, tree-shadowed road. So going, he
passed out of Emily's life. She never saw Mad Mr. Morrison again.
But she looked after him understandingly, and forgave him. To
himself he was not the repulsive old man he seemed to her; he was a
gallant young lover seeking his lost and lovely bride. The pitiful
beauty of his quest intrigued her, even in the shaking reaction
from her hour of agony.</p>

<p>"Poor Mr. Morrison," she sobbed, as Teddy half led, half carried
her to one of the old flat gravestones at the side of the
church.</p>

<p>They sat there until Emily recovered composure and managed to
tell her tale&mdash;or the outlines of it. She felt she could never
tell&mdash;perhaps not even write in a Jimmy-book&mdash;the whole
of its racking horror. <i>That</i> was beyond words.</p>

<p>"And to think," she sobbed, "that the key was there all the
time. I never knew it."</p>

<p>"Old Jacob Banks always locks the front door with its big key on
the inside, and then hangs it up on that nail," said Teddy. "He
locks the choir door with a little key, which he takes home. He has
always done that since the time, three years ago, when he lost the
big key and was weeks before he found it."</p>

<p>Suddenly Emily awoke to the strangeness of Teddy's coming.</p>

<p>"How did you happen to come, Teddy?"</p>

<p>"Why, I heard you call me," he said. "You did call me, didn't
you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Emily, slowly, "I called for you when I saw Mad Mr.
Morrison first. But, Teddy, you couldn't have heard me&mdash;you
<i>couldn't.</i> The Tansy Patch is a mile from here."</p>

<p>"I <i>did</i> hear you," said Teddy, stubbornly. "I was asleep
and it woke me up. You called 'Teddy, Teddy, save me'&mdash;it was
your voice as plain as I ever heard it in my life. I got right up
and hurried on my clothes and came here as fast as I could."</p>

<p>"How did you know I was here?"</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;I don't know," said Teddy confusedly. "I didn't stop
to think&mdash;I just seemed to <i>know</i> you were in the church
when I heard you calling me, and I must get here as quick as I
could. It's&mdash;it's all&mdash;funny," he concluded lamely.</p>

<p>"It's&mdash;it's&mdash;it frightens me a little." Emily
shivered. "Aunt Elizabeth says I have second sight&mdash;you
remember Ilse's mother? Mr. Carpenter says I'm psychic&mdash;I
don't know just what that means, but think I'd rather not be
it."</p>

<p>She shivered again. Teddy thought she was cold and, having
nothing else to put around her, put his arm&mdash;somewhat
tentatively, since Murray pride and Murray dignity might be
outraged. Emily was not cold in body, but a little chill had blown
over her soul. Something supernatural&mdash;some mystery she could
not understand&mdash;had brushed too near her in that strange
summoning. Involuntarily she nestled a little closer to Teddy,
acutely conscious of the boyish tenderness she sensed behind the
aloofness of his boyish shyness. Suddenly she knew that she liked
Teddy better than anybody&mdash;better even than Aunt Laura or Ilse
or Dean.</p>

<p>Teddy's arm tightened a little.</p>

<p>"Anyhow, I'm glad I got here in time," he said. "If I hadn't
that crazy old man might have frightened you to death."</p>

<p>They sat so for a few minutes in silence. Everything seemed very
wonderful and beautiful&mdash;and a little unreal. Emily thought
she must be in a dream, or in one of her own wonder tales. The
storm had passed, and the moon was shining clearly once more. The
cool fresh air was threaded with beguiling voices&mdash;the fitful
voice of raindrops falling from the shaken boughs of the maple
woods behind them&mdash;the freakish voice of the Wind Woman around
the white church&mdash;the far-off, intriguing voice of the
sea&mdash;and, still finer and rarer, the little, remote, detached
voices of the night. Emily heard them all, more with the ears of
her soul than of her body, it seemed, as she had never heard them
before. Beyond were fields and groves and roads, pleasantly
suggestive and elusive, as if brooding over elfish secrets in the
moonlight. Silver-white daisies were nodding and swaying all over
the graveyard above graves remembered and graves forgotten. An owl
laughed delightfully to itself in the old pine. At the magical
sound Emily's mystic flash swept over her, swaying her like a
strong wind. She felt as if she and Teddy were all alone in a
wonderful new world, created for themselves only out of youth and
mystery and delight. They seemed, themselves, to be part of the
faint, cool fragrance of the night, of the owl's laughter, of the
daisies blowing in the shadowy air.</p>

<p>As for Teddy, he was thinking that Emily looked very sweet in
the pale moonshine, with her fringed, mysterious eyes and the
little dark love-curls clinging to her ivory neck. He tightened his
arm a little more&mdash;and still Murray pride and Murray dignity
made not a particle of protest.</p>

<p>"Emily," whispered Teddy, "you're the sweetest girl in the
world."</p>

<p>The words have been said so often by so many millions of lads to
so many millions of lasses, that they ought to be worn to tatters.
But when you hear them for the first time, in some magic hour of
your teens, they are as new and fresh and wondrous as if they had
just drifted over the hedges of Eden. Madam, whoever you are, and
however old you are, be honest, and admit that the first time you
heard those words on the lips of some shy sweetheart, was the great
moment of your life. Emily thrilled, from the crown of her head to
the toes of her slippered feet, with a sensation of hitherto
unknown and almost terrifying sweetness&mdash;a sensation that was
to sense what her "flash" was to spirit. It is quite conceivable
and not totally reprehensible that the next thing that happened
might have been a kiss. Emily thought Teddy was going to kiss her:
Teddy knew he was: and the odds are that he wouldn't have had his
face slapped as Geoff North had had.</p>

<p>But it was not to be. A shadow that had slipped in at the gate
and drifted across the wet grass, halted beside them, and touched
Teddy's shoulder, just as he bent his glossy black head. He looked
up, startled. Emily looked up. Mrs. Kent was standing there,
bareheaded, her scarred face clear in the moonlight, looking at
them tragically.</p>

<p>Emily and Teddy both stood up so suddenly that they seemed
veritably to have been jerked to their feet. Emily's fairy world
vanished like a dissolving bubble. She was in a different world
altogether&mdash;an absurd, ridiculous one. Yes, ridiculous.
Everything had suddenly become ridiculous. <i>Could</i> anything be
more ridiculous than to be caught here with Teddy, <i>by his
mother,</i> at two o'clock at night&mdash;what was that horrid word
she had lately heard for the first time?&mdash;oh, yes,
<i>spooning</i>&mdash;that was it&mdash;spooning on George Horton's
eighty-year-old tombstone? That was how other people would look at
it. How could a thing be so beautiful one moment and so absurd the
next? She was one horrible scorch of shame from head to feet. And
Teddy&mdash;she knew Teddy was feeling like a fool.</p>

<p>To Mrs. Kent it was not ridiculous&mdash;it was dreadful. To her
abnormal jealousy the incident had the most sinister significance.
She looked at Emily with her hollow, hungry eyes.</p>

<p>"So you are trying to steal my son from me," she said. "He is
all I have and you are trying to steal him."</p>

<p>"Oh, Mother, for goodness' sake, be sensible!" muttered
Teddy.</p>

<p>"He&mdash;he tells me to be sensible," Mrs. Kent echoed
tragically to the moon. "Sensible!"</p>

<p>"Yes, sensible," said Teddy angrily. "There's nothing to make
such a fuss about. Emily was locked in the church by accident and
Mad Mr. Morrison was there, too, and nearly frightened her to
death. I came to let her out and we were sitting here for a few
minutes until she got over her fright and was able to walk home.
That's all."</p>

<p>"How did you know she was here?" demanded Mrs. Kent.</p>

<p>How indeed! This was a hard question to answer. The truth
sounded like a silly, stupid invention. Nevertheless, Teddy told
it.</p>

<p>"She called me," he said bluntly.</p>

<p>"And you heard her&mdash;a mile away. Do you expect me to
believe that?" said Mrs. Kent, laughing wildly.</p>

<p>Emily had by this time recovered her poise. At no time in her
life was Emily Byrd Starr ever disconcerted for long. She drew
herself up proudly and in the dim light, in spite of her Starr
features, she looked much as Elizabeth Murray must have looked
thirty years before.</p>

<p>"Whether you believe it or not it is true, Mrs. Kent," she said
haughtily. "I am not stealing your son&mdash;I do not want
him&mdash;he can go."</p>

<p>"I'm going to take you home first, Emily," said Teddy. He folded
his arms and threw back his head and tried to look as stately as
Emily. He felt that he was a dismal failure at it, but it imposed
on Mrs. Kent. She began to cry.</p>

<p>"Go&mdash;go," she said. "Go to her&mdash;desert me."</p>

<p>Emily was thoroughly angry now. If this irrational woman
persisted in making a scene, very well: a scene she should
have.</p>

<p>"I won't let him take me home," she said, freezingly. "Teddy, go
with your mother."</p>

<p>"Oh, you command him, do you? He must do as you tell him, must
he?" cried Mrs. Kent, who now seemed to lose all control of
herself. Her tiny form was shaken with violent sobs. She wrung her
hands.</p>

<p>"He shall choose for himself," she cried. "He shall go with
you&mdash;or come with me. Choose, Teddy, for yourself. You shall
not do her bidding. Choose!"</p>

<p>She was fiercely dramatic again, as she lifted her hand and
pointed it at poor Teddy.</p>

<p>Teddy was feeling as miserable and impotently angry as any male
creature does when two women are quarrelling about him in his
presence. He wished himself a thousand miles away. What a mess to
be in&mdash;and to be made ridiculous like this before Emily! Why
on earth couldn't his mother behave like other boys' mothers? Why
must she be so intense and exacting? He knew Blair Water gossip
said she was "a little touched." He did not believe that.
But&mdash;but&mdash;well, in short here <i>was</i> a mess. You came
back to that every time. What on earth was he to do? If he took
Emily home he knew his mother would cry and pray for days. On the
other hand to desert Emily after her dreadful experience in the
church, and leave her to traverse that lonely road alone was
unthinkable. But Emily now dominated the situation. She was very
angry, with the icy anger of old Hugh Murray that did not dissipate
itself in idle bluster, but went straight to the point.</p>

<p>"You are a foolish, selfish woman," she said, "and you will make
your son hate you."</p>

<p>"Selfish! You call me selfish," sobbed Mrs. Kent. "I live only
for Teddy&mdash;he is all I have to live for."</p>

<p>"You <i>are</i> selfish." Emily was standing straight: her eyes
had gone black: her voice was cutting: "the Murray look" was on her
face, and in the pale moonlight it was a rather fearsome thing. She
wondered, as she spoke, how she knew certain things. But she
<i>did</i> know them. "You think you love him&mdash;it is only
yourself you love. You are determined to spoil his life. You won't
let him go to Shrewsbury because it will hurt you to let him go
away from you. You have let your jealousy of everything he cares
for eat your heart out, and master you. You won't bear a little
pain for his sake. You are not a mother at all. Teddy has a great
talent&mdash;every one says so. You ought to be proud of
him&mdash;you ought to give him his chance. But you won't&mdash;and
some day he will hate you for it&mdash;yes, he will."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no," moaned Mrs. Kent. She held up her hands as if to
ward off a blow and shrank back against Teddy. "Oh, you are
cruel&mdash;cruel. You don't know what I've suffered&mdash;you
don't know what ache is always at my heart. He is all I
have&mdash;all. I have nothing else&mdash;not even a memory. You
don't understand. I can't&mdash;I can't give him up."</p>

<p>"If you let your jealousy ruin his life you will lose him," said
Emily inexorably. She had always been afraid of Mrs. Kent. Now she
was suddenly no longer afraid of her&mdash;she knew she would never
be afraid of her again. "You hate everything he cares for&mdash;you
hate his friends and his dog and his drawing. You know you do. But
you can't keep him that way, Mrs. Kent. And you will find out when
it is too late. Good night, Teddy. Thank you again for coming to my
rescue. Good night, Mrs. Kent."</p>

<p>Emily's good night was very final. She turned and stalked across
the green without another glance, holding her head high. Down the
wet road she marched&mdash;at first very angry&mdash;then, as anger
ebbed, very tired&mdash;oh, horribly tired. She discovered that she
was fairly shaking with weariness. The emotions of the night had
exhausted her, and now&mdash;what to do? She did not like the idea
of going home to New Moon. Emily felt that she could never face
outraged Aunt Elizabeth if the various scandalous doings of this
night should be discovered. She turned in at the gate of Dr.
Burnley's house. His doors were never locked. Emily slipped into
the front hall as the dawn began to whiten in the sky and curled up
on the lounge behind the staircase. There was no use in waking
Ilse. She would tell her the whole story in the morning and bind
her to secrecy&mdash;all, at least, except one thing Teddy had
said, and the episode of Mrs. Kent. One was too beautiful, and the
other too disagreeable to be talked about. Of course, Mrs. Kent
wasn't like other women and there was no use in feeling too badly
about it. Nevertheless, she had wrecked and spoiled a frail,
beautiful something&mdash;she had blotched with absurdity a moment
that should have been eternally lovely. And she had, of course,
made poor Teddy feel like an ass. <i>That,</i> in the last
analysis, was what Emily really could not forgive.</p>

<p>As she drifted off to sleep she recalled drowsily the events of
that bewildering night&mdash;her imprisonment in the lonely
church&mdash;the horror of touching the dog&mdash;the worse horror
of Mad Mr. Morrison's pursuit&mdash;her rapture of relief at
Teddy's voice&mdash;the brief little moonlit idyll in the
graveyard&mdash;of all places for an idyll!&mdash;the tragi-comic
advent of poor morbid, jealous Mrs. Kent.</p>

<p>"I hope I wasn't too hard on her," thought Emily as she drifted
into slumber. "If I was I'm sorry. I'll have to write it down as a
bad deed in my diary. I feel somehow as if I'd grown up all at once
tonight&mdash;yesterday seems years away. But what a chapter it
will make for my diary. I'll write it all down&mdash;all but
Teddy's saying I was the sweetest girl in the world. <i>That's</i>
too&mdash;dear&mdash;to write.
I'll&mdash;just&mdash;<i>remember</i> it."</p>

<h2><a name="c04" id="c04"><i>"As Ithers See Us"</i></a>
</h2>

<p>Emily had finished mopping up the kitchen floor at New Moon and
was absorbed in sanding it in the beautiful and complicated
"herring-bone pattern" which was one of the New Moon traditions,
having been invented, so it was said, by great-great-grandmother of
"Here I stay" fame. Aunt Laura had taught Emily how to do it and
Emily was proud of her skill. Even Aunt Elizabeth had condescended
to say that Emily sanded the famous pattern very well, and when
Aunt Elizabeth praised, further comment was superfluous. New Moon
was the only place in Blair Water where the old custom of sanding
the floor was kept up; other housewives had long ago begun to use
"new-fangled" devices and patent cleaners for making their floors
white. But Dame Elizabeth Murray would none of such; as long as she
reigned at New Moon so long should candles burn and sanded floors
gleam whitely. Aunt Elizabeth had exasperated Emily somewhat by
insisting that the latter should put on Aunt Laura's old "Mother
Hubbard" while she was scrubbing the floor. A "Mother Hubbard," it
may be necessary to explain to those of this generation, was a
loose and shapeless garment which served principally as a sort of
morning gown and was liked in its day because it was cool and
easily put on. Aunt Elizabeth, it is quite unnecessary to say,
disapproved entirely of Mother Hubbards. She considered them the
last word in slovenliness, and Laura was never permitted to have
another one. But the old one, though its original pretty lilac tint
had faded to a dingy white, was still too "good" to be banished to
the rag bag; and it was this which Emily had been told to put
on.</p>

<p>Emily detested Mother Hubbards as heartily as Aunt Elizabeth
herself did. They were worse, she considered, even than the hated
"baby aprons" of her first summer at New Moon. She knew she looked
ridiculous in Aunt Laura's Mother Hubbard, which came to her feet,
and hung in loose, unbeautiful lines from her thin young shoulders;
and Emily had a horror of being "ridiculous." She had once shocked
Aunt Elizabeth by coolly telling her that she would "rather be bad
than ridiculous." Emily had scrubbed and sanded with one eye on the
door, ready to run if any stranger loomed up while she had on that
hideous wrapper.</p>

<p>It was not, as Emily very well knew, a Murray tradition to
"run." At New Moon you stood your ground, no matter what you had
on&mdash;the presupposition being that you were always neatly and
properly habited for the occupation of the moment. Emily recognized
the propriety of this, yet was, nevertheless, foolish and young
enough to feel that she would die of shame if seen by anyone in
Aunt Laura's Mother Hubbard. It was neat&mdash;it was
clean&mdash;but it was "ridiculous." There you were!</p>

<p>Just as Emily finished sanding and turned to place her can of
sand in the niche under the kitchen mantel, where it had been kept
from time immemorial, she heard strange voices in the kitchen yard.
A hasty glimpse through the window revealed to her the owners of
the voices&mdash;Miss Beulah Potter, and Mrs. Ann Cyrilla Potter,
calling, no doubt, in regard to the projected Ladies' Aid Social.
They were coming to the back door as was the Blair Water custom
when running in to see your neighbours, informally or on business;
they were already past the gay platoons of hollyhocks with which
Cousin Jimmy had flanked the stone path to the dairy, and of all
the people in Blair Water and out of it they were the two whom
Emily would least want to see her in any ridiculous plight
whatever. Without stopping to think, she darted into the boot
closet and shut the door.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ann Cyrilla knocked twice at the kitchen door, but Emily
did not budge. She knew Aunt Laura was weaving in the
garret&mdash;she could hear the dull thud of the treadles
overhead&mdash;but she thought Aunt Elizabeth was concocting pies
in the cook-house and would see or hear the callers. She would take
them into the sitting-room and then Emily could make her escape.
And on one thing she was determined&mdash;they should not see her
in that Mother Hubbard. Miss Potter was a thin, venomous,
acidulated gossip who seemed to dislike everybody in general and
Emily in particular; and Mrs. Ann Cyrilla was a plump, pretty,
smooth, amiable gossip who, by very reason of her smoothness and
amiability, did more real harm in a week than Miss Potter did in a
year. Emily distrusted her even while she could not help liking
her. She had so often heard Mrs. Ann Cyrilla make smiling fun of
people, to whose "faces" she had been very sweet and charming, and
Mrs. Ann Cyrilla, who had been one of the "dressy Wallaces" from
Derry Pond, was especially fond of laughing over the peculiarities
of other people's clothes.</p>

<p>Again the knock came&mdash;Miss Potter's this time, as Emily
knew by the staccato raps. They were getting impatient. Well, they
might knock there till the cows come home, vowed Emily. She would
not go to the door in the Mother Hubbard. Then she heard Perry's
voice outside explaining that Miss Elizabeth was away in the stumps
behind the barn picking raspberries, but that he would go and get
her if they would walk in and make themselves at home. To Emily's
despair, this was just what they did. Miss Potter sat down with a
creak and Mrs. Ann Cyrilla with a puff, and Perry's retreating
footsteps died away in the yard. Emily realized that she was by way
of being in a plight. It was very hot and stuffy in the tiny boot
closet&mdash;where Cousin Jimmy's working clothes were kept as well
as boots. She hoped earnestly that Perry would not be long in
finding Aunt Elizabeth.</p>

<p>"My, but it's awful hot," said Mrs. Ann Cyrilla, with a large
groan.</p>

<p>Poor Emily&mdash;no, no, we must not call her poor Emily; she
does not deserve pity&mdash;she has been very silly and is served
exactly right; Emily, then, already violently perspiring in her
close quarters, agreed wholly with her.</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> don't feel the heat as fat people do," said Miss
Potter. "I hope Elizabeth won't keep us waiting long. Laura's
weaving&mdash;I hear the loom going in the garret. But there would
be no use in seeing her&mdash;Elizabeth would override anything
Laura might promise, just because it wasn't <i>her</i> arrangement.
I see somebody has just finished sanding the floor. Look at those
worn boards, will you? You'd think Elizabeth Murray would have a
new floor laid down; but she is too mean, of course. Look at that
row of candles on the chimney-piece&mdash;all that trouble and poor
light because of the little extra coal-oil would cost. Well, she
can't take her money with her&mdash;she'll have to leave it all
behind at the golden gate even if she <i>is</i> a Murray."</p>

<p>Emily experienced a shock. She realized that not only was she
being half suffocated in the boot closet, but that she was an
eavesdropper&mdash;something she had never been since the evening
at Maywood when she had hidden under the table to hear her aunts
and uncles discussing her fate. To be sure, that had been
voluntary, while this was compulsory&mdash;at least, the Mother
Hubbard had made it compulsory. But that would not make Miss
Potter's comments any pleasanter to hear. What business had she to
call Aunt Elizabeth mean? Aunt Elizabeth <i>wasn't</i> mean. Emily
was suddenly very angry with Miss Potter. She, herself, often
criticized Aunt Elizabeth in secret, but it was intolerable that an
outsider should do it. And that little sneer at the Murrays! Emily
could imagine the shrewish glint in Miss Potter's eye as she
uttered it. As for the candles&mdash;</p>

<p>"The Murrays can see farther by candle-light than <i>you</i> can
by sunlight, Miss Potter," thought Emily disdainfully&mdash;or at
least as disdainfully as it is possible to think when a river of
perspiration is running down your back, and you have nothing to
breathe but the aroma of old leather.</p>

<p>"I suppose it's because of the expense that she won't send Emily
to school any longer than this year," said Mrs. Ann Cyrilla. "Most
folks think she ought to give her a year at Shrewsbury,
anyhow&mdash;you'd think she would for pride's sake, if nothing
else. But I am told she has decided against it."</p>

<p>Emily's heart sank. She hadn't been quite sure till now that
Aunt Elizabeth wouldn't send her to Shrewsbury. The tears sprang to
her eyes&mdash;burning, stinging tears of disappointment.</p>

<p>"Emily ought to be taught something to earn a living by," said
Miss Potter. "Her father left nothing."</p>

<p>"He left <i>me,"</i> said Emily below her breath, clenching her
fists. Anger dried up her tears.</p>

<p>"Oh," said Mrs. Ann Cyrilla, laughing with tolerant derision, "I
hear that Emily is going to make a living by writing
stories&mdash;not only a living but a fortune, I believe."</p>

<p>She laughed again. The idea was so exquisitely ridiculous. Mrs.
Ann Cyrilla hadn't heard anything so funny for a long time.</p>

<p>"They say she wastes half her time scribbling trash," agreed
Miss Potter. "If I was her Aunt Elizabeth I would soon cure her of
that nonsense."</p>

<p>"You mightn't find it so easy. I understand she has always been
a difficult girl to manage&mdash;so very pig-headed, Murray-like.
The whole clamjamfry of them are as stubborn as mules."</p>

<p><i>(Emily, wrathfully:</i> "What a disrespectful way to speak of
us! Oh, if I only hadn't on this Mother Hubbard I'd fling this door
open and confront them.")</p>

<p>"She needs a tight rein, if <i>I</i> know anything of human
nature," said Miss Potter. "She's going to be a flirt&mdash;anyone
can see that. She'll be Juliet over again. You'll see. She makes
eyes at every one and her only fourteen!"</p>

<p><i>(Emily, sarcastically:</i> "I do <i>not!</i> And Mother
wasn't a flirt. She <i>could</i> have been, but she wasn't.
<i>You</i> couldn't flirt, even if you wanted to&mdash;you
respectable old female!")</p>

<p>"She isn't pretty as poor Juliet was, and she's very
sly&mdash;sly and deep. Mrs. Dutton says she's the slyest child she
ever saw. But still there are things I like about poor Emily."</p>

<p>Mrs. Ann Cyrilla's tone was very patronizing. "Poor" Emily
writhed among the boots.</p>

<p>"The thing <i>I</i> don't like in her is that she is always
trying to be smart," said Miss Potter decidedly. "She says clever
things she has read in books and passes them off as her
own&mdash;"</p>

<p><i>(Emily, outraged:</i> "I don't!")</p>

<p>"And she's very sarcastic and touchy, and of course as proud as
Lucifer," concluded Miss Potter.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ann Cyrilla laughed pleasantly and tolerantly again.</p>

<p>"Oh, that goes without saying in a Murray. But their worst fault
is that they think nobody can do anything right but themselves, and
Emily is full of it. Why, she even thinks she can preach better
than Mr. Johnson."</p>

<p><i>(Emily:</i> "That is because I said he contradicted himself
in one of his sermons&mdash;and he <i>did.</i> And I've heard
<i>you</i> criticize dozens of sermons, Mrs. Ann Cyrilla.")</p>

<p>"She's jealous, too," continued Mrs. Ann Cyrilla. "She can't
bear to be beaten&mdash;she wants to be first in everything. I
understand she actually shed tears of mortification the night of
the concert because Ilse Burnley carried off the honours in the
dialogue. Emily did very poorly&mdash;she was a perfect
<i>stick.</i> And she contradicts older people continually. It
would be funny if it weren't so ill-bred."</p>

<p>"It's odd Elizabeth doesn't cure her of <i>that.</i> The Murrays
think their breeding is a little above the common," said Miss
Potter.</p>

<p><i>(Emily, wrathfully, to the boots:</i> "It <i>is,</i>
too.")</p>

<p>"Of course," said Mrs. Ann Cyrilla, "I think a great many of
Emily's faults come from her intimacy with Ilse Burnley. She
shouldn't be allowed to run about with Ilse as she does. Why, they
say Ilse is as much an infidel as her father. I have always
understood she doesn't believe in God at all&mdash;or the Devil
either."</p>

<p><i>(Emily:</i> "Which is a far worse thing in <i>your</i>
eyes.")</p>

<p>"Oh, the doctor's training her a little better now since he
found out his precious wife didn't elope with Leo Mitchell,"
sniffed Miss Potter. "He makes her go to Sunday-school. But she's
no fit associate for Emily. She swears like a trooper, I'm told.
Mrs. Mark Burns was in the doctor's office one day and heard Ilse
in the parlour say distinctly 'out, damned Spot!' probably to the
dog."</p>

<p>"Dear, dear," moaned Mrs. Ann Cyrilla.</p>

<p>"Do you know what <i>I</i> saw her do one day last
week&mdash;saw her with my own eyes!" Miss Potter was very emphatic
over this. Ann Cyrilla need not suppose that she had been using any
other person's eyes.</p>

<p>"You couldn't surprise me," gurgled Mrs. Ann Cyrilla. "Why, they
say she was at the charivari at Johnson's last Tuesday night,
dressed as a boy."</p>

<p>"Quite likely. But this happened in my own front yard. She was
there with Jen Strang, who had come to get a root of my Persian
rose-bush for her mother. I asked Ilse if she could sew and bake
and a few other things that I thought she ought to be reminded of.
Ilse said 'No' to them all, quite brazenly, and then <i>she</i>
said&mdash;<i>what</i> do you think that girl said?"</p>

<p>"Oh, what?" breathed Mrs. Ann Cyrilla eagerly.</p>

<p>"She said, 'Can <i>you</i> stand on one foot and lift your other
to a level with your eyes, Miss Potter? I can.' And"&mdash;Miss
Potter hushed her tone to the proper pitch of
horror&mdash;"<i>she</i> <i>did it!"</i></p>

<p>The listener in the closet stifled a spasm of laughter in Cousin
Jimmy's grey juniper. How madcap Ilse did love to shock Miss
Potter!</p>

<p>"Good gracious, were there any men around?" entreated Mrs. Ann
Cyrilla.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;fortunately. But it's my belief she would have done it
just the same no matter who was there. We were close to the
road&mdash;<i>anybody</i> might have been passing. I felt so
ashamed. In <i>my</i> time a young girl would have <i>died</i>
before she would have done a thing like that."</p>

<p>"It's no worse than her and Emily bathing by moonlight up on the
sands <i>without a stitch on,"</i> said Mrs. Ann Cyrilla.
<i>"That</i> was the most scandalous thing. Did you hear about
it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, that story's all over Blair Water. Everybody's heard
it but Elizabeth and Laura. I can't find out how it started. Were
they <i>seen?"</i></p>

<p>"Oh, dear no, not so bad as that. Ilse told it herself. She
seemed to think it was quite a matter of course. <i>I</i> think
some one ought to tell Laura and Elizabeth."</p>

<p>"Tell them yourself," suggested Miss Potter.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, <i>I</i> don't want to get in wrong with my neighbours.
<i>I</i> am not responsible for Emily Starr's training, thank
goodness. If I were I wouldn't let her have so much to do with
Jarback Priest, either. He's the queerest of all those queer
Priests. I'm sure he must have a bad influence over her. Those
green eyes of his positively give me the creeps. I can't find out
that he believes in <i>anything."</i></p>

<p><i>(Emily, sarcastically again:</i> "Not even the Devil?")</p>

<p>"There's a queer story going around about him and Emily," said
Miss Potter. "I can't make head or tail of it. They were seen on
the big hill last Wednesday evening at sunset, behaving in a most
extraordinary fashion. They would walk along with their eyes fixed
on the sky&mdash;then suddenly stop&mdash;grasp each other by the
arm and point upward. They did it time and again. Mrs. Price was
watching them from the window and she can't imagine what they were
up it. It was too early for stars, and <i>she</i> couldn't see a
solitary thing in the sky. She laid awake all night wondering about
it."</p>

<p>"Well, it all comes to this&mdash;Emily Starr needs looking
after," said Mrs. Ann Cyrilla. "I sometimes feel that it would be
wiser to stop Muriel and Gladys from going about so much with
her."</p>

<p><i>(Emily, devoutly:</i> "I wish you <i>would.</i> They are so
stupid and silly and they just stick around Ilse and me all the
time.")</p>

<p>"When all is said and done, I pity her," said Miss Potter.
"She's so foolish and high-minded that she'll get in wrong with
every one, and no decent, sensible man will ever be bothered with
her. Geoff North says he went home with her once and that was
enough for <i>him."</i></p>

<p><i>(Emily, emphatically:</i> "I believe you! Geoff showed almost
human intelligence in <i>that</i> remark.")</p>

<p>"But then she probably won't live through her teens. She looks
very consumptive. Really, Ann Cyrilla, I <i>do</i> feel sorry for
the poor thing."</p>

<p>This was the proverbial last straw for Emily. <i>She,</i> whole
Starr and half Murray to be pitied by Beulah Potter! Mother Hubbard
or no Mother Hubbard, it could not be borne! The closet door
suddenly opened wide and Emily stood revealed, Mother Hubbard and
all, against a background of boots and jumpers. Her cheeks were
crimson, her eyes black. The mouths of Mrs. Ann Cyrilla and Miss
Beulah Potter fell open and stayed open; their faces turned dull
red; they were dumb.</p>

<p>Emily looked at them steadily for a minute of scornful, eloquent
silence. Then, with the air of a queen, she swept across the
kitchen and vanished through the sitting-room door, just as Aunt
Elizabeth came up the sandstone steps with dignified apologies for
keeping them waiting. Miss Potter and Mrs. Ann Cyrilla were so
dumbfounded that they were hardly able to talk about the Ladies'
Aid, and got themselves confusedly away after a few jerky questions
and answers. Aunt Elizabeth did not know what to make of them and
thought they must have been unreasonably offended over having to
wait. Then she dismissed the matter from her mind. A Murray did not
care what Potters thought or did. The open closet door told no
tales, and she did not know that up in the lookout chamber Emily
was lying face downward across the bed crying passionately for
shame and anger and humiliation. She felt degraded and hurt. It had
all been the outcome of her own silly vanity in the
beginning&mdash;she acknowledged that&mdash;but her punishment had
been <i>too</i> severe.</p>

<p>She did not mind so much what Miss Potter had said, but Mrs. Ann
Cyrilla's tiny barbs of malice <i>did</i> sting. She had liked
pretty, pleasant Mrs. Ann Cyrilla, who had always seemed kind and
friendly and had paid her many compliments. She had thought Mrs.
Ann Cyrilla had really liked her. And now to find out that she
would talk about her like this!</p>

<p>"Couldn't they have said <i>one</i> good thing of me?" she
sobbed. "Oh, I feel <i>soiled,</i> somehow&mdash;between my own
silliness and their malice&mdash;and all dirty and messed-up
mentally. Will I ever feel <i>clean</i> again?"</p>

<p>She did not feel "clean" until she had written it all out in her
diary. Then she took a less distorted view of it and summoned
philosophy to her aid.</p>

<p>"Mr. Carpenter says we should make every experience teach us
something," she wrote. "He says every experience, no matter whether
it is pleasant or unpleasant, has something for us if we are able
to view it dispassionately. 'That,' he added bitterly, 'is one of
the pieces of good advice I have kept by me all my life and never
been able to make any use of myself.'</p>

<p>"Very well, I shall try to view this dispassionately! I suppose
the way to do it is to consider all that was said of me and decide
just what was <i>true</i> and what false, and what merely
distorted&mdash;which is worse than the false, I think.</p>

<p>"To begin with: hiding in the closet at all, just out of vanity,
comes under my heading of bad deeds. And I <i>suppose</i> that
appearing as I did, after I <i>had</i> stayed there so long, and
covering them with confusion, was another. But if so, I can't feel
it 'dispassionately' yet, because I am sinfully glad I did
it&mdash;yes, even if they did see me in the Mother Hubbard! I
shall never forget their faces! Especially Mrs. Ann Cyrilla's. Miss
Potter won't worry over it long&mdash;she will say it served me
right&mdash;but Mrs. Ann Cyrilla will never, to her dying day, get
over being <i>found out</i> like that.</p>

<p>"Now for a review of their criticisms of Emily Byrd Starr and
the decision as to whether said Emily Byrd Starr deserved the said
criticisms, wholly or in part. Be honest now, Emily, 'look then
into thy heart' and try to see yourself, not as Miss Potter sees
you or as you see yourself, but as you really are.</p>

<p>"(I think I'm going to find this interesting!)</p>

<p>"In the first place, Mrs. Ann Cyrilla said I was pig-headed.</p>

<p><i>"Am</i> I pig-headed?</p>

<p>"I know I am determined, and Aunt Elizabeth says I am stubborn.
But pig-headedness is worse than either of those. Determination is
a good quality and even stubbornness has a saving grace in it if
you have a little gumption as well. But a pig-headed person is one
who is too stupid to see or understand the foolishness of a certain
course and insists on taking it&mdash;insists, in short, on running
full tilt into a stone wall.</p>

<p>"No, I am <i>not</i> pig-headed. I accept stone walls.</p>

<p>"But I take a good deal of convincing that they <i>are</i> stone
walls and not cardboard imitations. Therefore, I <i>am</i> a little
stubborn.</p>

<p>"Miss Potter said I was a flirt. This is wholly untrue, so I
won't discuss it. But she also said I 'made eyes.' Now do I? I
don't mean to&mdash;I know that; but it seems you can 'make eyes'
without being conscious of it, so how am I going to prevent that? I
can't go about all the days of my life with my eyes dropped down.
Dean said the other day:</p>

<p>"'When you look at me like that, Star, there is nothing for me
but to do as you ask.'</p>

<p>"And Aunt Elizabeth was quite annoyed last week because she said
I was looking 'improperly' at Perry when I was coaxing him to go to
the Sunday-school picnic. (Perry hates Sunday-school picnics.)</p>

<p>"Now, in both cases I thought I was only looking
<i>beseechingly.</i></p>

<p>"Mrs. Ann Cyrilla said I wasn't pretty. Is that true?"</p>

<p>Emily laid down her pen, went over to the mirror and took a
"dispassionate" stock of her looks. Black of
hair&mdash;smoke-purple of eye&mdash;crimson of lip. So far, not
bad. Her forehead was too high, but the new way of doing her hair
obviated that defect. Her skin was very white and her cheeks, which
had been so pale in childhood, were now as delicately hued as a
pink pearl. Her mouth was too large, but her teeth were good. Her
slightly pointed ears gave her a fawn-like charm. Her neck had
lines that she could not help liking. Her slender, immature figure
was graceful; she knew, for Aunt Nancy had told her, that she had
the Shipley ankle and instep. Emily looked very earnestly at
Emily-in-the-Glass from several angles, and returned to her
diary.</p>

<p>"I have decided that I am not pretty," she wrote. "I think I
<i>look</i> quite pretty when my hair is done a certain way, but a
really pretty girl would be pretty no matter how her hair was done,
so Mrs. Ann Cyrilla was right. But I feel sure that I am not so
plain as she implied, either.</p>

<p>"Then she said I was sly&mdash;and <i>deep.</i> I don't think it
is any fault to be 'deep,' though she spoke as if she thought it
was. I would rather be deep than shallow. But am I sly? <i>No.</i>
I am <i>not.</i> Then what is it about me that makes people think I
am sly? Aunt Ruth always insists that I am. <i>I</i> think it is
because I have a habit, when I am bored or disgusted with people,
of stepping suddenly into my own world and shutting the door.
People resent this&mdash;I suppose it is only natural to resent a
door being shut in your face. They call it slyness when it is only
self-defence. So I won't worry over that.</p>

<p>"Miss Potter said an abominable thing&mdash;that I passed off
clever speeches I had read in books, as my own&mdash;trying to be
smart. That is <i>utterly false.</i> Honestly, I never 'try to be
smart.' But&mdash;I <i>do</i> try often to see how a certain thing
I've thought out sounds when it is put into words. Perhaps this is
a kind of showing-off. I must be careful about it.</p>

<p>"Jealous: no, I'm not that. I <i>do</i> like to be first, I
admit. But it wasn't because I was jealous of Ilse that I cried
that night at the concert. I cried because I felt I had made a mess
of my part. I <i>was</i> a stick, just as Mrs. Ann Cyrilla said. I
can't <i>act</i> a part somehow. Sometimes a certain part seems to
suit me and then I can <i>be</i> it, but if not I'm no good in a
dialogue. I only went in it to oblige Mrs. Johnson, and I felt
horribly mortified because I knew she was disappointed.</p>

<p>And I suppose my pride suffered a bit, but I never thought of
being jealous of Ilse. I was proud of her&mdash;she does
magnificently in a play.</p>

<p>"Yes, I contradict. I admit that <i>is</i> one of my faults. But
people do say such outrageous things! And why isn't it as bad for
people to contradict me? They do it continually&mdash;and I am
<i>right</i> just as often as they are.</p>

<p>"Sarcastic? Yes, I'm afraid that is another of my faults.
Touchy&mdash;no, I'm <i>not.</i> I'm only <i>sensitive.</i> And
proud? Well, yes, I <i>am</i> a little proud&mdash;but not nearly
as proud as people think me. I can't help carrying my head at a
certain angle and I can't help feeling it is a great thing to have
a century of good, upright people with fine traditions and
considerable brains behind you. Not like the Potters&mdash;upstarts
of yesterday!</p>

<p>"Oh, how those women garbled things about poor Ilse. We
couldn't, I suppose, expect a Potter or the wife of a Potter to
recognize the sleep-walking scene from <i>Lady Macbeth.</i> I have
told Ilse repeatedly that she ought to see that all doors are shut
when she tries it over. She is quite wonderful in it. She
<i>never</i> was at that charivari&mdash;she only said she'd
<i>like</i> to go. And as for the moonlight bathing&mdash;that was
true enough except that we had <i>some</i> stitches on. There was
nothing dreadful about it. It was perfectly beautiful&mdash;though
now it is all spoiled and degraded by being dragged about in common
gossip. I wish Ilse hadn't told about it.</p>

<p>"We had gone away up the sandshore for a walk. It was a moonlit
night and the sandshore was wonderful. The Wind Woman was rustling
in the grasses on the dunes and there was a long, gentle wash of
little gleaming waves on the shore. We wanted to bathe, but at
first we thought we couldn't because we didn't have our bathing
dresses. So we sat on the sands and we just talked. The great gulf
stretched out before us, silvery, gleaming, alluring, going farther
and farther into the mists of the northern sky. It was like an
ocean in 'fairylands forlorn.'</p>

<p>"I said:</p>

<p>"'I would like to get into a ship and sail straight out
there&mdash;out&mdash;out&mdash;where would I land?'</p>

<p>"'Anticosti, I expect,' said Ilse&mdash;a bit too prosaically, I
thought.</p>

<p>"'No&mdash;no&mdash;Ultima Thule, I think,' I said dreamily.
'Some beautiful unknown shore where "the rain never falls, and the
wind never blows." Perhaps the country back of the North Wind where
<i>Diamond</i> went. One could sail to it over that silver sea on a
night like this.'</p>

<p>"'<i>That</i> was heaven, I think,' said Ilse.</p>

<p>"Then we talked about immortality, and Ilse said she was afraid
of it&mdash;afraid of living for ever and for ever; she said she
was sure she would get awfully tired of herself. I said I thought I
liked Dean's idea of a succession of lives&mdash;I can't make out
from him whether he really believes that or not&mdash;and Ilse said
that might be all very well if you were sure of being born again as
a decent person, but how about it if you weren't?</p>

<p>"'Well, you have to take some risk in any kind of immortality,'
I said.</p>

<p>"'Anyhow,' said Ilse, 'whether I am myself or somebody else next
time, I do hope I won't have such a dreadful temper. If I just go
on being myself I'll smash my harp and tear my halo to pieces and
pull all the feathers out of the other angels' wings half an hour
after getting to heaven. You know I will, Emily. I can't help it. I
had a fiendish quarrel with Perry yesterday again. It was all my
fault&mdash;but of course he vexed me by his boasting. I
<i>wish</i> I could control my temper.'</p>

<p>"I don't mind Ilse's rages one bit now&mdash;I know she never
means anything she says in them. I never say anything back. I just
smile at her and if I've a bit of paper handy I jot down the things
she says. This infuriates her so that she chokes with anger and
can't say anything more. At all other times Ilse is a darling and
such good fun.</p>

<p>"'You can't control your rages because you like going into
them,' I said.</p>

<p>"Ilse stared at me.</p>

<p>"'I don't&mdash;I don't.'</p>

<p>"'You do. You enjoy them,' I insisted.</p>

<p>"'Well, of course," said Ilse, grinning, "I <i>do</i> have a
good time while they last. It's awfully <i>satisfying</i> to say
the most insulting things and call the worst names. I believe
you're right, Emily. I <i>do</i> enjoy them. Queer I never thought
of it. I suppose if I really were unhappy in them I wouldn't go
into them. But after they're over&mdash;I'm so remorseful. I cried
for an hour yesterday after fighting with Perry.'</p>

<p>"'Yes, and you enjoyed that, too&mdash;didn't you?'</p>

<p>"Ilse reflected.</p>

<p>"'I guess so, Emily; you're an uncanny thing. I won't talk about
it any more. Let's go bathing. No dresses? What does it matter.
There isn't a soul for miles. I can't resist those waves. They're
<i>calling</i> me.'</p>

<p>"I felt just as she did, and bathing by moonlight seemed such a
lovely, romantic thing&mdash;and it <i>is,</i> when the Potters of
the world don't know of it. When they do, they smudge it. We
undressed in a little hollow among the dunes&mdash;that was like a
bowl of silver in the moonlight&mdash;but we kept our petticoats
on. We had the loveliest time splashing and swimming about in that
silver-blue water and those creamy little waves, like mermaids or
sea nymphs. It was like living in a poem or a fairy tale. And when
we came out I held out my hands to Ilse and said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Come unto these yellow sands<br>
Curtseyed when we have and kissed,<br>
The wild winds whist,<br>
Foot it featly here and there<br>
And, sweet sprites, the burden bear.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>"Ilse took my hands and we danced in rings over the moonlit
sands, and then we went up to the silver bowl and dressed and went
home perfectly happy. Only, of course, we had to carry our wet
petticoats rolled up under our arms, so we looked rather slinky,
but nobody saw us. And <i>that</i> is what Blair Water is so
scandalized about.</p>

<p>"All the same, I hope Aunt Elizabeth won't hear of it.</p>

<p>"It is too bad Mrs. Price lost so much sleep over Dean and me.
We were not performing any weird incantations&mdash;we were simply
walking over the Delectable Mountain and tracing pictures in the
clouds. Perhaps it was childish&mdash;but it was great fun. That is
one thing I like about Dean&mdash;he isn't afraid of doing
something harmless and pleasant just because it's childish. One
cloud he pointed out to me looked exactly like an angel flying
along the pale, shining sky and carrying a baby in its arms. There
was a filmy blue veil over its head with a faint, first star
gleaming through it. Its wings were tipped with gold and its white
robe flecked with crimson.</p>

<p>"'There goes the Angel of the Evening Star with to-morrow in its
arms,' said Dean.</p>

<p>"It was so beautiful that it gave me one of my wonder moments.
But ten seconds later it had changed into something that looked
like a camel with an exaggerated hump!</p>

<p>"We had a wonderful half hour, even if Mrs. Price, who couldn't
see anything in the sky, did think us quite mad.</p>

<p>"Well, it all comes to this, there's no use trying to live in
other people's opinions. The only thing to do is to live in your
own. After all, I believe in myself. I'm not so bad and silly as
they think me, and I'm not consumptive, and I <i>can</i> write. Now
that I've written it all out I feel differently about it. The only
thing that still aggravates me is that Miss Potter <i>pitied</i>
me&mdash;pitied by a Potter!</p>

<p>"I looked out of my window just now and saw Cousin Jimmy's
nasturtium bed&mdash;and suddenly the flash came&mdash;and Miss
Potter and her pity, and her malicious tongue seemed to matter not
at all. Nasturtiums, who coloured you, you wonderful, glowing
things? You must have been fashioned out of summer sunsets.</p>

<p>"I help Cousin Jimmy a great deal with his garden this summer. I
think I love it as much as he does. Every day we make new
discoveries of bud and bloom.</p>

<p>"So Aunt Elizabeth won't send me to Shrewsbury! Oh, I feel as
disappointed as if I'd really hoped she would. Every door in life
seems shut to me.</p>

<p>"Still, after all, I've lots to be thankful for. Aunt Elizabeth
will let me go to school another year here, I think, and Mr.
Carpenter can teach me heaps yet; I'm not hideous; moonlight is
still a fair thing; I'm going to do something with my pen some
day&mdash;<i>and</i> I've got a lovely, grey, moon-faced cat who
has just jumped up on my table and poked my pen with his nose as a
signal that I've written enough for one sitting.</p>

<p>"The only real cat is a grey cat!"</p>

<h2><a name="c05" id="c05"><i>Half a Loaf</i></a>
</h2>

<p>One late August evening Emily heard Teddy's signal whistle from
the To-morrow Road, and slipped out to join him. He had
news&mdash;that was evident from his shining eyes.</p>

<p>"Emily," he cried excitedly, "I'm going to Shrewsbury after all!
Mother told me this evening she had made up her mind to let me
go!"</p>

<p>Emily was glad&mdash;with a queer sorriness underneath, for
which she reproached herself. How lonesome it would be at New Moon
when her three old pals were gone! She had not realized until that
moment how much she had counted on Teddy's companionship. He had
always been there in the background of her thoughts of the coming
year. She had always taken Teddy for granted. Now there would be
nobody&mdash;not even Dean, for Dean was going away for the winter
as usual&mdash;to Egypt or Japan, as he might decide at the last
moment. What would she do? Would all the Jimmy-books in the world
take the place of her flesh-and-blood chums?</p>

<p>"If you were only going, too!" said Teddy, as they walked along
the To-morrow Road&mdash;which was almost a To-day Road now, so
fast and so tall had the leafy young maples grown.</p>

<p>"There's no use wishing it&mdash;don't speak of it&mdash;it
makes me unhappy," said Emily jerkily.</p>

<p>"Well, we'll have week-ends anyhow. And it's you I have to thank
for going. It was what you said to Mother that night in the
graveyard that made her let me go. I know she's been thinking of it
ever since, by things she would say every once in a while. One day
last week I heard her muttering: 'It's awful to be a
mother&mdash;awful to be a mother and suffer like this.' Yet she
called me selfish!' And another time she said, 'Is it selfish to
want to keep the only thing you have left in the world?' But she
was lovely to-night when she told me I could go. I know folks say
Mother isn't quite right in her mind&mdash;and sometimes she
<i>is</i> a little queer. But it's only when other people are
around. You've no idea, Emily, how nice and dear she is when we're
alone. I hate to leave her. But I <i>must</i> get some
education!"</p>

<p>"I'm very glad if what I said has made her change her mind, but
she will never forgive me for it. She has hated me ever
since&mdash;you know she has. You know how she <i>looks</i> at me
whenever I'm at the Tansy Patch&mdash;oh, she's very polite to me.
But her eyes, Teddy."</p>

<p>"I know," said Teddy, uncomfortably. "But don't be hard on
Mother, Emily. I'm sure she wasn't always like that&mdash;though
she has been ever since I can remember. I don't know
<i>anything</i> of her before that. She never tells me
anything&mdash;I don't know a thing about my father. She won't talk
about him. I don't even know how she got that scar on her
face."</p>

<p>"I don't think there's anything the matter with your mother's
mind, really," said Emily slowly. "But I think there's something
troubling it&mdash;always troubling it&mdash;something she can't
forget or throw off. Teddy, I'm sure your mother is <i>haunted.</i>
Of course, I don't mean by a ghost or anything silly like that. But
by some terrible <i>thought."</i></p>

<p>"She isn't happy, I know," said Teddy, "and, of course, we're
poor. Mother said to-night she could only send me to Shrewsbury for
three years&mdash;that was all she could afford. But that will give
me a start&mdash;I'll get on somehow after that. I <i>know</i> I
can. I'll make it up to her yet."</p>

<p>"You will be a great artist some day," said Emily dreamily.</p>

<p>They had come to the end of the To-morrow Road. Before them was
the pond pasture, whitened over with a drift of daisies. Farmers
hate the daisies as a pestiferous weed, but a field white with them
on a summer twilight is a vision from the Land of Lost Delight.
Beneath them Blair Water shone like a great golden lily. Up on the
eastern hill the little Disappointed House crouched amid its
shadows, dreaming, perhaps, of the false bride that had never come
to it. There was no light at the Tansy Patch. Was lonely Mrs. Kent
crying there in the darkness, with only her secret, tormenting
heart-hunger for companion?</p>

<p>Emily was looking at the sunset sky&mdash;her eyes rapt, her
face pale and seeking. She felt no longer blue or
depressed&mdash;somehow she never could feel that way long in
Teddy's company. In all the world there was no music like his
voice. All good things seemed suddenly possible with him. She could
not go to Shrewsbury&mdash;but she could work and study at New
Moon&mdash;oh, how she would work and study. Another year with Mr.
Carpenter would do a great deal for her&mdash;as much as
Shrewsbury, perhaps. She, too, had her Alpine Path to
climb&mdash;she <i>would</i> climb it, no matter what the obstacles
in the way&mdash;no matter whether there was any one to help her or
not.</p>

<p>"When I am I'll paint you just as you're looking now," said
Teddy, "and call it Joan of Arc&mdash;with a face all
spirit&mdash;listening to her voices."</p>

<p>In spite of her voices Emily went to bed that night feeling
rather down-hearted&mdash;and woke in the morning with an
unaccountable conviction that some good news was coming to her that
day&mdash;a conviction that did not lessen as the hours passed by
in the commonplace fashion of Saturday hours at New Moon&mdash;busy
hours in which the house was made immaculate for Sunday, and the
pantry replenished. It was a cool, damp day when the fogs were
coming up from the shore on the east wind, and New Moon and its old
garden were veiled in mist.</p>

<p>At twilight a thin, grey rain began to fall, and still the good
news had not come. Emily had just finished scouring the brass
candlesticks and composing a poem called <i>Rain Song,</i>
simultaneously, when Aunt Laura told her that Aunt Elizabeth wanted
to see her in the parlour.</p>

<p>Emily's recollections of parlour interviews with Aunt Elizabeth
were not especially pleasant. She could not recall any recent deed,
done or left undone, which would justify this summons, yet she
walked into the parlour quakingly: whatever Aunt Elizabeth was
going to say to her it must have some special significance or it
would not be said in the parlour. This was just one of Aunt
Elizabeth's little ways. Daffy, her big cat, slipped in beside her
like a noiseless, grey shadow. She hoped Aunt Elizabeth would not
shoo him out: his presence was a certain comfort: a cat is a good
backer when he is on your side!</p>

<p>Aunt Elizabeth was knitting; she looked solemn but not offended
or angry. She ignored Daff, but thought that Emily seemed very tall
in the old, stately, twilit room. How quickly children grew up! It
seemed but the other day since fair, pretty Juliet&mdash;Elizabeth
Murray shut her thoughts off with a click.</p>

<p>"Sit down, Emily," she said. "I want to have a talk with
you."</p>

<p>Emily sat down. So did Daffy, wreathing his tail comfortably
about his paws. Emily suddenly felt that her hands were clammy and
her mouth dry. She wished that she had knitting, too. It was nasty
to sit there, unoccupied, and wonder what was coming. What
<i>did</i> come was the one thing she had never thought of. Aunt
Elizabeth, after knitting a deliberate round on her stocking, said
directly:</p>

<p>"Emily, would you like to go to Shrewsbury next week?"</p>

<p>Go to Shrewsbury? Had she heard aright?</p>

<p>"Oh, Aunt Elizabeth!" she said.</p>

<p>"I have been talking the matter over with your uncles and
aunts," said Aunt Elizabeth. "They agree with me that you should
have some further education. It will be a considerable expense, of
course&mdash;no, don't interrupt. I don't like
interruptions&mdash;but Ruth will board you for half-price, as her
contribution to your up-bringing&mdash;Emily, <i>I</i> will
<i>not</i> be interrupted! Your Uncle Oliver will pay the other
half; your Uncle Wallace will provide your books, and I will see to
your clothes. You will, of course, help your Aunt Ruth about the
house in every way possible as some return for her kindness. You
may go to Shrewsbury for three years on a certain condition."</p>

<p>What was the condition? Emily, who wanted to dance and sing and
laugh through the old parlour as no Murray, not ever her mother,
had ever ventured to dance and laugh before, constrained herself to
sit rigidly on her ottoman and ask herself that question. Behind
her suspense she felt that the moment was quite dramatic.</p>

<p>"Three years at Shrewsbury," Aunt Elizabeth went on, "will do as
much for you as three at Queen's&mdash;except, of course, that you
don't get a teacher's licence, which doesn't matter in your case,
as you are not under the necessity of working for your living. But,
as I have said, there is a condition."</p>

<p><i>Why</i> didn't Aunt Elizabeth name the condition? Emily felt
that the suspense was unendurable. Could it be possible that Aunt
Elizabeth was a little <i>afraid</i> to name it? It was not like
her to talk for time. Was it so very terrible?</p>

<p>"You must promise," said Aunt Elizabeth sternly, "that for the
three years you are at Shrewsbury you will give up entirely this
writing nonsense of yours&mdash;<i>entirely,</i> except in so far
as school compositions may be required."</p>

<p>Emily sat very still&mdash;and cold. No Shrewsbury on the one
hand&mdash;on the other no more poems, no more stories and
"studies," no more delightful Jimmy-books of miscellany. She did
not take more than one instant to make up her mind.</p>

<p>"I can't promise that, Aunt Elizabeth," she said resolutely.</p>

<p>Aunt Elizabeth dropped her knitting in amazement. She had not
expected this. She had thought Emily was so set on going to
Shrewsbury that she would do anything that might be asked of her in
order to go&mdash;especially such a trifling thing as
this&mdash;which, so Aunt Elizabeth thought, involved only a
surrender of stubbornness.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say you won't give up your foolish scribbling
for the sake of the education you've always pretended to want so
much?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"Not that I <i>won't&mdash;</i>it's just that I <i>can't,"</i>
said Emily despairingly. She knew Aunt Elizabeth could not
understand&mdash;Aunt Elizabeth never had understood <i>this.</i>
"I <i>can't</i> help writing, Aunt Elizabeth. It's in my blood.
There's no use in asking me. I <i>do</i> want an education&mdash;it
isn't pretending&mdash;but I can't give up my writing to get it. I
<i>couldn't</i> keep such a promise&mdash;so what use would there
be in making it?"</p>

<p>"Then you can stay home," said Aunt Elizabeth angrily.</p>

<p>Emily expected to see her get up and walk out of the room.
Instead, Aunt Elizabeth picked up her stocking and wrathfully
resumed her knitting. To tell the truth, Aunt Elizabeth was
absurdly taken aback. She really wanted to send Emily to
Shrewsbury. Tradition required so much of her, and all the clan
were of opinion she should be sent. This condition had been her own
idea. She thought it a good chance to break Emily of a silly
un-Murray-like habit of wasting time and paper, and she had never
doubted that her plan would succeed, for she knew how much Emily
wanted to go. And now this senseless, unreasoning, ungrateful
obstinacy&mdash;"the Starr coming out," thought Aunt Elizabeth
rancorously, forgetful of the Shipley inheritance! What was to be
done? She knew too well from past experience that there would be no
moving Emily once she had taken up a position, and she knew that
Wallace and Oliver and Ruth, though they thought Emily's craze for
writing as silly and untraditional as she did, would not back
her&mdash;Elizabeth&mdash;up in her demand. Elizabeth Murray
foresaw a complete right-about-face before her, and Elizabeth
Murray did not like the prospect. She could have shaken, with a
right good will, the slim, pale thing sitting before her on the
ottoman. The creature was so slight&mdash;and young&mdash;and
indomitable. For over three years Elizabeth Murray had tried to
cure Emily of this foolishness of writing and for over three years
she, who had never failed in anything before, had failed in this.
One couldn't starve her into submission&mdash;and nothing short of
it would seem to be efficacious.</p>

<p>Elizabeth knitted furiously in her vexation, and Emily sat
motionless, struggling with her bitter disappointment and sense of
injustice. She was determined she would not cry before Aunt
Elizabeth, but it was hard to keep the tears back. She wished Daff
wouldn't purr with such resounding satisfaction, as if everything
were perfectly delicious from a grey cat's point of view. She
wished Aunt Elizabeth would tell her to go. But Aunt Elizabeth only
knitted furiously and said nothing. It all seemed rather
nightmarish. The wind was rising and the rain began to drive
against the pane, and the dead-and-gone Murrays looked down
accusingly from their dark frames. <i>They</i> had no sympathy with
flashes and Jimmy-books and Alpine paths&mdash;with the pursuit of
unwon, alluring divinities. Yet Emily couldn't help thinking, under
all her disappointment, what an excellent setting it would make for
some tragic scene in a novel.</p>

<p>The door opened and Cousin Jimmy slipped in. Cousin Jimmy knew
what was in the wind and had been coolly and deliberately listening
outside the door. <i>He</i> knew Emily would never promise such a
thing&mdash;he had told Elizabeth so at the family council ten days
before. <i>He</i> was only simply Jimmy Murray, but he understood
what sensible Elizabeth Murray could not understand.</p>

<p>"What is wrong?" he asked, looking from one to the other.</p>

<p>"Nothing is wrong," said Aunt Elizabeth haughtily. "I have
offered Emily an education and she has refused it. She is free to
do so, of course."</p>

<p>"No one can be free who has a thousand ancestors," said Cousin
Jimmy in the eerie tone in which he generally said such things. It
always made Elizabeth shiver&mdash;she could never forget that his
eeriness was <i>her</i> fault. "Emily can't promise what you want.
Can you, Emily?"</p>

<p>"No." In spite of herself a couple of big tears rolled down
Emily's cheeks.</p>

<p>"If you <i>could,"</i> said Cousin Jimmy, "you <i>would</i>
promise it for <i>me,</i> wouldn't you?"</p>

<p>Emily nodded.</p>

<p>"You've asked too much, Elizabeth," said Cousin Jimmy to the
angry lady of the knitting-needles. "You've asked her to give up
<i>all</i> her writing&mdash;now, if you'd just asked her to give
up <i>some</i>&mdash;Emily, what if she just asked you to give up
<i>some?</i> You might be able to do that, mightn't you?"</p>

<p>"What <i>some?"</i> asked Emily cautiously.</p>

<p>"Well, anything that wasn't <i>true,</i> for instance." Cousin
Jimmy sidled over to Emily and put a beseeching hand on her
shoulder. Elizabeth did not stop knitting, but the needles went
more slowly. <i>"Stories,</i> for instance, Emily. She doesn't like
your writing stories, especially. She thinks they're lies. She
doesn't mind other things so much. Don't you think, Emily, you
could give up writing stories for three years? An education is a
great thing. Your grandmother Archibald would have lived on herring
tails to get an education&mdash;many a time I've heard her say it.
Come, Emily?"</p>

<p>Emily thought rapidly. She loved writing stories: it would be a
hard thing to give them up. But if she could still write air-born
fancies in verse&mdash;and weird little Jimmy-book sketches of
character&mdash;and accounts of everyday
events&mdash;witty&mdash;satirical&mdash;tragic&mdash;as the humour
took her&mdash;she might be able to get along.</p>

<p>"Try her&mdash;try her," whispered Cousin Jimmy. "Propitiate her
a little. You do owe her a great deal, Emily. Meet her
half-way."</p>

<p>"Aunt Elizabeth," said Emily tremulously, "if you will send me
to Shrewsbury I promise you that for three years I won't write
anything that isn't <i>true.</i> Will that do? Because it's
<i>all</i> I can promise."</p>

<p>Elizabeth knitted two rounds before deigning to reply. Cousin
Jimmy and Emily thought she was not going to reply at all. Suddenly
she folded up her knitting and rose.</p>

<p>"Very well. I will let it go at that. It is, of course, your
stories I object to most: as for the rest, I fancy Ruth will see to
it that you have not much time to waste on it."</p>

<p>Aunt Elizabeth swept out, much relieved in her secret heart that
she had not been utterly routed, but had been enabled to retreat
from a perplexing position with some of the honours of war. Cousin
Jimmy patted Emily's black head.</p>

<p>"That's good, Emily. Mustn't be too stubborn, you know. And
three years isn't a lifetime, pussy."</p>

<p>No: but it seems like one at fourteen. Emily cried herself to
sleep when she went to bed&mdash;and woke again at three by the
clock, of that windy, dark-grey night on the old north
shore&mdash;rose&mdash;lighted a candle&mdash;sat down at her table
and described the whole scene in her Jimmy-book; being exceedingly
careful to write therein no word that was not strictly true!</p>

<h2><a name="c06" id="c06"><i>Shrewsbury Beginnings</i></a>
</h2>

<p>Teddy and Ilse and Perry whooped for joy when Emily told them
she was going to Shrewsbury. Emily, thinking it over, was
reasonably happy. The great thing was that she was going to High
School. She did not like the idea of boarding with Aunt Ruth. This
was unexpected. She had supposed Aunt Ruth would never be willing
to have <i>her</i> about and that, if Aunt Elizabeth <i>did</i>
decide to send her to Shrewsbury, she would board
elsewhere&mdash;probably with Ilse. Certainly, she would have
greatly preferred this. She knew quite well that life would not be
very easy under Aunt Ruth's roof. And then she must write no more
stories.</p>

<p>To feel within her the creative urge and be forbidden to express
it&mdash;to tingle with delight in the conception of humorous or
dramatic characters, and be forbidden to bring them into
existence&mdash;to be suddenly seized with the idea of a capital
plot and realize immediately afterward that you couldn't develop
it. All this was a torture which no one who has not been born with
the fatal itch for writing can realize. The Aunt Elizabeths of the
world can never understand it. To them, it is merely
foolishness.</p>

<p>Those last two weeks of August were busy ones at New Moon.
Elizabeth and Laura held long conferences over Emily's clothes. She
must have an outfit that would cast no discredit on the Murrays,
but common sense and not fashion was to give the casting vote.
Emily herself had no say in the matter. Laura and Elizabeth argued
"from noon to dewy eve" one day as to whether Emily might have a
taffeta silk blouse&mdash;Ilse had three&mdash;and decided against
it, much to Emily's disappointment. But Laura had her way in regard
to what she dared not call an "evening dress," since the name would
have doomed it in Elizabeth's opinion: it was a pretty crepe thing,
of a pinkish-grey&mdash;the shade, I think, which was then called
ashes-of-roses&mdash;and was made collarless&mdash;a great
concession on Elizabeth's part&mdash;with the big puffed sleeves
that look very absurd to-day, but which, like every other fashion,
were pretty and piquant when worn by the youth and beauty of their
time. It was the prettiest dress Emily had ever had&mdash;and the
longest, which meant much in those days, when you could not be
grown up until you had put on "long" dresses. It came to her pretty
ankles.</p>

<p>She put it on one evening, when Laura and Elizabeth were away,
because she wanted Dean to see her in it. He had come up to spend
the evening with her&mdash;he was off the next day, having decided
on Egypt&mdash;and they walked in the garden. Emily felt quite old
and sophisticated because she had to lift her shimmering skirt
clear of the ribbon grasses. She had a little greyish-pink scarf
wound around her head and looked more like a star than ever, Dean
thought. The cats were in attendance&mdash;Daffy, sleek and
striped, Saucy Sal, who still reigned supreme in the New Moon
barns. Cats might come and cats might go, but Saucy Sal went on for
ever. They frisked over the grass plots and pounced on each other
from flowery jungles and rolled insinuatingly around Emily's feet.
Dean was going to Egypt but he knew that nowhere, even amid the
strange charm of forgotten empires, would he see anything he liked
better than the pretty picture Emily and her little cats made in
the prim, stately, scented old garden of New Moon.</p>

<p>They did not talk as much as usual and the silences did queer
things to both of them. Dean had one or two mad impulses to throw
up the trip to Egypt and stay home for the winter&mdash;go to
Shrewsbury perhaps; he shrugged his shoulders and laughed at
himself. This child did not need his looking after&mdash;the ladies
of New Moon were competent guardians. She was only a child
yet&mdash;in spite of her slim height and her unfathomable eyes.
But how perfect the white line of her throat&mdash;how kissable the
sweet red curve of her mouth. She would be a woman soon&mdash;but
not for him&mdash;not for lame Jarback Priest of her father's
generation. For the hundredth time Dean told himself that he was
not going to be a fool. He must be content with what fate had given
him&mdash;the friendship and affection of this exquisite, starry
creature. In the years to come her love would be a wonderful
thing&mdash;for some other man. No doubt, thought Dean cynically,
she would waste it on some good-looking young manikin who wasn't
half worthy of it.</p>

<p>Emily was thinking how dreadfully she was going to miss
Dean&mdash;more than she had ever missed him before. They had been
such good pals that summer. She had never had a talk with him, even
if it were only for a few minutes, without feeling that life was
richer. His wise, witty, humorous, satiric sayings were educative.
They stimulated&mdash;stung&mdash;inspired her. And his occasional
compliments gave her self-confidence. He had a certain strange
fascination for her that no one else in the world possessed. She
felt it though she could not analyse it. Teddy, now&mdash;she knew
perfectly well why she liked Teddy. It was just because of his
Teddyness. And Perry&mdash;Perry was a jolly, sunburned, outspoken,
boastful rogue you couldn't help liking. But Dean was different.
Was his charm the allure of the unknown&mdash;of
experience&mdash;of subtle knowledge&mdash;of a mind grown wise on
bitterness&mdash;of things Dean knew that she could never know?
Emily couldn't tell. She only knew that everybody tasted a little
flat after Dean&mdash;even Teddy, though she liked him best.</p>

<p>Oh, yes, Emily never had any doubt at all that she liked Teddy
best. And yet Dean seemed to satisfy some part of her subtle and
intricate nature that always went hungry without him.</p>

<p>"Thank you for all you've taught me, Dean," she said as they
stood by the sundial.</p>

<p>"Do you think you have taught me nothing, Star?"</p>

<p>"How could I? I'm so young&mdash;so ignorant&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You've taught me how to laugh without bitterness, I hope you'll
never realize what a boon that is. Don't let them spoil you at
Shrewsbury, Star. You're so pleased over going that I don't want to
throw cold water. But you'd be just as well
off&mdash;better&mdash;here at New Moon."</p>

<p>"Dean! I want <i>some</i> education&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Education! Education isn't being spoon-fed with algebra and
second-rate Latin. Old Carpenter could teach you more and better
than the college cubs, male and female, in Shrewsbury High
School."</p>

<p>"I can't go to school any more here," protested Emily. "I'd be
all alone. All the pupils of my age are going to Queen's or
Shrewsbury or staying home. I don't understand you, Dean. I thought
you'd be so glad they're letting me go to Shrewsbury."</p>

<p>"I <i>am</i> glad&mdash;since it pleases you. Only&mdash;the
lore I wished for you isn't learned in High Schools or measured by
terminal exams. Whatever of worth you get at any school you'll dig
out for yourself. Don't let them make anything of you but yourself,
that's all. I don't think they will."</p>

<p>"No, they won't," said Emily decidedly. "I'm like Kipling's
cat&mdash;I walk by my wild lone and wave my wild tail where so it
pleases me. That's why the Murrays look askance at me. They think I
should only run with the pack. Oh, Dean, you'll write me often,
won't you? Nobody understands like you. And you've got to be such a
habit with me I can't do without you."</p>

<p>Emily said&mdash;and meant&mdash;it lightly enough; but Dean's
thin face flushed darkly. They did not say good-bye&mdash;that was
an old compact of theirs. Dean waved his hand at her.</p>

<p>"May every day be kind to you," he said.</p>

<p>Emily gave him only her slow, mysterious smile&mdash;he was
gone. The garden seemed very lonely in the faint blue twilight,
with the ghostly blossoms of the white phlox here and there. She
was glad when she heard Teddy's whistle in Lofty John's Bush.</p>

<p>On her last evening at home she went to see Mr. Carpenter and
get his opinion regarding some manuscripts she had left with him
for criticism the preceding week. Among them were her latest
stories, written before Aunt Elizabeth's ultimatum. Criticism was
something Mr. Carpenter could give with a right good will and he
never minced matters; but he was just, and Emily had confidence in
his verdicts, even when he said things that raised temporary
blisters on her soul.</p>

<p>"This love story is no good," he said bluntly.</p>

<p>"I know that it isn't what I wanted to make it," sighed
Emily.</p>

<p>"No story ever is," said Mr. Carpenter. "You'll never write
anything that really satisfies you though it may satisfy other
people. As for love stories, you can't write them because you can't
feel them. Don't try to write anything you can't feel&mdash;it will
be a failure&mdash;'echoes nothing worth.' This other yarn
now&mdash;about this old woman. It's not bad. The dialogue is
clever&mdash;the climax simple and effective. And thank the Lord
you've got a sense of humour. <i>That's</i> mainly why you're no
good at love stories, I believe. Nobody with any real sense of
humour <i>can</i> write a love story."</p>

<p>Emily didn't see why this should be. She liked writing love
stories&mdash;and terribly sentimental, tragical stories they
were.</p>

<p>"Shakespeare could," she said defiantly.</p>

<p>"You're hardly in the Shakespeare class," said Mr. Carpenter
dryly.</p>

<p>Emily blushed scorchingly.</p>

<p>"I <i>know</i> I'm not. But you said <i>nobody."</i></p>

<p>"And I maintain it. Shakespeare is the exception that proves the
rule. Though <i>his</i> sense of humour was certainly in abeyance
when he wrote <i>Romeo and Juliet.</i> However, let's come back to
Emily of New Moon. <i>This</i> story&mdash;well, a young person
might read it without contamination."</p>

<p>Emily knew by the inflection of Mr. Carpenter's voice that he
was not praising her story. She kept silence and Mr. Carpenter went
on, flicking her precious manuscripts aside irreverently.</p>

<p>"This one sounds like a weak imitation of Kipling. Been reading
him lately?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I thought so. Don't try to imitate Kipling. If you <i>must</i>
imitate, imitate Laura Jean Libbey. Nothing good about this but its
title. A priggish little yarn. And <i>Hidden Riches</i> is not a
story&mdash;it's a machine. It creaks. It never made me forget for
one instant that it <i>was</i> a story. Hence it <i>isn't</i> a
story."</p>

<p>"I was trying to write something very true to life," protested
Emily.</p>

<p>"Ah, that's why. We all see life through an illusion&mdash;even
the most disillusioned of us. That's why things aren't convincing
if they're too true to life. Let me see&mdash;<i>The Madden
Family</i>&mdash;another attempt at realism. But it's only
photography&mdash;not portraiture."</p>

<p>"What a lot of disagreeable things you've said," sighed
Emily.</p>

<p>"It might be a nice world if nobody ever said a disagreeable
thing, but it would be a dangerous one," retorted Mr. Carpenter.
"You told me you wanted criticism, not taffy. However, here's a bit
of taffy for you. I kept it for the last. <i>Something
Different</i> is comparatively good and if I wasn't afraid of
ruining you I'd say it was absolutely good. Ten years from now you
can rewrite it and make something of it. Yes, ten years&mdash;don't
screw up your face, Jade. You have talent&mdash;and you've got a
wonderful feeling for words&mdash;you get the inevitable one every
time&mdash;that's a priceless thing. But you have some vile faults,
too. Those cursed italics&mdash;forswear them, Jade, forswear them.
And your imagination needs a curb when you get away from
realism."</p>

<p>"It's to have one now," said Emily, gloomily.</p>

<p>She told him of her compact with Aunt Elizabeth. Mr. Carpenter
nodded.</p>

<p>"Excellent."</p>

<p>"Excellent!" echoed Emily blankly.</p>

<p>"Yes. It's just what you need. It will teach you restraint and
economy. Stick to facts for three years and see what you can make
of them. Leave the realm of imagination severely alone and confine
yourself to ordinary life."</p>

<p>"There isn't any such thing as ordinary life," said Emily.</p>

<p>Mr. Carpenter looked at her for a moment.</p>

<p>"You're right&mdash;there isn't," he said slowly. "But one
wonders a little how you know it. Well, go on&mdash;go
on&mdash;walk in your chosen path&mdash;and 'thank whatever gods
there be' that you're free to walk it."</p>

<p>"Cousin Jimmy says nobody can be free who has a thousand
ancestors."</p>

<p>"And yet people call that man simple," muttered Mr. Carpenter.
"However, your ancestors don't seem to have wished any special
curse on you. They've simply laid it on you to aim for the heights
and they'll give you no peace if you don't. Call it
ambition&mdash;aspiration&mdash;<i>caco&euml;thes
scribendi</i>&mdash;any name you will. Under its sting&mdash;or
allure&mdash;one has to go on climbing&mdash;until one
fails&mdash;or&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Succeeds," said Emily, flinging back her dark head.</p>

<p>"Amen," said Mr. Carpenter.</p>

<p>Emily wrote a poem that night&mdash;<i>Farewell to New
Moon</i>&mdash;and shed tears over it. She felt every line of it.
It was all very well to be going to school&mdash;but to leave dear
New Moon! Everything at New Moon was linked with her life and
thoughts&mdash;was a part of her.</p>

<p>"It's not only that I love my room and trees and
hills&mdash;they love me," she thought.</p>

<p>Her little black trunk was packed. Aunt Elizabeth had seen that
everything necessary was in it, and Aunt Laura and Cousin Jimmy had
seen that one or two unnecessary things were in it. Aunt Laura had
told Emily that she would find a pair of black lace stockings
inside her strap slippers&mdash;even Laura did not dare go so far
as silk stockings&mdash;and Cousin Jimmy had given her three
Jimmy-books and an envelope with a five-dollar bill in it.</p>

<p>"To get anything you want with, Pussy. I'd have made it ten but
five was all Elizabeth would advance me on next month's wages. I
think she suspected."</p>

<p>"Can I spend a dollar of it for American stamps if I can find a
way to get them?" whispered Emily anxiously.</p>

<p>"Anything you like," repeated Cousin Jimmy loyally&mdash;though
even to him it did not appear an unaccountable thing that any one
should want to buy American stamps. But if dear little Emily wanted
American stamps, American stamps she should have.</p>

<p>The next day seemed rather dream-like to Emily&mdash;the bird
she heard singing rapturously in Lofty John's bush when she woke at
dawn&mdash;the drive to Shrewsbury in the early crisp September
morning&mdash;Aunt Ruth's cool welcome&mdash;the hours at a strange
school&mdash;the organization of the "Prep" classes&mdash;home to
supper&mdash;surely it must all have taken more than a day.</p>

<p>Aunt Ruth's house was at the end of a residential side
street&mdash;almost out in the country. Emily thought it a very
ugly house, covered as it was with gingerbread-work of various
kinds. But a house with white wooden lace on its roof and its bay
windows was the last word of elegance in Shrewsbury. There was no
garden&mdash;nothing but a bare, prim, little lawn; but one thing
rejoiced Emily's eyes. Behind the house was a big plantation of
tall, slender fir-trees&mdash;the tallest, straightest, slenderest
firs she had ever seen, stretching back into long, green,
gossamered vistas.</p>

<p>Aunt Elizabeth had spent the day in Shrewsbury and went home
after supper. She shook hands with Emily on the doorstep and told
her to be a good girl and do exactly as Aunt Ruth bade her. She did
not kiss Emily, but her tone was very gentle for Aunt Elizabeth.
Emily choked up and stood tearfully on the doorstep to watch Aunt
Elizabeth out of sight&mdash;Aunt Elizabeth going back to dear New
Moon.</p>

<p>"Come in," said Aunt Ruth, and <i>"please</i> don't slam the
door."</p>

<p>Now, Emily never slammed doors.</p>

<p>"We will wash the supper dishes," said Aunt Ruth. "You will
always do that after this. I will show you where everything is put.
I suppose Elizabeth told you I would expect you to do a few chores
for your board."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Emily briefly.</p>

<p>She did not mind doing chores, any number of them&mdash;but it
was Aunt Ruth's <i>tone.</i></p>

<p>"Of course your being here will mean a great deal of extra
expense for me," continued Aunt Ruth. "But it is only fair that we
should all contribute something to your bringing up. <i>I</i>
think, and I have always thought, that it would have been much
better to send you to Queen's to get a teacher's licence."</p>

<p>"I wanted that, too," said Emily.</p>

<p>"M&mdash;m." Aunt Ruth pursed her mouth. "So you tell me. In
that case I don't see why Elizabeth didn't send you to Queen's. She
has pampered you enough in other ways, I'm sure&mdash;I would
expect her to give in about this, too, if she thought you really
wanted it. You will sleep in the kitchen chamber. It is warmer in
winter than the other rooms. There is no gas in it but I could not
afford to let you have gas to study by in any case. You must use
candles&mdash;you can burn two at a time. I shall expect you to
keep your room neat and tidy and to be here at my exact hours for
meals. I am very particular about that. And there is another thing
you might as well understand at once. You must not bring your
friends here. I do not propose to entertain them."</p>

<p>"Not Ilse&mdash;or Perry&mdash;or Teddy?"</p>

<p>"Well, Ilse is a Burnley and a distant connection. She might
come in once in a while&mdash;I can't have her running in at all
times. From all I hear of her she isn't a very suitable companion
for you. As for the boys&mdash;certainly not. I know nothing of
Teddy Kent&mdash;and you ought to be too proud to associate with
Perry Miller."</p>

<p>"I'm too proud <i>not</i> to associate with him," retorted
Emily.</p>

<p>"Don't be pert with <i>me,</i> Em'ly. You might as well
understand right away that you are not going to have things all
your own way, <i>here,</i> as you had at New Moon. You have been
badly spoiled. But I will not have hired boys calling on my niece.
I don't know where you get your low tastes from, I'm sure. Even
your father <i>seemed</i> like a gentleman. Go upstairs and unpack
your trunk. Then do your lessons. We go to bed at nine
o'clock!"</p>

<p>Emily felt very indignant. Even Aunt Elizabeth had never dreamed
of forbidding Teddy to come to New Moon. She shut herself in her
room and unpacked drearily. The room was such an ugly one. She
hated it at sight. The door wouldn't shut tight; the slanting
ceiling was rain stained, and came down so close to the bed that
she could touch it with her hand. On the bare floor was a large
"hooked" mat which made Emily's eyes ache. It was not in Murray
taste&mdash;nor in Ruth Dutton's taste either, to be just. A
country cousin of the deceased Mr. Dutton had given it to her. The
centre, of a crude, glaring scarlet, was surrounded by scrolls of
militant orange and violent green. In the corners were bunches of
purple ferns and blue roses.</p>

<p>The woodwork was painted a hideous chocolate brown, and the
walls were covered with paper of still more hideous design. The
pictures were in keeping, especially a chromo of Queen Alexandra,
gorgeously bedizened with jewels, hung at such an angle that it
seemed the royal lady must certainly fall over on her face. Not
even a chromo could make Queen Alexandra ugly or vulgar, but it
came piteously near it. On a narrow, chocolate shelf sat a vase
filled with paper flowers that had been paper flowers for twenty
years. One couldn't believe that <i>anything</i> could be as ugly
and depressing as they were.</p>

<p>"This room is unfriendly&mdash;it&mdash;doesn't want me&mdash;I
can <i>never</i> feel at home here," said Emily.</p>

<p>She was horribly homesick. She wanted the New Moon candle-lights
shining out on the birch-trees&mdash;the scent of hop-vines in the
dew&mdash;her purring pussy cats&mdash;her own dear room, full of
dreams&mdash;the silences and shadows of the old garden&mdash;the
grand anthems of wind and billow in the gulf&mdash;that sonorous
old music she missed so much in this inland silence. She missed
even the little graveyard where slept the New Moon dead.</p>

<p>"I'm <i>not</i> going to cry." Emily clenched her hands. "Aunt
Ruth will laugh at me. There's nothing <i>in</i> this room I can
ever love. Is there anything <i>out</i> of it?"</p>

<p>She pushed up the window. It looked south into the fir grove and
its balsam blew in to her like a caress. To the left there was an
opening in the trees like a green, arched window, and one saw an
enchanting little moonlit landscape through it. And it would let in
the splendour of sunset. To the right was a view of the hill-side
along which West Shrewsbury straggled: the hill was dotted with
lights in the autumn dusk, and had a fairy-like loveliness.
Somewhere near by there was a drowsy twittering, as of little,
sleepy birds swinging on a shadowy bough.</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>this</i> is beautiful," breathed Emily, bending out to
drink in the balsam-scented air. "Father told me once that one
could find something beautiful to love <i>everywhere.</i> I'll love
this."</p>

<p>Aunt Ruth poked her head in at the door, unannounced.</p>

<p>"Em'ly, why did you leave that antimacassar crooked on the sofa
in the dining-room?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;don't&mdash;know," said Emily confusedly. She hadn't
even known she had disarranged the antimacassar. Why did Aunt Ruth
ask such a question, as if she suspected her of some dark, deep,
sinister design?</p>

<p>"Go down and put it straight."</p>

<p>As Emily turned obediently Aunt Ruth exclaimed,</p>

<p>"Em'ly Starr, put that window down at once! Are you crazy?"</p>

<p>"The room is so close," pleaded Emily.</p>

<p>"You can air it in the daytime but <i>never</i> have that window
open after sundown. <i>I</i> am responsible for your health now.
You must know that consumptives have to avoid night air and
draughts."</p>

<p>"I'm not a consumptive," cried Emily rebelliously.</p>

<p>"Contradict, of course."</p>

<p>"And if I <i>were,</i> fresh air any time is the best thing for
me. Dr. Burnley says so. I <i>hate</i> being smothered."</p>

<p>"'Young people <i>think</i> old people to be fools and old
people <i>know</i> young people to be fools.'" Aunt Ruth felt that
the proverb left nothing to be said. "Go and straighten that
antimacassar, Em'ly."</p>

<p>"Em'ly" swallowed something and went. The offending antimacassar
was mathematically corrected.</p>

<p>Emily stood for a moment and looked about her. Aunt Ruth's
dining-room was much more splendid and "up-to-date" than the
"sitting-room" at New Moon where they had "company" meals. Hardwood
floor&mdash;Wilton rug&mdash;Early English oak furniture. But it
was not half as "friendly" as the old New Moon room, Emily thought.
She was more homesick than ever. She did not believe she was going
to like <i>anything</i> in Shrewsbury&mdash;living with Aunt Ruth,
or going to school. The teachers all seemed flat and insipid after
pungent Mr. Carpenter and there was a girl in the Junior class she
had hated at sight. And she had thought it would be all so
delightful&mdash;living in pretty Shrewsbury and going to High
School. Well, nothing ever <i>is</i> exactly like what you expect
it to be, Emily told herself in temporary pessimism as she went
back to her room. Hadn't Dean told her once that he had dreamed all
his life of rowing in a gondola through the canals of Venice on a
moonlit night? And when he did he was almost eaten alive by
mosquitoes.</p>

<p>Emily set her teeth as she crept into bed.</p>

<p>"I shall just have to fix my thoughts on the moonlight and
romance and ignore the mosquitoes," she thought. "Only&mdash;Aunt
Ruth <i>does</i> sting so."</p>

<h2><a name="c07" id="c07"><i>Pot-pourri</i></a>
</h2>

<p>"September 20, 19&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have been neglecting my diary of late. One does not have a
great deal of spare time at Aunt Ruth's. But it is Friday night and
I couldn't go home for the week-end so I come to my diary for
comforting. I can spend only alternate week-ends at New Moon. Aunt
Ruth wants me every other Saturday to help 'houseclean.' We go over
this house from top to bottom whether it needs it or not, as the
tramp said when he washed his face every month, and then rest from
our labours for Sunday.</p>

<p>"There is a hint of frost in the air to-night. I am afraid the
garden at New Moon will suffer. Aunt Elizabeth will begin to think
it is time to give up the cookhouse for the season and move the
Waterloo back into the kitchen. Cousin Jimmy will be boiling the
pigs' potatoes in the old orchard and reciting his poetry. Likely
Teddy and Ilse and Perry&mdash;who have all gone home, lucky
creatures&mdash;will be there and Daff will be prowling about. But
I must not think of it. That way homesickness lies.</p>

<p>"I am beginning to like Shrewsbury and Shrewsbury school and
Shrewsbury teachers&mdash;though Dean was right when he said I
would not find anyone here like Mr. Carpenter. The Seniors and
Juniors look down on the Preps and are very condescending. Some of
them condescended to <i>me,</i> but I do not think they will try it
again&mdash;except Evelyn Blake, who condescends every time we
meet, as we do quite often, because her chum, Mary Carswell, rooms
with Ilse at Mrs. Adamson's boarding-house.</p>

<p>"I hate Evelyn Blake. There is no doubt at all about that. And
there is as little doubt that she hates me. We are instinctive
enemies&mdash;we looked at each other the first time we met like
two strange cats, and that was enough. I never really hated any one
before. I thought I did but now I know it was only dislike. Hate is
rather interesting for a change. Evelyn is a Junior&mdash;tall,
clever, rather handsome. Has long, bright, <i>treacherous</i> brown
eyes and talks through her nose. She has <i>literary ambitions,</i>
I understand, and considers herself the best dressed girl in High
School. Perhaps she is; but somehow her clothes seem to make more
impression on you than <i>she</i> does. People criticize Ilse for
dressing too richly and too <i>old</i> but <i>she dominates</i> her
clothes for all that. Evelyn doesn't. You always think of her
clothes before you think of her. The difference seems to be that
Evelyn dresses for other people and Ilse dresses for herself. I
must write a character sketch of her when I have studied her a
little more. What a satisfaction that will be!</p>

<p>"I met her first in Ilse's room and Mary Carswell introduced us.
Evelyn looked down at me&mdash;she is a little taller, being a year
older&mdash;and said,</p>

<p>"'Oh, yes, Miss Starr? I've heard my aunt, Mrs. Henry Blake,
talking about you.'</p>

<p>Mrs. Henry Blake was once Miss Brownell. I looked straight into
Evelyn's eyes and said,</p>

<p>"'No doubt Mrs. Henry Blake painted a very flattering picture of
me.'</p>

<p>"Evelyn laughed&mdash;with a kind of laugh I don't like. It
gives you the feeling that she is laughing at <i>you,</i> not at
what you've said.</p>

<p>"'You didn't get on very well with her, did you? I understand
you are quite literary. What papers do you write for?'</p>

<p>"She asked the question sweetly but she knew perfectly well that
I don't write for any&mdash;yet.</p>

<p>"'The Charlottetown <i>Enterprise</i> and the Shrewsbury
<i>Weekly Times,'</i> I said with a wicked grin. 'I've just made a
bargain with them. I'm to get two cents for every news item I send
the <i>Enterprise</i> and twenty-five cents a week for a society
letter for the <i>Times.'</i></p>

<p>"My grin worried Evelyn. Preps aren't supposed to grin like that
at Juniors. It isn't done.</p>

<p>"'Oh, yes, I understand you are working for your board,' she
said. 'I suppose every little helps. But I meant real literary
periodicals.'</p>

<p>"'<i>The Quill?'</i> I asked with another grin.</p>

<p>"<i>The Quill</i> is the High School paper, appearing monthly.
It is edited by the members of the <i>Skull and Owl,</i> a
'literary society' to which only Juniors and Seniors are eligible.
The contents of <i>The Quill</i> are written by the students and in
theory any student can contribute but in practice hardly anything
is ever accepted from a Prep. Evelyn is a Skull and Owlite and her
cousin is editor of <i>The Quill.</i> She evidently thought I was
waxing sarcastic at her expense and ignored me for the rest of her
call, except for one dear little jab when dress came up for
discussion.</p>

<p>"'I want one of the new ties,' she said. 'There are some sweet
ones at Jones and McCallum's and they are awfully smart. The little
black velvet ribbon you are wearing around your neck, Miss Starr,
is rather becoming. I used to wear one myself when they were in
style.'</p>

<p>"I couldn't think of anything clever to say in retort. I can
think of clever things so easily when there is no one to say them
to. So I said nothing but merely smiled <i>very</i> slowly and
<i>disdainfully.</i> That seemed to annoy Evelyn more than speech,
for I heard she said afterwards that 'that Emily Starr' had a very
affected smile.</p>

<p>"Note:&mdash;One can do a great deal with appropriate smiles. I
must study the subject carefully. The friendly smile&mdash;the
scornful smile&mdash;the detached smile&mdash;the entreating
smile&mdash;the common or garden grin.</p>

<p>"As for Miss Brownell&mdash;or rather Mrs. Blake&mdash;I met
<i>her</i> on the street a few days ago. After she passed she said
something to her companion and they both laughed. Very bad manners,
<i>I</i> think.</p>

<p>"I like Shrewsbury and I like school but I shall never like Aunt
Ruth's house. It has a disagreeable personality. Houses are like
people&mdash;some you like and some you don't like&mdash;and once
in a while there is one you love. Outside, this house is covered
with frippery. I feel like getting a broom and sweeping it off.
Inside, its rooms are all square and proper and soulless. Nothing
you could put into them would ever seem to belong to them. There
are no nice romantic corners in it, as there are at New Moon. My
room hasn't improved on acquaintance, either. The ceiling oppresses
me&mdash;it comes down so low over my bed&mdash;and Aunt Ruth won't
let me move the bed. She looked amazed when I suggested it.</p>

<p>"'The bed has <i>always</i> been in that corner,' she said, just
as she might have said, 'The sun has always risen in the east.'</p>

<p>"But the pictures are really the worst thing about this
room&mdash;chromos of the most aggravated description. Once I
turned them all to the wall and of course Aunt Ruth walked
in&mdash;she <i>never</i> knocks&mdash;and noticed them at
once.</p>

<p>"'Em'ly, why have you meddled with the pictures?'</p>

<p>"Aunt Ruth is always asking 'why' I do this and that. Sometimes
I can explain and sometimes I can't. This was one of the times I
couldn't. But of course I had to answer Aunt Ruth's question. No
disdainful smile would do here.</p>

<p>"'Queen Alexandra's dog collar gets on my nerves,' I said, 'and
Byron's expression on his death-bed at Missolonghi hinders me from
studying.'</p>

<p>"'Em'ly,' said Aunt Ruth, 'you might try to show a <i>little</i>
gratitude.'</p>

<p>"I wanted to say,</p>

<p>"'To whom&mdash;Queen Alexandra or Lord Byron?' but of course I
didn't. Instead I meekly turned all the pictures right side out
again.</p>

<p>"'You haven't told me the real reason why you turned those
pictures,' said Aunt Ruth sternly. 'I suppose you don't mean to
tell me. Deep and sly&mdash;deep and sly&mdash;I always said you
were. The very first time I saw you at Maywood I said you were the
slyest child I had ever seen.'</p>

<p>"'Aunt Ruth, why do you say such things to me?' I said, in
exasperation. 'Is it because you love me and want to improve
me&mdash;or hate me and want to hurt me&mdash;or just because you
can't help it?'</p>

<p>"'Miss Impertinence, please remember that this is m<i>y</i>
house. And you will leave <i>my</i> pictures alone after this. I
will forgive you for meddling with them this time but don't let it
happen again. I will find out yet your motive in turning them
around, clever as you think yourself.'</p>

<p>"Aunt Ruth stalked out but I know she listened on the landing
quite a while to find out if I would begin talking to myself. She
is always watching me&mdash;even when she says nothing&mdash;does
nothing&mdash;I know she is watching me. I feel like a little fly
under a microscope. Not a word or action escapes her criticism,
and, though she can't read my thoughts, she attributes thoughts to
me that I never had any idea of thinking. I hate that worse than
anything else.</p>

<p>"Can't I say anything good of Aunt Ruth? Of course I can.</p>

<p>"She is honest and virtuous and truthful and industrious and of
her pantry she needeth not to be ashamed. But she hasn't any
lovable virtues&mdash;and she will never give up trying to find out
why I turned the pictures. She will never believe that I told her
the simple truth.</p>

<p>"Of course, things 'might be worse.' As Teddy says, it might
have been Queen Victoria instead of Queen Alexandra.</p>

<p>"I have some pictures of my own pinned up that save
me&mdash;some lovely sketches of New Moon and the old orchard that
Teddy made for me, and an engraving Dean gave me. It is a picture
in soft, dim colours of palms around a desert well and a train of
camels passing across the sands against a black sky gemmed with
stars. It is full of lure and mystery and when I look at it I
forget Queen Alexandra's jewellery and Lord Byron's lugubrious
face, and my soul slips out&mdash;out&mdash;through a little
gateway into a great, vast world of freedom and dream.</p>

<p>"Aunt Ruth asked me where I got that picture. When I told her
she sniffed and said,</p>

<p>"'I can't understand how you have such a liking for Jarback
Priest. He's a man I've no use for.'</p>

<p>"I shouldn't think she would have.</p>

<p>"But if the house is ugly and my room unfriendly, the Land of
Uprightness is beautiful and saves my soul alive. The Land of
Uprightness is the fir grove behind the house. I call it that
because the firs are all so exceedingly tall and slender and
straight. There is a pool in it, veiled with ferns, with a big grey
boulder beside it. It is reached by a little, winding, capricious
path so narrow that only one can walk in it. When I'm tired or
lonely or angry or too ambitious I go there and sit for a few
minutes. Nobody can keep an upset mind looking at those slender,
crossed tips against the sky. I go there to study on fine evenings,
though Aunt Ruth is suspicious and thinks it is just another
manifestation of my slyness. Soon it will be dark too early to
study there and I'll be so sorry. Somehow, my books have a
<i>meaning</i> there they never have anywhere else.</p>

<p>"There are so many dear, green corners in the Land of
Uprightness, full of the aroma of sun-steeped ferns, and grassy,
open spaces where pale asters feather the grass, swaying gently
towards each other when the Wind Woman runs among them. And just to
the left of my window there is a group of tall old firs that look,
in moonlight or twilight, like a group of witches weaving spells of
sorcery. When I first saw them, one windy night against the red
sunset, with the reflection of my candle, like a weird, signal
flame, suspended in the air among their boughs, the <i>flash</i>
came&mdash;for the first time in Shrewsbury&mdash;and I felt so
happy that nothing else mattered. I have written a poem about
them.</p>

<p>"But oh, I burn to write stories. I knew it would be hard to
keep my promise to Aunt Elizabeth but I didn't know it would be
<i>so</i> hard. Every day it seems harder&mdash;such splendid ideas
for plots pop into my mind. Then I have to fall back on character
studies of the people I know. I have written several of them. I
always feel so strongly tempted to <i>touch them up a
bit</i>&mdash;deepen the shadows&mdash;bring out the highlights a
little more vividly. But I remember that I promised Aunt Elizabeth
never to write anything that wasn't true so I stay my hand and try
to paint them exactly as they are.</p>

<p>"I have written one of Aunt Ruth. Interesting but dangerous. I
never leave my Jimmy-book or my diary in my room. I know Aunt Ruth
rummages through it when I'm out. So I always carry them in my
book-bag.</p>

<p>"Ilse was up this evening and we did our lessons together. Aunt
Ruth frowns on this&mdash;and, to be strictly just, I don't know
that she is wrong. Ilse is so jolly and comical that we laugh more
than we study, I'm afraid. We don't do as well in class next
day&mdash;and besides, this house disapproves of laughter.</p>

<p>"Perry and Teddy like the High School. Perry earns his lodging
by looking after the furnace and grounds and his board by waiting
on the table. Besides, he gets twenty-five cents an hour for doing
odd jobs. I don't see much of him or Teddy, except in the week-ends
home, for it is against the school rules for boys and girls to walk
together to and from school. Lots <i>do</i> it, though. I had
several chances to but I concluded that it would not be in keeping
with New Moon traditions to break the rule. Besides, Aunt Ruth asks
me every blessed night when I come home from school if I've walked
with anybody. I think she's sometimes a little disappointed when I
say 'No.'</p>

<p>"Besides, I didn't much fancy any of the boys who wanted to walk
with me.</p>

<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

<p>"October 20, 19&mdash;</p>

<p>"My room is full of boiled cabbage smells to-night but I dare
not open my window. Too much night air outside. I would risk it for
a little while if Aunt Ruth hadn't been in a very bad humour all
day. Yesterday was my Sunday in Shrewsbury and when we went to
church I sat in the corner of the pew. I did not know that Aunt
Ruth must always sit there but she thought I did it on purpose. She
read her Bible all the afternoon. I <i>felt</i> she was reading it
<i>at</i> me, though I couldn't imagine why. This morning she asked
me why I did it.</p>

<p>"'Did what?' I said in bewilderment.</p>

<p>"'Em'ly, you know what you did. I will not tolerate this
slyness. What was your motive?'</p>

<p>"'Aunt Ruth, I haven't the slightest idea what you mean,' I
said&mdash;quite haughtily, for I felt I was not being treated
fairly.</p>

<p>"'Em'ly, you sat in the corner of the pew yesterday just to keep
me out of it. <i>Why</i> did you do it?"</p>

<p>"I looked down at Aunt Ruth&mdash;I am taller than she is now
and I can do it. She doesn't like it, either. I was angry and I
<i>think</i> I had a little of the Murray look on my face. The
whole thing seemed so contemptible to be making a fuss over.</p>

<p>"'If I did it to keep you out of it, isn't that <i>why?'</i> I
said as contemptuously as I felt. I picked up my book-bag and
stalked to the door. There I stopped. It occurred to me that,
whatever the Murrays might or might not do, I was not behaving as a
Starr should. Father wouldn't have approved of my behaviour. So I
turned and said, very politely,</p>

<p>"'I should not have spoken like that, Aunt Ruth, and I beg your
pardon. I didn't mean anything by sitting in the corner. It was
just because I happened to go into the pew first. I didn't know you
preferred the corner.'</p>

<p>"Perhaps I overdid the politeness. At any rate, my apology only
seemed to irritate Aunt Ruth the more. She sniffed and said,</p>

<p>"'I will forgive you this time, but don't let it happen again.
Of course I didn't expect you would tell me your reason. You are
too sly for that.'</p>

<p>"Aunt Ruth, Aunt Ruth! If you keep on calling me sly you'll
drive me into being sly in reality and <i>then</i> watch out. If I
choose to be sly I can twist you round my finger! It's only because
I'm straightforward that you can manage me at all.</p>

<p>"I have to go to bed every night at nine o'clock&mdash;'people
who are threatened with consumption require a great deal of sleep.'
When I come from school there are chores to be done and I must
study in the evenings. So I haven't a moment of time for writing
anything. I know Aunt Elizabeth and Aunt Ruth have had a conference
on the subject. But I <i>have</i> to write. So I get up in the
morning as soon as it is daylight, dress, and put on a
coat&mdash;for the mornings are cold now&mdash;sit down and
scribble for a priceless hour. I didn't choose that Aunt Ruth
should discover it and call me sly so I told her I was doing it.
She gave me to understand that I was mentally unsound and would
make a bad end in some asylum, but she didn't actually forbid
me&mdash;probably because she thought it would be of no use. It
wouldn't. I've <i>got</i> to write, that is all there is to it.
That hour in the grey morning is the most delightful one in the day
for me.</p>

<p>"Lately, being forbidden to write stories, I've been
<i>thinking</i> them out. But one day it struck me that I was
breaking my compact with Aunt Elizabeth in spirit if not in letter.
So I have stopped it.</p>

<p>"I wrote a character study of Ilse to-day. Very fascinating. It
is difficult to analyse her. She is so different and unexpectable.
(I coined that word myself.) She doesn't even get mad like anybody
else. I enjoy her tantrums. She doesn't say so many awful things in
them as she used to but she is <i>piquant.</i> (Piquant is a new
word for me. I like using a new word. I never think I really own a
word until I've spoken or written it.)</p>

<p>"I am writing by my window. I love to watch the Shrewsbury
lights twinkle out in the dusk over that long hill.</p>

<p>"I had a letter from Dean to-day. He is in Egypt&mdash;among
ruined shrines of old gods and the tombs of old kings. I saw that
strange land through his eyes&mdash;I seemed to go back with him
through the old centuries&mdash;I knew the magic of its skies. I
was Emily of Karnak or Thebes&mdash;not Emily of Shrewsbury at all.
That is a trick Dean has.</p>

<p>"Aunt Ruth insisted on seeing his letter and when she read it
she said it was impious!</p>

<p>"I should never have thought of that adjective.</p>

<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

<p>"October 21, 19&mdash;</p>

<p>"I climbed the steep little wooded hill in the Land of
Uprightness to-night and had an exultation on its crest. There's
always something satisfying in climbing to the top of a hill. There
was a fine tang of frost in the air, the view over Shrewsbury
Harbour was very wonderful, and the woods all about me were
expecting something to happen soon&mdash;at least that is the only
way I can describe the effect they had on me. I forgot
<i>everything</i>&mdash;Aunt Ruth's stings and Evelyn Blake's
patronage and Queen Alexandra's dog collar&mdash;everything in life
that isn't just right. Lovely thoughts came flying to meet me like
birds. They weren't <i>my</i> thoughts. I couldn't think anything
half so exquisite. They <i>came</i> from somewhere.</p>

<p>"Coming back, on that dark little path, where the air was full
of nice, whispering sounds, I heard a chuckle of laughter in a fir
copse just behind me. I was startled&mdash;and a little bit
alarmed. I knew at once it wasn't human laughter&mdash;it was more
like the Puckish mirth of fairy folk, with just a faint hint of
malice in it. I can no longer believe in wood elves&mdash;alas, one
loses so much when one becomes incredulous&mdash;so this laughter
puzzled me&mdash;and, yes, a horrid, crawly feeling began in my
spine. Then, suddenly, I thought of owls and knew it for what it
was&mdash;a truly delightful sound, as if some survival of the
Golden Age were chuckling to himself there in the dark. There were
two of them, I think, and they were certainly having a good time
over some owlish joke. I must write a poem about it&mdash;though
I'll never be able to put into words half the charm and devilry of
it.</p>

<p>"Ilse was up on the carpet in the principal's room yesterday for
walking home from school with Guy Lindsay. Something Mr. Hardy said
made her so furious that she snatched up a vase of chrysanthemums
that was on his desk and hurled it against the wall, where of
course it was smashed to pieces.</p>

<p>"'If I hadn't thrown it at the wall I'd have had to have thrown
it at <i>you,'</i> she told him.</p>

<p>"It would have gone hard with some girls but Mr. Hardy is a
friend of Dr. Burnley's. Besides, there is something about those
yellow eyes of Ilse's that do things to you. I know exactly how she
would look at Mr. Hardy after she had smashed the vase. All her
rage would be gone and her eyes would be laughing and
daring&mdash;impudent, Aunt Ruth would call it. Mr. Hardy merely
told her she was acting like a baby and would have to pay for the
vase, since it was school property. That rather squelched Ilse; she
thought it a tame ending to her heroics.</p>

<p>"I scolded her roundly. Really, somebody <i>has</i> to bring
Ilse up and nobody but me seems to feel any responsibility in the
matter. Dr. Burnley will just roar with laughter when she tells
him. But I might as well have scolded the Wind Woman. Ilse just
laughed and hugged me.</p>

<p>"'Honey, it made such a jolly smash. When I heard it I wasn't a
bit mad any more.'</p>

<p>"Ilse recited at our school concert last week and everybody
thought her wonderful.</p>

<p>"Aunt Ruth told me to-day that she expected me to be a star
pupil. She wasn't punning on my name&mdash;oh, no, Aunt Ruth hasn't
a nodding acquaintance with puns. All the pupils who make ninety
per cent average at the Christmas exams and do not fall below
eighty in any subject are called 'Star' pupils and are given a gold
star-pin to wear for the rest of the term. It is a coveted
distinction and of course not many win it. If I fail Aunt Ruth will
rub it in to the bone. I must <i>not</i> fail.</p>

<p>"October 30, 19&mdash;</p>

<p>"The November <i>Quill</i> came out to-day. I sent my owl poem
in to the editor a week ago but he didn't use is. And he <i>did</i>
use one of Evelyn Blake's&mdash;a silly, simpering little rhyme
about <i>Autumn Leaves</i>&mdash;very much the sort of thing
<i>I</i> wrote three years ago.</p>

<p>"And Evelyn <i>condoled</i> with me before the whole roomful of
girls because <i>my</i> poem hadn't been taken. I suppose Tom Blake
had told her about it.</p>

<p>"'You mustn't feel badly about it, Miss Starr. Tom said it
wasn't half bad but of course not up to <i>The Quill's</i>
standard. Likely in another year or two you'll be able to get in.
Keep on trying.'</p>

<p>"'Thanks,' I said. 'I'm not feeling badly. Why should I? I
didn't make "beam" rhyme with "green" in my poem. If I had I'd be
feeling very badly indeed.'</p>

<p>"Evelyn coloured to her eyes.</p>

<p>"'Don't show your disappointment so plainly, <i>child,'</i> she
said.</p>

<p>"But I noticed she dropped the subject after that.</p>

<p>"For my own satisfaction I wrote a criticism of Evelyn's poem in
my Jimmy-book as soon as I came from school. I modelled it on
Macaulay's essay on poor Robert Montgomery, and I got so much fun
out of it that I didn't feel sore and humiliated any more. I must
show it to Mr. Carpenter when I go home. He'll chuckle over it.</p>

<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

<p>"November 6, 19&mdash;</p>

<p>"I noticed this evening in glancing over my journal that I soon
gave up recording my good and bad deeds. I suppose it was because
so many of my doings were half-and-half. I never could decide in
what class they belonged.</p>

<p>"We are expected to answer roll-call with a quotation on Monday
mornings. This morning I repeated a verse from my own poem <i>A
Window that Faces the Sea.</i> When I left Assembly to go down to
the Prep classroom Miss Aylmer, the Vice-Principal, stopped me.</p>

<p>"'Emily, that was a beautiful verse you gave at roll-call. Where
did you get it? And do you know the whole poem?'</p>

<p>"I was so elated I could hardly answer,</p>

<p>"'Yes, Miss Aylmer,' <i>very</i> demurely.</p>

<p>"'I would like a copy of it,' said Miss Aylmer. 'Could you write
me off one? And who is the author?'</p>

<p>"'The author,' I said laughing, 'is Emily Byrd Starr. The truth
is, Miss Aylmer, that I forgot to look up a quotation for roll-call
and couldn't think of any in a hurry, so just fell back on a bit of
my own.'</p>

<p>"Miss Aylmer didn't say anything for a moment. She just looked
at me. She is a stout, middle-aged woman with a square face and
nice, wide, grey eyes.</p>

<p>"'Do you still want the poem, Miss Aylmer?' I said, smiling.</p>

<p>"'Yes,' she said, still looking at me in that funny way, as if
she had never seen me before. 'Yes&mdash;and autograph it,
please.'</p>

<p>"I promised and went on down the stairs. At the foot I glanced
back. She was still looking after me. Something in her look made me
feel glad and proud and happy and
humble&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;<i>prayerful.</i> Yes, that was
just how I felt.</p>

<p>"Oh, this has been a wonderful day. What care I now for <i>The
Quill</i> or Evelyn Blake?</p>

<p>"This evening Aunt Ruth marched up town to see Uncle Oliver's
Andrew, who is in the bank here now. She made me go along. She gave
Andrew lots of good advice about his morals and his meals and his
underclothes and asked him to come down for an evening whenever he
wished. Andrew is a Murray, you see, and can therefore rush in
where Teddy and Perry dare not tread. He is quite good-looking,
with straight, well-groomed, red hair. But he always looks as if
he'd just been starched and ironed.</p>

<p>"I thought the evening not wholly wasted, for Mrs. Garden, his
landlady, has an interesting cat who made certain advances to me.
But when Andrew patted him and called him 'Poor pussy' the
intelligent animal hissed at him.</p>

<p>"'You mustn't be too familiar with a cat,' I advised Andrew.
'And you must speak respectfully <i>to</i> and <i>of</i> him.'</p>

<p>"'Piffle!' said Aunt Ruth.</p>

<p>"But a cat's a cat for a' that.</p>

<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

<p>"November 8, 19&mdash;</p>

<p>"The nights are cold now. When I came back Monday I brought one
of the New Moon gin jars for my comforting. I cuddle down with it
in bed and enjoy the contrasting roars of the storm wind outside in
the Land of Uprightness, and the rain whirling over the room. Aunt
Ruth worries for fear the cork will come out and deluge the bed.
That would be almost as bad as what really did happen night before
last. I woke up about midnight with the most wonderful idea for a
story. I felt that I must rise at once and jot it down in a
Jimmy-book before I forgot it. Then I could keep it until my three
years are up and I am free to write it.</p>

<p>"I hopped out of bed and, in pawing around my table to find my
candle, I upset my ink-bottle. Then of course I went mad and
couldn't find <i>anything!</i>
Matches&mdash;candles&mdash;everything had disappeared. I set the
ink-bottle up, but I knew there was a pool of ink on the table. I
had ink all over my fingers and dare not touch anything in the dark
and couldn't find anything to wipe it off. And all the time I heard
that ink drip-dripping on the floor.</p>

<p>"In desperation I opened the door&mdash;with my <i>toes</i>
because I dare not touch it with my inky hands&mdash;and went
downstairs where I wiped my hands on the stove rag and got some
matches. But this time, of course, Aunt Ruth was up, demanding whys
and motives. She took my matches, lighted her candle, and marched
me upstairs. Oh, 'twas a gruesome sight! How could a small stone
ink-bottle hold a quart of ink? There <i>must</i> have been a quart
to have made the mess it did.</p>

<p>"I felt like the old Scotch emigrant who came home one evening,
found his house burned down and his entire family scalped by
Indians and said, 'This is pairfectly redeeclous.' The table cover
was ruined&mdash;the carpet was soaked&mdash;even the wall-paper
was bespattered. But Queen Alexandra smiled benignly over all and
Byron went on dying.</p>

<p>"Aunt Ruth and I had an hour's seance with salt and vinegar.
Aunt Ruth wouldn't believe me when I said I got up to jot down the
plot of a story. She knew I had some other motive and it was just
some more of my deepness and slyness. She also said a few other
things which I won't write down. Of course I deserved a scolding
for leaving that ink-bottle uncorked; but I <i>didn't</i> deserve
all she said. However, I took it all very meekly. For one thing I
<i>had</i> been careless: and for another I had my bedroom shoes
on. Anyone can overcrow me when I'm wearing bedroom shoes. Then she
wound up by saying she would forgive me this time, but it was not
to happen again.</p>

<p>"Perry won the mile race in the school sports and broke the
record. He bragged too much about it and Ilse raged at him.</p>

<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

<p>"November 11, 19&mdash;</p>

<p>"Last night Aunt Ruth found me reading <i>David Copperfield</i>
and crying over <i>Davy's</i> alienation from his mother, with a
black rage against <i>Mr. Murdstone</i> in my heart. She must know
<i>why</i> I was crying and wouldn't believe me when I told
her.</p>

<p>"'Crying over people who never existed!' said my Aunt Ruth
incredulously.</p>

<p>"'Oh, but they <i>do</i> exist,' I said. 'Why, they are as real
as <i>you</i> are, Aunt Ruth. Do you mean to say that Miss Betsy
Trotwood is a delusion?'</p>

<p>"I thought perhaps I could have <i>real</i> tea when I came to
Shrewsbury, but Aunt Ruth says it is not healthy. So I drink cold
water for I will <i>not</i> drink cambric tea any longer. As if I
were a child!</p>

<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

<p>"November 30, 19&mdash;</p>

<p>"Andrew was in to-night. He always comes the Friday night I
don't go to New Moon. Aunt Ruth left us alone in the parlour and
went out to a meeting of the Ladies' Aid. Andrew, being a Murray,
can be trusted.</p>

<p>"I don't dislike Andrew. It would be impossible to dislike so
harmless a being. He is one of those good, talkative, awkward dears
who goad you irresistibly into tormenting them. Then you feel
remorseful afterwards because they <i>are</i> so good.</p>

<p>"To-night, Aunt Ruth being out, I tried to discover how little I
could really say to Andrew, while I pursued my own train of
thought. I discovered that I could get along with very few
words&mdash;'Yes'&mdash;'No'&mdash;in several inflections, with or
without a little laugh&mdash;'I don't
know'&mdash;'Really?'&mdash;'Well, well'&mdash;'How
wonderful!'&mdash;especially the last. Andrew talked on, and when
he stopped for breath I stuck in 'How wonderful.' I did it exactly
eleven times. Andrew liked it. I know it gave him a nice,
flattering feeling that <i>he</i> was wonderful, and his
conversation wonderful. Meanwhile I was living a splendid imaginary
dream-life by the River of Egypt in the days of Thotmes I.</p>

<p>"So we were both very happy. I think I'll try it again. Andrew
is too stupid to catch me at it.</p>

<p>"When Aunt Ruth came home she asked, 'Well, how did you and
Andrew get along?'</p>

<p>"She asks that every time he comes down. I <i>know why.</i> I
know the little scheme that is understood among the Murrays, even
though I don't believe any of them have ever put it into words.</p>

<p>"'Beautifully,' I said. 'Andrew is improving. He said <i>one</i>
interesting thing to-night, and he hadn't so many feet and hands as
usual.'</p>

<p>"I don't know <i>why</i> I say things like that to Aunt Ruth
occasionally. It would be so much better for me if I didn't. But
<i>something</i>&mdash;whether it's Murray or Starr or Shipley or
Burnley, or just pure cussedness I know not&mdash;<i>makes</i> me
say them before I've time to reflect.</p>

<p>"'No doubt you would find more congenial company in Stovepipe
Town,' said Aunt Ruth.</p>

<h2><a name="c08" id="c08"><i>Not Proven</i></a>
</h2>

<p>Emily regretfully left the "Booke Shoppe," where the aroma of
books and new magazines was as the savour of sweet incense in her
nostrils, and hastened down cold and blustery Prince Street.
Whenever possible she slipped into the Booke Shoppe and took hungry
dips into magazines she could not afford to buy, avid to learn what
kind of stuff they published&mdash;especially poetry. She could not
see that many of the verses in them were any better than some of
her own, yet editors sent hers back religiously. Emily had already
used a considerable portion of the American stamps she had bought
with Cousin Jimmy's dollar in paying the homeward way of her
fledgelings, accompanied by only the cold comfort of rejection
slips. Her <i>Owl's Laughter</i> had already been returned six
times, but Emily had not wholly lost faith in it yet. That very
morning she had dropped it again into the letter-box at the
Shoppe.</p>

<p>"The seventh time brings luck," she thought as she turned down
the street leading to Ilse's boarding-house. She had her
examination in English at eleven o'clock and she wanted to glance
over Ilse's note-book before she went for it. The Preps were almost
through their terminal examinations, taking them by fits and starts
when the class-rooms were free from Seniors and Juniors&mdash;a
thing that always made the Preps furious. Emily felt comfortably
certain she would get her star pin. The examinations in her hardest
subjects were over and she did not believe she had fallen below
eighty in any of them. To-day was English, in which she ought to go
well over ninety. Remained only history, which she also loved.
Everybody expected her to win the star pin. Cousin Jimmy was
intensely excited over it, and Dean had sent her premature
congratulations from the top of a pyramid, so sure was he of her
success. His letter had come the previous day, along with the
packet containing his Christmas gift.</p>

<p>"I send you a little gold necklace that was taken from the mummy
of a dead princess of the nineteenth dynasty," wrote Dean. "Her
name was Mena and it said in her epitaph that she was 'sweet of
heart.' So I think she fared well in the Hall of Judgment and that
the dread old gods smiled indulgently upon her. This little amulet
lay on her dead breast for thousands of years. I send it to you
weighted with centuries of love. I think it must have been a love
gift. Else why should it have rested on her heart all this time? It
must have been her own choice. Others would have put a finer thing
on the neck of a king's daughter."</p>

<p>The little trinket intrigued Emily with its charm and mystery,
yet she was almost afraid of it. She gave a slight ghostly shudder
as she clasped it around her slim white throat and wondered about
the royal girl who had worn it in those days of a dead empire. What
was its history and its secret?</p>

<p>Naturally Aunt Ruth had disapproved. What business had Emily to
be getting Christmas presents from Jarback Priest?</p>

<p>"At least he might have sent you something <i>new</i> if he had
to send anything," she said.</p>

<p>"A souvenir of Cairo, made in Germany," suggested Emily
gravely.</p>

<p>"Something like that," agreed Aunt Ruth unsuspiciously. "Mrs.
Ayers has a handsome, gold-mounted glass paper-weight with a
picture of the Sphinx in it that her brother brought <i>her</i>
from Egypt. That battered thing looks positively cheap."</p>

<p>"Cheap! Aunt Ruth, do you realize that this necklace was made by
hand and worn by an Egyptian princess before the days of
Moses?"</p>

<p>"Oh, well&mdash;if you want to believe Jarback Priest's fairy
tales," said Aunt Ruth, much amused. "I wouldn't wear it in public
if I were you, Em'ly. The Murrays never wear shabby jewellery.
You're not going to leave it on to-night, child?"</p>

<p>"Of course I am. The last time it was worn was probably at the
court of Pharaoh in the days of the oppression. Now, it will go to
Kit Barrett's snow-shoe dance. What a difference! I hope the ghost
of Princess Mena won't haunt me to-night. She may resent my
sacrilege&mdash;who knows? But it was not <i>I</i> who rifled her
tomb, and somebody would have this if I didn't&mdash;somebody who
mightn't think of the little princess at all. I'm sure she would
rather that it was warm and shining about my neck than in some grim
museum for thousands of curious, cold eyes to stare at. She was
'sweet of heart,' Dean says&mdash;she won't grudge me her pretty
pendant. Lady of Egypt, whose kingdom has been poured on the desert
sands like spilled wine, I salute you across the gulf of time."</p>

<p>Emily bowed deeply and waved her hand adown the vistas of dead
centuries.</p>

<p>"Such high-falutin' language is very foolish," sniffed Aunt
Ruth.</p>

<p>"Oh, most of that last sentence was a quotation from Dean's
letter," said Emily candidly.</p>

<p>"Sounds like him," was Aunt Ruth's contemptuous agreement.
"Well, <i>I</i> think your Venetian beads would be better than that
heathenish-looking thing. Now, mind you don't stay too late, Em'ly.
Make Andrew bring you home not later than twelve."</p>

<p>Emily was going with Andrew to Kitty Barrett's dance&mdash;a
privilege quite graciously accorded since Andrew was one of the
elect people. Even when she did not get home until one o'clock Aunt
Ruth overlooked it. But it left Emily rather sleepy for the day,
especially as she had studied late the two previous nights. Aunt
Ruth relaxed her rigid rules in examination time and permitted an
extra allowance of candles. What she would have said had she known
that Emily used some of the extra candle-light to write a poem on
<i>Shadows</i> I do not know and cannot record. But no doubt she
would have considered it an added proof of slyness. Perhaps it was
sly. Remember that I am only Emily's biographer, not her
apologist.</p>

<p>Emily found Evelyn Blake in Ilse's room and Evelyn Blake was
secretly much annoyed because <i>she</i> had not been invited to
the snowshoe dance and Emily Starr had. Therefore Evelyn, sitting
on Ilse's table and swinging her high, silken-sheathed instep
flauntingly in the face of girls who had no silk stockings, was
prepared to be disagreeable.</p>

<p>"I'm glad you've come, trusty and well-beloved," moaned Ilse.
"Evelyn has been clapper-clawing me all the morning. Perhaps she'll
whirl in at you now and give me a rest."</p>

<p>"I have been telling her that she should learn to control her
temper," said Evelyn virtuously. "Don't you agree with me, Miss
Starr?"</p>

<p>"What have you been doing now, Ilse?" asked Emily.</p>

<p>"Oh, I had a large quarrel with Mrs. Adamson this morning. It
was bound to come sooner or later. I've been good so long there was
an awful lot of wickedness bottled up in me. Mary knew that, didn't
you, Mary? Mary felt quite sure an explosion was due to happen.
Mrs. Adamson began it by asking disagreeable questions. She's
always doing that&mdash;isn't she, Mary? After that she started in
scolding&mdash;and finally she cried. <i>Then</i> I slapped her
face."</p>

<p>"You see," said Evelyn, significantly.</p>

<p>"I couldn't help it," grinned Ilse. "I could have endured her
impertinence and her scolding&mdash;but when she began to
cry&mdash;she's so <i>ugly</i> when she cries&mdash;well, I just
slapped her."</p>

<p>"I suppose you felt better after that," said Emily, determined
not to show any disapproval before Evelyn.</p>

<p>Ilse burst out laughing.</p>

<p>"Yes, at first. It stopped her yowling, anyway. But afterwards
came remorse. I'll apologize to her, of course. I <i>do</i> feel
real sorry&mdash;but I'm quite likely to do it again. If Mary here
weren't so good I wouldn't be half as bad. I have to even the
balance up a bit. Mary is meek and humble and Mrs. Adamson walks
all over her. You should hear her scold Mary if Mary goes out more
than one evening a week."</p>

<p>"She is right," said Evelyn. "It would be much better if
<i>you</i> went out less. You're getting talked about, Ilse."</p>

<p>"You weren't out last night, anyhow, were you, dear?" asked Ilse
with another unholy grin.</p>

<p>Evelyn coloured and was haughtily silent. Emily buried herself
in her note-book and Mary and Ilse went out. Emily wished Evelyn
would go, too. But Evelyn had no intention of going.</p>

<p>"Why don't you make Ilse behave herself?" she began in a
hatefully confidential sort of way.</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> have no authority over Ilse," said Emily coldly.
"Besides, I don't think she misbehaves."</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear girl&mdash;why, you heard her yourself saying she
slapped Mrs. Adamson."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Adamson <i>needed</i> it. She's an odious
woman&mdash;<i>always</i> crying when there's no need in the world
for her to cry. There's nothing more aggravating."</p>

<p>"Well, Ilse skipped French <i>again</i> yesterday afternoon and
went for a walk up-river with Ronnie Gibson. If she does that too
often she's going to get caught."</p>

<p>"Ilse is very popular with the boys," said Emily, who knew that
Evelyn wanted to be.</p>

<p>"She's popular in the wrong quarters." Evelyn was condescending
now, knowing by instinct that Emily Starr hated to be condescended
to. "She always has a ruck of wild boys after her&mdash;the nice
ones don't bother with her, you notice."</p>

<p>"Ronnie Gibson's nice, isn't he?"</p>

<p>"Well, what do you say to Marshall Orde?"</p>

<p>"Ilse has nothing to do with Marshall Orde."</p>

<p>"Oh, hasn't she! She was driving with him till twelve o'clock
last Tuesday night&mdash;and he was drunk when he got the horse
from the livery stable."</p>

<p>"I don't believe a word of it! Ilse never went driving with
Marsh Orde." Emily was white-lipped with indignation.</p>

<p>"I was told by a person who <i>saw</i> them. Ilse is being
talked about <i>everywhere.</i> Perhaps you have no authority over
her but surely you have some <i>influence.</i> Though <i>you</i> do
foolish things yourself sometimes, don't you? Not meaning any harm
perhaps. That time you went bathing on the Blair Water sands
without any clothes on, for instance? <i>That's</i> known all
through the school. I heard Marsh's brother laughing about it. Now,
<i>wasn't</i> that foolish, my dear?"</p>

<p>Emily blushed with anger and shame&mdash;though quite as much
over being my-deared by Evelyn Blake as anything else. That
beautiful bathing by moonlight&mdash;what a thing of desecration it
had been made by the world! She would <i>not</i> discuss it with
Evelyn&mdash;she would not even tell Evelyn they had their
petticoats on. Let her think what she would.</p>

<p>"I don't think you quite understand some things, Miss Blake,"
she said, with a certain fine, detached irony of tone and manner
which made very commonplace words seem charged, with meanings
unutterable.</p>

<p>"Oh, you belong to the Chosen People, don't you?" Evelyn laughed
her malicious little laugh.</p>

<p>"I do," said Emily calmly, refusing to withdraw her eyes from
her note-book.</p>

<p>"Well, don't get so vexed, dear. I only spoke because I thought
it a pity to see poor Ilse getting in wrong everywhere. I rather
like her, poor soul. And I wish she would tone down her taste in
colours a bit. That scarlet evening dress she wore at the Prep
concert&mdash;really, you know, it's weird."</p>

<p>"She looked like a tall golden lily in a scarlet sheath,
<i>I</i> thought," said Emily.</p>

<p>"What a loyal friend you are, dear. I wonder if Ilse would stand
up for <i>you</i> like that. Well, I suppose I ought to let you
study. You have English at ten, haven't you? Mr. Scoville is going
to watch the room&mdash;Mr. Travers is sick. Don't you think Mr.
Scoville's hair is wonderful? Speaking of hair, dear, why don't you
dress yours low enough at the sides to hide your ears&mdash;the
tips, anyway? I think it would become you so much better."</p>

<p>Emily decided that if Evelyn Blake called her "dear" again she
would throw an ink-bottle at her. <i>Why</i> didn't she go away and
let her study?</p>

<p>Evelyn had another shot in her locker.</p>

<p>"That callow young friend of yours from Stovepipe Town has been
trying to get into <i>The Quill.</i> He sent in a patriotic poem.
Tom showed it to me. It was a scream. One line especially was
delicious&mdash;'Canada, like a <i>maiden,</i> welcomes back her
sons.' You should have heard Tom howl."</p>

<p>Emily could hardly help smiling herself, though she was horribly
annoyed with Perry for making such a target of himself. <i>Why</i>
couldn't he learn his limitations and understand that the slopes of
Parnassus were not for him?</p>

<p>"I do not think the editor of <i>The Quill</i> has any business
to show rejected contributions to outsiders," she said coldly.</p>

<p>"Oh, Tom doesn't look on <i>me</i> as an outsider. And that
really <i>was</i> too good to keep. Well, I think I'll run down to
the Shoppe."</p>

<p>Emily sighed with relief as Evelyn took her departure. Presently
Ilse returned.</p>

<p>"Evelyn gone? Sweet temper she was in this morning. I can't
understand what Mary sees in her. Mary's a decent sort though she
isn't exciting."</p>

<p>"Ilse," said Emily seriously. "Were you out driving with Marsh
Orde one night last week?"</p>

<p>Ilse stared.</p>

<p>"No, you dear young ass, I wasn't. I can guess where you heard
<i>that</i> yarn. I don't know who the girl was."</p>

<p>"But you cut French and went up-river with Ronnie Gibson?"</p>

<p>"Peccavi."</p>

<p>"Ilse&mdash;you shouldn't&mdash;really&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Now, don't make me mad, Emily!" said Ilse shortly. "You're
getting too smug&mdash;something ought to be done to cure you
before it gets chronic. I hate prunes and prisms. I'm off&mdash;I
want to run round to the Shoppe before I go to the school."</p>

<p>Ilse gathered up her books pettishly and flounced out. Emily
yawned and decided she was through with the note-book. She had half
an hour yet before it was necessary to go to the school. She would
lie down on Ilse's bed for just a moment.</p>

<p>It seemed the next minute when she found herself sitting up,
staring with dismayed face at Mary Carswell's clock. Five minutes
to eleven&mdash;five minutes to cover a quarter of a mile and be at
her desk for examination. Emily flung on coat and cap, caught up
her note-books and fled. She arrived at the High School out of
breath, with a nasty subconsciousness that people had looked at her
queerly as she tore through the streets, hung up her wraps without
a glance at the mirror, and hurried into the class-room.</p>

<p>A stare of amazement followed by a ripple of laughter went over
the room. Mr. Scoville, tall, slim, elegant, was giving out the
examination papers. He laid one down before Emily and said
gravely,</p>

<p>"Did you look in your mirror before you came to class, Miss
Starr?"</p>

<p>"No," said Emily resentfully, sensing something fearfully wrong
somewhere.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;think&mdash;I would look&mdash;now&mdash;if I
were&mdash;you." Mr. Scoville seemed to be speaking with
difficulty.</p>

<p>Emily got up and went back to the girls' dressing-room. She met
Principal Hardy in the Hall and Principal Hardy stared at her. Why
Principal Hardy stared&mdash;why the Preps had laughed&mdash;Emily
understood when she confronted the dressing-room looking-glass.</p>

<p>Drawn skilfully and blackly across her upper lip and her cheeks
was a moustache&mdash;a flamboyant, very black moustache, with
fantastically curled ends. For a moment Emily gaped at herself in
blank horror&mdash;why&mdash;what&mdash;<i>who</i> had done it?</p>

<p>She whirled furiously about. Evelyn Blake had just entered the
room.</p>

<p><i>"You</i>&mdash;you did this!" panted Emily.</p>

<p>Evelyn stared for a moment&mdash;then went off into a peal of
laughter.</p>

<p>"Emily Starr! You look like a nightmare. Do you mean to tell me
you went into class with <i>that</i> on your face?"</p>

<p>Emily clenched her hands.</p>

<p><i>"You</i> did it," she said again.</p>

<p>Evelyn drew herself up very haughtily.</p>

<p>"Really, Miss Starr, I hope you don't think I'd <i>stoop</i> to
such a trick. I suppose your dear friend Ilse thought she'd play a
joke on you&mdash;she was chuckling over something when she came in
a few minutes ago."</p>

<p>"Ilse never did it," cried Emily.</p>

<p>Evelyn shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>"I'd wash it off first and find out who did it afterward," she
said with a twitching face as she went out</p>

<p>Emily, trembling from head to foot with anger, shame and the
most intense humiliation she had ever suffered, washed the
moustache off her face. Her first impulse was to go home&mdash;she
could not face that roomful of Preps again. Then she set her teeth
and went back, holding her black head very high as she walked down
the aisle to her desk. Her face was burning and her spirit was
aflame. In the corner she saw Ilse's yellow head bent over her
paper. The others were smiling and tittering. Mr. Scoville was
insultingly grave. Emily took up her pen but her hand shook over
her paper.</p>

<p>If she could have had a good cry there and then her shame and
anger would have found a saving vent. But that was impossible. She
would <i>not</i> cry. She would not let them see the depths of her
humiliation. If Emily could have laughed off the malicious joke it
would have been better for her. Being Emily&mdash;and being one of
the proud Murrays&mdash;she could not. She resented the indignity
to the very core of her passionate soul.</p>

<p>As far as the English paper was concerned she might almost as
well have gone home. She had lost twenty minutes already. It was
ten minutes more before she could steady her hand sufficiently to
write. Her thoughts she could not command at all. The paper was a
difficult one, as Mr. Travers' papers always were. Her mind seemed
a chaos of jostling ideas spinning around a fixed point of
torturing shame. When she handed in her paper and left the
class-room she knew she had lost her star. That paper would be no
more than a pass, if it were that. But in her turmoil of feeling
she did not care. She hurried home to her unfriendly room, thankful
that Aunt Ruth was out, threw herself on the bed and wept. She felt
sore, beaten, bruised&mdash;and under all her pain was a horrible,
teasing little doubt.</p>

<p>Did Ilse do it&mdash;no, she <i>didn't</i>&mdash;she
<i>couldn't</i> have. Who then? Mary? The idea was absurd. It must
have been Evelyn&mdash;Evelyn had come back and played that cruel
trick on her out of spite and pique. Yet she had denied it, with
seemingly insulted indignation, and eyes that were perhaps a shade
too innocent. <i>What</i> had Ilse said&mdash;"You are getting
positively smug&mdash;something ought to be done to cure you before
it gets chronic." Had Ilse taken that abominable way of curing
her?</p>

<p>"No&mdash;no&mdash;no!" Emily sobbed fiercely into her pillow.
But the doubt persisted.</p>

<p>Aunt Ruth had no doubt. Aunt Ruth was calling on her friend,
Mrs. Ball, and her friend, Mrs. Ball, had a daughter who was a
Prep. Anita Ball came home with the tale that had been well laughed
over in Prep and Junior and Senior classes, and Anita Ball said
that Evelyn Blake had said Ilse Burnley had done the deed.</p>

<p>"Well," said Aunt Ruth, invading Emily's room on her return
home, "I hear Ilse Burnley decorated you beautifully to-day. I hope
you realize what she is now."</p>

<p>"Ilse didn't do it," said Emily.</p>

<p>"Have you asked her?"</p>

<p>"No. I wouldn't insult her with such a question."</p>

<p>"Well, I believe she did do it. And she is not to come here
again. Understand that."</p>

<p>"Aunt Ruth&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You've heard what I said, Em'ly. Ilse Burnley is no fit
associate for you. I've heard too many tales about her lately. But
this is unpardonable."</p>

<p>"Aunt Ruth, if I ask Ilse if she did it and she says she did
not, won't you believe her?"</p>

<p>"No, I wouldn't believe any girl brought up as Ilse Burnley was.
It's my belief she'd do anything and say anything. Don't let me see
her in my house again."</p>

<p>Emily stood up and tried to summon the Murray look into a face
distorted by weeping.</p>

<p>"Of course, Aunt Ruth," she said coldly, "I won't bring Ilse
here if she is not welcome. But I shall go to see her. And if you
forbid me&mdash;I'll&mdash;I'll go home to New Moon. I feel as if I
wanted to go anyhow now. Only&mdash;I <i>won't</i> let Evelyn Blake
drive me away."</p>

<p>Aunt Ruth knew quite well that the New Moon folks would not
agree to a complete divorce between Emily and Ilse. They were too
good friends with the doctor for that. Mrs. Dutton had never liked
Dr. Burnley. She had to be content with the excuse for keeping Ilse
away from her house, for which she had long hankered. Her own
annoyance over the matter was not born out of any sympathy with
Emily but solely from anger at a Murray being made ridiculous.</p>

<p>"I would have thought you'd had enough of going to see Ilse. As
for Evelyn Blake, she is too clever and sensible a girl to have
played a silly trick like that. I know the Blakes. They are an
excellent family and Evelyn's father is well-to-do. Now, stop
crying. A pretty face you've got. What sense is there in
crying?"</p>

<p>"None at all," agreed Emily drearily, "only I can't help it. I
can't <i>bear</i> to be made ridiculous. I can endure anything but
that. Oh, Aunt Ruth, <i>please</i> leave me alone. I can't eat any
supper."</p>

<p>"You've got yourself all worked up&mdash;Starr-like. We Murrays
conceal our feelings."</p>

<p>"I don't believe you've any to conceal&mdash;some of you,"
thought Emily rebelliously.</p>

<p>"Keep away from Ilse Burnley after this, and you'll not be so
likely to be publicly disgraced," was Aunt Ruth's parting
advice.</p>

<p>Emily, after a sleepless night&mdash;during which it seemed to
her that if she couldn't push that ceiling farther from her face
she would surely smother&mdash;went to see Ilse the next day and
reluctantly told her what Aunt Ruth had said. Ilse was
furious&mdash;but Emily noted with a pang that she did not assert
any innocence of the crayon trick.</p>

<p>"Ilse, you&mdash;you didn't really do that?" she faltered. She
<i>knew</i> Ilse hadn't&mdash;she was <i>sure</i> of it&mdash;but
she wanted to hear her say so. To her surprise, a sudden blush
swept over Ilse's face.</p>

<p>"Is thy servant a dog?" she said, rather confusedly. It was very
unlike straightforward, outspoken Ilse to be so confused. She
turned her face away and began fumbling aimlessly with her
book-bag. "You don't suppose I'd do anything like that to you,
Emily?"</p>

<p>"No, of course not," said Emily, slowly. The subject was
dropped. But the little doubt and distrust at the bottom of Emily's
mind came out of its lurking-place and declared itself. Even yet
she couldn't believe Ilse could do such a thing&mdash;and lie about
it afterward. But why was she so confused and shamefaced? Would not
an innocent Ilse have stormed about according to form, berated
Emily, roundly, for mere suspicion, and aired the subject generally
until all the venom had been blown out of it?</p>

<p>It was not referred to again. But the shadow was there and
spoiled, to a certain extent, the Christmas holidays at New Moon.
Outwardly, the girls were the friends they had always been, but
Emily was acutely conscious of a sudden rift between them. Strive
as she would she could not bridge it. The seeming unconsciousness
of any such severance on Ilse's part served to deepen it. Hadn't
Ilse cared enough for her and her friendship to <i>feel</i> the
chill that had come over it? Could she be so shallow and
indifferent as not to perceive it? Emily brooded and grew morbid
over it. A thing like that&mdash;a dim, poisonous thing that lurked
in shadow and dared not come into the open&mdash;always played
havoc with her sensitive and passionate temperament. No open
quarrel with Ilse could have affected her like this&mdash;she had
quarrelled with Ilse scores of times and made up the next minute
with no bitterness or backward glance. <i>This</i> was different.
The more Emily brooded over it the more monstrous it grew. She was
unhappy, absent, restless. Aunt Laura and Cousin Jimmy noticed it
but attributed it to her disappointment over the star pin. She had
told them she was sure she would not win. But Emily had ceased to
care about the star pin.</p>

<p>To be sure, she had a bad time of it, when she went back to High
School and the examination results were announced. She was not one
of the envied four who flaunted star pins and Aunt Ruth rubbed it
in for weeks. Aunt Ruth felt that she had lost family prestige in
Emily's failure and she was very bitter about it. Altogether Emily
felt that the New Year had come in very inauspiciously for her. The
first month of it was a time she never liked to recall. She was
very lonely. Ilse could not come to see her, and though she made
herself go to see Ilse the subtle little rift between them was
slowly widening. Ilse still gave no sign of feeling it; but then,
somehow, she was seldom alone with Ilse now. The room was always
filled with girls, and there was a good deal of noise and laughter
and jokes and school gossip&mdash;all very harmless and even jolly,
but very different from the old intimacy and understanding
comradeship with Ilse. Formerly it used to be a chummy jest between
them that they could walk or sit for hours together and say no word
and yet feel that they had had a splendid time. There were no such
silences now: when they did happen to be alone together they both
chattered gaily and shallowly, as if each were secretly afraid that
there might come a moment for the silence that betrays.</p>

<p>Emily's heart ached over their lost friendship: every night her
pillow was wet with tears. Yet there was nothing she could do: she
could not, try as she would, banish the doubt that possessed her.
She made many an honest effort to do so. She told herself every day
that Ilse Burnley could never have played that trick&mdash;that she
was constitutionally incapable of it&mdash;and went straightway to
Ilse with the firm determination to be just what she had always
been to her. With the result that she was unnaturally cordial and
friendly&mdash;even gushing&mdash;and no more like her real self
than she was like Evelyn Blake. Ilse was just as cordial and
friendly&mdash;and the rift was wider still.</p>

<p>"Ilse never goes into a tantrum with me now," Emily reflected
sadly.</p>

<p>It was quite true. Ilse was always good-tempered with Emily,
presenting a baffling front of politeness unbroken by a single
flash of her old wild spirit. Emily felt that nothing could have
been more welcome than one of Ilse's stormy rages. It might break
the ice that was forming so relentlessly between them, and release
the pent-up flood of old affection.</p>

<p>One of the keenest stings in the situation was that Evelyn Blake
was quite well aware of the state of affairs between Ilse and
Emily. The mockery of her long brown eyes and the hidden sneer in
her casual sentences betrayed her knowledge and her enjoyment of
it. This was gall and wormwood to Emily, who felt that she had no
defence against it. Evelyn was a girl whom intimacies between other
girls annoyed, and the friendship between Ilse and Emily had
annoyed her especially. It had been so complete&mdash;so absorbing.
There had been no place in it for anyone else. And Evelyn did not
like to feel that she was barred out&mdash;that there was some
garden enclosed, into which she might not enter. She was therefore
hugely delighted to think that this vexingly beautiful friendship
between two girls she secretly hated was at an end.</p>

<h2><a name="c09" id="c09"><i>A Supreme Moment</i></a>
</h2>

<p>Emily came downstairs laggingly, feeling that all the colour and
music had somehow gone out of life, and that it stretched before
her in unbroken greyness. Ten minutes later she was encompassed by
rainbows and the desert of her future had blossomed like the
rose.</p>

<p>The cause of this miracle of transformation was a thin letter
which Aunt Ruth handed to her with an Aunt Ruthian sniff. There was
a magazine, too, but Emily did not at first regard it. She saw the
address of a floral firm on the corner of the envelope, and sensed
at touch the promising thinness of it&mdash;so different from the
plump letters full of rejected verses.</p>

<p>Her heart beat violently as she tore it open and glanced over
the typewritten sheet.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>MISS EMILY B. STARR,</p>

<p>Shrewsbury, P.E. Island,</p>

<p>Can.</p>

<p>DEAR MISS STARR:</p>

<p>It gives us great pleasure to tell you that your poem, <i>Owl's
Laughter</i> has been found available for use in <i>Garden and
Woodland.</i> It appears in the current issue of our magazine, a
copy of which we are sending you. Your verses have the true ring
and we shall be glad to see more of your work.</p>

<p>It is not our custom to pay cash for our contributions but you
may select two dollars' worth of seeds or plants from our catalogue
to be sent to your address prepaid.</p>

<p>Thanking you,</p>

<p>We remain,</p>

<p>Yours truly,</p>

<p>THOS. E. CARLTON &amp; CO.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Emily dropped the letter and seized upon the magazine with
trembling fingers. She grew dizzy&mdash;the letters danced before
her eyes&mdash;she felt a curious sensation of choking&mdash;for
there on the front page, in a fine border of curlicues, was her
poem&mdash;<i>Owl's Laughter,</i> by Emily Byrd Starr.</p>

<p>It was the first sweet bubble on the cup of success and we must
not think her silly if it intoxicated her. She carried the letter
and magazine off to her room to gloat over it, blissfully
unconscious that Aunt Ruth was doing an extra deal of sniffing.
Aunt Ruth felt very suspicious of suddenly crimsoned cheek and
glowing eye and general air of rapture and detachment from
earth.</p>

<p>In her room Emily sat down and read her poem as if she had never
seen it before. There was, to be sure, a printer's error in it that
made the flesh creep on her bones&mdash;it was awful to have
<i>hunter's moon</i> come out as <i>hunter's moan</i>&mdash;but it
was her poem&mdash;<i>hers&mdash;</i>accepted by and printed in a
<i>real</i> magazine.</p>

<p>And <i>paid</i> for! To be sure a cheque would have been more
acceptable&mdash;two dollars all her own, earned by her own pen,
would have seemed like riches to Emily. But what fun she and Cousin
Jimmy would have selecting the seeds! She could see in imagination
that beautiful flower-bed next summer in the New Moon
garden&mdash;a glory of crimson and purple and blue and gold.</p>

<p>And what was it the letter said?</p>

<p><i>"Your verses have the true ring and we shall be glad to see
more of your work."</i>
</p>

<p>Oh, bliss&mdash;oh, rapture! The world was hers&mdash;the
<i>Alpine Path</i> was as good as climbed&mdash;what signified a
few more scrambles to the summit?</p>

<p>Emily could not remain in that dark little room with its
oppressive ceiling and unfriendly furniture. Lord Byron's funereal
expression was an insult to her happiness. She threw on her wraps
and hurried out to the Land of Uprightness.</p>

<p>As she went through the kitchen, Aunt Ruth, naturally more
suspicious than ever, inquired with markedly bland sarcasm,</p>

<p>"Is the house on fire? Or the harbour?"</p>

<p>"Neither. It's my soul that's on fire," said Emily with an
inscrutable smile. She shut the door behind her and at once forgot
Aunt Ruth and every other disagreeable thing and person. How
beautiful the world was&mdash;how beautiful life was&mdash;how
wonderful the Land of Uprightness was! The young firs along the
narrow path were lightly powdered with snow, as if, thought Emily,
a veil of aerial lace had been tricksily flung over austere young
Druid priestesses foresworn to all such frivolities of vain
adornment. Emily decided she would write that sentence down in her
Jimmy-book when she went back. On and on she flitted to the crest
of the hill. She felt as if she were flying&mdash;her feet
<i>couldn't</i> really be touching the earth. On the hill she
paused and stood, a rapt, ecstatic figure with clasped hands and
eyes of dream. It was just after sunset. Out, over the ice-bound
harbour, great clouds piled themselves up in dazzling, iridescent
masses. Beyond were gleaming white hills with early stars over
them. Between the dark trunks of the old fir trees to her right,
far away through the crystal evening air, rose a great, round, full
moon.</p>

<p>"'It has the true ring,'" murmured Emily, tasting the incredible
words anew. "They want to see more of my work! Oh, if only Father
could see my verses in print!"</p>

<p>Years before, in the old house at Maywood, her father, bending
over her as she slept had said, "She will love deeply&mdash;suffer
terribly&mdash;she will have glorious moments to compensate."</p>

<p>This was one of her glorious moments. She felt a wonderful
lightness of spirit&mdash;a soul-stirring joy in mere existence.
The creative faculty, dormant through the wretched month just
passed, suddenly burned in her soul again like a purifying flame.
It swept away all morbid, poisonous, rankling things. All at once
Emily <i>knew</i> that Ilse had never done <i>that.</i> She laughed
joyously&mdash;amusedly.</p>

<p>"What a little fool I've been! Oh, <i>such</i> a little fool! Of
course, Ilse never did it. There's nothing between us
now&mdash;it's gone&mdash;gone&mdash;gone. I'll go right to her and
tell her so."</p>

<p>Emily hurried back adown her little path. The Land of
Uprightness lay all about her, mysterious in the moonlight, wrapped
in the exquisite reticence of winter woods. She seemed one with its
beauty and charm and mystery. With a sudden sigh of the Wind Woman
through the shadowy aisles came "the flash" and Emily went dancing
to Ilse with the afterglow of it in her soul.</p>

<p>She found Ilse alone&mdash;threw her arms around
her&mdash;hugged her fiercely.</p>

<p>"Ilse, do forgive me," she cried. "I shouldn't have doubted
you&mdash;I <i>did</i> doubt you&mdash;but now I know&mdash;I
<i>know.</i> You <i>will</i> forgive me?"</p>

<p>"You young goat," said Ilse.</p>

<p>Emily loved to be called a young goat. This was the old
Ilse&mdash;<i>her</i> Ilse.</p>

<p>"Oh, Ilse, I've been so unhappy."</p>

<p>"Well, don't bawl over it," said Ilse. "I haven't been very
hilarious myself. Look here, Emily, I've got something to tell you.
Shut up and listen. That day I met Evelyn at the Shoppe and we went
back for some book she wanted and we found you sound
asleep&mdash;so sound asleep that you never stirred when I pinched
your cheek. Then, just for devilment I picked up a black crayon and
said, 'I'm going to draw a moustache on her'&mdash;shut up! Evelyn
pulled a long face and said, 'Oh, no! that would be <i>mean,</i>
don't you think?' I hadn't had the slightest intention of doing
it&mdash;I'd only spoken in fun&mdash;but that shrimp Evelyn's
ungodly affectation of righteousness made me so mad that I decided
I would do it&mdash;shut <i>up!</i>&mdash;I meant to wake you right
up and hold a glass before you, that was all. But before I could do
it Kate Errol came in and wanted us to go along with her and I
threw down the chalk and went out. That's all, Emily, honest to
Caesar. But it made me feel ashamed and silly later on&mdash;I'd
say a bit conscience-stricken if I had such a thing as a
conscience, because I felt that <i>I</i> must have put the idea
into the head of whoever did do it, and so was responsible in a
way. And then I saw you distrusted me&mdash;and that made me
mad&mdash;not tempery-mad, you see, but a nasty, cold,
<i>inside</i> sort of madness. I thought you had no business even
to suspect that I could have done such a thing as let you go to
class like that. And I thought, since you did, you could go on
doing it&mdash;<i>I</i> wouldn't say one word to put matters
straight. Golly, but I'm glad you're through with seein'
things."</p>

<p>"Do you think Evelyn Blake did it?"</p>

<p>"No. Oh, she's quite capable of it, of course, but I don't see
how it could have been she. She went to the Shoppe with Kate and me
and we left her there. She was in class fifteen minutes later, so I
don't think she'd have had time to go back and do it. I really
think it was that little devil of a May Hilson. She'd do anything
and she was in the hall when I was flourishing the crayon. She'd
'take the suggestion as a cat laps milk.' But it couldn't have been
Evelyn."</p>

<p>Emily retained her belief that it could have been and was. But
the only thing that mattered now was the fact that Aunt Ruth still
believed Ilse guilty and would continue so to believe.</p>

<p>"Well, that's a rotten shame," said Ilse. "We can't have any
real chum-talks here&mdash;Mary always has such a mob in and E. B.
pervades the place."</p>

<p>"I'll find out who did it yet," said Emily darkly, "and
<i>make</i> Aunt Ruth give in."</p>

<p>On the next afternoon Evelyn Blake found Ilse and Emily in a
beautiful row. At least Ilse was rowing while Emily sat with her
legs crossed and a bored, haughty expression in her insolently
half-shut eyes. It should have been a welcome sight to a girl who
disliked the intimacies of other girls. But Evelyn Blake was not
rejoiced. Ilse was quarrelling with Emily again&mdash;<i>ergo,</i>
Ilse and Emily were on good terms once more.</p>

<p>"I'm so glad to see you've forgiven Ilse for that mean trick,"
she said sweetly to Emily the next day. "Of course, it was just
pure thoughtlessness on her part&mdash;I've always insisted on
<i>that</i>&mdash;she never stopped to think what ridicule she was
letting you in for. Poor Ilse is like that. You know I tried to
stop her&mdash;I didn't tell you this before, of
course&mdash;<i>I</i> didn't want to make any more trouble than
there was&mdash;but I <i>told</i> her it was a horribly mean thing
to do to a friend. I thought I <i>had</i> put her off. It's sweet
of you to forgive her, Emily dear. You <i>are</i> better-hearted
than I am. I'm afraid I could <i>never</i> pardon anyone who had
made me such a laughing-stock."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you slay her in her tracks?" said Ilse when she
heard of it from Emily.</p>

<p>"I simply half-shut my eyes and looked at her like a Murray,"
said Emily, "and that was more bitter than death."</p>

<h2><a name="c10" id="c10"><i>The Madness of an Hour</i></a>
</h2>

<p>The High School concert in aid of the school library was an
annual event in Shrewsbury, coming off in early April, before it
was necessary to settle down to hard study for spring examinations.
This year it was at first intended to have the usual programme of
music and readings with a short dialogue. Emily was asked to take
part in the latter and agreed, after securing Aunt Ruth's very
grudging consent, which would probably never have been secured if
Miss Aylmer had not come in person to plead for it. Miss Aylmer was
a granddaughter of Senator Aylmer and Aunt Ruth yielded to family
what she would have yielded to nothing else. Then Miss Aylmer
suggested cutting out most of the music and all of the readings and
having a short play instead. This found favour in the eyes of the
students and the change was made forthwith. Emily was cast for a
part that suited her, so she became keenly interested in the matter
and enjoyed the practices, which were held in the school building
two evenings of the week under the chaperonage of Miss Aylmer.</p>

<p>The play created quite a stir in Shrewsbury. Nothing so
ambitious had been undertaken by the High School students before:
it became known that many of the Queen's Academy students were
coming up from Charlottetown on the evening train to see it. This
drove the performers half wild. The Queen's students were old hands
at putting on plays. Of course they came to criticize. It became a
fixed obsession with each member of the cast to make the play as
good as any of the Queen's Academy plays had been, and every nerve
was strained to that end. Kate Errol's sister, who was a graduate
of a school of oratory, coached them and when the evening of the
performance arrived there was burning excitement in the various
homes and boarding-houses of Shrewsbury.</p>

<p>Emily, in her small, candle-lighted room, looked at
Emily-in-the-Glass with considerable satisfaction&mdash;a
satisfaction that was quite justifiable. The scarlet flush of her
cheeks, the deepening darkness of her grey eyes, came out
brilliantly above the ashes-of-roses gown, and the little wreath of
silver leaves, twisted around her black hair, made her look like a
young dryad. She did not, however, <i>feel</i> like a dryad. Aunt
Ruth had made her take off her lace stockings and put on cashmere
ones&mdash;had tried, indeed, to make her put on woollen ones, but
had gone down in defeat on that point, retrieving her position,
however, by insisting on a flannel petticoat.</p>

<p>"Horrid bunchy thing," thought Emily resentfully&mdash;meaning
the petticoat, of course. But the skirts of the day were full and
Emily's slenderness could carry even a thick flannel petticoat.</p>

<p>She was just fastening her Egyptian chain around her neck when
Aunt Ruth stalked in.</p>

<p>One glance was sufficient to reveal that Aunt Ruth was very
angry.</p>

<p>"Em'ly, Mrs. Ball has just called. She told me something that
amazed me. Is this a <i>play</i> you're taking part in
to-night?"</p>

<p>"Of course it's a play, Aunt Ruth. Surely you knew that."</p>

<p>"When you asked my permission to take part in this concert you
told me it was a <i>dialogue,"</i> said Aunt Ruth icily.</p>

<p>"O-o-h&mdash;but Miss Aylmer decided to have a little play in
place of it. I <i>thought</i> you knew, Aunt Ruth&mdash;truly I
did. I thought I mentioned it to you."</p>

<p>"You didn't think anything of the kind, Em'ly&mdash;you
deliberately kept me in ignorance because you knew I wouldn't have
allowed you to take part in a <i>play."</i></p>

<p>"Indeed, no, Aunt Ruth," pleaded Emily, gravely. "I never
thought of hiding it. Of course, I didn't feel like talking much to
you about it because I knew you didn't approve of the concert at
all."</p>

<p>When Emily spoke gravely Aunt Ruth always thought she was
impudent.</p>

<p>"This crowns all, Em'ly. Sly as I've always known you to be I
wouldn't have believed you could be as sly as this."</p>

<p>"There was nothing of the kind about it, Aunt Ruth!" said Emily
impatiently. "It would have been silly of me to try to hide the
fact that we were getting up a play when all Shrewsbury is talking
of it. I don't see how you could <i>help</i> hearing of it."</p>

<p>"You knew I wasn't going anywhere because of my bronchitis. Oh,
I see through it all, Em'ly. You cannot deceive <i>me."</i></p>

<p>"I haven't tried to deceive you. I thought you knew&mdash;that
is all there is to it. I thought the reason you never spoke of it
was because you were opposed to the whole thing. That is the truth,
Aunt Ruth. What difference is there between a dialogue and a
play?"</p>

<p>"There is <i>every</i> difference," said Aunt Ruth. "Plays are
wicked."</p>

<p>"But this is such a <i>little</i> one," pleaded Emily
despairingly&mdash;and then laughed because it sounded so
ridiculously like the nursemaid's excuse in <i>Midshipman Easy.</i>
Her sense of humour was untimely; her laughter infuriated Aunt
Ruth.</p>

<p>"Little or big, you are not going to take part in it."</p>

<p>Emily stared again, paling a little.</p>

<p>"Aunt Ruth&mdash;I <i>must</i>&mdash;why, the play would be
ruined."</p>

<p>"Better a play ruined than a soul ruined," retorted Aunt
Ruth.</p>

<p>Emily dared not smile. The issue at stake was too serious.</p>

<p>"Don't be so&mdash;so&mdash;indignant, Aunt Ruth"&mdash;she had
nearly said unjust. "I am sorry you don't approve of plays&mdash;I
won't take part in any more&mdash;but you can see I <i>must</i> do
it to-night."</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear Em'ly, I don't think you are quite as indispensable
as all <i>that."</i></p>

<p>Certainly Aunt Ruth was very maddening. How disagreeable the
word "dear" could be! Still was Emily patient.</p>

<p>"I really am&mdash;to-night. You see, they couldn't get a
substitute at the last moment. Miss Aylmer would never forgive
me."</p>

<p>"Do you care more about Miss Aylmer's forgiveness than God's?"
demanded Aunt Ruth with the air of one stating a decisive
position.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;than <i>your</i> God's," muttered Emily, unable to
keep her patience under such insensate questions.</p>

<p>"Have you no respect for your forefathers?" was Aunt Ruth's next
relevant query. "Why, if they knew a descendant of theirs was
play-acting they would turn over in their graves!"</p>

<p>Emily favoured Aunt Ruth with a sample of the Murray look.</p>

<p>"It would be excellent exercise for them. I am going to take my
part in the play to-night, Aunt Ruth."</p>

<p>Emily spoke quietly, looking down from her young height with
resolute eyes. Aunt Ruth felt a nasty sense of helplessness: there
was no lock to Emily's door&mdash;and she couldn't detain her by
physical force.</p>

<p>"If you go, you needn't come back here to-night," she said, pale
with rage. "This house is locked at nine o'clock."</p>

<p>"If I don't come back here to-night, I won't come at all." Emily
was too angry over Aunt Ruth's unreasonable attitude to care for
consequences. "If you lock me out I'll go back to New Moon.
<i>They</i> know all about the play there&mdash;even Aunt Elizabeth
was willing for me to take part."</p>

<p>She caught up her coat and jammed the little red-feather hat,
which Uncle Oliver's wife had given her at Christmas, down on her
head. Aunt Addie's taste was not approved at New Moon but the hat
was very becoming and Emily loved it. Aunt Ruth suddenly realized
that Emily looked oddly mature and grown-up in it. But the
knowledge did not as yet dampen her anger. Em'ly was
gone&mdash;Em'ly had dared to defy her and disobey her&mdash;sly,
underhand Em'ly&mdash;Em'ly must be taught a lesson.</p>

<p>At nine o'clock a stubborn, outraged Aunt Ruth locked all the
doors and went to bed.</p>

<p>The play was a big success. Even the Queen's students admitted
that and applauded generously. Emily threw herself into her part
with a fire and energy generated by her encounter with Aunt Ruth,
which swept away all hampering consciousness of flannel petticoats
and agreeably astonished Miss Errol, whose one criticism of Emily's
acting had been that she was rather cold and reserved in a part
that called for more abandon. Emily was showered with compliments
at the close of the performance. Even Evelyn Blake said
graciously,</p>

<p>"Really, dear, you are quite wonderful&mdash;a star
actress&mdash;a poet&mdash;a budding novelist&mdash;what surprise
will you give us next?"</p>

<p>Thought Emily, "Condescending, insufferable creature!"</p>

<p>Said Emily, <i>"Thank</i> you!"</p>

<p>There was a happy, triumphant walk home with Teddy, a gay good
night at the gate, and then&mdash;the locked door.</p>

<p>Emily's anger, which had been sublimated during the evening into
energy and ambition, suddenly flared up again, sweeping everything
before it. It was unbearable to be treated thus. She had endured
enough at Aunt Ruth's hands&mdash;this was the proverbial last
straw. One could not put up with <i>everything,</i> even to get an
education. One owed <i>something</i> to one's dignity and
self-respect.</p>

<p>There were three things she could do. She could thump the
old-fashioned brass knocker on the door until Aunt Ruth came down
and let her in, as she had done once before&mdash;and then endure
weeks of slurs because of it. She could fly up-street and
down-street to Ilse's boarding-house&mdash;the girls wouldn't be in
bed yet&mdash;as she had likewise done once before, and as no doubt
Aunt Ruth would expect her to do now; and then Mary Carswell would
tell Evelyn Blake and Evelyn Blake would laugh maliciously and tell
it all through the school. Emily had no intention of doing either
of these things; she knew from the moment she found the door locked
just what she would do. She would walk to New Moon&mdash;and stay
there! Months of suppressed chafing under Aunt Ruth's perpetual
stings burst into a conflagration of revolt. Emily marched out of
the gate, slammed it shut behind her with no Murray dignity but
plenty of Starr passion, and started on her seven-mile walk through
the midnight. Had it been three times seven she would have started
just the same.</p>

<p>So angry was she, and so angry she continued to be, that the
walk did not seem long, nor, though she had no wrap save her cloth
coat, did she feel the cold of the sharp April night.</p>

<p>The winter's snow had gone but the bare road was hard-frozen and
rough&mdash;no dainty footing for the thin kid slippers of Cousin
Jimmy's Christmas box. Emily reflected with what she considered a
grim, sarcastic laugh that it was well, after all, that Aunt Ruth
had insisted on cashmere stockings and flannel petticoat.</p>

<p>There was a moon that night, but the sky was covered with
curdled grey clouds, and the harsh, bleak landscape lay dourly in
the pallid grey light. The wind came across it in sudden, moaning
gusts. Emily felt with considerable dramatic satisfaction that the
night harmonized with her stormy, tragic mood.</p>

<p>She would <i>never</i> go back to Aunt Ruth's that was certain.
No matter what Aunt Elizabeth might say&mdash;and she <i>would</i>
say aplenty, no doubt of that&mdash;no matter what anyone would
say. If Aunt Elizabeth would not let her go anywhere else to board
she would give up school altogether. She knew it would cause a
tremendous upheaval at New Moon. Never mind. In her very reckless
mood upheavals seemed welcome things. It was time somebody
upheaved. She would not humiliate herself another day&mdash;that
she would not! Aunt Ruth had gone too far at last. You could not
safely drive a Starr to desperation.</p>

<p>"I have done with Ruth Dutton for ever," vowed Emily, feeling a
tremendous satisfaction in leaving off the "Aunt."</p>

<p>As she drew near home the clouds cleared away suddenly, and when
she turned into the New Moon lane the austere beauty of the three
tall Lombardies against the moonlit sky made her catch her breath.
Oh, how wonderful! For a moment she almost forgot her wrongs and
Aunt Ruth. Then bitterness rushed over her soul again&mdash;not
even the magic of the Three Princesses could charm it away.</p>

<p>There was a light shining out of the New Moon kitchen window,
falling on the tall, white birches in Lofty John's bush with
spectral effect. Emily wondered who could be up at New Moon: she
had expected to find it in darkness and had meant to slip in by the
front door and up to her own dear room, leaving explanations to the
morning. Aunt Elizabeth always locked and barred the kitchen door
every night with great ceremony before retiring, but the front door
was never locked. Tramps and burglars would surely never be so
ill-mannered as to come to the front door of New Moon.</p>

<p>Emily crossed the garden and peeped through the kitchen window.
Cousin Jimmy was there alone, sitting by the table, with two
candles for company. On the table was a stoneware crock and just as
Emily looked in he absently put his hand into it and drew out a
chubby doughnut. Cousin Jimmy's eyes were fixed on a big beef ham
hanging from the ceiling and Cousin Jimmy's lips moved soundlessly.
There was no reasonable doubt that Cousin Jimmy was composing
poetry, though why he was doing it at that hour o' night was a
puzzle.</p>

<p>Emily slipped around the house, opened the kitchen door gently,
and walked in. Poor Cousin Jimmy in his amazement tried to swallow
half a doughnut whole and then couldn't speak for several seconds.
Was <i>this</i> Emily&mdash;or an apparition? Emily in a dark-blue
coat, an enchanting little red-feather hat&mdash;Emily with
windblown night-black hair and tragic eyes&mdash;Emily with
tattered kid slippers on her feet&mdash;Emily in this plight at New
Moon when she should have been sound asleep on her maiden couch in
Shrewsbury?</p>

<p>Cousin Jimmy seized the cold hands Emily held out to him.</p>

<p>"Emily, dear child, what has happened?"</p>

<p>"Well, just to jump into the middle of things&mdash;I've left
Aunt Ruth's and I'm not going back."</p>

<p>Cousin Jimmy didn't say anything for a few moments. But he did a
few things. First he tiptoed across the kitchen and carefully shut
the sitting-room door; then he gently filled the stove up with
wood, drew a chair up to it, pushed Emily into it and lifted her
cold, ragged feet to the hearth. Then he lighted two more candles
and put them on the chimney-piece. Finally he sat down in his chair
again and put his hands on his knees.</p>

<p>"Now, tell me all about it."</p>

<p>Emily, still in the throes of rebellion and indignation, told it
pretty fully.</p>

<p>As soon as Cousin Jimmy got an inkling of what had really
happened he began to shake his head slowly&mdash;continued to shake
it&mdash;shook it so long and gravely that Emily began to feel an
uncomfortable conviction that instead of being a wronged, dramatic
figure she was by way of being a bit of a little fool. The longer
Cousin Jimmy shook his head the smaller grew her heroics. When she
had finished her story with a defiant, conclusive "I'm <i>not</i>
going back to Aunt Ruth's, anyhow," Cousin Jimmy gave a final wag
to his head and pushed the crock across the table.</p>

<p>"Have a doughnut, pussy."</p>

<p>Emily hesitated. She was very fond of doughnuts&mdash;and it had
been a long time since she had her supper. But doughnuts seemed out
of keeping with rebellion and tumult. They were decidedly
reactionary in their tendencies. Some vague glimmering of this made
Emily refuse the doughnut.</p>

<p>Cousin Jimmy took one himself.</p>

<p>"So you're not going back to Shrewsbury?"</p>

<p>"Not to Aunt Ruth's," said Emily.</p>

<p>"It's the same thing," said Cousin Jimmy.</p>

<p>Emily knew it was. She knew it was of no use to hope that Aunt
Elizabeth would let her board elsewhere.</p>

<p>"And you walked all the way home over those roads." Cousin Jimmy
shook his head. "Well, you <i>have</i> spunk. Heaps of it," he
added meditatively between bites.</p>

<p>"Do you blame me?" demanded Emily passionately&mdash;all the
more passionately because she felt some inward support had been
shaken away by Cousin Jimmy's head.</p>

<p>"No-o-o, it was a durn mean shame to lock you out&mdash;just
like Ruth Dutton."</p>

<p>"And you see&mdash;don't you&mdash;that I can't go back after
such an insult?"</p>

<p>Cousin Jimmy nibbled at the doughnut cautiously, as if bent on
trying to see how near he could nibble to the hole without actually
breaking through.</p>

<p>"I don't think any of your grandmothers would have given up a
chance for an education so easily," he said. "Not on the Murray
side, anyhow," he added after a moment's reflection, which
apparently reminded him that he knew too little about the Starrs to
dogmatize concerning them.</p>

<p>Emily sat very still. As Teddy would have said in cricket
parlance, Cousin Jimmy had got her middle wicket with the first
ball. She felt at once that when Cousin Jimmy, in that diabolical
fit of inspiration, dragged her grandmothers in, everything was
over but the precise terms of surrender. She could see them all
around her&mdash;the dear, dead ladies of New Moon&mdash;Mary
Shipley and Elizabeth Burnley, and all the rest&mdash;mild,
determined, restrained, looking down with something of contemptuous
pity on her, their foolish, impulsive descendant. Cousin Jimmy
appeared to think there might be some weakness on the Starr side.
Well, there wasn't&mdash;she would show him!</p>

<p>She <i>had</i> expected more sympathy from Cousin Jimmy. She had
known Aunt Elizabeth would condemn her and even Aunt Laura would
look disappointed question. But she had counted on Cousin Jimmy
taking her part. He always had before.</p>

<p>"My grandmothers never had to put up with Aunt Ruth," she flung
at him.</p>

<p>"They had to put up with your grandfathers." Cousin Jimmy
appeared to think that this was conclusive&mdash;as anyone who had
known Archibald and Hugh Murray might have very well thought.</p>

<p>"Cousin Jimmy, do you think I ought to go back and accept Aunt
Ruth's scolding and go on as if this had never happened?"</p>

<p>"What do <i>you</i> think about it?" asked Cousin Jimmy.
<i>"Do</i> take a doughnut, pussy."</p>

<p>This time Emily took the doughnut. She might as well have some
comfort. Now, you can't eat doughnuts and remain dramatic. Try
it.</p>

<p>Emily slipped from her peak of tragedy to the valley of
petulance.</p>

<p>"Aunt Ruth has been <i>abominable</i> these past two
months&mdash;ever since her bronchitis has prevented her from going
out. You don't know <i>what</i> it's been like."</p>

<p>"Oh, I do&mdash;I do. Ruth Dutton never made anyone feel better
pleased with herself. Feet getting warm, Emily?"</p>

<p>"I <i>hate</i> her," cried Emily, still grasping after
self-justification. "It's horrible to live in the same house with
anyone you hate&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Poisonous," agreed Cousin Jimmy.</p>

<p>"And it <i>isn't</i> my fault. I <i>have</i> tried to like
her&mdash;tried to please her&mdash;she's always twitting
me&mdash;she attributes mean motives to everything I do or
say&mdash;or <i>don't</i> do or say. I've never heard the last of
sitting in the corner of the pew&mdash;and failing to get a star
pin. She's always <i>hinting</i> insults to my father and mother.
And she's always <i>forgiving</i> me for things I haven't
done&mdash;or that don't need forgiveness."</p>

<p>"Aggravating&mdash;very," conceded Cousin Jimmy.</p>

<p>"Aggravating&mdash;you're right. I know if I go back she'll say
'I'll forgive you this time, but don't let it happen again.' And
she will <i>sniff</i>&mdash;oh, Aunt Ruth's sniff is the hatefulest
sound in the world!"</p>

<p>"Ever hear a dull knife sawing through thick cardboard?"
murmured Cousin Jimmy.</p>

<p>Emily ignored him and swept on.</p>

<p>"I can't be <i>always</i> in the wrong&mdash;but Aunt Ruth
thinks I am&mdash;and says she has 'to make allowances' for me. She
doses me with cod-liver oil&mdash;she never lets me go out in the
evening if she can help it&mdash;'consumptives should never be out
after eight o clock.' If <i>she</i> is cold, <i>I</i> must put on
an extra petticoat. She is always asking disagreeable questions and
refusing to believe my answers. She believes and always will
believe that I kept this play a secret from her because of slyness.
I never thought of such a thing. Why, the Shrewsbury <i>Times</i>
referred to it last week. Aunt Ruth doesn't often miss anything in
the <i>Times.</i> She twitted me for days because she found a
composition of mine that I had signed 'Emilie.' 'Better try to
spell your name after some unheard-of-twist,' she sneered!"</p>

<p>"Well, wasn't it a bit silly, pussy?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I suppose my grandmothers wouldn't have done it! But Aunt
Ruth needn't have kept it up as she did. <i>That</i> is what is so
dreadful&mdash;if she'd speak her mind on a thing and have done
with it. Why, I got a little spot of iron-rust on my white
petticoat and Aunt Ruth harped on it for weeks. She was determined
to find out <i>when</i> it was rusted and <i>how</i>&mdash;and I
hadn't the least idea. Really, Cousin Jimmy, when this had gone on
for three weeks I thought I'd have to scream if she mentioned it
again."</p>

<p><i>"Any</i> proper person would feel the same," said Cousin
Jimmy to the beef ham.</p>

<p>"Oh, any <i>one</i> of these things is only a pin-prick, I
know&mdash;and you think I'm silly to mind it&mdash;but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no. A hundred pin-pricks would be harder to put up with
than a broken leg. <i>I'd</i> sooner be knocked on the head and be
done with it."</p>

<p>"Yes, that's it&mdash;nothing but pin-pricks all the time. She
won't let Ilse come to the house&mdash;or Teddy, or
Perry&mdash;nobody but that stupid Andrew. I'm so tired of him. She
wouldn't let me go to the Prep dance. They had a sleigh drive and
supper at the Brown Teapot Inn and a little dance&mdash;everybody
went but me&mdash;it was the event of the winter. If I go for a
walk in the Land of Uprightness at sunset she is sure there is
something sinister in it&mdash;<i>she</i> never wants to walk in
the Land of Uprightness, so why should <i>I</i>? She says I have
got too high an opinion of myself. I
<i>haven't</i>&mdash;<i>have</i> I, Cousin Jimmy?"</p>

<p>"No," said Cousin Jimmy thoughtfully. "High&mdash;but not
<i>too</i> high."</p>

<p>"She says I'm always displacing things&mdash;if I look out of a
window she'll trot across the room and mathematically match the
corners of the curtains again. And it's
'Why&mdash;why&mdash;why'&mdash;all the time, <i>all</i> the time,
Cousin Jimmy."</p>

<p>"I know you feel a lot better now that you've got all that out
of your system," said Cousin Jimmy. "'Nother doughnut?"</p>

<p>Emily, with a sigh of surrender, took her feet off the stove and
moved over to the table. The crock of doughnuts was between her and
Cousin Jimmy. She <i>was</i> very hungry.</p>

<p>"Ruth give you enough to eat?" queried Cousin Jimmy
anxiously.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. Aunt Ruth keeps up one New Moon tradish at least. She
has a good table. But there are no snacks."</p>

<p>"And you always liked a tasty bite at bed-time, didn't you? But
you took a box back last time you were home?"</p>

<p>"Aunt Ruth confiscated it. That is, she put it in the pantry and
served its contents up at meal times. These doughnuts <i>are</i>
good. And there is always something exciting and lawless about
eating at unearthly hours like this, isn't there? How did you
happen to be up, Cousin Jimmy?"</p>

<p>"A sick cow. Thought I'd better sit up and look after her."</p>

<p>"It was lucky for me you were. Oh, I'm in my proper senses
again, Cousin Jimmy. Of course, I know you think I've been a little
fool."</p>

<p>"Everybody's a fool in some particular," said Cousin Jimmy.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll go back and bite the sour apple without a
grimace."</p>

<p>"Lie down on the sofa and have a nap. I'll hitch up the grey
mare and drive you back as soon as it begins to be daylight."</p>

<p>"No, that won't do at all. Several reasons. In the first place,
the roads aren't fit for wheels or runners. In the second place we
couldn't drive away from here without Aunt Elizabeth hearing us,
and then she'd find out all about it and I don't want her to. We'll
keep my foolishness a dark and deadly secret between you and me,
Cousin Jimmy."</p>

<p>"Then how are you going to get back to Shrewsbury?"</p>

<p>"Walk."</p>

<p>"Walk? To Shrewsbury? At this hour of the night?"</p>

<p>"Haven't I just walked from Shrewsbury at this hour? I can do it
again and it won't be any harder than bumping over those awful
roads behind the grey mare. Of course, I'll put something on my
feet that will be a little more protection than kid slippers. I've
ruined your Christmas present in my brain-storm. There is a pair of
my old boots in the closet there. I'll put them on&mdash;and my old
ulster. I'll be back in Shrewsbury by daylight. I'll start as soon
as we finish the doughnuts. Let's lick the platter clean, Cousin
Jimmy."</p>

<p>Cousin Jimmy yielded. After all, Emily was young and wiry, the
night was fine, and the less Elizabeth knew about some things the
better for all concerned. With a sigh of relief that the affair had
turned out so well&mdash;he had really been afraid at first that
Emily's underlying "stubbornness" had been reached and then,
whew!&mdash;Cousin Jimmy settled down to doughnuts.</p>

<p>"How's the writing coming on?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I've written a good deal lately&mdash;though it's pretty cold
in my room mornings, but I love it so&mdash;it's my dearest dream
to do something worth while some day."</p>

<p>"So you will. <i>You</i> haven't been pushed down a well," said
Cousin Jimmy.</p>

<p>Emily patted his hand. None realized better than she what Cousin
Jimmy might have done if <i>he</i> had not been pushed down a
well.</p>

<p>When the doughnuts were finished Emily donned her old boots and
ulster. It was a very shabby garment but her young-moon beauty
shone over it like a star in the old, dim, candle-lighted room.</p>

<p>Cousin Jimmy looked up at her. He thought that she was a gifted,
beautiful, joyous creature and that some things were a shame.</p>

<p>"Tall and stately&mdash;tall and stately like all our women," he
murmured dreamily. "Except Aunt Ruth," he added.</p>

<p>Emily laughed&mdash;and "made a face."</p>

<p>"Aunt Ruth will make the most of her inches in our forthcoming
interview. This will last her the rest of the year. But don't
worry, Cousin darling, I won't do any more foolish things for quite
a long time now. This has cleared the air. Aunt Elizabeth will
think it was dreadful of you to eat a whole crockful of doughnuts
yourself, you greedy Cousin Jimmy."</p>

<p>"Do you want another blank-book?"</p>

<p>"Not yet. The last one you gave me is only half-full yet. A
blank-book lasts me quite a while when I can't write stories. Oh, I
wish I could, Cousin Jimmy."</p>

<p>"The time will come&mdash;the time will come," said Cousin Jimmy
encouragingly. "Wait a while&mdash;just wait a while. If we don't
chase things&mdash;sometimes the things following us can catch up.
'Through wisdom is an house builded, and by understanding is it
established. And by knowledge shall the chambers be filled with all
precious and pleasant riches'&mdash;all precious and pleasant
riches, Emily. Proverbs twenty-fourth, third and fifth."</p>

<p>He let Emily out and bolted the door. He put out all the candles
but one. He glared at it for a few moments, then, satisfied that
Elizabeth could not hear him, Cousin Jimmy said fervently,</p>

<p>"Ruth Dutton can go to&mdash;to&mdash;to&mdash;" Cousin Jimmy's
courage failed him, "&mdash;to heaven!"</p>

<p>Emily went back to Shrewsbury through the clear moonlight. She
had expected the walk to be dreary and weary, robbed of the impetus
anger and rebellion had given. But she found that it had become
transmuted into a thing of beauty&mdash;and Emily was one of "the
eternal slaves of beauty," of whom Carman sings, who are yet
"masters of the world." She was tired, but her tiredness showed
itself in a certain exaltation of feeling and imagination such as
she often experienced when over-fatigued. Thought was quick and
active. She had a series of brilliant imaginary conversations and
thought out so many epigrams that she was agreeably surprised at
herself. It was good to feel vivid and interesting and all-alive
once more. She was alone but not lonely.</p>

<p>As she walked along she dramatized the night. There was about it
a wild, lawless charm that appealed to a certain wild, lawless
strain hidden deep in Emily's nature&mdash;a strain that wished to
walk where it would with no guidance but its own&mdash;the strain
of the gypsy and the poet, the genius and the fool.</p>

<p>The big fir-trees, released from their burden of snow, were
tossing their arms freely and wildly and gladly across the moonlit
fields. Was ever anything so beautiful as the shadows of those
grey, clean-limbed maples on the road at her feet? The houses she
passed were full of intriguing mystery. She liked to think of the
people who lay there dreaming and saw in sleep what waking life
denied them&mdash;of little children's dear hands folded in
exquisite slumber&mdash;of hearts that, perhaps, kept sorrowful,
wakeful vigils&mdash;of lonely arms that reached out in the
emptiness of the night&mdash;all while she, Emily, flitted by like
a shadowy wraith of the small hours.</p>

<p>And it was easy to think, too, that other things were
abroad&mdash;things that were not mortal or human. She always lived
on the edge of fairyland and now she stepped right over it. The
Wind Woman was really whistling eerily in the reeds of the
swamp&mdash;she was sure she heard the dear, diabolical chuckles of
owls in the spruce copses&mdash;something frisked across her
path&mdash;it might be a rabbit or it might be a Little Grey
Person; the trees put on half-pleasing, half-terrifying shapes they
never wore by day. The dead thistles of last year were goblin
groups along the fences: that shaggy, old yellow birch was some
satyr of the woodland: the footsteps of the old gods echoed around
her: those gnarled stumps on the hill field were surely Pan piping
through moonlight and shadow with his troop of laughing fauns. It
was delightful to believe they were.</p>

<p>"One loses so much when one becomes incredulous," said
Emily&mdash;and then thought that was a rather clever remark and
wished she had a Jimmy-book to write it down.</p>

<p>So, having washed her soul free from bitterness in the aerial
bath of the spring night and tingling from head to foot with the
wild, strange, sweet life of the spirit, she came to Aunt Ruth's
when the faint, purplish hills east of the harbour were growing
clear under a whitening sky. She had expected to find the door
still locked; but the knob turned as she tried it and she went
in.</p>

<p>Aunt Ruth was up and was lighting the kitchen fire.</p>

<p>On the way from New Moon Emily had thought over a dozen
different ways of saying what she meant to say&mdash;and now she
used not one of them. At the last moment an impish inspiration came
to her. Before Aunt Ruth could&mdash;or would&mdash;speak Emily
said,</p>

<p>"Aunt Ruth, I've come back to tell you that I forgive you, but
that this must not happen again."</p>

<p>To tell the truth, Mistress Ruth Dutton was considerably
relieved that Emily <i>had</i> come back. She had been afraid of
Elizabeth and Laura&mdash;Murray family rows were bitter
things&mdash;and truly a little afraid of the results to Emily
herself if she had really gone to New Moon in those thin shoes and
that insufficient coat. For Ruth Dutton was not a fiend&mdash;only
a rather stupid, stubborn little barnyard fowl trying to train up a
skylark. She was honestly afraid that Emily might catch a cold and
go into consumption. And if Emily took it into her head <i>not</i>
to come back to Shrewsbury&mdash;well, that would "make talk" and
Ruth Dutton hated "talk" when she or her doings was the subject.
So, all things considered, she decided to ignore the impertinence
of Emily's greeting.</p>

<p>"Did you spend the night on the streets?" she asked grimly.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear no&mdash;I went out to New Moon&mdash;had a chat with
Cousin Jimmy and some lunch&mdash;then walked back."</p>

<p>"Did Elizabeth see you? Or Laura?"</p>

<p>"No. They were asleep."</p>

<p>Mrs. Dutton reflected that this was just as well.</p>

<p>"Well," she said coldly, "you have been guilty of great
ingratitude, Em'ly, but I'll forgive you this time"&mdash;then
stopped abruptly. Hadn't that been said already this morning?
Before she could think of a substitute remark Emily had vanished
upstairs. Mistress Ruth Dutton was left with the unpleasant
sensation that, somehow or other, she had not come out of the
affair quite as triumphantly as she should have.</p>

<h2><a name="c11" id="c11"><i>Heights and Hollows</i></a>
</h2>

<p>"April 28, 19&mdash;</p>

<p>"This was my week-end at New Moon and I came back this morning.
Consequently this is blue Monday and I'm homesick. Aunt Ruth, too,
is always a little more <i>unliveable</i> on Mondays&mdash;or seems
so by contrast with Aunt Laura and Aunt Elizabeth. Cousin Jimmy
wasn't quite so nice this week-end as he usually is. He had several
of his queer spells and was a bit grumpy for two reasons: in the
first place, several of his young apple-trees are dying because
they were girdled by mice in the winter; and in the second place he
can't induce Aunt Elizabeth to try the new creamers that every one
else is using. For my own part I am secretly glad that she won't. I
don't want our beautiful old dairy and the glossy brown milk pans
to be improved out of existence. I can't think of New Moon without
a dairy.</p>

<p>"When I could get Cousin Jimmy's mind off his grievances we
explored the Carlton catalogue and discussed the best selections to
make for my two dollars' worth of owl's laughter. We planned a
dozen different combinations and beds, and got several hundred
dollars' worth of fun out of it, but finally settled on a long,
narrow bed full of asters&mdash;lavender down the middle, white
around it and a border of pale pink, with clumps of deep purple for
sentinels at the four corners. I am sure it will be beautiful: and
I shall look at its September loveliness and think, <i>'This</i>
came out of my head!'</p>

<p>"I have taken another step in the Alpine Path. Last week the
<i>Ladies' Own Journal</i> accepted my poem, <i>The Wind Woman,</i>
and gave me two subscriptions to the <i>Journal</i> for it. No
cash&mdash;but that may come yet. I <i>must</i> make enough money
before very long to pay Aunt Ruth every cent my living with her has
cost her. Then she won't be able to twit me with the expense I am
to her. She hardly misses a day without some hint of it&mdash;'No,
Mrs. Beatty, I feel I can't give quite as much to missions this
year as usual&mdash;my expenses have been much heavier, you
know'&mdash;'Oh, no, Mr. Morrison, your new goods are beautiful but
I can't afford a silk dress <i>this</i> spring'&mdash;'This
davenport should really be upholstered again&mdash;it's getting
fearfully shabby&mdash;but it's out of the question now for a year
or two.' So it goes.</p>

<p>"But my soul doesn't belong to Aunt Ruth.</p>

<p><i>"Owl's Laughter</i> was copied in the Shrewsbury
<i>Times</i>&mdash;'hunter's moan' and all. Evelyn Blake, I
understand, says she doesn't believe I wrote it at all&mdash;she's
<i>sure</i> she read something exactly like it somewhere some years
ago.</p>

<p>"Dear Evelyn!</p>

<p>"Aunt Elizabeth said nothing at all about it, but Cousin Jimmy
told me she cut it out and put it in the Bible she keeps on the
stand by her bed. When I told her I was to get two dollars' worth
of seeds for it she said I'd likely find when I sent for them that
the firm had gone bankrupt!</p>

<p>"I have a notion to send that little story about the child that
Mr. Carpenter liked to <i>Golden Hours.</i> I wish I could get it
typewritten, but that is impossible, so I shall have to write it
very plainly. I wonder if I <i>dare.</i> They would surely pay for
a story.</p>

<p>"Dean will soon be home. How glad I will be to see him! I wonder
if he will think I have changed much. I have certainly grown
taller. Aunt Laura says I will soon have to have really long
dresses and put my hair up, but Aunt Elizabeth says fifteen is too
young for that. She says girls are not so womanly at fifteen
nowadays as they were in <i>her</i> time. Aunt Elizabeth is really
frightened, I know, that if she lets me grow up I'll be
eloping&mdash;'like Juliet.' But I'm in no hurry to grow up. It's
nicer to be just like this&mdash;betwixt-and-between. Then, if I
want to be childish I can be, none daring to make me ashamed; and
if I want to behave maturely I have the authority of my extra
inches.</p>

<p>"It's a gentle, rainy evening to-night. There are pussy willows
out in the swamp and some young birches in the Land of Uprightness
have cast a veil of transparent purple over their bare limbs. I
think I will write a poem on <i>A Vision of Spring.</i></p>

<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

<p>"May 5, 19&mdash;</p>

<p>"There has been quite an outbreak of spring poetry in High
School. Evelyn has one in the May <i>Quill</i> on <i>Flowers.</i>
Very wobbly rhymes.</p>

<p>"And Perry! He also felt the annual spring urge, as Mr.
Carpenter calls it, and wrote a dreadful thing called <i>The Old
Farmer Sows His Seed.</i> He sent it to <i>The Quill</i> and <i>The
Quill</i> actually printed it&mdash;in the 'jokes' column. Perry is
quite proud of it and doesn't realize that he has made an ass of
himself. Ilse turned pale with fury when she read it and hasn't
spoken to him since. She says he isn't fit to associate with. Ilse
is far too hard on Perry. And yet, when I read the thing,
especially the verse,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"I've ploughed and harrowed and sown&mdash;<br>
I've done my best,<br>
Now I'll leave the crop alone<br>
And let God do the rest.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wanted to murder him myself. Perry can't understand what is
wrong with it.</p>

<p>"'It rhymes, doesn't it?'</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, it rhymes!</p>

<p>"Ilse has also been raging at Perry lately because he has been
coming to school with all but one button off his coat. I couldn't
endure it myself, so when we came out of class I whispered to Perry
to meet me for five minutes by the Fern Pool at sunset. I slipped
out with needle, thread and buttons and sewed them on. He didn't
see why it wouldn't have done to wait till Friday night and have
Aunt Tom sew them on. I said,</p>

<p>"'Why didn't you sew them on yourself, Perry?'</p>

<p>"'I've no buttons and no money to buy any,' he said, 'but never
mind, some day I will have gold buttons if I want them.'</p>

<p>"Aunt Ruth saw me coming in with thread and scissors, etc., and
of course wanted to know where, what and why. I told her the whole
tale and she said,</p>

<p>"'You'd better let Perry Miller's friends sew his buttons on for
him.'</p>

<p>"I'm the best friend he's got," I said.</p>

<p>"'I don't know where you get your low tastes from,' said Aunt
Ruth.</p>

<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

<p>"May 7, 19&mdash;</p>

<p>"This afternoon after school Teddy rowed Ilse and me across the
harbour to pick May-flowers in the spruce barrens up the Green
River. We got basketfuls, and spent a perfect hour wandering about
the barrens with the friendly murmur of the little fir-trees all
around us. As somebody said of strawberries so say I of Mayflowers,
'God might have made a sweeter blossom, but never did.'</p>

<p>"When we left for home a thick white fog had come in over the
bar and filled the harbour. But Teddy rowed in the direction of the
train whistles, so we hadn't any trouble really and I thought the
experience quite wonderful. We seemed to be floating over a white
sea in an unbroken calm. There was no sound save the faint moan of
the bar, the deep-sea call beyond, and the low dip of the oars in
the glassy water. We were alone in a world of mist on a veiled,
shoreless sea. Now and then, for just a moment, a cool air current
lifted the mist curtain and dim coasts loomed phantom-like around
us. Then the blank whiteness shut down again. It was as though we
sought some strange, enchanted shore that ever receded farther and
farther. I was really sorry when we got to the wharf, but when I
reached home I found Aunt Ruth all worked up on account of the
fog.</p>

<p>"'I knew I shouldn't have allowed you to go,' she said.</p>

<p>"'There wasn't any danger really, Aunt Ruth,' I protested, 'and
look at my lovely May-flowers.'</p>

<p>"Aunt Ruth wouldn't look at the May-flowers.</p>

<p>"'No danger&mdash;in a white fog! Suppose you had got lost and a
wind had come up before you reached land?'</p>

<p>"'How could one get lost on little Shrewsbury harbour, Aunt
Ruth?' I said. 'The fog was wonderful&mdash;wonderful. It just
seemed as if we were voyaging over the planet's rim into the depth
of space.'</p>

<p>"I spoke enthusiastically and I suppose I looked a bit wild with
mist drops on my hair, for Aunt Ruth said coldly, pityingly,</p>

<p>"'It is unfortunate that you are <i>so excitable,</i>
Emily.'</p>

<p>"It is maddening to be frozen and pitied, so I answered
recklessly,</p>

<p>"'But think of the fun you miss when you're non-excitable, Aunt
Ruth. There is nothing more wonderful than dancing around a blazing
fire. What matter if it end in ashes?'</p>

<p>"'When you are as old as I am,' said Aunt Ruth, you will have
more sense than to go into ecstasies over white fogs.'</p>

<p>"It seems to me impossible that I shall either grow old or die.
I <i>know</i> I will, of course, but I don't <i>believe</i> it. I
didn't make any answer to Aunt Ruth, so she started on another
tack.</p>

<p>"'I was watching Ilse go past. Em'ly, does that girl wear
<i>any</i> petticoats?'</p>

<p>"'<i>Her clothing is silk and purple,'</i> I murmured, quoting
the Bible verse simply because there is something in it that charms
me. One couldn't imagine a finer or simpler description of a
gorgeously dressed woman. I don't think Aunt Ruth recognized the
quotation: she thought I was just trying to be smart.</p>

<p>"'If you mean that she wears a purple silk petticoat, Em'ly, say
so in plain English. Silk petticoats, indeed. If <i>I</i> had
anything to do with her I'd silk petticoat her.'</p>

<p>"'Some day <i>I</i> am going to wear silk petticoats,' I
said.</p>

<p>"'Oh, indeed, miss. And may I ask what <i>you</i> have got to
get silk petticoats with?'</p>

<p>"'I've got a <i>future</i>,' I said, as proudly as the Murrayest
of all Murrays could have said it.</p>

<p>"Aunt Ruth sniffed.</p>

<p>"I have filled my room with May-flowers and even Lord Byron
looks as if there might be a chance of recovery.</p>

<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

<p>"May 13, 19&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have made the plunge and sent my story <i>Something
Different</i> to <i>Golden Hours</i>. I actually trembled as I
dropped it into the box at the Shoppe. Oh, if it should be
accepted!</p>

<p>"Perry has set the school laughing again. He said in class that
France <i>exported fashions.</i> Ilse walked up to him when class
came out and said, 'You <i>spawn!'</i> She hasn't spoken to him
since.</p>

<p>"Evelyn continues to say sweet cutting things and laugh. I might
forgive her the cutting things but never the laugh.</p>

<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

<p>"May 15, 19&mdash;</p>

<p>"We had our Prep 'pow-wow' last night. It always comes off in
May. We had it in the Assembly room of the school and when we got
there we found we couldn't light the gas. We didn't know what was
the matter but suspected the Juniors. (To-day we discovered they
had cut off the gas in the basement and locked the basement doors.)
At first we didn't know what to do: then I remembered that Aunt
Elizabeth had brought Aunt Ruth a big box of candles last week for
my use. I tore home and got them&mdash;Aunt Ruth being
out&mdash;and we stuck them all around the room. So we had our
Pow-wow after all and it was a brilliant success. We had such fun
improvising candle holders that we got off to a good start, and
somehow the candle-light was so much more friendly and inspiring
than gas. We all seemed to be able to think of wittier things to
say. Everybody was supposed to make a speech on any subject he or
she wished. Perry made the speech of the evening. He had prepared a
speech on 'Canadian History'&mdash;very sensible and, I suspect,
dull; but at the last minute he changed his mind and spoke on
'candles'&mdash;just making it up as he went along, telling of all
the candles he saw in different lands when he was a little boy
sailing with his father. It was so witty and interesting that we
sat enthralled and I think the students will forget about French
fashions and the old farmer who left the hoeing and weeding to
God.</p>

<p>"Aunt Ruth hasn't found out about the candles yet, as the old
box isn't quite empty. When I go to New Moon to-morrow night I'll
coax Aunt Laura to give me another box&mdash;I know she
will&mdash;and I'll bring them to Aunt Ruth.</p>

<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

<p>"May 22, 19&mdash;</p>

<p>"To-day there was a hateful, long, fat envelope for me in the
mail. <i>Golden Hours</i> had sent my story back. The accompanying
rejection slip said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"We have read your story with interest, and regret to say that
we cannot accept it for publication at the present time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>"At first I tried to extract a little comfort from the fact that
they had read it with 'keen interest.' Then it came home to me that
the rejection slip was a printed one, so of course it is just what
they send with <i>all</i> rejected manuscripts.</p>

<p>"The worst of it was that Aunt Ruth had seen the packet before I
got home from school and had opened it. It was humiliating to have
<i>her</i> know of my failure.</p>

<p>"'I hope <i>this</i> will convince you that you'd better waste
no more stamps on such nonsense, Em'ly. The idea of your thinking
<i>you</i> could write a story fit to be published.'</p>

<p>"'I've had two poems published,' I cried.</p>

<p>"Aunt Ruth sniffed.</p>

<p>"'Oh, <i>poems.</i> Of course they have to have something to
fill up the corners.'</p>

<p>"Perhaps it's so. I felt very flat as I crawled off to my room
with my poor story. I was quite 'content to fill a little space'
then. You could have packed me in a thimble.</p>

<p>"My story is all dog-eared and smells of tobacco. I've a notion
to burn it.</p>

<p>"No, I <i>wont!!</i> I'll copy it out again and try somewhere
else. I <i>will</i> succeed!</p>

<p>"I think, from glancing over the recent pages of this journal,
that I am beginning to be able to do without italics. But sometimes
they are necessary.</p>

<p>"New Moon, Blair Water.</p>

<p>"May 24, 19&mdash;</p>

<p>"'For lo, the winter is past: the rain is over and gone: the
flowers appear on the earth: the time of the singing of birds has
come.'</p>

<p>"I'm sitting on the sill of my open window in my own dear room.
It's so lovely to get back to it every now and then. Out there,
over Lofty John's bush, is a soft yellow sky and one very white
little star is just visible where the pale yellow shades off into
paler green. Far off, down in the south 'in regions mild of calm
and serene air' are great cloud-palaces of rosy marble. Leaning
over the fence is a choke-cherry tree that is a mass of blossoms
like creamy caterpillars. Everything is so lovely&mdash;'the eye is
not satisfied with seeing nor the ear with hearing.'</p>

<p>"Sometimes I think it really isn't worth while to try to write
anything when everything is already so well expressed in the Bible.
That verse I've just quoted for instance&mdash;it makes me feel
like a pigmy in the presence of a giant. Only twelve simple
words&mdash;yet a dozen pages couldn't have better expressed the
feeling one has in spring.</p>

<p>"This afternoon Cousin Jimmy and I sowed our aster bed. The
seeds came promptly. Evidently the firm has not gone bankrupt yet.
But Aunt Elizabeth thinks they are old stock and won't grow.</p>

<p>"Dean is home; he was down to see me last night&mdash;dear old
Dean. He hasn't changed a bit. His green eyes are as green as ever
and his nice mouth as nice as ever and his interesting face as
interesting as ever. He took both my hands and looked earnestly at
me.</p>

<p>"'You have changed, Star,' he said. 'You look more like spring
than ever. But don't grow any taller,' he went on. 'I don't want to
have you looking down on me.'</p>

<p>"I don't want to, either. I'd hate to be taller than Dean. It
wouldn't seem right at all.</p>

<p>"Teddy is an inch taller than I am. Dean says he has improved
greatly in his drawing this past year. Mrs. Kent still hates me. I
met her to-night, when I was out for a walk with myself in the
spring twilight, and she would not even stop to speak to
me&mdash;just slipped by me like a shadow in the twilight. She
looked at me for a second as she passed me, and her eyes were pools
of hatred. I think she grows more unhappy every year.</p>

<p>"In my walk I went and said good evening to the Disappointed
House. I am always so sorry for it&mdash;it is a house that has
never lived&mdash;that has not fulfilled its destiny. Its blind
windows seem peering wistfully from its face as if seeking vainly
for what they cannot find. No homelight has ever gleamed through
them in summer dusk or winter darkness. And yet I feel, somehow,
that the little house has kept its dream and that sometime it will
come true.</p>

<p>"I wish I owned it.</p>

<p>"I dandered around all my old haunts to-night&mdash;Lofty John's
bush&mdash;Emily's Bower&mdash;the old orchard&mdash;the pond
graveyard&mdash;the To-day Road&mdash;I love that little road. It's
like a personal friend to me.</p>

<p>"I think 'dandering' is a lovely word of its kind&mdash;not in
itself exactly, like some words, but because it is so perfectly
expressive of its own meaning. Even if you'd never heard it before
you'd know exactly what it meant&mdash;<i>dandering</i> could mean

<p>"May 29, 19&mdash;</p>

<p>"To-night Aunt Ruth came home with a portentous face.</p>

<p>"'Em'ly, what does this story mean that is all over
Shrewsbury&mdash;that you were seen standing on Queen-street last
night <i>with a man's arms around you, kissing him?'</i></p>

<p>"I knew in a minute what had happened. I wanted to stamp&mdash;I
wanted to laugh&mdash;I wanted to tear my hair. The whole thing was
so absurd and ludicrous. But I had to keep a grave face and explain
to Aunt Ruth.</p>

<p>"This is the dark, unholy tale.</p>

<p>"Ilse and I were 'dandering' along Queen-street last night at
dusk. Just by the old Taylor house we met a man. I do not know the
man&mdash;not likely I shall ever know him. I do not know if he was
tall or short, old or young, handsome or ugly, black or white, Jew
or Gentile, bond or free. But I <i>do</i> know he hadn't shaved
that day!</p>

<p>"He was walking at a brisk pace. Then something happened which
passed in the wink of an eye, but takes several seconds to
describe. I stepped aside to let him pass&mdash;he stepped in the
same direction&mdash;I darted the other way&mdash;so did
he&mdash;then I thought I saw a chance of getting past and I made a
wild dash&mdash;he made a dash&mdash;with the result that I ran
full tilt against him. He had thrown out his arms when he realized
a collision was unavoidable&mdash;I went right between
them&mdash;and in the shock of the encounter they involuntarily
closed around me for a moment while my nose came into violent
contact with his chin.</p>

<p>"'I&mdash;I&mdash;beg your pardon,' the poor creature gasped,
dropped me as if I were a hot coal, and tore off around the
corner.</p>

<p>"Ilse was in fits. She said she had never seen anything so funny
in her life. It had all passed so quickly that to a bystander it
looked exactly as if that man and I had stopped, gazed at each
other for a moment, and then rushed madly into each other's
arms.</p>

<p>"My nose ached for blocks. Ilse said she saw Miss Taylor peering
from the window just as it happened. Of course that old gossip has
spread the story with her own interpretation of it.</p>

<p>"I explained all this to Aunt Ruth, who remained incredulous and
seemed to consider it a very limping tale indeed.</p>

<p>"'It's a <i>very</i> strange thing that on a sidewalk twelve
feet wide you couldn't get past a man without embracing him,' she
said.</p>

<p>"'Come now, Aunt Ruth,' I said, 'I know you think me sly and
deep and foolish and ungrateful. But you know I am half Murray, and
<i>do</i> you think anyone with <i>any</i> Murray in her would
embrace a gentleman friend on the public street?'</p>

<p>"'Oh, I <i>did</i> think you could hardly be so brazen,'
admitted Aunt Ruth. 'But Miss Taylor said she <i>saw</i> it. Every
one has heard it. I do <i>not</i> like to have one of my family
talked about like that. It would not have occurred if you had not
been out with Ilse Burnley in defiance of my advice. Don't let
anything like this happen again.'</p>

<p>"'Things like that don't happen,' I said. 'They are
foreordained.'</p>

<p>"June 3, 19&mdash;</p>

<p>"The Land of Uprightness is a thing of beauty. I can go to the
Fern Pool to write again. Aunt Ruth is very suspicious of this
performance. She has never forgotten that I 'met Perry' there one
evening. The pool is very lovely now under its new young ferns. I
look into it and imagine it is the legendary pool in which one
could see the future. I picture myself tiptoeing to it at midnight
by full o' moon&mdash;casting something precious into it&mdash;then
looking timidly at what I saw.</p>

<p>"What would it show me? The Alpine Path gloriously climbed? Or
failure?</p>

<p>"No, never failure!</p>

<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

<p>"June 9, 19&mdash;</p>

<p>"Last week Aunt Ruth had a birthday and I gave her a
centre-piece which I had embroidered. She thanked me rather stiffly
and didn't seem to care anything about it.</p>

<p>"To-night I was sitting in the bay window recess of the
dining-room, doing my algebra by the last light. The folding-doors
were open and Aunt Ruth was talking to Mrs. Ince in the parlour. I
thought they knew I was in the bay, but I suppose the curtains hid
me. All at once I heard my name. Aunt Ruth was showing the
centre-piece to Mrs. Ince&mdash;quite proudly.</p>

<p>"'My niece Em'ly gave me this on my birthday. See how
beautifully it is done&mdash;she is very skilful with her
needle.'</p>

<p>"Could this be Aunt Ruth? I was so petrified with amazement that
I could neither move nor speak.</p>

<p>"'She is clever with more than her needle,' said Mrs. Ince. 'I
hear Principal Hardy expects her to head her class in the terminal
examinations.'</p>

<p>"'Her mother&mdash;my sister Juliet&mdash;was a <i>very</i>
clever girl,' said Aunt Ruth.</p>

<p>"'And she's quite pretty, too," said Mrs. Ince.</p>

<p>"'Her father, Douglas Starr, was a remarkably handsome man,'
said Aunt Ruth.</p>

<p>"They went out then. For once an eavesdropper heard something
good of herself!</p>

<p>"But from Aunt Ruth!!</p>

<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

<p>"June 17, 19&mdash;</p>

<p>"My 'candle goeth not out by night' now&mdash;at least not until
quite late. Aunt Ruth lets me sit up because the terminal
examinations are on. Perry infuriated Mr. Travers by writing at the
end of his algebra paper, Matthew 7:5. When Mr. Travers turned it
up he read: 'Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine
own eye, and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out
of thy brother's eye.' Mr. Travers is credited with knowing much
less about mathematics than he pretends to. So he was furious and
threw Perry's paper out 'as a punishment for impertinence.' The
truth is poor Perry made a mistake. He <i>meant</i> to write
Matthew 5:7. 'Blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain
mercy.' He went and explained to Mr. Travers but Mr. Travers
wouldn't listen. Then Ilse bearded the lion in his den&mdash;that
is, went to Principal Hardy, told him the tale and induced him to
intercede with Mr. Travers. As a result Perry got his marks, but
was warned not to juggle with Scripture texts again.</p>

<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

<p>"June 28, 19&mdash;</p>

<p>"School's out. I have won my star pin. It has been a great old
year of fun and study and <i>stings.</i> And now I'm going back to
dear New Moon for two splendid months of freedom and happiness.</p>

<p>"I'm going to write a Garden Book in vacation. The idea has been
sizzling in my brain for some time and since I can't write stories
I shall try my hand at a series of essays on Cousin Jimmy's garden,
with a poem for a tail-piece to each essay. It will be good
practice and will please Cousin Jimmy."</p>

<h2><a name="c12" id="c12"><i>At the Sign of the Haystack</i></a>
</h2>

<p><i>"Why</i> do you want to do a thing like that?" said Aunt
Ruth&mdash;sniffing, of course. A sniff may always be taken for
granted with each of Aunt Ruth's remarks, even when the present
biographer omits mention of it.</p>

<p>"To poke some dollars into my slim purse," said Emily.</p>

<p>Holidays were over&mdash;the Garden Book had been written and
read in instalments to Cousin Jimmy, in the dusks of July and
August, to his great delight; and now it was September, with its
return to school and studies, the Land of Uprightness, and Aunt
Ruth. Emily, with skirts a fraction longer and her hair clubbed up
so high in the "Cadogan Braid" of those days, that it really was
almost "up," was back in Shrewsbury for her Junior year; and she
had just told Aunt Ruth what she meant to do on her Shrewsbury
Saturdays, for the autumn.</p>

<p>The editor of the Shrewsbury <i>Times</i> was planning a special
illustrated Shrewsbury edition and Emily was going to canvass as
much of the country as she could cover for subscriptions to it. She
had wrung a rather reluctant consent from Aunt Elizabeth&mdash;a
consent which could never have been extorted if Aunt Elizabeth had
been paying all Emily's expenses at school. But there was Wallace
paying for her books and tuition fees, and occasionally hinting to
Elizabeth that he was a very fine, generous fellow to do so.
Elizabeth, in her secret heart, was not overfond of her brother
Wallace and resented his splendid airs over the little help he was
extending to Emily. So, when Emily pointed out that she could
easily earn, during the fall, at least half enough to pay for her
books for the whole year, Elizabeth yielded. Wallace would have
been offended, if <i>she,</i> Elizabeth, had insisted on paying
Emily's expenses when <i>he</i> took a notion to do it, but he
could not reasonably resent Emily earning part for herself. He was
always preaching that girls should be self-reliant, and able to
earn their own way in life.</p>

<p>Aunt Ruth could not refuse when Elizabeth had assented, but she
did not approve.</p>

<p>"The idea of your wandering over the country alone!"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll not be alone. Ilse is going with me," said Emily.</p>

<p>Aunt Ruth did not seem to consider this much of an
improvement.</p>

<p>"We're going to begin Thursday," said Emily. "There is no school
Friday, owing to the death of Principal Hardy's father, and our
classes are over at three on Thursday afternoon. We are going to
canvass the Western Road that evening."</p>

<p>"May I ask if you intend to camp on the side of the road?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no. We'll spend the night with Ilse's aunt at Wiltney.
Then, on Friday, we'll cut back to the Western Road, finish it that
day and spend Friday night with Mary Carswell's people at St.
Clair&mdash;then work home Saturday by the River Road."</p>

<p>"It's perfectly absurd," said Aunt Ruth. "No Murray ever did
such a thing. I'm surprised at Elizabeth. It simply isn't decent
for two young girls like you and Ilse to be wandering alone over
the country for three days."</p>

<p>"What do you suppose could happen to us?' asked Emily.</p>

<p>"A good many things might happen," said Aunt Ruth severely.</p>

<p>She was right. A good many things might&mdash;and
did&mdash;happen in that excursion; but Emily and Ilse set off in
high spirits Thursday afternoon, two graceless schoolgirls with an
eye for the funny side of everything and a determination to have a
good time. Emily especially was feeling uplifted. There had been
another thin letter in the mail that day, with the address of a
third-rate magazine in the corner, offering her three subscriptions
to the said magazine for her poem <i>Night in the Garden,</i> which
had formed the conclusion of her Garden Book and was considered
both by herself and Cousin Jimmy to be the gem of the volume. Emily
had left the Garden Book locked up in the mantel cupboard of her
room at New Moon, but she meant to send copies of its "tail pieces"
to various publications during the fall. It augured well that the
first one sent had been accepted so promptly.</p>

<p>"Well, we're off," she said, "'over the hills and far
away'&mdash;what an alluring old phrase! <i>Anything</i> may be
beyond those hills ahead of us."</p>

<p>"I hope we'll get lots of material for our essays," said Ilse
practically.</p>

<p>Principal Hardy had informed the Junior English class that he
would require several essays from them during the fall term and
Emily and Ilse had decided that one at least of their essays should
recount their experiences in canvassing for subscriptions, from
their separate points of view. Thus they had two strings to their
bow.</p>

<p>"I suggest we work along the Western Road and its branches as
far as Hunter's Creek, to-night," said Emily. "We ought to get
there by sunset. Then we can hit the gypsy trail across the
country, through the Malvern woods and come out on the other side
of them, quite near Wiltney. It's only half an hour's walk, while
around by the Malvern Road it's an hour. What a lovely afternoon
this is!"</p>

<p>It was a lovely afternoon&mdash;such an afternoon as only
September can produce when summer has stolen back for one more day
of dream and glamour. Harvest fields drenched in sunshine lay all
around them: the austere charm of northern firs made wonderful the
ways over which they walked: goldenrod beribboned the fences and
the sacrificial fires of willow-herb were kindled on all the burnt
lands along the sequestered roads back among the hills. But they
soon discovered that canvassing for subscriptions was not all
fun&mdash;though, to be sure, as Ilse said, they found plenty of
human nature for their essays.</p>

<p>There was the old man who said "Humph" at the end of every
remark Emily made. When finally asked for a subscription he gruffly
said "No."</p>

<p>"I'm glad you didn't say 'Humph' this time," said Emily. "It was
getting monotonous."</p>

<p>The old fellow stared&mdash;then chuckled.</p>

<p>"Are ye any relation to the proud Murrays? I worked at a place
they call New Moon when I was young and one of the Murray
gals&mdash;Elizabeth her name was&mdash;had a sort of
high-and-lofty way o' looking at ye, just like yours."</p>

<p>"My mother was a Murray."</p>

<p>"I was thinkin' so&mdash;ye bear the stamp of the breed. Well,
here's two dollars an' ye kin put my name down. I'd ruther see the
special edition 'fore I subscribe. I don't favour buying bearskins
afore I see the bear. But it's worth two dollars to see a proud
Murray coming down to askin' old Billy Scott fer a
subscription."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you slay him with a glance?" asked Ilse as they
walked away.</p>

<p>Emily was walking savagely, with her head held high and her eyes
snapping.</p>

<p>"I'm out to get subscriptions, not to make widows. I didn't
expect it would be all plain sailing."</p>

<p>There was another man who growled all the way through Emily's
explanations&mdash;and then, when she was primed for refusal, gave
her five subscriptions.</p>

<p>"He likes to disappoint people," she told Ilse, as they went
down the lane. "He would rather disappoint them agreeably than not
at all."</p>

<p>One man swore volubly&mdash;"not at anything in particular, but
just at large," as Ilse said; and another old man was on the point
of subscribing when his wife interfered.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't if I was you, Father. The editor of that paper is an
infidel."</p>

<p>"Very impident of him, to be sure," said "Father," and put his
money back in his wallet.</p>

<p>"Delicious!" murmured Emily when she was out of ear-shot. "I
must jot that down in my Jimmy-book." As a rule the women received
them more politely than the men, but the men gave them more
subscriptions. Indeed, the only woman who subscribed, was an
elderly dame whose heart Emily won by listening sympathetically to
a long account of the beauty and virtues of the said elderly lady's
deceased pet Thomas-cat&mdash;though it must be admitted that she
whispered aside to Ilse at its conclusion,</p>

<p>"Charlottetown papers please copy."</p>

<p>Their worst experience was with a man who treated them to a
tirade of abuse because his politics differed from the politics of
the <i>Times</i> and he seemed to hold them responsible for it.
When he halted for breath Emily stood up.</p>

<p>"Kick the dog&mdash;then you'll feel better," she said calmly,
as she stalked out. Ilse was white with rage. "Could you have
believed people could be so detestable?" she exploded. "To rate
<i>us</i> as if we were responsible for the politics of the
<i>Times!</i> Well&mdash;<i>Human Nature from a Canvasser's Point
of View</i> is to be the subject of my essay. I'll describe that
man and picture myself telling him all the things I wanted to and
didn't!"</p>

<p>Emily broke into laughter&mdash;and found her temper again.</p>

<p><i>"You</i> can. <i>I</i> can't even take that revenge&mdash;my
promise to Aunt Elizabeth binds me. I shall have to stick to facts.
Come, let's not think of the brute. After all, we've got quite a
lot of subscriptions already&mdash;and there's a clump of white
birches in which it is reasonably certain a dryad lives&mdash;and
that cloud over the firs looks like the faint, golden ghost of a
cloud."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, I should have liked to reduce that old vampire to
powder," said Ilse.</p>

<p>At the next place of call, however, their experience was
pleasant and they were asked to stay for supper. By sunset they had
done reasonably well in the matter of subscriptions and had
accumulated enough private jokes and by-words to furnish fun for
many moons of reminiscence. They decided to canvass no more that
night. They had not got quite as far as Hunter's Creek but Emily
thought it would be safe to make a cross-cut from where they were.
The Malvern woods were not so very extensive and no matter where
they came out on the northern side of them, they would be able to
see Wiltney.</p>

<p>They climbed a fence, went up across a hill pasture-field
feathered with asters, and were swallowed up by the Malvern woods,
crossed and recrossed by dozens of trails. The world disappeared
behind them and they were alone in a realm of wild beauty. Emily
thought the walk through the woods all too short, though tired
Ilse, whose foot had turned on a pebble earlier in the day, found
it unpleasantly long. Emily liked everything about it&mdash;she
liked to see that shining gold head of Ilse's slipping through the
grey-green trunks, under the long, swaying boughs&mdash;she liked
the faint dream-like notes of sleepy birds&mdash;she liked the
little wandering, whispering, tricksy wind o' dusk among the tree
crests&mdash;she liked the incredibly delicate fragrance of wood
flowers and growths&mdash;she liked the little ferns that brushed
Ilse's silken ankles&mdash;she liked that slender, white,
tantalizing thing which gleamed out for a moment adown the dim
vista of a winding path&mdash;was it a birch or a wood-nymph? No
matter&mdash;it had given her that stab of poignant rapture she
called "the flash"&mdash;her priceless thing whose flitting,
uncalculated moments were worth cycles of mere existence. Emily
wandered on, thinking all of the loveliness of the road and nothing
of the road itself, absently following limping Ilse, until at last
the trees suddenly fell away before them and they found themselves
in the open, with a wild sort of little pasture before them, and
beyond, in the clear afterlight, a long, sloping valley, rather
bare and desolate, where the farmsteads had no great appearance of
thrift or comfort.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;where are we?" said Ilse blankly. "I don't see
anything like Wiltney."</p>

<p>Emily came abruptly out of her dreams and tried to get her
bearings. The only landmark visible was a tall spire on a hill ten
miles away.</p>

<p>"Why, there's the spire of the Catholic church at Indian Head,"
she said flatly. "And that must be Hardscrabble Road down there. We
must have taken a wrong turning somewhere, Ilse&mdash;we've come
out on the east side of the woods instead of the north."</p>

<p>"Then we're five miles from Wiltney," said Ilse despairingly. "I
can never walk that far&mdash;and we can't go back through those
woods&mdash;it will be pitch dark in a quarter of an hour. What on
earth can we do?"</p>

<p>"Admit we're lost and make a beautiful thing of it," said Emily,
coolly.</p>

<p>"Oh, we're lost all right, to all intents and purposes," moaned
Ilse, climbing feebly up on the tumbledown fence and sitting there,
"but I don't see how we're going to make it beautiful. We can't
stay here all night. The only thing to do is to go down and see if
they'll put us up at any of those houses. I don't like the idea. If
that's Hardscrabble Road the people are all poor&mdash;and
<i>dirty.</i> I've heard Aunt Net tell weird tales of Hardscrabble
Road."</p>

<p>"Why can't we stay here all night?" said Emily. Ilse looked at
Emily to see if she meant it&mdash;saw that she did.</p>

<p>"Where can we sleep? Hang ourselves over this fence?"</p>

<p>"Over on that haystack," said Emily. "It's only half
finished&mdash;Hardscrabble fashion. The top is flat&mdash;there's
a ladder leaning against it&mdash;the hay is dry and
clean&mdash;the night is summer warm&mdash;there are no mosquitoes
this time of year&mdash;we can put our raincoats over us to keep
off the dew. Why not?"</p>

<p>Ilse looked at the haystack in the corner of the little
pasture&mdash;and began to laugh assentingly.</p>

<p>"What will Aunt Ruth say?"</p>

<p>"Aunt Ruth need never know it. I'll be sly for once with a
vengeance. Besides, I've always longed to sleep out in the open.
It's been one of the secret wishes I believed were for ever
unattainable, hedged about as I am with aunts. And now it has
tumbled into my lap like a gift thrown down by the gods. It's
really such good luck as to be uncanny."</p>

<p>"Suppose it rains," said Ilse, who, nevertheless, found the idea
very alluring</p>

<p>"It won't rain&mdash;there isn't a cloud in sight except those
great fluffy rose-and-white ones piling up over Indian Head.
They're the kind of clouds that always make me feel that I'd love
to soar up on wings as eagles and swoop right down into the middle
of them."</p>

<p>It was easy to ascend the little haystack. They sank down on its
top with sighs of content, realizing that they were tireder than
they had thought. The stack was built of the wild, fragrant grasses
of the little pasture, and yielded an indescribably alluring aroma,
such as no cultivated clover can give. They could see nothing but a
great sky of faint rose above them, pricked with early stars, and
the dim fringe of tree-tops around the field. Bats and swallows
swooped darkly above them against the paling western
gold&mdash;delicate fragrances exhaled from the mosses and ferns
just over the fence under the trees&mdash;a couple of aspen poplars
in the corner talked in silvery whispers, of the gossip of the
woods. They laughed together in sheer lawless pleasure. An ancient
enchantment was suddenly upon them, and the white magic of the sky
and the dark magic of the woods wove the final spell of a potent
incantation.</p>

<p>"Such loveliness as this doesn't seem real," murmured Emily.
"It's so wonderful it <i>hurts</i> me. I'm afraid to speak out loud
for fear it will vanish. Were we vexed with that horrid old man and
his beastly politics to-day, Ilse? Why, he doesn't exist&mdash;not
in <i>this</i> world, anyway. I hear the Wind Woman running with
soft, soft footsteps over the hill. I shall always think of the
wind as a personality. She is a shrew when she blows from the
north&mdash;a lonely seeker when she blows from the east&mdash;a
laughing girl when she comes from the west&mdash;and to-night from
the south a little grey fairy."</p>

<p>"How do you think of such things?" asked Ilse. This was a
question which, for some mysterious reason, always annoyed
Emily.</p>

<p>"I don't think of them&mdash;they <i>come,"</i> she answered
rather shortly.</p>

<p>Ilse resented the tone.</p>

<p>"For heaven's sake, Emily, don't be such a crank!" she
exclaimed.</p>

<p>For a second the wonderful world in which Emily was at the
moment living, trembled and wavered like a disturbed reflection in
water. Then&mdash;</p>

<p>"Don't let's quarrel <i>here,"</i> she implored. "One of us
might push the other off the haystack."</p>

<p>Ilse burst out laughing. Nobody can really laugh and keep angry.
So their night under the stars was not spoiled by a fight. They
talked for a while in whispers, of schoolgirl secrets and dreams
and fears. They even talked of getting married some time in the
future. Of course they shouldn't have, but they <i>did.</i> Ilse,
it appeared, was slightly pessimistic in regard to her matrimonial
chances.</p>

<p>"The boys like me as a pal but I don't believe any one will ever
really fall in love with me."</p>

<p>"Nonsense," said Emily reassuringly. "Nine out of ten men will
fall in love with you."</p>

<p>"But it will be the tenth I'll want," persisted Ilse
gloomily.</p>

<p>And then they talked of almost everything else in the world.
Finally, they made a solemn compact that whichever one of them died
first was to come back to the other if it were possible. How many
such compacts have been made! And has even one ever been kept?</p>

<p>Then Ilse grew drowsy and fell asleep. But Emily did not
sleep&mdash;did not want to sleep. It was too dear a night to go to
sleep, she felt. She wanted to lie awake for the pleasure of it and
think over a thousand things.</p>

<p>Emily always looked back to that night spent under the stars as
a sort of milestone. Everything in it and of it ministered to her.
It filled her with its beauty, which she must later give to the
world. She wished that she could coin some magic word that might
express it.</p>

<p>The round moon rose. Did an old witch in a high-crowned hat ride
past it on a broomstick? No, it was only a bat and the little tip
of a hemlock-tree by the fence. She made a poem on it at once, the
lines singing themselves through her consciousness without effort.
With one side of her nature she liked writing prose best&mdash;with
the other she liked writing poetry. This side was uppermost
to-night and her very thoughts ran into rhyme. A great, pulsating
star hung low in the sky over Indian Head. Emily gazed on it and
recalled Teddy's old fancy of his previous existence in a star. The
idea seized on her imagination and she spun a dream-life, lived in
some happy planet circling round that mighty, far-off sun. Then
came the northern lights&mdash;drifts of pale fire over the
sky&mdash;spears of light, as of empyrean armies&mdash;pale,
elusive hosts retreating and advancing. Emily lay and watched them
in rapture. Her soul was washed pure in that great bath of
splendour. She was a high priestess of loveliness assisting at the
divine rites of her worship&mdash;and she knew her goddess
smiled.</p>

<p>She was glad Ilse was asleep. Any human companionship, even the
dearest and most perfect, would have been alien to her then. She
was sufficient unto herself, needing not love nor comradeship nor
any human emotion to round out her felicity. Such moments come
rarely in any life, but when they do come they are inexpressibly
wonderful&mdash;as if the finite were for a second
infinity&mdash;as if humanity were for a space uplifted into
divinity&mdash;as if all ugliness had vanished, leaving only
flawless beauty. Oh&mdash;beauty&mdash;Emily shivered with the pure
ecstasy of it. She loved it&mdash;it filled her being to-night as
never before. She was afraid to move or breathe lest she break the
current of beauty that was flowing through her. Life seemed like a
wonderful instrument on which to play supernal harmonies.</p>

<p>"Oh, God, make me worthy of it&mdash;oh, make me worthy of it,"
she prayed. Could she ever be worthy of such a message&mdash;could
she dare try to carry some of the loveliness of that "dialogue
divine" back to the everyday world of sordid market-place and
clamorous street? She <i>must</i> give it&mdash;she could not keep
it to herself. Would the world listen&mdash;understand&mdash;feel?
Only if she were faithful to the trust and gave out that which was
committed to her, careless of blame or praise. High priestess of
beauty&mdash;yes, she would serve at no other shrine!</p>

<p>She fell asleep in this rapt mood&mdash;dreamed that she was
Sappho springing from the Leucadian rock&mdash;woke to find herself
at the bottom of the haystack with Ilse's startled face peering
down at her. Fortunately so much of the stack had slipped down with
her that she was able to say cautiously,</p>

<p>"I think I'm all in one piece still."</p>

<h2><a name="c13" id="c13"><i>Haven</i></a>
</h2>

<p>When you have fallen asleep listening to the hymns of the gods
it is something of an anti-climax to be awakened by an ignominious
tumble from a haystack. But at least it had aroused them in time to
see the sunrise over Indian Head, which was worth the sacrifice of
several hours of inglorious ease.</p>

<p>"Besides, I might never have known what an exquisite thing a
spider's web beaded with dew is," said Emily. <i>"Look</i> at
it&mdash;swung between those two tall, plumy grasses."</p>

<p>"Write a poem on it," jeered Ilse, whose alarm made her
fleetingly cross.</p>

<p>"How's your foot?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it's all right. But my hair is sopping wet with dew."</p>

<p>"So is mine. We'll carry our hats for a while and the sun will
soon dry us. It's just as well to get an early start. We can get
back to civilization by the time it's safe for us to be seen. Only
we'll have to breakfast on the crackers in my bag. It won't do for
us to be looking for breakfast, with no rational account to give of
where we spent the night. Ilse, swear you'll never mention this
escapade to a living soul. It's been beautiful&mdash;but it will
remain beautiful just as long as only we two know of it. Remember
the result of your telling about our moonlit bath."</p>

<p>"People have such beastly minds," grumbled Ilse, sliding down
the stack.</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>look</i> at Indian Head. I could be a sun worshipper
this very moment."</p>

<p>Indian Head was a flaming mount of splendour. The far-off hills
turned beautifully purple against the radiant sky. Even the bare,
ugly Hardscrabble Road was transfigured and luminous in hazes of
silver. The fields and woods were very lovely in the faint pearly
lustre.</p>

<p>"The world is always young again for just a few moments at the
dawn," murmured Emily.</p>

<p>Then she pulled her Jimmy-book out of her bag and wrote the
sentence down!</p>

<p>They had the usual experiences of canvassers the world over that
day. Some people refused to subscribe, ungraciously: some
subscribed graciously: some refused to subscribe so pleasantly that
they left an agreeable impression: some consented to subscribe so
unpleasantly that Emily wished they had refused. But on the whole
they enjoyed the forenoon, especially when an excellent early
dinner in a hospitable farmhouse on the Western Road filled up the
aching void left by a few crackers and a night on a haystack.</p>

<p>"S'pose you didn't come across any stray children to-day?" asked
their host.</p>

<p>"No. Have any been lost?"</p>

<p>"Little Allan Bradshaw&mdash;Will Bradshaw's son, down-river at
Malvern Point&mdash;has been missing ever since Tuesday morning. He
walked out of the house that morning, singing, and hasn't been seen
or heard of since."</p>

<p>Emily and Ilse exchanged shocked glances.</p>

<p>"How old was he?"</p>

<p>"Just seven&mdash;and an only child. They say his poor ma is
plumb distracted. All the Malvern Point men have been s'arching for
him for two days, and not a trace of him kin they discover."</p>

<p>"What can have happened to him!" said Emily, pale with
horror.</p>

<p>"It's a mystery. Some think he fell off the wharf at the
Point&mdash;it was only about a quarter of a mile from the house
and he used to like sitting there and watching the boats. But
nobody saw anything of him 'round the wharf or the bridge that
morning. There's a lot of marshland west of the Bradshaw farm, full
of bogs and pools. Some think he must have wandered there and got
lost and perished&mdash;ye remember Tuesday night was terrible
cold. <i>That's</i> where his mother thinks he is&mdash;and if you
ask <i>me,</i> she's right. If he'd been anywhere else he'd have
been found by the s'arching parties. They've combed the
country."</p>

<p>The story haunted Emily all the rest of the day and she walked
under its shadow. Anything like that always took almost a morbid
hold on her. She could not bear the thought of the poor mother at
Malvern Point. And the little lad&mdash;where was he? Where had he
been the previous night when she had lain in the ecstasy of wild,
free hours? That night had not been cold&mdash;but Wednesday night
had. And she shuddered as she recalled Tuesday night, when a bitter
autumnal windstorm had raged till dawn, with showers of hail and
stinging rain. Had he been out in that&mdash;the poor lost
baby?</p>

<p>"Oh, I can't <i>bear</i> it!" she moaned.</p>

<p>"It's dreadful," agreed Ilse, looking rather sick, "but
<i>we</i> can't do anything. There's no use in thinking of it.
Oh"&mdash;suddenly Ilse stamped her foot&mdash;"I believe Father
used to be right when he didn't believe in God. Such a hideous
thing as <i>this</i>&mdash;how could it happen if there <i>is</i> a
God&mdash;a <i>decent</i> God, anyway?"</p>

<p>"God hadn't anything to do with <i>this,"</i> said Emily. "You
<i>know</i> the Power that made last night couldn't have brought
about this monstrous thing."</p>

<p>"Well, He didn't prevent it," retorted Ilse&mdash;who was
suffering so keenly that she wanted to arraign the universe at the
bar of her pain.</p>

<p>"Little Allan Bradshaw may be found yet&mdash;he <i>must</i>
be," exclaimed Emily.</p>

<p>"He won't be found alive," stormed Ilse. "No, don't talk to me
about God. And don't talk to me of this. I've got to forget
it&mdash;I'll go crazy if I don't."</p>

<p>Ilse put the matter out of her mind with another stamp of her
foot and Emily tried to. She could not quite succeed but she forced
herself to concentrate superficially on the business of the day,
though she knew the horror lurked in the back of her consciousness.
Only once did she really forget it&mdash;when they came around a
point on the Malvern River Road and saw a little house built in the
cup of a tiny bay, with a steep grassy hill rising behind it.
Scattered over the hill were solitary, beautifully shaped young
fir-trees like little green, elongated pyramids. No other house was
in sight. All about it was a lovely autumnal solitude of grey,
swift-running, windy river, and red, spruce-fringed points.</p>

<p>"That house belongs to me," said Emily.</p>

<p>Ilse stared.</p>

<p>"To you?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Of course, I don't <i>own</i> it. But haven't you
sometimes seen houses that you knew belonged to you no matter who
owned them?"</p>

<p>No, Ilse hadn't. She hadn't the least idea what Emily meant.</p>

<p>"I know who owns that house," she said. "It's Mr. Scobie of
Kingsport. He built it for a summer cottage. I heard Aunt Net
talking of it the last time I was in Wiltney. It was finished a few
weeks ago. It's a pretty little house, but too small for me.
<i>I</i> like a big house&mdash;I don't want to feel cramped and
crowded&mdash;especially in summer."</p>

<p>"It's hard for a big house to have any personality," said Emily
thoughtfully. "But little houses almost always have. That house is
full of it. There isn't a line or a corner that isn't eloquent, and
those casement windows are lovable&mdash;especially that little one
high up under the eaves over the front door. It's absolutely
smiling at me. Look at it glowing like a jewel in the sunshine out
of the dark shingle setting. The little house is greeting us. You
dear friendly thing, I love you&mdash;I understand you. As Old
Kelly would say, 'may niver a tear be shed under your roof.' The
people who are going to live in you must be nice people or they
would never have <i>thought</i> you. If I lived in you, beloved,
I'd always stand at that western window at evening to wave to some
one coming home. That is just exactly what that window was built
for&mdash;a frame for love and welcome."</p>

<p>"When you get through with talking to your house we'd better
hurry on," warned Ilse. "There's a storm coming up. See those
clouds&mdash;and those sea-gulls. Gulls never come up this far
except before a storm. It's going to rain any minute. We'll not
sleep on a haystack to-night, Friend Emily."</p>

<p>Emily loitered past the little house and looked at it lovingly
as long as she could. It <i>was</i> such a dear little place with
its dubbed-off gables and rich, brown shingle tints, and its
general intimate air of sharing mutual jokes and secrets. She
turned around half a dozen times to look upon it, as they climbed
the steep hill, and when at last it dipped below sight she
sighed.</p>

<p>"I hate to leave it. I have the oddest feeling, Ilse, that it's
<i>calling</i> to me&mdash;that I ought to go back to it."</p>

<p>"Don't be silly," said Ilse impatiently. "There&mdash;it's
sprinkling now! If you hadn't poked so long looking at your blessed
little hut we'd have been out on the main road now, and near
shelter. Wow, but it's cold!"</p>

<p>"It's going to be a dreadful night," said Emily in a low voice.
"Oh, Ilse, where is that poor little lost boy to-night? I wish I
knew if they had found him."</p>

<p>"Don't!" said Ilse savagely, "Don't say another word about him.
It's awful&mdash;it's hideous&mdash;but what can <i>we</i> do?"</p>

<p>"Nothing. That's the dreadful thing about it. It seems wicked to
go on about our own business, asking for subscriptions, when that
child is not found."</p>

<p>By this time they had reached the main road. The rest of the
afternoon was not pleasant. Stinging showers came at intervals:
between them the world was raw and damp and cold, with a moaning
wind that came in ominous sighing gusts under a leaden sky. At
every house where they called they were reminded of the lost baby,
for there were only women to give or refuse subscriptions. The men
were all away searching for him.</p>

<p>"Though it isn't any use <i>now,"</i> said one woman gloomily,
"except that they may find his little body. He can't have lived
this long. I jest can't eat or cook for thinking of his poor
mother. They say she's nigh crazy&mdash;I don't wonder."</p>

<p>"They say old Margaret McIntyre is taking it quite calmly," said
an older woman, who was piecing a log-cabin quilt by the window.
"I'd have thought she'd be wild, too. She seemed real fond of
little Allan."</p>

<p>"Oh, Margaret McIntyre has never got worked up about anything
for the past five years&mdash;ever since her own son Neil was
frozen to death in the Klondyke. Seems as if her feelings were
frozen then, too&mdash;she's been a little mad ever since.
<i>She</i> won't worry none over this&mdash;she'll just smile and
tell you she spanked the King."</p>

<p>Both women laughed. Emily, with the story-teller's nose, scented
a story instantly, but though she would fain have lingered to hunt
it down Ilse hustled her away.</p>

<p>"We <i>must</i> get on, Emily, or we'll never reach St. Clair
before night."</p>

<p>They soon realized that they were not going to reach it. At
sunset St. Clair was still three miles away and there was every
indication of a wild evening.</p>

<p>"We can't get to St. Clair, that's certain," said Ilse. "It's
going to settle down for a steady rain and it'll be as black as a
million black cats in a quarter of an hour. We'd better go to that
house over there and ask if we can stay all night. It looks snug
and respectable&mdash;though it certainly is the jumping-off
place."</p>

<p>The house at which Ilse pointed&mdash;an old whitewashed house
with a grey roof&mdash;was set on the face of a hill amid bright
green fields of clover aftermath. A wet red road wound up the hill
to it. A thick grove of spruces shut it off from the gulf shore,
and beyond the grove a tiny dip in the land revealed a triangular
glimpse of misty, white-capped, grey sea. The near brook valley was
filled with young spruces, dark-green in the rain. The grey clouds
hung heavily over it. Suddenly the sun broke through the clouds in
the west for one magical moment. The hill of clover meadows flashed
instantly into incredibly vivid green. The tri-angle of sea
shimmered into violet. The old house gleamed like white marble
against the emerald of its hilly background, and the inky black sky
over and around it.</p>

<p>"Oh," gasped Emily, "I never saw anything so wonderful!"</p>

<p>She groped wildly in her bag and clutched her Jimmy-book. The
post of a field-gate served as a desk<i>&mdash;</i>Emily licked a
stubborn pencil and wrote feverishly. Ilse squatted on a stone in a
fence corner and waited with ostentatious patience. She knew that
when a certain look appeared on Emily's face she was not to be
dragged away until she was ready to go. The sun had vanished and
the rain was beginning to fall again when Emily put her Jimmy-book
back into her bag, with a sigh of satisfaction.</p>

<p>"I <i>had</i> to get it, Ilse."</p>

<p>"Couldn't you have waited till you got to dry land and wrote it
down from memory?" grumbled Ilse, uncoiling herself from her
stone.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;I'd have missed some of the flavour then. I've got it
all now&mdash;and in just exactly the right words. Come
on&mdash;I'll race you to the house. Oh, smell that
wind&mdash;there's nothing in all the world like a salt
sea-wind&mdash;a savage salt sea-wind. After all, there's something
delightful in a storm. There's always <i>something</i>&mdash;deep
down in me&mdash;that seems to rise and leap out to meet a
storm&mdash;wrestle with it."</p>

<p>"I feel that way sometimes&mdash;but not to-night," said Ilse.
"I'm tired&mdash;and that poor baby&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh!" Emily's triumph and exultation went from her in a cry of
pain. "Oh&mdash;Ilse&mdash;I'd forgotten for a moment&mdash;how
could I! <i>Where</i> can he be?"</p>

<p>"Dead," said Ilse harshly. "It's better to think so&mdash;than
to think of him alive still&mdash;out to-night. Come, we've got to
get in somewhere. The storm is on for good now&mdash;no more
showers."</p>

<p>An angular woman panoplied in a white apron so stiffly starched
that it could easily have stood alone, opened the door of the house
on the hill and bade them enter.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, you can stay here, I reckon," she said, not
inhospitably, "if you'll excuse things being a bit upset. They're
in sad trouble here."</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;I'm sorry," stammered Emily. "We won't
intrude&mdash;we'll go somewhere else."</p>

<p>"Oh, we don't mind <i>you,</i> if you don't mind <i>us.</i>
There's a spare room. You're welcome. You can't go on in a storm
like this&mdash;there isn't another house for some ways. I advise
you to stop here. I'll get you a bit of supper&mdash;I don't live
here&mdash;I'm just a neighbour come to help 'em out a bit.
Hollinger's my name&mdash;Mrs. Julia Hollinger. Mrs. Bradshaw ain't
good for anything&mdash;you've heard of her little boy mebbe."</p>

<p>"Is this where&mdash;and&mdash;he&mdash;hasn't&mdash;been
found?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;never will be. I'm not mentioning it to
her"&mdash;with a quick glance over her shoulder along the
hall&mdash;"but it's my opinion he got in the quicksands down by
the bay. That's what <i>I</i> think. Come in and lay off your
things. I s'pose you don't mind eating in the kitchen. The room is
cold&mdash;we haven't the stove up in it yet. It'll have to be put
up soon if there's a funeral. I s'pose there won't be if he's in
the quicksand. You can't have a funeral without a body, can
you?"</p>

<p>All this was very gruesome. Emily and Ilse would fain have gone
elsewhere&mdash;but the storm had broken in full fury and darkness
seemed to pour in from the sea over the changed world. They took
off their drenched hats and coats and followed their hostess to the
kitchen, a clean, old-fashioned spot which seemed cheerful enough
in lamp-light and fire-glow.</p>

<p>"Sit up to the fire. I'll poke it a bit. Don't mind Grandfather
Bradshaw&mdash;Grandfather, here's two young ladies that want to
stay all night."</p>

<p>Grandfather stared stonily at them out of little, hazy, blue
eyes and said not a word.</p>

<p>"Don't mind him"&mdash;in a pig's whisper&mdash;"he's over
ninety and he never was much of a talker. Clara&mdash;Mrs.
Bradshaw&mdash;is in there"&mdash;nodding towards the door of what
seemed a small bedroom off the kitchen. "Her brother's with
her&mdash;Dr. McIntyre from Charlottetown. We sent for him
yesterday. He's the only one that can do anything with her. She's
been walking the floor all day but we've got her persuaded to lie
down a bit. Her husband's out looking for little Allan."</p>

<p>"A child <i>can't</i> be lost in the nineteenth century," said
Grandfather Bradshaw, with uncanny suddenness and positiveness.</p>

<p>"There, there now, Grandfather, I advise <i>you</i> not to get
worked up. And this is the twentieth century now. He's still living
back there. His memory stopped a few years ago. What might your
names be? Burnley? Starr? From Blair Water? Oh, then you'll know
the Murrays? Niece? Oh!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Julia Hollinger's "Oh" was subtly eloquent. She had been
setting dishes and food down at a rapid rate on the clean oil-cloth
on the table. Now she swept them aside, extracted a table-cloth
from a drawer of the cupboard, got silver forks and spoons out of
another drawer, and a handsome pair of salt and pepper shakers from
the shelves.</p>

<p>"Don't go to any trouble for us," pleaded Emily.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's no trouble. If all was well here you'd find Mrs.
Bradshaw real glad to have you. She's a very kind woman, poor soul.
It's awful hard to see her in such trouble. Allan was all the child
she had, you see."</p>

<p>"A child can't be <i>lost</i> in the nineteenth century, I tell
you," repeated Grandfather Bradshaw, with an irritable shift of
emphasis.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;no," soothingly, "of course not, Grandfather. Little
Allan'll turn up all right yet. Here's a hot cup o' tea for you. I
advise you to drink it. <i>That'll</i> keep him quiet for a bit.
Not that he's ever very fussy&mdash;only everybody's a bit
upset&mdash;except old Mrs. McIntyre. Nothing ever upsets
<i>her.</i> It's just as well, only it seems to me real unfeeling.
'Course, she isn't just right. Come, sit in and have a bite, girls.
Listen to that rain, will you? The men will be soaked. They can't
search much longer to-night&mdash;Will will soon be home. I sorter
dread it&mdash;Clara'll go wild again when he comes home without
little Allan. We had a terrible time with her last night, pore
thing."</p>

<p>"A child can't be lost in the <i>nineteenth</i> century," said
Grandfather Bradshaw&mdash;and choked over his hot drink in his
indignation.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;nor in the twentieth neither," said Mrs. Hollinger,
patting him on the back. "I advise you to go to bed, Grandfather.
You're tired."</p>

<p>"I am <i>not</i> tired and I will go to bed when I choose, Julia
Hollinger."</p>

<p>"Oh, very well, Grandfather. I advise you not to get worked up.
I think I'll take a cup o' tea in to Clara. Perhaps she'll take it
now. She hasn't eaten or drunk since Tuesday night. How can a woman
stand that&mdash;I put it to you?"</p>

<p>Emily and Ilse ate their supper with what appetite they could
summon up, while Grandfather Bradshaw watched them suspiciously,
and sorrowful sounds reached them from the little inner room.</p>

<p>"It is wet and cold to-night&mdash;where is he&mdash;my little
son?" moaned a woman's voice, with an undertone of agony that made
Emily writhe as if she felt it herself.</p>

<p>"They'll find him soon, Clara," said Mrs. Hollinger, in a
sprightly tone of artificial comfort. "Just you be
patient&mdash;take a sleep, I advise you&mdash;they're bound to
find him soon."</p>

<p>"They'll never find him." The voice was almost a scream, now.
"He is dead&mdash;he is dead&mdash;he died that bitter cold Tuesday
night so long ago. O God, have mercy! He was such a little fellow!
And I've told him so often not to speak until he was spoken
to&mdash;he'll never speak to me again. I wouldn't let him have a
light after he went to bed&mdash;and he died in the dark, alone and
cold. I wouldn't let him have a dog&mdash;he wanted one so much.
But he wants nothing now&mdash;only a grave and a shroud."</p>

<p>"I can't endure this," muttered Emily. "I <i>can't,</i> Ilse. I
feel as if I'd go mad with horror. I'd rather be out in the
storm."</p>

<p>Lank Mrs. Hollinger, looking at once sympathetic and important,
came out of the bedroom and shut the door.</p>

<p>"Awful, isn't it! She'll go on like that all night. Would you
like to go to bed? Its quite airly, but mebbe you're tired an' 'ud
ruther be where you can't hear her, pore soul. She wouldn't take
the tea&mdash;she's scared the doctor put a sleeping pill in it.
She doesn't want to sleep till he's found, dead or alive. If he's
in the quicksands o' course he never <i>will</i> be found."</p>

<p>"Julia Hollinger, you are a fool and the daughter of a fool, but
surely even you must see that a child <i>can't</i> be lost in the
nineteenth century," said Grandfather Bradshaw.</p>

<p>"Well, if it was anybody but you called me a fool, Grandfather,
I'd be mad," said Mrs. Hollinger, a trifle tartly. She lighted a
lamp and took the girls upstairs. "I hope you'll sleep. I advise
you to get in between the blankets though there's sheets on the
bed. They wuz all aired to-day, blankets <i>and</i> sheets. I
thought it'd be better to air 'em in case there was a funeral. I
remember the New Moon Murrays wuz always particular about airing
their beds, so I thought I'd mention it. Listen to that wind. We'll
likely hear of awful damage from this storm. I wouldn't wonder if
the roof blew off this house to-night. Troubles never come singly.
I advise you not to git upset if you hear a noise through the
night. If the men bring the body home Clara'll likely act like all
possessed, pore thing. Mebbe you'd better turn the key in the lock.
Old Mrs. McIntyre wanders round a bit sometimes. She's quite
harmless and mostly sane enough but it gives folks a start."</p>

<p>The girls felt relieved as the door closed behind Mrs.
Hollinger. She was a good soul, doing her neighbourly duty as she
conceived it, faithfully, but she was not exactly cheerful company.
They found themselves in a tiny, meticulously neat "spare room"
under the sloping eaves. Most of the space in it was occupied by a
big comfortable bed that looked as if it were meant to be slept in,
and not merely to decorate the room. A little four-paned window,
with a spotless white muslin frill, shut them in from the cold,
stormy night that was on the sea.</p>

<p>"Ugh," shivered Ilse, and got into the bed as speedily as
possible. Emily followed her more slowly, forgetting about the key.
Ilse, tired out, fell asleep almost immediately, but Emily could
not sleep. She lay and suffered, straining her ears for the sound
of footsteps. The rain dashed against the window, not in drops, but
sheets, the wind snarled and shrieked. Down below the hill she
heard the white waves ravening along the dark shore. Could it be
only twenty-four hours since that moonlit, summery glamour of the
haystack and the ferny pasture? Why, that must have been in another
world.</p>

<p>Where was that poor lost child? In one of the pauses of the
storm she fancied she heard a little whimper overhead in the dark
as if some lonely little soul, lately freed from the body, were
trying to find its way to kin. She could discover no way of escape
from her pain: her gates of dream were shut against her: she could
not detach her mind from her feelings and dramatize them. Her
nerves grew strained and tense. Painfully she sent her thoughts out
into the storm, seeking, striving to pierce the mystery of the
child's whereabouts. He <i>must</i> be found&mdash;she clenched her
hands&mdash;he <i>must.</i> That poor mother!</p>

<p>"O God, let him be found, <i>safe</i>&mdash;let him be found,
<i>safe,"</i> Emily prayed desperately and insistently, over and
over again&mdash;all the more desperately and insistently because
it seemed a prayer so impossible of fulfilment. But she reiterated
it to bar out of her mind terrible pictures of swamp and quicksand
and river, until at last she was so weary that mental torture could
no longer keep her awake, and she fell into a troubled slumber,
while the storm roared on and the baffled searchers finally gave up
their vain quest.</p>

<h2><a name="c14" id="c14"><i>The Woman Who Spanked the
King</i></a>
</h2>

<p>The wet dawn came up from the gulf in the wake of the spent
storm and crept greyly into the little spare room of the
whitewashed house on the hill. Emily woke with a start from a
troubled dream of seeking&mdash;and finding&mdash;the lost boy. But
where she had found him she could not now remember. Ilse was still
asleep at the back of the bed, her pale-gold curls lying in a
silken heap on the pillow. Emily, her thoughts still tangled in the
cobweb meshes of her dream, looked around the room&mdash;and
thought she must be dreaming still.</p>

<p>By the tiny table, covered with its white, lace-trimmed cloth, a
woman was sitting&mdash;a tall, stout, old woman, wearing over her
thick grey hair a spotless white widow's cap, such as the old
Highland Scotch-women still wore in the early years of the century.
She had on a dress of plum-coloured drugget with a large, snowy
apron, and she wore it with the air of a queen. A neat blue shawl
was folded over her breast. Her face was curiously white and deeply
wrinkled but Emily, with her gift for seeing essentials, saw
instantly the strength and vivacity which still characterized every
feature. She saw, too, that the beautiful, clear blue eyes looked
as if their owner had been dreadfully hurt sometime. This must be
the old Mrs. McIntyre of whom Mrs. Hollinger had spoken. And if so,
then old Mrs. McIntyre was a very dignified personage indeed.</p>

<p>Mrs. McIntyre sat with her hands folded on her lap, looking
steadily at Emily with a gaze in which there was something hard to
define&mdash;something just a little strange. Emily recalled the
fact that Mrs. McIntyre was supposed to be not "quite right." She
wondered a little uneasily what she should do. Ought she to speak?
Mrs. McIntyre saved her the trouble of deciding.</p>

<p>"You will be having Highlandmen for your forefathers?" she said,
in an unexpectedly rich, powerful voice, full of the delightful
Highland accent.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Emily.</p>

<p>"And you will be Presbyterian?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"They will be the only decent things to be," remarked Mrs.
McIntyre in a tone of satisfaction. "And will you please be telling
me what your name is? Emily Starr! That will be a fery pretty name.
I will be telling you mine&mdash;it iss Mistress Margaret McIntyre.
I am no common person&mdash;I am the woman who spanked the
King."</p>

<p>Again Emily, now thoroughly awake, thrilled with the
story-teller's instinct. But Ilse, awakening at the moment, gave a
low exclamation of surprise. Mistress McIntyre lifted her head with
a quite regal gesture.</p>

<p>"You will not be afraid of me, my dear. I will not be hurting
you although I will be the woman who spanked the King. That iss
what the people say of me&mdash;oh, yess&mdash;as I walk into the
church. 'She iss the woman who spanked the King.'"</p>

<p>"I suppose," said Emily hesitatingly, "that we'd better be
getting up."</p>

<p>"You will not be rising until I haf told you my tale," said
Mistress McIntyre firmly. "I will be knowing as soon as I saw you
that you will be the one to hear it. You will not be having fery
much colour and I will not be saying that you are fery
pretty&mdash;oh, no. But you will be having the little hands and
the little ears&mdash;they will be the ears of the fairies, I am
thinking. The girl with you there, she iss a fery nice girl and
will make a fery fine wife for a handsome man&mdash;she is clefer,
oh, yes&mdash;but you haf the way and it is to you I will be
telling my story."</p>

<p>"Let her tell it," whispered Ilse. "I'm dying of curiosity to
hear about the King being spanked."</p>

<p>Emily, who realized that there was no "letting" in the case,
only a matter of lying still and listening to whatever it seemed
good to Mistress McIntyre to say, nodded.</p>

<p>"You will not be having the twa talks? I will be meaning the
Gaelic."</p>

<p>Spellbound, Emily shook her black head.</p>

<p>"That iss a pity, for my story will not be sounding so well in
the English&mdash;oh, no. You will be saying to yourself the old
woman iss having a dream, but you will be wrong, for it iss the
true story I will be telling you&mdash;oh, yess. I spanked the
King. Of course he would not be the King then&mdash;he would be
only a little prince and no more than nine years old&mdash;just the
same age as my little Alec. But it iss at the beginning I must be
or you will not be understanding the matter at all at all. It wass
all a long, long time ago, before ever we left the Old Country. My
husband would be Alistair McIntyre and he would be a shepherd near
the Balmoral Castle. Alistair was a fery handsome man and we were
fery happy. It wass not that we did not quarrel once in a
while&mdash;oh, no, that would be fery monotonous. But when we made
up it is more loving than ever we would be. And I would be fery
good-looking myself. I will be getting fatter and fatter all the
time now but I wass fery slim and peautiful then&mdash;oh, yess, it
iss the truth I will be telling you though I will be seeing that
you are laughing in your sleeves at me. When you will be eighty you
will be knowing more about it.</p>

<p>"You will be remembering maybe that Queen Victoria and Prince
Albert would be coming up to Balmoral efery summer and bringing
their children with them, and they would not be bringing any more
servants than they could help, for they would not be wanting fuss
and pother, but just a quiet, nice time like common folks. On
Sundays they would be walking down sometimes to the church in the
glen to be hearing Mr. Donald MacPherson preach. Mr. Donald
MacPherson wass fery gifted in prayer and he would not be liking it
when people would come in when he wass praying. He would be apt to
be stopping and saying, 'O Lord, we will be waiting until Sandy Big
Jim hass taken his seat'&mdash;oh, yes. I would be hearing the
Queen laugh the next day&mdash;at Sandy Big Jim, you will be
knowing, not at the minister.</p>

<p>"When they will be needing some more help at the Castle, they
just sent for me and Janet Jardine. Janet's husband was a gillie on
the estate. She would be always saying to me, 'Good-morning,
<i>Mistress</i> McIntyre' when we would be meeting and I would be
saying, 'Good-morning, <i>Janet,'</i> just to be showing the
superiority of the McIntyres over the Jardines. But she wass a fery
good creature in her place and we would be getting on fery well
together when she would not be forgetting it.</p>

<p>"I wass fery good friends with the Queen&mdash;oh, yess. She
wass not a proud woman whatefer. She would be sitting in my house
at times and drinking a cup of tea and she would be talking to me
of her children. She wass not fery handsome, oh, no, but she would
be having a fery pretty hand. Prince Albert wass fery fine looking,
so people would be saying, but to my mind Alistair wass far the
handsomer man. They would be fery fine people, whatefer, and the
little princes and princesses would be playing about with my
children efery day. The Queen would be knowing they were in good
company and she would be easier in her mind about them than I
wass&mdash;for Prince Bertie was the daring lad if efer there wass
one&mdash;oh, yess, and the tricky one&mdash;and I would be
worrying all the time for the fear he and Alec would be getting
into a scrape. They would be playing every day together&mdash;and
quarrelling, too. And it would not always be Alec's fault either.
But it wass Alec that would be getting the scolding, poor lad.
Somebody would haf to be scolded and you will be knowing that I
could not be scolding the prince, my dear.</p>

<p>"There wass one great worry I will be having&mdash;the burn
behind the house in the trees. It wass fery deep and swift in
places and if a child should be falling in he would be drowned. I
would be telling Prince Bertie and Alec time after time that they
must nefer be going near the banks of the burn. They would be doing
it once or twice for all that and I would be punishing Alec for it,
though he would be telling me that he did not want to go and Prince
Bertie would be saying, 'Oh, come on, there will not be any danger,
do not be a coward,' and Alec, he would be going because he would
be thinking he had to do what Prince Bertie wanted, and not liking
fery well either to be called a coward, and him a McIntyre. I would
be worrying so much over it that I would not be sleeping at nights.
And then, my dear, one day Prince Bertie would be falling right
into the deep pool and Alec would be trying to pull him out and
falling in after him. And they would haf been drowned together if I
had not been hearing the skirls of them when I would be coming home
from the Castle after taking some buttermilk up for the Queen. Oh,
yess, it is quick I will be taking in what had happened and running
to the burn and it will not be long before I wass fishing them out,
fery frightened and dripping. I will be knowing something had to be
done and I wass tired of blaming poor Alec, and besides it will be
truth, my dear, that I wass fery, fery mad and I wass not thinking
of princes and kings, but just of two fery bad little boys. Oh, it
iss the quick temper I will be always having&mdash;oh, yess. I will
be picking up Prince Bertie and turning him over my knee: and I
will be giving him a sound spanking on the place the Good Lord will
be making for spanks in princes as well as in common children. I
will be spanking him <i>first</i> because he wass a prince. Then I
spanked Alec and they made music together, for it wass fery angry I
was and I will be doing what my hands will be finding to do with
all my might, as the Good Book says.</p>

<p>"Then when Prince Bertie had gone home&mdash;fery
mad<i>&mdash;</i>I will be cooling off and feeling a bit
frightened. For I will not be knowing just how the Queen will be
taking it, and I will not be liking the thought of Janet Jardine
triumphing over me. But it iss a sensible woman Queen Victoria wass
and she will be telling me next day that I did right: and Prince
Albert will be smiling and joking to me about the laying on of
hands. And Prince Bertie would not be disobeying me again about
going to the burn&mdash;oh, no&mdash;and he could not be sitting
down fery easy for some time. As for Alistair, I had been thinking
he would be fery cross with me, but it will always be hard telling
what a man will think of anything&mdash;oh, yess&mdash;for he would
be laughing over it, too, and telling me that a day would come when
I could be boasting that I had spanked the King. It wass all a long
time ago now, but nefer will I be forgetting it. She would be dying
two years ago and Prince Bertie would be the king at last. When
Alistair and I came to Canada the Queen will be giving me a silk
petticoat. It wass a very fine petticoat of the Victoria tartan. I
haf nefer worn it, but I will be wearing it once&mdash;in my
coffin, oh, yess. I will be keeping it in the chest in my room and
they will be knowing what it iss for. I will be wishing Janet
Jardine could have known that I wass to be buried in a petticoat of
the Victoria tartan, but she hass been dead for a long while. She
wass a fery good sort of creature, although she wass not a
McIntyre."</p>

<p>Mistress McIntyre folded her hands and held her peace. Having
told her story she was content. Emily had listened avidly. Now she
said:</p>

<p>"Mrs. Mclntyre, will you let me write that story down, and
publish it?"</p>

<p>Mistress Mclntyre leaned forward. Her white, shrivelled face
warmed a little, her deep-set eyes shone.</p>

<p>"Will you be meaning that it will be printed in a paper?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Mistress McIntyre rearranged her shawl over her breast with
hands that trembled a little.</p>

<p>"It iss strange how our wishes will be coming true at times. It
iss a pity that the foolish people who will be saying there iss no
God could not be hearing of this. You will be writing it out and
you will be putting it into proud words&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no," said Emily quickly. "I will not do that. I may have to
make a few changes and write a framework, but most of it I shall
write exactly as you told it. I could not better it by a
syllable."</p>

<p>Mistress McIntyre looked doubtful for a moment&mdash;then
gratified.</p>

<p>"It iss only a poor, ignorant body I am, and I will not be
choosing my words fery well, but maybe you will be knowing best.
You haf listened to me fery nicely and it is sorry I am to have
kept you so long with my old tales. I will be going now and letting
you get up."</p>

<p>"Have they found the lost child?" asked Ilse eagerly.</p>

<p>Mistress McIntyre shook her head, composedly.</p>

<p>"Oh, no. It is not finding him in a hurry they will be. I will
be hearing Clara skirling in the night. She iss the daughter of my
son Angus. He will be marrying a Wilson and the Wilsons will always
be making a stramash over eferything. The poor thing will be
worrying that she was not good enough to the little lad, but it
would always be spoiling him she wass, and him that full of
mischief. I will not be of much use to her&mdash;I haf not the
second sight. You will be having a bit of that yourself, I am
thinking, oh, yess."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;no," said Emily, hurriedly. She could not help
recalling a certain incident of her childhood at New Moon, of which
she somehow never liked to think.</p>

<p>Old Mistress McIntyre nodded sagely and smoothed her white
apron.</p>

<p>"It will not be right for you to be denying it, my dear, for it
iss a great gift and my Cousin Helen four times removed will be
having it, oh, yess. But they will not be finding little Allan, oh,
no. Clara will be loving him too much. It iss not a fery good thing
to be loving any one too much. God will be a jealous God, oh, yess;
it is Margaret McIntyre who knows it. I will be having six sons
once, all fery fine men and the youngest would be Neil. He was
six-feet-two in hiss stockings and there would be none of the
others like him at all. There would be such fun in him&mdash;he
would always be laughing, oh, yess, and the wiling tongue of him
would be coaxing the birds off the bushes. He will be going to the
Klondyke and he will be getting frozen to death out there one
night, oh, yess. He will be dying while I wass praying for him. I
haf not been praying since. Clara will be feeling like that
now&mdash;she will be saying God does not hear. It iss a fery
strange thing to be a woman, my dears, and to be loving so much for
nothing. Little Allan was a fery pretty baby. He will be having a
fat little brown face and fery big blue eyes, and it is a pity he
will not be turning up, though they will not be finding my Neil in
time, oh, no. I will be leaving Clara alone and not vexing her with
comforting. I wass always the great hand to leave people
alone&mdash;without it would be when I spanked the King. It iss
Julia Hollinger who will be darkening council by words without
knowledge. It iss the foolish woman she iss. She would be leaving
her husband because he will not be giving up a dog he liked. I am
thinking he wass wise in sticking to the dog. But I will always be
getting on well with Julia because I will have learned to suffer
fools gladly. She will enjoy giving advice so much and it will not
be hurting me whatefer because I will never be taking it. I will be
saying good-bye to you now, my dears, and it iss fery glad I am to
haf seen you and I will be wishing that trouble may nefer sit on
your hearthstones. And I will not be forgetting either that you
listened to me very polite, oh, yess. I will not be of much
importance to anybody now&mdash;but once I spanked the King."</p>

<h2><a name="c15" id="c15"><i>"The Thing That Couldn't"</i></a>
</h2>

<p>When the door had closed behind Mistress McIntyre, the girls got
up and dressed rather laggingly. Emily thought of the day before
her with some distaste. The fine flavour of adventure and romance
with which they had started out had vanished, and canvassing a
country road for subscriptions had suddenly become irksome.
Physically, they were both tireder than they thought.</p>

<p>"It seems like an age since we left Shrewsbury," grumbled Ilse
as she pulled on her stockings.</p>

<p>Emily had an even stronger feeling of a long passage of time.
Her wakeful, enraptured night under the moon had seemed in itself
like a year of some strange soul-growth. And this past night had
been wakeful also, in a very different way, and she had roused from
her brief sleep at its close with an odd, rather unpleasant
sensation of some confused and troubled journey&mdash;a sensation
which old Mistress McIntyre's story had banished for a time, but
which now returned as she brushed her hair.</p>

<p>"I feel as if I had been wandering&mdash;somewhere&mdash;for
hours," she said. "And I dreamed I found little Allan&mdash;but I
don't know where. It was horrible to wake up feeling that I
<i>had</i> known just immediately before I woke and had
forgotten."</p>

<p>"I slept like a log," said Ilse, yawning. "I didn't even dream.
Emily, I want to get away from this house and this place as soon as
I can. I feel as if I were in a nightmare&mdash;as if something
horrible were pressing me down and I couldn't escape from it. It
would be different if I could <i>do</i> anything&mdash;help in any
way. But since I can't, I just want to escape from it. I forgot it
for a few minutes while the old lady was telling her
story&mdash;heartless old thing! <i>She</i> wasn't worrying one bit
about poor little lost Allan."</p>

<p>"I think she stopped worrying long ago," said Emily dreamily.
"That's what people mean when they say she isn't right. People who
don't worry a little never <i>are</i> right&mdash;like Cousin
Jimmy. But that was a great story. I'm going to write it for my
first essay&mdash;and later on I'll see about having it printed.
I'm sure it would make a splendid sketch for some magazine, if I
can only catch the savour and vivacity she put into it. I think
I'll jot down some of her expressions right away in my Jimmy-book
before I forget them."</p>

<p>"Oh, drat your Jimmy-book!" said Ilse. "Let's get down&mdash;and
eat breakfast if we have to&mdash;and get away."</p>

<p>But Emily, revelling again in her story-teller's paradise, had
temporarily forgotten everything else.</p>

<p>"Where <i>is</i> my Jimmy-book?" she said impatiently. "It isn't
in my bag&mdash;I know it was here last night. Surely I didn't
leave it on that gate-post!"</p>

<p>"Isn't that it over on the table?" asked Ilse.</p>

<p>Emily gazed blankly at it.</p>

<p>"It can't be&mdash;it <i>is</i>&mdash;how did it get there? I
<i>know</i> I didn't take it out of the bag last night."</p>

<p>"You must have," said Ilse indifferently.</p>

<p>Emily walked over to the table with a puzzled expression. The
Jimmy-book was lying open on it, with her pencil beside it.
Something on the page caught her eye suddenly. She bent over
it.</p>

<p>"Why don't you hurry and finish your hair?" demanded Ilse a few
minutes later. "I'm ready now&mdash;for pity's sake, tear yourself
from that blessed Jimmy-book for long enough to get dressed!"</p>

<p>Emily turned around, holding the Jimmy-book in her hands. She
was very pale and her eyes were dark with fear and mystery.</p>

<p>"Ilse, look at this," she said in a trembling voice.</p>

<p>Ilse went over and looked at the page of the Jimmy-book which
Emily held out to her. On it was a pencil sketch, exceedingly well
done, of the little house on the river shore to which Emily had
been so attracted on the preceding day. A black cross was marked on
a small window over the front door and opposite it, on the margin
of the Jimmy-book, beside another cross, was written:</p>

<p><i>"Allan Bradshaw is here."</i>
</p>

<p>"'What does it mean?" gasped Ilse. "Who did it?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;don't know," stammered Emily. "The writing&mdash;is
<i>mine."</i></p>

<p>Ilse looked at Emily and drew back a little.</p>

<p>"You must have drawn it in your sleep," she said dazedly.</p>

<p>"I can't draw," said Emily.</p>

<p>"Who else could have done it? Mistress McIntyre
couldn't&mdash;you know she couldn't. Emily, I never heard of such
a strange thing. Do you think&mdash;do you think&mdash;he can be
there?"</p>

<p>"How could he? The house must be locked up&mdash;there's no one
working at it now. Besides, they must have searched all around
there&mdash;he would be looking out of the window&mdash;it wasn't
shuttered, you remember&mdash;calling&mdash;they would have
seen&mdash;heard&mdash;him. I suppose I must have drawn that
picture in my sleep&mdash;though I can't understand how I did
it&mdash;because my mind was so filled with the thought of little
Allan. It's so strange&mdash;it frightens me."</p>

<p>"You'll have to show it to the Bradshaws," said Ilse.</p>

<p>"I suppose so&mdash;and yet I hate to. It may fill them with a
cruel false hope again&mdash;and there <i>can't</i> be anything in
it. But I daren't risk <i>not</i> showing it. <i>You</i> show
it&mdash;I can't, somehow. The thing has upset me&mdash;I feel
frightened&mdash;childish&mdash;I could sit down and cry. If he
<i>should</i> have been there&mdash;since Tuesday&mdash;he would be
dead of starvation."</p>

<p>"Well, they'd <i>know&mdash;</i>I'll show it, of course. If it
should turn out&mdash;Emily, you're an uncanny creature."</p>

<p>"Don't talk of it&mdash;I can't bear it," said Emily,
shuddering.</p>

<p>There was no one in the kitchen when then entered it, but
presently a young man came in&mdash;evidently the Dr. McIntyre of
whom Mrs. Hollinger had spoken. He had a pleasant, clever face,
with keen eyes behind his glasses, but he looked tired and sad.</p>

<p>"Good-morning," he said. "I hope you had a good rest and were
not disturbed in any way. We are all sadly upset here, of
course."</p>

<p>"They haven't found the little boy?" asked Ilse.</p>

<p>Dr. McIntyre shook his head.</p>

<p>"No. They have given up the search. He cannot be living
yet&mdash;after Tuesday night and last night. The swamp will not
give up its dead&mdash;I feel sure that is where he is. My poor
sister is broken-hearted. I am sorry your visit should have
happened at such a sorrowful time, but I hope Mrs. Hollinger has
made you comfortable. Grandmother McIntyre would be quite offended
if you lacked for anything. She was very famous for her hospitality
in her day. I suppose you haven't seen her. She does not often show
herself to strangers."</p>

<p>"Oh, we have seen her," said Emily absently. "She came into our
room this morning and told us how she spanked the King."</p>

<p>Dr. McIntyre laughed a little.</p>

<p>"Then you have been honoured. It is not to every one Grandmother
tells that tale. She's something of an Ancient Mariner and knows
her predestined listeners. She is a little bit strange. A few years
ago her favourite son, my Uncle Neil, met his death in the Klondyke
under sad circumstances. He was one of the Lost Patrol. Grandmother
never recovered from the shock. She has never <i>felt</i> anything
since&mdash;feeling seems to have been killed in her. She neither
loves nor hates nor fears nor hopes&mdash;she lives entirely in the
past and experiences only one emotion&mdash;a great pride in the
fact that she once spanked the King. But I am keeping you from your
breakfast&mdash;here comes Mrs. Hollinger to scold me."</p>

<p>"Wait a moment please, Dr. McIntyre," said Ilse hurriedly.
"I&mdash;you&mdash;we&mdash;there is something I want to show
you."</p>

<p>Dr. McIntyre bent a puzzled face over the Jimmy-book.</p>

<p>"What is this? I don't understand&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We don't understand it, either&mdash;Emily drew it in her
sleep."</p>

<p>"In her sleep?" Dr. McIntyre was too bewildered to be anything
but an echo.</p>

<p>"She <i>must</i> have. There was nobody else&mdash;unless your
Grandmother can draw."</p>

<p>"Not she. And she never saw this house&mdash;it's the Scobie
cottage below Malvern Bridge, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes. We saw it yesterday."</p>

<p>"But Allan can't be <i>there</i>&mdash;it's been locked for a
month&mdash;the carpenters went away in August."</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;I know," stammered Emily. "I was thinking so much of
Allan before I went to sleep&mdash;I suppose it's only a
dream&mdash;I don't understand it at all&mdash;but we <i>had</i> to
show it to you."</p>

<p>"Of course. Well, I won't say anything to Will or Clara about
it. I'll get Rob Mason from over the hill and we'll run down and
have a look around the cottage. It would be odd if&mdash;but it
couldn't possibly be. I don't see how we can get into the cottage.
It's locked and the windows are shuttered."</p>

<p>"This one&mdash;over the front door&mdash;isn't."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;but that's a closet window at the end of the upstairs
hall. I was over the house one day in August when the painters were
at work in it. The closet shuts with a spring lock, so I suppose
that is why they didn't put a shutter on that window. It's high up,
close to the ceiling, I remember. Well, I'll slip over to Rob's and
see about this. It won't do to leave any stone unturned."</p>

<p>Emily and Ilse ate what breakfast they could, thankful that Mrs.
Hollinger let them alone, save for a few passing remarks as she
came and went at work.</p>

<p>"Turrible night last night&mdash;but the rain is over. I never
closed an eye. Pore Clara didn't either, but she's quieter
now&mdash;sorter despairing. I'm skeered for her mind&mdash;her
Grandmother never was right after she heard of <i>her</i> son's
death. When Clara heard they weren't going to search no more she
screamed once and laid down on the bed with her face to the
wall&mdash;hain't stirred since. Well, the world has to go on for
other folks. Help yourselves to the toast. I'd advise ye not to be
in too much of a hurry starting out till the wind dries the mud a
bit."</p>

<p>"I'm not going to go until we find out if&mdash;" whispered Ilse
inconclusively.</p>

<p>Emily nodded. She could not eat, and if Aunt Elizabeth or Aunt
Ruth had seen her they would have sent her to bed at once with
orders to stay there&mdash;and they would have been quite right.
She had almost reached her breaking-point. The hour that passed
after Dr. McIntyre's departure seemed interminable. Suddenly they
heard Mrs. Hollinger, who was washing milk-pails at the bench
outside the kitchen door, give a sharp exclamation. A minute later
she rushed into the kitchen, followed by Dr. McIntyre, breathless
from his mad run from Malvern Bridge.</p>

<p>"Clara must be told first," he said. "It is her right."</p>

<p>He disappeared into the inner room. Mrs. Hollinger dropped into
a chair, laughing and crying.</p>

<p>"They've found him&mdash;they've found little Allan&mdash;on the
floor of the hall closet&mdash;in the Scobie cottage!"</p>

<p>"Is&mdash;he&mdash;living?" gasped Emily.</p>

<p>"Yes, but no more&mdash;he couldn't even speak&mdash;but he'll
come round with care, the doctor says. They carried him to the
nearest house&mdash;that's all the doctor had time to tell me."</p>

<p>A wild cry of joy came from the bedroom&mdash;and Clara
Bradshaw, with dishevelled hair and pallid lips, but with the light
of rapture shining in her eyes, rushed through the
kitchen&mdash;out and over the hill. Mrs. Hollinger caught up a
coat and ran after her. Dr. McIntyre sank into a chair.</p>

<p>"I couldn't stop her&mdash;-and I'm not fit for another run
yet&mdash;but joy doesn't kill. It would have been cruel to stop
her, even if I could."</p>

<p>"Is little Allan all right?" asked Ilse.</p>

<p>"He will be. The poor kid was at the point of exhaustion,
naturally. He wouldn't have lasted for another day. We carried him
right up to Dr. Matheson at the Bridge and left him in his charge.
He won't be fit to be brought home before to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Have you any idea how he came to be there?"</p>

<p>"Well, he couldn't tell us anything, of course, but I think I
know how it happened. We found a cellar window about half an inch
open. I fancy that Allan was poking about the house, boy fashion,
and found that this window hadn't been fastened. He must have got
entrance by it, pushed it almost shut behind him and then explored
the house. He had pulled the closet door tight in some way and the
spring lock made him a prisoner. The window was too high for him to
reach or he might have attracted attention from it. The white
plaster of the closet wall is all marked and scarred with his vain
attempts to get up to the window. Of course, he must have shouted,
but nobody has ever been near enough the house to hear him. You
know, it stands in that bare little cove with nothing near it where
a child could be hidden, so I suppose the searchers did not pay
much attention to it. They didn't search the river banks until
yesterday, anyhow, because it was never thought he would have gone
away down there alone, and by yesterday he was past calling for
help."</p>

<p>"I'm so&mdash;happy&mdash;since he's found," said Ilse, winking
back tears of relief.</p>

<p>Grandfather Bradshaw suddenly poked his head out of the
sitting-room doorway.</p>

<p>"I told ye a child <i>couldn't</i> be lost in the nineteenth
century," he chuckled.</p>

<p>"He <i>was</i> lost, though," said Dr. McIntyre, "and he
wouldn't have been found&mdash;in time&mdash;if it were not for
this young lady. It's a very extraordinary thing."</p>

<p>"Emily is&mdash;psychic," said Ilse, quoting Mr. Carpenter.</p>

<p>"Psychic! Humph! Well, it's curious&mdash;very. I don't pretend
to understand it. Grandmother would say it was second sight, of
course. Naturally, she's a firm believer in that, like all the
Highland folk."</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;I'm sure I haven't second sight," protested Emily. "I
must just have dreamed it&mdash;and got up in my sleep&mdash;but,
then, I can't draw."</p>

<p>"Something used you as an instrument then," said Dr. McIntyre.
"After all, Grandmother's explanation of second sight is just as
reasonable as anything else, when one is compelled to believe an
unbelievable thing."</p>

<p>"I'd rather not talk of it," said Emily, with a shiver. "I'm so
glad Allan has been found&mdash;but <i>please</i> don't tell people
about my part in it. Let them think it just occurred to you to
search inside the Scobie house. I&mdash;I couldn't bear to have
this talked of all over the country."</p>

<p>When they left the little white house on the windy hill the sun
was breaking through the clouds and the harbour waters were dancing
madly in it. The landscape was full of the wild beauty that comes
in the wake of a spent storm and the Western Road stretched before
them in loop and hill and dip of wet, red allurement; but Emily
turned away from it.</p>

<p>"I'm going to leave it for my next trip," she said. "I can't go
canvassing to-day, somehow. Friend of my heart, let's go to Malvern
Bridge and take the morning train to Shrewsbury."</p>

<p>"It&mdash;was&mdash;awfully funny&mdash;about your dream," said
Ilse. "It makes me a little afraid of you,
Emily&mdash;somehow."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't be afraid of me," implored Emily. "It was only a
coincidence. I was thinking of him so much&mdash;and the house took
possession of me yesterday&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Remember how you found out about Mother?" said Ilse, in a low
tone. "You <i>have</i> some power the rest of us haven't."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I'll grow out of it," said Emily desperately. "I hope
so&mdash;I don't <i>want</i> to have any such power&mdash;you don't
know how I feel about it, Ilse. It seems to me a terrible
thing&mdash;as if I were marked out in some uncanny way&mdash;I
don't feel <i>human.</i> When Dr. McIntyre spoke about
<i>something</i> using me as an instrument, I went cold all over.
It seemed to me that while <i>I</i> was asleep some <i>other</i>
intelligence must have taken possession of my body and drawn that
picture."</p>

<p>"It was <i>your</i> writing," said Ilse.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm not going to talk of it&mdash;or <i>think</i> of it.
I'm going to forget it. Don't ever speak of it to me again,
Ilse."</p>

not printed. Typewriting doesn't seem <i>quite</i> as insulting as
print, some way.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"We have read your story with interest, and regret to say that
we cannot accept it for publication at the present time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>"If they meant that 'with interest,' it is a little
encouragement. But were they only trying to soften the blow?</p>

<p>"Ilse and I were notified recently that there were nine
vacancies in the <i>Skull and Owl</i> and that we had been put on
the list of those who might apply for membership. So we did. It is
considered a great thing in school to be a Skull and Owl.</p>

<p>"The Junior year is in full swing now, and I find the work very
interesting. Mr. Hardy has several of our classes, and I like him
as a teacher better than anyone since Mr. Carpenter. He was very
much interested in my essay, <i>The Woman Who Spanked the King.</i>
He gave it first place and commented on it specially in his class
criticisms. Evelyn Blake is sure, naturally, that I copied it out
of something, and feels certain she has read it somewhere before.
Evelyn is wearing her hair in the new pompadour style this year and
I think it is very unbecoming to her. But then, of course, the only
part of Evelyn's anatomy I like is her back.</p>

<p>"I understand that the Martin clan are furious with me. Sally
Martin was married last week in the Anglican church here, and the
<i>Times</i> editor asked me to report it. Of course, I
went&mdash;though I <i>hate</i> reporting weddings. There are so
many things I'd <i>like</i> to say sometimes that can't <i>be</i>
said. But Sally's wedding was pretty and so was she, and I sent in
quite a nice report of it, I thought, especially mentioning the
bride's beautiful bouquet of 'roses and orchids'&mdash;the first
bridal bouquet of orchids ever seen in Shrewsbury. I wrote as plain
as print and there was no excuse whatever for that wretched
typesetter on the <i>Times</i> turning 'orchids' into
<i>sardines.</i> Of course, anybody with any sense would have known
that it was only a printer's error. But the Martin clan have taken
into their heads the absurd notion that I wrote <i>sardines</i> on
purpose for a silly joke&mdash;because, it seems, it has been
reported to them that I said once I was tired of the conventional
reports of weddings and would like to write just one along
different lines. I <i>did</i> say it&mdash;but my craving for
originality would hardly lead me to report the bride as carrying a
bouquet of sardines! Nevertheless, the Martins <i>do</i> think it,
and Stella Martin didn't invite me to her thimble party&mdash;and
Aunt Ruth says she doesn't wonder at it&mdash;and Aunt Elizabeth
says I shouldn't have been so careless. <i>I</i>! Heaven grant me
patience!</p>

<p>"Mrs. Will Bradshaw came to see me this evening.</p>

<p>Luckily Aunt Ruth was out&mdash;I say luckily, for I don't want
Aunt Ruth to find out about my dream and its part in finding little
Allan Bradshaw. This may be 'sly,' as Aunt Ruth would say, but the
truth is that, sly or not sly, I could <i>not</i> bear to have Aunt
Ruth sniffing and wondering and pawing over the incident.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Bradshaw came to thank me. It embarrassed
me&mdash;because, after all, what had <i>I</i> to do with it? I
don't want to think of or talk of it at all. Mrs. Bradshaw says
little Allan is all right again, now, though it was a week after
they found him before he could sit up. She was very pale and
earnest.</p>

<p>"'He would have died there if you hadn't come, Miss
Starr&mdash;and <i>I</i> would have died. I couldn't have gone on
living&mdash;not knowing&mdash;oh, I shall never forget the horror
of those days. I <i>had</i> to come and try to utter a little of my
gratitude&mdash;you were gone when I came back that morning&mdash;I
felt that I had been very inhospitable&mdash;'</p>

<p>"She broke down and cried&mdash;and so did I&mdash;and we had a
good howl together. I am very glad and thankful that Allan was
found, but I shall never like to think of the way it happened.</p>

<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

<p>"New Moon,</p>

<p>"October 7, 19&mdash;</p>

<p>"I had a lovely walk and prowl this evening in the pond
graveyard. Not exactly a cheerful place for an evening's ramble,
one might suppose. But I always like to wander over that little
westward slope of graves in the gentle melancholy of a fine autumn
evening. I like to read the names on the stones and note the ages
and think of all the loves and hates and hopes and fears that lie
buried there. It was beautiful&mdash;and not sad. And all around
were the red ploughed fields and the frosted, ferny woodsides and
all the old familiar things I have loved&mdash;and love more and
more it seems to me, the older I grow. Every week-end I come home
to New Moon these things seem dearer to me&mdash;more a part of me.
I love <i>things</i> just as much as <i>people.</i> I think Aunt
Elizabeth is like this, too. That is why she will not have anything
changed at New Moon. I am beginning to understand her better. I
believe she likes me now, too. I was only a duty at first, but now
I am something more.</p>

<p>"I stayed in the graveyard until a dull gold twilight came down
and made a glimmering spectral place of it. Then Teddy came for me
and we walked together up the field and through the To-morrow Road.
It is really a To-day Road now, for the trees along it are above
our heads, but we still call it the To-morrow Road&mdash;partly out
of habit and partly because we talk so much on it of <i>our</i>
to-morrows and what we hope to do in them. Somehow, Teddy is the
only person I like to talk to about my to-morrows and my ambitions.
There is no one else. Perry scoffs at my literary aspirations. He
says, when I say anything about writing books, 'What is the good of
that sort of thing?' And of course if a person can't see 'the good'
for himself you can't explain it to him. I can't even talk to Dean
about them&mdash;not since he said so bitterly one evening, 'I hate
to hear of your to-morrows&mdash;they cannot be <i>my</i>
tomorrows.' I think in a way Dean doesn't like to think of my
growing up&mdash;I <i>think</i> he has a little of the Priest
jealousy of sharing <i>anything,</i> especially friendship, with
anyone else&mdash;or with the world. I feel thrown back on myself.
Somehow, it has seemed to me lately that Dean isn't interested any
longer in my writing ambitions. He even, it seems to me, ridicules
them slightly. For instance, Mr. Carpenter was delighted with my
<i>Woman Who Spanked the King,</i> and told me it was excellent;
but when Dean read it he smiled and said, 'It will do very well for
a school essay, but&mdash;' and then he smiled again. It was not
the smile I liked, either. It had 'too much Priest in it,' as Aunt
Elizabeth would say. I felt&mdash;and feel&mdash;horribly cast down
about it. It seemed to say, 'You can scribble amusingly, my dear,
and have a pretty knack of phrase-turning; but I should be doing
you an unkindness if I let you think that such a knack meant a very
great deal.' If this is true&mdash;and it very likely is, for Dean
is so clever and knows so much&mdash;then I can never accomplish
anything worth while. I won't <i>try</i> to accomplish
anything&mdash;I <i>won't</i> be just a 'pretty scribbler.'</p>

<p>"But it's different with Teddy."</p>

<p>"Teddy was wildly elated to-night&mdash;and so was I when I
heard his news. He showed two of his pictures at the Charlottetown
exhibition in September, and Mr. Lewes, of Montreal, has offered
him fifty dollars apiece for them. That will pay his board in
Shrewsbury for the winter and make it easier for Mrs. Kent.
Although <i>she</i> wasn't glad when he told her. She said, 'Oh,
yes, you think you are independent of me now'&mdash;and cried.
Teddy was hurt, because he had never thought of such a thing. Poor
Mrs. Kent. She must be very lonely. There is some strange barrier
between her and her kind. I haven't been to the Tansy Patch for a
long, long time. Once in the summer I went with Aunt Laura, who had
heard Mrs. Kent was ill. Mrs. Kent was able to be up and she talked
to Aunt Laura, but she never spoke to me, only looked at me now and
then with a queer, smouldering fire in her eyes. But when we rose
to come away, she spoke once&mdash;and said,</p>

<p>"'You are very tall. You will soon be a woman&mdash;and stealing
some other woman's son from her.'</p>

<p>"Aunt Laura said, as we walked home, that Mrs. Kent had always
been strange, but was growing stranger.</p>

<p>"'Some people think her mind is affected,' she said.</p>

<p>"'I don't think the trouble is in her mind. She has a sick
soul,' I said.</p>

<p>"'Emily, dear, that is a dreadful thing to say,' said Aunt
Laura.</p>

<p>"I don't see why. If bodies and minds can be sick, can't souls
be, too? There are times when I feel as certain as if I had been
told it that Mrs. Kent got some kind of terrible soul-wound some
time, and it has never healed. I wish she didn't hate me. It hurts
me to have Teddy's mother hate me. I don't know why this is. Dean
is just as dear a friend as Teddy, yet I wouldn't care if all the
rest of the Priest clan hated me.</p>

<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

<p>"October 19, 19&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ilse and the other seven applicants were elected Skulls and
Owls. I was black-beaned. We were notified to that effect
Monday.</p>

<p>"Of course, I know it was Evelyn Blake who did it. There is
nobody else who would do it. Ilse was furious: she tore into pieces
the notification of her election and sent the scraps back to the
secretary with a scathing repudiation of the <i>Skull and Owl</i>
and all its works.</p>

<p>"Evelyn met me in the cloakroom to-day and assured me that she
had voted for both Ilse and me.</p>

<p>"'Has anyone been saying you did not?' I asked, in my best Aunt
Elizabethan manner.</p>

<p>"'Yes&mdash;Ilse has,' said Evelyn peevishly. 'She was very
insolent to me about it. Do you want to know who I <i>think</i> put
the black bean in?'</p>

<p>"I looked Evelyn straight in the eyes.</p>

<p>"'No, it is not necessary. I <i>know</i> who put it
in'&mdash;and I turned and left her.</p>

<p>"Most of the Skulls and Owls are very angry about
it&mdash;especially the Skulls. One or two Owls, I have heard, hoot
that it is a good pill for the Murray pride. And, of course,
several Seniors and Juniors who were not among the favoured nine
are either gloatingly rejoiced or odiously sympathetic.</p>

<p>"Aunt Ruth heard of it to-day and wanted to know <i>why</i> I
was black-beaned.</p>

<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

<p>"New Moon,</p>

<p>"November 5, 19&mdash;</p>

<p>"Aunt Laura and I spent this afternoon, the one teaching, the
other learning, a certain New Moon tradition&mdash;to wit, how to
put pickles into glass jars in patterns. We stowed away the whole
big crockful of new pickles, and when Aunt Elizabeth came to look
them over she admitted she could not tell those which Aunt Laura
had done from mine.</p>

<p>"This evening was very delightful. I had a good time with
myself, out in the garden. It was lovely there to-night with the
eerie loveliness of a fine November evening. At sunset there had
been a wild little shower of snow, but it had cleared off, leaving
the world just lightly covered, and the air clear and tingling.
Almost all the flowers, including my wonderful asters, which were a
vision all through the fall, were frozen black two weeks ago, but
the beds still had white drifts of alyssum all around them. A big,
smoky-red hunter's moon was just rising above the tree-tops. There
was a yellow-red glow in the west behind the white hills on which a
few dark trees grew. The snow had banished all the strange deep
sadness of a dead landscape on a late fall evening, and the slopes
and meadows of old New Moon farm were transformed into a wonderland
in the faint, early moonlight. The old house had a coating of
sparkling snow on its roof. Its lighted windows glowed like jewels.
It looked exactly like a picture on a Christmas card. There was
just a suggestion of grey-blue chimney smoke over the kitchen. A
nice reek of burning autumn leaves came from Cousin Jimmy's
smouldering bonfires in the lane. My cats were there, too,
stealthy, goblin-eyed, harmonizing with the hour and the place. The
twilight&mdash;appropriately called the cats' light&mdash;is the
only time when a cat really reveals himself. Saucy Sal was thin and
gleaming, like the silvery ghost of a pussy. Daff was like a
dark-grey, skulking tiger. He certainly gives the world assurance
of a cat: he doesn't condescend to every one&mdash;and he never
talks too much. They pounced at my feet and tore off and frisked
back and rolled each other over&mdash;and were all so a part of the
night and the haunted place that they didn't disturb my thoughts at
all. I walked up and down the paths and around the dial and the
summer-house in exhilaration. Air such as I breathed then always
makes me a little drunk, I verily believe. I laughed at myself for
feeling badly over not being elected an <i>Owl.</i> An Owl! Why, I
felt like a young eagle, soaring sunward. All the world was before
me to see and learn, and I exulted in it. The future was
mine&mdash;and the past, too. I felt as if I had been alive here
always&mdash;as if I shared in all the loves and lives of the old
house. I felt as if I would live
always&mdash;always&mdash;always&mdash;I was sure of immortality
then. I didn't just believe it&mdash;I <i>felt</i> it.</p>

<p>"Dean found me there: he was close beside me before I was aware
of his presence.</p>

<p>"'You are smiling,' said Dean. 'I like to see a woman smiling to
herself. Her thoughts must be innocent and pleasant. Has the day
been kind to you, dear lady?'</p>

<p>"'Very kind&mdash;and this evening is its best gift. I'm
<i>so</i> happy to-night, Dean&mdash;just to be alive makes me
happy. I feel as if I were driving a team of stars. I wish such a
mood could last, I feel so sure of myself to-night&mdash;so sure of
my future. I'm not afraid of <i>anything.</i> At life's banquet of
success I may not be the guest of honour, but I'll be among those
present.'</p>

<p>"'You looked like a seeress gazing into the future as I came
down the walk,' said Dean, 'standing here in the moonlight, white
and rapt. Your skin is like a narcissus petal. You could dare to
hold a white rose against your face&mdash;very few women can dare
that. You aren't really very pretty, you know, Star, but your face
makes people think of beautiful things&mdash;and that is a far
rarer gift than mere beauty.'</p>

<p>"I like Dean's compliments. They are always different from
anybody else's. And I like to be called a woman.</p>

<p>"'You'll make me vain,' I said.</p>

<p>"'Not with your sense of humour,' said Dean. 'A woman with a
sense of humour is never vain. The most malevolent bad fairy in the
world couldn't bestow two such drawbacks on the same christened
babe.'</p>

<p>"'Do you call a sense of humour a drawback?' I asked.</p>

<p>"'To be sure it is. A woman who has a sense of humour possesses
no refuge from the merciless truth about herself. She cannot think
herself misunderstood. She cannot revel in self-pity. She cannot
comfortably damn anyone who differs from her. No, Emily, the woman
with a sense of humour isn't to be envied.'</p>

<p>"This view of it hadn't occurred to me. We sat down on the stone
bench and thrashed it out. Dean is not going away this winter. I am
glad&mdash;I would miss him horribly. If I can't have a good spiel
with Dean at least once a fortnight, life seems faded. There's so
much <i>colour</i> in our talks; and then at times he can be so
eloquently quiet. Part of the time tonight he was like that: we
just sat there in the dream and dusk and quiet of the old garden
and <i>heard</i> each other's thoughts. Part of the time he told me
tales of old lands and the gorgeous bazaars of the East. Part of
the time he asked me about myself, and my studies and my doings. I
like a man who gives me a chance now and then to talk about
myself.</p>

<p>"'What have you been reading lately?' he asked.</p>

<p>"'This afternoon, after I finished the pickles, I read several
of Mrs. Browning's poems. We have her in our English work this
year, you know. My favourite poem is <i>The Lay of the Brown
Rosary&mdash;</i>and I am much more in sympathy with <i>Onora</i>
than Mrs. Browning was.'</p>

<p>"'You would be,' said Dean. 'That is because you are a creature
of emotion yourself. <i>You</i> would barter heaven for love, just
as <i>Onora</i> did.'</p>

<p>"'I will not love&mdash;to love is to be a slave,' I said.</p>

<p>"And the minute I said it I was ashamed of saying
it&mdash;because I knew I had just said it to sound clever. I don't
really believe that to love is to be a slave&mdash;not with
Murrays, anyhow. But Dean took me quite seriously.</p>

<p>"'Well, one must be a slave to <i>something</i> in this kind of
a world,' he said. 'No one is free. Perhaps, after all, O daughter
of the Stars, love is the easiest master&mdash;easier than
hate&mdash;or fear&mdash;or necessity&mdash;or ambition&mdash;or
pride. By the way, how are you getting on with the love-making
parts of your stories?'</p>

<p>"'You forget&mdash;I can't write stories just now. When I
can&mdash;well, you know long ago you promised you would teach me
how to make love artistically.'</p>

<p>"I said it in a teasing way, just for a joke. But Dean seemed
suddenly to become very much in earnest.</p>

<p>"'Are you ready for the teaching?' he said, bending forward.</p>

<p>"For one crazy moment I really thought he was going to kiss me.
I drew back&mdash;I felt myself flushing&mdash;all at once I
thought of Teddy. I didn't know what to say&mdash;I picked up
Daff&mdash;buried my face in his beautiful fur&mdash;listened to
his inner purring. At that opportune moment Aunt Elizabeth came to
the front door and wanted to know if I had my rubbers on. I
hadn't&mdash;so I went in&mdash;and Dean went home. I watched him
from my window, limping down the lane. He seemed very lonely, and
all at once I felt terribly sorry for him. When I'm with Dean he's
such good company, and we have such good times that I forget there
must be another side to his life. I can fill only such a little
corner of it. The rest must be very empty.</p>

<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

<p>"November 14, 19&mdash;</p>

<p>"There is a fresh scandal about Emily of New Moon plus Ilse of
Blair Water. I have just had an unpleasant interview with Aunt Ruth
and must write it all out to rid my soul of bitterness. Such a
tempest in a teapot over nothing! But Ilse and I <i>do</i> have the
worst luck.</p>

<p>"I spent last Thursday evening with Ilse studying our English
literature together. We did an evening of honest work and I left
for home at nine. Ilse came out to the gate with me. It was a soft,
dark, gentle, starry night. Ilse's new boarding-house is the last
house on Cardigan-street, and beyond it the road veers over the
little creek bridge into the park. We could see the park, dim and
luring, in the starlight.</p>

<p>"'Let's go for a walk around it before you go home,' proposed
Ilse.</p>

<p>"We went: of course, I shouldn't have: I should have come right
home to bed, like any good consumptive. But I had just completed my
autumnal course of cod-liver emulsion&mdash;ugh!&mdash;and thought
I might defy the night air for once. So&mdash;we went. And it was
delightful. Away over the harbour we heard the windy music of the
November hills, but among the trees of the park it was calm and
still. We left the road and wandered up a little side trail through
the spicy fragrant evergreens on the hill. The firs and pines are
always friendly, but they tell you no secrets as maples and poplars
do: they never reveal their mysteries&mdash;never betray their
long-guarded lore&mdash;and so, of course, they are more
interesting than any other trees.</p>

<p>"The whole hillside was full of nice, elfish sounds and cool,
elusive night smells&mdash;balsam and frosted fern. We seemed to be
in the very heart of a peaceful hush. The night put her arms around
us like a mother and drew us close together. We told each other
everything. Of course, next day I repented me of this&mdash;though
Ilse is a very satisfactory confidante and never betrays anything,
even in her rages. But then it is not a Murray tradition to turn
your soul inside out, even to your dearest friend. But darkness and
fir balsam make people do such things. And we had lots of fun,
too&mdash;Ilse is such an exhilarating companion. You're never dull
a moment in her company. Altogether we had a lovely walk and came
out of the park feeling dearer to each other than ever, with
another beautiful memory to share. Just at the bridge we met Teddy
and Perry coming off the Western Road. They'd been out for a
constitutional hike. It happens to be one of the times Ilse and
Perry are on speaking terms, so we all walked across the bridge
together and then they went their way and we went ours. I was in
bed and asleep by ten o'clock.</p>

<p>"But somebody saw us walking across the bridge. Next day it was
all through the school: day after that all through the town: that
Isle and I had been prowling in the park with Teddy Kent and Perry
Miller till twelve o'clock at night. Aunt Ruth heard it and
summoned me to the bar of judgment to-night. I told her the whole
story, but of course she didn't believe it.</p>

<p>"'You know I was home at a quarter to ten last Thursday night,
Aunt Ruth,' I said.</p>

<p>"'I suppose the time was exaggerated,' admitted Aunt Ruth. 'But
there must have been <i>something</i> to start such a story.
There's no smoke without <i>some</i> fire. Emily, you are treading
in your mother's footsteps.'</p>

<p>"'Suppose we leave my mother out of the question&mdash;she's
dead,' I said. 'The point is, Aunt Ruth, do you believe me or do
you not?'</p>

<p>"'I don't believe it was as bad as the report,' Aunt Ruth said
reluctantly. 'But you have got yourself talked about. Of course,
you must expect that, as long as you run with Ilse Burnley and
off-scourings of the gutter like Perry Miller. Andrew wanted you to
go for a walk in the park last Friday evening and you
refused&mdash;I heard you. That would have been too respectable, of
course.'</p>

<p>"'Exactly,' I said. 'That was the very reason. There's no fun in
anything that's too respectable.'</p>

<p>"'Impertinence, Miss, is not wit,' said Aunt Ruth.</p>

<p>"I didn't mean to be impertinent, but it does annoy me to have
Andrew flung in my teeth like that. Andrew is going to be one of my
problems. Dean thinks it's great fun&mdash;<i>he</i> knows what is
in the wind as well as I do. He is always teasing me about my
red-headed young man&mdash;my r.h.y.m. for short.</p>

<p>"'He's almost a rhyme,' said Dean.</p>

<p>"'But never a poem,' said I.</p>

<p>"Certainly poor, good, dear Andrew is the stodgiest of prose.
Yet I'd like him well enough if the whole Murray clan weren't
literally throwing him at my head. They want to get me safely
engaged before I'm old enough to elope, and who so safe as Andrew
Murray?</p>

<p>"Oh, as Dean says, nobody is free&mdash;never, except just for a
few brief moments now and then, when the flash comes, or when, as
on my haystack night, the soul slips over into eternity for a
little space. All the rest of our years we are slaves to
something&mdash;traditions&mdash;conventions&mdash;ambitions&mdash;<i>relations.</i>
And sometimes, as tonight, I think that last is the hardest bondage
of all.</p>

<p>"New Moon,</p>

<p>"December 3, 19&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am here in my own dear room, with a fire in my little
fireplace by the grace of Aunt Elizabeth. An open fire is always
lovely, but it is ten times lovelier on a stormy night. I watched
the storm from my window until darkness fell. There is a singular
charm in snow coming gently down in slanting lines against dark
trees. I wrote a description of it in my Jimmy-book as I watched. A
wind has come up since and now my room is full of the soft forlorn
sigh of snow, driving through Lofty John's spruce wood. It is one
of the loveliest sounds in the world. Some sounds <i>are</i> so
exquisite&mdash;far more exquisite than anything <i>seen.</i>
Daff's purr there on my rug, for instance&mdash;and the snap and
crackle of the fire&mdash;and the squeaks and scrambles of mice
that are having a jamboree behind the wainscot. I love to be alone
in my room like this. I like to think even the mice are having a
good time. And I get so much pleasure out of all my little
belongings. They have a meaning for me they have for no one else. I
have never for one moment felt at home in my room at Aunt Ruth's,
but as soon as I come <i>here</i> I enter into my kingdom. I love
to read here&mdash;dream here&mdash;sit by the window and shape
some airy fancy into verse.</p>

<p>"I've been reading one of Father's books to-night. I always feel
so beautifully near to Father when I read his books&mdash;as if I
might suddenly look over my shoulder and see him. And so often I
come across his pencilled notes on the margin and they seem like a
message from him. The book I'm reading to-night is a wonderful
one&mdash;wonderful in plot and conception&mdash;wonderful in its
grasp of motives and passions. As I read it I feel humbled and
insignificant&mdash;which is good for me. I say to myself, 'You
poor, pitiful, little creature, did you ever imagine <i>you</i>
could write? If so, your delusion is now stripped away from you for
ever and you behold yourself in your naked paltriness.' But I shall
recover from this state of mind&mdash;and believe again that I
<i>can</i> write a little&mdash;and go on cheerfully producing
sketches and poems until I can do better. In another year and a
half my promise to Aunt Elizabeth will be out and I can write
stories again. Meanwhile&mdash;patience! To be sure, I get a bit
weary at times of saying 'patience and perseverance.' It is hard
not to see all at once the results of those estimable virtues.
Sometimes I feel that I want to tear around and be as impatient as
I like. But not to-night. To-night I feel as contented as a cat on
a rug. I would purr if I knew how.</p>

<p>"December 9, 19&mdash;</p>

<p>"This was Andrew-night. He came, all beautifully groomed up, as
usual. Of course, I like a boy who gets himself up well, but Andrew
really carries it too far. He always seems as if he had just been
starched and ironed and was afraid to move or laugh for fear he'd
crack. When I come to think of it, I've never heard Andrew give a
hearty laugh yet. And I <i>know</i> he never hunted pirate gold
when he was a boy. But he's good and sensible and tidy, and his
nails are always clean, and the bank manager thinks a great deal of
him. And he likes cats&mdash;in their place! Oh, I don't deserve
such a cousin!"</p>

<p>"Holidays are over. I had a beautiful two weeks at old
white-hooded New Moon. The day before Christmas I had <i>five
acceptances.</i> I wonder I didn't go crazy. Three of them were
from magazines who don't pay anything, but subscriptions, for
contributions. But the others were accompanied by
<i>cheques</i>&mdash;one for two dollars for a poem and one for ten
dollars for my <i>Sands of Time,</i> which has been taken at
last&mdash;my first story acceptance. Aunt Elizabeth looked at the
cheques and said wonderingly:</p>

<p>"'Do you suppose the bank will really pay you <i>money</i> for
those?'</p>

<p>"She could hardly believe it, even after Cousin Jimmy took them
to Shrewsbury and cashed them.</p>

<p>"Of course, the money goes to my Shrewsbury expenses. But I had
no end of fun planning how I would have spent it if I had been free
to spend.</p>

<p>"Perry is on the High School team who will debate with the
Queen's Academy boys in February. Good for Perry&mdash;it's a great
honour to be chosen on that team. The debate is a yearly occurrence
and Queen's has won for three years. Ilse offered to coach Perry on
the elocution of his speech and she is taking no end of trouble
with him&mdash;especially in preventing him from saying
<i>'devilopment'</i> when he means 'development.' It's awfully good
of her, for she really doesn't like him. I do hope Shrewsbury will
win.</p>

<p>"We have <i>The Idylls of the King</i> in English class this
term. I like some things in them, but I detest Tennyson's
<i>Arthur.</i> If I had been <i>Guinevere</i> I'd have boxed his
ears&mdash;but I wouldn't have been unfaithful to him for
<i>Lancelot,</i> who was just as odious in a different way. As for
<i>Geraint,</i> if I had been <i>Enid</i> I'd have <i>bitten</i>
him. These 'patient Griseldas' deserve all they get. Lady Enid, if
you had been a Murray of New Moon you would have kept your husband
in better order and he would have liked you all the better for
it.</p>

<p>"I read a story to-night. It ended unhappily. I was wretched
until I had invented a happy ending for it. I shall always end
<i>my</i> stories happily. I don't care whether it's 'true to life'
or not. It's true to life as it <i>should be</i> and that's a
better truth than the other.</p>

<p>"Speaking of books. I read an old one of Aunt Ruth's the other
day&mdash;The <i>Children of the Abbey.</i> The heroine fainted in
every chapter and cried quarts if any one looked at her. But as for
the trials and persecutions she underwent, in spite of her delicate
frame, their name was Legion and no fair maiden of these degenerate
days could survive half of them&mdash;not even the newest of new
women. I laughed over the book until I amazed Aunt Ruth, who
thought it a very sad volume. It is the only novel in Aunt Ruth's
house. One of her beaux gave it to her when she was young. It seems
impossible to think that Aunt Ruth ever had beaux. Uncle Dutton
seems an unreality, and even his picture on the crepe-draped easel
in the parlour cannot convince me of his existence.</p>

<p>"January 21, 19&mdash;</p>

<p>"Friday night the debate between Shrewsbury High and Queen's
came off. The Queen's boys came up believing they were going to
come, see and conquer&mdash;and went home like the proverbial dogs
with carefully adjusted tails. It was really Perry's speech that
won the debate. He was a wonder. Even Aunt Ruth admitted for the
first time that there was something in him. After it was over he
came rushing up to Ilse and me in the corridor.</p>

<p>"'Didn't I do great, Emily?' he demanded. 'I knew it was in me,
but I didn't know if I could get it out. When I got up at first I
felt tongue-tied&mdash;and then I saw <i>you,</i> looking at me as
if you said, 'You can&mdash;you <i>must'</i>&mdash;and I went ahead
full steam. <i>You</i> won that debate, Emily.'</p>

<p>"Now wasn't that a nice thing to say before Ilse, who had worked
for hours with him and drilled and slaved? Never a word of tribute
to <i>her</i>&mdash;everything to me who hadn't done a thing except
look interested.</p>

<p>"'Perry, you're an ungrateful barbarian,' I said&mdash;and left
him there, with his jaw dropping. Ilse was so furious she cried.
She has never spoken to him since&mdash;and that ass of a Perry
can't understand why.</p>

<p>"'What's she peeved about now? I <i>thanked</i> her for all her
trouble at our last practice,' he says.</p>

<p>"Certainly, Stovepipe Town has its limitations.</p>

<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

<p>"February 2, 19&mdash;</p>

<p>"Last night Mrs. Rogers invited Aunt Ruth and me to dinner to
meet her sister and brother-in-law, Mr. and Mrs. Herbert. Aunt Ruth
had her Sunday scallops in her hair and wore her brown velvet dress
that reeked of moth-balls and her big oval brooch with Uncle
Dutton's hair in it; and I put on my ashes-of-roses and Princess
Mena's necklace and went, quivering with excitement, for Mr.
Herbert is a member of the Dominion Cabinet and a man who stands in
the presence of kings. He has a massive, silver head and eyes that
have looked into people's thoughts so long that you have an uncanny
feeling that they can see right into your soul and read motives you
don't dare avow even to yourself. His face is a most interesting
one. There is so much in it. All the varied experiences of his
full, wonderful life had written it over. One could tell at sight
that he was a born leader. Mrs. Rogers let me sit beside him at
dinner. I was afraid to speak&mdash;afraid I'd say something
stupid&mdash;afraid I'd make some ludicrous mistake. So I just sat
quiet as a mouse and listened adoringly. Mrs. Rogers told me to-day
that Mr. Herbert said, after we had left,</p>

<p>"'That little Starr girl of New Moon is the best
conversationalist of any girl of her age I ever met.'</p>

<p>"So even great statesmen&mdash;but there&mdash;I won't be
horrid.</p>

<p>"And he <i>was</i> splendid: he was wise and witty and humorous.
I felt as if I were drinking in some rare, stimulating, mental
wine. I forgot even Aunt Ruth's moth-balls. What an event it is to
meet such a man and take a peep through his wise eyes at the
fascinating game of empire building!</p>

<p>"Perry went to the station to-day to get a glimpse of Mr.
Herbert. Perry says he will be just as great a man some day. But,
no. Perry can&mdash;and I believe will&mdash;go far&mdash;climb
high. But he will be only a successful politician&mdash;never a
statesman. Ilse flew into me when I said this.</p>

<p>"'I hate Perry Miller,' she fumed, 'but I hate snobbery worse.
<i>You're</i> a snob, Emily Starr. You think just because Perry
comes from Stovepipe Town that he can never be a great man. If he
had been one of the sacred Murrays you would see no limits to his
attainments!'</p>

<p>"I thought Ilse was unfair, and I lifted my head haughtily.</p>

<p>"'After all,' I said, 'there <i>is</i> a difference between New
Moon and Stovepipe Town."</p>

<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

<h2><a name="c17" id="c17"><i>If a Body Kiss a Body</i></a>
</h2>

<p>It was half-past ten o'clock and Emily realized with a sigh that
she must go to bed. When she had come in at half-past nine from
Alice Kennedy's thimble party, she had asked permission of Aunt
Ruth to sit up an hour later to do some special studying. Aunt Ruth
had consented reluctantly and suspiciously and had gone to bed
herself, with sundry warnings regarding candles and matches. Emily
had studied diligently for forty-five minutes and written poetry
for fifteen. The poem burned for completion, but Emily resolutely
pushed her portfolio away.</p>

<p>At that moment she remembered that she had left her Jimmy-book
in her school-bag in the dining-room. This would never do. Aunt
Ruth would be down before her in the morning and would inevitably
examine the book-bag, find the Jimmy-book and read it. There were
things in that Jimmy-book it was well Aunt Ruth should not see. She
must slip down and bring it up.</p>

<p>Very quietly she opened her door and tiptoed downstairs, in
anguish at every creaking step. Aunt Ruth, who slept in the big
front bedroom at the other end of the hall, would surely hear those
creaks. They were enough to waken the dead. They did not waken Aunt
Ruth, however, and Emily reached the dining-room, found her
book-bag, and was just going to return when she happened to glance
at the mantelpiece. There, propped up against the clock, was a
letter for her which had evidently come by the evening mail&mdash;a
nice thin letter with the address of a magazine in the corner.
Emily set her candle on the table, tore open the letter, found the
acceptance of a poem and a cheque for three dollars.
Acceptances&mdash;especially acceptances with cheque&mdash;were
still such rare occurrences with our Emily that they always made
her a little crazy. She forgot Aunt Ruth&mdash;she forgot that it
was nearing eleven o'clock: she stood there entranced, reading over
and over the brief editorial note&mdash;brief, but, oh, how sweet!
"Your charming poem"&mdash;"we would like to see more of your
work"&mdash;oh, yes, indeed, they <i>should</i> see more of it.</p>

<p>Emily turned with a start. Was that a tap at the door?
No&mdash;at the window. Who? What? The next moment she was aware
that Perry was standing on the side veranda, grinning at her
through the window.</p>

<p>She was at it in a flash and without pausing to think, still in
the exhilaration of her acceptance, she slipped the catch and
pushed the window up. She knew where Perry had been and was dying
to know how he had got along. He had been invited to dinner with
Dr. Hardy, in the fine Queen-street house. This was considered a
great honour and very few students ever received it. Perry owed the
invitation to his brilliant speech at the inter-school debate. Dr.
Hardy had heard it and decided that here was a coming man.</p>

<p>Perry had been enormously proud of the invitation and had
bragged of it to Teddy and Emily&mdash;not to Ilse, who had not yet
forgiven him for his tactlessness on the night of the debate. Emily
had been pleased, but had warned Perry that he would need to watch
his step at Dr. Hardy's. She felt some qualms in regard to his
etiquette, but Perry had felt none. <i>He</i> would be all right,
he loftily declared. Perry perched himself on the window-pill and
Emily sat down on the corner of the sofa, reminding herself that it
could be only for a minute.</p>

<p>"Saw the light in the window as I went past," said Perry. "So I
thought I'd just take a sneak round to the side and see if it was
you. Wanted to tell you the tale while it was fresh. Say, Emily,
you were right&mdash;r-i-g-h-t! I should smile. I wouldn't go
through this evening again for a hundred dollars."</p>

<p>"How <i>did</i> you get along?" asked Emily anxiously. In a
sense, she felt responsible for Perry's manners. Such as he had he
had acquired at New Moon.</p>

<p>Perry grinned.</p>

<p>"It's a heart-rending tale. I've had a lot of conceit taken out
of me. I suppose you'll say that's a good thing."</p>

<p>"You could spare some," said Emily coolly.</p>

<p>Perry shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll tell you all about it if you won't tell Ilse or
Teddy. I'm not going to have <i>them</i> laughing at me. I went to
Queen-street at the proper time&mdash;I remembered all you'd said
about boots and tie and nails and handkerchief and I was all right
outside. When I got to the house my troubles began. It was so big
and splendid I felt queer&mdash;not afraid&mdash;I wasn't afraid
<i>then</i>&mdash;but just a bit as if I was ready to
jump&mdash;like a strange cat when you try to pat it. I rang the
bell; of course, it stuck and kept on ringing like mad. I could
hear it away down the hall, and thinks I, 'They'll think I don't
know any better than to keep on ringing it till somebody comes,'
and that rattled me. The maid rattled me still more. I didn't know
whether I ought to shake hands with her or not."</p>

<p>"Oh, Perry!"</p>

<p>"Well, I <i>didn't.</i> I never was to a house where there was a
maid like that before, all dolled up with a cap and finicky little
apron. She made me feel like thirty cents."</p>

<p><i>"Did</i> you shake hands with her?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>Emily gave a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>"She held the door open and I went in. I didn't know what to do
then. Guess I'd have stood there till I took root, only Dr. Hardy
himself come&mdash;came&mdash;through the hall. <i>He</i> shook
hands and showed me where to put my hat and coat and then he took
me into the parlour to meet his wife. The floor was as slippery as
ice&mdash;and just as I stepped on the rug inside the parlour door
it went clean from under me and down I went and slid across the
floor, feet foremost, right to Mrs. Hardy. I was on my back, not on
my stomach, or it would have been quite the proper Oriental caper,
wouldn't it?"</p>

<p>Emily couldn't laugh.</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>Perry!"</i></p>

<p>"Great snakes, Emily, it wasn't my fault. All the etiquette in
the world couldn't have prevented it. Of course, I felt like a
fool, but I got up and laughed. Nobody else laughed. They were all
decent. Mrs. Hardy was smooth as wax&mdash;hoped I hadn't hurt
myself, and Dr. Hardy said <i>he</i> had slipped the same way more
than once after they had given up their good old carpets and taken
to rugs and hardwood. I was scared to move, so I sat down in the
nearest chair, and there was a dog on it&mdash;Mrs. Hardy's Peke.
Oh, I didn't kill it&mdash;<i>I</i> got the worst scare of the two.
By the time I had made port in another chair the
<i>sw</i>&mdash;perspiration was just pouring down my face. Some
more folks arrived just then, so that kind of took the edge off me,
and I had time to get my bearings. I found I had about ten pairs of
hands and feet. And my boots were too big and coarse. Then I found
myself with my hands in my pockets, <i>whistling."</i></p>

<p>Emily began to say, "Oh, Perry," but bit it off and swallowed
it. What was the use of saying <i>anything?</i></p>

<p>"I knew <i>that</i> wasn't proper, so I stopped and took my
hands out&mdash;and began to bite my nails. Finally, I put my hands
underneath me and sat on 'em. I doubled my feet back under my
chair, and I sat like that till we went out to dinner&mdash;sat
like that when a fat old lady waddled in and all the other fellows
stood up. I didn't&mdash;didn't see any reason for it&mdash;there
was plenty of chairs. But later on it occurred to me that it was
some etiquette stunt and I ought to have got up, too. Should
I?"</p>

<p>"Of course," said Emily, wearily. "Don't you remember how Ilse
used to rag you about that very thing?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'd forgotten&mdash;Ilse was always jawing about something.
But live and learn. I won't forget again, you bet. There were three
or four other boys there&mdash;the new French teacher and a couple
of bankers&mdash;and some ladies. I got out to dinner without
falling over the floor and got into a chair between Miss Hardy and
the aforesaid old lady. I gave one look over that table&mdash;and
then, Emily, I knew what it was to be afraid at last, all right. I
never knew it before, honest. It's an awful feeling. I was in a
regular funk. I used to think you carried fierce style at New Moon
when you had company, but I never saw anything like that
table&mdash;and everything so dazzling and glittering, and enough
forks and spoons and things at one place to fit everybody out.
There was a piece of bread folded in my napkin and it fell out and
went skating over the floor. I could feel myself turning red all
over my face and neck. I s'pose you call it blushing. I never
blushed afore&mdash;before&mdash;that I remember. I didn't know
whether I ought to get up and go and pick it up or not. Then the
maid brought me another one. I used the wrong spoon to eat my soup
with, but I tried to remember what your Aunt Laura said about the
proper way to eat soup. I'd get on all right for a few
spoonfuls&mdash;then I'd get interested in something somebody was
saying&mdash;and go <i>gulp."</i></p>

<p>"Did you tilt your plate to get the last spoonful?" asked Emily
despairingly.</p>

<p>"No, I was just going to when I remembered it wasn't proper. I
hated to lose it, too. It was awful good soup and I was hungry. The
good old dowager next to me <i>did.</i> I got on pretty well with
the meat and vegetables, except once. I had packed a load of meat
and potatoes on my fork and just as I lifted it I saw Mrs. Hardy
eyeing it, and I remembered I oughtn't to have loaded up my fork
like that&mdash;and I jumped&mdash;and it all fell off in my
napkin. I didn't know whether it would be etiquette to scrape it up
and put it back on my plate so I left it there. The pudding was all
right&mdash;only I et it with a spoon&mdash;my soup spoon&mdash;and
every one else et theirs with a fork. But it tasted just as good
one way as another and I was getting reckless. You always use
spoons at New Moon to eat pudding."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you watch what the others did and imitate them?"</p>

<p>"Too rattled. But I'll say this&mdash;for all the style, the
eats weren't a bit better than you have at New Moon&mdash;no, nor
as good, by a jugful. Your Aunt Elizabeth's cooking would knock the
spots off the Hardys' every time&mdash;and they didn't give you too
much of anything! After the dinner was over we went back to the
parlour&mdash;<i>they</i> called it living-room&mdash;and things
weren't so bad. I didn't do anything out of the way except knock
over a bookcase."</p>

<p>"Perry!"</p>

<p>"Well, it was wobbly. I was leaning against it talking to Mr.
Hardy, and I suppose I leaned too hard, for the blooming thing went
over. But, righting it and getting the books back seemed to loosen
me up and I wasn't so tongue-tied after that. I got on not too
bad&mdash;only every once in a long while I'd let slip a bit of
slang, before I could catch it. I tell you, I wished I'd taken your
advice about talking slang. Once the fat old lady agreed with
something I'd said&mdash;she had sense if she <i>did</i> have three
chins&mdash;and I was so tickled to find her on my side that I got
excited and said to her, 'You bet your boots' before I thought. And
I guess I bragged a bit. <i>Do</i> I brag too much, Emily?"</p>

<p>This question had never presented itself to Perry before.</p>

<p>"You <i>do,"</i> said Emily candidly, "and it's <i>very</i> bad
form."</p>

<p>"Well, I felt kind of cheap after I'd done it. I guess I've got
an awful lot to learn yet, Emily. I'm going to buy a book on
etiquette and learn it off by heart. No more evenings like this for
me. But it was better at the last. Jim Hardy took me off to the den
and we played checkers and I licked him dizzy. Nothing wrong with
my checker etiquette, I tell <i>you.</i> And Mrs. Hardy said my
speech at the debate was the best she had ever heard for a boy of
my age, and she wanted to know what I meant to go in for. She's a
great little dame and has the social end of things down fine. That
is one reason I want you to marry me when the times comes,
Emily&mdash;I've got to have a wife with brains."</p>

<p>"Don't talk nonsense, Perry," said Emily, haughtily.</p>

<p>"'Tisn't nonsense," said Perry, stubbornly. "And it's time we
settled <i>something.</i> You needn't turn up your nose at me
because you're a Murray. I'll be worth marrying some day&mdash;even
for a Murray. Come, put me out of my misery."</p>

<p>Emily rose disdainfully. She had her dreams, as all girls have,
the rose-red one of love among them, but Perry Miller had no share
in those dreams.</p>

<p>"I'm <i>not</i> a Murray&mdash;and I'm going upstairs. Good
night."</p>

<p>"Wait half a second," said Perry, with a grin. "When the clock
strikes eleven I'm going to kiss you."</p>

<p>Emily did not for a moment believe that Perry had the slightest
notion of doing anything of the kind&mdash;which was foolish of
her, for Perry had a habit of always doing what he said he was
going to do. But, then, he had never been sentimental. She ignored
his remark, but lingered a moment to ask another question about the
Hardy dinner. Perry did not answer the question: the clock began to
strike eleven as she asked it&mdash;he flung his legs over the
window-sill and stepped into the room. Emily realized too late that
he meant what he said. She had only time to duck her head and
Perry's hearty, energetic smack&mdash;there was nothing subtle
about Perry's kisses&mdash;fell on her ear instead of her
cheek.</p>

<p>At the very moment Perry kissed her and before her indignant
protest could rush to her lips two things happened. A gust of wind
swept in from the veranda and blew the little candle out,
<i>and</i> the dining-room door opened and Aunt Ruth appeared in
the doorway, robed in a pink flannel nightgown and carrying another
candle, the light of which struck upward with gruesome effect on
her set face with its halo of crimping-pins.</p>

<p>This is one of the places where a conscientious biographer feels
that, in the good old phrase, her pen cannot do justice to the
scene.</p>

<p>Emily and Perry stood as if turned to stone. So, for a moment,
did Aunt Ruth. Aunt Ruth had expected to find Emily there, writing,
as she had done one night a month previously when Emily had had an
inspiration at bedtime and had slipped down to the warm dining-room
to jot it down in a Jimmy-book. But <i>this!</i> I must admit it
<i>did</i> look bad. Really, I think we can hardly blame Aunt Ruth
for righteous indignation.</p>

<p>Aunt Ruth looked at the unlucky pair.</p>

<p>"What are you doing here?" she asked Perry.</p>

<p>Stovepipe Town made a mistake.</p>

<p>"Oh, looking for a round square," said Perry offhandedly, his
eyes suddenly becoming limpid with mischief and lawless
roguery.</p>

<p>Perry's "impudence"&mdash;Aunt Ruth called it that, and, really,
I think he <i>was</i> impudent&mdash;naturally made a bad matter
worse. Aunt Ruth turned to Emily.</p>

<p>"Perhaps <i>you</i> can explain how you came to be here, at this
hour, kissing this fellow in the dark?"</p>

<p>Emily flinched from the crude vulgarity of the question as if
Aunt Ruth had struck her. She forgot how much appearances justified
Aunt Ruth, and let a perverse spirit enter into and possess her.
She lifted her head haughtily.</p>

<p>"I have no explanation to give to such a question, Aunt
Ruth."</p>

<p>"I didn't think you would have."</p>

<p>Aunt Ruth gave a very disagreeable laugh, through which a thin,
discordant note of triumph sounded. One might have thought that,
under all her anger, something pleased Aunt Ruth. It <i>is</i>
pleasant to be justified in the opinion we have always entertained
of anybody. "Well, perhaps you will be so good as to answer some
questions. How did this fellow get here?"</p>

<p>"Window," said Perry laconically, seeing that Emily was not
going to answer.</p>

<p>"I was not asking <i>you,</i> sir. Go," said Aunt Ruth, pointing
dramatically to the window.</p>

<p>"I'm not going to stir a step out of this room until I see what
you're going to do to Emily," said Perry stubbornly.</p>

<p>"<i>I</i>," said Aunt Ruth, with an air of terrible detachment,
"am not going to do anything to Emily."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Dutton, be a good sport," implored Perry coaxingly. "It's
all my fault&mdash;honest! Emily wasn't one bit to blame. You see,
it was this way&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Perry was too late.</p>

<p>"I have asked my niece for an explanation and she has refused to
give it. I do not choose to listen to yours."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;" persisted Perry.</p>

<p>"You had better go, Perry," said Emily, whose face was flying
danger signals. She spoke quietly, but the Murrayest of all Murrays
could not have expressed a more definite command. There was a
quality in it Perry dared not disregard. He meekly scrambled out of
the window into the night. Aunt Ruth stepped forward and shut the
window. Then, ignoring Emily utterly, she marched her pink
flanneled little figure back upstairs.</p>

<p>Emily did not sleep much that night&mdash;nor, I admit, did she
deserve to. After her sudden anger died away, shame cut her like a
whip. She realized that she had behaved very foolishly in refusing
an explanation to Aunt Ruth. Aunt Ruth had a right to it, when such
a situation developed in her own house, no matter how hateful and
disagreeable she made her method of demanding it. Of course, she
would not have believed a word of it; but Emily, if she had given
it, would not have further complicated her false position.</p>

<p>Emily fully expected she would be sent home to New Moon in
disgrace. Aunt Ruth would stonily decline to keep such a girl any
longer in her house&mdash;Aunt Elizabeth would agree with
her&mdash;Aunt Laura would be heart-broken. Would even Cousin
Jimmy's loyalty stand the strain? It was a very bitter prospect. No
wonder Emily spent a white night. She was so unhappy that every
beat of her heart seemed to hurt her. And again I say, most
unequivocally, she deserved it. I haven't one word of pity or
excuse for her.</p>

<h2><a name="c18" id="c18"><i>Circumstantial Evidence</i></a>
</h2>

<p>At the Saturday morning breakfast-table Aunt Ruth preserved a
stony silence, but she smiled cruelly to herself as she buttered
and ate her toast. Anyone might have seen clearly that Aunt Ruth
was enjoying herself&mdash;and, with equal clearness, that Emily
was <i>not.</i> Aunt Ruth passed Emily the toast and marmalade with
killing politeness, as if to say,</p>

<p>"I will not abate one jot or tittle of the proper thing. I may
turn you out of my house, but it will be your own fault if you go
without your breakfast."</p>

<p>After breakfast Aunt Ruth went uptown. Emily suspected that she
had gone to telephone to Dr. Burnley a message for New Moon. She
expected when Aunt Ruth returned to be told to pack her trunk. But
still Aunt Ruth spoke not. In the middle of the afternoon Cousin
Jimmy arrived with the double-seated box-sleigh. Aunt Ruth went out
and conferred with him. Then she came in and at last broke her
silence.</p>

<p>"Put on your wraps," she said. "We are going to New Moon."</p>

<p>Emily obeyed mutely. She got into the back seat of the sleigh
and Aunt Ruth sat beside Cousin Jimmy in front. Cousin Jimmy looked
back at Emily over the collar of his fur coat and said, "Hello,
Pussy," with just a shade too much of cheerful encouragement.
Evidently Cousin Jimmy believed something very serious had
happened, though he didn't know what.</p>

<p>It was not a pleasant drive through the beautiful greys and
smokes and pearls of the winter afternoon. The arrival at New Moon
was not pleasant. Aunt Elizabeth looked stern&mdash;Aunt Laura
looked apprehensive.</p>

<p>"I have brought Emily here," said Aunt Ruth, "because I do not
feel that I can deal with her alone. You and Laura, Elizabeth, must
pass judgment on her behaviour yourselves."</p>

<p>So it was to be a domestic court, with her, Emily, at the bar of
justice. Justice&mdash;would she get justice? Well, she would make
a fight for it. She flung up her head and the colour rushed back
into her face.</p>

<p>They were all in the sitting-room when she came down from her
room. Aunt Elizabeth sat by the table. Aunt Laura was on the sofa
ready to cry. Aunt Ruth was standing on the rug before the fire,
looking peevishly at Cousin Jimmy, who, instead of going to the
barn as he should have done, had tied the horse to the orchard
fence and had seated himself back in the corner, determined, like
Perry, to see what was going to be done to Emily. Ruth was annoyed.
She wished Elizabeth would not always insist on admitting Jimmy to
family conclaves when he desired to be present. It was absurd to
suppose that a grown-up child like Jimmy had any right there.</p>

<p>Emily did not sit down. She went and stood by the window, where
her black head came out against the crimson curtain as softly and
darkly clear as a pine-tree against a sunset of spring. Outside a
white, dead world lay in the chilly twilight of early March. Past
the garden and the Lombardy poplars the fields of New Moon looked
very lonely and drear, with the intense red streak of lingering
sunset beyond them. Emily shivered.</p>

<p>"Well," said Cousin Jimmy, "let's begin and get it over. Emily
must want her supper."</p>

<p>"When you know what <i>I</i> know about her, you will think she
needs something besides supper," said Mrs. Dutton tartly.</p>

<p>"I know all anyone need know about Emily," retorted Cousin
Jimmy.</p>

<p>"Jimmy Murray, you are an ass," said Aunt Ruth, angrily.</p>

<p>"Well, we're cousins," agreed Cousin Jimmy pleasantly.</p>

<p>"Jimmy, be silent," said Elizabeth, majestically. "Ruth, let us
hear what you have to say."</p>

<p>Aunt Ruth told the whole story. She stuck to facts, but her
manner of telling them made them seem even blacker than they were.
She really contrived to make a very ugly story of it, and Emily
shivered again as she listened. As the telling proceeded Aunt
Elizabeth's face became harder and colder, Aunt Laura began to cry,
and Cousin Jimmy began to whistle.</p>

<p>"He was kissing her <i>neck,"</i> concluded Aunt Ruth. Her tone
implied that, bad as it was to kiss on ordinary places for kissing,
it was a thousand-fold more scandalous and disgraceful to kiss the
neck.</p>

<p>"It was my ear, really," murmured Emily, with a sudden impish
grin she could not check in time. Under all her discomfort and
dread, there was <i>Something</i> that was standing back and
<i>enjoying</i> this&mdash;the drama, the comedy of it. But this
outbreak of it was most unfortunate. It made her appear flippant
and unashamed.</p>

<p>"Now, I ask you," said Aunt Ruth, throwing out her pudgy hands,
"if you can expect me to keep a girl like her any longer in my
house?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't think we can," said Elizabeth slowly.</p>

<p>Aunt Laura began to sob wildly. Cousin Jimmy brought down the
front legs of his chair with a bang.</p>

<p>Emily turned from the window and faced them all.</p>

<p>"I want to explain what happened, Aunt Elizabeth."</p>

<p>"I think we have heard enough about it," said Aunt Elizabeth
icily&mdash;all the more icily because of a certain bitter
disappointment that was filling her soul. She had been gradually
becoming very fond and proud of Emily, in her reserved,
undemonstrative Murray way: to find her capable of such conduct as
this was a terrible blow to Aunt Elizabeth. Her very pain made her
the more merciless.</p>

<p>"No, that won't do now, Aunt Elizabeth," said Emily quietly.
"I'm too old to be treated like that. You <i>must</i> hear my side
of the story."</p>

<p>The Murray look was on her face&mdash;the look Elizabeth knew
and remembered so well of old. She wavered.</p>

<p>"You had your chance to explain last night," snapped Aunt Ruth,
"and you wouldn't do it."</p>

<p>"Because I was hurt and angry over your thinking the worst of
me," said Emily. "Besides, I knew <i>you</i> wouldn't believe
me."</p>

<p>"I would have believed you if you had told the truth," said Aunt
Ruth. "The reason you wouldn't explain last night was because you
couldn't think up an excuse for your conduct on the spur of the
moment. You've had time to invent something since, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Did you ever know Emily to tell a lie?" demanded Cousin
Jimmy.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dutton opened her lips to say "Yes." Then closed them
again. Suppose Jimmy should demand a specific instance? She felt
sure Emily had told her&mdash;fibs&mdash;a score of times, but what
proof had she of it?</p>

<p><i>"Did</i> you?" persisted that abominable Jimmy.</p>

<p>"I am not going to be catechized by you." Aunt Ruth turned her
back on him. "Elizabeth, I've always told you that girl was deep
and sly, haven't I?"</p>

<p>"Yes," admitted poor Elizabeth, rather thankful that there need
be no indecision on <i>that</i> point. Ruth had certainly told her
so times out of number.</p>

<p>"And doesn't this show I was right?"</p>

<p>"I'm&mdash;afraid&mdash;so." Elizabeth Murray felt that it was a
very bitter moment for her.</p>

<p>"Then it is for <i>you</i> to decide what is to be done about
the matter," said Ruth triumphantly.</p>

<p>"Not yet," interposed Cousin Jimmy resolutely. "You haven't
given Emily the ghost of a chance to explain. That's no fair trial.
Now let her talk for ten minutes without interrupting her
once."</p>

<p>"That is only fair," said Elizabeth with sudden resolution. She
had a mad, irrational hope that, after all, Emily might be able to
clear herself.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;well&mdash;" Mrs. Dutton yielded ungraciously and sat
herself down with a thud on old Archibald Murray's chair.</p>

<p>"Now, Emily, tell us what really happened," said Cousin
Jimmy.</p>

<p>"Well, upon my word!" exploded Aunt Ruth. "Do you mean to say
<i>I</i> didn't tell what really happened?"</p>

<p>Cousin Jimmy lifted his hand.</p>

<p>"Now&mdash;now&mdash;you had your say. Come, Pussy."</p>

<p>Emily told her story from beginning to end. Something in it
carried conviction. Three of her listeners at least believed her
and felt an enormous load lifted from their minds. Even Aunt Ruth,
deep down in her heart, knew Emily was telling the truth, but she
would not admit it.</p>

<p>"A very ingenious tale, upon my word." she said derisively.</p>

<p>Cousin Jimmy got up and walked across the floor. He bent down
before Mrs. Dutton and thrust his rosy face with its forked beard
and child-like brown eyes under his shock of grey curls, very close
to hers.</p>

<p>"Ruth Murray," he said, "do you remember the story that got
around forty years ago about you and Fred Blair? <i>Do</i>
you?"</p>

<p>Aunt Ruth pushed back her chair. Cousin Jimmy followed her.</p>

<p>"Do you remember that you were caught in a scrape that looked
far worse than this? <i>Didn't</i> it?"</p>

<p>Again poor Aunt Ruth pushed back her chair. Again Cousin Jimmy
followed.</p>

<p>"Do you remember how mad you were because people wouldn't
believe you? But your father believed you&mdash;<i>he</i> had
confidence in his own flesh and blood. <i>Hadn't</i> he?"</p>

<p>Aunt Ruth had reached the wall by this time and had to surrender
at discretion.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;remember well enough," she said shortly.</p>

<p>Her cheeks were a curdled red. Emily looked at her interestedly.
<i>Was</i> Aunt Ruth trying to blush? Ruth Dutton was, in fact,
living over some very miserable months in her long past youth. When
she was a girl of eighteen she had been trapped in a very ugly
situation. And she had been innocent&mdash;absolutely innocent. She
had been the helpless victim of a most impish combination of
circumstances. Her father had believed her story and her own family
had backed her up. But her contemporaries had believed the evidence
of known facts for years&mdash;perhaps believed it yet, if they
ever thought about the matter. Ruth Dutton shivered over the
remembrance of her suffering under the lash of scandal. She no
longer dared to refuse credence to Emily's story but she could not
yield gracefully.</p>

<p>"Jimmy," she said sharply, "will you be good enough to go away
and sit down? I suppose Emily <i>is</i> telling the
truth&mdash;it's a pity she took so long deciding to tell it. And
I'm sure that creature <i>was</i> making love to her."</p>

<p>"No, he was only asking me to marry him," said Emily coolly.</p>

<p>You heard three gasps in the room. Aunt Ruth alone was able to
speak.</p>

<p>"Do you intend to, may I ask?"</p>

<p>"No. I've told him so half a dozen times."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm glad you had that much sense. Stovepipe Town,
indeed!"</p>

<p>"Stovepipe Town had nothing to do with it. Ten years from now
Perry Miller will be a man whom even a Murray would delight to
honour. But he doesn't happen to be the type I fancy, that's
all."</p>

<p>Could <i>this</i> be Emily&mdash;this tall young woman coolly
giving her reasons for refusing an offer of marriage&mdash;and
talking about the "types" she fancied?
Elizabeth&mdash;Laura&mdash;even Ruth looked at her as if they had
never seen her before. And there was a new respect in their eyes.
Of course they knew that Andrew was&mdash;was&mdash;well, in short,
that Andrew <i>was.</i> But years must doubtless pass before Andrew
would&mdash;would&mdash;well, <i>would!</i> And now the thing had
happened already with another suitor&mdash;happened "half a dozen
times" mark you! At that moment, although they were quite
unconscious of it, they ceased to regard her as a child. At a bound
she had entered their world and must henceforth be met on equal
terms. There could be no more family courts. They <i>felt</i> this,
though they did not perceive it. Aunt Ruth's next remark showed it.
She spoke almost as she might have spoken to Laura or Elizabeth, if
she had deemed it her duty to admonish them.</p>

<p>"Just suppose, Emily, if anyone passing had seen Perry Miller
sitting in that window at that hour of night?"</p>

<p>"Yes, of course. I see your angle of it perfectly, Aunt Ruth.
All I want is to get you to see <i>mine.</i> I was foolish to open
the window and talk to Perry&mdash;I see that now. I simply didn't
think&mdash;and then I got so interested in the story of his
mishaps at Dr. Hardy's dinner that I forgot how time was
going."</p>

<p>"Was Perry Miller to dinner at <i>Dr. Hardy's?"</i> asked Aunt
Elizabeth. This was another staggerer for her. The world&mdash;the
Murray world&mdash;must be literally turned upside-down if
Stovepipe Town was invited to dinner on Queen Street. At the same
moment Aunt Ruth remembered with a pang of horror that Perry Miller
had seen her in her pink flannel nightgown. It hadn't mattered
before&mdash;he had been only the help-boy at New Moon. <i>Now</i>
he was Dr. Hardy's guest.</p>

<p>"Yes. Dr. Hardy thinks he is a very brilliant debater and says
he has a future," said Emily.</p>

<p>"Well," snapped Aunt Ruth, "<i>I</i> wish you would stop
prowling about my house at all hours, writing novels. If you had
been in your bed, as you should have been, this would never have
happened."</p>

<p>"I wasn't writing novels," cried Emily. "I've never written a
word of fiction since I promised Aunt Elizabeth. I wasn't writing
<i>anything.</i> I told you I just went down to get my
Jimmy-book."</p>

<p><i>"Why</i> couldn't you have left that where it was till
morning?" persisted Aunt Ruth.</p>

<p>"Come, come," said Cousin Jimmy, "don't start up another
argument. I want my supper. You girls go and get it."</p>

<p>Elizabeth and Laura left the room as meekly as if old Archibald
Murray himself had commanded it. After a moment Ruth followed them.
Things had not turned out just as she anticipated; but, after all,
she was resigned. It would not have been a nice thing for a scandal
like this concerning a Murray to be blown abroad, as must have
happened if a verdict of guilty had been found against Emily.</p>

<p>"So <i>that's</i> settled," said Cousin Jimmy to Emily as the
door closed.</p>

<p>Emily drew a long breath. The quiet, dignified old room suddenly
seemed very beautiful and friendly to her.</p>

<p>"Yes, thanks to you," she said, springing across it to give him
an impetuous hug. "Now, scold me, Cousin Jimmy, scold me
<i>hard."</i></p>

<p>"No, no. But it <i>would</i> have been more prudent <i>not</i>
to have opened that window, wouldn't it now, Pussy?"</p>

<p>"Of course it would. But prudence is such a shoddy virtue at
times, Cousin Jimmy. One is ashamed of it&mdash;one likes to just
go ahead and&mdash;and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And hang consequences," supplied Cousin Jimmy.</p>

<p>"Something like that," Emily laughed. "I hate to go mincing
through life, afraid to take a single long step for fear somebody
is watching. I want to 'wave my wild tail and walk by my wild
lone.' There wasn't a bit of real harm in my opening that window
and talking to Perry. There wasn't even any harm in his trying to
kiss me. He just did it to tease me. Oh, I <i>hate</i> conventions.
As you say&mdash;hang consequences."</p>

<p>"But we can't hang 'em, Pussy&mdash;that's just the trouble.
They're more likely to hang us. I put it to you,
Pussy&mdash;suppose&mdash;there's no harm in supposing
it&mdash;that you were grown up and married and had a daughter of
your age, and you went downstairs one night and found her as Aunt
Ruth found you and Perry. <i>Would</i> you like it? <i>Would</i>
you be well pleased? Honest, now?"</p>

<p>Emily stared hard at the fire for a moment.</p>

<p>"No, I wouldn't," she said at last. "But then&mdash;that's
different. I wouldn't <i>know."</i></p>

<p>Cousin Jimmy chuckled.</p>

<p>"That's the point, Pussy. Other people can't <i>know.</i> So
we've got to watch our step. Oh, I'm only simple Jimmy Murray, but
I can see we have to watch our step. Pussy, we're going to have
roast spare-ribs for supper."</p>

<p>A savoury whiff crept in from the kitchen at that very
moment&mdash;a homely, comfortable odour that had nothing in common
with compromising situations and family skeletons. Emily gave
Cousin Jimmy another hug.</p>

<p>"Better a dinner of herbs where Cousin Jimmy is than roast
spare-ribs and Aunt Ruth therewith," she said.</p>

<h2><a name="c19" id="c19"><i>"Airy Voices"</i></a>
</h2>

<p>"April 3, 19&mdash;</p>

<p>"There <i>are</i> times when I am tempted to believe in the
influence of evil stars or the reality of unlucky days. Otherwise
how can such diabolical things happen as do happen to well-meaning
people? Aunt Ruth has only just begun to grow weary of recalling
the night she found Perry kissing me in the dining-room, and now
I'm in another ridiculous scrape.</p>

<p>"I will be honest. It was not dropping my umbrella which was
responsible for it, neither was it the fact that I let the kitchen
mirror at New Moon fall last Saturday and crack. It was just my own
carelessness.</p>

<p>"St. John's Presbyterian church here in Shrewsbury became vacant
at New Year's and has been hearing candidates. Mr. Towers of the
<i>Times</i> asked me to report the sermons for his paper on such
Sundays as I was not in Blair Water. The first sermon was good and
I reported it with pleasure. The second one was harmless, very
harmless, and I reported it without pain. But the third, which I
heard last Sunday, was ridiculous. I said so to Aunt Ruth on the
way home from church and Aunt Ruth said, 'Do you think <i>you</i>
are competent to criticize a sermon?'</p>

<p>"Well, yes, I do!</p>

<p>"That sermon was a most inconsistent thing. Mr. Wickham
contradicted himself half a dozen times. He mixed his
metaphors&mdash;he attributed something to St. Paul that belonged
to Shakespeare&mdash;he committed almost every conceivable literary
sin, including the unpardonable one of being deadly dull. However,
it was my business to report the sermon, so report it I did. Then I
had to do something to get it out of my system, so I wrote, for my
own satisfaction, an analysis of it. It was a crazy but delightful
deed. I showed up all the inconsistencies, the misquotations, the
weaknesses and the wobblings. I enjoyed writing it&mdash;I made it
as pointed and satirical and satanical as I could&mdash;oh, I admit
it was a very vitriolic document.</p>

<p>"Then I handed <i>it</i> into the <i>Times</i> by mistake!</p>

<p>"Mr. Towers passed it over to the typesetter without reading it.
He had a touching confidence in my work, which he will never have
again. It came out the next day.</p>

<p>"I woke to find myself infamous.</p>

<p>"I expected Mr. Towers would be furious; but he is only mildly
annoyed&mdash;and a little amused at the back of it. It isn't as if
Mr. Wickham had been a settled minister here, of course. Nobody
cared for him or his sermon and Mr. Towers is a Presbyterian, so
the St. John's people can't accuse him of wanting to insult
<i>them.</i> It is poor Emily B. on whom is laid the whole burden
of condemnation. It appears most of them think I did it 'to show
off.' Aunt Ruth is furious, Aunt Elizabeth outraged; Aunt Laura
grieved, Cousin Jimmy alarmed. It is such a shocking thing to
criticize a minister's sermon. It is a Murray tradition that
ministers' sermons&mdash;Presbyterian Ministers'
especially&mdash;are sacrosanct. My presumption and vanity will yet
be the ruin of me, so Aunt Elizabeth coldly informs me. The only
person who seems pleased is Mr. Carpenter. (Dean is away in New
York. I know <i>he</i> would like it, too.) Mr. Carpenter is
telling every one that my 'report' is the best thing of its kind he
ever read. But Mr. Carpenter is suspected of heresy, so his
commendation will not go far to rehabilitate me.</p>

<p>"I feel wretched over the affair. My mistakes worry me more than
my sins sometimes. And yet, an unholy something, 'way back in me,
is grinning over it all. Every word in that 'report' was true. And
more than true&mdash;appropriate. <i>I</i> didn't mix my
metaphors.</p>

<p>"Now, to live this down!</p>

<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

<p>"April 20, 19&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Awake thou north wind and come thou south. Blow upon my garden
that the spices thereof may flow out.'</p>

<p>"So chanted I as I went through the Land of Uprightness this
evening&mdash;only I put 'woods' in place of garden. For spring is
just around the corner and I have forgotten everything but
gladness.</p>

<p>"We had a grey, rainy dawn but sunshine came in the afternoon
and a bit of April frost to-night&mdash;just enough to make the
earth firm. It seemed to me a night when the ancient gods might be
met with in the lonely places. But I saw nothing except some sly
things back among the fir copses that <i>may</i> have been
companies of goblins, if they weren't merely shadows.</p>

<p>"(I wonder why <i>goblin</i> is such an enchanting word and
<i>gobbling</i> such an ugly one. And why is <i>shadowy</i>
suggestive of all beauty while umbrageous is so ugly?)</p>

<p>"But I heard all kinds of fairy sounds and each gave me an
exquisite vanishing joy as I went up the hill. There is always
something satisfying in climbing to the top of a hill. And that is
a hill-top I love. When I reached it I stood still and let the
loveliness of the evening flow through me like music. How the Wind
Woman was singing in the bits of birchland around me&mdash;how she
whistled in the serrated tops of the trees against the sky! One of
the thirteen new silver moons of the year was hanging over the
harbour. I stood there and thought of many, many beautiful
things&mdash;of wild, free brooks running through starlit April
fields&mdash;of rippled grey-satin seas&mdash;of the grace of an
elm against the moonlight&mdash;of roots stirring and thrilling in
the earth&mdash;owls laughing in darkness&mdash;a curl of foam on a
long sandy shore&mdash;a young moon setting over a dark
hill&mdash;the grey of gulf storms.</p>

<p>"I had only seventy-five cents in the world but Paradise isn't
bought with money.</p>

<p>"Then I sat down on an old boulder and tried to put those
moments of delicate happiness into a poem. I caught the shape of
them fairly well, I think&mdash;but not their soul. It escaped
me.</p>

<p>"It was quite dark when I came back and the whole character of
my Land of Uprightness seemed changed. It was eerie&mdash;almost
sinister. I would have run if I could have dared. The trees, my old
well-known friends, were strange and aloof. The sounds I heard were
not the cheery, companionable sounds of daytime&mdash;nor the
friendly, fairy sounds of the sunset&mdash;they were creeping and
weird, as if the life of the woods had suddenly developed something
almost hostile to me&mdash;something at least that was furtive and
alien and unacquainted. I could fancy that I heard stealthy
footsteps all around me&mdash;that strange eyes were watching me
through the boughs. When I reached the open space and hopped over
the fence into Aunt Ruth's back yard I felt as if I were escaping
from some fascinating but not altogether hallowed locality&mdash;a
place given over to Paganism and the revels of satyrs. I don't
believe the woods are ever wholly Christian in the darkness. There
is always a lurking life in them that dares not show itself to the
sun but regains its own with the night.</p>

<p>"'You should not be out in the damp with that cough of yours,'
said Aunt Ruth.</p>

<p>"But it wasn't the damp that hurt me&mdash;for I <i>was</i>
hurt. It was that little fascinating whisper of something unholy. I
was afraid of it&mdash;and yet I loved it. The beauty I had loved
on the hill-top seemed suddenly quite tasteless beside it. I sat
down in my room and wrote another poem. When I had written it I
felt that I had exorcised something out of my soul and
Emily-in-the-Glass seemed no longer a stranger to me.</p>

<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

<p>"Aunt Ruth has just brought in a dose of hot milk and cayenne
pepper for my cough. It is on the table before me&mdash;I have to
drink it&mdash;and it has made both Paradise and Pagan-land seem
very foolish and unreal!</p>

<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

<p>"May 25, 19&mdash;</p>

<p>"Dean came home from New York last Friday and that evening we
walked and talked in New Moon garden in a weird, uncanny twilight
following a rainy day. I had a light dress on and as Dean came down
the path he said,</p>

<p>"'When I saw you first I thought you were a wild, white
cherry-tree&mdash;like <i>that'</i>&mdash;and he pointed to one
that was leaning and beckoning, ghost-fair in the dusk, from Lofty
John's bush.</p>

<p>"It was such a beautiful thing that just to be distantly
compared to it made me feel very well pleased with myself, and it
was lovely to have dear old Dean back again. So we had a delightful
evening, and picked a big bunch of Cousin Jimmy's pansies and
watched the grey rain-clouds draw together in great purple masses
in the east, leaving the western sky all clear and
star-powdered.</p>

<p>"'There is something in your company,' said Dean, 'that makes
stars seem starrier and pansies purpler.'</p>

<p>"Wasn't that nice of him! How is it that his opinion of me and
Aunt Ruth's opinion of me are so very different?</p>

<p>"He had a little flat parcel under his arm and when he went away
he handed it to me.</p>

<p>"'I brought you that to counteract Lord Byron,' he said.</p>

<p>"It was a framed copy of the 'Portrait of Giovanna Degli
Albizzi, wife of Lorenzo Tornabuoni Ghirlanjo'&mdash;a Lady of the
Quatro Cento. I brought it to Shrewsbury and have it hanging in my
room. I love to look at the Lady Giovanna&mdash;that slim,
beautiful young thing with her sleek coils of pale gold and her
prim little curls and her fine, high-bred profile <i>(did</i> the
painter flatter her?) and her white neck and open, unshadowed brow,
with the indefinable air over it all of saintliness and remoteness
and fate&mdash;for the Lady Giovanna died young.</p>

<p><i>"And</i> her embroidered velvet sleeves, slashed and puffed,
very beautifully made and fitting the arm perfectly. The Lady
Giovanna must have had a good dressmaker and, in spite of her
saintliness, one thinks she was quite aware of the fact. I am
always wishing that she would turn her head and let me see her full
face.</p>

<p>"Aunt Ruth thinks she is queer-looking and evidently doubts the
propriety of having her in the same room with the jewelled chromo
of Queen Alexandra.</p>

<p>"I doubt it myself.</p>

<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

<p>"June 10, 19&mdash;</p>

<p>"I do all my studying now by the pool in the Land of
Uprightness, among those wonderful, tall, slender trees. I'm a
Druidess in the woods&mdash;I regard trees with something more than
love&mdash;worship.</p>

<p>"And then, too, trees, unlike so many humans, always improve on
acquaintance. No matter how much you like them at the start you are
sure to like them much better further on, and best of all when you
have known them for years and enjoyed intercourse with them in all
seasons. I know a hundred dear things about these trees in the Land
of Uprightness that I didn't know when I came here two years
ago.</p>

<p>"Trees have as much individuality as human beings. Not even two
spruces are alike. There is always some kink or curve or bend of
bough to single each one out from its fellows. Some trees love to
grow sociably together, their branches twining, like Ilse and me
with our arms about each other, whispering interminably of their
secrets. Then there are more exclusive groups of four or
five&mdash;clan-Murray trees; and there are hermits of trees who
choose to stand apart in solitary state and who hold commune only
with the winds of heaven. Yet these trees are often the best worth
knowing. One feels it is more of a triumph to win their confidence
than that of easier trees. To-night I suddenly saw a great,
pulsating star resting on the very crest of the big fir that stands
alone in the eastern corner and I had a sense of two majesties
meeting that will abide with me for days and enchant
everything&mdash;even classroom routine and dish-washing and Aunt
Ruth's Saturday cleaning.</p>

<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

<p>"June 25, 19&mdash;</p>

<p>"We had our history examination to-day&mdash;the Tudor period.
I've found it very fascinating&mdash;but more because of what isn't
in the histories than of what <i>is.</i> They don't&mdash;they
<i>can't</i> tell you what you would really like to know. What did
Jane Seymour think of when she was awake in the dark? Of murdered
Anne, or of pale, forsaken Katherine? Or just about the fashion of
her new ruff? Did she ever think she had paid too high for her
crown or was she satisfied with her bargain? And was she happy in
those few hours after her little son was born&mdash;or did she see
a ghostly procession beckoning her onward with them? Was Lady Jane
Gray 'Janie' to her friends and did she <i>ever</i> have a fit of
temper? What did Shakespeare's wife actually think of him? And was
any man ever <i>really</i> in love with Queen Elizabeth? I am
always asking questions like this when I study that pageant of
kings and queens and geniuses and puppets put down in the school
curriculum as 'The Tudor Period.'</p>

<p>"Two years of High School are over. The result of my exams was
such as to please even Aunt Ruth, who condescended to say that she
always knew I could study if I put my mind to it. In brief, I led
my class. And I'm pleased. But I begin to understand what Dean
meant when he said real education was what you dug out of life for
yourself. After all, the things that have taught me the most these
past two years have been my wanderings in the Land of Uprightness,
and my night on the haystack, and the Lady Giovanna, and the old
woman who spanked the King, and trying to write nothing but
<i>facts,</i> and things like that. Even rejection slips and hating
Evelyn Blake have taught me something. Speaking of Evelyn&mdash;she
failed in her exams and will have to take her senior year over
again. I am truly sorry.</p>

particular about seeing that we have our bathing suits with us. I
wonder if she ever heard any faint, far-off echoes of our moonlit
petticoatedness.</p>

<p>"But so far our dips have been in the afternoon. And afterwards
we have a glorious wallow on sun-warm, golden sands, with the gauzy
dunes behind us stretching to the harbour, and the lazy blue sea
before us, dotted over with sails that are silver in the magic of
the sunlight. Oh, life is good&mdash;good&mdash;good. In spite of
three rejection slips that came to-day. Those very editors will be
<i>asking</i> for my work some day! Meanwhile Aunt Laura is
teaching me how to make a certain rich and complicated kind of
chocolate cake after a recipe which a friend of hers in Virginia
sent her thirty years ago. Nobody in Blair Water has ever been able
to get it and Aunt Laura made me solemnly promise I would never
reveal it.</p>

<p>"Aug. 2, 19&mdash;</p>

<p>"I was down seeing Mr. Carpenter this evening. He has been laid
up with rheumatism and one can see he is getting old. He was very
cranky with the scholars last year and there was some protest
against keeping him on, but it was done. Most of the Blair Water
people have sense enough to realize that with all his crankiness
Mr. Carpenter is a teacher in a thousand.</p>

<p>"'One can't teach fools amiably,' he growled, when the trustees
told him there were complaints about his harshness.</p>

<p>"Perhaps it was his rheumatism that made Mr. Carpenter rather
crusty over the poems I took to him for criticism. When he read the
one I had composed that April night on a hill-top he tossed it back
to me&mdash;'pretty little gossamer thing,' he said.</p>

<p>"And I had really thought the poem expressed in some measure the
enchantment of that evening. How I must have failed!</p>

<p>"Then I gave him the poem I had written after I had come in that
night. He read it over twice, then he deliberately tore it into
strips.</p>

<p>"'Now&mdash;<i>why?'</i> I said, rather annoyed. 'There was
nothing wrong about that poem, Mr. Carpenter.'</p>

<p>"'Not about its body,' he said. 'Every line of it, taken by
itself, might be read in Sunday-school. But its
<i>soul</i>&mdash;what mood were you in when you wrote that in
heaven's name?'</p>

<p>"'The mood of the Golden Age,' I said.</p>

<p>"'No&mdash;of an age far before that. That poem was sheer
Paganism, girl, though I don't think you realize it. To be sure,
from the point of view of literature it's worth a thousand of your
pretty songs. All the same, that way danger lies. Better stick to
your own age. You're part of it and can possess it without its
possessing you. Emily, there was a streak of diabolism in that
poem. It's enough to make me believe that poets <i>are</i>
inspired&mdash;by some spirits outside themselves. Didn't you feel
<i>possessed</i> when you wrote it?'</p>

<p>"'Yes,' I said, remembering. I felt rather glad Mr. Carpenter
had torn the poem up. I could never have done it myself. I have
destroyed a great many of my poems that seemed trash on successive
readings, but this one never seemed so and it always brought back
the strange charm and terror of that walk. But Mr. Carpenter was
right&mdash;I feel it.</p>

<p>"He also berated me because I happened to mention I had been
reading Mrs. Hemans' poems. Aunt Laura has a cherished volume,
bound in faded blue and gold, with an inscription from an admirer.
In Aunt Laura's youth it was the thing to give your adored a volume
of poetry on her birthday. The things Mr. Carpenter said about Mrs.
Hemans were not fit to write in a young lady's diary. I suppose he
is right in the main&mdash;yet I <i>do</i> like some of her poems.
Just here and there comes a line or verse that haunts me for days,
delightfully.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"The march of the hosts as Alaric passed</p>
</blockquote>

<p>is one&mdash;though I can't give any <i>reason</i> for my liking
it&mdash;one never <i>can</i> give reasons for
enchantment&mdash;and another is,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"The sounds of the sea and the sounds of the night<br>
Were around Clotilde as she knelt to pray<br>
In a chapel where the mighty lay<br>
On the old Provencal shore.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>"That isn't great poetry&mdash;but there's a bit of magic in it
for all that&mdash;concentrated in the last line, I think. I never
read it without feeling that <i>I</i> am <i>Clotilde,</i> kneeling
there&mdash;'on the old Provencal shore'&mdash;with the banners of
forgotten wars waving over me.</p>

<p>"Mr. Carpenter sneered at my 'liking for slops' and told me to
go and read the Elsie books! But when I was coming away he paid me
the first personal compliment I ever had from him.</p>

<p>"'I like that blue dress you've got on. And you know how to wear
it. That's good. I can't bear to see a woman badly dressed. It
hurts me&mdash;and it must hurt God Almighty. I've no use for dowds
and I'm sure He hasn't. After all, if you know how to dress
yourself it won't matter if you do like Mrs. Hemans.'</p>

<p>"I met Old Kelly on the way home and he stopped and gave me a
bag of candy and sent his 'rispects to <i>him.'</i></p>

<p>"This is a wonderful year for columbines. The old orchard is
full of them&mdash;all in lovely white and purple and fairy blue
and dreamy pink colour. They are half wild and so have a charm no
real tamed garden flower ever has. And what a
name&mdash;<i>columbine</i> is poetry itself. How much lovelier the
common names of flowers are than the horrid Latiny names the
florists stick in their catalogues. Heartsease and Bride's Bouquet,
Prince's Feather, Snap-dragon, Flora's Paint Brush, Dusty Millers,
Bachelor's Buttons, Baby's Breath, Love-in-a-mist&mdash;oh, I love
them all.</p>

<p>"September 1, 19&mdash;</p>

<p>"Two things happened to-day. One was a letter from Great-aunt
Nancy to Aunt Elizabeth. Aunt Nancy has never taken any notice of
my existence since my visit to Priest Pond four years ago. But she
is still alive, ninety-four years old, and from all accounts quite
lively yet. She wrote some sarcastic things in her letter, about
both me and Aunt Elizabeth; but she wound up by offering to pay all
my expenses in Shrewsbury next year, including my board to Aunt
Ruth.</p>

<p>"I am very glad. In spite of Aunt Nancy's sarcasm I don't mind
feeling indebted to her. <i>She</i> has never nagged or patronized
me&mdash;or did anything for me because she felt it her 'duty.'
'Hang duty,' she said in her letter. 'I'm doing this because it
will vex some of the Priests, and because Wallace is putting on too
many airs about "helping to educate Emily." I dare say you feel
yourself that you've done virtuously. Tell Emily to go back to
Shrewsbury and learn all she can&mdash;but to hide it and show her
ankles.' Aunt Elizabeth was horrified at this and wouldn't show me
the letter. But Cousin Jimmy told me what was in it.</p>

<p>"The second thing was that Aunt Elizabeth informed me that,
since Aunt Nancy was paying my expenses, she, Aunt Elizabeth, felt
that she ought not to hold me any longer to my promise about
writing fiction. I was, she told me, free to do as I chose about
that matter.</p>

<p>"'Though I shall never approve of your writing fiction,' she
said, gravely. 'At least I hope you will not neglect your
studies.'</p>

<p>"Oh, no, dear Aunt Elizabeth, I won't neglect them. But I feel
like a released prisoner. My fingers tingle to grasp a pen&mdash;my
brain teems with plots. I've a score of fascinating dream
characters I want to write about. Oh, if there only were not such a
chasm between <i>seeing</i> a thing and getting it down on
paper!</p>

<p>"'Ever since you got that cheque for a story last winter
Elizabeth's been wondering if she oughtn't to let you write,'
Cousin Jimmy told me. 'But she couldn't bring herself to back down
till Aunt Nancy's letter gave her the excuse. Money makes the
Murray mare go, Emily. Want some more Yankee stamps?'</p>

<p>"Mrs. Kent has told Teddy he can go for another year. After that
he doesn't know what will happen. So we are all going back and I am
so happy that I want to write it in Italics.</p>

<p>"October 7, 19&mdash;</p>

<p>"There was great excitement to-day in class when Dr. Hardy made
a certain announcement. Kathleen Darcy's uncle, who is a Professor
of McGill, is visiting here, and he has taken it into his head to
offer a prize for the best poem, written by a pupil of Shrewsbury
High School&mdash;said prize being a complete set of Parkman. The
poems must be handed in by the first of November, and are to be
'not less than twenty lines, and no more than sixty.' Sounds as if
a tape-measure was the first requisite. I have been wildly hunting
through my Jimmy-books to-night and have decided to send in <i>Wild
Grapes.</i> It is my second best poem. <i>A Song of Sixpence</i> is
my best, but it has only fifteen lines and to add any more would
spoil it. I think I can improve <i>Wild Grapes</i> a bit. There are
two or three words in it I've always been dubious about. They don't
exactly express fully what I want to say, but I can't find any
others that do, either. I wish one could coin words, as I used to
do long ago when I wrote letters to Father and just invented a word
whenever I wanted one. But then, Father would have understood the
words if he had ever seen the letters&mdash;while I am afraid the
judges in the contest wouldn't.</p>

<p><i>"Wild Grapes</i> should certainly win the prize. This isn't
conceit or vanity or presumption. It's just <i>knowing.</i> If the
prize were for mathematics Kath Darcy should win it. If it were for
beauty Hazel Ellis would win it. If it were for all round
proficiency, Perry Miller&mdash;for elocution, Ilse&mdash;for
drawing, Teddy. But since it is for poetry, E. B. Starr is the
one!</p>

<p>"We are studying Tennyson and Keats in Senior Literature this
year. I like Tennyson but sometimes he enrages me. He is
beautiful&mdash;not <i>too</i> beautiful, as Keats is&mdash;the
Perfect Artist. But he never lets us forget the artist&mdash;we are
always conscious of it&mdash;he is never swept away by some
splendid mountain torrent of feeling. Not he&mdash;he flows on
serenely between well-ordered banks and carefully laid-out gardens.
And no matter how much one loves a garden one doesn't want to be
cooped up in it <i>all</i> the time&mdash;one likes an excursion
now and then into the wilderness. At least Emily Byrd Starr
does&mdash;to the sorrow of her relations.</p>

<p>"Keats <i>is</i> too full of beauty. When I read his poetry I
feel stifled in roses and long for a breath of frosty air or the
austerity of a chill mountain peak. But, oh, he has <i>some</i>
lines&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Magic casements opening on the foam<br>
Of perilous seas, in faerylands forlorn&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>"When I read them I always feel a sort of despair! <i>What</i>
is the use of trying to do what <i>has</i> been done, once and for
all?</p>

<p>"But I found some other lines that inspire me&mdash;I have
written them on the index-page of my new Jimmy-book.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"He ne'er is crowned<br>
With immortality who fears to follow<br>
Where airy voices lead.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>"Oh, it's true. We must follow our 'airy voices,' follow them
through every discouragement and doubt and disbelief till they lead
us to our City of Fulfilment, wherever it may be.</p>

<p>"I had four rejections in the mail to-day, raucously shrieking
failure at me. Airy Voices grow faint in such a clamour. But I'll
hear them again. And I <i>will</i> follow&mdash;I will not be
discouraged. Years ago I wrote a 'vow'&mdash;I found it the other
day in an old packet in my cupboard&mdash;that I would 'climb the
Alpine Path and write my name on the scroll of fame.'</p>

<p>"I'll keep on climbing!</p>

<p>"I read my <i>Chronicles of an Old Garden</i> over the other
night. I think I can improve it considerably, now that Aunt
Elizabeth has lifted the ban. I wanted Mr. Carpenter to read it,
but he said,</p>

<p>"'Lord, girl, I can't wade through all that stuff. My eyes are
bad. What is it&mdash;a book? Jade, it will be time ten years from
now for you to be writing books.'</p>

<p>"'I've got to practise,' I said indignantly.</p>

<p>"'Oh, practise&mdash;practise&mdash;but don't try out the
results on me. I'm too old&mdash;I really am, Jade. I don't mind a
short&mdash;a very short story&mdash;now and then&mdash;but let a
poor old devil off the books.'</p>

<p>"I might ask Dean what he thinks of it. But Dean <i>does</i>
laugh now at my ambitions&mdash;very cautiously and
kindly&mdash;but he <i>does</i> laugh. And Teddy thinks everything
I write perfect, so he's no use as a critic. I wonder&mdash;I
wonder if any publisher would accept <i>The Chronicles?</i> I'm
sure I've seen books of the kind that weren't <i>much</i>
better.</p>

<p>"This evening I spent "expurgating" a novel for Mr. Towers' use
and behoof. When Mr. Towers was away in August on his vacation the
sub-editor, Mr. Grady, began to run a serial in the <i>Times</i>
called <i>A Bleeding Heart.</i> Instead of getting A. P. A. stuff,
as Mr. Towers always does, Mr. Grady simply bought the reprint of a
sensational and sentimental English novel at the Shoppe and began
publishing it. It was very long and only about half of it has
appeared. Mr. Towers saw that it would run all winter in its
present form. So he bade me take it and cut out 'all unnecessary
stuff.' I have followed instruction mercilessly&mdash;'cutting out'
most of the kisses and embraces, two-thirds of the love-making and
all the descriptions, with the happy results that I have reduced it
to about a quarter of its normal length; and all I can say is may
heaven have mercy on the soul of the compositor who has to set it
in its present mutilated condition.</p>

<p>"Summer and autumn have gone. It seems to me they go more
quickly than they used to. The golden-rod has turned white in the
corners of the Land of Uprightness and the frost lies like a silver
scarf on the ground o' mornings. The evening winds that go 'piping
down the valleys wild' are heart-broken searchers, seeking for
things loved and lost, calling in vain on elf and fay. For the
fairy folk, if they be not all fled afar to the southlands, must be
curled up asleep in the hearts of the firs or among the roots of
the ferns.</p>

<p>"And every night we have murky red sunsets flaming in smoky
crimson across the harbour, with a star above them like a saved
soul gazing with compassionate eyes into pits of torment where
sinful spirits are being purged from the stains of earthly
pilgrimage.</p>

<p>"Would I dare to show the above sentence to Mr. Carpenter? I
would <i>not.</i> Therefore there is something fearfully wrong with
it.</p>

<p>"I know what's wrong with it, now that I've written it in cold
blood. It's 'fine writing.' And yet it's just what I felt when I
stood on the hill beyond the Land of Uprightness to-night and
looked across the harbour. And who cares what this old journal
thinks?</p>

<p>"Evelyn's prize poem was printed in the <i>Times</i> this week
with her photograph and a biographical sketch. The set of Parkman
is on exhibition in the windows of the Booke Shoppe.</p>

<p><i>"A Legend of Abegweit is</i> a fairly good poem. It is in
ballad style, and rhythm and rhyme are correct&mdash;which could
not be said of any other poem of Evelyn's I've ever seen.</p>

<p>"Evelyn Blake has said of everything of mine she ever saw in
print that she was sure I copied it from somewhere. I hate to
imitate her&mdash;but I <i>know</i> that <i>she</i> never wrote
that poem. It isn't any expression of <i>her</i> at all. She might
as well have imitated Dr. Hardy's handwriting and claimed it as her
own. Her mincing, copperplate script is as much like Dr. Hardy's
black, forcible scrawl as that poem is like <i>her.</i></p>

is <i>not</i> as good as <i>Wild Grapes.</i></p>

It was too noisy. I would have liked it years ago but they never
asked me then. I had to eat when I wasn't hungry&mdash;play
parchesi when I didn't want to&mdash;talk when I wanted to be
silent. I was never alone for one moment all the time I was there.
Besides, Andrew is getting to be such a nuisance. And Aunt Addie
was odiously kind and motherly. I just felt all the time like a cat
who is held on a lap where it doesn't want to be and gently, firmly
stroked. I had to sleep with Jen, who is my first cousin and just
my age, and who thinks in her heart I'm not half good enough for
Andrew but is going to try, with the blessing of God, to make the
best of it. Jen is a nice, sensible girl and she and I are
friendish. That is a word of my own coining. Jen and I are more

<h2><a name="c20" id="c20"><i>In the Old John House</i></a>
</h2>

<p>When <i>The Woman Who Spanked the King</i> was accepted and
published by a New York magazine of some standing, quite a
sensation was produced in Blair Water and Shrewsbury, especially
when the incredible news was whispered from lip to lip that Emily
had actually been paid forty dollars for it. For the first time her
clan began to take her writing mania with some degree of
seriousness and Aunt Ruth gave up, finally and for ever, all slurs
over wasted time. The acceptance came at the psychological moment
when the sands of Emily's faith were running rather low. All the
fall and winter her stuff had been coming back to her, except from
two magazines whose editors evidently thought that literature was
its own reward and quite independent of degrading monetary
considerations. At first she had always felt dreadfully when a poem
or story over which she had agonized came back with one of those
icy little rejection slips or a few words of faint praise&mdash;the
"but" rejections, Emily called these, and hated them worse than the
printed ones. Tears of disappointment <i>would</i> come. But after
a time she got hardened to it and didn't mind&mdash;so much. She
only gave the editorial slip the Murray look and said "I will
succeed." And never at any time had she any <i>real</i> doubt that
she would. Down, deep down, something told her that her time would
come. So, though she flinched momentarily at each rejection, as
from the flick of a whip, she sat down and&mdash;wrote another
story.</p>

<p>Still, her inner voice had grown rather faint under so many
discouragements. The acceptance of <i>The Woman Who Spanked the
King</i> suddenly raised it into a joyous paean of certainty again.
The cheque meant much, but the storming of that magazine much more.
She felt that she was surely winning a foothold. Mr. Carpenter
chuckled over it and told her it really was "absolutely good."</p>

<p>"The best in this story belongs to Mistress McIntyre," said
Emily ruefully. "I can't call it mine."</p>

<p>"The setting is yours&mdash;and what you've added harmonizes
perfectly with your foundation. And you didn't polish hers up too
much&mdash;<i>that</i> shows the artist. Weren't you tempted
to?"</p>

<p>"Yes. There were so many places I thought I <i>could</i> improve
it a good deal."</p>

<p>"But you didn't try to&mdash;<i>that</i> makes it yours," said
Mr. Carpenter&mdash;and left her to puzzle his meaning out for
herself.</p>

<p>Emily spent thirty-five of her dollars so sensibly that even
Aunt Ruth herself couldn't find fault with her budget. But with the
remaining five she bought a set of Parkman. It was a much nicer set
than the prize one&mdash;which the donor had really picked out of a
mail-order list&mdash;and Emily felt much prouder of it than if it
had been the prize. After all, it was better to earn things for
yourself. Emily has those Parkmans yet&mdash;somewhat faded and
frayed now, but dearer to her than all the other volumes in her
library. For a few weeks she was very happy and uplifted. The
Murrays were proud of her. Principal Hardy had congratulated her, a
local elocutionist of some repute had read her story at a concert
in Charlottetown. And, most wonderful of all, a far-away reader in
Mexico had written her a letter telling her what pleasure <i>The
Woman Who Spanked the King</i> had given him. Emily read and
re-read that letter until she knew it off by heart, and slept with
it under her pillow. No lover's missive was ever more tenderly
treated.</p>

<p>Then the affair of the old John house came up like a
thunder-cloud and darkened all her cerulean sky.</p>

<p>There was a concert and "pie social" at Derry Pond one Friday
night and Ilse had been asked to recite. Dr. Burnley took Ilse and
Emily and Perry and Teddy over in his big, double-seated sleigh,
and they had a gay and merry eight miles' drive through the soft
snow that was beginning to fall. When the concert was half over,
Dr. Burnley was summoned out. There was sudden and serious illness
in a Derry Pond household. The doctor went, telling Teddy that he
must drive the party home. Dr. Burnley made no bones about it. They
might have silly rules about chaperonage in Shrewsbury and
Charlottetown, but in Blair Water and Derry Pond they did not
obtain. Teddy and Perry were decent boys&mdash;Emily was a
Murray&mdash;Ilse was no fool. The doctor would have summed them up
thus tersely if he had thought about it at all.</p>

<p>When the concert was over they left for home. It was snowing
very thickly now and the wind was rising rapidly, but the first
three miles of the road were through sheltering woods and were not
unpleasant. There was a wild, weird beauty in the snow-coated ranks
of trees, standing in the pale light of the moon behind the
storm-clouds. The sleigh-bells laughed at the shriek of the wind
far overhead. Teddy managed the doctor's team without difficulty.
Once or twice Emily had a strong suspicion that he was using only
one arm to drive them. She wondered if he had noticed that evening
that she wore her hair really "up" for the first time&mdash;in a
soft ebon "Psyche knot" under her crimson hat. Emily thought again
that there was something quite delightful about a storm.</p>

<p>But when they left the woods their troubles began. The storm
swooped down on them in all its fury. The winter road went through
the fields and wound and twisted and doubled in and out and around
corners and spruce groves&mdash;a road that would "break a snake's
back," as Perry said. The track was already almost obliterated with
the drift and the horses plunged to their knees. They had not gone
a mile before Perry whistled in dismay.</p>

<p>"We'll never make Blair Water to-night, Ted."</p>

<p>"We've got to make somewhere," shouted Ted. "We can't camp
<i>here.</i> And there's no house till we get back to the summer
road, past Shaw's hill. Duck under the robes, girls. You'd better
get back with Ilse, Emily, and Perry will come here with me."</p>

<p>The transfer was effected, Emily no longer thinking storms quite
so delightful. Perry and Teddy were both thoroughly alarmed. They
knew the horses could not go much farther in that depth of
snow&mdash;the summer road beyond Shaw's hill would be blocked with
drift&mdash;and it was bitterly cold on those high, bleak hills
between the valleys of Derry Pond and Blair Water.</p>

<p>"If we can only get to Malcolm Shaw's we'll be all right,"
muttered Perry.</p>

<p>"We'll never get that far. Shaw's hill is filled in by this time
to the fence-tops," said Teddy. "Here's the old John house. Do you
suppose we could stay here?"</p>

<p>"Cold as a barn," said Perry. "The girls would freeze. We must
try to make Malcolm's."</p>

<p>When the plunging horses reached the summer road, the boys saw
at a glance that Shaw's hill was a hopeless proposition. All traces
of track were obliterated by drifts that were over the fence-tops.
Telephone-posts were blown down across the road and a huge, fallen
tree blocked the gap where the field road ran out to it.</p>

<p>"Nothing to do but go back to the old John house," said Perry.
"We can't go wandering over the fields in the teeth of this storm,
looking for a way through to Malcolm's. We'd get stuck and freeze
to death."</p>

<p>Teddy turned the horses. The snow was thicker than ever. Every
minute the drift deepened. The track was entirely gone, and if the
old John house had been very far away they could never have found
it. Fortunately, it was near, and after one last wild flounder
through the unbroken drift around it, during which the boys had to
get out and scramble along on their own feet, they reached the
comparative calm of the little cleared space in the young spruce
woods, wherein stood the old John house.</p>

<p>The "old John house" had been old when, forty years before, John
Shaw had moved into it with his young bride. It had been a lonely
spot even then, far back from the road, and almost surrounded by
spruce woods. John Shaw had lived there five years; then his wife
died; he had sold the farm to his brother Malcolm and gone West.
Malcolm farmed the land and kept the little barn in good repair,
but the house had never been occupied since, save for a few weeks
in winter when Malcolm's boys camped there while they "got out"
their firewood. It was not even locked. Tramps and burglars were
unknown in Derry Pond. Our castaways found easy entrance through
the door of the tumbledown porch and drew a breath of relief to
find themselves out of the shrieking wind and driving snow.</p>

<p>"We won't freeze anyhow," said Perry. "Ted and I'll have to see
if we can get the horses in the barn and then we'll come back and
see if we can't make ourselves comfortable. I've got matches and
I've never been stumped yet."</p>

<p>Perry met no great difficulties in making good his boast. His
lighted match revealed a couple of half-burned candles in squat tin
candlesticks, a cracked and rusty but still quite serviceable old
Waterloo stove, three chairs, a bench, a sofa and a table.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with this?" demanded Perry.</p>

<p>"They'll be awfully worried about us at home, that's all," said
Emily, shaking the snow off her wraps.</p>

<p>"Worry won't kill them in one night," said Perry. "We'll get
home to-morrow somehow."</p>

<p>"Meanwhile, this is an adventure," laughed Emily. "Let's get all
the fun out of it we can."</p>

<p>Ilse said nothing&mdash;which was very odd in Ilse. Emily,
looking at her, saw that she was very pale and recalled that she
had been unusually quiet ever since they had left the hall.</p>

<p>"Aren't you feeling all right, Ilse?" she asked anxiously.</p>

<p>"I'm feeling all wrong," said Ilse, with a ghastly smile.
"I'm&mdash;I'm sick as a dog," she added, with more force than
elegance.</p>

<p>"Oh, Ilse&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't hit the ceiling," said Ilse impatiently. "I'm not
beginning pneumonia or appendicitis. I'm just plain <i>sick.</i>
That pie I had at the hall was too rich, I suppose. It's turned my
little tummy upside down. O&mdash;w&mdash;w."</p>

<p>"Lie down on the sofa," urged Emily. "Perhaps you'll feel better
then."</p>

<p>Ilse, shuddering and abject, cast herself down. A "sick stomach"
is not a romantic ailment or a very deadly one, but it certainly
takes the ginger out of its victim for the time being.</p>

<p>The boys, finding a box full of wood behind the stove, soon had
a roaring fire. Perry took one of the candles and explored the
little house. In a small room opening off the kitchen was an
old-fashioned wooden bedstead with a rope mattress. The other
room&mdash;it had been Almira Shaw's parlour in olden
days&mdash;was half filled with oat-straw. Upstairs there was
nothing but emptiness and dust. But in the little pantry Perry made
some finds.</p>

<p>"There's a can of pork and beans here," he announced, "and a tin
box half full of crackers. I see our breakfast. I s'pose the Shaw
boys left them here. And what's this?"</p>

<p>Perry brought out a small bottle, uncorked and sniffed it
solemnly.</p>

<p>"Whisky, as I'm a living sinner. Not much, but enough. Here's
your medicine, Ilse. You take it in some hot water and it'll settle
your stomach in a jiffy."</p>

<p>"I hate the taste of whisky," moaned Ilse. "Father never uses
it&mdash;he doesn't believe in it."</p>

<p>"Aunt Tom does," said Perry, as if that settled the matter.
"It's a sure cure. Try it and see."</p>

<p>"But there isn't any water," said Ilse.</p>

<p>"You'll have to take it straight, then. There's only about two
tablespoons in the bottle. Try it. It won't kill you if it doesn't
cure you."</p>

<p>Poor Ilse was really feeling so abjectly wretched that she would
have taken anything, short of poison, if she thought there was any
chance of its helping her. She crawled off the sofa, sat down on a
chair before the fire and swallowed the dose. It was good, strong
whisky&mdash;Malcolm Shaw could have told you that. And I think
there was really more than two tablespoonfuls in the bottle, though
Perry always insisted that there wasn't. Ilse sat huddled in her
chair for a few minutes longer, then she got up and put her hand
uncertainly on Emily's shoulder.</p>

<p>"Do you feel worse?" asked Emily, anxiously.</p>

<p>"I'm&mdash;I'm drunk," said Ilse. "Help me back to the sofa, for
mercy's sake. My legs are going to double up under me. Who was the
Scotchman up at Malvern who said he never got drunk but the whisky
always settled in his knees? But mine's in the head too. It's
spinning round."</p>

<p>Perry and Teddy both sprang to help her and between them a very
wobbly Ilse made safe port on the sofa again.</p>

<p>"Is there anything we can do?" implored Emily.</p>

<p>"Too much has already been done," said Ilse with preternatural
solemnity. She shut her eyes and not another word would she say in
response to any entreaty. Finally it was deemed best to let her
alone.</p>

<p>"She'll sleep it off, and, anyway, I guess it'll settle her
stomach," said Perry.</p>

<p>Emily could not take it so philosophically. Not until Ilse's
quiet breathing half an hour later proved that she was really
asleep could Emily begin to taste the flavour of their "adventure."
The wind threshed about the old house and rattled the windows as if
in a fury over their escape from it. It was very pleasant to sit
before the stove and listen to the wild melody of defeated
storm&mdash;very pleasant to think about the vanished life of this
old dead house, in the years when it had been full of love and
laughter&mdash;very pleasant to talk of cabbages and kings with
Perry and Teddy, in the faint glow of candlelight&mdash;very
pleasant to sit in occasional silences, staring into the firelight,
which flickered alluringly over Emily's milk-white brow and
haunting, shadowy eyes. Once Emily, glancing up suddenly, found
Teddy looking at her strangely. For just a moment their eyes met
and locked&mdash;only a moment&mdash;yet Emily was never really to
belong to herself again. She wondered dazedly what had happened.
Whence came that wave of unimaginable sweetness that seemed to
engulf her, body and spirit? She trembled&mdash;she was afraid. It
seemed to open such dizzying possibilities of change. The only
clear idea that emerged from her confusion of thought was that she
wanted to sit with Teddy before a fire like this every night of
their lives&mdash;and then a fig for the storms! She dared not look
at Teddy again, but she thrilled with a delicious sense of his
nearness; she was acutely conscious of his tall, boyish
straightness, his glossy black hair, his luminous dark-blue eyes.
She had always known she liked Teddy better than any other male
creature in her ken&mdash;but <i>this</i> was something apart from
liking altogether&mdash;this sense of belonging to him that had
come in that significant exchange of glances. All at once she
seemed to know why she had always snubbed any of the High School
boys who wanted to be her beau.</p>

<p>The delight of the spell that had been suddenly laid on her was
so intolerable that she must break it. She sprang up and went over
to the window. The little hissing whisper of snow against the
blue-white frost crystals on the pane seemed softly to scorn her
bewilderment. The three big haystacks, thatched with snow, dimly
visible at the corner of the barn, seemed to be shaking their
shoulders with laughter over her predicament. The fire in the stove
reflected out in the clearing seemed like a mocking goblin bonfire
under the firs. Beyond it, through the woods, were unfathomable
spaces of white storm. For a moment Emily wished she were out in
them&mdash;there would be freedom there from this fetter of
terrible delight that had so suddenly and inexplicably made her a
prisoner&mdash;her, who hated bonds.</p>

<p>"Am I falling in love with Teddy?" she thought. "I won't&mdash;I
won't."</p>

<p>Perry, quite unconscious of all that had happened in the wink of
an eye to Teddy and Emily, yawned and stretched.</p>

<p>"Guess we'd better hit the hay&mdash;the candles are about done.
I guess that straw will make a real good bed for us, Ted. Let's
carry enough out and pile it on the bedstead in there to make a
comfortable roost for the girls. With one of the fur rugs over it,
it won't be so bad. We ought to have some high old dreams
to-night&mdash;Ilse especially. Wonder if she's sober yet?"</p>

<p>"I've a pocket full of dreams to sell," said Teddy, whimsically,
with a new, unaccountable gaiety of voice and manner. "What d'ye
lack? What d'ye lack? A dream of success&mdash;a dream of
adventure&mdash;a dream of the sea&mdash;a dream of the
woodland&mdash;any kind of a dream you want at reasonable prices,
including one or two unique little nightmares. What will you give
me for a dream?"</p>

<p>Emily turned around&mdash;stared at him for a moment&mdash;then
forgot thrills and pells and everything else in a wild longing for
a Jimmy-book. As if his question, "What will you give me for a
dream?" had been a magic formula opening some sealed chamber in her
brain, she saw unrolling before her a dazzling idea for a
story&mdash;complete even to the title&mdash;<i>A Seller of
Dreams.</i> For the rest of that night Emily thought of nothing
else.</p>

<p>The boys went off to their straw couch, and Emily, after
deciding to leave Ilse, who seemed comfortable, on the sofa as long
as she slept, lay down on the bed in the small room. But not to
sleep. She had never felt less like sleeping. She did not want to
sleep. She had forgotten that she had been falling in love with
Teddy&mdash;she had forgotten everything but her wonderful idea;
chapter by chapter, page by page, it unrolled itself before her in
the darkness. Her characters lived and laughed and talked and did
and enjoyed and suffered&mdash;she saw them on the background of
the storm. Her cheeks burned, her heart beat, she tingled from head
to foot with the keen rapture of creation&mdash;a joy that sprang
fountain-like from the depths of being and seemed independent of
all earthly things. Ilse had got drunk on Malcolm Shaw's forgotten
Scotch whisky, but Emily was intoxicated with immortal wine.</p>

<h2><a name="c21" id="c21"><i>Thicker than Water</i></a>
</h2>

<p>Emily did not sleep until nearly morning. The storm had ceased
and the landscape around the old John house had a spectral look in
the light of the sinking moon when she finally drifted into
slumber, with a delightful sense of accomplishment&mdash;for she
had finished thinking out her story. Nothing remained now except to
jot its outlines down in her Jimmy-book. She would not feel safe
until she had them in black and white. She would not try to write
it yet&mdash;oh, not for years. She must wait until time and
experience had made of her pen an instrument capable of doing
justice to her conception&mdash;for it is one thing to pursue an
idea through an ecstatic night and quite another to get it down on
paper in a manner that will reproduce a tenth of its original charm
and significance.</p>

<p>Emily was wakened by Ilse, who was sitting on the side of her
bed, looking rather pale and seedy, but with amber eyes full of
unconquerable laughter.</p>

<p>"Well, I've slept off my debauch, Emily Starr. And my tummy's
all right this morning. Malcolm's whisky <i>did</i> settle
it&mdash;though I think the remedy is worse than the disease. I
suppose you wondered why I wouldn't talk last night."</p>

<p>"I thought you were too drunk to talk," said Emily candidly.</p>

<p>Ilse giggled.</p>

<p>"I was too drunk <i>not</i> to talk. When I got to that sofa,
Emily, my giddiness passed off and I <i>wanted</i> to
talk&mdash;oh, golly, but I wanted to talk! And I wanted to say the
silliest things and tell everything I ever knew or thought. I'd
just enough sense left to know I mustn't say those things or I'd
make a fool of myself for ever&mdash;and I felt that if I said
<i>one</i> word it would be like taking a cork out of a
bottle&mdash;<i>everything</i> would gurgle out. So I just buttoned
my mouth up and wouldn't say the one word. It gives me a chill to
think of the things I <i>could</i> have said&mdash;and before
Perry. You'll never catch your little Ilse going on a spree again.
I'm a reformed character from this day forth."</p>

<p>"What I can't understand," said Emily, "is how such a small dose
of <i>anything</i> could have turned your head like that."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, you know Mother was a Mitchell. It's a notorious fact
that the Mitchells can't take a teaspoonful of booze without
toppling. It's one of their family kinks. Well, rise up, my love,
my fair one. The boys are getting a fire on and Perry says we can
dope up a fair meal from the pork and beans and crackers. I'm
hungry enough to eat the cans."</p>

<p>It was while Emily was rummaging in the pantry in search of some
salt that she made a great discovery. Far back on the top shelf was
a pile of dusty old books&mdash;dating back probably to the days of
John and Almira Shaw&mdash;old, mildewed diaries, almanacs, account
books. Emily knocked the pile down and when she was picking it up
discovered that one of the books was an old scrap-book. A loose
leaf had fallen out of it. As Emily replaced it, her eyes fell on
the title of a poem pasted on it. She caught it up, her breath
coming quickly. <i>A Legend of Abegweit&mdash;</i>the poem with
which Evelyn had won the prize! Here it was in this old, yellowed
scrap-book of twenty years' vintage&mdash;word for word, except
that Evelyn had cut out two verses to shorten it to the required
length.</p>

<p>"And the two best verses in it," thought Emily, contemptuously.
"How like Evelyn! She has simply no literary judgment."</p>

<p>Emily replaced the books on the shelf, but she slipped the loose
leaf into her pocket and ate her share of breakfast very absently.
By this time men were on the roads breaking out the tracks. Perry
and Teddy found a shovel in the barn and soon had a way opened to
the road. They got home finally, after a slow but uneventful drive,
to find the New Moon folks rather anxious as to their fate and
mildly horrified to learn that they had had to spend the night in
the old John house.</p>

<p>"You might have caught your deaths of cold," said Elizabeth,
severely.</p>

<p>"Well, it was Hobson's choice. It was that or freeze to death in
the drifts," said Emily, and nothing more was said about the
matter. Since they had got home safe and nobody had caught cold,
what more <i>was</i> there to say? That was the New Moon way of
looking at it.</p>

<p>The Shrewsbury way was somewhat different. But the Shrewsbury
way did not become apparent immediately. The whole story was over
Shrewsbury by Monday night&mdash;Ilse told it in school and
described her drunken orgy with great spirit and vivacity, amid
shrieks of laughter from her classmates. Emily, who had called, for
the first time, on Evelyn Blake that evening, found Evelyn looking
quite well pleased over something.</p>

<p>"Can't you stop Ilse from telling that story, my dear?"</p>

<p>"What story?"</p>

<p>"Why, about getting drunk last Friday night&mdash;the night you
and she spent with Teddy Kent and Perry Miller in that old house up
at Derry Pond," said Evelyn smoothly.</p>

<p>Emily suddenly flushed. There was <i>something</i> in Evelyn's
tone&mdash;the innocent fact seemed all at once to take on shades
of a sinister significance. Was Evelyn being deliberately
insolent?</p>

<p>"I don't know why she shouldn't tell the story," said Emily,
coldly. "It was a good joke on her."</p>

<p>"But you know how people will talk," said Evelyn, gently. "It's
all rather&mdash;unfortunate. Of course, you couldn't help being
caught in the storm&mdash;I suppose&mdash;but Ilse will only make
matters worse. She is so indiscreet&mdash;haven't you <i>any</i>
influence over her, Emily?"</p>

<p>"I didn't come here to discuss that," said Emily, bluntly. "I
came to show you something I found in the old John house."</p>

<p>She held out the leaf of the scrap-book. Evelyn looked at it
blankly for a moment. Then her face turned a curious mottled
purple. She made an involuntary movement as if to snatch the paper,
but Emily quickly drew it back. Their eyes met. In that moment
Emily felt that the score between them was at last even.</p>

<p>She waited for Evelyn to speak. After a moment Evelyn did
speak&mdash;sullenly:</p>

<p>"Well, what are you going to do about it?"</p>

<p>"I haven't decided yet," said Emily.</p>

<p>Evelyn's long, brown, treacherous eyes swept up to Emily's face
with a crafty, seeking expression.</p>

<p>"I suppose you mean to take it to Dr. Hardy and disgrace me
before the school?"</p>

<p>"Well, you deserve it, don't you?" said Emily, judicially.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I wanted to win that prize because Father promised me a
trip to Vancouver next summer if I won it," muttered Evelyn,
suddenly crumpling. "I&mdash;I was crazy to go. Oh, <i>don't</i>
betray me, Emily&mdash;Father will be furious. I&mdash;I'll give
you the Parkman set&mdash;I'll do anything&mdash;only
don't&mdash;"</p>

<p>Evelyn began to cry. Emily didn't like the sight.</p>

<p>"I don't want your Parkman," she said, contemptuously, "But
there is one thing you must do. You will confess to Aunt Ruth that
it was you who drew that moustache on my face the day of the
English exam and not Ilse."</p>

<p>Evelyn wiped away her tears and swallowed something.</p>

<p>"That was only a joke," she sobbed.</p>

<p>"It was no joke to lie about it," said Emily, sternly.</p>

<p>"You're so&mdash;so&mdash;<i>blunt."</i> Evelyn looked for a dry
spot on her handkerchief and found one. "It was all a joke. I just
ran back from the Shoppe to do it. I thought, of course, you'd look
in the glass when you got up. I d-didn't suppose you'd g-go to
class like that. And I didn't know your Aunt took it so seriously.
Of course&mdash;I'll tell her&mdash;if you'll&mdash;if
you'll&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Write it out and sign it," said Emily, remorselessly.</p>

<p>Evelyn wrote it out and signed it.</p>

<p>"You'll give me&mdash;<i>that,"</i> she pleaded, with an
entreating gesture towards the scrap-book leaf.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, I'll keep this," said Emily.</p>

<p>"And what assurance have I that you won't tell&mdash;some
day&mdash;after all?" sniffed Evelyn.</p>

<p>"You have the word of a Starr," said Emily, loftily.</p>

<p>She went out with a smile. She had finally conquered in the long
duel. And she held in her hand what would finally clear Ilse in
Aunt Ruth's eyes.</p>

<p>Aunt Ruth sniffed a good deal over Evelyn's note and was
inclined to ask questions as to how it had been extorted. But not
getting much satisfaction out of Emily on this score and knowing
that Allan Burnley had been sore at her ever since her banishment
of his daughter, she secretly welcomed an excuse to recall it.</p>

<p>"Very well, then. I told you Ilse could come here when you could
prove to my satisfaction that she had not played that trick on you.
You have proved it, and I keep my word. I am a just woman,"
concluded Aunt Ruth&mdash;who was, perhaps, the most unjust woman
on the earth at that time.</p>

<p>So far, well. But if Evelyn wanted revenge she tasted it to the
full in the next three weeks, without raising a finger or wagging a
tongue to secure it. All Shrewsbury burned with gossip about the
night of the storm&mdash;insinuations, distortions, wholesale
fabrications. Emily was so snubbed at Janet Thompson's afternoon
tea that she went home white with humiliation. Ilse was
furious.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't mind if I <i>had</i> been rip-roaring drunk and had
the fun of it," she vowed with a stamp of her foot. "But I wasn't
drunk enough to be happy&mdash;only just drunk enough to be silly.
There are moments, Emily, when I feel that I could have a gorgeous
time if I were a cat and these old Shrewsbury dames were mice. But
let's keep our smiles pinned on. I really don't care a snap for
them. This will soon die out. We'll fight."</p>

<p>"You can't fight insinuations," said Emily, bitterly.</p>

<p>Ilse did not care&mdash;but Emily cared horribly. The Murray
pride smarted unbearably. And it smarted worse and worse as time
went on. A sneer at the night of the storm was published in a rag
of a paper that was printed in a town on the mainland and made up
of "spicy" notes sent to it from all over the Maritimes. Nobody
ever confessed to reading it, but almost everybody knew everything
that was in it&mdash;except Aunt Ruth, who wouldn't have handled
the sheet with the tongs. No names were mentioned, but every one
knew who was referred to, and the venomous innuendo of the thing
was unmistakable. Emily thought she would die of shame. And the
worst sting was that it was so vulgar and ugly&mdash;and had made
that beautiful night of laughter and revelation and rapturous
creation in the old John house vulgar and ugly. She had thought it
would always be one of her most beautiful memories. And now
this!</p>

<p>Teddy and Perry saw red and wanted to kill somebody, but whom
could they kill? As Emily told them, anything they said or did
would only make the matter worse. It was bad enough after the
publication of that paragraph. Emily was not invited to Florence
Blake's dance the next week&mdash;the great social event of the
winter. She was left out of Hattie Denoon's skating party. Several
of the Shrewsbury matrons did not see her when they met her on the
streets. Others set her a thousand miles away by bland, icy
politeness. Some young men about town grew oddly familiar in look
and manner. One of them, with whom she was totally unacquainted,
spoke to her one evening in the Post Office. Emily turned and
looked at him. Crushed, humiliated as she was, she was still
Archibald Murray's granddaughter. The wretched youth was three
blocks away from the Post Office before he came to himself and knew
where he was. To this day he has not forgotten how Emily Byrd
Starr's eyes looked when she was angry.</p>

<p>But even the Murray look, while it might demolish a concrete
offender, could not scotch scandalous stories. Everybody, she felt
morbidly, believed them. It was reported to her that Miss Percy of
the library said she had always distrusted Emily Starr's
smile&mdash;she had always felt sure it was deliberately
provocative and alluring. Emily felt that she, like poor King
Henry, would never smile again. People remembered that old Nancy
Priest had been a wild thing seventy years ago&mdash;and hadn't
there been some scandal about Mrs. Dutton herself in her girlhood?
What's bred in the bone, you understand. Her mother had eloped,
hadn't she? And Ilse's mother? Of course, she had been killed by
falling into the old Lee well, but who knew what she would have
done if she hadn't? Then there was that old story of bathing on
Blair Water sandshore, <i>au naturel.</i> In short, you didn't see
ankles like Emily's on proper girls. They simply didn't have
them.</p>

<p>Even harmless, unnecessary Andrew had ceased to call on Friday
nights. There <i>was</i> a sting in this. Emily thought Andrew a
bore and dreaded his Friday nights. She had always meant to send
him packing as soon as he gave her an opportunity. But for Andrew
to go packing of his own accord had a very different flavour, mark
you. Emily clenched her hands when she thought of it.</p>

<p>A bitter report came to her ears that Principal Hardy had said
she ought to resign from the presidency of the Senior Class. Emily
threw up her head. Resign? Confess defeat and admit guilt? Not
she!</p>

<p>"I could knock that man's block off," said Ilse. "Emily Starr,
don't let yourself worry over this. What does it matter what a lot
of doddering old donkeys think? I hereby devote them to the
infernal gods. They'll have their maws full of something else in a
month and they'll forget this."</p>

<p>"<i>I</i>'ll never forget it," said Emily, passionately. "To my
dying day I'll remember the humiliation of these weeks. And
now&mdash;Ilse, Mrs. Tolliver has written asking me to give up my
stall at the St. John's bazaar."</p>

<p>"Emily Starr&mdash;she hasn't!"</p>

<p>"She has. Oh, of course, she cloaks it under an excuse that
she'd like a stall for her cousin from New York, who is visiting
her&mdash;but <i>I</i> understand. And it's 'Dear Miss
Starr'&mdash;look you&mdash;when it was 'Dearest Emily' a few weeks
ago. Everybody in St. John's will know why I've been asked to step
out. And she almost went on her knees to Aunt Ruth to let me take
the stall. Aunt Ruth didn't want to let me."</p>

<p>"What will your Aunt Ruth say about this?"</p>

<p>"Oh, that's the worst of it, Ilse. She'll have to know now.
She's never heard a word of this since she's been laid up with her
sciatica. I've lived in dread of her finding out&mdash;for I know
it will be hideous when she does. She's getting about now, so of
course she'd soon hear it, anyway. And I haven't the spirit to
stand up to her, Ilse. Oh, it all seems like a nightmare."</p>

<p>"They've got such mean, narrow, malicious, beastly little minds
in this town," said Ilse&mdash;and was straightway comforted. But
Emily could not ease her tortured spirit by a choice assortment of
adjectives. Neither could she write out her misery and so rid
herself of it. There were no more jottings in her Jimmy-book, no
further entries in her journal, no new stories or poems. The flash
never came now&mdash;never would come again. There would never
again be wonderful little secret raptures of insight and creation
which no one could share. Life had grown thin and poor, tarnished
and unlovely. There was no beauty in anything&mdash;not even in the
golden-white March solitudes of New Moon, when she went home for
the week-end. She had longed to go home, where no one believed ill
of her. No one at New Moon had heard anything of what was being
whispered in Shrewsbury. But there very ignorance tortured Emily.
Soon they <i>would</i> know; they would be hurt and grieved over
the fact that a Murray, even an innocent Murray, had become a
target for scandal. And who knew how they would regard Ilse's
mishap with Malcolm's Scotch? Emily felt it almost a relief to go
back to Shrewsbury.</p>

<p>She imagined slurs in everything Principal Hardy
said&mdash;covert insults in every remark or look of her
schoolmates. Only Evelyn Blake posed as friend and defender, and
this was the most unkindest cut of all. Whether alarm or malice was
beyond Evelyn's pose, Emily did not know&mdash;but she did know
that Evelyn's parade of friendship and loyalty and staunch belief
in the face of overwhelming evidence, was something that seemed to
smirch her more than all the gossip could. Evelyn went about
assuring every one that <i>she</i> wouldn't believe one word
against "poor dear Emily." Poor dear Emily could have cheerfully
watched her drown&mdash;or thought she could.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Aunt Ruth, who had been confined to her house for
several weeks with sciatica and had been so crusty with it that
neither friends nor enemies had dared to hint anything to her of
the gossip concerning her niece, was beginning to take notice. Her
sciatica had departed and left her faculties free to concentrate on
other things. She recalled that Emily's appetite had been poor for
days and Aunt Ruth suspected that she had not been sleeping. The
moment this suspicion occurred to Aunt Ruth she took action. Secret
worries were not to be tolerated in her house.</p>

<p>"Emily, I want to know what is the matter with you," she
demanded, one Saturday afternoon when Emily pale and listless, with
purple smudges under her eyes, had eaten next to nothing for
dinner.</p>

<p>A little colour came into Emily's face. The hour she had dreaded
so was upon her. Aunt Ruth must be told all. And Emily felt
miserably that she had neither the courage to endure the resultant
heckling nor the spirit to hold her own against Aunt Ruth's whys
and wherefores. She knew so well how it would all be: horror over
the John house episode&mdash;as if anybody could have helped it:
annoyance over the gossip&mdash;as if Emily were responsible for
it: several assurances that she had always expected something like
this: and then intolerable weeks of reminders and slurs. Emily felt
a sort of mental nausea at the whole prospect. For a minute she
could not speak.</p>

<p>"What have you been doing?" persisted Aunt Ruth.</p>

<p>Emily set her teeth. It was unendurable, but it must be endured.
The story had to be told&mdash;the only thing to do was to get it
told as soon as possible.</p>

<p>"I haven't done anything wrong, Aunt Ruth. I've just done
something that has been misunderstood."</p>

<p>Aunt Ruth sniffed. But she listened without interruption to
Emily's story. Emily told it as briefly as possible, feeling as if
she were a criminal in the witness box with Aunt Ruth as judge,
jury and prosecuting attorney all in one. When she had finished she
sat in silence waiting for some characteristic Aunt Ruthian
comment.</p>

<p>"And what are they making all the fuss about?" said Aunt
Ruth.</p>

<p>Emily didn't know exactly what to say. She stared at Aunt
Ruth.</p>

<p>"They&mdash;they're thinking&mdash;and saying all sorts of
horrible things," she faltered. "You see&mdash;down here in
sheltered Shrewsbury they didn't realize what a storm it was. And
then, of course, every one who repeated the story coloured it a
little&mdash;we were <i>all</i> drunk by the time it filtered
through Shrewsbury."</p>

<p>"What exasperates me," said Aunt Ruth, "is to think you told
about it in Shrewsbury at all. Why on earth didn't you keep it all
quiet?"</p>

<p>"That would have been <i>sly</i>." Emily's demon suddenly
prompted her to say this. Now that the story was out she felt a
rebound of spirit that was almost laughter.</p>

<p>"Sly! It would have been common sense," snorted Aunt Ruth. "But,
of course, Ilse couldn't hold her tongue. I've often told you,
Emily, that a fool friend is ten times more dangerous than an
enemy. But what are you killing yourself worrying for? <i>Your</i>
conscience is clear. This gossip will soon die out."</p>

<p>"Principal Hardy says I ought to resign from the presidency of
the class," said Emily.</p>

<p>"Jim Hardy! Why, his Father was a hired boy to my Grandfather
for years," said Aunt Ruth in tones of ineffable contempt. "Does
Jim Hardy imagine that <i>my niece</i> would behave
improperly?"</p>

<p>Emily felt herself all at sea. She thought she really must be
dreaming. Was this incredible woman Aunt Ruth? It couldn't be Aunt
Ruth. Emily was up against one of the contradictions of human
nature. She was learning that you may fight with your
kin&mdash;disapprove of them&mdash;even hate them, but that there
is a bond between you for all that. Somehow, your very nerves and
sinews are twisted with theirs. Blood is always thicker than water.
Let an outsider attack&mdash;that's all. Aunt Ruth had at least one
of the Murray virtues&mdash;loyalty to clan.</p>

<p>"Don't worry over Jim Hardy," said Aunt Ruth. "I'll soon settle
him. I'll teach people to keep their tongues off the Murrays."</p>

<p>"But Mrs. Tolliver has asked me to let her cousin take my stall
in the bazaar," said Emily. "You know what that means."</p>

<p>"I know that Polly Tolliver is an upstart and a fool," retorted
Aunt Ruth. "Ever since Nat Tolliver married his stenographer, St.
John's Church hasn't been the same place. Ten years ago she was a
barefooted girl running round the back streets of Charlottetown.
The cats themselves wouldn't have brought her in. Now she puts on
the airs of a queen and tries to run the church. I'll soon clip
<i>her</i> claws. She was pretty thankful a few weeks ago to have a
Murray in her stall. It was a rise in the world for <i>her.</i>
Polly Tolliver, forsooth. What is this world coming to?"</p>

<p>Aunt Ruth sailed upstairs, leaving a dazed Emily looking at
vanishing bogies. Aunt Ruth came down again, ready for the warpath.
She had taken out her crimps, put on her best bonnet, her best
black silk, and her new sealskin coat. Thus arrayed she skimmed
uptown to the Tolliver residence on the hill. She remained there
half an hour closeted with Mrs. Nat Tolliver. Aunt Ruth was a
short, fat, little woman, looking very dowdy and old-fashioned in
spite of new bonnet and sealskin coat. Mrs. Nat was the last word
in fashion and elegance, with her Paris gown, her lorgnette and her
beautifully marcelled hair&mdash;marcels were just coming in then
and Mrs. Nat's was the first in Shrewsbury. But the victory of the
encounter did not perch on Mrs. Tolliver's standard. Nobody knows
just what was said at that notable interview. Certainly Mrs.
Tolliver never told. But when Aunt Ruth left the big house Mrs.
Tolliver was crushing her Paris gown and her marcel waves among the
cushions of her davenport while she wept tears of rage and
humiliation; and Aunt Ruth carried a note in her muff to Mrs.
Tolliver's "Dear Emily," saying that her cousin was not going to
take part in the bazaar and would "Dear Emily" be so kind as to
take the stall as at first planned. Dr. Hardy was next interviewed,
and again Aunt Ruth went, saw, conquered. The maid in the Hardy
household heard and reported one sentence of the confab, though
nobody ever believed that Aunt Ruth really said to stately,
spectacled Dr. Hardy,</p>

<p>"I know you're a fool, Jim Hardy, but for heaven's sake pretend
you're not for five minutes!"</p>

<p>No, the thing was impossible. Of course, the maid invented
it.</p>

<p>"You won't have much more trouble, Emily," said Aunt Ruth on her
return home. "Polly and Jim have got their craws full. When people
see you at the bazaar they'll soon realise what way the wind blows
and trim their sails accordingly. I've a few things to say to some
other folks when opportunity offers. Matters have come to a pretty
pass if decent boys and girls can't escape freezing to death
without being slandered for it. Don't you give this thing another
thought, Emily. Remember, you've got a family behind you."</p>

<p>Emily went to her glass when Aunt Ruth had gone downstairs. She
tilted it at the proper angle and smiled at
Emily-in-the-Glass&mdash;smiled slowly, provocatively,
alluringly.</p>

<p>"I wonder where I put my Jimmy-book," thought Emily. "I must add
a few more touches to my sketch of Aunt Ruth."</p>

<h2><a name="c22" id="c22"><i>"Love Me, Love My Dog"</i></a>
</h2>

<p>When Shrewsbury people discovered that Mrs. Dutton was backing
her niece, the flame of gossip that had swept over the town died
down in an incredibly short time. Mrs. Dutton gave more to the
various funds of St. John's Church than any other member&mdash;it
was a Murray tradition to support your church becomingly. Mrs.
Dutton had lent money to half the business men in town&mdash;she
held Nat Tolliver's note for an amount that kept him wakeful o'
nights. Mrs. Dutton had a disconcerting knowledge of family
skeletons&mdash;to which she had no delicacy in referring.
Therefore, Mrs. Dutton was a person to be kept in good humour, and
if people had made the mistake of supposing that because she was
very strict with her niece, it was safe to snub that niece, why,
the sooner they corrected that mistake the better for all
concerned.</p>

<p>Emily sold baby jackets and blankets and bootees and bonnets in
Mrs. Tolliver's stall at the big bazaar and wheedled elderly
gentlemen into buying them, with her now famous smile; everybody
was nice to her and she was happy again, though the experience had
left a scar. Shrewsbury folks in after years said that Emily Starr
had never really forgiven them for having talked about
her&mdash;and added that the Murrays never did forgive, you know.
But forgiveness did not enter into the matter. Emily had suffered
so horribly that henceforth the sight of any one who had been
connected with her suffering was hateful to her. When Mrs. Tolliver
asked her, a week later, to pour tea at the reception she was
giving her cousin, Emily declined politely, without troubling
herself to give any excuse. And something in the tilt of her chin,
or in the level glance of her eyes, made Mrs. Tolliver feel to her
marrow that she was still Polly Riordan of Riordan Alley, and would
never be anybody else in the sight of a Murray of New Moon.</p>

<p>But Andrew was welcomed quite sweetly when he somewhat
sheepishly called the following Friday night. It may be that he
felt a little doubtful of his reception, in spite of the fact that
he was sealed of the tribe. But Emily was markedly gracious to him.
Perhaps she had her own reasons for it. Again, I call attention to
the fact that I am Emily's biographer, not her apologist. If she
took a way to get even with Andrew which I may not approve, what
can I do but deplore it? For my own satisfaction, however, I may
remark in passing that I do think Emily went too far when she told
Andrew&mdash;after his report of some compliments his manager had
paid him&mdash;that he was certainly a wonder. I cannot even excuse
her by saying that she spoke in sarcastic tones. She did not: she
said it most sweetly with an upward glance followed by a downward
one that made even Andrew's well-regulated heart skip a beat. Oh,
Emily, Emily!</p>

<p>Things went well with Emily that Spring. She had several
acceptances and cheques, and was beginning to plume herself on
being quite a literary person. Her clan began to take her
scribbling mania somewhat seriously. Cheques were unanswerable
things.</p>

<p>"Emily has made fifty dollars by her pen since New Year's," Aunt
Ruth told Mrs. Drury. "I begin to think the child has an easy way
of making a living."</p>

<p>An easy way! Emily, overhearing this as she went through the
hall, smiled and sighed. What did Aunt Ruth&mdash;what did any one
know of the disappointments and failures of the climbers on Alpine
Paths? What did she know of the despairs and agonies of one who
<i>sees</i> but cannot <i>reach.</i> What did she know of the
bitterness of one who conceives a wonderful tale and writes it
down, only to find a flat and flavourless manuscript as a reward
for all her toil? What did she know of barred doors and impregnable
editorial sanctums? Of brutal rejection slips and the awfulness of
faint praise? Of hopes deferred and hours of sickening doubt and
self-distrust?</p>

<p>Aunt Ruth knew of none of these things, but she took to having
fits of indignation when Emily's manuscripts were returned.</p>

<p>"Impudence <i>I</i> call it," she said. "Don't send that editor
another line. Remember, you're a Murray!"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid he doesn't know that," said Emily, gravely.</p>

<p>"Then why don't you tell him?" said Aunt Ruth.</p>

<p>Shrewsbury had a mild sensation in May when Janet Royal came
home from New York with her wonderful dresses, her brilliant
reputation, and her chow dog. Janet was a Shrewsbury girl, but she
had never been home since she had "gone to the States" twenty years
ago. She was clever and ambitious and she had succeeded. She was
the literary editor of a big metropolitan woman's magazine and one
of the readers for a noted publishing house. Emily held her breath
when she heard of Miss Royal's arrival. Oh, if she could only see
her&mdash;have a talk with her&mdash;ask her about a hundred things
she wanted to know! When Mr. Towers told her in an off-hand manner
to go and interview Miss Royal and write it up for the
<i>Times,</i> Emily trembled between terror and delight. Here was
her excuse. But <i>could</i> she&mdash;had she assurance enough?
Wouldn't Miss Royal think her unbearably presumptuous? How could
<i>she</i> ask Miss Royal questions about her career and her
opinion of the United States' foreign policy and reciprocity? She
could never have the courage.</p>

<p>"We both worship at the same altar&mdash;but she is high
priestess and I am only the humblest acolyte," wrote Emily in her
journal.</p>

<p>Then she indited a very worshipful letter to Miss Royal, and
rewrote it a dozen times, asking permission to interview her. After
she had mailed it she could not sleep all night because it occurred
to her that she should have signed herself "yours truly" instead of
"yours sincerely." "Yours sincerely" smacked of an acquaintanceship
that did not exist. Miss Royal would surely think her
presuming.</p>

<p>But Miss Royal sent back a charming letter&mdash;Emily has it to
this day.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Ashburn, Monday.</p>

<p>"DEAR MISS STARR:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Of course you may come and see me and I'll tell you everything
you want to know for Jimmy Towers (God rest his soul, an' wasn't he
my first beau!) and everything you want to know for yourself. I
think half my reason for coming back to P. E. I. this spring was
because I wanted to see the writer of <i>The Woman Who Spanked the
King.</i> I read it last winter when it came out in <i>Roche's</i>
and I thought it charming. Come and tell me all about yourself and
your ambitions. You <i>are</i> ambitious, aren't you? And I think
you're going to be able to realize your ambitions, too, and I want
to help you if I can. You've got something I never had&mdash;real
creative ability&mdash;but I've heaps of experience and what I've
learned from it is yours for the asking. I <i>can</i> help you to
avoid some snares and pitfalls, and I'm not without a bit of 'pull'
in certain quarters. Come to Ashburn next Friday afternoon when
'school's out' and we'll have a heart-to-heart pow-wow.</p>

<p>"Yours fraternally,</p>

<p>"JANET ROYAL."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Emily thrilled to the ends of her toes when she read this
letter. "Yours fraternally"&mdash;oh, heavenly! She knelt at her
window and looked out with enraptured eyes into the slender firs of
the Land of Uprightness and the dewy young clover-fields beyond.
Oh, was it possible that some day she would be a brilliant,
successful woman like Miss Royal? That letter made it seem
possible&mdash;made every wonderful dream seem possible. And on
Friday&mdash;four more days&mdash;she was going to see and talk
intimately with her high priestess.</p>

<p>Mrs. Angela Royal, who called to see Aunt Ruth that evening,
didn't exactly seem to think Janet Royal a high priestess or a
wonder. But then, of course, a prophetess is apt to have scant
honour in her own country and Mrs. Royal had brought Janet up.</p>

<p>"I don't say but what she's got on well," she confided to Aunt
Ruth. "She gets a big salary. But she's an old maid for all that.
And as odd in some ways as Dick's hat-band."</p>

<p>Emily, studying Latin in the bay window, went on fire with
indignation. This was nothing short of <i>lese-majeste.</i></p>

<p>"She is very fine looking yet," said Aunt Ruth. "Janet was
always a nice girl."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, she's nice enough. But I was always afraid she was too
clever to get married, and I was right. And she's full of foreign
notions. She's never on time for her meals&mdash;and it really
makes me sick the fuss she makes over that dog of
hers&mdash;Chu-Chin, she calls it. <i>He</i> rules the house. He
does <i>exactly</i> as he likes and nobody dare say a word. My poor
cat can't call her soul her own. Janet is so touchy about him. When
I complained about him sleeping on the plush davenport she was so
vexed she wouldn't speak for a day. That's a thing I don't like
about Janet. She gets so high and mighty when she's offended. And
she gets offended at things nobody else would dream of minding. And
when she's offended with one she's offended with everybody. I hope
nothing will upset her before you come on Friday, Emily. If she's
out of humour she'll visit it on you. But I will say for her that
she doesn't often get vexed and there's nothing mean or grudging
about her. She'd work her fingers to the bone to serve a
friend."</p>

<p>When Aunt Ruth had gone out to interview the grocer's boy, Mrs.
Royal added hurriedly,</p>

<p>"She's greatly interested in you, Emily. She's always fond of
having pretty, fresh girls about her&mdash;says it keeps her
feeling young. She thinks your work shows real talent. If she takes
a fancy to you it would be a great thing for you. But, for pity's
sake, keep on good terms with that chow! If you offend <i>him,</i>
Janet wouldn't have anything to do with you supposing you were
Shakespeare himself."</p>

<p>Emily awoke Friday morning with the conviction that this was to
be one of the crucial days of her life&mdash;a day of dazzling
possibilities. She had had a terrible dream of sitting spellbound
before Miss Royal, unable to utter one word except "Chu-Chin,"
which she repeated parrot-like whenever Miss Royal asked her a
question.</p>

<p>It poured rain all the forenoon, much to her dismay, but at noon
it cleared up brilliantly and the hills across the harbour scarfed
themselves in fairy blue. Emily hurried home from school, pale with
the solemnity of the occasion. Her toilet was an important rite.
She must wear her new navy-blue silk&mdash;no question about that.
It was positively long and made her look fully grown up. But how
should she do her hair? The Psyche knot had more distinction,
suited her profile, and showed to better advantage under her hat.
Besides, perhaps a bare forehead made her look more intellectual.
But Mrs. Royal had said that Miss Royal liked pretty girls. Pretty,
therefore, she must be at all costs. The rich black hair was
dressed low on her forehead and crowned by the new spring hat which
Emily had dared to buy with her latest cheque, in spite of Aunt
Elizabeth's disapproval and Aunt Ruth's unvarnished statement that
a fool and her money were soon parted. But Emily was glad now that
she had bought the hat. She <i>couldn't</i> have gone to interview
Miss Royal in her plain black sailor. This hat was very becoming
with its cascade of purple violets that fell from it over the
lovely, unbroken waves of hair, just touching the milk-whiteness of
her neck. Everything about her was exquisitely neat and dainty: she
looked&mdash;I like the old phrase&mdash;as if she had just stepped
from a band-box. Aunt Ruth, prowling about the hall, saw her coming
downstairs and realized, with something of a shock, that Emily was
a young woman.</p>

<p>"She carries herself like a Murray," thought Aunt Ruth.</p>

<p>The force of commendation could no further go, though it was
really from the Starrs that Emily had inherited her slim elegance.
The Murrays were stately and dignified, but stiff.</p>

<p>It was quite a little walk to Ashburn, which was a fine old
white house set far back from the street amid great trees. Emily
went up the gravel walk, edged with its fine-fringed shadows of
spring, as a worshipper approaching a sacred fane. A fairly large,
fluffy white dog was sitting half-way up the gravel walk. Emily
looked at him curiously. She had never seen a chow dog. She decided
that Chu-Chin was handsome, but not clean. He had evidently been
having a glorious time in some mud puddle, for his paws and breast
were reeking. Emily hoped he would approve of her, but keep his
distance.</p>

<p>Evidently he approved of her, for he turned and trotted up the
walk with her, amiably waving a plumy tail&mdash;or rather a tail
that would have been plumy had it not been wet and muddy. He stood
expectantly beside her while she rang the bell, and as soon as the
door was opened he made a joyous bound on the lady who stood
within, almost knocking her over.</p>

<p>Miss Royal herself had opened the door. She had, as Emily saw at
once, no beauty, but unmistakable distinction, from the crown of
her gold-bronze hair to the toes of her satin slippers. She was
arrayed in some marvellous dress of mauve velvet and she wore
pince-nez with tortoise-shell rims, the first of their kind to be
seen in Shrewsbury.</p>

<p>Chu-Chin gave one rapturous, slobbery wipe at her face with his
tongue, then rushed on into Mrs. Royal's parlour. The beautiful
mauve dress was spotted from collar to hem with muddy paw-marks.
Emily thought that Chu-Chin fully deserved Mrs. Royal's bad opinion
and mentally remarked that if he were <i>her</i> dog he should
behave better. But Miss Royal did not reprove him in any way, and
perhaps Emily's secret criticism was subconsciously prompted by her
instant perception that Miss Royal's greeting, while perfectly
courteous, was very cold. From her letter Emily had somehow
expected a warmer reception.</p>

<p>"Won't you come in and sit down?" said Miss Royal. She ushered
Emily in, waved to a comfortable chair, and sat down on a stiff and
uncompromising Chippendale one. Somehow, Emily, sensitive at all
times and abnormally so just now, felt that Miss Royal's selection
of a chair was ominous. Why hadn't she sunk chummily into the
depths of the big velvet morris? But there she sat, a stately,
aloof figure, having apparently paid not the slightest attention to
the appalling mud-stains on her beautiful dress. Chu-Chin had
jumped on the big plush davenport, where he sat, cockily looking
from one to the other as if enjoying the situation. It was all too
evident that, as Mrs. Royal had foreboded, something had "upset"
Miss Royal, and Emily's heart suddenly sank like lead.</p>

<p>"It's&mdash;a lovely day," she faltered. She knew it was an
incredibly stupid thing to say, but she had to say something when
Miss Royal wouldn't say anything. The silence was too awful.</p>

<p>"Very lovely," agreed Miss Royal, not looking at Emily at all
but at Chu-Chin, who was thumping a beautiful silk and lace cushion
of Mrs. Royal's with his wet tail. Emily hated Chu-Chin. It was a
relief to hate him, since as yet she did not dare to hate Miss
Royal. But she wished herself a thousand miles away. Oh, if she
only hadn't that little bundle of manuscripts on her lap! It was so
evident what it was. She would never dare to show one of them to
Miss Royal. Was this outraged empress the writer of that kind,
friendly letter? It was impossible to believe it. This must be a
nightmare. Her dream was "out" with a vengeance. She felt crude and
bread-and-buttery and ignorant and dowdy&mdash;and young! Oh, so
horribly young!</p>

<p>The moments passed&mdash;not so very many, perhaps, but seeming
like hours to Emily. Her mouth was dry and parched, her brain
paralysed. She couldn't think of a solitary thing to say. A
horrible suspicion flashed across her mind that, since writing her
letter, Miss Royal had heard the gossip about the night in the old
John house and that her altered attitude was the result.</p>

<p>In her misery Emily squirmed in her chair and her little packet
of manuscripts slipped to the floor. Emily stooped to retrieve it.
At the same moment Chu-Chin made a flying leap from the davenport
at it. His muddy paws caught the spray of violets hanging from
Emily's hat and tore it loose. Emily let go of her packet and
clutched her hat. Chu-Chin let go of the violets and pounced on the
packet. Then, holding that in his mouth, he bolted out of the open
glass door leading to the garden.</p>

<p>"Oh, what a relief it would be to tear my hair," thought Emily
violently.</p>

<p>That diabolical chow had carried off her latest and best story
and a number of choice poems. Heaven knew what he would do with
them. She supposed she would never see them again. But, at least,
there was fortunately now no question of showing them to Miss
Royal.</p>

<p>Emily no longer cared whether Miss Royal was in a bad humour or
not. She was no longer desirous of pleasing her&mdash;a woman who
would let her dog behave like that to an invited guest and never
reprove him! Nay, she even seemed to be amused at his antics. Emily
was sure she had detected a fleeting smile on Miss Royal's arrogant
face as she looked at the ruined violets scattered over the
floor.</p>

<p>There suddenly popped into Emily's mind a story she had heard of
Lofty John's father, who was in the habit of telling his wife,</p>

<p>"When people do be after snubbing you, Bridget, pull up your
lip, Bridget, pull up your lip."</p>

<p>Emily pulled up her lip.</p>

<p>"A very playful dog," she said sarcastically.</p>

<p>"Very," agreed Miss Royal composedly.</p>

<p>"Don't you think a little discipline would improve him?" asked
Emily.</p>

<p>"No, I do not think so," said Miss Royal meditatively.</p>

<p>Chu-Chin returned at this moment, capered about the room,
knocked a small glass vase off a taboret with a whisk of his tail,
sniffed at the ensuing fragments, then bounded up on the davenport
again, where he sat panting. "Oh, what a good dog am I!"</p>

<p>Emily picked up her note-book and pencil.</p>

<p>"Mr. Towers sent me to interview you," she said.</p>

<p>"So I understand," said Miss Royal, never taking her eyes off
her worshipped chow.</p>

<p><i>Emily:</i> "May I trouble you to answer a few questions?"</p>

<p><i>Miss Royal, with exaggerated amiability:</i> "Charmed."</p>

<p>(Chu-Chin, having saved enough breath, springs from the
davenport and rushes through the half-opened folding doors of the
dining-room.)</p>

<p><i>Emily, consulting note-book and recklessly asking the first
question jotted down therein:</i> "What do you think will be the
result of the Presidential election this fall?"</p>

<p>(Emily, with compressed lips, writes down in her note-book: "She
never thinks about it." Chu-Chin reappears, darts through parlour
and out into the garden, carrying a roast chicken in his
mouth.)</p>

<p><i>Miss Royal:</i> "There goes my supper."</p>

<p><i>Emily, checking off first questions:</i> "Is there any
likelihood that the United States Congress will look favourably on
the recent reciprocity proposals of the Canadian Government?"</p>

<p><i>Miss Royal: "Is</i> the Canadian Government making
reciprocity proposals? I never heard of them."</p>

<p>(Emily writes, "She never heard of them." Miss Royal refits her
pince-nez.)</p>

<p><i>Emily, thinks:</i> "With a chin and a nose like that you'll
look very witch-like when you grow old." <i>Says</i>: "Is it your
opinion that the historical novel has had its day?"</p>

<p><i>Miss Royal, languidly:</i> "I always leave my opinions at
home when I take a holiday."</p>

<p>(Emily writes, "She always leaves her opinions home when she
takes a holiday," and wishes savagely she could write her own
description of this interview, but knows Mr. Towers wouldn't print
it. Then consoles herself by remembering that she has a virgin
Jimmy-book at home and takes a wicked delight in thinking of the
account that will be written in it that night. Chu-Chin enters.
Emily wonders if he could have eaten the chicken in that short
time. Chu-Chin, evidently feeling the need of some desert, helps
himself to one of Mrs. Royal's crocheted tidies, crawls under the
piano with it and falls to chewing rapturously.)</p>

<p><i>Miss Royal, fervently: "Dear</i> dog!"</p>

<p><i>Emily, suddenly inspired:</i> "What do you think of chow
dogs?"</p>

<p><i>Miss Royal:</i> "The most adorable creatures in the
world."</p>

<p><i>Emily to herself:</i> "So you've brought <i>one</i> opinion
with you." <i>To Miss Royal: "I</i> do not admire them."</p>

<p><i>Miss Royal, with an icy smile:</i> "It is evident that your
taste in dogs must be quite different from mine."</p>

<p><i>Emily, to herself:</i> "I wish Ilse were here to call you
names for me."</p>

<p>(A large, motherly grey cat passes across the doorstep outside.
Chu-Chin bolts out from under the piano, shoots between the legs of
a tall plant stand, and pursues the flying cat. The plant stand has
gone over with a crash and Mrs. Royal's beautiful rex begonia lies
in ruins on the floor, amid a heap of earth and broken
pottery.)</p>

<p><i>Miss Royal, unsympathetically:</i> "Poor Aunt Angela! Her
heart will be broken."</p>

<p><i>Emily:</i> "But that doesn't matter, does it?"</p>

<p><i>Miss Royal, gently:</i> "Oh, no; not at all."</p>

<p><i>Emily, consulting note-book:</i> "Do you find many changes in
Shrewsbury?"</p>

<p><i>Miss Royal:</i> "I find a good many changes in the people.
The younger generation does not impress me favourably."</p>

<p>(Emily writes this down. Chu-Chin again reappears, evidently
having chased the cat through a fresh mud puddle, and resumes his
repast of the tidy, under the piano.)</p>

<p>Emily shut her note-book and rose. Not for any number of Mr.
Towers would she prolong this interview. She looked like a young
angel, but she was thinking terrible things. And she hated Miss
Royal&mdash;oh, how she hated her!</p>

<p>"Thank you, that will be all," she said, with a haughtiness
quite equal to Miss Royal's. "I'm sorry to have taken so much of
your time. Good-afternoon."</p>

<p>She bowed slightly and went out to the hall. Miss Royal followed
her to the parlour door.</p>

<p>"Hadn't you better take your dog, Miss Starr?" she asked
sweetly.</p>

<p>Emily paused in the act of shutting the outer door and looked at
Miss Royal.</p>

<p>"Pardon me."</p>

<p>"I said, hadn't you better take your dog?"</p>

<p>"My <i>dog?"</i></p>

<p>"Yes. He hasn't quite finished the tidy, to be sure, but you
might take it along. It won't be much good to Aunt Angela now."</p>

<p>"He&mdash;he&mdash;isn't <i>my</i> dog," gasped Emily.</p>

<p>"Not your dog? Whose dog is he then?" said Miss Royal.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I thought he was yours&mdash;your chow," said
Emily.</p>

<h2><a name="c23" id="c23"><i>An Open Door</i></a>
</h2>

<p>Miss Royal looked at Emily for a moment. Then she seized her
wrist, shut the door, drew her back to the parlour, and firmly
pushed her down into the morris chair. This done, Miss Royal threw
herself on the muddy davenport and began to laugh&mdash;long and
helplessly. Once or twice she rocked herself forward, gave Emily's
knee two wild whacks, then rocked back and continued to laugh.
Emily sat, smiling faintly. Her feelings had been too deeply
harrowed to permit of Miss Royal's convulsions of mirth, but
already there was glimmering in her mind a sketch for her
Jimmy-book. Meanwhile, the white dog, having chewed the tidy to
tatters, spied the cat again, and again rushed after her.</p>

<p>Finally Miss Royal sat erect and wiped her eyes.</p>

<p>"Oh, this is priceless, Emily Byrd Starr&mdash;priceless! When
I'm eighty I'll recall this and howl over it. Who will write it up,
you or I? But <i>who</i> does own that brute?"</p>

<p>"I'm sure I don't know," said Emily demurely. "I never saw him
in my life before."</p>

<p>"Well, let's shut the door before he can return. And now, dear
thing, sit here beside me&mdash;there's one clean spot here under
the cushion. We're going to have our real talk now. Oh, I was so
beastly to you when you were trying to ask me questions. I was
<i>trying</i> to be beastly. Why didn't you throw something at me,
you poor insulted darling?"</p>

<p>"I wanted to. But now I think you let me off very easily,
considering the behaviour of my supposed dog."</p>

<p>Miss Royal went off in another convulsion.</p>

<p>"I don't know if I can forgive you for thinking that horrid
curly white creature was my glorious red-gold chow. I'll take you
up to my room before you go and you shall apologize to him. He's
asleep on my bed. I locked him there to relieve dear Aunt Angela's
mind about her cat. Chu-Chin wouldn't hurt the cat&mdash;he merely
wants to play with her, and the foolish old thing runs. Now, you
know, when a cat runs, a dog simply can't help chasing her. As
Kipling tells us, he wouldn't be a proper dog if he didn't. If only
that white fiend had confined himself to chasing the cat!"</p>

<p>"It is too bad about Mrs. Royal's begonia," said Emily,
regretfully.</p>

<p>"Yes, that <i>is</i> a pity. Aunt Angela's had it for years. But
I'll get her a new one. When I saw you coming up the walk with that
dog frisking around you, of course I concluded he was yours. I had
put on my favourite dress because it really makes me look almost
beautiful&mdash;and I wanted you to love me; and when the beast
muddied it all over and you never said a word of rebuke or apology,
I simply went into one of my cold rages. I <i>do</i> go into
them&mdash;I can't help it. It's one of my little faults. But I
soon thaw out if no fresh aggravation occurs. In this case fresh
aggravation occurred every minute. I vowed to myself that if you
did not even try to make your dog behave I would not suggest that
you should. And I suppose <i>you</i> were indignant because I
calmly let <i>my</i> dog spoil your violets and eat your
manuscripts?"</p>

<p>"I was."</p>

<p>"It's too bad about the manuscripts. Perhaps we can find
them&mdash;he can't really have swallowed them, but I suppose he
has chewed them to bits."</p>

<p>"It doesn't matter. I have other copies at home."</p>

<p>"And your questions! Emily, you were too delicious. Did you
really write down my answers?"</p>

<p>"Word for word. I meant to print them just so, too. Mr. Towers
had given me a list of questions for you, but of course I didn't
mean to fire them off point-blank like that. I meant to weave them
artfully into our conversation as we went along. But here comes
Mrs. Royal."</p>

<p>Mrs. Royal came in, smiling. Her face changed as she saw the
begonia. But Miss Royal interposed quickly.</p>

<p>"Dearest Aunty, don't weep or faint&mdash;at least not before
you've told me who around here owns a white, curly, utterly
mannerless, devilish dog?"</p>

<p>"Lily Bates," said Mrs. Royal in a tone of despair. "Oh, has she
let that creature out again? I had a most terrible time with him
before you came. He's really just a big puppy and he <i>can't</i>
behave. I told her finally if I caught him over here again I'd
poison him. She's kept him shut up since then. But now&mdash;oh, my
lovely rex.</p>

<p>"Well, this dog came in with Emily. I supposed he was her dog.
Courtesy to a guest implies courtesy to her dog&mdash;isn't there
an old proverb that expresses it more concisely? He embraced me
fervently upon his entrance, as my dearest dress testifies. He
marked up your davenport&mdash;he tore off Emily's violets&mdash;he
chased your cat&mdash;he overturned your begonia&mdash;he broke
your vase&mdash;he ran off with our chicken&mdash;ay, groan, Aunt
Angela, he did!&mdash;and yet I, determinedly composed and
courteous, said not a word of protest. I vow my behaviour was
worthy of New Moon itself&mdash;wasn't it, Emily?"</p>

<p>"You were just too mad to speak," said Mrs. Royal ruefully,
fingering her wrecked begonia.</p>

<p>Miss Royal stole a sly glance at Emily.</p>

<p>"You see, I can't put anything over on Aunt Angela. She knows me
too well. I admit I was not my usual charming self. But, Aunty
darling, I'll get you a new vase and a new begonia&mdash;think of
all the fun you'll have coaxing it along. Anticipation is always so
much more interesting than realization."</p>

<p><i>"I</i>'ll settle Lily Bates," said Mrs. Royal, going out of
the room to look for a dustpan.</p>

<p>"Now, dear thing. Let's gab," said Miss Royal, snuggling down
beside Emily.</p>

<p><i>This</i> was the Miss Royal of the letter. Emily found no
difficulty in talking to <i>her.</i> They had a jolly hour and at
the end of it Miss Royal made a proposition that took away Emily's
breath.</p>

<p>"Emily, I want you to come back to New York with me in July.
There's a vacancy on the staff of <i>The Ladies' Own</i>&mdash;no
great thing in itself. You'll be sort of general handy-man, and all
odd jobs will be turned over to you&mdash;but you'll have a chance
to work up. And you'll be in the centre of things. You can
write&mdash;I, realized that the moment I read <i>The Woman Who
Spanked the King.</i> I know the editor of <i>Roche's</i> and I
found out who you were and where you lived. That's really why I
came down this spring&mdash;I wanted to get hold of you. You
mustn't waste your life here&mdash;it would be a crime. Oh, of
course, I know New Moon is a dear, quaint, lovely spot&mdash;full
of poetry and steeped in romance, it was just the place for you to
spend your childhood in. But you must have a chance to grow and
develop and be yourself. You must have the stimulus of association
with great minds&mdash;the training that only a great city can
give. Come with me. If you do, I promise you that in ten years'
time Emily Byrd Starr will be a name to conjure with among the
magazines of America."</p>

<p>Emily sat in a maze of bewilderment, too confused and dazzled to
think clearly. She had never dreamed of this. It was as if Miss
Royal had suddenly put into her hand a key to unlock the door into
the world of all her dreams, and hopes, and imaginings. Beyond that
door was all she had ever hoped for of success and fame. And
yet&mdash;and yet&mdash;what faint, odd, resentment stirred at the
back of all her whirling sensations? Was there a sting in Miss
Royal's calm assumption that if Emily did <i>not</i> go with her
her name would forever remain unknown? Did the old dead-and-gone
Murrays turn over in their graves at the whisper that one of their
descendants could never succeed without the help and "pull" of a
stranger? Or <i>had</i> Miss Royal's manner been a shade too
patronizing? Whatever it was it kept Emily from figuratively
flinging herself at Miss Royal's feet.</p>

<p>"Oh, Miss Royal, that would be wonderful," she faltered. "I'd
love to go&mdash;but I'm afraid Aunt Elizabeth will never consent.
She'll say I'm too young."</p>

<p>"How old <i>are</i> you?"</p>

<p>"Seventeen."</p>

<p>"I was eighteen when I went. I didn't know a soul in New
York&mdash;I had just enough money to keep me for three months. I
was a crude, callow little thing&mdash;yet I won out. <i>You</i>
shall live with me. I'll look after you as well as Aunt Elizabeth
herself could do. Tell her I'll guard you like the apple of my eye.
I have a dear, cozy, little flat where we'll be as happy as queens,
with my adored and adorable Chu-Chin. You'll love Chu-Chin,
Emily."</p>

<p>"I think I'd like a cat better," said Emily firmly.</p>

<p>"Cats! Oh, we couldn't have a cat in a flat. It wouldn't be
amenable enough to discipline. You must sacrifice your pussies on
the altar of your art. I'm sure you'll like living with me. I'm
<i>very</i> kind and amiable, dearest, when I feel like
it&mdash;and I generally do feel like it&mdash;and I <i>never</i>
lose my temper. It freezes up occasionally, but, as I told you, it
thaws quickly. I bear other people's misfortunes with equanimity.
And I <i>never</i> tell any one she has a cold or that she looks
tired. Oh, I'd really make an adorable housemate."</p>

<p>"I'm sure you would," said Emily, smiling.</p>

<p>"I never saw a young girl before that I wanted to live with,"
said Miss Royal. "You have a sort of luminous personality, Emily.
You'll give off light in dull places and empurple drab spots. Now,
<i>do</i> make up your mind to come with me."</p>

<p>"It is Aunt Elizabeth's mind that must be made up," said Emily
ruefully. "If she says I can go I'll&mdash;"</p>

<p>Emily found herself stopping suddenly.</p>

<p>"Go," finished Miss Royal joyfully. "Aunt Elizabeth will come
around. I'll go and have a talk with her. I'll go out to New Moon
with you next Friday night. You <i>must</i> have your chance."</p>

<p>"I can't thank you enough, Miss Royal, so I won't try. But I
must go now. I'll think this all over&mdash;I'm too dazzled just
now to think at all. You don't know what this means to me."</p>

<p>"I think I do," said Miss Royal gently. "I was once a young girl
in Shrewsbury, eating my heart out because I had no chance."</p>

<p>"But you made your own chance&mdash;and won out," said Emily
wistfully.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;but I had to go away to do it. I could never have got
anywhere here. And it was a horribly hard climb at first. It took
my youth. I want to save you some of the hardships and
discouragements. You will go far beyond what I have done&mdash;you
can create&mdash;I can only build with the materials others have
made. But we builders have our place&mdash;we can make temples for
our gods and goddesses if nothing else. Come with me, dear Girl
Emily, and I will do all I can to help you in every way."</p>

<p>"Thank you&mdash;thank you," was all Emily could say. Tears of
gratitude for this offer of ungrudging help and sympathy were in
her eyes. She had not received too much of sympathy or
encouragement in her life. It touched her deeply. She went away
feeling that she <i>must</i> turn the key and open the magic door
beyond which now seemed to lie all the beauty and allurement of
life&mdash;if only Aunt Elizabeth would let her.</p>

<p>"I can't do it if she doesn't approve," decided Emily.</p>

<p>Half-way home she suddenly stopped and laughed. After all, Miss
Royal had forgotten to show her Chu-Chin.</p>

<p>"But it doesn't matter," she thought, "because in the first
place I can't believe that, after this, I'll ever feel any real
interest in chow dogs. And in the second place I'll see him often
enough if I go to New York with Miss Royal."</p>

<h2><a name="c24" id="c24"><i>A Valley of Vision</i></a>
</h2>

<p>Would she go to New York with Miss Royal?</p>

<p>That was the question Emily had now to answer. Or rather, the
question Aunt Elizabeth must answer. For on Aunt Elizabeth's
answer, as Emily felt, everything depended. And she had no real
hope that Aunt Elizabeth would let her go. Emily might look
longingly towards those pleasant, far-off, green pastures pictured
by Miss Royal, but she was quite sure she could never browse in
them. The Murray pride&mdash;and prejudice&mdash;would be an
impassable barrier.</p>

<p>Emily said nothing to Aunt Ruth about Miss Royal's offer. It was
Aunt Elizabeth's due to hear it first. She kept her dazzling secret
until the next week-end, when Miss Royal came to New Moon, very
gracious and pleasant, and the wee-est bit patronizing, to ask Aunt
Elizabeth to let Emily go with her.</p>

<p>Aunt Elizabeth listened in silence&mdash;a disapproving silence,
as Emily felt.</p>

<p>"The Murray women have never had to work out for their living,"
she said coldly.</p>

<p>"It isn't exactly what you would call 'working out,' dear Miss
Murray," said Miss Royal, with the courteous patience one must use
to a lady whose viewpoint was that of an outlived generation.
"Thousands of women are going into business and professional life,
everywhere."</p>

<p>"I suppose it's all right for them if they don't get married,"
said Aunt Elizabeth.</p>

<p>Miss Royal flushed slightly. She knew that in Blair Water and
Shrewsbury she was regarded as an old maid, and therefore a
failure, no matter what her income and her standing might be in New
York. But she kept her temper and tried another line of attack.</p>

<p>"Emily has an unusual gift for writing," she said. "I think she
can do something really worth while if she gets a chance. She ought
to have her chance, Miss Murray. You know there isn't any chance
for that kind of work here."</p>

<p>"Emily has made ninety dollars this past year with her pen,"
said Aunt Elizabeth.</p>

<p>"Heaven grant me patience!" thought Miss Royal. Said Miss
Royal,</p>

<p>"Yes, and ten years from now she may be making a few hundreds;
whereas, if she comes with me, in ten years' time her income would
probably be as many thousands."</p>

<p>"I'll have to think it over," said Aunt Elizabeth.</p>

<p>Emily felt surprised that Aunt Elizabeth had even consented to
think it over. She had expected absolute refusal.</p>

<p>"She'll come round to it," whispered Miss Royal, when she went
away. "I'm going to get you, darling Emily B. I know the Murrays of
old. They always had an eye to the main chance. Aunty will let you
come."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid not," said Emily ruefully.</p>

<p>When Miss Royal had gone Aunt Elizabeth looked at Emily.</p>

<p>"Would you like to go, Emily?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I think so&mdash;if you don't mind," faltered Emily.
She was very pale&mdash;she did not plead or coax. But she had no
hope&mdash;none.</p>

<p>Aunt Elizabeth took a week to think it over. She called in Ruth
and Wallace and Oliver to help her. Ruth said dubiously,</p>

<p>"I suppose we ought to let her go. It's a splendid chance for
her. It's not as if she were going alone&mdash;I'd never agree to
that. Janet will look after her."</p>

<p>"She's too young&mdash;she's too young," said Uncle Oliver.</p>

<p>"It seems a good chance for her&mdash;Janet Royal has done well,
they say," said Uncle Wallace.</p>

<p>Aunt Elizabeth even wrote to Great-aunt Nancy. The answer came
back in Aunt Nancy's quavering hand:</p>

<p>"Suppose you let Emily decide for herself," suggested Aunt
Nancy.</p>

<p>Aunt Elizabeth folded up Aunt Nancy's letter and called Emily
into the parlour.</p>

<p>"If you wish to go with Miss Royal you may," she said. "I feel
it would not be right for me to hinder you. We shall miss
you&mdash;we would rather have you with us for a few years yet. I
know nothing about New York. I am told it is a wicked city. But you
have been brought up carefully. I leave the decision in your own
hands. Laura, what are you crying about?"</p>

<p>Emily felt as if she wanted to cry herself. To her amazement she
felt something that was <i>not</i> delight or pleasure. It was one
thing to long after forbidden pastures. It seemed to be quite
another thing when the bars were flung down and you were told to
enter if you would.</p>

<p>Emily did not immediately rush to her room and write a joyous
letter to Miss Royal&mdash;who was visiting friends in
Charlottetown. Instead she went out into the garden and thought
very hard&mdash;all that afternoon and all Sunday. During the
week-end in Shrewsbury she was quiet and thoughtful, conscious that
Aunt Ruth was watching her closely. For some reason Aunt Ruth did
not discuss the matter with her. Perhaps she was thinking of
Andrew. Or perhaps it was an understood thing among the Murrays
that Emily's decision was to be entirely uninfluenced.</p>

<p>Emily couldn't understand why she didn't write Miss Royal at
once. Of course she would go. Wouldn't it be terribly foolish not
to? She would never have such a chance again. It <i>was</i> such a
splendid chance&mdash;everything made easy&mdash;the Alpine Path no
more than a smooth and gentle slope&mdash;success certain and
brilliant and quick. Why, then, did she have to keep telling
herself all this&mdash;why was she driven to seek Mr. Carpenter's
advice the next week-end? And Mr. Carpenter would not help her very
much. He was rheumatic and cranky.</p>

<p>"Don't tell me the cats have been hunting again," he
groaned.</p>

<p>"No. I haven't any manuscripts this time," said Emily, with a
faint smile. "I've come for advice of a different kind."</p>

<p>She told him of her perplexity.</p>

<p>"It's such a splendid chance," she concluded.</p>

<p>"Of course it's a splendid chance&mdash;to go and be
Yankeefied," grunted Mr. Carpenter.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't get Yankeefied," said Emily resentfully. "Miss Royal
has been twenty years in New York and she isn't Yankeefied."</p>

<p>"Isn't she? I don't mean by Yankeefied what you think I do,"
retorted Mr. Carpenter. "I'm not referring to the silly girls who
go up to "the States" to work and come back in six months with an
accent that would raise blisters on your skin. Janet Royal
<i>is</i> Yankeefied&mdash;her outlook and atmosphere and style are
all U. S. And I'm not condemning them&mdash;they're all right.
But&mdash;she isn't a Canadian any longer&mdash;and that's what I
wanted you to be&mdash;pure Canadian through and through, doing
something as far as in you lay for the literature of your own
country, keeping your Canadian tang and flavour. But of course
there's not many dollars in that sort of thing yet."</p>

<p>"There's no chance to do <i>anything</i> here," argued
Emily.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;no more than there was in Haworth Parsonage," growled
Mr. Carpenter.</p>

<p>"I'm not a Charlotte Bronte," protested Emily. "She had
genius&mdash;it can stand alone. I have only talent&mdash;it needs
help&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;guidance."</p>

<p>"In short, pull," said Mr. Carpenter.</p>

<p>"So you think I oughtn't to go," said Emily anxiously.</p>

<p>"Go if you want to. To be quickly famous we must all stoop a
little. Oh, go&mdash;go&mdash;I'm telling you. I'm too old to
argue&mdash;go in peace. You'd be a fool not
to&mdash;only&mdash;fools do sometimes attain. There's a special
Providence for them, no doubt."</p>

<p>Emily went away from the little house in the hollow with her
eyes rather black. She met Old Kelly on her way up the hill and he
pulled his plump nag and red chariot to a standstill and beckoned
to her.</p>

<p>"Gurrl dear, here's some peppermints for you. And now, ain't it
high time&mdash;eh&mdash;now, you know&mdash;" Old Kelly winked at
her.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm going to be an old maid, Mr. Kelly," smiled Emily.</p>

<p>Old Kelly shook his head as he gathered up his reins.</p>

<p>"Shure an' nothing like that will ever be happening to you.
You're one av the folks God really loves&mdash;only don't be taking
one av the Prastes now&mdash;never one av the Prastes, gurrl
dear."</p>

<p>"Mr. Kelly," said Emily suddenly, "I've been offered a splendid
chance&mdash;to go to New York and take a place on the staff of a
magazine. I can't make up my mind. What do you think I'd better
do?"</p>

<p>As she spoke she thought of the horror of Aunt Elizabeth at the
idea of a Murray asking Old Jock Kelly's advice. She herself was a
little ashamed of doing it.</p>

<p>Old Kelly shook his head again.</p>

<p>"What do the b'ys around here be thinking av? But what does the
ould lady say?"</p>

<p>"Aunt Elizabeth says I can do as I like."</p>

<p>"Then I guess we'll be laving it at that," said Old
Kelly&mdash;and drove off without another word. Plainly there was
no help to be had in Old Kelly.</p>

<p>"Why should I want help?" thought Emily desperately. "What has
got into me that I can't make up my own mind? Why can't I
<i>say</i> I'll go? It doesn't seem to me now that I <i>want</i> to
go&mdash;I only feel I <i>ought</i> to want to go."</p>

<p>She wished that Dean were home. But Dean had not got back from
his winter in Los Angeles. And somehow she could not talk the
matter over with Teddy. Nothing had come of that wonderful moment
in the old John house&mdash;nothing except a certain constraint
that had almost spoiled their old comradeship. Outwardly they were
as good friends as ever; but something was gone&mdash;and nothing
seemed to be taking its place. She would not admit to herself that
she was afraid to ask Teddy. Suppose he told her to go? That would
hurt unbearably&mdash;because it would show that he didn't care
whether she went or stayed. But Emily would not glance at this at
all.</p>

<p>"Of course I'll go," she said aloud to herself. Perhaps the
spoken word would settle things. "What would I do next year if I
didn't? Aunt Elizabeth will certainly never let me go anywhere else
alone. Ilse will be away&mdash;and Perry&mdash;Teddy too, likely.
He says he's bound to go and do something to earn money for his art
study. I <i>must</i> go."</p>

<p>She said it fiercely, as if arguing against some invisible
opponent. When she reached home in the twilight, no one was there
and she went restlessly all over the house. What charm and dignity
and fineness the old rooms had, with their candles and their
ladder-backed chairs and their braided rugs! How dear and
entreating was her own little room with its diamond paper and its
guardian angel, its fat black rose-jar and its funny, kinky
window-pane! Would Miss Royal's flat be half so wonderful?"</p>

<p>"Of course I'll go," she said again&mdash;feeling that if she
could only have left off the "of course" the thing <i>would</i>
have been settled.</p>

<p>She went out into the garden, lying in the remote, passionless
beauty of early spring moonlight, and walked up and down its paths.
From afar came the whistle of the Shrewsbury train&mdash;like a
call from the alluring world beyond&mdash;a world full of interest,
charm, drama. She paused by the old lichened sun-dial and traced
the motto on its border, "So goes Time by." Time did go
by&mdash;swiftly, mercilessly, even at New Moon, unspoiled as it
was by any haste or rush of modernity. Should she not take the
current when it offered? The white June lilies waved in the faint
breeze&mdash;she could almost see her old friend the Wind-Woman
bending over them to tilt their waxen chins. Would the Wind Woman
come to her in the crowded city streets? Could she be like
Kipling's cat there?</p>

<p>"And I wonder if I'll ever have the flash in New York," she
thought wistfully.</p>

<p>How beautiful was this old garden which Cousin Jimmy loved! How
beautiful was old New Moon farm! Its beauty had a subtly romantic
quality all its own. There was enchantment in the curve of the
dark-red, dew-wet road beyond&mdash;remote, spiritual allurement in
the Three Princesses&mdash;magic in the orchard&mdash;a hint of
intriguing devilment in the fir wood. How could she leave this old
house that had sheltered and loved her&mdash;never tell me houses
do not love!&mdash;the graves of her kin by the Blair Water pond,
the wide fields and haunted woods where her childhood dreams had
been dreamed? All at once she knew she could not leave
them&mdash;she knew she had never really wanted to leave them.
<i>That</i> was why she had gone about desperately asking advice of
impossible outsiders. She had really been hoping they would tell
her not to go. That was why she had wished so wildly that Dean were
home&mdash;he would certainly have told her not to go.</p>

<p>"I belong to New Moon&mdash;I stay among my own people," she
said.</p>

<p>There was no doubt about this decision&mdash;she did not want
any one to help her to it. A deep, inner contentment possessed her
as she went up the walk and into the old house which no longer
looked reproachfully at her. She found Elizabeth and Laura and
Cousin Jimmy in the kitchen full of its candle magic.</p>

<p>"I am not going to New York, Aunt Elizabeth," she said. "I am
going to stay here at New Moon with you."</p>

<p>Aunt Laura gave a little cry of joy. Cousin Jimmy said,
"Hurrah!" Aunt Elizabeth knitted a round of her stocking before she
said anything. Then&mdash;</p>

<p>"I thought a Murray would," she said.</p>

<p>Emily went straight to Ashburn Monday evening. Miss Royal had
returned and greeted her warmly.</p>

<p>"I hope you've come to tell me that Miss Murray has decided to
be reasonable and let you come with me, honey-sweet."</p>

<p>"She told me I could decide for myself."</p>

<p>Miss Royal clapped her hands.</p>

<p>"Oh, goody, goody! Then it's all settled."</p>

<p>Emily was pale, but her eyes were black with earnestness and
intense feeling.</p>

<p>"Yes, it's settled&mdash;I'm not going," she said. "I thank you
with all my heart, Miss Royal, but I can't go."</p>

<p>Miss Royal stared at her&mdash;realized in a moment that it was
not the slightest use to plead or argue&mdash;but began to plead
and argue all the same.</p>

<p>"Emily&mdash;you can't mean it? Why can't you come?"</p>

<p>"I can't leave New Moon&mdash;I love it too much&mdash;it means
too much to me."</p>

<p>"I thought you wanted to come with me, Emily," said Miss Royal
reproachfully.</p>

<p>"I did. And part of me wants to yet. But away down under that
another part of me will not go. Don't think me foolish and
ungrateful, Miss Royal."</p>

<p>"Of course I don't think you're ungrateful," said Miss Royal,
helplessly, "but I do&mdash;yes, I do think you are awfully
foolish. You are simply throwing away your chances of a career.
What can you ever do here that is worth while, child? You've no
idea of the difficulties in your path. You can't get material
here&mdash;there's no atmosphere&mdash;no&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'll create my own atmosphere," said Emily, with a trifle of
spirit. After all, she thought, Miss Royal's viewpoint was the just
the same as Mrs. Alec Sawyer's, and her manner <i>was</i>
patronizing. "And as for material&mdash;people <i>live</i> here
just the same as anywhere else&mdash;suffer and enjoy and sin and
aspire just as they do in New York."</p>

<p>"You don't know a thing about it," said Miss Royal, rather
pettishly. "You'll never be able to write anything really worth
while here&mdash;no big thing. There's no inspiration&mdash;you'll
be hampered in every way&mdash;the big editors won't look farther
than the address of P. E. Island on your manuscript. Emily, you're
committing literary suicide. You'll realize that at three of the
clock some white night, Emily B. Oh, I suppose, after some years
you'll work up a clientele of Sunday-school and agricultural
papers. But will that satisfy you? You know it won't. And then the
petty jealousy of these small prunes-and-prisms places&mdash;if you
do anything the people you went to school with can't do some of
them will never forgive you. And they'll all think you're the
heroine of your own stories&mdash;especially if you portray her
beautiful and charming. If you write a love story they'll be sure
it's your own. You'll get so tired of Blair Water&mdash;you'll know
all the people in it&mdash;what they are and can be&mdash;it'll be
like reading a book for the twentieth time. Oh, I know all about
it. 'I was alive before you were borned,' as I said when I was
eight, to a playmate of six. You'll get discouraged&mdash;the hour
of three o'clock will gradually overwhelm you&mdash;there's a three
o'clock every night, remember&mdash;you'll give up&mdash;you'll
marry that cousin of yours&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never."</p>

<p>"Well, some one like him, then, and 'settle down'&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, I'll never 'settle down,'" said Emily decidedly. "Never as
long as I live&mdash;what a stodgy condition!"</p>

<p>&mdash;"and you'll have a parlour like this of Aunt Angela's,"
continued Miss Royal relentlessly. "A mantelpiece crowded with
photographs&mdash;an easel with an 'enlarged' picture in a frame
eight inches wide&mdash;a red plush album with a crocheted doily on
it, a crazy-quilt on your spare-room bed&mdash;a hand-painted
banner in your hall&mdash;and, as a final touch of elegance, an
asparagus fern will 'grace the centre of your dining-room
table.'"</p>

<p>"No," said Emily gravely, "such things are not among the Murray
traditions."</p>

<p>"Well, the spiritual equivalent of them, then. Oh, I can see
your whole life, Emily, here in a place like this where people
can't see a mile beyond their nose."</p>

<p>"I can see farther than that," said Emily, putting up her chin.
"I can see to the stars."</p>

<p>"I was speaking figuratively, my dear."</p>

<p>"So was I. Oh, Miss Royal, I know life is rather cramped here in
some ways&mdash;but the sky is as much mine as anybody's. I may not
succeed here&mdash;but, if not, I wouldn't succeed in New York
either. Some fountain of living water would dry up in my soul if I
left the land I love. I know I'll have difficulties and
discouragements here, but people have overcome far worse. You know
that story you told me about Parkman&mdash;that for years he was
unable to write for more than five minutes at a time&mdash;that he
took three years to write one of his books&mdash;six lines per day
for three years. I shall always remember that when I get
discouraged. It will help me through any number of white
nights."</p>

<p>"Well"&mdash;Miss Royal threw out her hands&mdash;"I give up. I
think you're making a terrible mistake, Emily&mdash;but if in the
years to come I find out I'm wrong I'll write and admit it. And if
<i>you</i> find out you were wrong write me and admit it, and
you'll find me as ready to help you as ever. I won't even say 'I
told you so.' Send me any of your stories my magazine is fit for,
and ask me for any advice I can give. I'm going right back to New
York to-morrow. I was only going to wait till July to take you with
me. Since you won't come I'm off. I detest living in a place where
all they think is that I've played my cards badly, and lost the
matrimonial game&mdash;where all the young girls&mdash;except
<i>you</i>&mdash;are so abominably respectful to me&mdash;and where
the old folks keep telling me I look so much like my mother. Mother
was <i>ugly.</i> Let's say good-bye and make it snappy."</p>

<p>"Miss Royal," said Emily earnestly, "you do believe&mdash;don't
you&mdash;that I appreciate your kindness? Your sympathy and
encouragement have meant more to me&mdash;always will mean more to
me than you can ever dream."</p>

<p>Miss Royal whisked her handkerchief furtively across her eyes
and made an elaborate curtsey.</p>

<p>"Thank you for them kind words, lady," she said solemnly.</p>

<p>Then she laughed a little, put her hands on Emily's shoulders
and kissed her cheek.</p>

<p>"All the good wishes ever thought, said, or written go with
you," she said. "And I think it would be&mdash;nice&mdash;if any
place could ever mean to me what it is evident New Moon means to
you."</p>

<p>At three o'clock that night a wakeful but contented Emily
remembered that she had never seen Chu-Chin.</p>

<h2><a name="c25" id="c25"><i>April Love</i></a>

<p>"I'm glad it's over. I've felt it coming for some time. Every

<p>"Yesterday evening I went to the Land of Uprightness for one of
the last rambles I shall have in it. I climbed the hill of firs and
looked down over the fields of mist and silver in the moonlight.
The shadows of the ferns and sweet wild grasses along the edge of
the woods were like a dance of sprites. Away beyond the harbour,
below the moonlight, was a sky of purple and amber where a sunset
had been. But behind me was darkness&mdash;a darkness which, with
its tang of fir balsam, was like a perfumed chamber where one might
dream dreams and see visions. Always when I go into the Land of
Uprightness I leave behind the realm of daylight and things known
and go into the realm of shadow and mystery and enchantment where
anything might happen&mdash;anything might come true. I can
<i>believe</i> anything there&mdash;old
myths&mdash;legends&mdash;dryads&mdash;fauns&mdash;leprechauns. One
of my wonder moments came to me&mdash;it seemed to me that I got
out of my body and was <i>free</i>&mdash;I'm sure I heard an echo
of that 'random word' of the gods&mdash;and I wanted some unused
language to express what I saw and felt.</p>

<p>"Enter Andrew, spic and span, prim and gentlemanly.</p>

<p>"Fauns&mdash;fairies&mdash;wonder moments&mdash;random
words&mdash;fled pell-mell. No new language was needed now.</p>

<p>"'What a pity side-whiskers went out with the last
generation&mdash;they would suit him so,' I said to myself in good
plain English.</p>

<p>"I knew Andrew had come to say something special. Otherwise he
would not have followed me into the Land of Uprightness, but have
waited decorously in Aunt Ruth's parlour. I knew it had to come and
I made up my mind to get it over and have done with it. The
expectant attitude of Aunt Ruth and the New Moon folks has been
oppressive lately. I believe they all feel quite sure that the real
reason I wouldn't go to New York was that I couldn't bear to part
with Andrew!</p>

<p>"But I was <i>not</i> going to have Andrew propose to me by
moonlight in the Land of Uprightness. I might have been bewitched
into accepting him. So when he said, 'It's nice here, let's stay
here for a while&mdash;after all, I think there is nothing so
pretty as nature,' I said gently but firmly that, though nature
must feel highly flattered, it was too damp for a person with a
tendency to consumption, and I must go in.</p>

<p>"In we went. I sat down opposite Andrew and stared at a bit of
Aunt Ruth's crochet yarn on the carpet. I shall remember the colour
and shape of that yarn to my dying day. Andrew talked jerkily about
indifferent things and then began throwing out hints&mdash;he would
get his managership in two years more&mdash;he believed in people
marrying young&mdash;and, so on. He floundered badly. I suppose I
could have made it easier for him but I hardened my heart,
remembering how he had kept away in those dreadful weeks of the
John house scandal. At last he blurted out,</p>

<p>"'Emily, let's get married when&mdash;when&mdash;as soon as I'm
able to.'</p>

<p>"He seemed to feel that he ought to say something more but
didn't know just what&mdash;so he repeated 'just as soon as I'm
able to' and stopped.</p>

<p>"I don't believe I even went through the motions of a blush.</p>

<p>"'Why should we get married?' I said.</p>

<p>"Andrew looked aghast. Evidently this was not the Murray
tradition of receiving a proposal.</p>

<p>"'Why? Why? Because&mdash;I'd like it,' he stammered.</p>

<p>"'<i>I</i> wouldn't,' I said.</p>

<p>"Andrew stared at me for a few moments trying to take in the
amazing idea that he was being refused.</p>

<p>"'But <i>why?'</i> he asked&mdash;exactly in Aunt Ruth's tone
and manner.</p>

<p>"'Because I don't love you,' I said.</p>

<p>"Andrew <i>did</i> blush. I know he thought I was immodest.</p>

<p>"'I&mdash;I&mdash;think&mdash;they'd all like it,' he
stammered.</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> wouldn't,' I said again. I said it in a tone even
Andrew couldn't mistake.</p>

<p>"He was so surprised I don't think he felt anything <i>but</i>
surprise&mdash;not even disappointment. He didn't know what to do
or say&mdash;a <i>Murray</i> couldn't coax&mdash;so he got up and
went out without another word. I thought he banged the door but
afterwards I discovered it was only the wind. I wish he <i>had</i>
banged the door. It would have saved my self-respect. It is
mortifying to refuse a man and then discover that his main feeling
is bewilderment.</p>

<p>"Next morning Aunt Ruth, evidently suspecting something amiss
from the brevity of Andrew's call, asked me point blank what had
happened. There's nothing subtle about Aunt Ruth. I told her just
as point blankly.</p>

<p>"'What fault have you to find with Andrew?' she asked icily.</p>

<p>"'No fault&mdash;but he tastes flat. He has all the virtues but
the pinch of salt was left out,' I said, with my nose in the
air.</p>

<p>"'I hope you don't go farther and fare worse,' said Aunt Ruth
ominously&mdash;meaning, as I knew, Stovepipe Town. I could have
reassured Aunt Ruth on that point, also, had I chosen. Last week
Perry came to tell me that he is going into Mr. Abel's office in
Charlottetown to study law. It's a splendid chance for him. Mr.
Abel heard his speech the night of the inter-school debate and has
had his eye on him ever since, I understand. I congratulated him
heartily. I really was delighted.</p>

<p>"'He'll give me enough to pay my board,' said Perry, 'and I
guess I can rustle my clothes on some side line. I've got to hoe my
own row. Aunt Tom won't help me. <i>You</i> know why.'</p>

<p>"'I'm sorry, Perry,' I said, laughing a little.</p>

<p>"'<i>Won't</i> you, Emily?' he said. 'I'd like this thing
settled.'</p>

<p>"'It is settled,' I said.</p>

<p>"'I suppose I've made an awful ass of myself about you,'
grumbled Perry.</p>

<p>"'You have,' I said comfortingly&mdash;but still laughingly.
Somehow I've never been able to take Perry seriously any more than
Andrew. I've always got the feeling that he just imagines he's in
love with me.</p>

<p>"'You won't get a cleverer man than me in a hurry,' warned
Perry. 'I'm going to climb high.'</p>

<p>"'I'm sure you will,' I said warmly, 'and nobody will be more
pleased than your friend, Emily B.'</p>

<p>"'Oh, <i>friends,'</i> said Perry sulkily. 'It's not for a
friend I want you. But I've always heard it was no use to coax a
Murray. Will you tell me one thing? It isn't my funeral&mdash;but
are you going to marry Andrew Murray?'</p>

<p>"'It isn't your funeral&mdash;but I'm <i>not,'</i> I said.</p>

<p>"'Well,' said Perry, as he went out, 'if you ever change your
mind, let me know. It will be all right&mdash;if I haven't changed
mine.'</p>

<p>"I have written the account of this exactly as it happened.
But&mdash;I have also written another account of it in my
Jimmy-book as it <i>should</i> have happened. I find I am beginning
to overcome my old difficulty of getting my dream people to make
love fluently. In my imaginary account both Perry and I talked
bee-yew-tifully.</p>

<p>"I think Perry really felt a little worse than Andrew did, and I
felt sorry about it. I do like Perry so much as a chum and friend.
I hate to disappoint him, but I know he will soon get over it.</p>

<p>"So I'll be the only one left at Blair Water next year. I don't
know how I'll feel about that. I dare say I'll feel a little flat
by times&mdash;perhaps at three o' the night I'll wish I had gone
with Miss Royal. But I'm going to settle down to hard, serious
work. It's a long climb to the crest of the Alpine Path.</p>

<p>"But I believe in myself, and there is always my world behind
the curtain.</p>

<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

<p>"New Moon,</p>

<p>"June 21, 19&mdash;</p>

<p>"As soon as I arrived home to-night I felt a decided atmosphere
of disapproval, and realized that Aunt Elizabeth knew all about
Andrew. She was angry and Aunt Laura was sorry; but nobody has said
anything. At twilight I talked it over in the garden with Cousin
Jimmy. Andrew, it seems, <i>has</i> been feeling quite badly since
the numbness of shock wore off. His appetite has failed; and Aunt
Addie indignantly wants to know if I expect to marry a prince or a
millionaire since <i>her</i> son is not good enough for me.</p>

<p>"Cousin Jimmy thinks I did perfectly right. Cousin Jimmy would
think I had done perfectly right if I had murdered Andrew and
buried him in the Land of Uprightness. It's very nice to have
<i>one</i> friend like that, though too many wouldn't be good for
you.</p>

<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

<p>"June 22, 19&mdash;</p>

<p>"I don't know which is worse&mdash;to have somebody you
<i>don't</i> like ask you to marry him or <i>not</i> have some one
you <i>do</i> like. Both are rather unpleasant.</p>

<p>"I have decided that I only imagined certain things in the old
John house. I'm afraid Aunt Ruth was right when she used to say my
imagination needed a curb. This evening I loitered in the garden.
In spite of the fact that it was June it was cold and raw, and I
felt a little lonely and discouraged and flat&mdash;perhaps because
two stories of which I had hoped a good deal came back to me
to-day. Suddenly I heard Teddy's signal whistle in the old orchard.
Of course I went. It's always a case of 'Oh, whistle and I'll come
to you, my lad' with me&mdash;though I would die before I would
admit it to any one but my journal. As soon as I saw his face I
knew he had some great news.</p>

<p>"He had. He held out a letter, 'Mr. Frederick Kent.' I never can
remember that Teddy's name is Frederick&mdash;he can never be
anything but Teddy to me. He has won a scholarship at the School of
Design in Montreal&mdash;five hundred dollars for two years. I was
instantly as excited as he was&mdash;with a queer feeling behind
the excitement which was so compounded of fear and hope and
expectancy that I couldn't tell which predominated.</p>

<p>"'How splendid for you, Teddy!' I said, a little tremulously.
'Oh, I'm so glad! But your mother&mdash;what does she think of
it?'</p>

<p>"'She'll let me go&mdash;but she'll be very lonely and unhappy,'
said Teddy, growing very sober instantly. 'I want her to come with
me, but she won't leave the Tansy Patch. I hate to think of her
living there all alone. I&mdash;I wish she didn't feel as she does
about you, Emily. If she didn't&mdash;you could be such a comfort
to her.'</p>

<p>"I wondered if it occurred to Teddy that I might need a little
comforting too. A queer silence fell between us. We walked along
the To-morrow Road&mdash;it has grown so beautiful that one wonders
if any to-morrow can make it more beautiful&mdash;until we reached
the fence of the pond-pasture and stood there under the grey-green
gloom of the firs. I felt suddenly very happy and in those few
minutes part of me planted a garden and laid out beautiful closets
and bought a dozen solid silver teaspoons and arranged my attic and
hemstitched a double damask table-cloth&mdash;and the other part of
me just <i>waited.</i> Once I said it was a lovely evening&mdash;it
wasn't&mdash;and a few minutes later I said it looked like
rain&mdash;it didn't.</p>

<p>"But one <i>had</i> to say something.</p>

<p>"'I'm going to work hard&mdash;I'm going to get everything
possible out of those two years,' Teddy said at last, staring at
Blair Water and at the sky and at the sandhills, and at the green
leisurely meadows, and at everything but me. 'Then, perhaps, when
they're up I'll manage to get to Paris. To go abroad&mdash;to see
the masterpieces of great artists&mdash;to live in their
atmosphere&mdash;to see the scenes their genius
immortalized&mdash;all I've been hungry for all my life. And when I
come back&mdash;'</p>

<p>"Teddy stopped abruptly and turned to me. From the look in his
eyes I thought he was going to kiss me&mdash;I really did. I don't
know what I would have done if I couldn't have shut my own
eyes.</p>

<p>'"And when I come back&mdash;' he repeated&mdash;stopped
again.</p>

<p>"'Yes?' I said. I don't deny to this my journal that I said it a
trifle expectantly.</p>

<p>"'I'll make the name of Frederick Kent mean something in
Canada!' said Teddy.</p>

<p>"I opened my eyes.</p>

<p>"Teddy was looking at the dim gold of Blair Water and scowling.
Again I had a feeling that night air was not good for me. I
shivered, said a few polite commonplaces, and left him there
scowling. I wonder if he was too shy to kiss me&mdash;or just
didn't want to.</p>

<p>"I <i>could</i> care tremendously for Teddy Kent if I let
myself&mdash;if he wanted me to. It is evident he doesn't want me
to. He is thinking of nothing but success and ambition and a
career. He has forgotten our exchange of glances in the old John
house&mdash;he has forgotten that he told me three years ago, on
George Horton's tombstone, that I was the sweetest girl in the
world. He will meet hundreds of wonderful girls out in the
world&mdash;he will never think of me again.</p>

<p>"So be it.</p>

<p>"If Teddy doesn't want me I won't want him. That is a Murray
tradition. But then I'm only half Murray. There is the Starr half
to be considered. Luckily <i>I</i> have a career and an ambition
also to think about, and a jealous goddess to serve, as Mr.
Carpenter once told me. I think she might not tolerate a divided
allegiance.</p>

<p>"I am conscious of three sensations.</p>

<p>"On top I am sternly composed and traditional.</p>

<p>"Underneath that, something that would hurt horribly if I let it
is being kept down.</p>

<p>"And underneath that again is a queer feeling of relief that I
still have my freedom.</p>

<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

<p>"June 26, 19&mdash;</p>

<p>"All Shrewsbury is laughing over Ilse's last exploit and half
Shrewsbury is disapproving. There is a certain very pompous young
Senior who acts as usher in St. John's Church on Sundays, who takes
himself very seriously and whom Ilse hates. Last Sunday she dressed
herself up as an old woman, borrowing the toggery from a poor
relation of Mrs. Adamson's who boards with her&mdash;a long, full,
black skirt, bordered with crape, a widow's bonnet, and a heavy
crape widow's veil. Arrayed thus, she tottered down the street and
paused wistfully at the church steps as if she couldn't possibly
climb them. Young Pomposity saw her, and, having some decent
instincts behind his pomposity, went gallantly to her assistance.
He took her shaking, mittened hand&mdash;it <i>was</i> shaking all
right&mdash;Ilse was in spasms of laughter behind her
veil&mdash;and assisted her frail, trembling feet up the steps,
through the porch, up the aisle and into a pew. Ilse murmured a
broken blessing on him, handed him a tract, sat through the service
and then tottered home. Next day, of course, the story was all
through the school and the poor lad was so guyed by the other boys
that all his pomposity oozed out&mdash;temporarily at
least&mdash;under the torture. Perhaps the incident may do him a
world of good.</p>

<p>"Of course I scolded Ilse. She is a glad, daring creature and
counts no cost. She will always do whatever she takes it into her
head to do, even if it were to turn a somersault in the church
aisle. I love her&mdash;love her&mdash;love her; and what I will do
without her next year I do not know. Our to-morrows will always be
separated after this&mdash;and grow apart&mdash;and when we meet
occasionally it will be as strangers. Oh, I know&mdash;I know.</p>

<p>"Ilse was furious over what she called Perry's 'presumption' in
thinking I could ever marry him.</p>

<p>"'Oh, it was not presumption&mdash;it was condescension,' I
said, laughing. 'Perry belongs to the great ducal house of
Carabas.'</p>

<p>"'Oh, he'll succeed, of course. But there'll always be a flavour
of Stovepipe Town about him,' retorted Ilse.</p>

<p>"'Why have you always been so hard on Perry, Ilse?' I
protested.</p>

<p>"'He's such a cackling oaf,' said Ilse morosely.</p>

<p>"'Oh, well, he's just at the age when a boy knows everything,' I
said, feeling quite wise and elderly. 'He will grow more ignorant
and endurable after a while,' I went on, feeling epigrammatic. 'And
he has improved in these Shrewsbury years,' I concluded, feeling
smug.</p>

<p>"'You talk as if he were a cabbage,' fumed Ilse. 'For heaven's
sake, Emily, don't be so superior and patronizing!'</p>

<p>"There are times when Ilse is good for me. I know I deserved
that.</p>

<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

<p>"June 27, 19&mdash;</p>

<p>"Last night I dreamed I stood in the old summer-house at New
Moon and saw the Lost Diamond sparkling on the floor at my feet. I
picked it up in delight. It lay in my hand for a moment&mdash;then
it seemed to elude my grasp, flash through the air, leaving a long,
slender trail of brilliance behind it, and become a star in the
western sky, just above the edge of the world. 'It is my
star&mdash;I must reach it before it sets,' I thought, and started
out. Suddenly Dean was beside me&mdash;and he, too, was following
the star. I felt I must go slowly because he was lame and could not
go fast&mdash;and all the time the star sank lower and lower. Yet I
felt I couldn't leave Dean. Then just as suddenly&mdash;things
<i>do</i> happen like that in dreams&mdash;so nice&mdash;without a
bit of trouble&mdash;Teddy was beside me, too, holding out his
hands to me, with the look in his eyes I had seen twice before. I
put my hands in his&mdash;and he drew me towards him&mdash;I was
holding up my face&mdash;then Dean gave a bitter cry, 'My star has
set.' I turned my head for just a glance&mdash;the star was
gone&mdash;and I woke up in a dull, ugly, rainy dawn with no
star&mdash;no Teddy&mdash;no kiss.</p>

<p>"I wonder what the dream meant&mdash;if it meant anything. I
must not think it did. It is a Murray tradition not to be
superstitious.</p>

<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

<p>"June 28, 19&mdash;</p>

<p>"This is my last night in Shrewsbury. 'Good-bye, proud world,
I'm going home'&mdash;to-morrow, when Cousin Jimmy is coming for me
and my trunk in the old express waggon and I will ride back in that
chariot of state to New Moon.</p>

<p>"These three Shrewsbury years seemed so long to me when I looked
ahead to them. And now, looking back, they seem as yesterday when
it has passed. I think I've won something in them. I don't use so
many italics&mdash;I've acquired a little poise and
self-control&mdash;I've got a bit of bitter worldly
wisdom&mdash;and I've learned to smile over a rejection slip. I
think that has been the hardest lesson of all to learn&mdash;and
doubtless the most necessary.</p>

<p>"As I look back over these three years some things stand out so
much more clearly and significantly than others, as if they had a
special meaning all their own. And not always the things one might
expect either. For instance, Evelyn's enmity and even that horrible
moustache incident seem faded and unimportant. But the moment I saw
my first poem in <i>Garden and Woodland</i>&mdash;oh, that
<i>was</i> a moment&mdash;my walk to New Moon and back the night of
the play&mdash;the writing of that queer little poem of mine that
Mr. Carpenter tore up&mdash;my night on the haystack under the
September moon&mdash;that splendid old woman who spanked the
King&mdash;the moment in class when I discovered Keats' lines about
the 'airy voices'&mdash;and that other moment in the old John house
when Teddy looked into my eyes&mdash;oh, it seems to me these are
the things I will remember in the halls of Eternity when Evelyn
Blake's sneers and the old John house scandal and Aunt Ruth's
nagging and the routine of lessons and examinations have been for
ever forgotten. And my promise to Aunt Elizabeth <i>has</i> helped
me, as Mr. Carpenter predicted. Not in my diary perhaps&mdash;I
just let myself <i>go</i> here&mdash;one must have a
'vent'&mdash;but in my stories and Jimmy-books.</p>

<p>"We had our class day exercises this afternoon. I wore my new
cream organdy with the violets in it and carried a big bouquet of
pink peonies. Dean, who is in Montreal on his way home, wired the
florist here for a bouquet of roses for me&mdash;seventeen
roses&mdash;one for each year of my life&mdash;and it was presented
to me when I went up for my diploma. That was dear of Dean.</p>

<p>"Perry was class orator and made a fine speech. And he got the
medal for general proficiency. It has been a stiff pull between him
and Will Morris, but Perry has won out.</p>

<p>"I wrote and read the class day prophecy. It was very amusing
and the audience seemed to enjoy it. I had another one in my
Jimmy-book at home. It was much <i>more</i> amusing but it wouldn't
have done to read it.</p>

<p>"I wrote my last society letter for Mr. Towers tonight. I've
always hated that stunt but I wanted the few pennies it brought in
and one mustn't scorn the base degrees by which one ascends young
ambition's ladder.</p>

<p>"I've also been packing up. Aunt Ruth came up occasionally and
looked at me as I packed but was oddly silent. Finally she said,
with a sigh,</p>

<p>"'I shall miss you awfully, Emily.'</p>

<p>"I never dreamed of her saying and feeling anything like that.
And it made me feel uncomfortable. Since Aunt Ruth was so decent
about the John house scandal I've felt differently towards her. But
I couldn't say I'd miss her.</p>

<p>"Yet something had to be said.</p>

<p>"'I shall always be very grateful to you, Aunt Ruth, for what
you have done for me these past three years.'</p>

<p>"'I've tried to do my duty,' said Aunt Ruth virtuously.</p>

<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

<p>"I find I'm oddly sorry to leave this little room I've never
liked and that has never liked me, and that long hill starred with
lights&mdash;after all, I've had some wonderful moments here. And
even poor dying Byron! But by no stretch of sentiment can I regret
parting from Queen Alexandra's chromo, or the vase of paper
flowers. Of course, the Lady Giovanna goes with me. She
<i>belongs</i> in my room at New Moon. She has always seemed like
an exile here. It hurts me to think I shall never again hear the
night wind in the Land of Uprightness. But I'll have my night wind
in Lofty John's bush; I think Aunt Elizabeth means to let me have a
kerosene lamp to write by&mdash;my door at New Moon shuts
<i>tight</i>&mdash;and I will not have to drink cambric tea. I went
at dusk to-night to that little pearly pool which has always been
such a witching spot to linger near on spring evenings. Through the
trees that fringed it faint hues of rose and saffron from the west
stole across it. It was unruffled by a breath and every leaf and
branch and fern and blade of grass was mirrored in it. I looked
in&mdash;and saw my face; and by an odd twist of reflection from a
bending bough I seemed to wear a leafy garland on my
head&mdash;like a laurel crown.</p>

<p>"I took it as a good omen.</p>

<p>"Perhaps Teddy was only shy!"</p>
