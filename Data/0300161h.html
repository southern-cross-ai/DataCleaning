<h3>I</h3>

<p>"No more cambric-tea" had Emily Byrd Starr written in her diary
when she came home to New Moon from Shrewsbury, with high school
days behind her and immortality before her.</p>

<p>Which was a symbol. When Aunt Elizabeth Murray permitted Emily
to drink real tea&mdash;as a matter of course and not as an
occasional concession&mdash;she thereby tacitly consented to let
Emily grow up. Emily had been considered grownup by other people
for some time, especially by Cousin Andrew Murray and Friend Perry
Miller, each of whom had asked her to marry him and been
disdainfully refused for his pains. When Aunt Elizabeth found this
out she knew it was no use to go on making Emily drink cambric-tea.
Though, even then, Emily had no real hope that she would ever be
permitted to wear silk stockings. A silk petticoat might be
tolerated, being a hidden thing, in spite of its seductive rustle,
but silk stockings were immoral.</p>

<p>So Emily, of whom it was whispered somewhat mysteriously by
people who knew her to people who didn't know her, "she
<i>writes</i>," was accepted as one of the ladies of New Moon,
where nothing had ever changed since her coming there seven years
before and where the carved ornament on the sideboard still cast
the same queer shadow of an Ethiopian silhouette on exactly the
same place on the wall where she had noticed it delightedly on her
first evening there. An old house that had lived its life long ago
and so was very quiet and wise and a little mysterious. Also a
little austere, but very kind. Some of the Blair Water and
Shrewsbury people thought it was a dull place and outlook for a
young girl and said she had been very foolish to refuse Miss
Royal's offer of "a position on a magazine" in New York. Throwing
away such a good chance to make something of herself! But Emily,
who had very clear-cut ideas of what she was going to make of
herself, did not think life would be dull at New Moon or that she
had lost her chance of Alpine climbing because she had elected to
stay there.</p>

<p>She belonged by right divine to the Ancient and Noble Order of
Story-tellers. Born thousands of years earlier she would have sat
in the circle around the fires of the tribe and enchanted her
listeners. Born in the foremost files of time she must reach her
audience through many artificial mediums.</p>

<p>But the materials of story weaving are the same in all ages and
all places. Births, deaths, marriages, scandals&mdash;these are the
only really interesting things in the world. So she settled down
very determinedly and happily to her pursuit of fame and
fortune&mdash;and of something that was neither. For writing, to
Emily Byrd Starr, was not primarily a matter of worldly lucre or
laurel crown. It was something she <i>had</i> to do. A
thing&mdash;an idea&mdash;whether of beauty or ugliness, tortured
her until it was "written out." Humorous and dramatic by instinct,
the comedy and tragedy of life enthralled her and demanded
expression through her pen. A world of lost but immortal dreams,
lying just beyond the drop-curtain of the real, called to her for
embodiment and interpretation&mdash;called with a voice she could
not&mdash;dared not&mdash;disobey.</p>

<p>She was filled with youth's joy in mere existence. Life was for
ever luring and beckoning her onward. She knew that a hard struggle
was before her; she knew that she must constantly offend Blair
Water neighbours who would want her to write obituaries for them
and who, if she used an unfamiliar word would say contemptuously
that she was "talking big;" she knew there would be rejection slips
galore; she knew there would be days when she would feel
despairingly that she could not write and that it was of no use to
try; days when the editorial phrase, "not necessarily a reflection
on its merits," would get on her nerves to such an extent that she
would feel like imitating Marie Bashkirtseff and hurling the
taunting, ticking, remorseless sitting-room clock out of the
window; days when everything she had done or tried to do would
slump&mdash;become mediocre and despicable; days when she would be
tempted to bitter disbelief in her fundamental conviction that
there was as much truth in the poetry of life as in the prose; days
when the echo of that "random word" of the gods, for which she so
avidly listened, would only seem to taunt her with its suggestions
of unattainable perfection and loveliness beyond the reach of
mortal ear or pen.</p>

<p>She knew that Aunt Elizabeth tolerated but never approved her
mania for scribbling. In her last two years in Shrewsbury High
School Emily, to Aunt Elizabeth's almost incredulous amazement, had
actually earned some money by her verses and stories. Hence the
toleration. But no Murray had ever done such a thing before. And
there was always that sense, which Dame Elizabeth Murray did not
like, of being shut out of something. Aunt Elizabeth really
resented the fact that Emily had another world, apart from the
world of New Moon and Blair Water, a kingdom starry and
illimitable, into which she could enter at will and into which not
even the most determined and suspicious of aunts could follow her.
I really think that if Emily's eyes had not so often seemed to be
looking at something dreamy and lovely and secretive Aunt Elizabeth
might have had more sympathy with her ambitions. None of us, not
even self-sufficing Murrays of New Moon, like to be barred out.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>Those of you who have already followed Emily through her years
of New Moon and Shrewsbury* must have a tolerable notion what she
looked like. For those of you to whom she comes as a stranger let
me draw a portrait of her as she seemed to the outward eye at the
enchanted portal of seventeen, walking where the golden
chrysanthemums lighted up an old autumnal, maritime garden. A place
of peace, that garden of New Moon. An enchanted pleasaunce, full of
rich, sensuous colours and wonderful spiritual shadows. Scents of
pine and rose were in it; boom of bees, threnody of wind, murmurs
of the blue Atlantic gulf; and always the soft sighing of the firs
in Lofty John Sullivan's "bush" to the north of it. Emily loved
every flower and shadow and sound in it, every beautiful old tree
in and around it, especially her own intimate, beloved
trees&mdash;a cluster of wild cherries in the south-west corner,
Three Princesses of Lombardy, a certain maiden-like wild plum on
the brook path, the big spruce in the centre of the garden, a
silver maple and a pine farther on, an aspen in another corner
always coquetting with gay little winds, and a whole row of stately
white birches in Lofty John's bush.</p>

<p>* See <i>Emily of New Moon</i> and <i>Emily Climbs.</i></p>

<p>Emily was always glad that she lived where there were many
trees&mdash;old ancestral trees, planted and tended by hands long
dead, bound up with everything of joy and sorrow that visited the
lives in their shadows.</p>

<p>A slender, virginal young thing. Hair like black silk.
Purplish-grey eyes, with violet shadows under them that always
seemed darker and more alluring after Emily had sat up to some
unholy and un-Elizabethan hour completing a story or working out
the skeleton of a plot; scarlet lips with a Murray-like crease at
the corners; ears with Puckish, slightly pointed tips. Perhaps it
was the crease and the ears that made certain people think her
something of a puss. An exquisite line of chin and neck; a smile
with a trick in it; such a slow-blossoming thing with a sudden
radiance of fulfilment. And ankles that scandalous old Aunt Nancy
Priest of Priest Pond commended. Faint stains of rose in her
rounded cheeks that sometimes suddenly deepened to crimson. Very
little could bring that transforming flush&mdash;a wind off the
sea, a sudden glimpse of blue upland, a flame-red poppy, white
sails going out of the harbour in the magic of morning, gulf-waters
silver under the moon, a Wedgwood-blue columbine in the old
orchard. Or a certain whistle in Lofty John's bush.</p>

<p>With all this&mdash;pretty? I cannot tell you. Emily was never
mentioned when Blair Water beauties were being tabulated. But no
one who looked upon her face ever forgot it. No one, meeting Emily
the second time ever had to say "Er&mdash;your face seems familiar
but&mdash;" Generations of lovely women were behind her. They had
all given her something of personality. She had the grace of
running water. Something, too, of its sparkle and limpidity. A
thought swayed her like a strong wind. An emotion shook her as a
tempest shakes a rose. She was one of those vital creatures of
whom, when they do die, we say it seems impossible that they can be
dead. Against the background of her practical, sensible clan she
shone like a diamond flame. Many people liked her, many disliked
her. No one was ever wholly indifferent to her.</p>

<p>Once, when Emily had been very small, living with her father
down in the little old house at Maywood, where he had died, she had
started out to seek the rainbow's end. Over long wet fields and
hills she ran, hopeful, expectant. But as she ran the wonderful
arch was faded&mdash;was dim&mdash;was gone. Emily was alone in an
alien valley, not too sure in which direction lay home. For a
moment her lips quivered, her eyes filled. Then she lifted her face
and smiled gallantly at the empty sky.</p>

<p>"There will be other rainbows," she said.</p>

<p>Emily was a chaser of rainbows.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>Life at New Moon had changed. She must adjust herself to it. A
certain loneliness must be reckoned with. Ilse Burnley, the madcap
pal of seven faithful years, had gone to the School of Literature
and Expression in Montreal. The two girls parted with the tears and
vows of girlhood. Never to meet on quite the same ground again.
For, disguise the fact as we will, when friends, even the
closest&mdash;perhaps the more because of that very
closeness&mdash;meet again after a separation there is always a
chill, lesser or greater, of change. Neither finds the other
<i>quite</i> the same. This is natural and inevitable. Human nature
is ever growing or retrogressing&mdash;never stationary. But still,
with all our philosophy, who of us can repress a little feeling of
bewildered disappointment when we realize that our friend is not
and never can be just the same as before&mdash;even though the
change may be by way of improvement? Emily, with the strange
intuition which supplied the place of experience, felt this as Ilse
did not, and felt that in a sense she was bidding good-bye for ever
to the Ilse of New Moon days and Shrewsbury years.</p>

<p>Perry Miller, too, former "hired boy" of New Moon, medalist of
Shrewsbury High School, rejected but not quite hopeless suitor of
Emily, butt of Ilse's rages, was gone. Perry was studying law in an
office in Charlottetown, with his eye fixed firmly on several
glittering legal goals. No rainbow ends&mdash;no mythical pots of
gold for Perry. He knew what <i>he</i> wanted would stay put and he
was going after it. People were beginning to believe he would get
it. After all, the gulf between the law clerk in Mr. Abel's office
and the Supreme Court Bench of Canada was no wider than the gulf
between that same law clerk and the barefoot gamin of Stovepipe
Town-by-the-Harbour.</p>

<p>There was more of the rainbow-seeker in Teddy Kent, of the Tansy
Patch. He, too, was going. To the School of Design in Montreal. He,
too, knew&mdash;had known for years&mdash;the delight and
allurement and despair and anguish of the rainbow quest.</p>

<p>"Even if we never find it," he said to Emily, as they lingered
in the New Moon garden under the violet sky of a long, wondrous,
northern twilight, on the last evening before he went away,
"there's something in the search for it that's better than even the
finding would be."</p>

<p>"But we <i>will</i> find it," said Emily, lifting her eyes to a
star that glittered over the tip of one of the Three Princesses.
Something in Teddy's use of "we" thrilled her with its
implications. Emily was always very honest with herself and she
never attempted to shut her eyes to the knowledge that Teddy Kent
meant more to her than anyone else in the world. Whereas
she&mdash;what did she mean to him? Little? Much? Or nothing?</p>

<p>She was bareheaded and she had put a star-like cluster of tiny
yellow 'mums in her hair. She had thought a good deal about her
dress before she decided on her primrose silk. She thought she was
looking very well, but what difference did that make if Teddy
didn't notice it? He always took her so for granted, she thought a
little rebelliously. Dean Priest, now, would have noticed it and
paid her some subtle compliment about it.</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Teddy, morosely scowling at Emily's
topaz-eyed grey cat, Daffy, who was fancying himself as a skulking
tiger in the spirea thicket. "I don't know. Now that I'm really
flying the Blue Peter I feel&mdash;flat. After all&mdash;perhaps I
can never do anything worth while. A little knack of
drawing&mdash;what does it amount to? Especially when you're lying
awake at three o'clock at night?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I know that feeling," agreed Emily. "Last night I mulled
over a story for hours and concluded despairingly that I could
<i>never</i> write&mdash;that it was no use to try&mdash;that I
couldn't do anything really worth while. I went to bed on that note
and drenched my pillow with tears. Woke up at three and couldn't
even cry. Tears seemed as foolish as laughter&mdash;or ambition. I
was quite bankrupt in hope and belief. And then I got up in the
chilly grey dawn and began a new story. Don't let a
three-o'clock-at-night feeling fog your soul."</p>

<p>"Unfortunately there's a three o'clock every night," said Teddy.
"At that ungodly hour I am always convinced that if you want things
<i>too</i> much you're not likely ever to get them. And there are
two things that I want tremendously. One, of course, is to be a
great artist. I never supposed I was a coward, Emily, but I'm
afraid now. If I don't make good! Everybody'll laugh at me. Mother
will say she knew it. She hates to see me go really, you know. To
go and fail! It would be better not to go."</p>

<p>"No, it wouldn't," said Emily passionately, wondering at the
same time in the back of her head what was the <i>other</i> thing
Teddy wanted so tremendously. "You must not be afraid. Father said
I wasn't to be afraid of anything in that talk I had with him the
night he died. And isn't it Emerson who said, 'Always do what you
are afraid to do?'"</p>

<p>"I'll bet Emerson said that when he'd got through with being
afraid of things. It's easy to be brave when you're taking off your
harness."</p>

<p>"You know I believe in you, Teddy," said Emily softly.</p>

<p>"Yes, you do. You and Mr. Carpenter. You are the only ones who
really do believe in me. Even Ilse thinks that Perry has by far the
better chance of bringing home the bacon."</p>

<p>"But you are not going after bacon. You're going after rainbow
gold."</p>

<p>"And if I fail to find it&mdash;and disappoint you&mdash;that
will be worst of all."</p>

<p>"You <i>won't</i> fail. Look at that star, Teddy&mdash;the one
just over the youngest Princess. It's Vega of the Lyre. I've always
loved it. It's my dearest among the stars. Do you remember how,
years ago when you and Ilse and I sat out in the orchard on the
evenings when Cousin Jimmy was boiling pigs' potatoes, you used to
spin us wonderful tales about that star&mdash;and of a life you had
lived in it before you came to this world. There was no three
o'clock in the morning in that star."</p>

<p>"What happy, carefree little shavers we were those times," said
Teddy, in the reminiscent voice of a middle-aged, care-oppressed
man wistfully recalling youthful irresponsibility.</p>

<p>"I want you to promise me," said Emily, "that whenever you see
that star you'll remember that I am believing in
you&mdash;<i>hard."</i></p>

<p>"Will you promise <i>me</i> that whenever you look at that star
you'll think of me?" said Teddy. "Or rather, let us promise each
other that whenever we see that star we'll <i>always</i> think of
each other&mdash;<i>always.</i> Everywhere and as long as we
live."</p>

<p>"I promise," said Emily, thrilled. She loved to have Teddy look
at her like that.</p>

<p>A romantic compact. Meaning what? Emily did not know. She only
knew that Teddy was going away&mdash;that life seemed suddenly very
blank and cold&mdash;that the wind from the gulf, sighing among the
trees in Lofty John's bush was very sorrowful&mdash;that summer had
gone and autumn had come. And that the pot of gold at the rainbow's
end was on some very far-distant hill.</p>

<p>Why had she said that thing about the star? Why did dusk and
fir-scent and the afterglow of autumnal sunsets make people say
absurd things?</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>"NEW MOON,</p>

<p>"NOVEMBER 18, 19&mdash;</p>

<p>"To-day the December number of <i>Marchwood's</i> came with my
verses <i>Flying Gold</i> in it. I consider the occasion worthy of
mention in my diary because they were given a whole page to
themselves and illustrated&mdash;the first time ever any poem of
mine was so honoured. It is trashy enough in itself, I
suppose&mdash;Mr. Carpenter only sniffed when I read it to him and
refused to make any comment whatever on it. Mr. Carpenter never
'damns with faint praise' but he can damn with silence in a most
smashing manner. But my poem <i>looked</i> so dignified that a
careless reader might fancy there was something in it. Blessings on
the good editor who was inspired to have it illustrated. He has
bolstered up my self-respect considerably.</p>

<p>"But I did not care overmuch for the illustration itself. The
artist did not catch my meaning at all. Teddy would have done
better.</p>

<p>"Teddy is doing splendidly at the School of Design. And Vega
shines brilliantly every night. I wonder if he really does always
think of me when he sees it. Or if he ever does see it. Perhaps the
electric lights of Montreal blot it out. He seems to see a good bit
of Ilse. It's awfully nice for them to know each other in that big
city of strangers."</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>"NOVEMBER 26, 19&mdash;</p>

<p>"To-day was a glamorous November afternoon&mdash;summer-mild and
autumn-sweet. I sat and read a long while in the pond
burying-ground. Aunt Elizabeth thinks this a most gruesome place to
sit in and tells Aunt Laura that she is afraid there's a morbid
streak in me. I can't see anything morbid about it. It's a
beautiful spot where wild, sweet odours are always coming across
Blair Water on the wandering winds. And so quiet and peaceful, with
the old graves all about me&mdash;little green hillocks with small
frosted ferns sprinkled over them. Men and women of my house are
lying there. Men and women who had been victorious&mdash;men and
women who had been defeated&mdash;and their victory and defeat are
now one. I never can feel either much exalted or much depressed
there. The sting and the tang alike go out of things. I like the
old, old red sandstone slabs, especially the one for Mary Murray
with its 'Here I Stay'&mdash;the inscription into which her husband
put all the concealed venom of a lifetime. His grave is right
beside hers and I feel sure they have forgiven each other long ago.
And perhaps they come back sometimes in the dark o' the moon and
look at the inscription and laugh at it. It is growing a little dim
with tiny lichens. Cousin Jimmy has given up scraping them away.
Some day they will overgrow it so that it will be nothing but a
green-and-red-and-silver smear on the old red stone."</p>

<p>"DEC. 20, 19&mdash;</p>

<p>"Something nice happened to-day. I feel pleasantly exhilarated.
<i>Madison's</i> took my story, <i>A Flaw in the Indictment!!!!</i>
Yes, it deserves some exclamation-points after it to a certainty.
If it were not for Mr. Carpenter I would write it in italics.
Italics! Nay, I'd use capitals. It is very hard to get in there.
Don't I know! Haven't I tried repeatedly and gained nothing for my
pains but a harvest of 'we-regrets?' And at last it has opened its
doors to me. To be in <i>Madison's</i> is a clear and unmistakable
sign that you're getting somewhere on the Alpine path. The dear
editor was kind enough to say it was a charming story.</p>

<p>"Nice man!</p>

<p>"He sent me a cheque for fifty dollars. I'll soon be able to
begin to repay Aunt Ruth and Uncle Wallace what they spent on me in
Shrewsbury. Aunt Elizabeth as usual looked at the cheque
suspiciously but for the first time forebore to wonder if the bank
would really cash it. Aunt Laura's beautiful blue eyes beamed with
pride. Aunt Laura's eyes really do beam. She is one of the
Victorians. Edwardian eyes glitter and sparkle and allure but they
never beam. And somehow I do like beaming eyes&mdash;especially
when they beam over my success.</p>

<p>"Cousin Jimmy says that <i>Madison's</i> is worth all the other
Yankee magazines put together in <i>his</i> opinion.</p>

<p>"I wonder if Dean Priest will like <i>A Flaw in the
Indictment.</i> And if he will say so. He <i>never</i> praises
anything I write nowadays. And I feel such a craving to
<i>compel</i> him to. I feel that his is the only commendation,
apart from Mr. Carpenter's, that is worth anything.</p>

<p>"It's odd about Dean. In some mysterious way he seems to be
growing younger. A few years ago I thought of him as quite old. Now
he seems only middle-aged. If this keeps up he'll soon be a mere
youth. I suppose the truth is that my mind is beginning to mature a
bit and I'm catching up with him. Aunt Elizabeth doesn't like my
friendship with him any more than she ever did. Aunt Elizabeth has
a well-marked antipathy to any Priest. But I don't know what I'd do
without Dean's friendship. It's the very salt of life."</p>

<p>"JANUARY 15, 19&mdash;</p>

<p>"To-day was stormy. I had a white night last night after four
rejections of MSS. I had thought especially good. As Miss Royal
predicted, I felt that I had been an awful idiot not to have gone
to New York with her when I had the chance. Oh, I don't wonder
babies always cry when they wake up in the night. So often I want
to do it, too. Everything presses on my soul then and no cloud has
a silver lining. I was blue and disgruntled all the forenoon and
looked forward to the coming of the mail as the one possible rescue
from the doldrums. There is always such a fascinating expectancy
and uncertainty about the mail. What would it bring me? A letter
from Teddy&mdash;Teddy writes the most delightful letters. A nice
thin envelope with a cheque? A fat one woefully eloquent of more
rejected MSS.? One of Ilse's fascinating scrawls? Nothing of the
sort. Merely an irate epistle from Second-cousin-once-removed
Beulah Grant of Derry Pond, who is furious because she thinks I
'put her' into my story <i>Fools of Habit,</i> which has just been
copied into a widely circulated Canadian farm paper. She wrote me a
bitterly reproachful letter which I received to-day. She thinks I
'might have spared an old friend who has always wished me well.'
She is 'not accustomed to being ridiculed in the newspapers' and
will I, in future, be so kind as to refrain from making her the
butt of my supposed wit in the public press.
Second-cousin-once-removed Beulah wields a facile pen of her own,
when it comes to that, and while certain things in her letter hurt
me other parts infuriated me. I never once even <i>thought</i> of
Cousin Beulah when I wrote that story. The character of <i>Aunt
Kate</i> is purely imaginary. And if I <i>had</i> thought of Cousin
Beulah I most certainly wouldn't have put <i>her</i> in a story.
She is too stupid and commonplace. And she isn't a bit like <i>Aunt
Kate,</i> who is, I flattered myself, a vivid, snappy, humorous old
lady.</p>

<p>"But Cousin Beulah wrote to Aunt Elizabeth too, and we have had
a family ruction. Aunt Elizabeth won't believe I am
guiltless&mdash;she declares <i>Aunt Kate</i> is an exact picture
of Cousin Beulah and she politely requests me&mdash;Aunt
Elizabeth's polite requests are awesome things&mdash;<i>not</i> to
caricature my relatives in my future productions.</p>

<p>"'It is not,' said Aunt Elizabeth in her stateliest manner, 'a
thing <i>any</i> Murray should do&mdash;make money out of the
peculiarities of her friends.'</p>

<p>"It was just another of Miss Royal's predictions fulfilled. Oh,
was she as right about everything else? If she was&mdash;</p>

<p>"But the worst slam of all came from Cousin Jimmy, who had
chuckled over <i>Fools of Habit.</i></p>

<p>"'Never mind old Beulah, pussy,' he whispered. 'That was fine.
You certainly did her up brown in <i>Aunt Kate.</i> I recognized
her before I'd read a page. Knew her by her nose.' There you are! I
unluckily happened to dower <i>Aunt Kate</i> with a 'long, drooping
nose.' Nor can it be denied that Cousin Beulah's nose is long
<i>and</i> drooping. People have been hanged on no clearer
circumstantial evidence. It was of no use to wail despairingly that
I had never even thought of Cousin Beulah. Cousin Jimmy just nodded
and chuckled again.</p>

<p>"'Of course. Best to keep it quiet. Best to keep anything like
that pretty quiet.'</p>

<p>"The worst sting in all this is, that if <i>Aunt Kate</i> is
really like Cousin Beulah Grant then I failed egregiously in what I
was trying to do.</p>

<p>"However, I feel much better now than when I began this entry.
I've got quite a bit of resentment and rebellion and discouragement
out of my system.</p>

<p>"That's the chief use of a diary, I believe."</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>"FEB. 3, 19&mdash;</p>

<p>"This was a 'big day.' I had three acceptances. And one editor
asked me to send him some stories. To be sure, I hate having an
editor ask me to send a story, somehow. It's far worse than sending
them unasked. The humiliation of having them returned after all is
far deeper than when one just sends off a MS. to some dim
impersonality behind an editorial desk a thousand miles away.</p>

<p>"And I have decided that I can't write a story 'to order.' 'Tis
a diabolical task. I tried to lately. The editor of <i>Young
People</i> asked me to write a story along certain lines. I wrote
it. He sent it back, pointing out some faults and asking me to
rewrite it. I tried to. I wrote and rewrote and altered and
interlined until my MS. looked like a crazy patchwork of black and
blue and red inks. Finally I lifted one of the covers of the
kitchen stove and dumped in the original yarn and all my variations
thereof.</p>

<p>"After this I'm just going to write what I want to. And the
editors can be&mdash;canonized!</p>

<p>"There are northern lights and a misty new moon to-night."</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>"FEB. 16, 19&mdash;</p>

<p>"My story <i>What the Jest Was Worth</i> was in <i>The Home
Monthly</i> to-day. But I was only one of 'others' on the cover.
However, to balance that I have been listed by name as 'one of the
well-known and popular contributors for the coming year' in
<i>Girlhood Days.</i> Cousin Jimmy has read this editor's foreword
over half a dozen times and I heard him murmuring <i>'well-known
and popular'</i> as he split the kindlings. Then he went to the
corner store and bought me a new Jimmy-book. Every time I pass a
new milestone on the Alpine path Cousin Jimmy celebrates by giving
me a new Jimmy-book. I never buy a notebook for myself. It would
hurt his feelings. He always looks at the little pile of
Jimmy-books on my writing-table with awe and reverence, firmly
believing that all sorts of wonderful literature is locked up in
the hodge-podge of description and characters and 'bits' they
contain.</p>

<p>"I always give Dean my stories to read. I can't help doing it,
although he always brings them back with no comment, or, worse than
no comment&mdash;faint praise. It has become a sort of obsession
with me to <i>make</i> Dean admit I <i>can</i> write something
worth while in its line. <i>That</i> would be triumph. But unless
and until he does, everything will be dust and ashes.
Because&mdash;he <i>knows."</i></p>

<p>"April 2, 19&mdash;</p>

<p>"The spring has affected a certain youth of Shrewsbury who comes
out to New Moon occasionally. He is not a suitor of whom the House
of Murray approves. Nor, which is more important, one of whom E. B.
Starr approves. Aunt Elizabeth was very grim because I went to a
concert with him. She was sitting up when I came home.</p>

<p>"'You see I haven't eloped, Aunt Elizabeth,' I said. 'I promise
you I won't. If I ever want to marry any one I'll tell you so and
marry him in spite of your teeth.'</p>

<p>"I don't know whether Aunt Elizabeth went to bed with an easier
mind or not. Mother eloped&mdash;thank goodness!&mdash;and Aunt
Elizabeth is a firm believer in heredity."</p>

<h3>VI</h3>

<p>"April 15, 19&mdash;</p>

<p>"This evening I went away up the hill and prowled about the
Disappointed House by moonlight. The Disappointed House was built
thirty-seven years ago&mdash;partly built, at least&mdash;for a
bride who never came to it. There it has been ever since, boarded
up, unfinished, heart-broken, haunted by the timid, forsaken ghosts
of things that should have happened but never did. I always feel so
sorry for it. For its poor blind eyes that have never
seen&mdash;that haven't even memories. No homelight ever shone out
through them&mdash;only once, long ago, a gleam of firelight. It
might have been such a nice little house, snuggled against that
wooded hill, pulling little spruces all around it to cover it. A
warm, friendly little house. And a good-natured little house. Not
like the new one at the Corner that Tom Semple is putting up.
<i>It</i> is a bad-tempered house. Vixenish, with little eyes and
sharp elbows. It's odd how much personality a house can have even
before it is ever lived in at all. Once long ago, when Teddy and I
were children, we pried a board off the window and climbed in and
made a fire in the fireplace. Then we sat there and planned out our
lives. We meant to spend them together in that very house. I
suppose Teddy has forgotten all about that childish nonsense. He
writes often and his letters are full and jolly and Teddy-like. And
he tells me all the little things I want to know about his life.
But lately they have become rather impersonal, it seems to me. They
might just as well have been written to Ilse as to me.</p>

<p>"Poor little Disappointed House. I suppose you will always be
disappointed."</p>

<h3>VII</h3>

<p>"May 1, 19&mdash;</p>

<p>"Spring again! Young poplars with golden, ethereal leaves.
Leagues of rippling gulf beyond the silver-and-lilac
sand-dunes.</p>

<p>"The winter has gone with a swiftness incredible, in spite of
some terrible, black three-o'clocks and lonely, discouraged
twilights. Dean will soon be home from Florida. But neither Teddy
nor Ilse is coming home this summer. This gave me a white night or
two recently. Ilse is going to the coast to visit an aunt&mdash;a
mother's sister who never took any notice of her before. And Teddy
has got the chance of illustrating a series of North-west Mounted
Police stories for a New York firm and must spend his holidays
making sketches for it in the far North. Of course it's a splendid
chance for him and I wouldn't be a bit sorry&mdash;if <i>he</i>
seemed a bit sorry because he wasn't coming to Blair Water. But he
didn't.</p>

<p>"Well, I suppose Blair Water and the old life here are to him as
a tale that is told now.</p>

<p>"I didn't realize how much I had been building on Ilse and Teddy
being here for the summer or how much the hope of it had helped me
through a few bad times in the winter. When I let myself remember
that not once this summer will I hear Teddy's signal whistle in
Lofty John's bush&mdash;not once happen on him in our secret,
beautiful haunts of lane and brookside&mdash;not once exchange a
thrilling, significant glance in a crowd when something happened
which had a special meaning for us, all the colour seems to die out
of life, leaving it just a drab, faded thing of shreds and
patches.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Kent met me at the post-office yesterday and stopped to
speak&mdash;something she very rarely does. She hates me as much as
ever.</p>

<p>"'I suppose you have heard that Teddy is not coming home this
summer?'</p>

<p>"'Yes,' I said briefly.</p>

<p>"There was a certain odd, aching triumph in her eyes as she
turned away&mdash;a triumph I understood. She is very unhappy
because Teddy will not be home for <i>her</i> but she is exultant
that he will not be home for <i>me.</i> This shows, she is almost
sure, that he cares nothing about me.</p>

<p>"Well, I dare say she is right. Still one can't be altogether
gloomy in spring.</p>

<p>"And Andrew is engaged! To a girl of whom Aunt Addie entirely
approves. 'I could not be more pleased with Andrew's choice if I
had chosen her myself,' she said this afternoon to Aunt Elizabeth.
<i>To</i> Aunt Elizabeth and <i>at</i> me. Aunt Elizabeth was
coldly glad&mdash;or said she was. Aunt Laura cried a
little&mdash;Aunt Laura always cries a bit when any one she knows
is born or dead or married or engaged or come or gone or polling
his first vote. She couldn't help feeling a little disappointed.
Andrew would have been such a <i>safe</i> husband for me. Certainly
there is no dynamite in Andrew."</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>At first nobody thought Mr. Carpenter's illness serious. He had
had a good many attacks of rheumatism in recent years, laying him
up for a few days. Then he could hobble back to work, as grim and
sarcastic as ever, with a new edge to his tongue. In Mr.
Carpenter's opinion teaching in Blair Water School was not what it
had been. Nothing there now, he said, but rollicking, soulless
young nonentities. Not a soul in the school who could pronounce
February or Wednesday.</p>

<p>"I'm tired trying to make soup in a sieve," he said gruffly.</p>

<p>Teddy and Ilse and Perry and Emily were gone&mdash;the four
pupils who had leavened the school with a saving inspiration.
Perhaps Mr. Carpenter was a little tired of&mdash;everything. He
was not very old, as years go, but he had burned up most of his
constitution in a wild youth. The little, timid, faded slip of a
woman who had been his wife had died unobtrusively in the preceding
autumn. She had never seemed to matter much to Mr. Carpenter; but
he had "gone down" rapidly after her funeral. The school children
went in awe of his biting tongue and his more frequent spurts of
temper. The trustees began to shake their heads and talk of a new
teacher when the school year ended.</p>

<p>Mr. Carpenter's illness began as usual with an attack of
rheumatism. Then there was heart trouble. Dr. Burnley, who went to
see him despite his obstinate refusal to have a doctor, looked
grave and talked mysteriously of a lack of "the will to live." Aunt
Louisa Drummond of Derry Pond came over to nurse him. Mr. Carpenter
submitted to this with a resignation that was a bad omen&mdash;as
if nothing mattered any more.</p>

<p>"Have your own way. She can potter round if it will ease your
consciences. So long as she leaves me alone I don't care what she
does. I <i>won't</i> be fed and I <i>won't</i> be coddled and I
<i>won't</i> have the sheets changed. Can't bear her hair, though.
Too straight and shiny. Tell her to do something to it. And why
does her nose look as if it were always cold?"</p>

<p>Emily ran in every evening to sit awhile with him. She was the
only person the old man cared to see. He did not talk a great deal,
but he liked to open his eyes every few minutes and exchange a sly
smile of understanding with her&mdash;as if the two of them were
laughing together over some excellent joke of which only they could
sample the flavour. Aunt Louisa did not know what to make of this
commerce of grins and consequently disapproved of it. She was a
kind-hearted creature, with much real motherliness in her thwarted
maiden breast, but she was all at sea with these cheerful, Puckish,
deathbed smiles of her patient. She thought he had much better be
thinking of his immortal soul. He was not a member of the church,
was he? He would not even let the minister come in to see him. But
Emily Starr was welcomed whenever she came. Aunt Louisa had her own
secret suspicion of the said Emily Starr. Didn't she write? Hadn't
she put her own mother's second-cousin, body and bones, into one of
her stories? Probably she was looking for "copy" in this old
pagan's deathbed. <i>That</i> explained her interest in it, beyond
a doubt. Aunt Louisa looked curiously at this ghoulish young
creature. She hoped Emily wouldn't put <i>her</i> in a story.</p>

<p>For a long time Emily had refused to believe that it <i>was</i>
Mr. Carpenter's deathbed. He <i>couldn't</i> be so ill as all that.
He didn't suffer&mdash;he didn't complain. He would be all right as
soon as warmer weather came. She told herself this so often that
she made herself believe it. She could not let herself think of
life in Blair Water without Mr. Carpenter.</p>

<p>One May evening Mr. Carpenter seemed much better. His eyes
flashed with their old satiric fire, his voice rang with its old
resonance; he joked poor Aunt Louisa&mdash;who never could
understand his jokes but endured them with Christian patience. Sick
people must be humoured. He told a funny story to Emily and laughed
with her over it till the little low-raftered room rang. Aunt
Louisa shook her head. There were some things she did not know,
poor lady, but she did know her own humble, faithful little trade
of unprofessional nursing; and she knew that this sudden
rejuvenescence was no good sign. As the Scotch would say, he was
"fey." Emily in her inexperience did not know this. She went home
rejoicing that Mr. Carpenter had taken such a turn for the better.
Soon he would be all right, back at school, thundering at his
pupils, striding absently along the road reading some dog-eared
classic, criticizing her manuscripts with all his old trenchant
humour. Emily was glad. Mr. Carpenter was a friend she could not
afford to lose.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>Aunt Elizabeth wakened her at two. She had been sent for. Mr.
Carpenter was asking for her.</p>

<p>"Is he&mdash;worse?" asked Emily, slipping out of her high,
black bed with its carved posts.</p>

<p>"Dying," said Aunt Elizabeth briefly. "Dr. Burnley says he can't
last till morning."</p>

<p>Something in Emily's face touched Aunt Elizabeth.</p>

<p>"Isn't it better for him, Emily," she said with an unusual
gentleness. "He is old and tired. His wife has gone&mdash;they will
not give him the school another year. His old age would be very
lonely. Death is his best friend."</p>

<p>"I am thinking of myself," choked Emily.</p>

<p>She went down to Mr. Carpenter's house, through the dark,
beautiful spring night. Aunt Louisa was crying but Emily did not
cry. Mr. Carpenter opened his eyes and smiled at her&mdash;the same
old, sly smile.</p>

<p>"No tears," he murmured. "I forbid tears at my deathbed. Let
Louisa Drummond do the crying out in the kitchen. She might as well
earn her money that way as another. There's nothing more she can do
for me."</p>

<p>"Is there anything <i>I</i> can do?" asked Emily.</p>

<p>"Just sit here where I can see you till I'm gone, that's all.
One doesn't like to go out&mdash;alone. Never liked the thought of
dying alone. How many old she-weasels are out in the kitchen
waiting for me to die?"</p>

<p>"There are only Aunt Louisa and Aunt Elizabeth," said Emily,
unable to repress a smile.</p>

<p>"Don't mind my not&mdash;talking much. I've been
talking&mdash;all my life. Through now. No breath&mdash;left. But
if I think of anything&mdash;like you to be here."</p>

<p>Mr. Carpenter closed his eyes and relapsed into silence. Emily
sat quietly, her head a soft blur of darkness against the window
that was beginning to whiten with dawn. The ghostly hands of a
fitful wind played with her hair. The perfume of June lilies stole
in from the bed under the open window&mdash;a haunting odour,
sweeter than music, like all the lost perfumes of old, unutterably
dear years. Far off, two beautiful, slender, black firs, of exactly
the same height, came out against the silver dawn-lit sky like the
twin spires of some Gothic cathedral rising out of a bank of silver
mist. Just between them hung a dim old moon, as beautiful as the
evening crescent. Their beauty was a comfort and stimulant to Emily
under the stress of this strange vigil. Whatever
passed&mdash;whatever came&mdash;beauty like this was eternal.</p>

<p>Now and then Aunt Louisa came in and looked at the old man. Mr.
Carpenter seemed unconscious of these visitations but always when
she went out he opened his eyes and winked at Emily. Emily found
herself winking back, somewhat to her own horror&mdash;for she had
sufficient Murray in her to be slightly scandalized over deathbed
winks. Fancy what Aunt Elizabeth would say.</p>

<p>"Good little sport," muttered Mr. Carpenter after the second
exchange of winks. "Glad&mdash;you're there."</p>

<p>At three o'clock he grew rather restless. Aunt Louisa came in
again.</p>

<p>"He can't die till the tide goes out, you know," she explained
to Emily in a solemn whisper.</p>

<p>"Get out of this with your superstitious blather," said Mr.
Carpenter loudly and clearly. "I'll die when I'm d&mdash;n well
ready, tide or no tide."</p>

<p>Horrified Aunt Louisa excused him to Emily on the ground that he
was wandering in his mind and slipped out.</p>

<p>"Excuse my common way, won't you?" said Mr. Carpenter. "I
<i>had</i> to shock her out. Couldn't have that elderly female
person&mdash;round watching me die. Given her&mdash;a good yarn to
tell&mdash;the rest of her&mdash;life. Awful&mdash;warning. And
yet&mdash;she's a good soul. So good&mdash;she bores me. No evil in
her. Somehow&mdash;one needs&mdash;a spice&mdash;of evil&mdash;in
every personality. It's the&mdash;pinch of&mdash;salt&mdash;that
brings out&mdash;the flavour."</p>

<p>Another silence. Then he added gravely,</p>

<p>"Trouble is&mdash;the Cook&mdash;makes the pinch&mdash;too
large&mdash;in most cases. Inexperienced Cook&mdash;wiser
after&mdash;a few eternities."</p>

<p>Emily thought he really was "wandering" now but he smiled at
her.</p>

<p>"Glad you're here&mdash;little pal. Don't mind
being&mdash;here&mdash;do you?"</p>

<p>"No," said Emily.</p>

<p>"When a Murray says&mdash;no&mdash;she means it."</p>

<p>After another silence Mr. Carpenter began again, this time more
to himself, as it seemed, than anyone else.</p>

<p>"Going out&mdash;out beyond the dawn. Past the morning star.
Used to think I'd be frightened. Not frightened. Funny. Think how
much I'm going to know&mdash;in just a few more minutes, Emily.
Wiser than anybody else living. Always wanted to know&mdash;to
<i>know.</i> Never liked guesses. Done with curiosity&mdash;about
life. Just curious now&mdash;about death. I'll know the truth,
Emily&mdash;just a few more minutes and I'll know the&mdash;truth.
No more guessing. And if&mdash;it's as I think&mdash;I'll
be&mdash;young again. You can't know what&mdash;it means.
You&mdash;who <i>are</i> young&mdash;can't have&mdash;the least
idea&mdash;what it means&mdash;to be young&mdash;<i>again."</i></p>

<p>His voice sank into restless muttering for a time, then rose
clearly,</p>

<p>"Emily, promise me&mdash;that you'll never write&mdash;to please
anybody&mdash;but yourself."</p>

<p>Emily hesitated a moment. Just what did such a promise mean?</p>

<p>"Promise," whispered Mr. Carpenter insistently.</p>

<p>Emily promised.</p>

<p>"That's right," said Mr. Carpenter with a sigh of relief. "Keep
that&mdash;and you'll be&mdash;all right. No use trying to please
everybody. No use trying to please&mdash;critics. Live under your
own hat. Don't be&mdash;led away&mdash;by those howls about
realism. Remember&mdash;pine woods are just as real
as&mdash;pigsties&mdash;and a darn sight pleasanter to be in.
You'll get there&mdash;sometime&mdash;you have the root&mdash;of
the matter&mdash;in you. And don't&mdash;tell the
world&mdash;everything. That's what's the&mdash;matter&mdash;with
our&mdash;literature. Lost the charm of mystery&mdash;and reserve.
There's something else I wanted to say&mdash;some caution&mdash;I
can't&mdash;seem to remember&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't try," said Emily gently. "Don't tire yourself."</p>

<p>"Not&mdash;tired. Feel quite through&mdash;with being tired. I'm
dying&mdash;I'm a failure&mdash;poor as a rat. But after all,
Emily&mdash;I've had a&mdash;darned interesting time."</p>

<p>Mr. Carpenter shut his eyes and looked so deathlike that Emily
made an involuntary movement of alarm. He lifted a bleached
hand.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;don't call her. Don't call that weeping lady back.
Just yourself, little Emily of New Moon. Clever little girl, Emily.
What was it&mdash;I wanted to say to her?"</p>

<p>A moment or two later he opened his eyes and said in a loud,
clear voice, "Open the door&mdash;open the door. Death must not be
kept waiting."</p>

<p>Emily ran to the little door and set it wide. A strong wind of
the grey sea rushed in. Aunt Louisa ran in from the kitchen.</p>

<p>"The tide has turned&mdash;he's going out with it&mdash;he's
gone."</p>

<p>Not quite. As Emily bent over him the keen, shaggy-brown eyes
opened for the last time. Mr. Carpenter essayed a wink but could
not compass it.</p>

<p>"I've&mdash;thought of it," he whispered.
"Beware&mdash;of&mdash;italics."</p>

<p>Was there a little impish chuckle at the end of the words? Aunt
Louisa always declared there was. Graceless old Mr. Carpenter had
died laughing&mdash;saying something about Italians. Of course he
was delirious. But Aunt Louisa always felt it had been a very
unedifying deathbed. She was thankful that few such had come in her
experience.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>Emily went blindly home and wept for her old friend in the room
of her dreams. What a gallant old soul he was&mdash;going out into
the shadow&mdash;or into the sunlight?&mdash;with a laugh and a
jest. Whatever his faults there had never been anything of the
coward about old Mr. Carpenter. Her world, she knew, would be a
colder place now that he was gone. It seemed many years since she
had left New Moon in the darkness. She felt some inward monition
that told her she had come to a certain parting of the ways of
life. Mr. Carpenter's death would not make any external difference
for her. Nevertheless, it was as a milestone to which in after
years she could look back and say,</p>

<p>"After I passed that point everything was different."</p>

<p>All her life she had grown, as it seemed, by these fits and
starts. Going on quietly and changelessly for months and years;
then all at once suddenly realizing that she had left some
"low-vaulted past" and emerged into some "new temple" of the soul
more spacious than all that had gone before. Though always, at
first, with a chill of change and a sense of loss.</p>

<hr><h2><a name="C04" id="C04"><i>Chapter IV</i></a>
</h2>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>The year after Mr. Carpenter's death passed quietly for
Emily&mdash;quietly, pleasantly&mdash;perhaps, though she tried to
stifle the thought, a little monotonously. No Ilse&mdash;no
Teddy&mdash;no Mr. Carpenter. Perry only very occasionally. But of
course in the summer there was Dean. No girl with Dean Priest for a
friend could be altogether lonely. They had always been such good
friends, ever since the day, long ago, when she had fallen over the
rocky bank of Malvern Bay and been rescued by Dean.* It did not
matter in the least that he limped slightly and had a crooked
shoulder, or that the dreamy brilliance of his green eyes sometimes
gave his face an uncanny look. On the whole, there was no one in
all the world she <i>liked</i> quite so well as Dean. When she
thought this she always italicized the "liked." There were some
things Mr. Carpenter had not known.</p>

<p>*See <i>Emily of New Moon.</i></p>

<p>Aunt Elizabeth never quite approved of Dean. But then Aunt
Elizabeth had no great love for any Priest.</p>

<p>There seemed to be a temperamental incompatibility between the
Murrays and the Priests that was never bridged over, even by the
occasional marriages between the clans.</p>

<p>"Priests, indeed," Aunt Elizabeth was wont to say
contemptuously, relegating the whole clan, root and branch, to
limbo with one wave of her thin, unbeautiful Murray hand. "Priests,
indeed!"</p>

<p>"Murray is Murray and Priest is Priest and never the twain shall
meet," Emily shamelessly mischievously misquoted Kipling once when
Dean had asked in pretended despair why none of her aunts liked
him.</p>

<p>"Your old Great-aunt Nancy over there at Priest Pond detests
me," he said, with the little whimsical smile that sometimes gave
him the look of an amused gnome, "And the Ladies Laura and
Elizabeth treat me with the frosty politeness reserved by the
Murrays for their dearest foes. Oh, I think I know why."</p>

<p>Emily flushed. She, too, was beginning to have an unwelcome
suspicion why Aunts Elizabeth and Laura were even more frostily
polite to Dean than of yore. She did not want to have it; she
thrust it fiercely out and locked the door of thought upon it
whenever it intruded there. But the thing whined on her doorstep
and would not be banished. Dean, like everything and everybody
else, seemed to have changed overnight. And what did the change
imply&mdash;hint? Emily refused to answer this question. The only
answer that suggested itself was too absurd. And too unwelcome.</p>

<p>Was Dean Priest changing from friend to lover? Nonsense. Arrant
nonsense. Disagreeable nonsense. For she did not want him as a
lover and she did want him madly as a friend. She <i>couldn't</i>
lose his friendship. It was too dear, delightful, stimulating,
wonderful. Why did such devilish things ever happen? When Emily
reached this point in her disconnected musings she always stopped
and retraced her mental steps fiercely, terrified to realize that
she was almost on the point of admitting that "the something
devilish" had already happened or was in process of happening.</p>

<p>In one way it was almost a relief to her when Dean said casually
one November evening:</p>

<p>"I suppose I must soon be thinking of my annual migration."</p>

<p>"Where are you going this year?" asked Emily.</p>

<p>"Japan. I've never been there. Don't want to go now
particularly. But what's the use of staying? Would you want to talk
to me in the sitting-room all winter with the aunts in
hearing?"</p>

<p>"No," said Emily between a laugh and a shiver. She recalled one
fiendish autumn evening of streaming rain and howling wind when
they couldn't walk in the garden but had to sit in the room where
Aunt Elizabeth was knitting and Aunt Laura crocheting by the table.
It had been awful. And again why? Why couldn't they talk as freely
and whimsically and intimately then as they did in the garden? The
answer to this at least was not to be expressed in any terms of
sex. Was it because they talked of so many things Aunt Elizabeth
could not understand and so disapproved of? Perhaps. But whatever
the cause Dean might as well have been at the other side of the
world for all the real conversation that was possible.</p>

<p>"So I might as well go," said Dean, waiting for this exquisite,
tall, white girl in an old garden to say she would miss him
horribly. She had said it every one of his flitting autumns for
many years. But she did not say it this time. She found she dared
not.</p>

<p>Again, why?</p>

<p>Dean was looking at her with eyes that could be tender or
sorrowful or passionate, as he willed, and which now seemed to be a
mixture of all three expressions. He <i>must</i> hear her say she
would miss him. His true reason for going away again this winter
was to make her realize how much she missed him&mdash;make her feel
that she could not live without him.</p>

<p>"Will you miss me, Emily?"</p>

<p>"That goes without saying," answered Emily lightly&mdash;too
lightly. Other years she had been very frank and serious about it.
Dean was not altogether regretful for the change. But he could
guess nothing of the attitude of mind behind it. She must have
changed because she felt something&mdash;suspected something, of
what he had striven for years to hide and suppress as rank madness.
What then? Did this new lightness indicate that she didn't want to
make a too important thing of admitting she would miss him? Or was
it only the instinctive defence of a woman against something that
implied or evoked too much?</p>

<p>"It will be so dreadful here this winter without you and Teddy
and Ilse that I will not let myself think of it at all," went on
Emily. "Last winter was bad. And this&mdash;I know
somehow&mdash;will be worse. But I'll have my work."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, your work," agreed Dean with the little, tolerant,
half-amused inflection in his voice that always came now when he
spoke of her "work," as if it tickled him hugely that she should
call her pretty scribblings "work." Well, one must humour the
charming child. He could not have said so more plainly in words.
His implications cut across Emily's sensitive soul like a
whip-lash. And all at once her work and her ambitions
became&mdash;momentarily at least&mdash;as childish and unimportant
as he considered them. She could not hold her own conviction
against him. He must know. He was so clever&mdash;so well-educated.
He <i>must</i> know. That was the agony of it. She could not ignore
his opinion. Emily knew deep down in her heart that she would never
be able wholly to believe in herself until Dean Priest admitted
that she could do something honestly worth while in its way. And if
he never admitted it&mdash;</p>

<p>"I shall carry pictures of you wherever I go, Star," Dean was
saying. Star was his old nickname for her&mdash;not as a pun on her
name but because he said she reminded him of a star. "I shall see
you sitting in your room by that old lookout window, spinning your
pretty cobwebs&mdash;pacing up and down in this old
garden&mdash;wandering in the Yesterday Road&mdash;looking out to
sea. Whenever I shall recall a bit of Blair Water loveliness I
shall see you in it. After all, all other beauty is only a
background for a beautiful woman."</p>

<p>"Her pretty cobwebs&mdash;" ah, there it was. That was all Emily
heard. She did not even realize that he was telling her he thought
<i>her</i> a beautiful woman.</p>

<p>"Do you think what I write is nothing but cobwebs, Dean?" she
asked chokingly.</p>

<p>Dean looked surprised, doing it very well.</p>

<p>"Star, what else is it? What do you think it is yourself? I'm
glad you can amuse yourself by writing. It's a splendid thing to
have a little hobby of the kind. And if you can pick up a few
shekels by it&mdash;well, that's all very well too in this kind of
a world. But I'd hate to have you dream of being a Bront&euml; or
an Austen&mdash;and wake to find you'd wasted your youth on a
dream."</p>

<p>"I don't fancy myself a Bront&euml; or an Austen," said Emily.
"But you didn't talk like that long ago, Dean. You used to think
then I <i>could</i> do something some day."</p>

<p>"We don't bruise the pretty visions of a child," said Dean. "But
it's foolish to carry childish dreams over into maturity. Better
face facts. You write charming things of their kind, Emily. Be
content with that and don't waste your best years yearning for the
unattainable or striving to reach some height far beyond your
grasp."</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>Dean was not looking at Emily. He was leaning on the old sundial
and scowling down at it with the air of a man who was forcing
himself to say a disagreeable thing because he felt it was his
duty.</p>

<p>"I <i>won't</i> be just a mere scribbler of pretty stories,"
cried Emily rebelliously. He looked into her face. She was as tall
as he was&mdash;a trifle taller, though he would not admit it.</p>

<p>"You do not need to be anything but what you are," he said in a
low vibrant tone. "A woman such as this old New Moon has never seen
before. You can do more with those eyes&mdash;that smile&mdash;than
you can ever do with your pen."</p>

<p>"You sound like Great-aunt Nancy Priest," said Emily cruelly and
contemptuously.</p>

<p>But had he not been cruel and contemptuous to her? Three o'clock
that night found her wide-eyed and anguished. She had lain through
sleepless hours face to face with two hateful convictions. One was
that she could never do anything worth doing with her pen. The
other was that she was going to lose Dean's friendship. For
friendship was all she could give him and it would not satisfy him.
She must hurt him. And oh, how could she hurt Dean whom life had
used so cruelly? She had said "no" to Andrew Murray and laughed a
refusal to Perry Miller without a qualm. But this was an utterly
different thing.</p>

<p>Emily sat up in bed in the darkness and moaned in a despair that
was none the less real and painful because of the indisputable fact
that thirty years later she might be wondering what on earth she
had been moaning about.</p>

<p>"I wish there were no such things as lovers and love-making in
the world," she said with savage intensity, honestly believing she
meant it.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>Like everybody, in daylight Emily found things much less tragic
and more endurable than in the darkness. A nice fat cheque and a
kind letter of appreciation with it restored a good deal of her
self-respect and ambition. Very likely, too, she had imagined
implications into Dean's words and looks that he never meant. She
was not going to be a silly goose, fancying that every man, young
or old, who liked to talk to her, or even to pay her compliments in
shadowy, moonlit gardens, was in love with her. Dean was old enough
to be her father.</p>

<p>Dean's unsentimental parting when he went away confirmed her in
this comforting assurance and left her free to miss him without any
reservations. Miss him she did abominably. The rain in autumn
fields that year was a very sorrowful thing and so were the grey
ghost-fogs coming slowly in from the gulf. Emily was glad when snow
and sparkle came. She was very busy, writing such long hours, often
far into the night, that Aunt Laura began to worry over her health
and Aunt Elizabeth once or twice remarked protestingly that the
price of coal-oil had gone up. As Emily paid for her own coal-oil
this hint had no effect on her. She was very keen about making
enough money to repay Uncle Wallace and Aunt Ruth what they had
spent on her high school years. Aunt Elizabeth thought this was a
praiseworthy ambition. The Murrays were an independent folk. It was
a clan by-word that the Murrays had a boat of their own at the
Flood. No promiscuous Ark for <i>them.</i></p>

<p>Of course there were still many rejections&mdash;which Cousin
Jimmy carried home from the post-office speechless with
indignation. But the percentage of acceptances rose steadily. Every
new magazine conquered meant a step upward on her Alpine path. She
knew she was steadily gaining the mastery over her art. Even the
"love talk" that had bothered her so much in the old days came
easily now. Had Teddy Kent's eyes taught her so much? If she had
taken time to think she might have been very lonely. There were
some bad hours. Especially after a letter had come from Ilse full
of all her gay doings in Montreal, her triumphs in the School of
Oratory and her pretty new gowns. In the long twilights when she
looked shiveringly from the windows of the old farmhouse and
thought how very white and cold and solitary were the snow fields
on the hill, how darkly remote and tragic the Three Princesses, she
lost confidence in her star. She wanted summer; fields of daisies;
seas misty with moonrise or purple with sunset; companionship;
Teddy. In such moments she always knew she wanted Teddy.</p>

<p>Teddy seemed far away. They still corresponded faithfully, but
the correspondence was not what it was. Suddenly in the autumn
Teddy's letters had grown slightly colder and more formal. At this
first hint of frost the temperature of Emily's dropped
noticeably.</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>But she had hours of rapture and insight that shed a glory
backward and forward. Hours when she felt the creative faculty
within her, burning like a never-dying flame. Rare, sublime moments
when she felt as a god, perfectly happy and undesirous. And there
was always her dream-world into which she could escape from
monotony and loneliness, and taste strange, sweet happiness
unmarred by any cloud or shadow. Sometimes she slipped mentally
back into childhood and had delightful adventures she would have
been ashamed to tell her adult world.</p>

<p>She liked to prowl about a good deal by herself, especially in
twilight or moonlight alone with the stars and the trees, rarest of
companions.</p>

<p>"I can't be contented indoors on a moonlight night. I have to be
up and away," she told Aunt Elizabeth, who did not approve of
prowling. Aunt Elizabeth never lost her uneasy consciousness that
Emily's mother had eloped. And anyhow, prowling was odd. None of
the other Blair Water girls prowled.</p>

<p>There were walks over the hills in the owl's light when the
stars rose&mdash;one after another, the great constellations of
myth and legend. There were frosty moonrises that hurt her with
their beauty; spires of pointed firs against fiery sunsets; spruce
copses dim with mystery; pacings to and fro on the To-morrow Road.
Not the To-morrow Road of June, blossom-misted, tender in young
green. Nor yet the To-morrow Road of October, splendid in crimson
and gold. But the To-morrow Road of a still, snowy winter
twilight&mdash;a white, mysterious, silent place full of wizardry.
Emily loved it better than all her other dear spots. The spirit
delight of that dream-haunted solitude never cloyed&mdash;its
remote charm never palled.</p>

<p>If only there had been a friend to talk things over with! One
night she awakened and found herself in tears, with a late moon
shining bluely and coldly on her through the frosted window-panes.
She had dreamed that Teddy had whistled to her from Lofty John's
bush&mdash;the old, dear, signal whistle of childhood days; and she
had run so eagerly across the garden to the bush. But she could not
find Teddy.</p>

<p>"Emily Byrd Starr, if I catch you crying again over a dream!"
she said passionately.</p>

<hr><h2><a name="C05" id="C05"><i>Chapter V</i></a>
</h2>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>Only three dynamic things happened that year to vary the
noiseless tenor of Emily's way. In the autumn she had a love
affair&mdash;as Aunt Laura Victorianly phrased it. Rev. James
Wallace, the new, well-meaning, ladylike young minister at Derry
Pond, began making excuses for visiting Blair Water Manse quite
often and from there drifted over to New Moon. Soon everybody in
Blair Water and Derry Pond knew that Emily Starr had a ministerial
beau. Gossip was very rife. It was a foregone conclusion that Emily
would jump at him. A minister! Heads were shaken over it. She would
never make a suitable minister's wife. Never in the world. But
wasn't it always the way? A minister picking on the very last girl
he should have.</p>

<p>At New Moon opinion was divided. Aunt Laura, who owned to a Dr.
Fell feeling about Mr. Wallace, hoped Emily wouldn't "take" him.
Aunt Elizabeth, in her secret soul, was not overfond of him either,
but she was dazzled by the idea of a minister. And such a safe
lover. A minister would never think of eloping. She thought Emily
would be a very lucky girl if she could "get" him.</p>

<p>When it became sadly evident that Mr. Wallace's calls at New
Moon had ceased, Aunt Elizabeth gloomily asked Emily the reason and
was horrified to hear that the ungrateful minx had told Mr. Wallace
she could not marry him.</p>

<p>"Why?" demanded Aunt Elizabeth in icy disapproval.</p>

<p>"His ears, Aunt Elizabeth, his ears," said Emily flippantly. "I
really couldn't risk having my children inherit ears like
that."</p>

<p>The indelicacy of such a reply staggered Aunt
Elizabeth&mdash;which was probably why Emily had made it. She knew
Aunt Elizabeth would be afraid to refer to the subject again.</p>

<p>The Rev. James Wallace thought it was "his duty" to go West the
next spring. And that was that.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>Then there was the episode of the local theatricals in
Shrewsbury which were written up with vitriolic abuse in one of the
Charlottetown papers. Shrewsbury people blamed Emily Byrd Starr for
doing it. Who else, they demanded, could or would have written with
such diabolic cleverness and sarcasm? Every one knew that Emily
Byrd Starr had never forgiven Shrewsbury people for believing those
yarns about her in the old John House affair. This was her method
of revenge. Wasn't that like the Murrays? Carrying a secret grudge
for years, until a suitable chance for revenge presented itself.
Emily protested her innocence in vain. It was never discovered who
had written the report and as long as she lived it kept coming up
against her.</p>

<p>But in one way it worked out to her advantage. She was invited
to all the social doings in Shrewsbury after that. People were
afraid to leave her out lest she "write them up." She could not get
to everything&mdash;Shrewsbury was seven miles from Blair Water.
But she got to Mrs. Tom Nickle's dinner dance and thought for six
weeks that it had changed the current of her whole existence.</p>

<p>Emily-in-the-glass looked very well that night. She had got the
dress she had longed for for years&mdash;spent the whole price of a
story on it, to her Aunt's horror. Shot silk&mdash;blue in one
light, silver in another, with mists of lace. She remembered that
Teddy had said that when she got that dress he would paint her as
an Ice-maiden in it.</p>

<p>Her right-hand neighbour was a man who kept making "funny
speeches" all through the meal and kept her wondering for what good
purpose God had ever fashioned him.</p>

<p>But her left-hand neighbour! He talked little but he looked!
Emily decided that she liked a man whose eyes said more than his
lips. But he told her she looked like "the moonbeam of a blue
summer night" in that gown. I think it was that phrase that
finished Emily&mdash;shot her clean through the heart&mdash;like
the unfortunate little duck of the nursery rhyme. Emily was
helpless before the charm of a well-turned phrase. Before the
evening was over Emily, for the first time in her life, had fallen
wildly and romantically into the wildest and most romantic kind of
love&mdash;"the love the poets dreamed of," as she wrote in her
diary. The young man&mdash;I believe his beautiful and romantic
name was Aylmer Vincent&mdash;was quite as madly in love as she. He
literally haunted New Moon. He wooed beautifully. His way of saying
"dear lady" charmed her. When he told her that "a beautiful hand
was one of the chief charms of a beautiful woman" and looked
adoringly at hers Emily kissed her hands when she went to her room
that night because <i>his</i> eyes had caressed them. When he
called her raptly "a creature of mist and flame" she misted and
flamed about dim old New Moon until Aunt Elizabeth unthinkingly
quenched her by asking her to fry up a batch of doughnuts for
Cousin Jimmy. When he told her she was like an
opal&mdash;milk-white outside but with a heart of fire and crimson,
she wondered if life would always be like this.</p>

<p>"And to think I once imagined I cared for Teddy Kent," she
thought in amazement at herself.</p>

<p>She neglected her writing and asked Aunt Elizabeth if she could
have the old blue box in the attic for a hope chest. Aunt Elizabeth
graciously acceded. The record of the new suitor had been
investigated and found impeccable. Good family&mdash;good social
position&mdash;good business. All the omens were auspicious.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>And then a truly terrible thing happened.</p>

<p>Emily fell out of love just as suddenly as she had fallen into
it. One day she was, and the next she wasn't. That was all there
was to it.</p>

<p>She was aghast. She couldn't believe it. She tried to pretend
the old enchantment still existed. She tried to thrill and dream
and blush. Nary thrill, nary blush. Her dark-eyed
lover&mdash;<i>why</i> had it never struck her before that his eyes
were exactly like a cow's?&mdash;bored her. Ay, bored her. She
yawned one evening in the very midst of one of his fine speeches.
Why, there was nothing to him but fine speeches. There was nothing
to add to that.</p>

<p>She was so ashamed that she was almost ill over it. Blair people
thought she had been jilted and pitied her. The aunts who knew
better were disappointed and disapproving.</p>

<p>"Fickle&mdash;fickle&mdash;like all the Starrs," said Aunt
Elizabeth bitterly.</p>

<p>Emily had no spunk to defend herself. She supposed she deserved
it all. Perhaps she was fickle. She must be fickle. When such a
glorious conflagration fizzled out so speedily and utterly into
ashes. Not a spark of it left. Not even a romantic memory. Emily
viciously inked out the passage in her diary about "the love the
poets dreamed of."</p>

<p>She was really very unhappy about it for a long while. Had she
no depth at all? Was she such a superficial creature that even love
with her was like the seeds that fell into the shallow soil in the
immortal parable? She knew other girls had these silly,
tempestuous, ephemeral affairs but she would never have supposed
she would have one&mdash;<i>could</i> have one. To be swept off her
feet like that by a handsome face and mellifluous voice and great
dark eyes and a trick of pretty speeches! In brief Emily felt that
she had made an absolute fool of herself and the Murray pride could
not stick it.</p>

<p>To make it worse the young man married a Shrewsbury girl in six
months. Not that Emily cared whom he married or how soon. But it
meant that <i>his</i> romantic ardours were but things of
superficiality, too, and lent a deeper tinge of humiliation to the
silly affair. Andrew had been so easily consoled also. Percy Miller
was not wasting in despair. Teddy had forgotten her. Was she really
incapable of inspiring a deep and lasting passion in a man? To be
sure, there was Dean. But even Dean could go away winter after
winter and leave her to be wooed and won by any chance-met
suitor.</p>

<p>"Am I fundamentally superficial?" poor Emily demanded of herself
with terrible intensity</p>

<p>She took up her pen again with a secret gladness. But for a
considerable time the love-making in her stories was quite cynical
and misanthropic in its flavour.</p>

<hr><h2><a name="C06" id="C06"><i>Chapter VI</i></a>
</h2>

<p><i>&nbsp;</i>
</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>Teddy Kent and Ilse Burnley came home in the summer for a brief
vacation. Teddy had won an Art Scholarship which meant two years in
Paris and was to sail for Europe in two weeks. He had written the
news to Emily in an off-hand way and she had responded with the
congratulations of a friend and sister. There was no reference in
either letter to rainbow gold or Vega of the Lyre. Yet Emily looked
forward to his coming with a wistful, ashamed hope that would not
be denied. Perhaps&mdash;dared she hope it?&mdash;when they met
again face to face, in their old haunted woods and
trysts&mdash;this coldness that had grown up so inexplicably
between them would vanish as a sea-fog vanishes when the sun rose
over the gulf. No doubt Teddy had had his imitation love affairs as
she had hers. But when he came&mdash;when they looked again into
each other's eyes&mdash;when she heard his signal whistle in Lofty
John's bush&mdash;</p>

<p>But she never heard it. On the evening of the day when she knew
Teddy was expected home she walked in the garden among brocaded
moths, wearing a new gown of "powder-blue" chiffon and listened for
it. Every robin call brought the blood to her cheek and made her
heart beat wildly. Then came Aunt Laura through the dew and
dusk.</p>

<p>"Teddy and Ilse are here," she said.</p>

<p>Emily went in to the stately, stiff, dignified parlour of New
Moon, pale, queenly, aloof. Ilse hurled herself upon her with all
her old, tempestuous affection, but Teddy shook hands with a cool
detachment that almost equalled her own. Teddy? Oh, dear, no.
Frederick Kent, R.A.-to-be. What was there left of the old Teddy in
this slim, elegant young man with his sophisticated air and cool,
impersonal eyes, and general implication of having put off for ever
all childish things&mdash;including foolish old visions and
insignificant little country girls he had played with in his
infancy?</p>

<p>In which conclusion Emily was horribly unjust to Teddy. But she
was not in a mood to be just to anybody. Nobody is who has made a
fool of herself. And Emily felt that that was just what she had
done&mdash;again. Mooning romantically about in a twilight garden,
specially wearing powder-blue, waiting for a lover's signal from a
beau who had forgotten all about her&mdash;or only remembered her
as an old schoolmate on whom he had very properly and kindly and
conscientiously come to call. Well, thank heaven, Teddy did not
know how absurd she had been. She would take excellent care that he
should never suspect it. Who could be more friendly and remote than
a Murray of New Moon? Emily's manner, she flattered herself, was
admirable. As gracious and impersonal as to an entire stranger.
Renewed congratulations on his wonderful success, coupled with an
absolute lack of all real interest in it. Carefully phrased, polite
questions about <i>his</i> work on her side; carefully phrased
polite questions about <i>her</i> work on his side. She had seen
some of <i>his</i> pictures in the magazines. He had read some of
<i>her</i> stories. So it went, with a wider gulf opening between
them at every moment. Never had Emily felt herself so far away from
Teddy. She recognized with a feeling that was almost terror how
completely he had changed in those two years of absence. It would
in truth have been a ghastly interview had it not been for Ilse,
who chattered with all her old breeziness and tang, planning out a
two weeks of gay doings while she was home, asking hundreds of
questions; the same lovable old madcap of laughter and jest and
dressed with all her old gorgeous violations of accepted canons of
taste. In an extraordinary dress&mdash;a thing of greenish-yellow.
She had a big pink peony at her waist and another at her shoulder.
She wore a bright green hat with a wreath of pink flowers on it.
Great hoops of pearl swung in her ears. It was a weird costume. No
one but Ilse could have worn it successfully. And she looked like
the incarnation of a thousand tropic springs in it&mdash;exotic,
provocative, beautiful. So beautiful! Emily realized her friend's
beauty afresh with a pang not of envy, but of bitter humiliation.
Beside Ilse's golden sheen of hair and brilliance of amber eyes and
red-rose loveliness of cheeks she must look pale and dark and
insignificant. Of course Teddy was in love with Ilse. He had gone
to see her first&mdash;had been with her while Emily waited for him
in the garden. Well, it made no real difference. Why should it? She
would be just as friendly as ever. And was. Friendly with a
vengeance. But when Teddy and Ilse had
gone&mdash;together&mdash;laughing and teasing each other through
the old To-morrow Road Emily went up to her room and locked the
door. Nobody saw her again until the next morning.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>The gay two weeks of Ilse's planning followed. Picnics, dances
and jamborees galore. Shrewsbury society decided that a rising
young artist was somebody to be taken notice of and took notice
accordingly. It was a veritable whirl of gaiety and Emily whirled
about in it with the others. No step lighter in the dance, no voice
quicker in the jest, and all the time feeling like the miserable
spirit in a ghost story she had once read who had a live coal in
its breast instead of a heart. All the time, feeling, too, far down
under surface pride and hidden pain, that sense of completion and
fulfilment which always came to her when Teddy was near her. But
she took good care never to be alone with Teddy, who certainly
could not be accused of any attempt to inveigle her into twosomes.
His name was freely coupled with Ilse's and they took so composedly
the teasing they encountered, that the impression gained ground
that "things were pretty well understood between them." Emily
thought Ilse might have told her if it were so. But Ilse, though
she told many a tale of lovers forlorn whose agonies seemed to lie
very lightly on her conscience, never mentioned Teddy's name, which
Emily thought had a torturing significance of its own. She inquired
after Perry Miller, wanting to know if he were as big an oaf as
ever and laughing over Emily's indignant defence.</p>

<p>"He will be Premier some day no doubt," agreed Ilse scornfully.
"He'll work like the devil and never miss anything by lack of
asking for it, but won't you always smell the herring-barrels of
Stovepipe Town?"</p>

<p>Perry came to see Ilse, bragged a bit too much over his progress
and got so snubbed and manhandled that he did not come again.
Altogether the two weeks seemed a nightmare to Emily, who thought
she was unreservedly thankful when the time came for Teddy to go.
He was going on a sailing vessel to Halifax, wanting to make some
nautical sketches for a magazine, and an hour before flood-tide,
while the <i>Mira Lee</i> swung at anchor by the wharf at Stovepipe
Town, he came to say good-bye. He did not bring Ilse with
him&mdash;no doubt, thought Emily, because Ilse was visiting in
Charlottetown; but Dean Priest was there, so there was no dreaded
solitude <i>a deux.</i> Dean was creeping back into his own, after
the two weeks' junketings from which he had been barred out. Dean
would not go to dances and clam-bakes, but he was always hovering
in the background, as everybody concerned felt. He stood with Emily
in the garden and there was a certain air of victory and possession
about him that did not escape Teddy's eye. Dean, who never made the
mistake of thinking gaiety was happiness, had seen more than others
of the little drama that had been played out in Blair Water during
those two weeks and the dropping of the curtain left him a
satisfied man. The old, shadowy, childish affair between Teddy Kent
of the Tansy Patch and Emily of New Moon, was finally ended.
Whatever its significance or lack of significance had been, Dean no
longer counted Teddy among his rivals.</p>

<p>Emily and Teddy parted with the hearty handshake and mutual good
wishes of old schoolmates who do indeed wish each other well but
have no very vital interest in the matter.</p>

<p>"Prosper and be hanged to you," as some old Murray had been wont
to say.</p>

<p>Teddy got himself away very gracefully. He had the gift of
making an artistic exit, but he did not once look back. Emily
turned immediately to Dean and resumed the discussion which Teddy's
coming had interrupted. Her lashes hid her eyes very securely.
Dean, with his uncanny ability to read her thoughts, should
not&mdash;must not guess&mdash;what? What was there to guess?
Nothing&mdash;absolutely nothing. Yet Emily kept her lashes
down.</p>

<p>When Dean, who had some other engagement that evening, went away
half an hour later she paced sedately up and down among the gold of
primroses for a little while, the very incarnation, in all seeming,
of maiden meditation fancy free.</p>

<p>"Spinning out a plot, no doubt," thought Cousin Jimmy proudly,
as he glimpsed her from the kitchen window. "It beats me how she
does it."</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>Perhaps Emily was spinning out a plot. But as the shadows
deepened she slipped out of the garden, through the dreamy peace of
the old columbine orchard&mdash;along the Yesterday Road&mdash;over
the green pasture field&mdash;past the Blair Water&mdash;up the
hill beyond&mdash;past the Disappointed House&mdash;through the
thick fir wood. There, in a clump of silver birches, one had an
unbroken view of the harbour, flaming in lilac and rose-colour.
Emily reached it a little breathlessly&mdash;she had almost run at
the last. Would she be to late? Oh, what if she should be too
late?</p>

<p>The <i>Mira Lee</i> was sailing out of the harbour, a dream
vessel in the glamour of sunset, past purple headlands and distant,
fairylike, misty coasts. Emily stood and watched her till she had
crossed the bar into the gulf beyond. Stood and watched her until
she had faded from sight in the blue dimness of the falling night,
conscious only of a terrible hunger to see Teddy once
more&mdash;just once more. To say good-bye as it should have been
said.</p>

<p>Teddy was gone. To another world. There was no rainbow in sight.
And what was Vega of the Lyre but a whirling, flaming, incredibly
distant sun?</p>

<p>She slipped down among the grasses at her feet and lay there
sobbing in the cold moonshine that had suddenly taken the place of
the friendly twilight.</p>

<p>Mingled with her sharp agony was incredulity. This thing could
not have happened. Teddy could no have gone away with only that
soulless, chilly, polite good-bye. After all their years of
comradeship, if nothing else. Oh, how would she ever get herself
past three o'clock this night?</p>

<p>"I am a hopeless fool," she whispered savagely. "He has
forgotten. I am nothing to him. And I deserve it. Didn't I forget
him in those crazy weeks when I was imagining myself in love with
Aylmer Vincent? Of course somebody has told him all about that.
I've lost my chance of real happiness through that absurd affair.
Where is my pride? To cry like this over a man who has forgotten
me. But&mdash;but&mdash;it's so nice to cry after having had to
laugh for these hideous weeks."</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>Emily flung herself into work feverishly after Teddy had gone.
Through long summer days and nights she wrote, while the purple
stains deepened under her eyes and the rose stains faded out of her
cheeks. Aunt Elizabeth thought she was killing herself and for the
first time was reconciled to her intimacy with Jarback Priest,
since he dragged Emily away from her desk in the evenings at least
for walks and talks in the fresh air. That summer Emily paid off
the last of her indebtedness to Uncle Wallace and Aunt Ruth with
her "pot-boilers."</p>

<p>But there was more than pot-boiling a-doing. In her first
anguish of loneliness, as she lay awake at three o'clock, Emily had
remembered a certain wild winter night when she and Ilse and Perry
and Teddy had been "stormed in" in the old John House on the Derry
Pond Road;* remembered all the scandal and suffering that had
arisen there-from; and remembered also that night of rapt delight
"thinking out" a story that had flashed into her mind at a certain
gay, significant speech of Teddy's. At least, she had thought it
significant then. Well, <i>that</i> was all over. But wasn't the
story somewhere? She had written the outline of that alluring,
fanciful tale in a Jimmy-book the next day. Emily sprang out of bed
in the still summer moonlight, lighted one of the famous candles of
New Moon, and rummaged through a pile of old Jimmy-books. Yes, here
it was. <i>A Seller of Dreams.</i> Emily squatted down on her
haunches and read it through. It was <i>good.</i> Again it seized
hold of her imagination and called forth all her creative impulse.
She would write it out&mdash;she would begin that very moment.
Flinging a dressing-gown over her white shoulders to protect them
from the keen gulf air she sat down before her open window and
began to write. Everything else was forgotten&mdash;for a time at
least&mdash;in the subtle, all-embracing joy of creation.</p>

<p>* See <i>Emily Climbs.</i></p>

<p>Teddy was nothing but a dim memory&mdash;love was a blown-out
candle. Nothing mattered but her story. The characters came to life
under her hand and swarmed through her consciousness, vivid,
alluring, compelling. Wit, tears, and laughter trickled from her
pen. She lived and breathed in another world and came back to New
Moon only at dawn to find her lamp burned out, and her table
littered with manuscript&mdash;the first four chapters of her book.
Her book! What magic and delight and awe and incredulity in the
thought.</p>

<p>For weeks Emily seemed to live really only when she was writing
it. Dean found her strangely rapt and remote, absent and
impersonal. Her conversation was as dull as it was possible for
Emily's conversation to be, and while her body sat or walked beside
him her soul was&mdash;where? In some region where he could not
follow, at all events. It had escaped him.</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p>Emily finished her book in six weeks&mdash;finished it at dawn
one morning. She flung down her pen and went to her window, lifting
her pale, weary, triumphant little face to the skies of
morning.</p>

<p>Music was dripping through the leafy silence in Lofty John's
bush. Beyond were dawn-rosy meadows and the garden of New Moon
living in an enchanted calm. The wind's dance over the hills seemed
some dear response to the music and rhythm in her being. Hills,
sea, shadows, all called to her with a thousand elfin voices of
understanding and acclaim. The old gulf was singing. Exquisite
tears were in her eyes. She had written it&mdash;oh, how happy she
was! This moment atoned for everything.</p>

<p>Finished&mdash;complete! There it lay&mdash;<i>A Seller of
Dreams</i>&mdash;her first book. Not a great book&mdash;oh, no, but
<i>hers</i>&mdash;her very own. Something to which she had given
birth, which would never have existed had she not brought it into
being. And it was <i>good.</i> She knew it was&mdash;felt it was. A
fiery, delicate tale, instinct with romance, pathos, humour. The
rapture of creation still illuminated it. She turned the pages
over, reading a bit here and there&mdash;wondering if she could
really have written <i>that.</i> She was right under the rainbow's
end. Could she not touch the magic, prismatic thing? Already her
fingers were clasping the pot of gold.</p>

<p>Aunt Elizabeth walked in with her usual calm disregard of any
useless formality such as knocking.</p>

<p>"Emily," she said severely, "have you been sitting up all night
<i>again</i>?"</p>

<p>Emily came back to earth with that abominable mental jolt which
can only be truly described as a thud&mdash;a "sickening thud" at
that. Very sickening. She stood like a convicted schoolgirl. And
<i>A Seller of Dreams</i> became instantly a mere heap of scribbled
paper.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I didn't realize how time was passing, Aunt Elizabeth,"
she stammered.</p>

<p>"You are old enough to have better sense," said Aunt Elizabeth.
"I don't mind your writing&mdash;now. You seem to be able to earn a
living by it in a very ladylike way. But you will wreck your health
if you keep this sort of thing up. Have you forgotten that your
mother died of consumption? At any rate, don't forget that you must
pick those beans to-day. It's high time they were picked."</p>

<p>Emily gathered up her manuscript with all her careless rapture
gone. Creation was over; remained now the sordid business of
getting her book published. Emily typewrote it on the little
third-hand machine Perry had picked up for her at an auction
sale&mdash;a machine that wrote only half of any capital letter and
wouldn't print the "m's" at all. She put the capitals and the "m's"
in afterwards with a pen and sent the MS. away to a publishing
firm. The publishing firm sent it back with a typewritten screed
stating that "their readers had found some merit in the story but
not enough to warrant an acceptance."</p>

<p>This "damning with faint praise" flattened Emily out as not even
a printed slip could have done. Talk about three o'clock that
night! No, it is an act of mercy not to talk about it&mdash;or
about many successive three o'clocks.</p>

<p>"Ambition!" wrote Emily bitterly in her diary. "I could laugh!
Where is my ambition now? What is it like to be ambitious? To feel
that life is before you, a fair, unwritten white page where you may
inscribe your name in letters of success? To feel that you have the
wish and power to win your crown? To feel that the coming years are
crowding to meet you and lay their largess at your feet? I
<i>once</i> knew what it was to feel so."</p>

<p>All of which goes to show how very young Emily still was. But
agony is none the less real because in later years when we have
learned that everything passes, we wonder what we agonized about.
She had a bad three weeks of it. Then she recovered enough to send
her story out again. This time the publisher wrote to her that he
might consider the book if she would make certain changes in it. It
was too "quiet." She must "pep it up." And the ending must be
changed entirely. It would never do.</p>

<p>Emily tore his letter savagely into bits. Mutilate and degrade
her story? Never! The very suggestion was an insult.</p>

<p>When a third publisher sent it back with a printed slip Emily's
belief in it died. She tucked it away and took up her pen
grimly.</p>

<p>"Well, I can write short stories at least. I must continue to do
that."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the book haunted her. After a few weeks she took
it out and reread it&mdash;coolly, critically, free alike from the
delusive glamour of her first rapture and from the equally delusive
depression of rejection slips. And still it seemed to her good. Not
quite the wonder-tale she had fancied it, perhaps; but still a good
piece of work. What then? No writer, so she had been told, was ever
capable of judging his own work correctly. If only Mr. Carpenter
were alive! He would tell her the truth. Emily made a sudden
terrible resolution. She would show it to Dean. She would ask for
his calm unprejudiced opinion and abide by it. It would be hard. It
was always hard to show her stories to any one, most of all to
Dean, who knew so much and had read everything in the world. But
she must <i>know.</i> And she knew Dean would tell her the truth,
good or bad. He thought nothing of her stories. But <i>this</i> was
different. Would he not see something worth while in this? If
not&mdash;</p>

<h3>VI</h3>

<p>"Dean, I want your candid opinion about this story. Will you
read it carefully, and tell me exactly what you think of it? I
don't want flattery&mdash;or false encouragement&mdash;I want the
truth&mdash;the naked truth."</p>

<p>"Are you so sure of that?" asked Dean dryly. "Very few people
can endure seeing the naked truth. It has to have a rag or two to
make it presentable."</p>

<p>"I <i>do</i> want the truth," said Emily stubbornly. "This book
has been"&mdash;she choked a little over the confession, "refused
three times. If you find any good in it I'll keep on trying to find
a publisher for it. If you condemn it I'll burn it."</p>

<p>Dean looked inscrutably at the little packet she held out to
him. So <i>this</i> was what had wrapped her away from him all
summer&mdash;absorbed her&mdash;possessed her. The one black drop
in his veins&mdash;that Priest jealousy of being
first&mdash;suddenly made its poison felt.</p>

<p>He looked into her cold, sweet face and starry eyes, grey-purple
as a lake at dawn, and hated whatever was in the packet, but he
carried it home and brought it back three nights later. Emily met
him in the garden, pale and tense.</p>

<p>"Well," she said.</p>

<p>Dean looked at her, guilty. How ivory white and exquisite she
was in the chill dusk!</p>

<p>"'Faithful are the wounds of a friend.' I should be less than
your friend if I told you falsehoods about this, Emily."</p>

<p>"So&mdash;it's no good."</p>

<p>"It's a pretty little story, Emily. Pretty and flimsy and
ephemeral as a rose-tinted cloud. Cobwebs&mdash;only cobwebs. The
whole conception is too far-fetched. Fairy tales are out of the
fashion. And this one of yours makes overmuch of a demand on the
credulity of the reader. And your characters are only puppets. How
could you write a real story? You've never <i>lived</i>."</p>

<p>Emily clenched her hands and bit her lips. She dared not trust
her voice to say a single word. She had not felt like this since
the night Ellen Greene had told her her father must die. Her heart,
that had beaten so tumultuously a few minutes ago, was like lead,
heavy and cold. She turned and walked away from him. He limped
softly after her and touched her shoulder.</p>

<p>"Forgive me, Star. Isn't it better to know the truth? Stop
reaching for the moon. You'll never get it. Why try to write,
anyway? Everything has already been written."</p>

<p>"Some day," said Emily, compelling herself to speak steadily, "I
may be able to thank you for this. To-night I hate you."</p>

<p>"Is that just?" asked Dean quietly.</p>

<p>"No, of course it isn't just," said Emily wildly. "Can you
expect me to be just when you've just killed me? Oh, I know I asked
for it&mdash;I know it's good for me. Horrible things always are
good for you, I suppose. After you've been killed a few times you
don't mind it. But the first time one does&mdash;squirm. Go away,
Dean. Don't come back for a week at least. The funeral will be over
then."</p>

<p>"Don't you believe I know what this means to you, Star?" asked
Dean pityingly.</p>

<p>"You can't&mdash;altogether. Oh, I know you're sympathetic. I
don't want sympathy. I only want time to bury myself decently."</p>

<p>Dean, knowing it would be better to go, went. Emily watched him
out of sight. Then she took up the little dog-eared, discredited
manuscript he had laid on the stone bench and went up to her room.
She looked it over by her window in the fading light. Sentence
after sentence leaped out at her&mdash;witty, poignant, beautiful.
No, that was only her fond, foolish, maternal delusion. There was
nothing of that sort in the book. Dean had said so. And her book
people. How she loved them. How real they seemed to her. It was
terrible to think of destroying them. But they were <i>not</i>
real. Only "puppets." Puppets would not mind being burned. She
glanced up at the starlit sky of the autumn night. Vega of the Lyre
shone bluely down upon her. Oh, life was an ugly, cruel, wasteful
thing!</p>

<p>Emily crossed over to her little fireplace and laid <i>A Seller
of Dreams</i> in the grate. She struck a match, knelt down and held
it to a corner with a hand that did not tremble. The flame seized
on the loose sheets eagerly, murderously. Emily clasped her hands
over her heart and watched it with dilated eyes, remembering the
time she had burned her old "account book" rather than let Aunt
Elizabeth see it. In a few moments the manuscript was a mass of
writhing fires&mdash;in a few more seconds it was a heap of
crinkled ashes, with here and there an accusing ghost-word coming
out whitely on a blackened fragment, as if to reproach her.</p>

<p>Repentance seized upon her. Oh, why had she done it? Why had she
burned her book? Suppose it was no good. Still, it was hers. It was
wicked to have burned it. She had destroyed something incalculably
precious to her. What did the mothers of old feel when their
children had passed through the fire to Moloch&mdash;when the
sacrificial impulse and excitement had gone? Emily thought she
knew.</p>

<p>Nothing of her book, her dear book that had seemed so wonderful
to her, but ashes&mdash;a little, pitiful heap of black ashes.
Could it be so? Where had gone all the wit and laughter and charm
that had seemed to glimmer in its pages&mdash;all the dear folks
who had lived in them&mdash;all the secret delight she had woven
into them as moonlight is woven among pines? Nothing left but
ashes. Emily sprang up in such an anguish of regret that she could
not endure it. She must get out&mdash;away&mdash;anywhere. Her
little room, generally so dear and beloved and cosy, seemed like a
prison. Out&mdash;somewhere&mdash;into the cold, free autumn night
with its grey ghost-mists&mdash;away from walls and
boundaries&mdash;away from that little heap of dark flakes in the
grate&mdash;away from the reproachful ghosts of her murdered book
folks. She flung open the door of the room and rushed blindly to
the stair.</p>

<h3>VII</h3>

<p>Aunt Laura never to the day of her death forgave herself for
leaving that mending-basket at the head of the stair. She had never
done such a thing in her life before. She had been carrying it up
to her room when Elizabeth called peremptorily from the kitchen
asking where something was. Laura set her basket down on the top
step and ran to get it. She was away only a moment. But that moment
was enough for predestination and Emily. The tear-blinded girl
stumbled over the basket and fell&mdash;headlong down the long
steep staircase of New Moon. There was a moment of fear&mdash;a
moment of wonderment&mdash;she felt plunged into deadly
cold&mdash;she felt plunged into burning heat&mdash;she felt a
soaring upward&mdash;a falling into unseen depths&mdash;a fierce
stab of agony in her foot&mdash;then nothing more. When Laura and
Elizabeth came running in there was only a crumpled silken heap
lying at the foot of the stairs with balls and stockings all around
it and Aunt Laura's scissors bent and twisted under the foot they
had so cruelly pierced.</p>

<hr><h2><a name="C07" id="C07"><i>Chapter VII</i></a>
</h2>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>From October to April Emily Starr lay in bed or on the
sitting-room lounge watching the interminable windy drift of clouds
over the long white hills or the passionless beauty of winter trees
around quiet fields of snow, and wondering if she would ever walk
again&mdash;or walk only as a pitiable cripple. There was some
obscure injury to her back upon which the doctors could not agree.
One said it was negligible and would right itself in time. Two
others shook their heads and were afraid. But all were agreed about
the foot. The scissors had made two cruel wounds&mdash;one by the
ankle, one on the sole of the foot. Blood-poisoning set in. For
days Emily hovered between life and death, then between the
scarcely less terrible alternative of death and amputation. Aunt
Elizabeth prevented that. When all the doctors agreed that it was
the only way to save Emily's life she said grimly that it was not
the Lord's will, as understood by the Murrays, that people's limbs
should be cut off. Nor could she be removed from this position.
Laura's tears and Cousin Jimmy's pleadings and Dr. Burnley's
execrations and Dean Priest's agreements budged her not a jot.
Emily's foot should not be cut off. Nor was it. When she recovered
unmaimed Aunt Elizabeth was triumphant and Dr. Burnley
confounded.</p>

<p>The danger of amputation was over, but the danger of lasting and
bad lameness remained. Emily faced that all winter.</p>

<p>"If I only <i>knew</i> one way or the other," she said to Dean.
"If I <i>knew,</i> I could make up my mind to bear
it&mdash;perhaps. But to lie here&mdash;wondering&mdash;wondering
if I'll ever be well."</p>

<p>"You will be well," said Dean savagely.</p>

<p>Emily did not know what she would have done without Dean that
winter. He had given up his invariable winter trip and stayed in
Blair Water that he might be near her. He spent the days with her,
reading, talking, encouraging, sitting in the silence of perfect
companionship. When he was with her Emily felt that she might even
be able to face a lifetime of lameness. But in the long nights when
everything was blotted out by pain she could not face it. Even when
there was no pain her nights were often sleepless and very terrible
when the wind wailed drearily about the old New Moon eaves or
chased flying phantoms of snow over the hills. When she slept she
dreamed, and in her dreams she was for ever climbing stairs and
could never get to the top of them, lured upward by an odd little
whistle&mdash;two higher notes and a low one&mdash;that ever
retreated as she climbed. It was better to lie awake than have that
terrible, recurrent dream. Oh, those bitter nights! Once Emily had
not thought that the Bible verse declaring that there would be no
night in heaven contained an attractive promise. No night? No soft
twilight enkindled with stars? No white sacrament of moonlight? No
mystery of velvet shadow and darkness? No ever-amazing miracle of
dawn? Night was as beautiful as day and heaven would not be perfect
without it.</p>

<p>But now in these dreary weeks of pain and dread she shared the
hope of the Patmian seer. Night was a dreadful thing.</p>

<p>People said Emily Starr was very brave and patient and
uncomplaining. But she did not seem so to herself. They did not
know of the agonies of rebellion and despair and cowardice behind
her outward calmness of Murray pride and reserve. Even Dean did not
know&mdash;though perhaps he suspected.</p>

<p>She smiled gallantly when smiling was indicated, but she never
laughed. Not even Dean could make her laugh, though he tried with
all the powers of wit and humour at his command.</p>

<p>"My days of laughter are done," Emily said to herself. And her
days of creation as well. She could never write again. The "flash"
never came. No rainbow spanned the gloom of that terrible winter.
People came to see her continuously. She wished they would stay
away. Especially Uncle Wallace and Aunt Ruth, who were sure she
would never walk again and said so every time they came. Yet they
were not so bad as the callers who were cheerfully certain she
would be all right in time and did not believe a word of it
themselves. She had never had any intimate friends except Dean and
Ilse and Teddy. Ilse wrote weekly letters in which she rather too
obviously tried to cheer Emily up. Teddy wrote once when he heard
of her accident. The letter was very kind and tactful and sincerely
sympathetic. Emily thought it was the letter any indifferent
friendly acquaintance might have written and she did not answer it
though he had asked her to let him know how she was getting on. No
more letters came. There was nobody but Dean. He had never failed
her&mdash;never would fail her. More and more as the interminable
days of storm and gloom passed she turned to him. In that winter of
pain she seemed to herself to grow so old and wise that they met on
equal ground at last. Without him life was a bleak, grey desert
devoid of colour or music. When he came the desert would&mdash;for
a time at least&mdash;blossom like the rose of joy and a thousand
flowerets of fancy and hope and illusion would fling their garlands
over it.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>When spring came Emily got well&mdash;got well so suddenly and
quickly that even the most optimistic of the three doctors was
amazed. True, for a few weeks she had to limp about on a crutch,
but the time came when she could do without it&mdash;could walk
alone in the garden and look out on the beautiful world with eyes
that could not be satisfied with seeing. Oh, how good life was
again! How good the green sod felt beneath her feet! She had left
pain and fear behind her like a cast-off garment and felt
gladness&mdash;no, not gladness exactly, but the possibility of
being glad once more sometime.</p>

<p>It was worth while to have been ill to realize the savour of
returning health and well-being on a morning like this, when a
sea-wind was blowing up over the long, green fields. There was
nothing on earth like a sea-wind. Life might, in some ways, be a
thing of shreds and tatters, everything might be changed or gone;
but pansies and sunset clouds were still fair. She felt again her
old joy in mere existence.</p>

<p>"'Truly the light is sweet and a pleasant thing it is for the
eye to behold the sun,'" she quoted dreamily.</p>

<p>Old laughter came back. On the first day that Emily's laughter
was heard again in New Moon Laura Murray, whose hair had turned
from ash to snow that winter, went to her room and knelt down by
her bed to thank God. And while she knelt there Emily was talking
about God to Dean in the garden on one of the most beautiful spring
twilights imaginable, with a little, growing moon in the midst of
it.</p>

<p>"There have been times this past winter when I felt God hated
me. But now again I feel sure He loves me," she said softly.</p>

<p>"So sure?" questioned Dean dryly. "<i>I</i> think God is
interested in us but He doesn't love us. He likes to watch us to
see what we'll do. Perhaps it amuses Him to see us squirm."</p>

<p>"What a horrible conception of God!" said Emily with a shudder.
"You don't really believe that about Him, Dean."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Because He would be worse than a devil then&mdash;a God who
thought only about his own amusement, without even the devil's
justification of hating us."</p>

<p>"Who tortured you all winter with bodily pain and mental
anguish?" asked Dean.</p>

<p>"Not God. And He&mdash;sent me <i>you</i>," said Emily steadily.
She did not look at him; she lifted her face to the Three
Princesses in their Maytime beauty&mdash;a white-rose face now,
pale from its winter's pain. Beside her the big spirea, which was
the pride of Cousin Jimmy's heart, banked up in its June-time snow,
making a beautiful background for her. "Dean, how can I ever thank
you for what you've done for me&mdash;been to me&mdash;since last
October? I can never put it in words. But I want you to know how I
feel about it."</p>

<p>"I've done nothing except snatch at happiness. Do you know what
happiness it was to me to do something for you Star&mdash;help you
in some way&mdash;to see you turning to me in your pain for
something that only I could give&mdash;something I had learned in
my own years of loneliness? And to let myself dream something that
couldn't come true&mdash;that I knew ought not to come
true&mdash;"</p>

<p>Emily trembled and shivered slightly. Yet why hesitate&mdash;why
put off that which she had fully made up her mind to do?</p>

<p>"Are you so sure, Dean," she said in a low tone, "that your
dream&mdash;can't come true?"</p>

<hr><h2><a name="C08" id="C08"><i>Chapter VIII</i></a>
</h2>

<p><i>&nbsp;</i>
</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>There was a tremendous sensation in the Murray clan when Emily
announced that she was going to marry Dean Priest. At New Moon the
situation was very tense for a time. Aunt Laura cried and Cousin
Jimmy went about shaking his head and Aunt Elizabeth was
exceedingly grim. Yet in the end they made up their minds to accept
it. What else could they do? By this time even Aunt Elizabeth
realized that when Emily said she was going to do a thing she would
do it</p>

<p>"You would have made a worse fuss if I had told you I was going
to marry Perry of Stovepipe Town," said Emily when she had heard
all Aunt Elizabeth had to say.</p>

<p>"Of course that is true enough," admitted Aunt Elizabeth when
Emily had gone out. "And, after all, Dean is well-off&mdash;and the
Priests are a good family."</p>

<p>"But so&mdash;so <i>Priesty,"</i> sighed Laura. "And Dean is
far, far too old for Emily. Besides, his great-great-grandfather
went insane."</p>

<p>"Dean won't go insane."</p>

<p>"His children might."</p>

<p>"Laura," said Elizabeth rebukingly, and dropped the subject.</p>

<p>"Are you very sure you love him, Emily?" Aunt Laura asked that
evening.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;in a way," said Emily.</p>

<p>Aunt Laura threw out her hands and spoke with a sudden passion
utterly foreign to her.</p>

<p>"But there's only one way of loving."</p>

<p>"Oh no, dearest of Victorian aunties," answered Emily gaily.
"There are a dozen different ways. <i>You</i> know I've tried one
or two ways already. And they failed me. Don't worry about Dean and
me. We understand each other perfectly."</p>

<p>"I only want you to be happy, dear."</p>

<p>"And I will be happy&mdash;I am happy. I'm not a romantic little
dreamer any longer. Last winter took that all out of me. I'm going
to marry a man whose companionship satisfies me absolutely and he's
quite satisfied with what I can give him&mdash;real affection and
comradeship. I am sure that is the best foundation for a happy
marriage. Besides, Dean <i>needs</i> me. I can make him happy. He
has never been happy. Oh, it is delightful to feel that you hold
happiness in your hand and can hold it out, like a pearl beyond
price, to one who longs for it."</p>

<p>"You're too young," reiterated Aunt Laura.</p>

<p>"It's only my body that's young. My soul is a hundred years old.
Last winter made me feel so old and wise. <i>You</i> know."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know." But Laura also knew that this very feeling old
and wise merely proved Emily's youth. People who <i>are</i> old and
wise never feel either. And all this talk of aged souls didn't do
away with the fact that Emily, slim, radiant, with eyes of mystery,
was not yet twenty, while Dean Priest was forty-two. In fifteen
years&mdash;but Laura would not think of it.</p>

<p>And, after all, Dean would not take her away. There <i>had</i>
been happy marriages with just as much disparity of age.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>Nobody, it must be admitted, seemed to regard the match with
favour. Emily had a rather abominable time of it for a few weeks.
Dr. Burnley raged about the affair and insulted Dean. Aunt Ruth
came over and made a scene.</p>

<p>"He's an infidel, Emily."</p>

<p>"He isn't!" said Emily indignantly.</p>

<p>"Well, he doesn't believe what <i>we</i> believe," declared Aunt
Ruth as if that ought to settle the matter for any true Murray.</p>

<p>Aunt Addie, who had never forgiven Emily for refusing her son,
even though Andrew was now happily and suitably, <i>most</i>
suitably, married, was very hard to bear. She contrived to make
Emily feel a most condescending pity. She had lost Andrew, so must
console herself with lame Jarback Priest. Of course Aunt Addie did
not put it in so many blunt words but she might as well have. Emily
understood her implications perfectly.</p>

<p>"Of course, he's richer than a <i>young</i> man could be,"
conceded Aunt Addie.</p>

<p>"And interesting," said Emily. "Most young men are <i>such</i>
bores. They haven't lived long enough to learn that they are not
the wonders to the world they are to their mothers."</p>

<p>So honours were about even <i>there.</i></p>

<p>The Priests did not like it any too well either. Perhaps because
they did not care to see a rich uncle's possessions thus slipping
through the fingers of hope. They said Emily Starr was just
marrying Dean for his money, and the Murrays took care that she
should hear they had said it. Emily felt that the Priests were
continually and maliciously discussing her behind her back.</p>

<p>"I'll never feel at home in your clan," she told Dean
rebelliously.</p>

<p>"Nobody will ask you to. You and I, Star, are going to live unto
ourselves. We are not going to walk or talk or think or breathe
according to any clan standard, be it Priest or Murray. If the
Priests disapprove of you as a wife for me the Murrays still more
emphatically disapprove of me as a husband for you. Never mind. Of
course the Priests find it hard to believe that you are marrying me
because you care anything for me. How could you? I find it hard to
believe myself."</p>

<p>But you <i>do</i> believe it, Dean? Truly I care more for you
than any one in the world. Of course&mdash;I told you&mdash;I don't
love you like a silly, romantic girl."</p>

<p>"Do you love any one else?" asked Dean quietly. It was the first
time he had ventured to ask the question.</p>

<p>"No. Of course&mdash;you know&mdash;I've had one or two
broken-backed love affairs&mdash;silly schoolgirl fancies. That is
all years behind me. Last winter seems like a
lifetime&mdash;dividing me by centuries from those old follies. I'm
all yours, Dean."</p>

<p>Dean lifted the hand he held and kissed it. He had never yet
touched her lips.</p>

<p>"I can make you happy, Star. I know it. Old&mdash;lame as I am,
I can make you happy. I've been waiting for you all my life, my
star. That's what you've always seemed to me, Emily. An exquisite,
unreachable star. Now I have you&mdash;hold you&mdash;wear you on
my heart. And you will love me yet&mdash;some day you will give me
more than affection."</p>

<p>The passion in his voice startled Emily a little. It seemed in
some way to demand more of her than she had to give. And Ilse, who
had graduated from the School of Oratory and had come home for a
week before going on a summer concert tour, struck another note of
warning that disturbed faintly for a time.</p>

<p>"In some ways, honey, Dean is just the man for you. He's clever
and fascinating and not so horribly conscious of his own importance
as most of the Priests. But you'll belong to him body and soul.
Dean can't bear any one to have any interest outside of him. He
must possess exclusively. If you don't mind that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't think I do."</p>

<p>"Your writing&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm done with <i>that.</i> I seem to have no interest in it
since my illness. I saw&mdash;then&mdash;how little it really
mattered&mdash;how many more important things there
were&mdash;"</p>

<p>"As long as you feel like that you'll be happy with Dean.
Heigh-ho." Ilse sighed and pulled the blood-red rose that was
pinned to her waist to pieces. "It makes me feel fearfully old and
wise to be talking like this of your getting married, Emily. It
seems so&mdash;absurd in some ways. Yesterday we were schoolgirls.
To-day you're engaged. To-morrow&mdash;you'll be a
grandmother."</p>

<p>"Aren't you&mdash;isn't there anybody in your own life,
Ilse?"</p>

<p>"Listen to the fox that lost her tail. No, thank you.
Besides&mdash;one might as well be frank. I feel an awful mood of
honest confession on me. There's never been anybody for me but
Perry Miller. And you've got your claws in him."</p>

<p>Perry Miller. Emily could not believe her ears.</p>

<p>"Ilse Burnley! You've always laughed at him&mdash;raged at
him&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Of course I did. I liked him so much that it made me furious to
see him making a fool of himself. I wanted to be proud of him and
he always made me ashamed of him. Oh, there were times when he made
me mad enough to bite the leg off a chair. If I hadn't cared, do
you suppose it would have mattered what kind of a donkey he was? I
can't get over it&mdash;the 'Burnley sotness,' I suppose. We never
change. Oh, I'd have jumped at him&mdash;would
yet&mdash;herring-barrels, Stovepipe Town and all. There you have
it. But never mind. Life is very decent without him."</p>

<p>"Perhaps&mdash;some day&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't dream it. Emily, I won't have you setting about making
matches for me. Perry never gave me two thoughts&mdash;never will.
I'm not going to think of him. What's that old verse we laughed
over once that last year in high school&mdash;thinking it was all
nonsense?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Since ever the world was spinning<br>
And till the world shall end<br>
You've your man in the beginning<br>
Or you have him in the end,<br>
But to have him from start to finish<br>
And neither to borrow nor lend<br>
Is what all of the girls are wanting<br>
And none of the gods can send.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>"Well, next year I'll graduate. For years after that a career.
Oh, I dare say I'll marry some day."</p>

<p>"Teddy?" said Emily, before she could prevent herself. She could
have bitten her tongue off the moment the word escaped it.</p>

<p>Ilse gave her a long, keen look, which Emily parried
successfully with all the Murray pride&mdash;too successfully,
perhaps.</p>

<p>"No, not Teddy. Teddy never thought about me. I doubt if he
thinks of any one but himself. Teddy's a duck but he's selfish,
Emily, he really is."</p>

<p>"No, no," indignantly. She could not listen to this.</p>

<p>"Well, we won't quarrel over it. What difference does it make if
he is? He's gone out of our lives anyway. The cat can have him.
He's going to climb to the top&mdash;they thought him a wow in
Montreal. He'll make a wonderful portrait painter&mdash;if he can
only cure himself of his old trick of putting <i>you</i> into all
the faces he paints."</p>

<p>"Nonsense. He doesn't&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He <i>does.</i> I've raged at him about it times without
number. Of course he denies it. I really think he's quite
unconscious of it himself. It's the hang-over from some old
unconscious emotion, I suppose&mdash;to use the jargon of modern
psychologists. Never mind. As I said, I mean to marry sometime.
When I'm tired of a career. It's very jolly <i>now</i>&mdash;but
some day. I'll make a sensible wedding o't, just as you're doing,
with a heart of gold and a pocket of silver. Isn't it funny to be
talking of marrying some man you've never even seen? What is he
doing at this very moment? Shaving&mdash;swearing&mdash;breaking
his heart over some other girl? Still, he's to marry <i>me.</i> Oh,
we'll be happy enough, too. And we'll visit each other, you and
I&mdash;and compare our children&mdash;call your first girl Ilse,
won't you, friend of my heart&mdash;and&mdash;and what a devilish
thing it is to be a woman, isn't it, Emily?"</p>

<p>Old Kelly, the tin peddler, who had been Emily's friend of many
years, had to have his say about it, too. One could not suppress
Old Kelly.</p>

<p>"Gurrl dear, is it true that ye do be after going to marry
Jarback Praste?"</p>

<p>"Quite true." Emily knew it was of no use to expect Old Kelly to
call Dean anything but Jarback. But she always winced.</p>

<p>Old Kelly crabbed his face.</p>

<p>"Ye're too young at the business of living to be marrying any
one&mdash;laste of all a Praste."</p>

<p>"Haven't you been twitting me for years with my slowness in
getting a beau?" asked Emily shyly.</p>

<p>"Gurrl dear, a joke is a joke. But this is beyond joking. Don't
be pig-headed now, there's a jewel. Stop a bit and think it over.
There do be some knots mighty aisy to tie but the untying is a cat
of a different brade. I've always been warning ye against marrying
a Praste. 'Twas a foolish thing&mdash;I might av known it. I should
've towld ye to marry one."</p>

<p>"Dean isn't like the other Priests, Mr. Kelly. I'm going to be
very happy."</p>

<p>Old Kelly shook his bushy, reddish grey head incredulously.</p>

<p>"Then you'll be the first Praste woman that ever was, not aven
laving out the ould Lady at the Grange. But <i>she</i> liked a
fight every day. It'll be the death av you."</p>

<p>"Dean and I won't fight&mdash;at least not every day." Emily was
having some fun to herself. Old Kelly's gloomy predictions did not
worry her. She took rather an impish delight in egging him on.</p>

<p>"Not if ye give him his own way. He'll sulk if ye don't. All the
Prastes sulk if they don't get it. And he'll be that
jealous&mdash;ye'll never dare spake to another man. Oh, the
Prastes rule their wives. Old Aaron Praste made his wife go down on
her knees whenever she had a little favour to ask. Me feyther saw
it wid his own eyes."</p>

<p>"Mr. Kelly, do you really suppose <i>any</i> man could make
<i>me</i> do that?"</p>

<p>Old Kelly's eyes twinkled in spite of himself.</p>

<p>"The Murray knee jints do be a bit stiff for that," he
acknowledged, "But there's other things. Do ye be after knowing
that his Uncle Jim never spoke when he could grunt and always said
'Ye fool' to his wife when she conterdicted him."</p>

<p>"But perhaps she <i>was</i> a fool, Mr. Kelly."</p>

<p>"Mebbe. But was it polite? I lave it to ye. And his father threw
the dinner dishes at his wife whin she made him mad. 'Tis a fact,
I'm telling you. Though the old divil <i>was</i> amusing when he
was pleased."</p>

<p>"That sort of thing always skips a generation," said Emily. "And
if not&mdash;I can dodge."</p>

<p>"Gurrl dear, there do be worse things than having a dish or two
flung at ye. Ye <i>kin</i> dodge them. But there's things ye can't
dodge. Tell me now, do ye know"&mdash;Old Kelly lowered his voice
ominously&mdash;"that 'tis said the Prastes do often get tired av
bein' married to the wan woman."</p>

<p>Emily was guilty of giving Mr. Kelly one of the smiles Aunt
Elizabeth had always disapproved of.</p>

<p>"Do you really think Dean will get tired of me? I'm not
beautiful, dear Mr. Kelly, but I am very interesting."</p>

<p>Old Kelly gathered up his lines with the air of a man who
surrenders at discretion.</p>

<p>"Well, gurrl dear, ye do be having a good mouth for kissing,
anyway. I see ye're set on it. But I do be thinking the Lord
intended ye for something different. Anyway, here's hoping we'll
all make a good end. But he knows too much, that Jarback Praste,
he's after knowing far too much."</p>

<p>Old Kelly drove off, waiting till he was decently out of earshot
to mutter:</p>

<p>"Don't it bate hell? And him as odd-looking as a cross-eyed
cat!"</p>

<p>Emily stood still for a few minutes looking after Old Kelly's
retreating chariot. He had found the one joint in her armour and
the thrust had struck home. A little chill crept over her as if a
wind from the grave had blown across her spirit. All at once an
old, old story whispered long ago by Great-aunt Nancy to Caroline
Priest flashed into her recollection. Dean, so it was said, had
seen the Black Mass celebrated.</p>

<p>Emily shook the recollection from her. <i>That</i> was all
nonsense&mdash;silly, malicious, envious gossip of stay-at-homes.
But Dean <i>did</i> know too much. He had eyes that had seen too
much. In a way that had been part of the distinct fascination he
had always had for Emily. But now it frightened her. Had she not
always felt&mdash;did she not still feel&mdash;that he always
seemed to be laughing at the world from some mysterious standpoint
of inner knowledge&mdash;a knowledge she did not share&mdash;could
not share&mdash;did not, to come down to the bare bones of it, want
to share? He had lost some intangible, all-real zest of faith and
idealism. It was there deep in her heart&mdash;an inescapable
conviction, thrust it out of sight as she might. For a moment she
felt with Ilse that it was a decidedly devilish thing to be a
woman.</p>

<p>"It serves me right for bandying words with Old Jock Kelly on
such a subject," she thought angrily.</p>

<p>Consent was never given in set terms to Emily's engagement. But
the thing came to be tacitly accepted. Dean was well-to-do. The
Priests had all the necessary traditions, including that of a
grandmother who had danced with the Prince of Wales at the famous
ball in Charlottetown. After all, there would be a certain relief
in seeing Emily safely married.</p>

<p>"He won't take her far away from us," said Aunt Laura, who could
have reconciled herself to almost anything for that. How could they
lose the one bright, gay thing in that faded house?</p>

<p>"Tell Emily," wrote old Aunt Nancy, "that twins run in the
Priest family."</p>

<p>But Aunt Elizabeth did not tell her.</p>

<p>Dr. Burnley, who had made the most fuss, gave in when he heard
that Elizabeth Murray was overhauling the chests of quilts in the
attic of New Moon and that Laura was hemstitching table linen.</p>

<p>"Those whom Elizabeth Murray has joined together let no man put
asunder," he said resignedly.</p>

<p>Aunt Laura cupped Emily's face in her gentle hands and looked
deep into her eyes. "God bless you, Emily, dear child."</p>

<p>"Very mid-Victorian," commented Emily to Dean. "But I liked
it."</p>

<hr><h2><a name="C09" id="C09"><i>Chapter IX</i></a>
</h2>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>On one point Aunt Elizabeth was adamant Emily should not be
married until she was twenty. Dean, who had dreamed of an autumn
wedding and a winter spent in a dreamy Japanese garden beyond the
western sea, gave in with a bad grace. Emily, too, would have
preferred an earlier bridal. In the back of her mind, where she
would not even glance at it, was the feeling that the sooner it was
over and made irrevocable, the better.</p>

<p>Yet she was happy, as she told herself very often and very
sincerely. Perhaps there <i>were</i> dark moments when a
disquieting thought stared her in the face&mdash;it was but a
crippled, broken-winged happiness&mdash;not the wild, free-flying
happiness she had dreamed of. But that, she reminded herself, was
lost to her for ever.</p>

<p>One day Dean appeared before her with a flush of boyish
excitement on his face.</p>

<p>"Emily, I've been and gone and done something. Will you approve?
Oh, Lord, what will I do if you don't approve."</p>

<p>"What is it you've done?"</p>

<p>"I've bought me a house."</p>

<p>"A house!"</p>

<p>"A house! I, Dean Priest, am a landed proprietor&mdash;owning a
house, a garden and a spruce lot five acres in extent. I, who this
morning hadn't a square inch of earth to call my own. I, who all my
life have been hungry to own a bit of land."</p>

<p><i>"What</i> house have you bought, Dean?"</p>

<p>"Fred Clifford's house&mdash;at least the house he has always
owned by a legal quibble. Really <i>our</i>
house&mdash;appointed&mdash;foreordained for us since the
foundation of the world."</p>

<p>"The Disappointed House?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, that was your old name for it. But it isn't going to
be Disappointed any longer. That is&mdash;if&mdash;Emily, <i>do</i>
you approve of what I've done?"</p>

<p>"Approve? You're simply a darling, Dean. I've always loved that
house. It's one of those houses you love the minute you see them.
Some houses are like that, you know&mdash;full of magic. And others
have nothing at all of it in them. I've always longed to see that
house fulfilled. Oh&mdash;and somebody told me you were going to
buy that big horrible house at Shrewsbury. I was afraid to ask if
it were true."</p>

<p>"Emily, take back those words. You knew it wasn't true. You knew
me better. Of course, all the Priests wanted me to buy that house.
My dear sister was almost in tears because I wouldn't. It was to be
had at a bargain&mdash;and it was <i>such</i> an elegant
house."</p>

<p>"It <i>is</i> elegant&mdash;with all the word implies," agreed
Emily. "But it's an impossible house&mdash;not because of its size
or its elegance but just because of its impossibility."</p>

<p>"E-zackly. Any proper woman would feel the same. I'm so glad
you're pleased, Emily. I had to buy Fred's house yesterday in
Charlottetown&mdash;without waiting to consult you&mdash;another
man was on the point of buying it, so I wired Fred instantly. Of
course, if you hadn't liked it I'd have sold it again. But I
<i>felt</i> you would. We'll make such a home of it, dear. I want a
home. I've had many habitations but no homes. I'll have it finished
and fixed up as beautifully as possible for you, Star&mdash;my Star
who is fit to shine in the palaces of kings."</p>

<p>"Let's go right up and look at it," said Emily. "I want to tell
it what is coming to it. I want to tell it it is going to
<i>live</i> at last."</p>

<p>"We'll go up and look at it and <i>in</i> it. I've got the key.
Got it from Fred's sister. Emily, I feel as if I'd reached up and
plucked the moon."</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>I've</i> picked a lapful of stars," cried Emily
gaily.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>They went up to the Disappointed House&mdash;through the old
orchard full of columbines and along the To-morrow Road, across a
pasture field, up a little slope of golden fern, and over an old
meandering fence with its longers bleached to a silvery grey, with
clusters of wild everlastings and blue asters in its corners, then
up the little winding, capricious path on the long fir hill, which
was so narrow they had to walk singly and where the air always
seemed so full of nice whispery sounds.</p>

<p>When they came to its end there was a sloping field before them,
dotted with little, pointed firs, windy, grassy, lovable. And on
top of it, surrounded by hill glamour and upland wizardry, with
great sunset clouds heaped up over it, the house&mdash;<i>their</i>
house.</p>

<p>A house with the mystery of woods behind it and around it,
except on the south side where the land fell away in a long hill
looking down on the Blair Water, that was like a bowl of dull gold
now, and across it to meadows of starry rest beyond and the Derry
Pond Hills that were as blue and romantic as the famous Alsatian
Mountains. Between the house and the view, but not hiding it, was a
row of wonderful Lombardy poplars.</p>

<p>They climbed the hill to the gate of a little enclosed
garden&mdash;a garden far older than the house which had been built
on the site of a little log cabin of pioneer days.</p>

<p>"That's a view I can live with," said Dean exultingly. "Oh, 'tis
a dear place this. The hill is haunted by squirrels, Emily. And
there are rabbits about. Don't you love squirrels and rabbits? And
there are any number of shy violets hereabouts in spring, too.
There is a little mossy hollow behind those young firs that is full
of violets in May&mdash;violets,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sweeter than lids of Emily's eyes<br>
Or Emily's breath.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Emily's a nicer name than Cytherea or Juno, <i>I</i> think. I
want you to notice especially that little gate over yonder. It
isn't really needed. It opens only into that froggy marsh beyond
the wood. But isn't it a gate? I love a gate like that&mdash;a
reasonless gate. It's full of promise. There <i>may</i> be
something wonderful beyond. A gate is always a mystery,
anyhow&mdash;it lures&mdash;it is a symbol. And listen to that bell
ringing somewhere in the twilight across the harbour. A bell in
twilight always has a magic sound&mdash;as if it came from
somewhere 'far far in fairyland.' There are roses in that far
corner&mdash;old-fashioned roses like sweet old songs set to
flowering. Roses white enough to lie in your white bosom, my sweet,
roses red enough to star that soft dark cloud of your hair. Emily,
do you know I'm a little drunk to-night&mdash;on the wine of life.
Don't wonder if I say crazy things."</p>

<p>Emily was very happy. The old, sweet garden seemed to be talking
to her as a friend in the drowsy, winking light. She surrendered
herself utterly to the charm of the place. She looked at the
Disappointed House adoringly. Such a dear <i>thoughtful</i> little
house. Not an old house&mdash;she liked it for that&mdash;an old
house knew too much&mdash;was haunted by too many feet that had
walked over its threshold&mdash;too many anguished or impassioned
eyes that had looked out of its windows. This house was ignorant
and innocent like herself. Longing for happiness. It should have
it. She and Dean would drive out the ghosts of things that never
happened. How sweet it would be to have a home of her very own.</p>

<p>"That house wants us as badly as we want it," she said.</p>

<p>"I love you when your tones soften and mute like that, Star,"
said Dean. "Don't ever talk so to any other man, Emily."</p>

<p>Emily threw him a glance of coquetry that very nearly made him
kiss her. He had never kissed her yet. Some subtle prescience
always told him she was not yet ready to be kissed. He might have
dared it there and then, in that hour of glamour that had
transmuted everything into terms of romance and charm&mdash;he
might even have won her wholly then. But he hesitated&mdash;and the
magic moment passed. From somewhere down the dim road behind the
spruces came laughter. Harmless, innocent laughter of children. But
it broke some faintly woven spell.</p>

<p>"Let us go in and see our house," said Dean. He led the way
across the wild-grown grasses to the door that opened into the
living-room. The key turned stiffly in the rusted lock. Dean took
Emily's hand and drew her in.</p>

<p>"Over your own threshold, sweet&mdash;"</p>

<p>He lifted his flashlight and threw a circle of shifting light
around the unfinished room, with its bare, staring, lathed walls,
its sealed windows, its gaping doorways, its empty
fireplace&mdash;no, not quite empty. Emily saw a little heap of
white ashes in it&mdash;the ashes of the fire she and Teddy had
kindled years ago that adventurous summer evening of
childhood&mdash;the fire by which they had sat and planned out
their lives together. She turned to the door with a little
shiver.</p>

<p>"Dean, it looks too ghostly and forlorn. I think I'd rather
explore it by daylight. The ghosts of things that never happened
are worse than the ghosts of things that did."</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>It was Dean's suggestion that they spend the summer finishing
and furnishing their house&mdash;doing everything possible
themselves and fixing it up exactly as they wanted it.</p>

<p>"Then we can be married in the spring&mdash;spend the summer
listening to temple bells tinkling over eastern sands&mdash;watch
Philae by moonlight&mdash;hear the Nile moaning by
Memphis&mdash;come back in the autumn, turn the key of our own
door&mdash;be at home."</p>

<p>Emily thought the programme delightful. Her aunts were dubious
about it&mdash;it didn't seem quite proper and respectable
really&mdash;people would talk terribly. And Aunt Laura was worried
over some old superstition that it wasn't lucky to furnish a house
<i>before</i> a wedding. Dean and Emily didn't care whether it was
respectable and lucky or not. They went ahead and did it.</p>

<p>Naturally they were overwhelmed with advice from every one in
the Priest and Murray clans&mdash;and took none of it. For one
thing, they wouldn't paint the Disappointed House&mdash;just
shingled it and left the shingles to turn woodsy grey, much to Aunt
Elizabeth's horror.</p>

<p>"It's only Stovepipe Town houses that aren't painted," she
said.</p>

<p>They replaced the old, unused, temporary board steps, left by
the carpenters thirty years before, with broad, red sandstones from
the shore. Dean had casement windows put in with diamond shaped
panes which Aunt Elizabeth warned Emily would be terrible things to
keep clean. And he added a dear little window over the front door
with a little roof over it like a shaggy eyebrow and in the
living-room they had a French window from which you could step
right out into the fir wood.</p>

<p>And Dean had jewels of closets and cupboards put in
everywhere.</p>

<p>"I'm not such a fool as to imagine that a girl can keep on
loving a man who doesn't provide her with proper cupboards," he
declared.</p>

<p>Aunt Elizabeth approved of the cupboards but thought they were
clean daft in regard to the wallpapers. Especially the living-room
paper. They should have had something cheerful there&mdash;flowers
or gold stripes; or even, as a vast concession to modernity, some
of those "landscape papers" that were coming in. But Emily insisted
on papering it with a shadowy grey paper with snowy pine branches
over it. Aunt Elizabeth declared she would as soon live in the
woods as in such a room. But Emily in this respect, as in all
others concerning her own dear house, was "as pig-headed as ever,"
so exasperated Aunt Elizabeth averred, quite unconscious that a
Murray was borrowing one of Old Kelly's expressions.</p>

<p>But Aunt Elizabeth was really very good. She dug up, out of long
undisturbed boxes and chests, china and silver belonging to her
stepmother&mdash;the things Juliet Murray would have had if she had
married in orthodox fashion a husband approved of her
clan&mdash;and gave them to Emily. There were some lovely things
among them&mdash;especially a priceless pink lustre jug and a
delightful old dinner-set of real willow-ware&mdash;Emily's
grandmother's own wedding-set. Not a piece was missing. And it had
shallow thin cups and deep saucers and scalloped plates and round,
fat, pobby tureens. Emily filled the built-in cabinet in the
living-room with it and gloated over it. There were other things
she loved too; a little gilt-framed oval mirror with a black cat on
top of it, a mirror that had so often reflected beautiful women
that it lent a certain charm to every face; and an old clock with a
pointed top and two tiny gilded spires on each side, a clock that
gave warning ten minutes before it struck, a gentlemanly clock
never taking people unawares. Dean wound it up but would not start
it.</p>

<p>"When we come home&mdash;when I bring you in here as bride and
queen, you shall start it going," he said.</p>

<p>It turned out, too, that the Chippendale sideboard and the
claw-footed mahogany table at New Moon were Emily's. And Dean had
no end of quaint delightful things picked up all over the
world&mdash;a sofa covered with striped silk that had been in the
Salon of a Marquise of the Old Regime, a lantern of wrought-iron
lace from an old Venetian palace to hang in the living-room, a
Shiraz rug, a prayer-rug from Damascus, brass andirons from Italy,
jades and ivories from China, lacquer bowls from Japan, a
delightful little green owl in Japanese china, a painted Chinese
perfume-bottle of agate which he had found in some weird place in
Mongolia, with the perfume of the east&mdash;which is never the
perfume of the west&mdash;clinging to it, a Chinese teapot with
dreadful golden dragons coiling over it&mdash;five-clawed dragons
whereby the initiated knew that it was of the Imperial cabinets. It
was part of the loot of the Summer Palace in the Boxer Rebellion,
Dean told Emily, but he would not tell her how it had come into his
possession.</p>

<p>"Not yet. Some day. There's a story about almost everything I've
put in this house."</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>They had a great day putting the furniture in the living-room.
They tried it in a dozen different places and were not satisfied
until they had found the absolutely right one. Sometimes they could
not agree about it and then they would sit on the floor and argue
it out. And if they couldn't settle it they got Daffy to pull
straws with his teeth and decide it that way. Daffy was always
around. Saucy Sal had died of old age and Daffy was getting stiff
and a bit cranky and snored dreadfully when he was sleeping, but
Emily adored him and would not go to the Disappointed House without
him. He always slipped up the hill path beside her like a grey
shadow dappled with dark.</p>

<p>"You love that old cat more than you do me, Emily," Dean once
said&mdash;jestingly yet with an undernote of earnest.</p>

<p>"I <i>have</i> to love him," defended Emily. "He's growing old.
<i>You</i> have all the years before us. And I must always have a
cat about. A house isn't a home without the ineffable contentment
of a cat with its tail folded about its feet. A cat gives mystery,
charm, suggestion. And you must have a dog."</p>

<p>"I've never cared to have a dog since Tweed died. But perhaps
I'll get one&mdash;an altogether different kind of a one. We'll
need a dog to keep your cats in order. Oh, isn't it nice to feel
that a place belongs to you?"</p>

<p>"It's far nicer to feel that you belong to a place," said Emily,
looking about her affectionately.</p>

<p>"Our house and we are going to be good friends," agreed
Dean.</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p>They hung their pictures one day. Emily brought her favourites
up, including the Lady Giovanna and Mona Lisa. These two were hung
in the corner between the windows.</p>

<p>"Where your writing-desk will be," said Dean. "And Mona Lisa
will whisper to you the ageless secret of her smile and you shall
put it in a story."</p>

<p>"I thought you didn't want me to write any more stories," said
Emily. "You've never seemed to like the fact of my writing."</p>

<p>"That was when I was afraid it would take you away from me. Now,
it doesn't matter. I want you to do just as pleases you."</p>

<p>Emily felt indifferent. She had never cared to take up her pen
since her illness. As the days passed she felt a growing distaste
to the thought of ever taking it up. To think of it meant to think
of the book she had burned; and <i>that</i> hurt beyond bearing.
She had ceased to listen for her "random word"&mdash;she was an
exile from her old starry kingdom.</p>

<p>"I'm going to hang old Elizabeth Bas by the fireplace," said
Dean. "'Engraving from a portrait by Rembrandt.' Isn't she a
delightful old woman, Star, in her white cap and tremendous white
ruff collar? And did you ever see such a shrewd, humorous,
complacent, slightly contemptuous old face?"</p>

<p>"I don't think I should want to have an argument with
Elizabeth," reflected Emily. "One feels that she is keeping her
hands folded under compulsion and might box your ears if you
disagreed with her."</p>

<p>"She has been dust for over a century," said Dean dreamily. "Yet
here she is living on this cheap reprint of Rembrandt's canvas. You
are expecting her to speak to you. And I feel, as you do, that she
wouldn't put up with any nonsense."</p>

<p>"But likely she has a sweetmeat stored away in some pocket of
her gown for you. That fine, rosy, wholesome old woman. <i>She</i>
ruled her family&mdash;not a doubt of it. Her husband did as she
told him&mdash;but never knew it."</p>

<p><i>"Had</i> she a husband?" said Dean doubtfully. "There's no
wedding-ring on her finger."</p>

<p>"Then she must have been a most delightful old maid," averred
Emily.</p>

<p>"What a difference between her smile and Mona Lisa's," said
Dean, looking from one to the other. "Elizabeth is tolerating
things&mdash;with just a hint of a sly, meditative cat about her.
But Mona Lisa's face has that everlasting lure and provocation that
drives men mad and writes scarlet pages on dim historical records.
La Gioconda would be a more stimulating sweetheart. But Elizabeth
would be nicer for an aunt."</p>

<p>Dean hung a little old miniature of his mother up over the
mantelpiece. Emily had never seen it before. Dean Priest's mother
had been a beautiful woman.</p>

<p>"But why does she look so sad?"</p>

<p>"Because she was married to a Priest," said Dean.</p>

<p>"Will I look sad?" teased Emily.</p>

<p>"Not if it rests with me," said Dean.</p>

<p>But did it? Sometimes that question forced itself on Emily, but
she would not answer it. She was very happy two-thirds of that
summer&mdash;which she told herself was a high average. But in the
other third were hours of which she never spoke to any
one&mdash;hours in which her soul felt caught in a trap&mdash;hours
when the great, green emerald winking on her finger seemed like a
fetter. And once she even took it off just to feel free for a
little while&mdash;a temporary escape for which she was sorry and
ashamed the next day, when she was quite sane and normal again,
contented with her lot and more interested than ever in her little
grey house, which meant so much to her&mdash;"more to me than Dean
does," she said to herself once in a three-o'clock moment of stark,
despairing honesty; and then refused to believe it next
morning.</p>

<h3>VI</h3>

<p>Old Great-aunt Nancy of Priest Pond died that summer, very
suddenly. "I'm tired of living. I think I'll stop," she said one
day&mdash;and stopped. None of the Murrays benefited by her will;
everything she had was left to Caroline Priest; but Emily got the
gazing-ball and the brass chessy-cat knocker and the gold
ear-rings&mdash;and the picture Teddy had done of her in
water-colours years ago. Emily put the chessy-cat on the front
porch door of the Disappointed House and hung the great silvery
gazing-ball from the Venetian lantern and wore the quaint old
ear-rings to many rather delightful pomps and vanities. But she put
the picture away in a box in the New Moon attic&mdash;a box that
held certain sweet, old, foolish letters full of dreams and
plans.</p>

<h3>VII</h3>

<p>They had glorious minutes of fun when they stopped to rest
occasionally. There was a robin's nest in the fir at the north
corner which they watched and protected from Daffy.</p>

<p>"Think of the music penned in this fragile, pale blue wall,"
said Dean, touching an egg one day. "Not the music of the moon
perhaps, but an earthlier, homelier music, full of wholesome
sweetness and the joy of living. This egg will some day be a robin,
Star, to whistle us blithely home in the afterlight."</p>

<p>They made friends with an old rabbit that often came hopping out
of the woods into the garden. They had a game as to who could count
the most squirrels in the daytime and the most bats in the evening.
For they did not always go home as soon as it got too dark to work.
Sometimes they sat out on their sandstone steps listening to the
melancholy loveliness of night-wind on the sea and watching the
twilight creep up from the old valley and the shadows waver and
flicker under the fir-trees and the Blair Water turning to a great
grey pool tremulous with early stars. Daff sat beside them,
watching everything with his great moonlight eyes, and Emily pulled
his ears now and then.</p>

<p>"One understands a cat a little better now. At all other times
he is inscrutable, but in the time of dusk and dew we can catch a
glimpse of the tantalizing secret of his personality."</p>

<p>"One catches a glimpse of all kinds of secrets now," said Dean.
"On a night like this I always think of the 'hills where spices
grow.' That line of the old hymn Mother used to sing has always
intrigued me&mdash;though I can't 'fly like a youthful hart or
roe.' Emily, I can see that you are getting your mouth in the
proper shape to talk about the colour we'll paint the woodshed.
Don't you do it. No one should talk paint when she's expecting a
moonrise. There'll be a wonderful one presently&mdash;I've arranged
for it. But if we <i>must</i> talk of furniture let's plan for a
few things we haven't got yet and <i>must</i> have&mdash;a canoe
for our boating trips along the Milky Way, for instance&mdash;a
loom for the weaving of dreams and a jar of pixy-brew for festal
hours. And can't we arrange to have the spring of Ponce de Leon
over in that corner? Or would you prefer a fount of Castaly? As for
your trousseau, have what you like in it but there <i>must</i> be a
gown of grey twilight with an evening star for your hair. Also one
trimmed with moonlight and a scarf of sunset cloud."</p>

<p>Oh, she liked Dean. <i>How</i> she liked him. If she could only
love him!</p>

<p>One evening she slipped up alone to see her little house by
moonlight. What a dear place it was. She saw herself there in the
future&mdash;flitting through the little rooms&mdash;laughing under
the firs&mdash;sitting hand in hand with Teddy at the
fireplace&mdash;Emily came to herself with a shock. With Dean, of
course, with Dean. A mere trick of the memory.</p>

<h3>VIII</h3>

<p>There came a September evening when everything was
done&mdash;even to the horseshoe over the door to keep the witches
out&mdash;even to the candles Emily had stuck all about the
living-room&mdash;a little, jolly, yellow candle&mdash;a full, red,
pugnacious candle&mdash;a dreamy, pale blue candle&mdash;a
graceless candle with aces of hearts and diamonds all over
it&mdash;a slim, dandyish candle.</p>

<p>And the result was good. There was a sense of harmony in the
house. The things in it did not have to become acquainted but were
good friends from the very start. They did not shriek at each
other. There was not a noisy room in the house.</p>

<p>"There's absolutely nothing more we can do," sighed Emily. "We
can't even <i>pretend</i> there's anything more to do."</p>

<p>"I suppose not," agreed Dean regretfully. Then he looked at the
fireplace where kindlings and pinewood were laid.</p>

<p>"Yes, there is," he cried. "How could we have forgotten it?
We've got to see if the chimney will draw properly. I'm going to
light that fire."</p>

<p>Emily sat down on the settee in the corner and when the fire
began to burn Dean came and sat beside her. Daffy lay stretched out
at their feet, his little striped flanks moving peacefully up and
down.</p>

<p>Up blazed the merry flames. They shimmered over the old
piano&mdash;they played irreverent hide-and-seek with Elizabeth
Bas' adorable old face&mdash;they danced on the glass doors of the
cupboard where the willow-ware dishes were; they darted through the
kitchen door and the row of brown and blue bowls Emily had ranged
on the dresser winked back at them.</p>

<p>"This is home," said Dean softly. "It's lovelier than I've ever
dreamed of its being. This is how we'll sit on autumn evenings all
our lives, shutting out the cold misty nights that come in from the
sea&mdash;just you and I alone with the firelight and the
sweetness. But sometimes we'll let a friend come in and share
it&mdash;sip of our joy and drink of our laughter. We'll just sit
here and think about it all&mdash;till the fire burns out."</p>

<p>The fire crackled and snapped. Daffy purred. The moon shone down
through the dance of the fir-boughs straight on them through the
windows. And Emily was thinking&mdash;could not help
thinking&mdash;of the time she and Teddy had sat there. The odd
part was that she did not think of him longingly or lovingly. She
just thought of him. Would she, she asked herself, in mingled
exasperation and dread, find herself thinking of Teddy when she was
standing up to be married to Dean?</p>

<p>When the fire had died down into white ashes Dean got up.</p>

<p>"It was worth while to have lived long dreary years for
this&mdash;and to live them again, if need be, looking back to it,"
he said, holding out his hand. He drew her nearer. What ghost came
between the lips that might have met? Emily turned away with a
sigh.</p>

<p>"Our happy summer is over, Dean."</p>

<p>"Our <i>first</i> happy summer," corrected Dean. But his voice
suddenly sounded a little tired.</p>

<hr><h2><a name="C10" id="C10"><i>Chapter X</i></a>
</h2>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>They locked the door of the Disappointed House one November
evening and Dean gave the key to Emily.</p>

<p>"Keep it till spring," he said, looking out over the quiet,
cold, grey fields across which a chilly wind was blowing. "We won't
come back here till then."</p>

<p>In the stormy winter that followed, the cross-lots path to the
little house was so heaped with drifts that Emily never went near
it. But she thought about it often and happily, waiting amid its
snows for spring and life and fulfilment. That winter was, on the
whole, a happy time. Dean did not go away and made himself so
charming to the older ladies of New Moon that they almost forgave
him for being Jarback Priest. To be sure, Aunt Elizabeth never
could understand more than half of his remarks and Aunt Laura put
down to his debit account the change in Emily. For she was changed.
Cousin Jimmy and Aunt Laura knew that, though no one else seemed to
notice it. Often there was an odd restlessness in her eyes. And
something was missing from her laughter. It was not so
quick&mdash;so spontaneous as of old. She was a woman before her
time, thought Aunt Laura with a sigh. Was that dreadful fall down
the New Moon stairs the only cause? <i>Was</i> Emily happy? Laura
dared not ask. <i>Did</i> she love Dean Priest whom she was going
to marry in June? Laura did not know; but she <i>did</i> know that
love is something that cannot be generated by any intellectual rule
o' thumb. Also that a girl who is as happy as an engaged girl
should be does not spend so many hours when she should be sleeping,
pacing up and down her room. This was not to be explained away on
the ground that Emily was thinking out stories, Emily had given up
writing. In vain Miss Royal wrote pleading and scolding letters
from New York. In vain Cousin Jimmy slyly laid a new Jimmy-book at
intervals on her desk. In vain Laura timidly hinted that it was a
pity not to keep on when you had made such a good start. Even Aunt
Elizabeth's contemptuous assertion that she had always known Emily
would get tired of it&mdash;"the Starr fickleness, you
see"&mdash;failed to sting Emily back to her pen. She could not
write&mdash;she would never try to write again.</p>

<p>"I've paid my debts and I've enough in the bank to get what Dean
calls my wedding doo-dabs. And you've crocheted two filet spreads
for me," she told Aunt Laura a little wearily and bitterly. "So
what does it matter?"</p>

<p>"Was it&mdash;your fall that took away your&mdash;your
ambition?" faltered poor Aunt Laura, voicing what had been her
haunting dread all winter.</p>

<p>Emily smiled and kissed her.</p>

<p>"No, darling. That had nothing to do with it. Why worry over a
simple, natural thing? Here I am, going to be married, with a
prospective house and husband to think about. Doesn't that explain
why I've ceased to care about&mdash;other things?"</p>

<p>It should have, but that evening Emily went out of the house
after sunset. Her soul was pining for freedom and she went out to
slip its leash for a little while. It had been an April day, warm
in the sun, cold in the shadow. You felt the coldness even amid the
sunlight warmth. The evening was chill. The sky was overcast with
wrinkled, grey clouds, save along the west where a strip of yellow
sky gleamed palely and in it, sad and fair, a new moon setting
behind a dark hill. No living creature but herself seemed abroad
and the cold shadows settling down over the withered fields lent to
the landscape of too-early spring an aspect inexpressibly dreary
and mournful. It made Emily feel hopeless, as if the best of life
already lay in the past. Externals always had a great influence
upon her&mdash;too great perhaps. Yet she was glad it was a dour
evening. Anything else would have insulted her mood. She heard the
sea shuddering beyond the dunes. An old verse from one of Roberts'
poems came into her head:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Grey rocks and greyer sea.<br>
And surf along the shore,<br>
And in my heart a name<br>
My lips shall speak no more.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nonsense! Weak, silly, sentimental nonsense. No more of it!</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>But that letter from Ilse that day. Teddy was coming home. He
was to sail on the <i>Flavian.</i> He was going to be home most of
the summer.</p>

<p>"If it could only have been all over&mdash;before he came,"
muttered Emily.</p>

<p>Always to be afraid of to-morrow? Content&mdash;even happy with
to-day&mdash;but always afraid of tomorrow. Was this to be her
life? And <i>why</i> that fear of to-morrow?</p>

<p>She had brought the key of the Disapppinted House with her. She
had not been in it since November and she wanted to see
it&mdash;beautiful, waiting, desirable. <i>Her</i> home. In its
charm and sanity vague, horrible fears and doubts would vanish. The
soul of that happy last summer would come back to her. She paused
at the garden gate to look lovingly at it&mdash;the dear little
house nestled under the old trees that sighed softly as they had
sighed to her childhood visions. Below, Blair Water was grey and
sullen. She loved Blair Water in all its changes&mdash;its sparkle
of summer, its silver of dusk, its miracle of moonlight, its
dimpled rings of rain. And she loved it now, dark and brooding.
There was somehow a piercing sadness in that sullen, waiting
landscape all around her&mdash;as if&mdash;the odd fancy crossed
her mind&mdash;as if it were <i>afraid</i> of spring. How this idea
of fear haunted her! She looked up beyond the spires of the
Lombardies on the hill. And in a sudden pale rift between the
clouds a star shone down on her&mdash;Vega of the Lyre.</p>

<p>With a shiver Emily hurriedly unlocked the door and stepped in.
The house seemed to be vacant&mdash;waiting for her. She fumbled
through the darkness to the matches she knew were on the
mantelpiece and lighted the tall, pale-green taper beside the
clock. The beautiful room glimmered out at her in the flickering
light&mdash;just as they had left it that last evening. There was
Elizabeth Bas, who could never have known the meaning of
fear&mdash;Mona Lisa, who mocked at it. But the Lady Giovanna, who
never turned her saintly profile to look squarely at you. Had she
ever known it&mdash;this subtle, secret fear that one could never
put in words?&mdash;that would be so ridiculous if one could put it
in words? Dean Priest's sad lovely mother. Yes, she had known fear;
it looked out of her pictured eyes now in that dim, furtive
light.</p>

<p>Emily shut the door and sat down in the armchair beneath
Elizabeth Bas' picture. She could hear the dead, dry leaves of a
dead summer rustling eerily on the beech just outside the window.
And the wind&mdash;rising&mdash;rising&mdash;rising. But she liked
it. "The wind is free&mdash;not a prisoner like me." She crushed
the unbidden thought down sternly. She would <i>not</i> think such
things. Her fetters were of her own forging. She had put them on
willingly, even desirously. Nothing to do but wear them
gracefully.</p>

<p>How the sea moaned down there below the fields! But here in the
little house what a silence there was! Something strange and
uncanny about the silence. It seemed to hold some profound meaning.
She would not have dared to speak lest <i>something</i> should
answer her. Yet fear suddenly left her. She felt
dreamy&mdash;happy&mdash;far away from life and reality. The walls
of the shadowy room seemed slowly to fade from her vision. The
pictures withdrew themselves. There seemed to be nothing before her
but Great-aunt-Nancy's gazing-ball hung from the old iron
lantern&mdash;a big, silvery, gleaming globe. In it she saw the
reflected room, like a shining doll's-house, with herself sitting
in the old, low chair and the taper on the mantelpiece like a tiny,
impish star. Emily looked at it as she leaned back in her
chair&mdash;looked at it till she saw nothing but that tiny point
of light in a great misty universe.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>Did she sleep? Dream? Who knows? Emily herself never knew. Twice
before in her life&mdash;once in delirium*&mdash;once in sleep**
she had drawn aside the veil of sense and time and seen beyond.
Emily never liked to remember those experiences. She forgot them
deliberately. She had not recalled them for years. A dream&mdash;a
fancy fever-bred. But this?</p>

<p>* See <i>Emily of New Moon.</i> ** See <i>Emily Climbs.</i></p>

<p>A small cloud seemed to shape itself within the gazing-ball. It
dispersed&mdash;faded. But the reflected doll's-house in the ball
was gone. Emily saw an entirely different scene&mdash;a long lofty
room filled with streams of hurrying people&mdash;and among them a
face she knew.</p>

<p>The gazing-ball was gone&mdash;the room in the Disappointed
House was gone. She was no longer sitting in her chair looking on.
She was <i>in</i> that strange, great room&mdash;she was among
those throngs of people&mdash;she was standing by the man who was
waiting impatiently before a ticket-window. As he turned his face
and their eyes met she saw that it was Teddy&mdash;she saw the
amazed recognition in his eyes. And she knew, indisputably that he
was in some terrible danger&mdash;and that <i>she</i> must save
him.</p>

<p>"Teddy. <i>Come."</i></p>

<p>It seemed to her that she caught his hand and pulled him away
from the window. Then she was drifting back from
him&mdash;back&mdash;back&mdash;and he was following&mdash;running
after her&mdash;heedless of the people he ran
into&mdash;following&mdash;following&mdash;she was back on the
chair&mdash;outside of the gazing-ball&mdash;in it she still saw
the station-room shrunk again to play-size&mdash;and that one
figure running&mdash;still running&mdash;the cloud
again&mdash;filling the
ball&mdash;whitening&mdash;wavering&mdash;thinning&mdash;clearing.
Emily was lying back in her chair staring fixedly into Aunt Nancy's
gazing-ball, where the living-room was reflected calmly and
silverly, with a dead-white spot that was her face and one solitary
taper-light twinkling like an impish star.</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>Emily, feeling as if she had died and come back to life, got
herself out of the Disappointed House somehow, and locked the door.
The clouds had cleared away and the world was dim and unreal in
starlight. Hardly realizing what she was doing she turned her face
seaward through the spruce wood&mdash;down the long, windy,
pasture-field&mdash;over the dunes to the sandshore&mdash;along it
like a haunted, driven creature in a weird, uncanny half-lit
kingdom. The sea afar out was like grey satin half hidden in a
creeping fog but it washed against the sands as she passed in
little swishing, mocking ripples. She was shut in between the misty
sea and the high, dark sand-dunes. If she could only go on so
forever&mdash;never have to turn back and confront the unanswerable
question the night had put to her.</p>

<p>She <i>knew,</i> beyond any doubt or cavil or mockery that she
had seen Teddy&mdash;had saved, or tried to save him, from some
unknown peril. And she knew, just as simply and just as surely that
she loved him&mdash;had always loved him, with a love that lay at
the very foundation of her being.</p>

<p>And in two months' time she was to be married to Dean
Priest.</p>

<p>What could she do? To marry him now was unthinkable. She could
not live such a lie. But to break his heart&mdash;snatch from him
all the happiness possible to his thwarted life&mdash;that, too,
was unthinkable.</p>

<p>Yes, as Ilse had said, it <i>was</i> a very devilish thing to be
a woman.</p>

<p>"Particularly," said Emily, filled with bitter self-contempt, "a
woman who seemingly doesn't know her own mind for a month at a
time. I was so sure last summer that Teddy no longer meant anything
to me&mdash;so sure that I really cared enough for Dean to marry
him. And now to-night&mdash;and that horrible power or gift or
curse coming again when I thought I had outgrown it&mdash;left it
behind forever."</p>

<p>Emily walked on that eerie sandshore half the night and slipped
guiltily and stealthily into New Moon in the wee sma's to fling
herself on her bed and fall at last into the absolute slumber of
exhaustion.</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p>A very ghastly time followed. Fortunately Dean was away, having
gone to Montreal on business. It was during his absence that the
world was horrified by the tragedy of the <i>Flavian's</i> fatal
collision with an iceberg. The headlines struck Emily in the face
like a blow, Teddy was to have sailed on the
<i>Flavian</i>&mdash;Had he&mdash;had he? Who could tell her?
Perhaps his mother&mdash;his queer, solitary mother who hated her
with a hatred that Emily always felt like a tangible thing between
them. Hitherto Emily would have shrunk unspeakably from seeking
Mrs. Kent. Now nothing mattered except finding out if Teddy were on
the <i>Flavian.</i> She hurried to the Tansy Patch. Mrs Kent came
to the door&mdash;unaltered in all the years since Emily had first
known her&mdash;frail, furtive, with her bitter mouth and that
disfiguring red scar across her paleness. Her face changed as it
always did when she saw Emily. Hostility and fear contended in her
dark, melancholy eyes.</p>

<p>"Did Teddy sail on the <i>Flavian</i>?" demanded Emily without
circumlocution.</p>

<p>Mrs. Kent smiled&mdash;an unfriendly little smile.</p>

<p>"Does it matter to you?" she said.</p>

<p>"Yes." Emily was very blunt. The "Murray" look was on her
face&mdash;the look few people could encounter undefeatedly. "If
you know&mdash;tell me."</p>

<p>Mrs. Kent told her, unwillingly, hating her, shaking like a
little dead leaf quivering with a semblance of life in a cruel
wind.</p>

<p>"He did not. I had a cable from him to-day. At the last moment
he was prevented from sailing."</p>

<p>"Thank you." Emily turned away, but not before Mrs. Kent had
seen the joy and triumph that had leaped into her shadowy eyes. She
sprang forward and caught Emily's arm.</p>

<p>"It is nothing to you," she cried wildly. "Nothing to you
whether he is safe or not. You are going to marry another man. How
dare you come here&mdash;demanding to know of my son&mdash;as if
you had a right?"</p>

<p>Emily looked down at her pityingly, understandingly. This poor
creature whose jealousy, coiled in her soul like a snake, had made
life a vale of torment for her.</p>

<p>"No right perhaps&mdash;except the right of loving him," she
said.</p>

<p>Mrs. Kent struck her hands together wildly.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you dare to say that&mdash;you who are to marry
another man?"</p>

<p>"I am not going to marry another man," Emily found herself
saying. It was quite true. For days she had not known what to
do&mdash;now quite unmistakably she knew what she must do. Dreadful
as it would be, still something that must be done. Everything was
suddenly clear and bitter and inevitable before her.</p>

<p>"I cannot marry another man, Mrs. Kent, because I love Teddy.
But he does not love me. I know that quite well. So you need not
hate me any longer."</p>

<p>She turned and went swiftly away from the Tansy Patch. Where was
her pride, she wondered the pride of "the proud Murrays"&mdash;that
she could so calmly acknowledge an unsought, unwanted love. But
pride just then had no place in her.</p>

<hr><h2><a name="C11" id="C11"><i>Chapter XI</i></a>
</h2>

<p><i>&nbsp;</i>
</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>When the letter came from Teddy&mdash;the first letter for so
long&mdash;Emily's hand trembled so that she could hardly open
it.</p>

<p>"I must tell you of a strange thing that has happened," he
wrote. "Perhaps you know it already. And perhaps you know nothing
and will think me quite mad. I don't know what to think of it
myself. I know only what I saw&mdash;or thought I saw.</p>

<p>"I was waiting to buy my ticket for the boat-train to
Liverpool&mdash;I was to sail on the <i>Flavian.</i> Suddenly I
felt a touch on my arm&mdash;I turned and saw <i>you.</i> I swear
it. You said, 'Teddy&mdash;come.' I was so amazed I could not think
or speak. I could only follow you. You were running&mdash;no,
<i>not</i> running. I don't know how you went&mdash;I only knew
that you were retreating. How rotten this all sounds. <i>Was</i> I
crazy? And all at once you weren't there&mdash;though we were by
now away from the crowd in an open space where nothing could have
prevented me from seeing you. Yet I looked everywhere&mdash;and
came to my senses to realize that the boat-train had gone and I had
lost my passage on the <i>Flavian.</i> I was
furious&mdash;ashamed&mdash;until the news came. Then&mdash;I felt
my scalp crinkle.</p>

<p>"Emily&mdash;you're not in England? It can't be possible you are
in England. But then&mdash;what was it I saw in that station?</p>

<p>"Anyhow, I suppose it saved my life. If I had gone on the
<i>Flavian</i>&mdash;well, I didn't. Thanks to&mdash;what?</p>

<p>"I'll be home soon. Will sail on the <i>Moravian&mdash;</i>if
you don't prevent me again. Emily, I heard a queer story of you
long ago&mdash;something about Ilse's mother. I've almost
forgotten. Take care. They don't burn witches nowadays, of
course&mdash;but still&mdash;"</p>

<p>No, they didn't burn witches. But still&mdash;Emily felt that
she could have more easily faced the stake than what was before
her.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>Emily went up the hill path to keep tryst with Dean at the
Disappointed House. She had had a note from him that day, written
on his return from Montreal, asking her to meet him there at dusk.
He was waiting for her on the doorstep&mdash;eagerly, happily. The
robins were whistling softly in the fir copse and the evening was
fragrant with the tang of balsam. But the air all about them was
filled with the strangest, saddest, most unforgettable sound in
nature&mdash;the soft, ceaseless wash on a distant shore on a still
evening of the breakers of a spent storm. A sound rarely heard and
always to be remembered. It is even more mournful than the
rain-wind of night&mdash;the heart-break and despair of all
creation is in it. Dean took a quick step forward to meet
her&mdash;then stopped abruptly. Her face&mdash;her eyes&mdash;what
had happened to Emily in his absence? <i>This</i> was not
Emily&mdash;this strange, white, remote girl of the pale
twilight.</p>

<p>"Emily&mdash;what is it?" asked Dean&mdash;knowing before she
told him.</p>

<p>Emily looked at him. If you had to deal a mortal blow why try to
lighten it?</p>

<p>"I can't marry you after all, Dean," she said. "I don't love
you."</p>

<p>That was all she could say. No excuses&mdash;no self-defence.
There was none she could make. But it was shocking to see all the
happiness wiped out of a human face like that.</p>

<p>There was a little pause&mdash;a pause that seemed an eternity
with that unbearable sorrow of the sea throbbing through it. Then
Dean said still quietly:</p>

<p>"I knew you didn't love me. Yet you were&mdash;content to marry
me&mdash;before this. What has made it impossible?"</p>

<p>It was his right to know. Emily stumbled through her silly,
incredible tale.</p>

<p>"You see," she concluded miserably, "when&mdash;I can call like
that to him across space&mdash;I belong to him. He doesn't love
me&mdash;he never will&mdash;but I belong to him...Oh, Dean, don't
look so. I <i>had</i> to tell you this&mdash;but if you wish
it&mdash;I <i>will</i> marry you&mdash;only I felt you must know
the whole truth&mdash;when I knew it myself."</p>

<p>"Oh, a Murray of New Moon always keeps her word." Dean's face
twisted mockingly. "You will marry me&mdash;if I want you to. But I
don't want it&mdash;now. I see how impossible it is just as clearly
as you do. I will not marry a woman whose heart is another
man's."</p>

<p>"Can you ever forgive me, Dean?"</p>

<p>"What is there to forgive? I can't help loving you and you can't
help loving him. We must let it go at that. Even the gods can't
unscramble eggs. I should have known that only youth could call to
youth&mdash;and I was never young. If I ever had been, even though
I am old now, I might have held you."</p>

<p>He dropped his poor grey face in his hands. Emily found herself
thinking what a nice, pleasant, friendly thing death would be.</p>

<p>But when Dean looked up again his face had changed. It had the
old, mocking, cynical look.</p>

<p>"Don't look so tragic, Emily. A broken engagement is a very
slight thing nowadays. And it's an ill wind that blows nobody good.
Your aunts will thank whatever gods there be and my own clan will
think that I have escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowler.
Still&mdash;I rather wish that old Highland Scotch grandmother who
passed that dangerous chromosome down to you had taken her second
sight to the grave with her."</p>

<p>Emily put her hands against the little porch column and laid her
head against them. Dean's face changed again as he looked at her.
His voice when he spoke was very gentle&mdash;though cold and pale.
All the brilliance and colour and warmth had gone from it.</p>

<p>"Emily, I give your life back to you. It has been mine,
remember, since I saved you that day on Malvern rocks. It's your
own again. And we must say good-bye at last&mdash;in spite of our
old compact. Say it briefly&mdash;'all farewells should be sudden
when forever.'"</p>

<p>Emily turned and caught at his arm.</p>

<p>"Oh, not good-bye, Dean&mdash;not good-bye. Can't we be friends
still? I can't live without your friendship."</p>

<p>Dean took her face in his hands&mdash;Emily's cold face that he
had once dreamed might flush against his kiss&mdash;and looked
gravely and tenderly into it.</p>

<p>"We can't be friends again, dear."</p>

<p>"Oh, you will forget&mdash;you will not always care&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A man must die to forget you, I think. No, Star, we cannot be
friends. You will not have my love and it has driven everything
else out. I am going away. When I am old&mdash;really old&mdash;I
will come back and we will be friends again, perhaps."</p>

<p>"I can never forgive myself."</p>

<p>"Again I ask what for? I do not reproach you&mdash;I even thank
you for this year. It has been a royal gift to me. Nothing can ever
take it from me. After all, I would not give that last perfect
summer of mine for a generation of other men's happiness. My
Star&mdash;my Star!"</p>

<p>Emily looked at him, the kiss she had never given him in her
eyes. What a lonely place the world would be when Dean was
gone&mdash;the world that had all at once grown very old. And would
she ever be able to forget his eyes with that terrible expression
of pain in them?</p>

<p>If he had gone then she would never have been quite
free&mdash;always fettered by those piteous eyes and the thought of
the wrong she had done him. Perhaps Dean realized this, for there
was a hint of some malign triumph in his parting smile as he turned
away. He walked down the path&mdash;he paused with his hand on the
gate&mdash;he turned and came back.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>"Emily, I've something to confess, too. May as well get it off
my conscience. A lie&mdash;an ugly thing. I won you by a lie, I
think. Perhaps that is why I couldn't keep you."</p>

<p>"A lie?"</p>

<p>"You remember that book of yours? You asked me to tell you the
truth about what I thought of it? I didn't. I lied. It is a good
piece of work&mdash;very good. Oh, some faults in it of
course&mdash;a bit emotional&mdash;a bit overstrained. You still
need pruning&mdash;restraint. But it is good. It is out of the
ordinary both in conception and development. It has charm and your
characters <i>do</i> live. Natural, human, delightful. There, you
know what I think of it now."</p>

<p>Emily stared at him, a hot flush suddenly staining the pallor of
her tortured little face.</p>

<p>"Good? And I burned it," she said in a whisper.</p>

<p>Dean started.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;burned it!"</p>

<p>"Yes. And I can never write it again. Why&mdash;why did you lie
to me? <i>You?"</i></p>

<p>"Because I hated the book. You were more interested in it than
in me. You <i>would</i> have found a publisher eventually&mdash;and
it would have been successful. You would have been lost to me. How
ugly some motives look when you put them into words. And you burned
it? It seems very idle to say I'm bitterly sorry for all this. Idle
to ask your forgiveness."</p>

<p>Emily pulled herself together. Something had happened&mdash;she
was really free&mdash;free from remorse, shame, regret. Her own
woman once more. The balance hung level between them.</p>

<p>"I must not hold a grudge against Dean for this&mdash;like old
Hugh Murray," she thought confusedly. Aloud&mdash;"But I do&mdash;I
do forgive it, Dean."</p>

<p>"Thank you." He looked up at the little grey house behind her.
"So this is still to be the Disappointed House. Verily, there is a
doom on it. Houses, like people, can't escape their doom, it
seems."</p>

<p>Emily averted her gaze from the little house she had
loved&mdash;still loved. It would never be hers now. It was still
to be haunted by the ghosts of things that never happened.</p>

<p>"Dean&mdash;here is the key."</p>

<p>Dean shook his head. "Keep it till I ask for it. What use would
it be to me? The house can be sold, I suppose&mdash;though that
seems like sacrilege."</p>

<p>There was still something more. Emily held out her left hand
with averted face. Dean must take off the emerald he had put on.
She felt it drawn from her finger, leaving a little cold band where
it had warmed against her flesh, like a spectral circlet. It had
often seemed to her like a fetter, but she felt sick with regret
when she realized it was gone&mdash;forever. For with it went
something that had made life beautiful for years&mdash;Dean's
wonderful friendship and companionship. To miss that&mdash;forever.
She had not known how bitter a thing freedom could be.</p>

<p>When Dean had limped out of sight Emily went home. There was
nothing else to do. With her mocking triumph that Dean had at last
admitted she could write.</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>If Emily's engagement to Dean had made a commotion in the clans
the breaking of it brewed a still wilder teapot tempest. The
Priests were exultant and indignant at one and the same time, but
the inconsistent Murrays were furious. Aunt Elizabeth had steadily
disapproved of the engagement, but she disapproved still more
strongly of its breaking. What would people think? And many things
were said about "the Starr fickleness."</p>

<p>"Did you," demanded Uncle Wallace sarcastically, "expect that
girl to remain in the same mind from one day to another?"</p>

<p>All the Murrays said things, according to their separate
flavour, but for some reason Andrew's dictum rankled with the
keenest venom in Emily's bruised spirit. Andrew had picked up a
word somewhere&mdash;he said Emily was "temperamental." Half the
Murrays did not know just what it meant but they pounced on it
eagerly. Emily was "temperamental"&mdash;just that. It explained
everything&mdash;henceforth it clung to her like a burr. If she
wrote a poem&mdash;if she didn't like carrot pudding when everybody
else in the clan did&mdash;if she wore her hair low when every one
else was wearing it high&mdash;if she liked a solitary ramble over
moonlit hills&mdash;if she looked some mornings as if she had not
slept&mdash;if she took a notion to study the stars through a
field-glass&mdash;if it was whispered that she had been seen
dancing alone by moonlight among the coils of a New Moon
hayfield&mdash;if tears came into her eyes at the mere glimpse of
some beauty&mdash;if she loved a twilight tryst in the "old
orchard" better than a dance in Shrewsbury&mdash;it was all because
she was temperamental. Emily felt herself alone in a hostile world.
Nobody, not even Aunt Laura, understood. Even Ilse wrote rather an
odd letter, every sentence of which contradicted some other
sentence and left Emily with a nasty, confused feeling that Ilse
loved her as much as ever but thought her "temperamental" too.
Could Ilse, by any chance, have suspected the fact that, as soon as
Perry Miller heard that "everything was off" between Dean Priest
and Emily Starr, he had come out to New Moon and again asked Emily
to promise to marry him? Emily had made short work of him, after a
fashion which made Perry vow disgustedly that he was done with the
proud monkey. But then he had vowed that so many times before.</p>

</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>"MAY 4, 19&mdash;</p>

<p>"One o'clock is a somewhat unearthly hour to be writing in a
journal. The truth is, I've been undergoing a white night. I can't
sleep and I'm tired of lying in the dark fancying
things&mdash;unpleasant things&mdash;so I've lighted my candle and
hunted up my old diary to 'write it out.'</p>

<p>"I've never written in this journal since the night I burned my
book and fell downstairs&mdash;and died. Coming back to life to
find everything changed and all things made new. And unfamiliar and
dreadful. It seems a lifetime ago. As I turn over the pages and
glance at those gay, light-hearted entries I wonder if they were
really written by me, Emily Byrd Starr.</p>

<p>"Night is beautiful when you are happy&mdash;comforting when you
are in grief&mdash;terrible when you are lonely and unhappy. And
to-night I have been horribly lonely. Misery overwhelmed me. I seem
never to be able to stop half-way in any emotion and when
loneliness does seize hold on me it takes possession of me body and
soul and wrings me in its blank pain until all strength and courage
go out of me. To-night I am lonely&mdash;lonely. Love will not come
to me&mdash;friendship is lost to me&mdash;most of all, as I verily
feel, I cannot write. I have tried repeatedly and failed. The old
creative fire seems to have burned out into ashes and I cannot
rekindle it. All the evening I tried to write a story&mdash;a
wooden thing in which wooden puppets moved when I jerked the
strings. I finally tore it into a thousand pieces and felt that I
did God service.</p>

<p>"These past weeks have been bitter ones. Dean has
gone&mdash;where I know not. He has never written&mdash;never will,
I suppose. Not to be getting letters from Dean when he is away
seems strange and unnatural.</p>

<p>"And yet it is terribly sweet to be free once more.</p>

<p>"Ilse writes me that she is to be home for July and August. Also
that Teddy will be, too. Perhaps this latter fact partly accounts
for my white night. I want to run away before he comes.</p>

<p>"I have never answered the letter he wrote me after the sinking
of the <i>Flavian.</i> I could not. I could not write of
<i>that.</i> And if when he comes he speaks of it&mdash;I shall not
be able to bear it. Will he guess that it is because I love him
that I was able to set at naught the limitations of time and space
to save him? I am ready to die of shame at thought of it. And at
thought of what I said to Mrs. Kent. Yet somehow I have never been
able to wish <i>that</i> unsaid. There was a strange relief in the
stark honesty of it. I am not afraid she will ever tell him what I
said. She would never have him know I cared if she could prevent
it</p>

<p>"But I'd like to know how I am to get through the summer.</p>

<p>"There are times when I hate life. Other times again when I love
it fiercely with an agonized realization of how beautiful it
is&mdash;or might be&mdash;if&mdash;</p>

<p>"Before Dean went away he boarded up all the windows of the
Disappointed House. I never go where I can see it. But I <i>do</i>
see it for all that. Waiting there on its
hill&mdash;waiting&mdash;dumb&mdash;blind. I have never taken my
things out of it&mdash;which Aunt Elizabeth thinks a sure
indication of insanity. And I don't think Dean did either. Nothing
has been touched. Mona Lisa is still mocking in the gloom and
Elizabeth Bas is tolerantly contemptuous of temperamental idiots
and the Lady Giovanna understands it all. My dear little house! And
it is never to be a home. I feel as I felt that evening years ago
when I followed the rainbow&mdash;and lost it. 'There will be other
rainbows' I said then. But will there be?"</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>"MAY 15, 19&mdash;</p>

<p>"This has been a lyric spring day&mdash;and a miracle has
happened. It happened at dawn&mdash;when I was leaning out of my
window, listening to a little, whispering, tricksy wind o' morning
blowing out of Lofty John's bush. Suddenly&mdash;the flash
came&mdash;again&mdash;after these long months of absence&mdash;my
old, inexpressible glimpse of eternity. And all at once I knew I
could write. I rushed to my desk and seized my pen. All the hours
of early morning I wrote; and when I heard Cousin Jimmy going
downstairs I flung down my pen and bowed my head over my desk in
utter thankfulness that I could work again.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Get leave to work&mdash;<br>
In this world 'tis the best you get at all,<br>
For God in cursing gives us better gifts<br>
Than men in benediction.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>"So wrote Elizabeth Barrett Browning&mdash;and truly. It is hard
to understand why work should be called a curse&mdash;until one
remembers what bitterness forced or uncongenial labour is. But the
work for which we are fitted&mdash;which we feel we are sent into
the world to do&mdash;what a blessing it is and what fulness of joy
it holds. I felt this to-day as the old fever burned in my
finger-tips and my pen once more seemed a friend.</p>

<p>"'Leave to work'&mdash;one would think any one could obtain so
much. But sometimes anguish and heartbreak forbid us the leave. And
then we realize what we have lost and know that it is better to be
cursed by God than forgotten by Him. If He had punished Adam and
Eve by sending them out to <i>idleness,</i> then indeed they would
have been outcast and accursed. Not all the dreams of Eden 'whence
the four great rivers flow' could have been as sweet as those I am
dreaming to-night, because the power to work has come back to
me.</p>

<p>"Oh, God, as long as I live give me 'leave to work.' Thus pray
I. Leave and courage."</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>"MAY 25, 19&mdash;</p>

<p>"Dear sunshine, what a potent medicine you are. All day I
revelled in the loveliness of the wonderful white bridal world. And
to-night I washed my soul free from dust in the aerial bath of a
spring twilight. I chose the old hill road over the Delectable
Mountain for its solitude and wandered happily along, pausing every
few moments to think out fully some thought or fancy that came to
me like a winged spirit. Then I prowled about the hill fields till
long after dark, studying the stars with my field-glass. When I
came in I felt as if I had been millions of miles away in the blue
ether and all my old familiar surroundings seemed momentarily
forgotten and strange.</p>

<p>"But there was one star at which I did not look. Vega of the
Lyre."</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>"MAY 30, 19&mdash;</p>

<p>"This evening, just when I was in the middle of a story Aunt
Elizabeth said she wanted me to weed the onion-bed. So I had to lay
down my pen and go out to the kitchen garden. But one can weed
onions and think wonderful things at the same time, glory be. It is
one of the blessings that we don't always have to put our souls
into what our hands may be doing, praise the gods&mdash;for
otherwise who would have any soul left? So I weeded the onion-bed
and roamed the Milky Way in imagination."</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p>"JUNE 10, 19&mdash;</p>

<p>"Cousin Jimmy and I felt like murderers last night. We were.
Baby-killers at that!</p>

<p>"It is one of the springs when there is a crop of maple-trees.
Every key that fell from a maple this year seems to have grown. All
over the lawn and garden and old orchard tiny maple-trees have
sprung up by the hundreds. And of course they have to be rooted
out. It would never do to let them grow. So we pulled them up all
day yesterday and felt so mean and guilty over it. The dear, tiny,
baby things. They have a right to grow&mdash;a right to keep on
growing into great, majestic, splendid trees. Who are we to deny it
to them? I caught Cousin Jimmy in tears over the brutal
necessity.</p>

<p>"'I sometimes think,' he whispered, 'that it's wrong to prevent
anything from growing. <i>I</i> never grew up&mdash;not in my
head.'</p>

<p>"And last night I had a horrible dream of being pursued by
thousands of indignant young maple-tree ghosts. They crowded around
me&mdash;tripped me up&mdash;thrashed me with their
boughs&mdash;smothered me with their leaves. And I woke gasping for
breath and nearly frightened to death, but with a splendid idea for
a story in my head&mdash;<i>The Vengeance of the Tree."</i></p>

<h3>VI</h3>

<p>"JUNE 15, 19&mdash;</p>

<p>"I picked strawberries on the banks of Blair Water this
afternoon among the windy, sweet-smelling grasses. I love picking
strawberries. The occupation has in it something of perpetual
youth. The gods might have picked strawberries on high Olympus
without injuring their dignity. A queen&mdash;or a poet&mdash;might
stoop to it; a beggar has the privilege.</p>

<p>"And to-night I've been sitting here in my dear old room, with
my dear books and dear pictures and dear little window of the kinky
panes, dreaming in the soft, odorous summer twilight, while the
robins are calling to each other in Lofty John's bush and the
poplars are talking eerily of old, forgotten things.</p>

<p>"After all, it's not a bad old world&mdash;and the folks in it
are not half bad either. Even Emily Byrd Star is decent in spots.
Not altogether the false, fickle, ungrateful perversity she thinks
she is in the wee sma's&mdash;not altogether the friendless,
forgotten maiden she imagines she is on white nights&mdash;not
altogether the failure she supposes bitterly when three MSS. are
rejected in succession. And <i>not</i> altogether the coward she
feels herself to be when she thinks of Frederick Kent's coming to
Blair Water in July."</p>

<hr><h2><a name="C13" id="C13"><i>Chapter XIII</i></a>
</h2>

<p><i>&nbsp;</i>
</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>Emily was reading by the window of her room when she heard
it&mdash;reading Alice Meynell's strange poem, "Letter From A Girl
To Her Own Old Age," and thrilling mystically to its strange
prophecies. Outside dusk was falling over the old New Moon garden;
and clear through the dusk came the two high notes and the long low
one of Teddy's old whistle in Lofty John's bush&mdash;the old, old
call by which he had so often summoned her in the twilights of long
ago.</p>

<p>Emily's book fell unheeded to the floor. She stood up,
mist-pale, her eyes dilating into darkness. Was Teddy there? He had
not been expected till the next week, though Ilse was coming that
night. Could she have been mistaken? Could she have fancied it?
Some chance robin call&mdash;</p>

<p>It came again. She knew as she had known at first that it was
Teddy's whistle. There was no sound like it in the world. And it
had been so long since she had heard it. He was there&mdash;waiting
for her&mdash;calling for her. Should she go? She laughed under her
breath. Go? She had no choice. She must go. Pride could not hold
her back&mdash;bitter remembrance of the night she had waited for
his call and it had not come could not halt her hurrying footsteps.
Fear&mdash;shame&mdash;all were forgotten in the mad ecstasy of the
moment. Without giving herself time to reflect that she was a
Murray&mdash;only snatching a moment to look in the glass and
assure herself that her ivory crepe dress was very
becoming&mdash;how lucky it was that she had happened to put on
that dress!&mdash;she flew down the stairs and through the garden.
He was standing under the dark glamour of the old firs where the
path ran through Lofty John's bush&mdash;bareheaded, smiling.</p>

<p>"Teddy."</p>

<p>"Emily."</p>

<p>Her hands were in his&mdash;her eyes were shining into his.
Youth had come back&mdash;all that had once made magic made it
again. Together once more after all those long weary years of
alienation and separation. There was no longer any
shyness&mdash;any stiffness&mdash;any sense or fear of change. They
might have been children together again. But childhood had never
known this wild, insurgent sweetness&mdash;this unconsidered
surrender. Oh, she was his. By a word&mdash;a look&mdash;an
intonation, he was still her master. What matter if, in some calmer
mood, she might not quite like it&mdash;to be
helpless&mdash;dominated like this? What matter if to-morrow she
might wish she had not run so quickly, so eagerly, so
unhesitatingly to meet him? To-night nothing mattered except that
Teddy had come back.</p>

<p>Yet, outwardly, they did not meet as lovers&mdash;only as old,
dear friends. There was so much to talk of&mdash;so much to be
silent over as they paced up and down the garden walks, while the
stars laughed through the dark at
them&mdash;hinting&mdash;hinting&mdash;</p>

<p>Only one thing was not spoken of between them&mdash;the thing
Emily had dreaded. Teddy made no reference to the mystery of that
vision in the London station. It was as if it had never been. Yet
Emily felt that it had drawn them together again after long
misunderstanding. It was well not to speak of it&mdash;it was one
of those mystic things&mdash;one of the gods' secrets&mdash;that
must not be spoken of. Best forgotten now that its work was done.
And yet&mdash;so unreasonable are we mortals!&mdash;Emily felt a
ridiculous disappointment that he didn't speak of it. She didn't
want him to speak of it. But if it had meant anything to him must
he not have spoken of it?</p>

<p>"It's good to be here again," Teddy was saying. "Nothing seems
changed here. Time has stood still in this Garden of Eden. Look,
Emily, how bright Vega of the Lyre is. Our star. Have you forgotten
it?"</p>

<p>Forgotten? How she had wished she <i>could</i> forget.</p>

<p>"They wrote me you were going to marry Dean," said Teddy
abruptly.</p>

<p>"I meant to&mdash;but I couldn't," said Emily.</p>

<p>"Why not?" asked Teddy as if he had a perfect right to ask
it.</p>

<p>"Because I didn't love him," answered Emily, conceding his
right.</p>

<p>Laughter&mdash;golden, delicious laughter that made you suddenly
want to laugh too. Laughter was so <i>safe</i>&mdash;one could
laugh without betraying anything. Ilse had come&mdash;Ilse was
running down the walk. Ilse in a yellow silk gown the colour of her
hair and a golden-brown hat the colour of her eyes, giving you the
sensation that a gorgeous golden rose was at large in the
garden.</p>

<p>Emily almost welcomed her. The moment had grown too vital. Some
things were terrible if put into words. She drew away from Teddy
almost primly&mdash;a Murray of New Moon once more.</p>

<p>"Darlings," said Ilse, throwing an arm around each of them.
"Isn't it divine&mdash;all here together again? Oh, how much I love
you! Let's forget we are old and grown-up and wise and unhappy and
be mad, crazy, happy kids again for just one blissful summer."</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>A wonderful month followed. A month of indescribable roses,
exquisite hazes, silver perfection of moonlight, unforgettable
amethystine dusks, march of rains, bugle-call of winds, blossoms of
purple and star-dust, mystery, music, magic. A month of laughter
and dance and joy, of enchantment infinite. Yet a month of
restrained, hidden realization. Nothing was ever said. She and
Teddy were seldom ever alone together. But one felt&mdash;knew.
Emily fairly sparkled with happiness. All the old restlessness that
had worried Aunt Laura had gone from her eyes. Life was good.
Friendship&mdash;love&mdash;joy of sense and joy of
spirit&mdash;sorrow&mdash;loveliness&mdash;achievement&mdash;failure&mdash;longing&mdash;all
were part of life and therefore interesting and desirable.</p>

<p>Every morning when she awakened the new day seemed to her like
some good fairy who would bring her some beautiful gift of joy.
Ambition was, for the time at least, forgotten.
Success&mdash;power&mdash;fame. Let those who cared for them pay
the price and take them. But love is not bought and sold. It is a
gift.</p>

<p>Even the memory of her burned book ceased to ache. What did one
book more or less matter in this great universe of life and
passion? How pale and shadowy was any pictured life beside this
throbbing, scintillant existence! Who cared for laurel, after all?
Orange blossoms would make a sweeter coronet. And what star of
destiny was ever brighter and more alluring than Vega of the Lyre.
Which, being interpreted, simply meant that nothing mattered any
more in this world or any other except Teddy Kent.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>"If I had a tail I'd lash it," groaned Ilse, casting herself on
Emily's bed and hurling one of Emily's treasured volumes&mdash;a
little old copy of the <i>Rubaiyat</i> Teddy had given her in high
school days&mdash;across the room. The back came off and the leaves
flew every which way for a Sunday. Emily was annoyed.</p>

<p>"Were you ever in such a state that you could neither cry nor
pray nor swear?" demanded Ilse.</p>

<p>"Sometimes," agreed Emily dryly. "But I don't take it out on
books that never harmed me. I just go and bite off somebody's
head."</p>

<p>"There wasn't anybody's head handy to bite off, but I did
something that was just as effective," said Ilse, casting a
malevolent glance at Perry Miller's photograph which was propped up
on Emily's desk.</p>

<p>Emily glanced at it, too, and her face Murrayfied, as Ilse
expressed it. The photograph was still there but where Perry's
intent and unabashed eyes had gazed out at her were now only
jagged, unsightly holes.</p>

<p>Emily was furious. Perry had been so proud of those photographs.
They were the first he had had taken in his life. "Never could
afford any before," he had said frankly. He looked very handsome in
them, though his pose was a bit truculent and aggressive with his
wavy hair brushed back sleekly, and his firm mouth and chin showing
to excellent advantage. Aunt Elizabeth had gazed at it, secretly
wondering how she had ever dared make such a fine-looking young man
as that eat in the kitchen. And Aunt Laura had wiped her eyes
sentimentally and thought that perhaps&mdash;after all&mdash;Emily
and Perry&mdash;a lawyer would be quite a thing to have in the
family, coming in a good third to minister and doctor. Though, to
be sure, Stovepipe Town&mdash;</p>

<p>Perry had rather spoiled the gift for Emily by proposing to her
again. It was very hard for Perry Miller to get it into his head
that anything he wanted he couldn't get. And he had always wanted
Emily.</p>

<p>"I've got the world by the tail now," he said proudly. "Every
year'll find me higher up. Why can't you make up your mind to have
me, Emily?"</p>

<p>"Is it just a question of making up one's mind?" asked Emily
satirically.</p>

<p>"Of course. What else?"</p>

<p>"Listen, Perry," said Emily decidedly. "You're a good old pal. I
like you&mdash;I'll always like you. But I'm tired of this nonsense
and I'm going to put a stop to it. If you ever again ask me to
marry you I'll never never speak to you as long as I live. Since
you are good at making up your mind make up yours which you
want&mdash;my friendship or my non-existence."</p>

<p>"Oh, well." Perry shrugged his shoulders philosophically. He had
about come to the conclusion anyhow that he might as well give up
dangling after Emily Starr and getting nothing but snubs for his
pains. Ten years was long enough to be a rejected but faithful
swain. There were other girls, after all. Perhaps he had made a
mistake. <i>Too</i> faithful and persistent. If he had wooed by
fits and starts, blowing hot and cold like Teddy Kent, he might
have had better luck. Girls were like that. But Perry did not say
this. Stovepipe Town had learned a few things. All he said was:</p>

<p>"If you'd only stop looking at me in a certain way I might get
over hankering for you. Anyhow, I'd never have got this far along
if I hadn't been in love with you. I'd just have been a hired boy
somewhere or a fisherman at the harbour. So I'm sorry. I haven't
forgotten how you believed in me and helped me and stood up for me
to your Aunt Elizabeth. It's been&mdash;been"&mdash;Perry's
handsome face flushed suddenly and his voice shook a
little&mdash;"it's been&mdash;sweet&mdash;to dream about you all
these years. I guess I'll have to give it up now. No use, I see.
But don't take your friendship from me too, Emily."</p>

<p>"Never," said Emily impulsively putting out her hands. "You're a
brick, Perry dear. You've done wonders and I'm proud of you."</p>

<p>And now to find the picture he had given her ruined. She flashed
on Ilse eyes like a stormy sea.</p>

<p>"Ilse Burnley, how dare you do such a thing!"</p>

<p>"No use squizzling your eyebrows up at me like that, beloved
demon," retorted Ilse. "Hasn't no effect on me a-tall. Couldn't
endure that picture no-how. And Stovepipe Town in the
background."</p>

<p>"What you've done is on a level with Stovepipe Town."</p>

<p>"Well, he asked for it. Smirking there. 'Behold ME. I am a
Person In The Public Eye.' Never had such satisfaction as boring
your scissors through those conceited orbs gave me. Two seconds
more of looking at them and I'd have flung up my head and howled.
Oh, how I hate Perry Miller. Puffed up like a poisoned pup!"</p>

<p>"I thought you told me you loved him," said Emily rather
rudely.</p>

<p>"It's the same thing," said Ilse morosely. "Emily, why can't I
get that creature out of my mind! It's too Victorian to say heart.
I haven't any heart. I don't love him&mdash;I <i>do</i> hate him.
But I can't keep from thinking about him. <i>That's</i> just a
state of mind. Oh, I could yell at the moon. But the real reason I
dug his eyes out was his turning Grit after having been born and
raised Conservative."</p>

<p>"You are Conservative yourself."</p>

<p>"True but unimportant. I hate turncoats. I've never forgiven
Henry IV for turning Catholic. Not because he was a Protestant but
just because he was a turncoat I would have been just as implacable
if he had been Catholic and turned Protestant. Perry has changed
his politics just for the sake of getting into partnership with
Leonard Abel. There's Stovepipe Town for you. Oh, he'll be Judge
Miller and rich as wedding-cake&mdash;but&mdash;! I wish he had had
a hundred eyes so that I could have bored them all out! This is one
of the times I feel it would be handy to have been a bosom friend
of Lucrezia Borgia."</p>

<p>"Who was an excellent and rather stupid woman beloved for her
good works."</p>

<p>"Oh, I know the modern whitewashers are determined to rob
history of anything that is picturesque. No matter, I shall cling
to my faith in Lucrezia and William Tell. Put that picture out of
my sight. <i>Please,</i> Emily."</p>

<p>Emily put the maltreated picture away in a drawer of her desk.
Her brief anger had gone. She understood. At least she understood
why the eyes had been cut out. It was harder to understand just why
Ilse could care so much and so incurably for Perry Miller. And
there was just a hint of pity in her heart as
well&mdash;condescending pity for Ilse who cared so much for a man
who didn't care for her.</p>

<p>"I think this will cure me," said Ilse savagely. "I
can't&mdash;I won't love a turncoat. Blind bat&mdash;congenital
idiot that he is! Pah, I'm through with him. Emily, I wonder I
don't hate you. Rejecting with scorn what I want so much. Ice-cold
thing, did you ever really care for anything or any creature except
that pen of yours?"</p>

<p>"Perry has never really loved me," evaded Emily. "He only
imagines he does."</p>

<p>"Well, I'd be content if he would only just imagine he loved me.
How brazen I am about it. You're the one person in the world I can
have the relief of saying such things to. That's why I can't let
myself hate you, after all. I daresay I'm not half as unhappy as I
think myself. One never knows what may be around the next corner.
After this I mean to bore Perry Miller out of my life and thoughts
just as I bored his eyes out. Emily," with an abrupt change of tone
and posture, "do you know I like Teddy Kent better this summer than
I ever did before."</p>

<p>"Oh." The monosyllable was eloquent, but Ilse was deaf to all
its implications.</p>

<p>"Yes. He's really charming. Those years in Europe have done
something to him. Perhaps it's just that they've taught him to hide
his selfishness better."</p>

<p>"Teddy Kent isn't selfish. Why do you call him selfish? Look at
his devotion to his mother."</p>

<p>"Because she adores him. Teddy likes to be adored. That's why
he's never fallen in love with any one, you know. That&mdash;and
because the girls chased him so, perhaps. It was sickening in
Montreal. They made such asses of themselves&mdash;waiting on him
with their tongues hanging out&mdash;that I wanted to dress in male
attire and swear I wasn't of their sex. No doubt it was the same in
Europe. No man alive can stand six years of that without being
spoiled&mdash;and contemptuous. Teddy is all right with
<i>us</i>&mdash;he knows we're old pals who can see through him and
will stand no nonsense. But I've see him accepting
tribute&mdash;graciously bestowing a smile&mdash;a look&mdash;a
touch as a reward. Saying to every one just what he thought she'd
like to hear. When I saw it I always felt I'd love to say something
to him that he'd think of for years whenever he woke up at three
o'clock o'night."</p>

<p>The sun had dropped into a bank of purple cloud behind the
Delectable Mountain and a chill and shadow swept down the hill and
across the dewy clover-fields to New Moon. The little room darkened
and the glimpse of Blair Water through the gap in Lofty John's bush
changed all at once to livid grey.</p>

<p>Emily's evening was spoiled. But she
felt&mdash;<i>knew</i>&mdash;that Ilse was mistaken about many
things. There was one comfort, too&mdash;evidently she had kept her
secret well. Not even Ilse suspected it. Which was agreeable to
both the Murray and the Starr.</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>But Emily sat long at her window looking into the black night
that turned slowly to pale silver as the moon rose. So the girls
had "chased" Teddy.</p>

<p>She wished she had not run quite so quickly when he had called
from Lofty John's bush. "Oh, whistle, and I'll come to you, my lad"
was all very well in song. But one was not living in a Scotch
ballad. And that change in Ilse's voice&mdash;that almost
confidential note. Did Ilse mean&mdash;? How pretty Ilse had looked
to-night. In that smart, sleeveless dress of green sprinkled with
tiny golden butterflies&mdash;with the green necklace that circled
her throat and fell to her hips like a long green snake&mdash;with
her green, gold-buckled shoes&mdash;Ilse always wore such ravishing
shoes. <i>Did</i> Ilse mean&mdash;? And if she did&mdash;?</p>

<p>After breakfast Aunt Laura remarked to Cousin Jimmy that she
felt sure something was on the dear child's mind.</p>

<hr><h2><a name="C14" id="C14"><i>Chapter XIV</i></a>
</h2>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>"The early bird catches&mdash;the desire of his heart," said
Teddy, slipping down beside Emily on the long, silken, pale-green
grasses on the bank of Blair Water.</p>

<p>He had come so silently that Emily had not heard him until she
saw him and she could not repress a start and blush&mdash;which she
hoped wildly he did not see. She had wakened early and been seized
with what her clan would doubtless have considered a temperamental
desire to see the sun rise and make new acquaintances with Eden. So
she had stolen down New Moon stairs and through the expectant
garden and Lofty John's bush to the Blair Water to meet the mystery
of the dawn. It had never occurred to her that Teddy would be
prowling, too.</p>

<p>"I like to come down here at sunrise, now and then," he said.
"It's about the only chance I have of being alone for a few
minutes. Our evenings and afternoons are all given over the mad
revelry&mdash;and Mother likes me to be with her every moment of
the forenoons. She's had six such horribly lonely years."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry I've intruded on your precious solitude," said Emily
stiffly, possessed of a horrible fear that he might think she knew
of his habits and had come purposely to meet him.</p>

<p>Teddy laughed.</p>

<p>"Don't put on New Moon airs with me, Emily Byrd Starr. You know
perfectly well that finding you here is the crown of the morning
for me. I've always had a wild hope that it might happen. And now
it has. Let's just sit here and dream together. God made this
morning for us&mdash;just us two. Even talking would spoil it."</p>

<p>Emily agreed silently. How dear it was to sit here with Teddy on
the banks of Blair Water, under the coral of the morning sky, and
dream&mdash;just dream&mdash;wild, sweet, secret, unforgettable,
foolish dreams. Alone with Teddy while all their world was
sleeping. Oh, if this exquisite stolen moment could last! A line
from some poem of Marjorie Pickthall quivered in her thought like a
bar of music&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Oh, keep the world forever at the dawn.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>She said it like a prayer under her breath.</p>

<p>Everything was so beautiful in this magical moment before
sunrise. The wild blue irises around the pond, the violet shadows
in the curves of the dunes, the white filmy mist hanging over the
buttercup valley across the pond, the cloth of gold and silver that
was called a field of daisies, the cool, delicious gulf breeze, the
blue of far lands beyond the harbour, plumes of purple and mauve
smoke going up on the still, golden air from the chimneys of
Stovepipe Town where the fishermen rose early. And Teddy lying at
her feet, his slim brown hands clasped behind his head. Again she
felt inescapably the magnetic attraction of his personality. Felt
it so strongly that she dared not meet his eyes. Yet she was
admitting to herself with a secret candour which would have
horrified Aunt Elizabeth that she wanted to run her fingers through
his sleek black hair&mdash;feel his arms about her&mdash;press her
face against his dark tender one&mdash;feel his lips on her
lips&mdash;</p>

<p>Teddy took one of his hands from under his head and put it over
hers.</p>

<p>For a moment of surrender she left it there. Then Ilse's words
flashed into memory, searing her consciousness like a dagger of
flame. "I've seen him accepting tribute"&mdash;"graciously
bestowing a touch as a reward"&mdash;"saying to each one just what
he thought she wanted to hear." Had Teddy guessed what she had been
thinking? Her thoughts had seemed so vivid to her that she felt as
if any one must <i>see</i> her thinking. Intolerable. She sprang up
abruptly, shaking off his fingers.</p>

<p>"I must be going home."</p>

<p>So blunt. Somehow, she could not make it smoother. He must
not&mdash;should not think&mdash;Teddy rose, too. A change in his
voice and look. Their marvellous moment was over.</p>

<p>"So must I. Mother will be missing me. She's always up early.
Poor little Mother. She hasn't changed. She isn't proud of my
success&mdash;she hates it. She thinks it has taken me from her.
The years have not made it any easier for her. I want her to come
away with me, but she will not. I think that is partly because she
cannot bear to leave the old Tansy Patch and partly because she
can't endure seeing me shut up in my studio working&mdash;something
that would bar her out. I wonder what made her so. I've never known
her any other way, but I think she must have been different once.
It's odd for a son to know as little of his mother's life as I do.
I don't even know what made that scar on her face. I know next to
nothing of my father&mdash;absolutely nothing of his people. She
will never talk of anything in the years before we came to Blair
Water."</p>

<p>"Something hurt her once&mdash;hurt her so terribly she has
never got over it," said Emily.</p>

<p>"My father's death, perhaps?"</p>

<p>"No. At least, not if it were just death. There was something
else&mdash;something poisonous. Well&mdash;bye-bye."</p>

<p>"Going to Mrs. Chidlaw's dinner-dance tomorrow night?"</p>

<p>"Yes. She is sending her car for me."</p>

<p>"Whew! No use after that asking you to go with me in a one-hoss
buggy&mdash;borrowed at that. Well, I must take Ilse then. Perry to
be there?"</p>

<p>"No. He wrote me he couldn't come&mdash;had to prepare for his
first case. It's coming up next day."</p>

<p>"Perry is forging ahead, isn't he? That bulldog tenacity of his
never lets go of an objective once he gets his teeth into it. He'll
be rich when we're still as poor as church mice. But then, we're
chasing rainbow gold, aren't we?"</p>

<p>She would not linger&mdash;he might think she wanted to
linger&mdash;"waiting with her tongue hanging out"&mdash;she turned
away almost ungraciously. He had been so unregretfully ready to
"take Ilse then." As if it really didn't matter much. Yet she was
still conscious of his touch on her hand&mdash;it burned there yet.
In that fleeting moment, in that brief caress, he had made her
wholly his, as years of wifehood could never have made her Dean's.
She could think of nothing else all day. She lived over and over
again that moment of surrender. It seemed to her so inadequate that
everything should be the same at New Moon and that Cousin Jimmy
should be worrying over red spiders on his asters.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>A tack on the Shrewsbury road made Emily fifteen minutes late
for Mrs. Chidlaw's dinner. She flung a hasty glance into the mirror
before she went down and turned away satisfied. An arrow of
rhinestones in her dark hair&mdash;she had hair that wore jewels
well&mdash;lent the necessary note of brilliance to the new dress
of silvery-green lace over a pale-blue slip that became her so
well. Miss Royal had picked it for her in New York&mdash;and Aunts
Elizabeth and Laura had looked askance at it. Green and blue was
<i>such</i> an odd combination. And there was so little of it. But
it did something to Emily when she put it on. Cousin Jimmy looked
at the exquisite, shimmering young thing with stars in her eyes, in
the old candle-lighted kitchen and said ruefully to Aunt Laura
after she had gone, "She doesn't belong to <i>us</i> in that
dress."</p>

<p>"It made her look like an <i>actress</i>," said Aunt Elizabeth
freezingly.</p>

<p>Emily did not feel like an actress as she ran down Mrs.
Chidlaw's stairs and across the sun-room to the wide verandah where
Mrs. Chidlaw had elected to hold her dinner party. She felt real,
vital, happy, expectant. Teddy would be there&mdash;their eyes
would meet significantly across the table&mdash;there would be the
furtive sweetness of watching him secretly when he talked to some
one else&mdash;and thought of <i>her</i>&mdash;they would dance
together afterwards. Perhaps he would tell her&mdash;what she was
longing to hear&mdash;</p>

<p>She paused for a second in the open doorway, her eyes soft and
dreamy as a purple mist, looking out on the scene before
her&mdash;one of those scenes which are always remembered from some
subtle charm of their own.</p>

<p>The table was spread in the big rounded alcove at the corner of
the vine-hung verandah. Beyond it tall, dark firs and Lombardies
stood out against the after-sunset sky of dull rose and fading
yellow. Through their stems she caught glimpses of the bay, dark
and sapphire. Great masses of shadow beyond the little island of
light&mdash;the gleam of pearls on Ilse's white neck. There were
other guests&mdash;Professor Robins of McGill with his long,
melancholy face made still longer by his odd spade-shaped beard;
Lisette Chidlaw's round, cream-coloured, kissable face with its
dark hair heaped high over it and her round, dark eyes; Jack
Glenlake, dreamy and handsome; Annette Shaw, a sleepy,
gold-and-white thing, always affecting a Mona Lisa smile; stocky
little Tom Hallam with his humorous Irish face; Aylmer Vincent.
Quite fat. Beginning to be bald. Still making pretty speeches to
the ladies. How absurd to recall that she had once thought him
Prince Charming! Solemn-looking Gus Rankin, with a vacant chair
beside him, evidently for her. Elsie Borland, young and chubby,
showing off her lovely hands a little in the candlelight. But of
all the party Emily only saw Teddy and Ilse. The rest were
puppets.</p>

<p>They were sitting together just opposite her. Teddy sleek and
well-groomed as usual, his black head close to Ilse's golden one.
Ilse, a glorified shining creature in torquoise-blue taffeta,
looking the queen with a foam of laces on her full bosom and
rose-and-silver nosegays at her shoulder. Just as Emily looked at
them Ilse lifted her eyes to Teddy's face and asked some
question&mdash;some intimate, vital question, Emily felt sure, from
the expression of her face. She did not recall ever having seen
just that look on Ilse's face before. There was some sort of
definite challenge in it. Teddy looked down and answered her. Emily
knew or felt that the word "love" was in his answer. Those two
looked long into each other's eyes&mdash;at least it seemed long to
Emily, beholding that interchange of rapt glances. Then Ilse
blushed and looked away. When had Ilse ever blushed before? And
Teddy threw up his head and swept the table with eyes that seemed
exultant and victorious.</p>

<p>Emily went out into the circle of radiance from that terrible
moment of disillusion. Her heart, so gay and light a moment before,
seemed cold and dead. In spite of the lights and laughter a dark,
chill night seemed to be coming towards her. Everything in life
seemed suddenly ugly. It was for her a dinner of bitter herbs and
she never remembered anything Gus Rankin said to her. She never
looked at Teddy, who seemed in wonderful spirits and was keeping up
a stream of banter with Ilse, and she was chilly and unresponsive
through the whole meal. Gus Rankin told all his favourite stories
but like Queen Victoria of blessed memory, Emily was not amused.
Mrs. Chidlaw was provoked and repented of having sent her car for
so temperamental a guest. Annoyed probably over being paired with
Gus Rankin, who had been asked at the last minute to fill Perry
Miller's place. And looking like an outraged duchess over it. Yet
you had to be civil to her. She might put you in a book if you
weren't. Remember that time she wrote the review of our play! In
reality, poor Emily was thanking whatever gods there be that she
was beside Gus Rankin, who never wanted or expected any one to
talk.</p>

<p>The dance was a ghastly affair for Emily. She felt like a ghost
moving among revellers she had suddenly outgrown. She danced once
with Teddy and Teddy, realizing that it was only her slim,
silvery-green form he held, while her soul had retreated into some
aloof impregnable citadel, did not ask her again. He danced several
dances with Ilse and then sat out several more with her in the
garden. His devotion to her was noticed and commented upon.
Millicent Chidlaw asked Emily if the report that Ilse Burnley and
Frederick Kent were engaged were true.</p>

<p>"He was always crazy about her, wasn't he?" Millicent wanted to
know.</p>

<p>Emily, in a cool and impertinent voice, supposed so. Was
Millicent watching her to see if she would flinch?</p>

<p>Of course he was in love with Ilse. What wonder? Ilse was so
beautiful. What chance could her own moonlit charm of dark and
silver have against that gold and ivory loveliness? Teddy liked
<i>her</i> as a dear old pal and chum. That was all. She had been a
fool <i>again.</i> Always deceiving herself. That morning by Blair
Water&mdash;when she had almost let him see&mdash;perhaps he
<i>had</i> seen&mdash;the thought was unbearable. Would she ever
learn wisdom? Oh, yes, she had learned it to-night. No more folly.
How wise and dignified and unapproachable she would be
henceforth.</p>

<p>Wasn't there some wretched, vulgar old proverb anent locking a
stable door after the horse was stolen?</p>

<p>And just how was she to get through the rest of the night?</p>

<hr><h2><a name="C15" id="C15"><i>Chapter XV</i></a>
</h2>

<p><i>&nbsp;</i>
</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>Emily, just home from an interminable week's visit at Uncle
Oliver's, where a cousin had been getting married, heard at the
post-office that Teddy Kent had gone.</p>

<p>"Left at an hour's notice," Mrs. Crosby told her. '"Got a wire
asking if he would take the vice-principal-ship of the College of
Art in Montreal and had to go at once to see about it. Isn't that
splendid? Hasn't he got on? It's really quite wonderful. Blair
Water should be very proud of him, shouldn't it? Isn't it a pity
his mother is so odd?"</p>

<p>Fortunately Mrs. Crosby never took time to await any answer to
her questions. Emily knew she was turning pale and hated herself
for it. She clutched her mail and hastened out of the post-office.
She passed several people on the way home and never realized it. As
a consequence her reputation for pride went up dangerously. But
when she reached New Moon Aunt Laura handed her a letter.</p>

<p>"Teddy left it. He was here last night to say good-bye."</p>

<p>The proud Miss Starr had a narrow escape from bursting into
hysterical tears on the spot. A Murray in hysterics! Never had such
a thing been heard of&mdash;never must be heard of. Emily gritted
her teeth, took the letter silently and went to her room. The ice
around her heart was melting rapidly. Oh, why had she been so cool
and dignified with Teddy all that week after Mrs. Chidlaw's dance?
But she had never dreamed he would be going away so soon. And
now&mdash;</p>

<p>She opened her letter. There was nothing in it but a clipping of
some ridiculous poetry Perry had written and published in a
Charlottetown paper&mdash;a paper that was not taken at New Moon.
She and Teddy had laughed over it&mdash;Ilse had been too angry to
laugh&mdash;and Teddy had promised to get a copy for her.</p>

<p>Well, he had got it.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>She was sitting there, looking whitely out into the soft, black,
velvety night with its goblin-market of wind-tossed trees, when
Ilse, who had also been away in Charlottetown, came in.</p>

<p>"So Teddy has gone. I see you have a letter from him, too."</p>

<p>Too!</p>

<p>"Yes," said Emily, wondering if it were a lie. Then concluded
desperately she did not care whether it was a lie or not.</p>

<p>"He was terribly sorry to have to go so suddenly, but he had to
decide at once and he couldn't decide without getting some more
information about it. Teddy won't tie himself down too irrevocably
to any position, no matter how tempting it is. And to be
vice-principal of that college at his age is some little bouquet.
Well, I'll soon have to go myself. It's been a gorgeous vacation
but&mdash;Going to the dance at Derry Pond to-morrow night,
Emily?"</p>

<p>Emily shook her head. Of what use was dancing now that Teddy was
gone?</p>

<p>"Do you know," said Ilse pensively, "I think this summer has
been rather a failure, in spite of our fun. We thought we could be
children again, but we haven't been. We've only been
pretending."</p>

<p>Pretending? Oh, if this heartache were only a pretence! And this
burning shame and deep, mute hurt. Teddy had not even cared enough
to write her a line of farewell. She knew&mdash;she had known ever
since the Chidlaw dance&mdash;he did not love her; but surely
friendship demanded something. Even her friendship meant nothing to
him. This summer had been only an interlude to him. Now he had gone
back to his real life and the things that mattered. And he had
written Ilse. Pretend? Oh, well, she would pretend with a
vengeance. There were times when the Murray pride was certainly an
asset.</p>

<p>"I think it's as well the summer is over," she said carelessly.
"I simply <i>must</i> get down to work again. I have neglected my
writing shamefully the past two months."</p>

<p>"After all, that's all you really care about, isn't it?" said
Ilse curiously. "I love my work but it doesn't possess me as yours
possesses you. I'd give it up in a twinkling for&mdash;well, we're
all as we're made. But is it really comfortable, Emily, to care for
only one thing in life?"</p>

<p>"Much more comfortable than caring for too many things."</p>

<p>"I suppose so. Well, you ought to succeed when you lay
everything on the altar of your goddess. That's the difference
between us. I'm of weaker clay. There are some things I couldn't
give up&mdash;some things I <i>won't.</i> And as Old Kelly advises,
if I can't get what I want&mdash;well, I'll want what I can get.
Isn't that common sense?"</p>

<p>Emily, wishing she could fool herself as easily as she could
other people, went over to the window and kissed Ilse's
forehead.</p>

<p>"We aren't children any longer&mdash;and we can't go back to
childhood, Ilse. We're women&mdash;and must make the best of it. I
think you'll be happy yet. I <i>want</i> you to be."</p>

<p>Ilse squeezed Emily's hand. "Darn common-sense!" she said
drearily.</p>

<p>If she had not been in New Moon she would probably have used the
unexpurgated edition.</p>

<hr><h2><a name="C16" id="C16"><i>Chapter XVI</i></a>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>"NOV. 17, 19&mdash;</p>

<p>"There are two adjectives that are never separated in regard to
a November day&mdash;'dull' and 'gloomy.' They were wedded together
in the dawn of language and it is not for me to divorce them now.
Accordingly, then, this day has been dull and gloomy, inside and
outside, materially and spiritually.</p>

<p>"Yesterday wasn't so bad. There was a warm autumnal sun and
Cousin Jimmy's big heap of pumpkins made a lovely pool of colour
against the old grey barns, and the valley down by the brook was
mellow with the late, leafless gold of juniper-trees. I walked in
the afternoon through the uncanny enchantment of November woods,
still haunted by loveliness, and again in the evening in the
afterglow of an autumnal sunset. The evening was mild and wrapped
in a great, grey, brooding stillness of windless fields and waiting
hill&mdash;a stillness which was yet threaded through with many
little eerie, beautiful sounds which I could hear if I listened as
much with my soul as my ears. Later on there was a procession of
stars and I got a message from them.</p>

<p>"But to-day <i>was</i> dreary. And to-night virtue has gone out
of me. I wrote all day but I could not write this evening. I shut
myself into my room and paced it like a caged creature. ''Tis the
middle of the night by the castle clock,' but there is no use in
thinking of sleep. I can't sleep. The rain against the window is
very dismal and the winds are marching by like armies of the dead.
All the little ghostly joys of the past are haunting me&mdash;all
the ghostly fears of the future.</p>

<p>"I keep thinking&mdash;foolishly&mdash;of the Disappointed House
to-night&mdash;up there on the hill with the roar of the rainy wind
about it. Somehow this is what hurts me worst to-night. Other
nights it is the fact that I don't even know where Dean is this
winter&mdash;or that Teddy never writes a line to me&mdash;or just
that there are hours when sheer loneliness wrings the stamina out
of me. In such moments I come to this old journal for comforting.
It's like talking it out to a faithful friend."</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>"NOV. 30, 19&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have two chrysanthemums and a rose out. The rose is a song
and a dream and an enchantment all in one. The 'mums are very
pretty, too, but it does not do to have them and the rose too near
together. Seen by themselves they are handsome, bright blossoms,
pink and yellow, and cheery, looking very well satisfied with
themselves. But set the rose behind them and the change is actually
amusing. They then seem like vulgar, frowsy kitchen maids beside a
stately, white queen. It's not the fault of the poor 'mums that
they weren't born roses, so to be fair to them I keep them by
themselves and enjoy them that way.</p>

<p>"I wrote a <i>good</i> story to-day. I think even Mr. Carpenter
would have been satisfied with it. I was happy while I was writing
it. But when I finished it and came back to reality&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, I'm not going to growl. Life has at least grown
<i>livable</i> again. It was <i>not</i> livable through the autumn.
I know Aunt Laura thought I was going into consumption. Not I. That
would be too Victorian. I fought things out and conquered them and
I'm a sane, <i>free</i> woman once more. Though the taste of my
folly is still in my mouth at times and very bitter it is.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm really getting on very well. I'm beginning to make a
livable income for myself and Aunt Elizabeth reads my stories aloud
o' evenings to Aunt Laura and Cousin Jimmy. I can always get
through <i>to-day</i> very nicely. It's to-morrow I can't live
through."</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>"JANUARY 15, 19&mdash;</p>

<p>"I've been out for a moonlit snowshoe tramp. There was a nice
bite of frost in the air and the night was exquisite&mdash;a
frosty, starry lyric of light. Some nights are like honey&mdash;and
some like wine&mdash;and some like wormwood. To-night is like
wine&mdash;white wine&mdash;some clear, sparkling, fairy brew that
rather goes to one's head. I am tingling all over with hope and
expectation and victory over certain principalities and powers that
got a grip on me last night about three o'clock.</p>

<p>"I have just drawn aside the curtain of my window and looked
out. The garden is white and still under the moon, all ebony of
shadow and silver of frosted snow. Over it all the delicate
traceries where trees stand up leafless in seeming death and
sorrow. But only seeming. The life-blood is at their hearts and by
and by it will stir and they will clothe themselves in bridal
garments of young green leaves and pink blossoms. And over there
where the biggest drift of all lies deep the Golden Ones will
uplift their trumpets of the morning.</p>

<p>"And far beyond our garden field after field lies white and
lonely in the moonlight. Lonely? I hadn't meant to write that word.
It slipped in. I'm <i>not</i> lonely&mdash;I have my work and my
books and the hope of spring&mdash;and I know that this calm,
simple existence is a much better and happier one than the hectic
life I led last summer.</p>

<p>"I believed that before I wrote it down. And now I don't believe
it. It isn't true. This is stagnation!!</p>

<p>"Oh, I am&mdash;I <i>am</i> lonely&mdash;with the loneliness of
unshared thought. What is the use of denying it? When I came in I
<i>was</i> the victor&mdash;but now my banner is in the dust
again."</p>

<p>"FEB. 20, 19&mdash;</p>

<p>"Something has happened to sour February's temper. Such a
peevish month. The weather for the past few weeks has certainly
been living up to the Murray traditions.</p>

<p>"A dreary snowstorm is raging and the wind is pursuing tormented
wraiths over the hills. I know that out beyond the trees Blair
Water is a sad, black thing in a desert of whiteness. But the
great, dark, wintry night outside makes my cosy little room with
its crackling fire seem cosier, and I feel much more contented with
the world than I did that beautiful night in January. To-night
isn't so&mdash;so <i>insulting.</i></p>

<p>"To-day in <i>Glassford's Magazine</i> there was a story
illustration by Teddy. I saw my own face looking out at me in the
heroine. It always gives me a very ghostly sensation. And to-day it
angered me as well. My face has <i>no right</i> to mean anything to
him when <i>I</i> don't.</p>

<p>"But for all that, I cut out his picture, which was in the
'Who's Who' column, and put it in a frame and set it on my desk. I
have no picture of Teddy. And to-night I took it out of the frame
and laid it on the coals in the fireplace and watched it shrivel
up. Just before the fire went out of it a queer little shudder went
over it and Teddy seemed to wink at me&mdash;an impish, derisive
wink&mdash;as if he said:</p>

<p>"'You <i>think</i> you've forgotten&mdash;but if you had you
wouldn't have burned me. You are mine&mdash;you will always be
mine&mdash;and I don't want you.'</p>

<p>"If a good fairy were suddenly to appear before me and offer me
a wish it would be this: to have Teddy Kent come and whistle again
and again in Lofty John's bush. And I would not go&mdash;not one
step.</p>

<p>"I <i>can't</i> endure this. <i>I</i> must put him out of my
life."</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>The Murray clan had a really terrible time in the summer that
followed Emily's twenty-second birthday. Neither Teddy nor Ilse
came home that summer. Ilse was touring in the West and Teddy
betook himself into some northern hinterland with an Indian treaty
party to make illustrations for a serial. But Emily had so many
beaus that Blair Water gossip was in as bad a plight as the
centipede who couldn't tell which foot came after which. So many
beaus and not one of them such as the connection could approve
of.</p>

<p>There was handsome, dashing Jack Bannister, the Derry Pond Don
Juan&mdash;"a picturesque scoundrel," as Dr. Burnley called him.
Certainly Jack was untrammelled by any moral code. But who knew
what effect his silver tongue and good looks might have on
temperamental Emily? It worried the Murrays for three weeks and
then it appeared that Emily had some sense, after all. Jack
Bannister faded out of the picture.</p>

<p>"Emily should never have even <i>spoken</i> to him," said Uncle
Oliver indignantly. "Why, they say he keeps a diary and writes down
all his love affairs in it and what the girls said to him."</p>

<p>"Don't worry. He won't write down what <i>I</i> said to him,"
said Emily, when Aunt Laura reported this to her anxiously.</p>

<p>Harold Conway was another anxiety. A Shrewsbury man in his
thirties, who looked like a poet gone to seed. With a shock of wavy
dark auburn hair and brilliant brown eyes. Who "fiddled for a
living."</p>

<p>Emily went to a concert and a play with him and the New Moon
aunts had some sleepless nights. But when in Blair Water parlance
Rod Dunbar "cut him out" things were even worse. The Dunbars were
"nothing" when it came to religion. Rod's mother, to be sure, was a
Presbyterian, but his father was a Methodist, his brother a Baptist
and one sister a Christian Scientist. The other sister was a
Theosophist, which was worse than all the rest because they had no
idea <i>what</i> it was. In all this mixture what on earth was Rod?
Certainly no match for an orthodox niece of New Moon.</p>

<p>"His great-uncle was a religious maniac," said Uncle Wallace
gloomily. "He was kept chained in his bedroom for sixteen years.
<i>What</i> has got into that girl? Is she idiot or demon?"</p>

<p>Yet the Dunbars were at least a respectable family; but what was
to be said of Larry Dix&mdash;one of the "notorious Priest Pond
Dixes"&mdash;whose father had once pastured his cows in the
graveyard and whose uncle was more than suspected of having thrown
a dead cat down a neighbour's well for spite? To be sure, Larry
himself was doing well as a dentist and was such a deadly-serious,
solemn-in-earnest young man that nothing much could be urged
against him, if one could only swallow the fact that he was a Dix.
Nevertheless, Aunt Elizabeth was much relieved when Emily turned
him adrift.</p>

<p>"Such presumption," said Aunt Laura, meaning for a Dix to aspire
to a Murray.</p>

<p>"It wasn't because of his presumption I packed him off," said
Emily. "It was because of the way he made love. He made a thing
ugly that should have been beautiful."</p>

<p>"I suppose you wouldn't have him because he didn't propose
romantically," said Aunt Elizabeth contemptuously.</p>

<p>"No. I think my real reason was that I felt sure he was the kind
of man who would give his wife a vacuum cleaner for a Christmas
present," vowed Emily.</p>

<p>"She will not take anything seriously," said Aunt Elizabeth in
despair.</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> think she is bewitched," said Uncle Wallace. "She
hasn't had one decent beau this summer. She's so temperamental
decent fellows are scared of her."</p>

<p>"She's getting a terrible reputation as a flirt," mourned Aunt
Ruth. "It's no wonder nobody worth while will have anything to do
with her.</p>

<p>"Always with some fantastic love-affair on hand," snapped Uncle
Wallace. The clan felt that Uncle Wallace had, with unusual
felicity, hit on the very word. Emily's "love-affairs" were never
the conventional, decorous things Murray love-affairs should be.
They were indeed fantastic.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>But Emily always blessed her stars that none of the clan except
Aunt Elizabeth ever knew anything about the most fantastic of them
all. If they had they would have thought her temperamental with a
vengeance.</p>

<p>It all came about in a simple, silly way. The editor of the
Charlottetown <i>Argus,</i> a daily paper with some pretensions to
literature, had selected from an old U. S. newspaper a certain
uncopyrighted story of several chapters&mdash;<i>A Royal
Betrothal,</i> by some unknown author, <i>Mark Greaves,</i> for
reprinting in the special edition of <i>The Argus,</i> devoted to
"boosting" the claims of Prince Edward Island as a summer resort.
His staff was small and the compositors had been setting up the
type for the special edition at odd moments for a month and had it
all ready except the concluding chapter of <i>A Royal
Betrothal.</i> This chapter had disappeared and could not be found.
The editor was furious, but that did not help matters any. He could
not at that late hour find another story which would exactly fill
the space, nor was there time to set it up if he could. The special
edition must go to press in an hour. What was to be done?</p>

<p>At this moment Emily wandered in. She and Mr. Wilson were good
friends and she always called when in town.</p>

<p>"You're a godsend," said Mr. Wilson. "Will you do me a favour?"
He tossed the torn and dirty chapters of <i>A Royal Betrothal</i>
over to her. "For heaven's sake, get to work and write a concluding
chapter to that yarn. I'll give you half an hour. They can set it
up in another half-hour. And we'll have the darn thing out on
time."</p>

<p>Emily glanced hastily over the story. As far as it went there
was no hint of what "Mark Greaves" intended as a
<i>denouement.</i></p>

<p>"Have you any idea how it ended?" she asked.</p>

<p>"No, never read it," groaned Mr. Wilson. "Just picked it for its
length."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll do my best, though I'm not accustomed to write with
flippant levity of kings and queens," agreed Emily. "This Mark
Greaves, whoever he is, seems to be very much at home with
royalty."</p>

<p>"I'll bet he never even saw one," snorted Mr. Wilson.</p>

<p>In the half-hour allotted to her Emily produced a quite
respectable concluding chapter with a solution of the mystery which
was really ingenious. Mr. Wilson snatched it with an air of relief
handed it to a compositor, and bowed Emily out with thanks.</p>

<p>"I wonder if any of the readers will notice where the seam comes
in," reflected Emily amusedly. "And I wonder if Mark Greaves will
ever see it and if so what he will think."</p>

<p>It did not seem in the least likely she would ever know and she
dismissed the matter from her mind. Consequently when, one
afternoon two weeks later, Cousin Jimmy ushered a stranger into the
sitting-room where Emily was arranging roses in Aunt Elizabeth's
rock-crystal goblet with its ruby base&mdash;a treasured heirloom
of New Moon&mdash;Emily did not connect him with <i>A Royal
Betrothal,</i> though she had a distinct impression that the caller
was an exceedingly irate man.</p>

<p>Cousin Jimmy discreetly withdrew and Aunt Laura, who had come in
to place a glass dish full of strawberry preserves on the table to
cool, withdrew also, wondering a little who Emily's odd-looking
caller could be. Emily herself wondered. She remained standing by
the table, a slim, gracious thing in her pale-green gown, shining
like a star in the shadowy, old-fashioned room.</p>

<p>"Won't you sit down?" she questioned with all the aloof courtesy
of New Moon. But the newcomer did not move. He simply stood before
her staring at her. And again Emily felt that, while he had been
quite furious when he came in, he was not in the least angry
now.</p>

<p>He must have been born, of course, because he was
there&mdash;but it was incredible, she thought, he could ever have
been a baby. He wore audacious clothes and a monocle, screwed into
one of his eyes&mdash;eyes that seemed absurdly like little black
currants with black eyebrows that made right-angled triangles above
them. He had a mane of black hair reaching to his shoulders, an
immensely long chin and a marble-white face. In a picture Emily
thought he would have looked rather handsome and romantic. But here
in the New Moon sitting-room he looked merely weird.</p>

<p>"Lyrical creature," he said, gazing at her.</p>

<p>Emily wondered if he were by any chance an escaped lunatic.</p>

<p>"You do not commit the crime of ugliness," he continued
fervently. "This is a wonderful moment&mdash;very wonderful. 'Tis a
pity we must spoil it by talking. Eyes of purple-grey, sprinkled
with gold. Eyes that I have looked for all my life. Sweet eyes, in
which I drowned myself eons ago."</p>

<p>"Who are you?" said Emily crisply, now entirely convinced that
he was quite mad. He laid his hand on his heart and bowed.</p>

<p>"Mark Greaves&mdash;Mark D. Greaves&mdash;Mark Delage
Greaves."</p>

<p>Mark Greaves! Emily had a confused idea that she ought to know
the name. It sounded curiously familiar.</p>

<p>"Is it possible you do not recognize my name! Verily this is
fame. Even in this remote corner of the world I should have
supposed&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh," cried Emily, light suddenly breaking on her. "I&mdash;I
remember now. You wrote <i>A Royal Betrothal."</i></p>

<p>"The story you so unfeelingly murdered&mdash;yes."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm so sorry," Emily interrupted. "Of course you would
think it unpardonable. It was this way&mdash;you see&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped her by a wave of a very long, very white hand.</p>

<p>"No matter. No matter. It does not interest me at all now. I
admit I was very angry when I came here. I am stopping at the Derry
Pond Hotel of The Dunes&mdash;ah, what a
name&mdash;poetry&mdash;mystery&mdash;romance&mdash;and I saw the
special edition of <i>The Argus</i> this morning. I was
angry&mdash;had I not a right to be?&mdash;and yet more sad than
angry. My story was barbarously mutilated. A happy ending.
Horrible. <i>My</i> ending was sorrowful and artistic. A happy
ending can never be artistic. I hastened to the den of <i>The
Argus.</i> I dissembled my anger&mdash;I discovered who was
responsible. I came here&mdash;to denounce&mdash;to upbraid. I
remain to worship."</p>

<p>Emily simply did not know what to say. New Moon traditions held
no precedent for this.</p>

<p>"You do not understand me. You are puzzled&mdash;your
bewilderment becomes you. Again I say a wonderful moment. To come
enraged&mdash;and behold divinity. To realize as soon as I saw you
that you were meant for me and me alone."</p>

<p>Emily wished somebody would come in. This was getting
nightmarish.</p>

<p>"It is absurd to talk so," she said shortly. "We are
strangers&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We are <i>not</i> strangers," he interrupted. "We have loved in
some other life, of course. And our love was a violent, gorgeous
thing&mdash;a love of eternity. I recognized you as soon as I
entered. As soon as you have recovered from your sweet surprise you
will realize this, too. When can you marry me?"</p>

<p>To be asked by a man to marry him five minutes after the first
moment you have laid eyes on him is an experience more stimulating
than pleasant. Emily was annoyed.</p>

<p>"Don't talk nonsense, please," she said curtly. "I am not going
to marry you at any time."</p>

<p>"Not marry me? But you must! I have never before asked a woman
to marry me. I am the famous Mark Greaves. I am rich. I have the
charm and romance of my French mother and the common-sense of my
Scotch father. With the French side of me I feel and acknowledge
your beauty and mystery. With the Scotch side of me I bow in homage
to your reserve and dignity. You are ideal&mdash;adorable. Many
women have loved me but I loved them not. I enter this room a free
man. I go out a captive. Enchanting captivity! Adorable captor! I
kneel before you in spirit."</p>

<p>Emily was horribly afraid he would kneel before her in the
flesh. He looked quite capable of it. And suppose Aunt Elizabeth
should come in.</p>

<p>"Please go away," she said desperately. "I'm&mdash;I'm very busy
and I can't stop talking to you any longer. I'm sorry about the
story&mdash;if you would let me explain&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I have said it does not matter about the story. Though you must
learn never to write happy endings&mdash;never. I will teach you. I
will teach you the beauty and artistry of sorrow and
incompleteness. Ah, what a pupil you will be! What bliss to teach
such a pupil! I kiss your hand."</p>

<p>He made a step nearer as if to seize upon it. Emily stepped
backward in alarm.</p>

<p>"You <i>must</i> be crazy," she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Do I look crazy?" demanded Mr. Greaves.</p>

<p>"You do," retorted Emily flatly and cruelly.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I do&mdash;probably I do.
<i>Crazy</i>&mdash;intoxicated with wine of the rose. All lovers
are mad. Divine madness! Oh, beautiful, unkissed lips!"</p>

<p>Emily drew herself up. This absurd interview must end. She was
by now thoroughly angry.</p>

<p>"Mr. Greaves," she said&mdash;and such was the power of the
Murray look that Mr. Greaves realized she meant exactly what she
said. "I shan't listen to any more of this nonsense. Since you
won't let me explain about the matter of the story I bid you
good-afternoon."</p>

<p>Mr. Greaves looked gravely at her for a moment. Then he said
solemnly:</p>

<p>"A kiss? Or a kick? Which?"</p>

<p>Was he speaking metaphorically? But whether or no&mdash;</p>

<p>"A kick," said Emily disdainfully.</p>

<p>Mr. Greaves suddenly seized the crystal goblet and dashed it
violently against the stove.</p>

<p>Emily uttered a faint shriek&mdash;partly of real
terror&mdash;partly of dismay. Aunt Elizabeth's treasured
goblet.</p>

<p>"That was merely a defence reaction," said Mr. Greaves, glaring
at her. "I had to do that&mdash;or kill you. Ice-maiden! Chill
vestal! Cold as your northern snows! Farewell."</p>

<p>He did not slam the door as he went out. He merely shut it
gently and irrevocably, so that Emily might realize what she had
lost. When she saw that he was really out of the garden and
marching indignantly down the lane as if he were crushing something
beneath his feet, she permitted herself the relief of a long
breath&mdash;the first she had dared to draw since his
entrance.</p>

<p>"I suppose," she said, half hysterically, "that I ought to be
thankful he did not throw the dish of strawberry preserves at
me."</p>

<p>Aunt Elizabeth came in.</p>

<p>"Emily, the rock-crystal goblet! Your Grandmother Murray's
goblet! And you have broken it!"</p>

<p>"No, really. Aunty dear, I didn't. Mr. Greaves&mdash;Mr. Mark
Delage Greaves did it. He threw it at the stove."</p>

<p>"Threw it at the stove!" Aunt Elizabeth was staggered. "Why did
he throw it at the stove?"</p>

<p>"Because I wouldn't marry him," said Emily.</p>

<p>"Marry him! Did you ever see him before?"</p>

<p>"Never."</p>

<p>Aunt Elizabeth gathered up the fragments of the crystal goblet
and went out quite speechless. There was&mdash;there must
be&mdash;something wrong with a girl when a man proposed marriage
to her at first meeting. And hurled heirloom goblets at inoffensive
stoves.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>But it was the affair of the Japanese prince which really gave
the Murrays their bad summer.</p>

<p>Second-cousin Louise Murray, who had lived in Japan for twenty
years, came home to Derry Pond for a visit and brought with her a
young Japanese prince, the son of a friend of her husband's, who
had been converted to Christianity by her efforts and wished to see
something of Canada. His mere coming made a tremendous sensation in
the clan and the community. But that was nothing to the next
sensation when they realized that the prince had evidently and
unmistakably fallen terrifically in love with Emily Byrd Starr of
New Moon.</p>

<p>Emily liked him&mdash;was interested in him&mdash;was sorry for
him in his bewildered reactions to the Presbyterian atmosphere of
Derry Pond and Blair Water. Naturally a Japanese prince, even a
converted one, couldn't feel exactly at home. So she talked a great
deal to him&mdash;he could talk English excellently&mdash;and
walked with him at moonrise in the garden&mdash;and almost every
evening that slant-eyed, inscrutable face, with the black hair
brushed straight back from it as smooth as satin, might be seen in
the parlour of New Moon.</p>

<p>But it was not until he gave Emily a little frog beautifully cut
out of moss agate that the Murrays took alarm. Cousin Louise
sounded it first. Tearfully. <i>She</i> knew what that frog meant.
Those agate frogs were heirlooms in the family of the prince. Never
were they given away save as marriage and betrothal gifts. Was
Emily engaged&mdash;to him? Aunt Ruth, looking as usual as if she
thought everyone had gone mad, came over to New Moon and made quite
a scene. It annoyed Emily so much that she refused to answer any
questions. She was a bit edgy to begin with over the unnecessary
way her clan had heckled her all summer over suitors that were not
of her choosing and whom there was not the slightest danger of her
taking seriously.</p>

<p>"There are some things not good for you to know," she told Aunt
Ruth impertinently.</p>

<p>And the distracted Murrays despairingly concluded that she had
decided to be a Japanese princess. And if she had&mdash;well, they
knew what happened when Emily made up her mind. It was something
inevitable&mdash;like a visitation of God; but it was a dreadful
thing. His Princeship cast no halo about him in the Murray eyes. No
Murray before her would ever have dreamed of marrying any
foreigner, much less a Japanese. But then of course she was
temperamental.</p>

<p>"Always with some disreputable creature in tow," said Aunt Ruth.
"But this beats everything I ever feared. A
pagan&mdash;a&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, he isn't <i>that,</i> Ruth," mourned Aunt Laura. "He is
converted&mdash;Cousin Louise says she is sure he is sincere,
but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I tell you he's a pagan!" reiterated Aunt Ruth. "Cousin Louise
could never convert anybody. Why, she's none too sound herself. And
her husband is a modernist if he's <i>anything.</i> Don't tell me!
A yellow pagan! Him and his agate frogs!"</p>

<p>"She seems to have such an attraction for extraordinary men,"
said Aunt Elizabeth, thinking of the rock-crystal goblet.</p>

<p>Uncle Wallace said it was preposterous. Andrew said she might at
least have picked on a white man. Cousin Louise, who felt that the
clan blamed <i>her</i> for it all, pleaded tearfully that he had
beautiful manners when you really knew him.</p>

<p>"And she might have had the Reverend James Wallace," said Aunt
Elizabeth.</p>

<p>They lived through five weeks of this and then the prince went
back to Japan. He had been summoned home by his family, Cousin
Louise said&mdash;a marriage had been arranged for him with a
princess of an old Samurai family. Of course he had obeyed; but he
left the agate frog in Emily's possession and nobody ever knew just
what he said to her one night at moonrise in the garden. Emily was
a little white and strange and remote when she came in, but she
smiled impishly at her aunts and Cousin Louise.</p>

<p>"So I'm not to be a Japanese princess after all," she said,
wiping away some imaginary tears.</p>

<p>"Emily, I fear you've only been flirting with that poor boy,"
rebuked Cousin Louise. "You have made him very unhappy."</p>

<p>"I wasn't flirting. Our conversations were about literature and
history&mdash;mostly. He will never think of me again."</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> know what he looked like when he read that letter,"
retorted Cousin Louise. "And I know the significance of agate
frogs."</p>

<p>New Moon drew a breath of relief and thankfully settled down to
routine again. Aunt Laura's old, tender eyes lost their troubled
look, but Aunt Elizabeth thought sadly of the Rev. James Wallace.
It had been a nerve-racking summer. Blair Water whispered about,
that Emily Starr had been "disappointed," but predicted she would
live to be thankful for it. You couldn't trust them foreigners. Not
likely he was a prince at all.</p>

<hr><h2><a name="C18" id="C18"><i>Chapter XVIII</i></a>
</h2>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>One day in the last week of October Cousin Jimmy began to plough
the hill field, Emily found the lost legendary diamond of the
Murrays,* and Aunt Elizabeth fell down the cellar steps and broke
her leg.</p>

<p>*See <i>Emily of New Moon.</i></p>

<p>Emily, in the warm amber of the afternoon, stood on the
sandstone front steps of New Moon and looked about her with eyes
avid for the mellow loveliness of the fading year. Most of the
trees were leafless, but a little birch, still in golden array,
peeped out of the young spruces&mdash;a birch <i>Danae</i> in their
shadows&mdash;and the Lombardies down the lane were like a row of
great golden candles. Beyond was the sere hill field scarfed with
three bright red ribbons&mdash;the "ridges" Cousin Jimmy had
ploughed. Emily had been writing all day and she was tired. She
went down the garden to the little vine-hung summer house&mdash;she
poked dreamily about; deciding where the new tulip bulbs should be
planted. Here&mdash;in this moist rich soil where Cousin Jimmy had
recently pried out the mouldering old side-steps. Next spring it
should be a banquet board laden with stately chalices. Emily's heel
sank deeply into the moist earth and came out laden. She sauntered
over to the stone bench and daintily scraped off the earth with a
twig. Something fell and glittered on the grass like a dewdrop.
Emily picked it up with a little cry. There in her hand was the
Lost Diamond&mdash;lost over sixty years before, when Great-aunt
Miriam Murray had gone into the summer house.</p>

<p>It had been one of her childish dreams to find the Lost
Diamond&mdash;she and Ilse and Teddy had hunted for it scores of
times. But of late years she had not thought about it. And here it
was&mdash;as bright, as beautiful, as ever. It must have been
hidden in some crevice of the old side-steps and fallen to the
earth when they had been torn away. It made quite a sensation at
New Moon. A few days later the Murrays had a conclave about Aunt
Elizabeth's bed to decide what should be done with it. Cousin Jimmy
said stoutly that finding was keeping in this case. Edward and
Miriam Murray were long since dead. They had left no family. The
diamond by rights was Emily's.</p>

<p>"We are all heirs to it," said Uncle Wallace judicially. "It
cost, I've heard, a thousand dollars sixty years ago. It's a
beautiful stone. The fair thing is to sell it and give Emily her
mother's share."</p>

<p>"One shouldn't sell a family diamond," said Aunt Elizabeth
firmly.</p>

<p>This seemed to be the general opinion at bottom. Even Uncle
Wallace acknowledged the sway of <i>noblesse oblige.</i> Eventually
they all agreed that the diamond should be Emily's.</p>

<p>"She can have it set as a little pendant for her neck," said
Aunt Laura.</p>

<p>"It was meant for a ring," said Aunt Ruth, just for the sake of
disagreeing. "And she shouldn't wear it, in any case, until she is
married. A diamond as big as that is in bad taste for a young
girl."</p>

<p>"Oh, married!" Aunt Addie gave a rather nasty little laugh. It
conveyed her opinion that if Emily waited for that to wear the
diamond it was just possible she might never wear it. Aunt Addie
had never forgiven Emily for refusing Andrew. And here she was at
twenty-three&mdash;well, nearly&mdash;with no eligible beau in
sight.</p>

<p>"The Lost Diamond will bring you luck, Emily," said Cousin
Jimmy. "I'm glad they've left it with you. It's rightly yours. But
will you let me hold it sometimes, Emily,&mdash;just hold it and
look into it. When I look into anything like that
I&mdash;I&mdash;find myself. I'm not simple Jimmy Murray
then&mdash;I'm what I would have been if I hadn't been pushed into
a well. Don't say anything about it to Elizabeth, Emily, but just
let me hold it and look at it once in awhile."</p>

<p>"My favourite gem is the diamond, when all is said and done,"
Emily wrote to Ilse that night. "But I love gems of all
kinds&mdash;except turquoise. Them I loathe&mdash;the shallow,
insipid, soulless things. The gloss of pearl, glow of ruby,
tenderness of sapphire, melting violet of amethyst, moonlit glimmer
of acquamarine, milk and fire of opal&mdash;I love them all."</p>

<p>"What about emeralds?" Ilse wrote back&mdash;a bit nastily,
Emily thought, not knowing that a Shrewsbury correspondent of
Ilse's wrote her now and then some unreliable gossip about Perry
Miller's visits to New Moon. Perry did come to New Moon
occasionally. But he had given up asking Emily to marry him and
seemed wholly absorbed in his profession. Already he was regarded
as a coming man and shrewd politicians were said to be biding their
time until he should be old enough to "bring out" as a candidate
for the Provincial House.</p>

<p>"Who knows? You may be 'my lady' yet," wrote Ilse, "Perry will
be Sir Perry some day."</p>

<p>Which Emily thought was even nastier than the scratch about the
emerald.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>At first it did not seem that the Lost Diamond had brought luck
to any one at New Moon. The very evening of its finding Aunt
Elizabeth broke her leg. Shawled and bonnetted for a call on a sick
neighbour&mdash;bonnets had long gone out of fashion even for
elderly ladies, but Aunt Elizabeth wore them still&mdash;she had
started down cellar to get a jar of black currant jam for the
invalid, had tripped in some way and fallen. When she was taken up
it was found that her leg was broken and Aunt Elizabeth faced the
fact that for the first time in her life she was to spend weeks in
bed.</p>

<p>Of course New Moon got on without her, though she believed it
couldn't. But the problem of amusing her was a more serious one
than the running of New Moon. Aunt Elizabeth fretted and pined over
her enforced inactivity&mdash;could not read much
herself&mdash;didn't like to be read to&mdash;was sure everything
was going to the dogs&mdash;was sure she was going to be lame and
useless all the rest of her life&mdash;was sure Dr. Burnley was an
old fool&mdash;was sure Laura would never get the apples packed
properly&mdash;was sure the hired boy would cheat Cousin Jimmy.</p>

<p>"Would you like to hear the little story I finished to-day, Aunt
Elizabeth?" asked Emily one evening. "It might amuse you."</p>

<p>"Is there any silly love-making in it?" demanded Aunt Elizabeth
ungraciously.</p>

<p>"No love-making of any kind. It's pure comedy."</p>

<p>"Well, let me hear it. It may pass the time."</p>

<p>Emily read the story. Aunt Elizabeth made no comment whatever.
But the next afternoon she said, hesitatingly, "Is there&mdash;any
more&mdash;of that story you read last night?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Well, if there was&mdash;I wouldn't mind hearing it. It kind of
took my thoughts away from myself. The folks seemed&mdash;sort
of&mdash;real to me. I suppose that is why I feel as if I want to
know what happens to them," concluded Aunt Elizabeth as if
apologizing for her weakness.</p>

<p>"I'll write another story about them for you," promised
Emily.</p>

<p>When this was read Aunt Elizabeth remarked that she didn't care
if she heard a third one.</p>

<p>"Those <i>Applegaths</i> are amusing," she said. "I've known
people like them. And that little chap, <i>Jerry Stowe.</i> What
happens to him when he grows up, poor child?"</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>Emily's idea came to her that evening as she sat idly by her
window looking rather drearily out on cold meadows and hills of
grey, over which a chilly, lonesome wind blew. She could hear the
dry leaves blowing over the garden wall. A few great white flakes
were beginning to come down.</p>

<p>She had had a letter from Ilse that day. Teddy's picture, <i>The
Smiling Girl,</i> which had been exhibited in Montreal and had made
a tremendous sensation, had been accepted by the Paris
<i>Salon.</i></p>

<p>"I just got back from the coast in time to see the last day of
its exhibition here," wrote Ilse. "And it's
you&mdash;Emily&mdash;it's you. Just that old sketch he made of you
years ago completed and glorified&mdash;the one your Aunt Nancy
made you so mad by keeping&mdash;remember? There you were smiling
down from Teddy's canvas. The critics had a great deal to say about
his colouring and technique and 'feeling' and all that sort of
jargon. But one said, 'The smile on the girl's face will become as
famous as Mona Lisa's.' I've seen that very smile on your face a
hundred times, Emily&mdash;especially when you were seeing that
unseeable thing you used to call your flash. Teddy has caught the
very soul of it&mdash;not a mocking, challenging smile like Mona
Lisa's&mdash;but a smile that seems to hint at some exquisitely
wonderful secret you could tell if you liked&mdash;some whisper
eternal&mdash;a secret that would make every one happy if they
could only get you to tell it. It's only a trick, I
suppose&mdash;<i>you</i> don't know that secret any more than the
rest of us. But the smile suggests that you do&mdash;suggests it
marvellously. Yes, your Teddy has genius&mdash;that smile proves
it. What does it feel like, Emily, to realize yourself the
inspiration of a genius? I'd give years of my life for such a
compliment."</p>

<p>Emily didn't quite know what it felt like. But she did feel a
certain small, futile anger with Teddy. What right had he who
scorned her love and was indifferent to her friendship to paint her
face&mdash;her soul&mdash;her secret vision&mdash;and hang it up
for the world to gaze at? To be sure, he had told her in childhood
that he meant to do it&mdash;and she had agreed then. But
everything had changed since then. Everything.</p>

<p>Well, about this story, regarding which Aunt Elizabeth had such
an Oliver Twist complex. Suppose she were to write another
one&mdash;suddenly the idea came. Suppose she were to expand it
into a book. Not like <i>A Seller of Dreams,</i> of course. That
old glory could come back no more. But Emily had an instantaneous
vision of the new book, as a whole&mdash;a witty, sparkling rill of
human comedy. She ran down to Aunt Elizabeth.</p>

<p>"Aunty, how would you like me to write a book for you about
those people in my story? Just for you&mdash;a chapter every
day."</p>

<p>Aunt Elizabeth carefully hid the fact that she was
interested.</p>

<p>"Oh, you can if you want to. I wouldn't mind hearing about them.
But mind, you are not to put any of the neighbours in."</p>

<p>Emily didn't put any of the neighbours in&mdash;she didn't need
to. Characters galore trooped into her consciousness, demanding a
local habitation and a name. They laughed and scowled and wept and
danced&mdash;and even made a little love. Aunt Elizabeth tolerated
this, supposing you couldn't have a novel without some of it. Emily
read a chapter every evening, and Aunt Laura and Cousin Jimmy were
allowed to hear it along with Aunt Elizabeth. Cousin Jimmy was in
raptures. He was sure it was the most wonderful story ever
written.</p>

<p>"I feel young again when I'm listening to you," he said.</p>

<p>"Sometimes I want to laugh and sometimes I want to cry,"
confessed Aunt Laura. "I can't sleep for wondering what is going to
happen to the <i>Applegaths</i> in the next chapter."</p>

<p>"It might be worse," conceded Aunt Elizabeth. "But I wish you'd
cut out what you said about <i>Gloria Applegath's</i> greasy
dish-towels. Mrs. Charlie Frost of Derry Pond, will think you mean
her. Her towels are always greasy."</p>

<p>"Chips are bound to light somewhere," said Cousin Jimmy.
<i>"Gloria</i> is funny in a book, but she'd be awful to live with.
Too busy saving the world. Somebody ought to tell her to read her
Bible."</p>

<p>"I don't like <i>Cissy Applegath,</i> though," said Aunt Laura
apologetically. "She has such a supercilious way of speaking."</p>

<p>"A shallow-pated creature," said Aunt Elizabeth.</p>

<p>"It's old <i>Jesse Applegath</i> I can't tolerate," said Cousin
Jimmy fiercely. "A man who would kick a cat just to relieve his
feelings! I'd go twenty miles to slap the old he-devil's face.
But"&mdash;hopefully&mdash;"maybe he'll die before long."</p>

<p>"Or reform," suggested Aunt Laura mercifully.</p>

<p>"No, no, don't let him reform," said Cousin Jimmy anxiously.
"Kill him off, if necessary, but don't reform him. I wish, though,
you'd change the colour of <i>Peg Applegath's</i> eyes. I don't
like green eyes&mdash;never did."</p>

<p>"But I can't change them. They <i>are</i> green," protested
Emily.</p>

<p>"Well, then, <i>Abraham Applegath's</i> whiskers," pleaded
Cousin Jimmy. "I like <i>Abraham.</i> He's a gay dog. Can't he help
his whiskers, Emily?"</p>

<p>"No"&mdash;firmly&mdash;"he can't."</p>

<p>Why couldn't they understand? Abraham <i>had</i>
whiskers&mdash;<i>wanted</i> whiskers&mdash;was determined to have
whiskers. <i>She</i> couldn't change him.</p>

<p>"It's time we remembered that these people have no real
existence," rebuked Aunt Elizabeth.</p>

<p>But once&mdash;Emily counted it her greatest triumph&mdash;Aunt
Elizabeth laughed. She was so ashamed of it she would not even
smile all the rest of the reading.</p>

<p>"Elizabeth thinks God doesn't like to hear us laugh," Cousin
Jimmy whispered behind his hand to Laura. If Elizabeth had not been
lying there with a broken leg Laura would have smiled. But to smile
under the circumstances seemed like taking an unfair advantage of
her.</p>

<p>Cousin Jimmy went downstairs shaking his head and murmuring,
<i>"How</i> does she do it? How <i>does</i> she do it! I can write
poetry&mdash;but <i>this.</i> Those folks are alive!"</p>

<p>One of them was too much alive in Aunt Elizabeth's opinion.</p>

<p>"That <i>Nicholas Applegath</i> is too much like old Douglas
Courcy, of Shrewsbury," she said. "I told you not to put any people
we knew in it."</p>

<p>"Why, I never saw Douglas Courcy."</p>

<p>"It's him to the life. Even Jimmy noticed it. You must cut him
out, Emily."</p>

<p>But Emily obstinately refused to "cut him out." Old
<i>Nicholas</i> was one of the best characters in her book. She was
very much absorbed in it by this time. The composition of it was
never the ecstatic rite the creation of <i>A Seller of Dreams</i>
had been, but it was very fascinating. She forgot all vexing and
haunting things while she was writing it. The last chapter was
finished the very day the splints were taken off Aunt Elizabeth's
leg and she was carried down to the kitchen lounge.</p>

<p>"Well, your story has helped," she admitted. "But I'm thankful
to be where I can keep my eye on things once more. What are you
going to do with your book? What are you going to call it?"</p>

<p><i>"The Moral of the Rose."</i>
</p>

<p>"I don't think that is a good title at all. I don't know what it
means&mdash;nobody will know."</p>

<p>"No matter. That is the book's name."</p>

<p>Aunt Elizabeth sighed.</p>

<p>"I don't know where you get your stubbornness from, Emily. I'm
sure I don't. You never would take advice. And I know the Courcys
will never speak to us again, after the book is published."</p>

<p>"The book hasn't any chance of being published," said Emily
gloomily. "They'll send it back, 'damned with faint praise.'"</p>

<p>Aunt Elizabeth had never heard this expression before and she
thought Emily had originated it and was being profane.</p>

<p>"Emily," she said sternly, "don't let me ever hear such a word
from your lips again. I've more than suspected Ilse of such
language&mdash;that poor girl never got over her early bringing
up&mdash;she's not to be judged by <i>our</i> standards. But
Murrays of New Moon do <i>not</i> swear."</p>

<p>"It was only a quotation, Aunt Elizabeth," said Emily
wearily.</p>

<p>She was tired&mdash;a little tired of everything. It was
Christmas now and a long, dreary winter stretched before
her&mdash;an empty, aimless winter. Nothing seemed worth
while&mdash;not even finding a publisher for <i>The Moral of the
Rose.</i></p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>However, she typewrote it faithfully and sent it out. It came
back. She sent it out again, three times. It came back. She retyped
it&mdash;the MS. was getting dog-eared&mdash;and sent it out again.
At intervals all that winter and summer she sent it out, working
doggedly through a list of possible publishers. I forget how many
times she retyped it. It became a sort of a joke&mdash;a bitter
joke.</p>

<p>The worst of it was that the New Moon folk knew of all these
rejections and their sympathy and indignation were hard to bear.
Cousin Jimmy was so angry over every rejection of this masterpiece
that he could not eat for a day afterwards and she gave up telling
him of the journeys. Once she thought of sending it to Miss Royal
and asking her if she had any influence to use. But the Murray
pride would not brook the idea. Finally in the autumn when it
returned from the last publisher on her list Emily did not even
open the parcel. She cast it contemptuously into a compartment of
her desk.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Too sick at heart to war<br>
With failure any more.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>"That's the end of it&mdash;and of all my dreams. I'll use it up
for scribbling paper. And now I'll settle down to a tepid existence
of pot-boiling."</p>

<p>As least magazine editors were more appreciative than book
publishers&mdash;as Cousin Jimmy indignantly said, they appeared to
have more sense. While her book was seeking vainly for its chance
her magazine clientele grew daily. She spent long hours at her desk
and enjoyed her work after a fashion. But there was a little
consciousness of failure under it all. She could never get much
higher on the Alpine path. The glorious city of fulfilment on its
summit was not for her. Pot-boiling! That was all. Making a living
in what Aunt Elizabeth thought was a shamefully easy way.</p>

<p>Miss Royal wrote her frankly that she was falling off.</p>

<p>"You're getting into a rut, Emily," she warned, "A
self-satisfied rut. The admiration of Aunt Laura and Cousin Jimmy
is a bad thing for you. You should be <i>here</i>&mdash;we would
keep you up to the scratch."</p>

<p>Suppose she had gone to New York with Miss Royal when she had
the chance six years ago. Would she not have been able to get her
book published? Was it not the fatal Prince Edward Island postmark
that condemned it&mdash;the little out-of-the-world province from
which no good thing could ever come?</p>

<p>Perhaps! Perhaps Miss Royal had been right. But what did it
matter?</p>

<p>No one came to Blair Water that summer. That is&mdash;Teddy Kent
did not come. Ilse was in Europe again. Dean Priest seemed to have
taken up his residence permanently at the Pacific Coast. Life at
New Moon went on unchanged. Except that Aunt Elizabeth limped a
little and Cousin Jimmy's hair turned white quite suddenly,
overnight as it seemed. Now and then Emily had a quick, terrible
vision that Cousin Jimmy was growing old. They were all growing
old. Aunt Elizabeth was nearly seventy. And when she died New Moon
went to Andrew. Already there were times when Andrew seemed to be
putting on proprietary airs in his visits to New Moon. Not that he
would ever live there himself, of course. But it ought to be kept
in good shape against the day when it would be necessary to sell
it.</p>

<p>"It's time those old Lombardies were cut down," said Andrew to
Uncle Oliver one day. "They're getting frightfully ragged at the
tops. Lombardies are so out of date now. And that field with the
young spruces should be drained and ploughed."</p>

<p>"That old orchard should be cleared out," said Uncle Oliver.
"It's more like a jungle than an orchard. The trees are too old for
any good anyhow. They should all be chopped down. Jimmy and
Elizabeth are too old-fashioned. They don't make half the money out
of this farm they should."</p>

<p>Emily, overhearing this, clenched her fists. To see New Moon
desecrated&mdash;her old, intimate, beloved trees cut
down&mdash;the spruce field where wild strawberries grew improved
out of existence&mdash;dreamy beauty of the old orchard
destroyed&mdash;the little dells and slopes that kept all the
ghostly joys of her past changed&mdash;altered. It was
unbearable.</p>

<p>"If you had married Andrew New Moon would have been yours," said
Aunt Elizabeth bitterly, when she found Emily crying over what they
had said.</p>

<p>"But the changes would have come just the same," said Emily.
"Andrew wouldn't have listened to me. He believes that the husband
is the head of the wife."</p>

<p>"You will be twenty-four your next birthday," said Aunt
Elizabeth. Apropos of what?</p>

<p>"OCT. 1, 19&mdash;</p>

<p>"This afternoon I sat at my window and alternately wrote at my
new serial and watched a couple of dear, amusing, youngish
maple-trees at the foot of the garden. They whispered secrets to
each other all the afternoon. They would bend together and talk
earnestly for a few moments, then spring back and look at each
other, throwing up their hands comically in horror and amazement
over their mutual revelations. I wonder what new scandal is afoot
in Treeland."</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>"OCT. 10, 19&mdash;</p>

<p>"This evening was lovely. I went up on the hill and walked about
until twilight had deepened into an autumn night with a benediction
of starry quietude over it. I was alone but not lonely. I was a
queen in halls of fancy. I held a series of conversations with
imaginary comrades and thought out so many epigrams that I was
agreeably surprised at myself."</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>"OCT. 28, 19&mdash;</p>

<p>"To-night I was out for one of my long walks. In a weird,
purple, shadowy world, with great, cold clouds piling up above a
yellow sky, hills brooding in the silence of forsaken woods, ocean
tumbling on a rocky shore. The whole landscape seemed</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As those who wait<br>
Till judgment speak the doom of fate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>"It made me feel&mdash;horribly <i>alone.</i></p>

<p>"What a creature of moods I am!</p>

<p>"'Fickle,' as Aunt Elizabeth says? Temperamental,' as Andrew
says?"</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>"NOV. 5, 19&mdash;</p>

<p>"What a fit of bad temper the world has indulged in! Day before
yesterday she was not unbeautiful&mdash;a dignified old dame in
fitting garb of brown and ermine. Yesterday she tried to ape
juvenility, putting on all the airs and graces of spring, with
scarfs of blue hazes. And what a bedraggled and uncomely old hag
she was, all tatters and wrinkles. She grew peevish then over her
own ugliness and has raged all night and day. I awakened up in the
wee sma's and heard the wind shrieking in the trees and tears of
rage and spite sleeting against the pane."</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p>"NOV. 23, 19&mdash;</p>

<p>"This is the second day of a heavy, ceaseless autumn rain.
Really, it has rained almost every day this November. We had no
mail to-day. The outside world is a dismal one, with drenched and
dripping trees and sodden fields. And the damp and gloom have crept
into my soul and spirit and sapped out all life and energy.</p>

<p>"I could not read, eat, sleep, write or do anything, unless I
drove myself to do it and then I felt as if I were trying to do it
with somebody else's hands or brain and couldn't work very well
with them. I feel lustreless, dowdy and uninviting&mdash;I even
bore myself.</p>

<p>"I shall grow mossy in this existence!</p>

<p>"There! I feel better for that little outburst of discontent. It
has ejected something from my system. I know that into everybody's
life must come some days of depression and discouragement when all
things in life seem to lose savour. The sunniest day has its
clouds; but one must not forget that the sun is there all the
time.</p>

<p>"How easy it is to be a philosopher&mdash;on paper!</p>

<p>"(Item:&mdash;If you are out in a cold, pouring rain, does it
keep you dry to remember that the sun is there just the same?)</p>

<p>"Well, thank heaven no two days are ever <i>exactly</i>
alike!"</p>

<h3>VI</h3>

<p>"DEC. 3, 19&mdash;</p>

<p>"There was a stormy, unrestful sunset to-night, behind the pale,
blanched hills, gleaming angrily through the Lombardies and the
dark fir-boughs in Lofty John's bush, that were now and again
tossed suddenly and distressfully in a fitful gust of wind. I sat
at my window and watched it. Below in the garden it was quite dark
and I could only see dimly the dead leaves that were whirling and
dancing uncannily over the flowerless paths. The poor dead
leaves&mdash;yet not quite dead, it seemed. There was still enough
unquiet life left in them to make them restless and forlorn. They
harkened yet to every call of the wind, which cared for them no
longer but only played freakishly with them and broke their rest. I
felt sorry for the leaves as I watched them in the dull, weird
twilight, and angry&mdash;in a petulant fashion that almost made me
laugh&mdash;with the wind that would not leave them in peace. Why
should they&mdash;and I&mdash;be vexed with these transient,
passionate breaths of desire for a life which has passed us by?</p>

<p>"I have not heard even from Ilse for a long time. She has
forgotten me, too."</p>

<h3>VII</h3>

<p>"JAN. 10, 19&mdash;</p>

<p>"As I came home from the post-office this evening&mdash;with
three acceptances&mdash;I revelled in the winter loveliness around
me. It was so very calm and still; the low sun cast such pure, pale
tints of pink and heliotrope over the snow; and the great,
pale-silver moon peeping over the Delectable Mountain was such a
friend of mine.</p>

<p>"How much difference in one's outlook three acceptances
make!"</p>

<h3>VIII</h3>

<p>"JAN. 20, 19&mdash;</p>

<p>"The nights are so dreary now and there is such a brief space of
grey, sunless day. I work and think all day and, when night comes
down early, gloom settles on my soul. I can't describe the feeling.
It is dreadful&mdash;worse than any actual pain. In so far as I can
express it in words I feel a great and awful weariness&mdash;not of
body or brain but of <i>feeling,</i> coupled with a haunting dread
of the future&mdash;<i>any</i> future&mdash;even a happy
one&mdash;nay, a happy one most of all, for in this strange mood it
seems to me that to be happy would require more effort&mdash;more
buoyancy than I shall possess. The fantastic shape my fear assumes
is that it would be <i>too much trouble</i> to be
happy&mdash;require too much energy.</p>

<p>"Let me be honest&mdash;in this journal if nowhere else. I know
quite well what is the matter with me. This afternoon I was
rummaging in my old trunk in the garret and found a packet of the
letters Teddy wrote the first year he was in Montreal. I was
foolish enough to sit down and read them all. It was a mad thing to
do. I am paying for it now. Such letters have a terrible
resurrective power. I am surrounded by bitter fancies and unbidden
ghosts&mdash;the little spectral joys of the past."</p>

<h3>IX</h3>

<p>"FEB. 5, 19&mdash;</p>

<p>"Life never seems the same to me as it used to. Something is
<i>gone.</i> I am not unhappy. But life seems a sort of negative
affair. I enjoy it on the whole and have many beautiful moments. I
have success&mdash;at least a sort of success&mdash;in growing
measure and a keen appreciation of all the world and the times
offer for delight and interest. But underneath it all is the
haunting sense of emptiness. This is all because 'full knee-deep
lies the winter snow' and I can't go a-prowling. Wait till a thaw
comes, when I can get out to the balm of the fir-trees and the
peace of the white places and the 'strength of the
hills'&mdash;what a beautiful old Biblical phrase that
is!&mdash;and I shall be made whole once more."</p>

<h3>X</h3>

<p>"FEB. 6, 19&mdash;</p>

<p>"Last night I simply could not endure any longer the vaseful of
dyed grasses on my mantelpiece. What if they had been there for
forty years! I seized them, opened the window and strewed them over
the lawn. This soothed me so that I slept like an infant. But this
morning Cousin Jimmy had gathered them all up and handed them
secretly back to me with a gentle warning not to let them 'blow
out' again. Elizabeth would be horrified.</p>

<p>"I put them back in the vase. One cannot escape one's
kismet."</p>

<h3>XI</h3>

<p>"FEB. 22, 19&mdash;</p>

<p>"There was a creamy, misty sunset this evening and then
moonlight. Such moonlight. It is such a night as one might fall
asleep in and dream happy dreams of gardens and songs and
companionship, feeling all the while through one's sleep the
splendour and radiance of the white moon-world outside as one hears
soft, far-away music sounding through the thoughts and words that
are born of it.</p>

<p>"I slipped away for a solitary walk through that fairy world of
glamour. I went through the orchard where the black shadows of the
trees fell over the snow&mdash;I went up to the gleaming white hill
with the stars over it, I lurked along fir copses dim with mystery
and along still, wood aisles where the night hid from the
moonshine, I loitered across a dreamland field of ebon and ivory. I
had a tryst with my friend of old days, the Wind Woman. And every
breath was a lyric and every thought an ecstasy and I've come back
with a soul washed white and clean in the great crystal bath of the
night.</p>

<p>"But Aunt Elizabeth said people would think me crazy if they saw
me roaming around alone at this hour of the night. And Aunt Laura
made me take a drink of hot black currant decoction lest I might
have taken cold. Only Cousin Jimmy partly understood.</p>

<p>"'You went out to escape. <i>I</i> know,' he whispered.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>'My soul has pastured with the stars<br>
Upon the meadowlands of space.'</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I whispered in return."</p>

<h3>XII</h3>

<p>"FEB. 26, 19&mdash;</p>

<p>"Jasper Frost has been coming out here from Shrewsbury of late.
I don't think he will come any more&mdash;after our conversation of
last night. He told me he loved me with a love 'that would last
through eternity.' But I thought an eternity with Jasper would be
rather long. Aunt Elizabeth will be a little disappointed, poor
dear. She likes Jasper and the Frosts are 'a good family.' I like
him, too, but he is too prim and bandboxy.</p>

<p>"'Would you like a slovenly beau?' demanded Aunt Elizabeth.</p>

<p>"This posed me. Because I wouldn't.</p>

<p>"'Surely there's a happy medium,' I protested.</p>

<p>"'A girl shouldn't be too particular when she is'&mdash;I feel
sure Aunt Elizabeth was going to say 'nearly twenty-four.' But she
changed it to 'not <i>entirely</i> perfect herself.'</p>

<p>"I wish Mr. Carpenter had been alive to hear Aunt Elizabeth's
italics. They were killing."</p>

<h3>XIII</h3>

<p>"MARCH 1, 19&mdash;</p>

<p>"A wonderful music of night is coming to my window from Lofty
John's bush. No, <i>not</i> Lofty John's bush any more.</p>

<p>"Emily Byrd Starr's bush!</p>

<p>"I bought it to-day, with the proceeds of my latest serial. And
it is mine&mdash;mine&mdash;mine. All the lovely things in it are
mine&mdash;its moonlit vistas&mdash;the grace of its one big elm
against the starlight&mdash;its shadowy little dells&mdash;its
June-bells and ferns&mdash;its crystalline spring&mdash;its wind
music sweeter than an old Cremona. No one can ever cut it down or
desecrate it in any way.</p>

<p>"I am so happy. The wind is my comrade and the evening star my
friend."</p>

<h3>XIV</h3>

<p>"MARCH 23, 19&mdash;</p>

<p>"Is there any sound in the world sadder and weirder than the
wail of the wind around the eaves and past the windows on a stormy
night? It sounds as if the broken-hearted cries of fair, unhappy
women who died and were forgotten ages ago were being re-echoed in
the moaning wind of to-night. All my own past pain finds a voice in
it as if it were moaning a plea for re-entrance into the soul that
has cast it out. There are strange sounds in that night wind
clamouring there at my little window. I hear the cries of old
sorrows in it&mdash;and the moans of old despairs&mdash;and the
phantom songs of dead hopes. The night wind is the wandering soul
of the past. It has no share in the future&mdash;and so it is
mournful."</p>

<h3>XV</h3>

<p>"APRIL 10, 19&mdash;</p>

<p>"This morning I felt more like myself than I have for a long
time. I was out for a walk over the Delectable Mountain. It was a
very mild, still, misty morning with lovely pearl-grey skies and
smell of spring in the air. Every turn and twist on that hill-road
was an old friend to me. And everything was so young. April
couldn't be old. The young spruces were so green and companionable
with pearl-like beads of moisture fringing their needles.</p>

<p>"'You are mine,' called the sea beyond Blair Water.</p>

<p>"'We have a share in her,' said the hills.</p>

<p>"'She is my sister,' said a jolly little fir-tree.</p>

<p>"Looking at them the flash came&mdash;my old supernal moment
that has come so sadly seldom these past dreary months. Will I lose
it altogether as I grow old? Will nothing but 'the light of common
day' be mine then?</p>

<p>"But at least it came to me this morning and I felt my
immortality. After all, freedom is a matter of the soul.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>'Nature never did betray the heart that loved her.'</p>
</blockquote>

<p>"She has always a gift of healing for us if we come humbly to
her. Corroding memories and discontents vanished. I felt suddenly
that some old gladness was yet waiting for me, just around the
curve of the hill.</p>

<p>"The frogs are singing to-night. Why is <i>frog</i> such a
funny, dear, charming, absurd word?"</p>

<h3>XVI</h3>

<p>"MAY 15, 19&mdash;</p>

<p>"I know that when I am dead I shall sleep peaceably enough under
the grasses through the summer and autumn and winter but when
spring comes my heart will throb and stir in my sleep and call
wistfully to all the voices calling far and wide in the world above
me. Spring and morning were laughing to each other to-day and I
went out to them and made a third.</p>

<p>"Ilse wrote to-day&mdash;a stingy little letter as far as news
went&mdash;and spoke of coming home.</p>

<p>"'I'm homesick,' she wrote. 'Are the wild birds still singing in
the Blair Water woods and are the waves still calling beyond the
dunes? I want them. And oh, to see the moon rise over the harbour
as we watched it do scores of times when we were children. And I
want to see you. Letters are so unsatisfactory. There are so many
things I'd like to talk over with you. Do you know I felt a little
<i>old</i> to-day. It was a curious sensation.'</p>

<p>"She never mentioned Teddy's name. But she asked 'Is it true
that Perry Miller is engaged to Judge Elmsley's daughter?'</p>

<p>"I don't think it is. But the mere report shows where Perry has
climbed to already."</p>

<p>On her twenty-fourth birthday Emily opened and read the letter
she had written "from herself at fourteen to herself at
twenty-four." It was not the amusing performance she had once
expected it to be. She sat long at her window with the letter in
her hand, watching the light of yellow, sinking stars over the bush
that was still called Lofty John's oftener than not, from old
habit. What would pop out when she opened that letter? A ghost of
first youth? Of ambition? Of vanished love? Of lost friendship?
Emily felt she would rather burn the letter than read it. But that
would be cowardly. One must face things&mdash;even ghosts. With a
sudden quick movement she cut open the envelope and took out the
letter.</p>

<p>A whiff of old fragrance came with it. Folded in it were some
dried rose-leaves&mdash;crisp brown things that crumbled to dust
under her touch. Yes, she remembered that rose&mdash;Teddy had
brought it to her one evening when they had been children together
and he had been so proud of that first red rose that bloomed on a
little house rose-bush Dr. Burnley had given him&mdash;the only
rose that ever did bloom on it, for that matter. His mother had
resented his love for the little plant. One night it was
accidentally knocked off the window-sill and broken. If Teddy
thought or knew there was any connection between the two facts he
never said so. Emily had kept the rose as long as possible in a
little vase on her study table; but the night she had written her
letter she had taken the limp, faded thing and folded it&mdash;with
a kiss&mdash;between the sheets of paper. She had forgotten that it
was there; and now it fell in her hand, faded, unbeautiful, like
the rose-hopes of long ago, yet with some faint bitter-sweetness
still about it. The whole letter seemed full of it&mdash;whether of
sense or spirit she could hardly tell.</p>

<p>This letter was, she sternly told herself, a foolish, romantic
affair. Something to be laughed at. Emily carefully laughed at some
parts of it. How crude&mdash;how silly&mdash;how
sentimental&mdash;how amusing! Had she really ever been young and
callow enough to write such flowery exultant nonsense? And one
would have thought, too, that fourteen regarded twenty-four as
verging on venerable.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Have you written your great book?" airily asked Fourteen in
conclusion. "Have you climbed to the very top of the Alpine Path?
Oh, Twenty-four, I'm envying you. It must be splendid to be
<i>you.</i> Are you looking back patronizingly and pityingly to
<i>me?</i> You wouldn't swing on a gate now, would you? Are you a
staid old married woman with several children, living in the
Disappointed House with One-You-Know-Of? Only <i>don't</i> be
stodgy, I implore you, dear Twenty-four. And do be dramatic. I love
dramatic things and people. Are you Mrs. &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;? What name will fill those blanks? Oh, dear
Twenty-four, I put into this letter for you a kiss&mdash;and a
handful of moonshine&mdash;and the soul of a rose&mdash;and some of
the green sweetness of the old hill field&mdash;and a whiff of wild
violets. I hope you are happy and famous and lovely; and I hope you
haven't quite forgotten</p>

<p>"Your foolish</p>

<p>"OLD SELF."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Emily locked the letter away.</p>

<p>"So much for that nonsense," she said scoffingly.</p>

<p>Then she sat down in her chair, and dropped her head on her
desk. Little silly, dreamy, happy, ignorant Fourteen! Always
thinking that something great and wonderful and beautiful lay in
the years ahead. Quite sure that the "mountain purple" could be
reached. Quite sure that dreams always came true. Foolish Fourteen,
who yet had known how to be happy.</p>

<p>"I'm envying <i>you,"</i> said Emily. "I wish I had never opened
your letter, foolish little Fourteen. Go back to your shadowy past
and don't come again&mdash;mocking me. I'm going to have a white
night because of you. I'm going to lie awake all night and pity
myself."</p>

<p>Yet already the footsteps of destiny were sound-on the
stairs&mdash;though Emily thought they were only Cousin
Jimmy's.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>He had come to bring her a letter&mdash;a thin letter&mdash;and
if Emily had not been too much absorbed in herself at fourteen she
might have noticed that Cousin Jimmy's eyes were as bright as a
cat's and that an air of ill-concealed excitement pervaded his
whole being. Moreover that, when she had thanked him absently for
the letter and gone back to her desk, he remained in the shadowy
hall outside, watching her slyly through the half-open door. At
first he thought she was not going to open the letter&mdash;she had
flung it down indifferently and sat staring at it. Cousin Jimmy
went nearly mad with impatience.</p>

<p>But after a few minutes more of absent musing Emily roused
herself with a sigh and stretched out a hand for the letter.</p>

<p>"If I don't miss my guess, dear little Emily, you won't sigh
when you read what's in that letter," thought Cousin Jimmy
exultantly.</p>

<p>Emily looked at the return address in the upper corner,
wondering what the Wareham Publishing Company were writing to her
about. The big Warehams! The oldest and most important publishing
house in America. A circular of some kind, probably. Then she found
herself staring incredulously at the typewritten sheet&mdash;while
Cousin Jimmy performed a noiseless dance on Aunt Elizabeth's
braided rug out in the hall.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;don't&mdash;understand," gasped Emily.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>DEAR MISS STARR:&mdash;</p>

<p>We take pleasure in advising you that our readers report
favourably with regard to your story <i>The Moral of the Rose</i>
and if mutually satisfactory arrangements can be made we shall be
glad to add the book to our next season's lists. We shall also be
interested in hearing of your plans with regard to future
writing.</p>

<p>Very sincerely yours, etc.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>"I don't understand&mdash;" said Emily again.</p>

<p>Cousin Jimmy could hold himself in no longer. He made a sound
between a whoop and hurrah. Emily flew across the room and dragged
him in.</p>

<p>"Cousin Jimmy, <i>what</i> does this mean? You must know
something about it&mdash;how did the House of Wareham ever get my
book?"</p>

<p>"Have they really accepted it?" demanded Cousin Jimmy.</p>

<p>"Yes. And <i>I</i> never sent it to them. I wouldn't have
supposed it was the least use&mdash;the <i>Warehams. Am</i> I
dreaming?"</p>

<p>"No. I'll tell you&mdash;don't be mad now, Emily. You mind
Elizabeth asked me to tidy up the garret a month ago. I was moving
that old cardboard box you keep a lot of stuff in and the bottom
fell out. Everything went&mdash;so&mdash;all over the garret. I
gathered 'em up&mdash;and your book manuscript was among 'em. I
happened to look at a page&mdash;and then I set down&mdash;and
Elizabeth came up an hour later and found me still a-sitting there
on my hams reading. I'd forgot everything. My, but she was mad! The
garret not half done and dinner ready. But I didn't mind what she
said&mdash;I was thinking, 'If that book made me forget everything
like that there's <i>something</i> in it. <i>I'll</i> send it
somewhere.' And I didn't know anywhere to send it but to the
Warehams. I'd always heard of them. And I didn't know <i>how</i> to
send it&mdash;but I just stuffed it in an old cracker box and
mailed it to them offhand."</p>

<p>"Didn't you even send stamps for its return?" gasped Emily,
horrified.</p>

<p>"No, never thought of it. Maybe that's why they took it. Maybe
the other firms sent it back because you sent stamps."</p>

<p>"Hardly." Emily laughed and found herself crying.</p>

<p>"Emily, you ain't mad at me, are you?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;no&mdash;darling&mdash;I'm only so flabbergasted, as
you say yourself, that I don't know what to say or do. It's all
so&mdash;the <i>Warehams!"</i></p>

<p>"I've been watching the mails ever since," chuckled Cousin
Jimmy. "Elizabeth has been thinking I've gone clear daft at last.
If the story had come back I was going to smuggle it back to the
garret&mdash;I wasn't going to let you know. But when I saw that
thin envelope&mdash;I remembered you said once the thin envelopes
always had good news&mdash;dear little Emily, don't cry!"</p>

<p>"I can't&mdash;help it&mdash;and oh, I'm sorry for what I called
you, little Fourteen. You weren't silly&mdash;you were
wise&mdash;you knew."</p>

<p>"It's gone to her head a little," said Cousin Jimmy to himself.
"No wonder&mdash;after so many set-backs. But she'll soon be quite
sensible again."</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>Teddy and Ilse were coming home for a brief ten days in July.
How was it, wondered Emily, that they always came together? That
couldn't be just a coincidence. She dreaded the visit and wished it
were over. It would be good to see Ilse again&mdash;somehow she
could never feel a stranger with Ilse. No matter how long she was
away, the moment she came back you found the old Ilse. But she did
not want to see Teddy. Teddy who had forgotten her. Who had never
written since he went away last. Teddy who was already famous, as a
painter of lovely women. So famous and so successful
that&mdash;Ilse wrote&mdash;he was going to give up magazine work.
Emily felt a certain relief when she read that. She would no longer
dread to open a magazine lest she see her own face&mdash;or
soul&mdash;looking at her out of some illustration&mdash;with
"Frederick Kent" scrawled in the corner, as if to say "know all men
by these presents that this girl is mine." Emily resented less the
pictures which looked like her whole face than the ones in which
only the eyes were hers. To be able to paint her eyes like that
Teddy <i>must</i> know everything that was in her soul. The thought
always filled her with fury and shame&mdash;and a sense of horrible
helplessness. She would not&mdash;could not&mdash;tell Teddy to
stop using her as a model. She had never stooped to acknowledge to
him that she had noticed any resemblance to herself in his
illustrations&mdash;she never <i>would</i> stoop.</p>

<p>And now he was coming home&mdash;might be home any time. If only
she could go away&mdash;on any pretence&mdash;for a few weeks. Miss
Royal was wanting her to go to New York for a visit. But it would
never do to go away when Ilse was coming.</p>

<p>Well&mdash;Emily shook herself. What an idiot she was! Teddy was
coming home, a dutiful son, to see his mother&mdash;and he would
doubtless be glad enough to see old friends when their actual
presence recalled them to his memory; and why should there be
anything difficult about it? She must get rid of this absurd
self-consciousness. She would.</p>

<p>She was sitting at her open window. The night outside was like a
dark, heavy, perfumed flower. An expectant night&mdash;a night when
things intended to happen. Very still. Only the loveliest of muted
sounds&mdash;the faintest whisper of trees, the airiest sigh of
wind, the half-heard, half-felt moan of the sea.</p>

<p>"Oh, beauty!" whispered Emily, passionately, lifting her hands
to the stars. "What would I have done without you all these
years?"</p>

<p>Beauty of night&mdash;and perfume&mdash;and mystery. Her soul
was filled with it. There was, just then, room for nothing else.
She bent out, lifting her face to the jewelled sky&mdash;rapt,
ecstatic.</p>

<p>Then she heard it. A soft, silvery signal in Lofty John's
bush&mdash;two higher notes and one long, low one&mdash;the old,
old call that would once have sent her with flying feet to the
shadows of the firs.</p>

<p>Emily sat as if turned to stone, her white face framed in the
vines that clustered round her window. He was there&mdash;Teddy was
there&mdash;in Lofty John's bush&mdash;waiting for
her&mdash;calling to her as of old. Expecting her!</p>

<p>Almost she had sprung to her feet&mdash;almost she had run
downstairs and out to the shadows&mdash;the beautiful, perfumed
shadows where he was waiting for her. But&mdash;</p>

<p>Was he only trying to see if he still had the old power over
her?</p>

<p>He had gone away two years ago without even a written word of
farewell. Would the Murray pride condone that? Would the Murray
pride run to meet the man who had held her of so little account?
The Murray pride would not. Emily's young face took on lines of
stubborn determination in the dim light. She would not go. Let him
call as he might. "Whistle and I'll come to you, my lad," indeed!
No more of that for Emily Byrd Starr. Teddy Kent need not imagine
that he could come and go as went the years and find her meekly
waiting to answer his lordly signal.</p>

<p>Again the call came&mdash;twice. He was there&mdash;so close to
her. In a moment if she liked, she could be beside him&mdash;her
hands in his&mdash;his eyes looking into
hers&mdash;perhaps&mdash;</p>

<p>He had gone away without saying good-bye to her!</p>

<p>Emily rose deliberately and lighted her lamp. She sat down at
her desk near the window, took up her pen and fell to
writing&mdash;or a semblance of writing. Steadily she
wrote&mdash;next day she found sheets covered with aimless
repetitions of old poems learned in school-days&mdash;and as she
wrote she listened. Would the call come again? Once more? It did
not. When she was quite sure it was not coming again she put out
her light and lay down on her bed with her face in the pillow.
Pride was quite satisfied. She had shown him she was not to be
whistled off and on. Oh, how thankful she felt that she had been
firm enough not to go. For which reason, no doubt, her pillow was
wet with savage tears.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>He came next night&mdash;with Ilse&mdash;in his new car. And
there was handshaking and gaiety and laughter&mdash;oh, a great
deal of laughter. Ilse was looking radiant in a big yellow hat
trimmed with crimson roses. One of those preposterous hats only
Ilse could get away with. How unlike the neglected, almost ragged
Ilse of olden days. Yet just as lovable as ever. Nobody could help
loving Ilse. Teddy was charming, too&mdash;with just the right
amount of mingled interest and detachment an old resident coming
back to childhood's home would naturally feel. Interested in
everything and everybody. Oh, yes, indeed, hugely! Ilse tells me
you're bringing out a book. Capital. What's it about? Must get a
copy. Blair Water quite unchanged. Delightful to come back to a
place where time seems to stand still.</p>

<p>Emily almost thought she must have dreamed the whistle in Lofty
John's bush.</p>

<p>But she went for a drive to Priest Pond with him and
Ilse&mdash;and made quite a sensation, for cars were still great
novelties thereabouts. And they had a merry, delightful
time&mdash;then and for the few remaining days of their visit. Ilse
had meant to stay three weeks but found she could stay only five
days. And Teddy, who seemed to be master of his own time, decided
to stay no longer, too. And they both came over to say good-bye to
Emily and all went for a farewell moonlit spin&mdash;and laughed a
great deal&mdash;and Ilse, with a hug, declared it was just like
old times and Teddy agreed.</p>

<p>"If only Perry had been round," he amended. "I'm sorry not to
have seen old Perry. They tell me he is getting on like a house
afire."</p>

<p>Perry had gone to the Coast on business for his firm. Emily
bragged a little about him and his success. Teddy Kent need not
suppose he was the only one who was arriving.</p>

<p>"Are his manners any better than they used to be?" asked
Ilse.</p>

<p>"His manners are good enough for us simple Prince Edward
Islanders," said Emily, nastily.</p>

<p>"Oh, well, I admit I never saw him pick his teeth in public,"
conceded Ilse. "Do you know"&mdash;with a sly, sidelong glance at
Teddy which Emily instantly noticed&mdash;"once I fancied myself
quite in love with Perry Miller."</p>

<p>"Lucky Perry!" said Teddy with what seemed a quiet smile of
satisfied understanding.</p>

<p>Ilse did not kiss Emily good-bye, but she shook hands very
cordially as did Teddy. Emily was thanking her stars, in genuine
earnest this time, that she had not gone to Teddy when he
whistled&mdash;if he ever had whistled. They drove gaily off down
the lane. But when a few moments later Emily turned into New Moon
there were flying footsteps behind her and she was enveloped in a
silken embrace.</p>

<p>"Emily darling, good-bye. I love you as much as ever&mdash;but
everything is so horribly changed&mdash;and we can never find the
Islands of Enchantment again. I wish I hadn't come home at
all&mdash;but say you love me and always will. I couldn't bear it
if you didn't."</p>

<p>"Of course I'll always love you, Ilse."</p>

<p>They kissed lingeringly&mdash;almost sadly&mdash;among the
faint, cold, sweet perfumes of night. Ilse went down the lane to
where Teddy was purring and scintillating for her&mdash;or his car
was&mdash;and Emily went into New Moon where her two old aunts and
Cousin Jimmy were waiting for her.</p>

<p>"I wonder if Ilse and Teddy will ever be married," said Aunt
Laura.</p>

<p>"It's time Ilse was settling down," said Aunt Elizabeth.</p>

<p>"Poor Ilse," said Cousin Jimmy inexplainably.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>One late, lovely autumn day in November Emily walked home from
the Blair Water post-office with a letter from Ilse and a parcel.
She was athrill with an intoxication of excitement that easily
passed for happiness. The whole day had been a strangely,
unreasonably delightful one of ripe sunshine on the sere hills,
faint, grape-like bloom on the faraway woods and a soft, blue sky
with little wisps of grey cloud like cast-off veils. Emily had
wakened in the morning from a dream of Teddy&mdash;the dear,
friendly Teddy of the old days&mdash;and all day she had been
haunted by an odd sense of his nearness. It seemed as if his
footstep sounded at her side and as if she might come upon him
suddenly when she rounded a spruce-fringed curve in the red road or
went down into some sunny hollow where the ferns were thick and
golden&mdash;find him smiling at her with no shadow of change
between them, the years of exile and alienation forgotten. She had
not really thought much about him for a long while. The summer and
autumn had been busy&mdash;she was hard at work on a new
story&mdash;Ilse's letters had been few and scrappy. Why this
sudden, irrational sense of his nearness? When she got Ilse's fat
letter she was quite sure there was some news of Teddy in it.</p>

<p>But it was the little parcel that was responsible for her
excitement. It was stamped with the sign manual of the House of
Wareham and Emily knew what it must hold. Her book&mdash;her
<i>Moral of the Rose.</i></p>

<p>She hurried home by the cross-lots road&mdash;the little old
road over which the vagabond wandered and the lover went to his
lady and children to joy and tired men home&mdash;the road that
linked up eventually with the pasture field by the Blair Water and
the Yesterday Road. Once in the grey-boughed solitude of the
Yesterday Road Emily sat down in a bay of brown bracken and opened
her parcel.</p>

<p>There lay her book. <i>Her</i> book, spleet-new from the
publishers. It was a proud, wonderful, thrilling moment. The crest
of the Alpine Path at last? Emily lifted her shining eyes to the
deep blue November sky and saw peak after peak of sunlit azure
still towering beyond. Always new heights of aspiration. One could
never reach the top really. But what a moment when one reached a
plateau and outlook like this! What a reward for the long years of
toil and endeavour and disappointment and discouragement.</p>

<p>But oh, for her unborn <i>Seller of Dreams!</i></p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>The excitement at New Moon that afternoon almost equalled
Emily's own. Cousin Jimmy gave up unblushingly his plan of
finishing the ploughing of the hill field to sit at home and gloat
over the book. Aunt Laura cried&mdash;of course&mdash;and Aunt
Elizabeth looked indifferent, merely remarking in a tone of
surprise that it was bound like a real book. Evidently Aunt
Elizabeth had been expecting paper covers. But she made some rather
foolish mistakes in her quilt patches that afternoon and she did
not once ask Jimmy why he wasn't ploughing. And when some callers
dropped in later on <i>The Moral of the Rose</i> was mysteriously
on the parlour table, though it had been up on Emily's desk when
Aunt Elizabeth saw the automobile drive into the yard. Aunt
Elizabeth never mentioned it and neither of the callers noticed it.
When they went away Aunt Elizabeth said witheringly that John Angus
had less sense than ever he had and that for her part, if
<i>she</i> were Cousin Margaret, she would <i>not</i> wear clothes
twenty years too young for her.</p>

<p>"An old ewe tricked out like a lamb," said Aunt Elizabeth
contemptuously.</p>

<p>If they had done what was expected of them in regard to <i>The
Moral of the Rose</i> Aunt Elizabeth would probably have said that
John Angus had always been a jovial, good-natured sort of creature
and that it was really wonderful how Cousin Margaret had held her
own.</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p>In all the excitement Emily had&mdash;not exactly forgotten
Ilse's letter, but wanted to wait until things had settled down a
little before reading it. At twilight she went to her room and sat
down in the fading light. The wind had changed at sunset and the
evening was cold and edged. What Jimmy called a "skiff" of snow had
fallen suddenly whitening the world and the withered, unlovely
garden. But the storm-cloud had passed and the sky was clear and
yellow over the white hills and dark firs. The odd perfume that
Ilse always affected floated out of her letter when it was opened.
Emily had always vaguely disliked it. But then her taste differed
from Ilse's in the matter of perfumes as in so many others. Ilse
liked the exotic, oriental, provocative odors. To the day of her
death Emily will never catch a whiff of that perfume without
turning cold and sick.</p>

<p>"Exactly one thousand times have I planned to write to you,"
wrote Ilse, "but when one is revolving rapidly on the wheel of
things there doesn't seem to be an opportunity for anything one
really wants to do. All these months I've been so rushed that I've
felt precisely like a cat just one jump ahead of a dog. If I
stopped for a breath it would catch me.</p>

<p>"But the spirit moves me to utter a few yowls to-night. I've
something to tell you. And your darling letter came to-day&mdash;so
I will write to-night, and let the dog eat me if he will.</p>

<p>"I'm glad you're keeping well and good-humoured. There are times
I envy you fiercely, Emily&mdash;your New Moon quiet and peace and
leisure&mdash;your intense absorption and satisfaction in your
work&mdash;your singleness of purpose. 'If thine eye be single thy
whole body shall be full of light.' That's either in the Bible or
Shakespeare, but wherever it is, it is true. I remember you told me
once you envied me my opportunities of travel. Emily, old dear,
rushing about from one place to another isn't travelling. If you
were like your foolish Ilse, chasing a score of butterfly projects
and ambitions you wouldn't be so happy. You always remind
me&mdash;always did remind me, even in our old chummy days&mdash;of
somebody's line&mdash;'her soul was like a star and dwelt
apart.'</p>

<p>"Well, when one can't get the thing one really wants, one can't
help chasing after anything that <i>might</i> made a decent
substitute. I know you've always thought me an unmitigated donkey
because I cared so much about Perry Miller. I knew you never quite
understood. You couldn't. You never really cared a hoot about any
he-creature, did you, Emily? So you thought me an idiot. I daresay
I was. But I'm going to be sensible in future, I'm going to marry
Teddy Kent."</p>

<h3>VI</h3>

<p>"There&mdash;it's out!"</p>

<p>Emily laid down&mdash;or dropped&mdash;the letter for a moment.
She did not feel either pain or surprise&mdash;one does not feel
either, I am told, when a bullet strikes the heart. It seemed to
her that she had always known this was coming&mdash;always. At
least, since the night of Mrs. Chidlaw's dinner-dance. And yet, now
that it had really happened, it seemed to her that she was
suffering everything of death but its merciful dying. In the dim,
twilit mirror before her she saw her own face. Had
Emily-in-the-glass ever looked like that before? But her room was
just the same. It seemed indecent that it should be the same. After
a few moments&mdash;or years&mdash;Emily picked up the letter and
read on.</p>

<p>"I'm not in love with Teddy, of course. But he's just got to be
a habit with me. I can't do without him&mdash;and I either have to
do without him or marry him. He won't stand my hesitation any
longer. Besides, he's going to be very famous. I shall enjoy being
the wife of a famous man. Also, he will have the simoleons, too.
Not that I'm altogether mercenary, Emily. I said 'No' to a
millionaire last week. A nice fellow, too&mdash;but with a face
like a good-natured weasel's, if there can be such a thing. And he
<i>cried</i> when I told him I wouldn't marry him. Oh, it was
ghastly.</p>

<p>"Yes, it's mostly ambition, I grant you. And a certain odd kind
of weariness and impatience with my life as it has been these last
few years. Everything seems squeezed dry. But I'm really very fond
of Teddy&mdash;always was. He's nice and companionable&mdash;and
our taste in jokes is exactly the same. And he never bores me. I
have no use for people who bore me. Of course he's too good-looking
for a man&mdash;he'll always be a target for the head-hunters. But
since I don't care <i>too</i> much for him I shan't be tortured by
jealousy. In life's morning march when my bosom was young I could
have fried in boiling oil anyone&mdash;except you&mdash;at whom
Perry Miller cast a sheep's eye.</p>

<p>"I've thought for years and known for weeks that this was coming
some day. But I've been staving Teddy off&mdash;I wouldn't let him
say the words that would really bind us. I don't know whether I'd
ever have scraped up the courage to let him say them, but destiny
took a hand. We were out for a spin two weeks ago one evening and a
most unseasonable and malignant thunder-storm came up. We had a
dreadful time getting back&mdash;there was no place on that bare,
lonely hill-road we could stop&mdash;the rain fell in torrents, the
thunder crashed, the lightning flashed. It was unendurable and we
didn't endure it. We just tore through it and cussed. Then it
cleared off as suddenly as it had began&mdash;and my nerves went to
pieces&mdash;fancy! I <i>have</i> nerves now&mdash;and I began to
cry like a frightened, foolish baby. And Teddy's arms were about me
and he was saying I <i>must</i> marry him&mdash;and let him take
care of me. I suppose I said I would because it's quite clear he
thinks we are engaged. He has given me a blue Chow pup and a
sapphire ring&mdash;a sapphire he picked up in Europe
somewhere&mdash;an historic jewel for which a murder was once
committed, I believe.</p>

<p>"I think it will be rather nice to be taken care of. Properly. I
never was, you know. Dad had no use for me until you found out the
truth about Mother&mdash;what a witch you were! And after that he
adored and spoiled me. But he didn't take any more real care of me
than before.</p>

<p>"We are to be married next June. Dad will be pleased, I fancy.
Teddy was always the white-haired boy with him. Besides, I think he
was beginning to be a little scared I was never going to hook a
husband. Dad plumes himself on being a radical but at heart he
out-Victorians the Victorians.</p>

<p>"And of course you must be my bridesmaid. Oh, Emily dear, how I
wish I could see you to-night&mdash;talk with you&mdash;one of our
old-time spiels&mdash;walk with you over the Delectable Mountain
and along the ferny, frosted woodside, hang about that old garden
by the sea where red poppies blow&mdash;all our old familiar
places. I wish&mdash;I think I really do wish&mdash;I was ragged,
barefooted, wild Ilse Burnley again. Life is pleasant
still&mdash;oh, I don't say it isn't. Very pleasant&mdash;in
spots&mdash;like the curate's immortal egg. But the 'first fine
careless rapture'&mdash;the thrush may recapture it but we never.
Emily, old pal, would you turn the clock back if you could?"</p>

<h3>VII</h3>

<p>Emily read the letter over three times. Then she sat for a very
long time at her window, looking blindly out on the blanched, dim
world lying under the terrible mockery of a sky full of stars. The
wind around the eaves was full of ghostly voices. Bits here and
there in Ilse's letter turned and twisted and vanished in her
consciousness like little venomous snakes, each with a mortal
sting.</p>

<p>"Your singleness of purpose"&mdash;"you never cared for
anyone"&mdash;"of course you must be my bridesmaid"&mdash;"I'm
really very fond of Teddy"&mdash;"my hesitation."</p>

<p><i>Could</i> any girl really "hesitate" over accepting Teddy
Kent? Emily heard a little note of bitter laughter. Was it
something in herself that laughed&mdash;or that vanishing spectre
of Teddy that had haunted her all day&mdash;or an old smothered
persistent hope that laughed before it died at last?</p>

<p>And at that very moment probably Ilse and Teddy were
together.</p>

<p>"If I had gone&mdash;that night&mdash;last summer&mdash;when he
called&mdash;would it have made any difference?" was the question
that asked itself over and over again maddeningly.</p>

<p>"I wish I could hate Ilse. It would make it easier," she thought
drearily. "If she loved Teddy I think I <i>could</i> hate her.
Somehow, it isn't so dreadful when she doesn't. It ought to be
<i>more</i> dreadful. It's very strange that I can bear the thought
of his loving her when I couldn't bear the thought of her loving
him."</p>

<p>A great weariness suddenly possessed her. For the first time in
her life death seemed a friend. It was very late when she finally
went to bed. Towards morning she slept a little. But wakened
stupidly at dawn. What was it she had heard?</p>

<p>She remembered.</p>

<p>She got up and dressed&mdash;as she must get up and dress every
morning to come for endless years.</p>

<p>"Well," she said aloud to Emily-in-the-glass. "I've spilled my
cup of life's wine on the ground&mdash;somehow. And she will give
me no more. So I must go thirsty. Would&mdash;<i>would</i> it have
been different if I had gone to him that night he called. If I only
knew!" She thought she could see Dean's ironical, compassionate
eyes.</p>

<p>Suddenly she laughed.</p>

<p>"In plain English&mdash;as Ilse would say&mdash;what a devilish
mess I've made of things!"</p>

<hr><h2><a name="C22" id="C22"><i>Chapter XXII</i></a>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>Life, of course, went on in spite of its dreadfulness. The
routine of existence doesn't stop because one is miserable. There
were even some moments that were not altogether bad. Emily again
measured her strength with pain and again conquered. With the
Murray pride and the Starr reserve at her elbow she wrote Ilse a
letter of good wishes with which nobody could have found fault. If
that were only all she had to do! If only people wouldn't keep on
talking to her about Ilse and Teddy.</p>

<p>The engagement was announced in the Montreal papers and then in
the Island ones.</p>

<p>"Yes, they're engaged and heaven help every one concerned," said
Dr. Burnley. But he could not hide his satisfaction in it.</p>

<p>"Thought at one time <i>you</i> and Teddy were going to make a
match of it," he said jovially to Emily&mdash;who smiled gallantly
and said something about the unexpected always happening.</p>

<p>"Anyhow we'll have a wedding that <i>is</i> a wedding," declared
the doctor. "We haven't had a wedding in the clan for God knows how
long. I thought they'd forgotten how. I'll show 'em. Ilse writes me
you're to be bridesmaid. And I'll be wanting you to oversee things
generally. Can't trust a wedding to a housekeeper."</p>

<p>"Anything I can do, of course," said Emily automatically. Nobody
should suspect what she felt not if she died for it. She would even
be bridesmaid.</p>

<p>If it had not been for that prospect ahead she thought she could
have got through the winter not unhappily. For <i>The Moral of the
Rose</i> was a success from the start. The first edition exhausted
in ten days&mdash;three large editions in two weeks&mdash;five in
eight weeks. Exaggerated reports of the pecuniary returns were
circulated everywhere. For the first time Uncle Wallace looked at
her with respect and Aunt Addie wished secretly that Andrew hadn't
been consoled quite so soon. Old Cousin Charlotte, of Derry Pond,
heard of the many editions and opined that Emily must be very busy
if she had to put all the books together and sew them herself. The
Shrewsbury people were furious because they imagined they were in
the book. Every family believed <i>they</i> were the
Applegaths.</p>

<p>"You were right not to come to New York," wrote Miss Royal. "You
could never have written <i>The Moral of the Rose</i> here. Wild
roses won't grow in city streets. And your story is like a wild
rose, dear, all sweetness and unexpectedness with sly little thorns
of wit and satire. It has power, delicacy, understanding. It's not
just story-telling. There's some magicry in it. Emily Byrd Starr,
where do you get your uncanny understanding of human
nature&mdash;you infant?"</p>

<p>Dean wrote too&mdash;"good creative work, Emily. Your characters
are natural and human and delightful. And I like the glowing spirit
of youth that pervades the book."</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>"I had hoped to learn something from the reviews, but they are
all too contradictory," said Emily. "What one reviewer pronounces
the book's greatest merit another condemns as its worst fault.
Listen to these&mdash;'Miss Starr never succeeds in making her
characters convincing' and 'One fancies that some of the author's
characters must have been copied from real life. They are so
absolutely true to nature that they could hardly be the work of
imagination.'"</p>

<p>"I told you people would recognize old Douglas Courcy,"
interjected Aunt Elizabeth.</p>

<p>"'A very tiresome book'&mdash;'a very delightful
book'&mdash;'very undistinguished fiction' and 'on every page the
work of the finished artist is apparent'&mdash;'a book of cheap and
weak romanticism' and 'a classic quality in the book'&mdash;'a
unique story of a rare order of literary workmanship' and 'a silly,
worthless, colourless and desultory story'&mdash;'an ephemeral sort
of affair' and a book destined to live.' What <i>is</i> one to
believe?"</p>

<p>"I would just believe only the favourable ones," said Aunt
Laura.</p>

<p>Emily sighed.</p>

<p>"My tendency is just the other way. I can't help believing the
unfavourable ones are true and that the favourable ones were
written by morons. But I don't really mind much what they say about
the <i>book.</i> It's only when they criticize my heroine that I'm
hurt and furious, I saw red over these reviews of darling
<i>Peggy.</i> 'A girl of extraordinary stupidity'&mdash;'the
heroine has too marked a self-consciousness of her mission.'"</p>

<p>"I <i>did</i> think she was a bit of a flirt," conceded Cousin
Jimmy.</p>

<p>"'A thin, sweetish heroine'&mdash;'the heroine is something of a
bore'&mdash;'queer but altogether too queer.'"</p>

<p>"I told you she shouldn't have had green eyes," groaned Cousin
Jimmy. "A heroine should always have blue eyes.'</p>

<p>"Oh, but listen to this," cried Emily gaily&mdash;"'<i>Peg
Applegath</i> is simply irresistible'&mdash;'<i>Peg</i> is a
remarkably vivid personality'&mdash;'a fascinating
heroine'&mdash;'<i>Peg</i> is too delightful not to be credited
while we are under her spell'&mdash;'one of the immortal girls of
literature.' What about green eyes now, Cousin Jimmy?"</p>

<p>Cousin Jimmy shook his head. He was not convinced.</p>

<p>"Here's a review for you," twinkled Emily. "'A psychological
problem with roots that stretch far into subliminal depths which
would give the book weight and value if it were grappled with
sincerely.'"</p>

<p>"I know the meaning of all those words by themselves except two,
but put together they don't make any sense," protested Cousin Jimmy
ruefully.</p>

<p>"'Beneath the elusiveness and atmospheric charm is a wonderful
firmness of character delineation.'"</p>

<p>"I don't quite get that either," confessed Cousin Jimmy, "But it
sounds kind of favourable."</p>

<p>"'A conventional and commonplace book.'"</p>

<p>"What does 'conventional' mean!" asked Aunt Elizabeth, who would
not have been posed by transubstantiation or Gnosticism.</p>

<p>"'Beautifully written and full of sparkling humour. Miss Starr
is a real artist in literature.'"</p>

<p>"Oh, now, <i>there's</i> a reviewer with some sense," purred
Cousin Jimmy.</p>

<p>"'The general impression left by the book is that it might be
much worse.'"</p>

<p><i>"That</i> reviewer was trying to be smart, I suppose," said
Aunt Elizabeth, apparently quite oblivious of the fact that she had
said the very same thing herself.</p>

<p>"'This book lacks spontaneity. It is saccharine and
melodramatic, mawkish and naive.'"</p>

<p>"I know I fell into the well," said Cousin Jimmy pitifully. "Is
that why I can't make head or tail out of that?"</p>

<p>"Here's one you can understand&mdash;perhaps. 'Miss Starr must
have invented the <i>Applegath</i> orchard as well as her
green-eyed heroine. There are no orchards in Prince Edward Island.
They are killed by the harsh, salt winds that blow across that
narrow sandy strip.'"</p>

<p>"Read that again please, Emily."</p>

<p>Emily complied. Cousin Jimmy scratched his head, then shook it.
"Do they let that kind run loose over there?"</p>

<p>"'The story is a charming one, charmingly told. The characters
are skilfully depicted, the dialogue deftly handled, the
descriptive passages surprisingly effective. The quiet humour is
simply delightful.'"</p>

<p>"I hope this will not make you vain, Emily," said Aunt Elizabeth
warningly.</p>

<p>"If it does, here's the antidote. 'This feeble, pretentious and
sentimental story&mdash;if story it can be called&mdash;is full of
banalities and trivialities. A mass of disconnected episodes and
scraps of conversation, intermingled with long periods of
reflection and self-examination.'"</p>

<p>"I wonder if the creature who wrote that knew the meaning of the
words himself," said Aunt Laura.</p>

<p>"'The scene of this story is laid in Prince Edward Island, a
detached portion of land off the coast of Newfoundland.'"</p>

<p>"Don't Yankees <i>ever</i> study geography?" snorted exasperated
Cousin Jimmy.</p>

<p>"'A story that will not corrupt its readers.'"</p>

<p>"<i>There's</i> a real compliment now," said Aunt Elizabeth.</p>

<p>Cousin Jimmy looked doubtful. It sounded all right but&mdash;of
course dear little Emily's book couldn't corrupt anyone
but&mdash;</p>

<p>"'To review a book of this kind is like attempting to dissect a
butterfly's wing or strip a rose of its petals to discover the
secret of its fragrance.'"</p>

<p>"Too highfalutin," sniffed Aunt Elizabeth.</p>

<p>"'Honeyed sentimentality which the author evidently supposes is
poetic fancy.'"</p>

<p>"Wouldn't I like to smack his gob," said Cousin Jimmy
feelingly.</p>

<p>"'Harmless and easy reading.'"</p>

<p>"I don't know why, but I don't quite like the sound of that,"
commented Aunt Laura.</p>

<p>"'This story will keep a kindly smile upon your lips and in your
heart as well.'"</p>

<p>"Come now, that's English. I can understand <i>that,"</i> beamed
Cousin Jimmy.</p>

<p>"'We began but found it impossible to finish this crude and
tiresome book.'"</p>

<p>"Well, all <i>I</i> can say," said Cousin Jimmy indignantly, "is
that the oftener I read <i>The Moral of the Rose</i> the better I
like it. Why, I was reading it for the fourth time yesterday and I
was so interested I clean forgot all about dinner."</p>

<p>Emily smiled. It was better to have won her standing with the
New Moon folks than with the world. What mattered it what any
reviewer said when Aunt Elizabeth remarked with an air of uttering
the final judgment:</p>

<p>"Well, I never could have believed that a pack of lies could
sound as much like the real truth as that book does."</p>

<hr><h2><a name="C23" id="C23"><i>Chapter XXIII</i></a>
</h2>

<p><i>&nbsp;</i>
</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>Emily, coming home one January night from an evening call,
decided to use the cross-lots road that skirted the Tansy Patch. It
had been a winter almost without snow and the ground under her feet
was bare and hard. She seemed the only living creature abroad in
the night and she walked slowly, savouring the fine, grim, eerie
charm of flowerless meadows and silent woods, of the moon breaking
suddenly out of black clouds over the lowlands of pointed firs; and
trying, more or less successfully, not to think of the letter that
had come from Ilse that day&mdash;one of Ilse's gay, incoherent
letters, where one fact stood out barely. The wedding-day was
set&mdash;the fifteenth of June.</p>

<p>"I want you to wear harebell blue gauze over ivory taffeta for
your bridesmaid dress, darling. How your black silk hair will shine
over it!</p>

<p>"My 'bridal robe' is going to be of ivory velvet and old
Great-aunt Edith in Scotland is sending me out her veil of
rose-point and Great-aunt Theresa in the same historic land is
sending me a train of silver oriental embroidery that her husband
once brought home from Constantinople. I'll veil it with tulle.
Won't I be a dazzling creature? I don't think the dear old souls
knew I existed till Dad wrote them about my 'forthcoming nuptials.'
Dad is far more excited over everything than I am.</p>

<p>"Teddy and I are going to spend our honeymoon in old inns in
out-of-the-way European corners&mdash;places where nobody else
wants to go&mdash;Vallambroso and so on. That line of Milton's
always intrigued me&mdash;'thick as autumnal leaves that strew the
brooks in Vallambroso.' When you take it away from its horrible
context it is a picture of sheer delight.</p>

<p>"I'll be home in May for my last preparations and Teddy will
come the first of June to spend a little while with his mother. How
<i>is</i> she taking it, Emily? Have you any idea? I can't get
anything out of Teddy, so I suppose she doesn't like it. She always
hated me, I know. But then she seemed to hate everyone&mdash;with a
special venom for you. I won't be particularly fortunate in my
mother-in-law. I'll always have an eerie feeling that she's
secretly heaping maledictions on my head. However, Teddy is nice
enough to make up for her. He really is. I'd no idea how nice he
could be and I'm growing fonder of him every day. Honestly. When I
look at him and realize how handsome and charming he is I can't
understand why I'm not madly in love with him. But it's really much
more comfortable not to be. If I were I'd be heartbroken every time
we quarrelled. We're always quarrelling&mdash;you know me of old.
We always will. We'll spoil every wonderful moment with a quarrel.
But life won't be dull."</p>

<p>Emily shivered. Her own life was looking very bleak and starved
just then. Oh, how&mdash;nice&mdash;it would be when the wedding
was over&mdash;the wedding where <i>she</i> should be
bride&mdash;yes, <i>should</i>&mdash;and was to be
bridesmaid&mdash;and people done talking of it. "Harebell blue over
ivory taffeta!" Sackcloth and ashes, rather.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>"Emily. Emily Starr."</p>

<p>Emily almost jumped. She had not seen Mrs. Kent in the gloom
until they were face to face&mdash;at the little side path that led
up to the Tansy Patch. She was standing there, bareheaded in the
chill night, with outstretched hand.</p>

<p>"Emily, I want to have a talk with you. I saw you go past here
at sunset and I've been watching for you ever since. Come up to the
house."</p>

<p>Emily would much rather have refused. Yet she turned and
silently climbed the steep, root-ribbed path, with Mrs. Kent
flitting before her like a little dead leaf borne along by the
wind. Through the ragged old garden where nothing ever grew but
tansy, and into the little house that was as shabby as it had
always been. People said Teddy Kent might fix up his mother's house
a bit if he were making all the money folks said he was. But Emily
knew that Mrs. Kent would not let him&mdash;would not have anything
changed.</p>

<p>She looked around the little place curiously. She had not been
in it for many years&mdash;not since the long-ago days when she and
Ilse and Teddy had been children there. It seemed quite unchanged.
As of yore, the house seemed to be afraid of laughter. Someone
always seemed to be praying in it. It had an atmosphere of prayer.
And the old willow to the west was still tap-tapping on the window
with ghostly finger-tips. On the mantel was a recent photograph of
Teddy&mdash;a good one. He seemed on the point of speaking&mdash;of
saying something triumphant&mdash;exultant.</p>

<p>"Emily, I've found the rainbow gold. Fame&mdash;and love."</p>

<p>She turned her back on it and sat down. Mrs. Kent sat
opposite&mdash;a faded, shrinking little figure with the long scar
slanting palely across her bitter mouth and lined face&mdash;the
face that must have been very pretty once. She was looking
intently, searchingly at Emily; but, as Emily instantly realized,
the old smouldering hatred had gone out of her eyes&mdash;her tired
eyes that must once have been young and eager and laughter-lit. She
leaned forward and touched Emily's arm with her slim, claw-like
fingers.</p>

<p>"You know that Teddy is going to marry Ilse Burnley," she
said.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"What do you feel about it?"</p>

<p>Emily moved impatiently.</p>

<p>"What do my feelings matter, Mrs. Kent? Teddy loves Ilse. She is
a beautiful, brilliant, warmhearted girl. I am sure they will be
very happy."</p>

<p>"Do <i>you</i> still love him?"</p>

<p>Emily wondered why she did not feel resentment. But Mrs. Kent
was not to be judged by ordinary rules. And here was a fine chance
to save her face by a cool little lie&mdash;just a few indifferent
words. "Not any longer, Mrs. Kent. Oh, I know I once imagined I
did&mdash;imagining things like that is one of my weaknesses
unfortunately. But I find I don't care at all."</p>

<p>Why couldn't she say them? Well, she couldn't, that was all. She
could never, in any words, deny her love for Teddy. It was so much
a part of herself that it had a divine right to truth. And was
there not, too, a secret relief in feeling that here at least was
one person with whom she could be herself&mdash;before whom she
need not pretend or hide?</p>

<p>"I don't think you have any right to ask that question, Mrs.
Kent. But&mdash;I do."</p>

<p>Mrs. Kent laughed silently.</p>

<p>"I used to hate you. I don't hate you any longer. We are one
now, you and I. We love him. And he has forgotten us&mdash;he cares
nothing for us&mdash;he has gone to <i>her."</i></p>

<p>"He does care for you, Mrs. Kent. He always did. Surely you can
understand that there is more than one kind of love. And I
hope&mdash;you are not going to hate Ilse because Teddy loves
her."</p>

<p>"No, I don't hate her. She is more beautiful than you, but there
is no mystery about her. She will never possess him wholly as you
would have. It's quite different. But I want to know this&mdash;are
you unhappy because of this?"</p>

<p>"No. Only for a few minutes now and then. Generally I am too
much interested in my work to brood morbidly on what can't be
mine."</p>

<p>Mrs. Kent had listened thirstily. "Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;exactly.
I thought so. The Murrays are so sensible. Some day&mdash;some
day&mdash;you'll be glad this has happened&mdash;glad that Teddy
didn't care for you. Don't you think you will?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps."</p>

<p>"Oh, I am sure of it. It's so much better for you. Oh, you don't
know the suffering and wretchedness you will be spared. It's
madness to love anything too much. God <i>is</i> jealous. If you
married Teddy he would break your heart&mdash;they always do. It is
best&mdash;you will live to feel it was best."</p>

<p>Tap&mdash;tap&mdash;tap went the old willow.</p>

<p>"Need we talk of this any more, Mrs. Kent?"</p>

<p>"Do you remember that night I found you and Teddy in the
graveyard?" asked Mrs. Kent, apparently deaf to Emily's
question.</p>

<p>"Yes." Emily found herself remembering it very
vividly&mdash;that strange wonderful night when Teddy had saved her
from mad Mr. Morrison and said such sweet, unforgettable things to
her.</p>

<p>"Oh, how I hated you that night!" exclaimed Mrs. Kent. "But I
shouldn't have said those things to you. All my life I've been
saying things I shouldn't. Once I said a terrible thing&mdash;such
a terrible thing. I've never been able to get the echo of it out of
my ears. And do you remember what <i>you</i> said to <i>me?</i>
That was why I let Teddy go away from me. It was <i>your</i> doing.
If he hadn't gone you mightn't have lost him. Are you sorry you
spoke so?"</p>

<p>"No. If anything I said helped to clear the way for him I'm
glad&mdash;glad."</p>

<p>"You would do it over again?"</p>

<p>"I would."</p>

<p>"And don't you hate Ilse bitterly? She has taken what you
wanted. You <i>must</i> hate her."</p>

<p>"I do not. I love Ilse dearly as I always did. She has taken
nothing from me that was ever mine."</p>

<p>"I don't understand it&mdash;I don't understand it," half
whispered Mrs. Kent. <i>"My</i> love isn't like that. Perhaps that
is why it has always made me so unhappy. No, I don't hate you any
longer. But oh, I did hate you. I knew Teddy cared more for you
than he did for me. Didn't you and he talk about me&mdash;criticize
me?"</p>

<p>"Never."</p>

<p>"I thought you did. People were always doing
that&mdash;always."</p>

<p>Suddenly Mrs. Kent struck her tiny hands together violently.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you tell me you didn't love him any longer? Why
didn't you&mdash;even if it was a lie? That was what I wanted to
hear. I could have believed you. The Murrays never lie."</p>

<p>"Oh, what does it matter?" cried tortured Emily again. "My love
means nothing to him now. He is Ilse's. You need not be jealous of
me any longer, Mrs. Kent."</p>

<p>"I'm not&mdash;I'm not&mdash;it isn't that." Mrs. Kent looked at
her oddly. "Oh, if I only dared&mdash;but no&mdash;but no, it's too
late. It would be no use now. I don't think I know what I'm saying.
Only&mdash;Emily&mdash;will you come to see me sometimes? It's
lonely here&mdash;very lonely&mdash;so much worse now when he
belongs to Ilse. His picture came last Wednesday&mdash;no,
Thursday. There is so little to distinguish the days here. I put it
up there, but it makes things worse. He was thinking of her in
it&mdash;can't you tell by his eyes he was thinking of the woman he
loves? I am of no importance to him now. I am of no importance to
anybody."</p>

<p>"If I come to see you&mdash;you mustn't talk of him&mdash;or of
them," said Emily, pitingly.</p>

<p>"I won't. Oh, I won't. Though that won't prevent us from
thinking of them, will it? You'll sit there&mdash;and I'll sit
here&mdash;and we'll talk of the weather and think of <i>him.</i>
How amusing! But&mdash;when you've really forgotten him&mdash;when
you really don't care any more&mdash;you'll tell me, won't
you?"</p>

<p>Emily nodded and rose to go. She could not endure this any
longer. "And if there is ever anything I can do for you, Mrs.
Kent&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I want rest&mdash;rest," said Mrs. Kent, laughing wildly. "Can
you find that for me? Don't you know I'm a ghost, Emily? I died
years ago. I walk in the dark."</p>

<p>As the door closed behind her Emily heard Mrs. Kent beginning to
cry terribly. With a sigh of relief she turned to the crisp open
spaces of the wind and the night, the shadows and the frosty moon.
Ah, one could breathe here.</p>

<hr><h2><a name="C24" id="C24"><i>Chapter XXIV</i></a>
</h2>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>Ilse came in May&mdash;a gay, laughing Ilse. Almost <i>too</i>
gay and laughing, Emily thought. Ilse had always been a merry,
irresponsible creature; but not quite so unceasingly so as now. She
never had a serious mood, apparently. She made a jest of
everything, even her marriage. Aunt Elizabeth and Aunt Laura were
quite shocked at her. A girl who was so soon to assume the
responsibilities of wedded life should be more thoughtful and
sober. Ilse told Emily they were mid-Victorian screams. She chatted
ceaselessly when she and Emily were together, but never
<i>talked</i> to her, despite the desire expressed in her letters
for old-time spiels. Perhaps she was not quite all to blame for
this. Emily, in spite of her determination to be exactly the same
as of yore, could not help a certain restraint and reserve, born of
her secret pain and her fierce determination to hide it. Ilse felt
the restraint, though wholly unsuspicious of the cause. Emily was
just naturally growing a little bit New Moonish, that was all,
living there alone with those dear old antediluvians.</p>

<p>"When Teddy and I come back and set up house in Montreal you
must spend every winter with us, darling. New Moon is a dear place
in summer, but in winter you must be absolutely buried alive."</p>

<p>Emily made no promises. She did not see herself as a guest in
Teddy's home. Every night she told herself she could not possibly
endure tomorrow. But when to-morrow came it was livable. It was
even possible to talk dress and details calmly with Ilse. The
harebell blue dress became a reality and Emily tried it on two
nights before Teddy was expected home. The wedding was only two
weeks away now.</p>

<p>"You look like a dream in it, Emily," said Ilse, stretched out
on Emily's bed with the grace and abandon of a cat&mdash;Teddy's
sapphire blotting her finger darkly. "You'll make all my velvet and
lace gorgeousness look obvious and crude. Did I tell you Teddy is
bringing Lorne Halsey with him for best man? I'm positively
thrilled&mdash;the great Halsey. His mother has been so ill he
didn't think he could come. But the obliging old lady has suddenly
recovered and he's actually coming. His new book is a wow.
Everybody in Montreal was raving over it and he's the most
interesting and improbable creature. Wouldn't it be wonderful if
you and he were to fall in love with each other, Emily?"</p>

<p>"Don't go matchmaking for me, Ilse," said Emily with a faint
smile, as she took off the harebell dress. "I feel in my bones that
I shall achieve old-maidenhood, which is an entirely different
thing from having old-maidenhood thrust upon you."</p>

<p>"To be sure, he looks like a gargoyle," said Ilse meditatively.
"If it hadn't been for that I think I might have married him
myself. I'm almost sure I could have. His way of making love was to
ask me my opinion about things. That was agreeable. But I had a
hunch that if we were married he would stop asking for my opinion.
That would <i>not</i> be agreeable. Besides, nobody could ever tell
what he really thought. He might be looking as though he adored you
and thinking he saw crow's-feet around your eyes. By the way, isn't
Teddy the most beautiful thing?"</p>

<p>"He was always a nice-looking boy."</p>

<p>"'A nice-looking boy,'" mimicked Ilse. "Emily Starr, if you ever
do marry I hope your husband will chain you in the dog-kennel. I'll
be calling you Aunt Emily in a minute. Why, there's nobody in
Montreal who can hold a candle to him. It's his looks I love
really&mdash;not him. Sometimes he bores me&mdash;really. Although
I was so sure he wouldn't. He never did before we were engaged. I
have a premonition that some day I'll throw the teapot at him.
Isn't it a pity we can't have two husbands? One to look at and one
to talk to. But Teddy and I will be by way of being a stunning
couple, won't we, honey? He so dark&mdash;I so fair. Ideal. I've
always wished I was 'a dark ladye'&mdash;like you&mdash;but when I
said so to Teddy he just laughed and quoted the old verse,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>'If the bards of old the truth have told<br>
The sirens have raven hair.<br>
But over the earth since art had birth,<br>
They paint the angels fair.'</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That's the nearest Teddy will ever get to calling <i>me</i> an
angel. Luckily. For when all's said and done, Emily, I'd
rather&mdash;are you sure the door is shut so that Aunt Laura won't
drop dead?&mdash;I'd <i>much</i> rather be a siren than an angel.
Wouldn't you?"</p>

<p>"Let's check up the invitations now and make sure we haven't
left anybody out," was Emily's response to this riot of words.</p>

<p>"Isn't it terrible to belong to a clan like ours?" said Ilse
peevishly. "There's such a ghastly lot of old frumps and bores that
have to be among those present. I hope some day I'll get where
there are no relations. I wish the whole damn affair was over.
You're sure you addressed a bid to Perry, aren't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I wonder if he'll come? I hope he will. What a goose I was ever
to fancy I cared so much for him! I used to hope&mdash;all sorts of
things, in spite of the fact I knew he was crazy about you. But I
never hoped after Mrs. Chidlaw's dinner-dance. Do you remember it,
Emily?"</p>

<p>Yes, Emily remembered <i>that.</i></p>

<p>"Till then I'd always hoped a <i>little</i>&mdash;that some day
when he realized he couldn't have you&mdash;I'd catch his heart on
the rebound&mdash;wasn't that the Victorian phrase? I thought he'd
be at the Chidlaws'&mdash;I knew he had been invited. And I asked
Teddy if Perry were coming. Teddy looked right into my eyes
meaningly and said, 'Perry will not be here. He's working on the
case he has to appear in to-morrow. Perry's goal is ambition. He
has no time for love.'</p>

<p>"I knew he was trying to warn me&mdash;and I knew it was no use
to go on hoping&mdash;anything. So I gave up definitely. Well, it's
turned out all right. Isn't it charming how things do turn out so
beautifully? Makes one quite believe in an overruling Providence.
Isn't it nice to be able to blame everything on God?"</p>

<p>Emily hardly heard Ilse as she mechanically hung up the blue
dress in her closet and slipped into a little green sport suit. So
<i>that</i> was what Teddy had said to Ilse that night years ago
when she knew he had uttered the word "love." And she had been so
chilly to him because of it. Well, not likely it mattered. No doubt
he had only been warning Ilse because he wanted her to turn her
maiden thoughts from Perry and concentrate them on himself. She
felt relieved when Ilse finally went home. Ilse's light, continual
chatter rather got on her nerves&mdash;though she was ashamed to
admit it. But then her nerves were on edge under this
long-drawn-out torture. Two weeks more of it&mdash;and then, thank
God, at least peace.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>She went up to the Tansy Patch in the dusk to take back a book
Mrs. Kent had lent her the night before. The visit must be made
before Teddy came home. She had been up to the Tansy Patch several
times since that first evening and an odd sort of friendship had
sprung up between her and Mrs. Kent. They lent each other books and
talked of everything except the one thing that mattered most to
them. The book Emily was returning was an old copy of <i>The South
African Farm.</i> Emily had expressed a wish to read it and Mrs.
Kent had gone upstairs and presently came down with it&mdash;her
white face a little whiter and the scar burning redly across it as
always when she was deeply moved.</p>

<p>"Here is the book you want," she said. "I had it in a box
upstairs."</p>

<p>Emily finished reading the book before she went to sleep. She
was not sleeping well now and the nights were long. The book had a
musty, unaired odour&mdash;evidently the box Mrs. Kent spoke of had
not been opened for a long time. And in it Emily found a thin
letter, unstamped, addressed to Mrs. David Kent.</p>

<p>The curious thing about the letter was that it was, apparently,
unopened. Well, letters often re-sealed themselves like that, if
placed under pressure, when the flap had pulled open untorn in the
first opening. Not likely it was of much significance. But of
course she would mention it when she took the book back.</p>

<p>"Did you know there was a letter in this book, Mrs. Kent?"</p>

<p>"A letter. Did you say a letter?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Addressed to you."</p>

<p>Emily held the letter out to Mrs. Kent, whose face became
ghastly as she looked at the handwriting.</p>

<p>"You found that&mdash;in that book?" she whispered. "In that
book that hasn't been opened for over twenty-five years? Do you
know&mdash;who wrote this letter? My&mdash;husband wrote
it&mdash;and I have never read it&mdash;never known of it."</p>

<p>Emily felt herself in the presence of some tragedy&mdash;the
secret torture of Mrs. Kent's life, perhaps.</p>

<p>"I will go away&mdash;so that you can read it alone," she said
gently and went out, leaving Mrs. Kent standing in the shadowy
little room, holding the letter in her hand&mdash;as one might hold
a snake.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>"I sent for you to-night because there is something I must tell
you," said Mrs. Kent.</p>

<p>She was sitting, a tiny, erect, determined creature in the
armchair by the window in the harsh light of a cold sunset. It was
June but it was cold. The sky was hard and autumnal. Emily, walking
up the cross-lots path had shivered and wished herself at home. But
Mrs. Kent's note had been urgent&mdash;almost peremptory. Why in
the world did she want her! Surely, it could not be anything in
connection with Teddy. And yet what else could make Mrs. Kent send
for her in this fashion?</p>

<p>The moment she saw Mrs. Kent she was conscious of a curious
change in her&mdash;a change hard to define. She was as frail, as
pitiful as ever. There seemed even a certain defiant light in her
eyes. But for the first time since she had known Mrs. Kent Emily
did not feel that she was in the presence of an unhappy woman.
There was peace here&mdash;a strange, sorrowful, long-unknown
peace. The tortured soul was&mdash;at last&mdash;off the rack.</p>

<p>"I have been dead&mdash;and in hell&mdash;but now I am alive
again," said Mrs. Kent. "It's you who have done this&mdash;you
found that letter. And so there is something I must tell you. It
will make you hate me. And I shall be sorry for that now. But it
must be told."</p>

<p>Emily felt a sudden distaste for hearing whatever it was Mrs.
Kent had to tell. It had&mdash;must have&mdash;something to do with
Teddy. And she did not want to hear
anything&mdash;<i>anything</i>&mdash;about Teddy now&mdash;Teddy
who would be Ilse's husband in two weeks.</p>

<p>"Don't you think&mdash;perhaps&mdash;it would be better not to
tell me?"</p>

<p>"It must be told. I have committed a wrong and I must confess
it. I cannot undo it&mdash;I suppose it is too late to undo
it&mdash;but it must be told. But there are other things that must
be told first. Things I've never spoken of&mdash;things that have
been torturing me until I've screamed out loud at night sometimes
with the anguish of them. Oh, you will never forgive me&mdash;but I
think you will be a little sorry for me."</p>

<p>"I've always felt sorry for you, Mrs. Kent."</p>

<p>"I think you did&mdash;yes, I think you did. But you couldn't
realize it all. Emily, I wasn't like this when I was a girl. I
was&mdash;like other people then. And I was pretty&mdash;indeed I
was. When David Kent came and made me love him I was pretty. And he
loved me&mdash;<i>then</i>&mdash;and he always loved me. He says so
in this letter."</p>

<p>She plucked it from the bosom of her dress and kissed it almost
savagely.</p>

<p>"I can't let you see it, Emily. No eyes but mine must ever see
it. But I'll tell you what is in it. Oh, you can't know&mdash;you
can't understand how much I loved him, Emily. You think you love
Teddy. But you don't&mdash;you <i>can't</i> love him as I loved his
father."</p>

<p>Emily had a different opinion on this point, but she did not say
so.</p>

<p>"He married me and took me home to Malton where his people
lived. We were so happy at first&mdash;too happy. I told you God
was jealous. And his people did not like me&mdash;not from the
first. They thought David had married beneath him&mdash;that I
wasn't good enough for him. They were always trying to come between
us. Oh, I knew; I knew what they were after. His mother hated me.
She never called me Aileen&mdash;only 'you' and 'David's wife.' I
hated her because she was always watching me&mdash;never said
anything&mdash;never did anything. Just <i>watched</i> me. I was
never one of them. I never seemed able to understand their jokes.
They were always laughing over something&mdash;me, half the time, I
thought. They would write letters to David and never mention me.
Some of them were always freezingly polite to me and some of them
were always giving me digs. Once one of his sisters sent me a book
on etiquette. Something was always hurting me&mdash;and I couldn't
strike back&mdash;I couldn't hurt what was hurting me. David took
their part&mdash;he had secrets with them he kept from me. But in
spite of it all I was happy&mdash;till I dropped the lamp and my
dress caught fire and scarred my face like this. After that I
couldn't believe David could keep on loving me. I was so ugly. My
nerves got raw and I couldn't help quarrelling with him over every
trifle. But he was patient. He forgave me again and again. Only I
was so afraid he couldn't love me with that scar. I knew I was
going to have a baby, but I kept putting off telling him. I was
afraid he would love it more than he did me. And then&mdash;I did a
terrible thing. I hate to tell you of it. David had a dog&mdash;he
loved it so much that I hated it I&mdash;I poisoned it. I don't
know what possessed me. I never used to be like that&mdash;not till
I was burned. Perhaps it was because the baby was coming."</p>

<p>Mrs. Kent stopped and changed suddenly from a woman quivering
with unveiled feeling to a prim Victorian.</p>

<p>"I shouldn't talk about such matters to a young girl," she said
anxiously.</p>

<p>"I have known for some years that babies do not come in Dr.
Burnley's black bag," assured Emily gravely.</p>

<p>"Well"&mdash;Mrs. Kent underwent another transformation into
passionate Aileen Kent again&mdash;"David found out what I had
done. Oh&mdash;oh, his face! We had a dreadful quarrel. It was just
before he went out to Winnipeg on a business trip. I&mdash;I was so
furious over what he said that I screamed out&mdash;oh,
Emily&mdash;that I hoped I would never see his face again. I never
did. God took me at my word. He died of pneumonia in Winnipeg. I
never knew he was ill till the word of his death came. And the
nurse was a girl he had once thought something of and who loved
him. <i>She</i> waited on him and tended him while I was at home
hating him. That is what I have thought I could never forgive God
for. She packed up his things and sent them home&mdash;that book
among them. He must have bought it in Winnipeg. I never opened
it&mdash;I never could bear to touch it. He must have written that
letter when he was near death and put it in the book for
me&mdash;and perhaps died before he could tell her it was there.
Maybe she knew and wouldn't tell me. And it has been there all
these years, Emily&mdash;all these years when I've been believing
David died angry with me&mdash;unforgiving me. I've dreamed of him
night after night&mdash;always with his face turned away from me.
Oh, twenty-seven years of that, Emily&mdash;twenty-seven years.
Think of it. Haven't I atoned! And last night I opened and read his
letter, Emily&mdash;just a few lines scribbled with a
pencil&mdash;his poor hand could hardly hold it. He called me Dear
Little Wife and said I must forgive him&mdash;<i>I</i> forgive
<i>him</i>&mdash;for being so harsh and angry that last
day&mdash;and he forgave me for what I had done&mdash;and said I
mustn't worry over it nor over what I had said about not seeing his
face again&mdash;he knew I didn't mean it&mdash;that he understood
things better at the last&mdash;and he had always loved me dearly
and always would&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;something more I can't
tell anybody&mdash;too dear, too wonderful. Oh, Emily, can you
imagine what this means to me&mdash;to know he didn't die angry
with me&mdash;that he died loving me and thinking tenderly of me?
But I didn't know it then. And I&mdash;I&mdash;don't think I've
ever been quite right since. I know all his people thought me
crazy. When Teddy was born I came up here away from them all. So
that they couldn't lure him away from me. I wouldn't take a cent
from them. I had David's insurance&mdash;we could just live on
that. Teddy was all I had&mdash;and <i>you</i> came&mdash;and I
knew you would take him from me. I knew he loved you&mdash;always.
Oh, yes he did. When he went away I used to write him of all your
flirtations. And two years ago&mdash;you remember he had to go to
Montreal so suddenly&mdash;and you were away&mdash;he couldn't wait
to say good-bye. But he wrote you a letter."</p>

<p>Emily gave a little choked cry of denial.</p>

<p>"Oh, he did. I saw it lying on his table when he had gone out. I
steamed the flap open and read it. I burned the letter,
Emily&mdash;but I can tell you what was in it. Could I ever forget!
He told you he had meant to tell you how much he loved you before
he went&mdash;and if you could care a little for him to write and
tell him so. But if you couldn't not to write at all. Oh, how I
hated you. I burned the letter and sealed up a copy of some poetry
verses that were in it. And he mailed it never knowing the
difference. I was never sorry&mdash;never, not even when he wrote
me he was going to marry Ilse. But last night&mdash;when you
brought me that letter&mdash;and forgiveness&mdash;and
peace&mdash;oh, I felt I had done an awful thing. I've ruined your
life&mdash;and perhaps Teddy's. Can you ever forgive me,
Emily?"</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>Emily, amid all the whirl of emotions roused by Mrs. Kent's
tale, was keenly conscious of only one thing.
Bitterness&mdash;humiliation&mdash;shame had vanished from her
being. Teddy <i>had</i> loved her. The sweetness of the revelation
blotted out, for the time at least, all other feelings.
Anger&mdash;resentment&mdash;could find no place in her soul. She
felt like a new creature. And there was sincerity in heart and tone
as she said slowly:</p>

<p>"I do&mdash;I do. I understand."</p>

<p>Mrs. Kent suddenly wrung her hands.</p>

<p>"Emily&mdash;is it too late? Is it too late? They're not married
yet&mdash;I know he doesn't love her as he loved you. If you told
him&mdash;if I told him&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no, no," cried Emily passionately. "It <i>is</i> too late.
He must never know&mdash;you must never tell him. He loves Ilse
now. I am sure of that&mdash;and telling him this would do no good
and much evil. Promise me&mdash;dear Mrs. Kent, if you feel you owe
me anything promise me, you'll never tell him."</p>

<p>"But you&mdash;you will be unhappy&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I will not be unhappy&mdash;not now. You don't know what a
difference this has made. The sting has gone out of everything. I
am going to have a happy, busy, useful life and regret for old
dreams will have no place in it. The wound will heal now."</p>

<p>"It was&mdash;a terrible thing for me to do," whispered Mrs.
Kent. "I see that&mdash;at last."</p>

<p>"I suppose it was. But I'm not thinking of that. Only that I've
got my self-respect back."</p>

<p>"The Murray pride," whispered Mrs. Kent, staring at her. "After
all, Emily Starr, I believe pride is a stronger passion with you
than love."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," said Emily smiling.</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p>She was in such a tumult of feeling when she reached home that
she did a thing she was always ashamed of. Perry Miller was waiting
in the New Moon garden for her. She had not seen him for a long
time and at any other hour would have been glad to see him. Perry's
friendship, now that he had finally given up all hope of anything
else, was a very pleasant part of her life. He had developed in the
last few years&mdash;he was manly, humorous, much less boastful. He
had even acquired certain fundamental rules of social etiquette and
learned not to have too many hands and feet. He was too busy to
come often to New Moon, but Emily always enjoyed his visits when he
did come&mdash;except tonight. She wanted to be alone&mdash;to
think things over&mdash;classify her emotions&mdash;revel in her
restored sense of self-respect. To pace up and down among the
silken poppy-ladies of the garden and talk with Perry was an almost
impossible thing. She was in a frenzy of impatience to be rid of
him. And Perry did not sense this at all. He had not seen her for a
long while&mdash;and there were many things to talk
over&mdash;Ilse's wedding in especial. He kept on asking questions
about it until Emily really didn't know what she was saying. Perry
was a bit squiffy over the fact that <i>he</i> had not been asked
to be groomsman. He thought he had a right to be&mdash;the old chum
of both.</p>

<p>"I never thought Teddy would turn me down cold like that," he
growled. "I suppose he feels himself too big to have Stovepipe Town
for groomsman."</p>

<p>Then Emily did her dreadful thing&mdash;before she realized what
she was saying, in her impatient annoyance with Perry for casting
such aspersions on Teddy the words leaped out quite
involuntarily.</p>

<p>"You goose. It wasn't Teddy at all. Do you think Ilse would have
<i>you</i> as groomsman&mdash;when she hoped for years you would be
the groom?"</p>

<p>The moment she had spoken she stood aghast, sick with shame and
remorse. What had she done? Betrayed friendship&mdash;violated
confidence&mdash;a shameful, unpardonable thing. Could <i>she,</i>
Emily Byrd Starr of New Moon, have done <i>this?</i></p>

<p>Perry was standing by the dial staring at her dumbfounded.</p>

<p>"Emily, you don't mean that. Ilse never thought of me that way,
did she?"</p>

<p>Emily miserably realized that the spoken word could not be
recalled and that the mess she had made of things couldn't be
mended by any fibs.</p>

<p>"She did&mdash;at one time. Of course she got over it long
ago."</p>

<p><i>"Me!</i> Why, Emily, she always seemed to despise
me&mdash;always ragging me about something&mdash;I never could
please her&mdash;you remember."</p>

<p>"Oh, I remember," said Emily wearily. "She thought so much of
you, she hated to see you fall below her standard. If she
hadn't&mdash;liked you&mdash;do you suppose she would have cared
what grammar you used or what etiquette you smashed? I should never
have told you this, Perry. I shall be ashamed of it all my life.
You must never let her suspect you know."</p>

<p>"Of course not. Anyhow, she's forgotten it long ago."</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;yes. But you can understand why it wouldn't be
especially agreeable for her to have you as best man at her
wedding. I hated to have you think Teddy such a snob. And now, you
won't mind, will you, Perry, if I ask you to go? I'm very
tired&mdash;and I've so much to do the next two weeks."</p>

<p>"You ought to be in bed, that's a fact," agreed Perry. "I'm a
beast to be keeping you up. But when I come here it seems so much
like old times I never want to go. What a set of shavers we were!
And now Ilse and Teddy are going to be married. We're getting on a
bit."</p>

<p>"Next thing you'll be a staid old married man yourself, Perry,"
said Emily, trying to smile. "I've been hearing things."</p>

<p>"Not on your life! I've given up that idea for good. Not that
I'm pining after you yet in particular&mdash;only nobody has any
flavour after you. I've tried. I'm doomed to die a bachelor. They
tell me it's an easy death. But I've got a few ambitions by the
tail and I'm not kicking about life. Bye-bye, dear. I'll see you at
the wedding. It's in the afternoon, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes." Emily wondered she could speak so calmly of it. "Three
o'clock&mdash;then supper&mdash;and a motor drive to Shrewsbury to
catch the evening boat. Perry, Perry, I wish I hadn't told you that
about Ilse. It was mean&mdash;mean&mdash;as we used to say at
school&mdash;I never thought I could do such a thing."</p>

<p>"Now, don't go worrying over that. I'm as tickled as a dog with
two tails to think Ilse ever thought that much of me, at any time.
Don't you think I've sense enough to know what a compliment it was?
And don't you think I understand what bricks you two girls always
were to me and how much I owe you for letting me be your friend?
I've never had any illusions about Stovepipe Town or the real
difference between us. I wasn't such a fool as not to understand
<i>that.</i> I've climbed a bit&mdash;I mean to climb
higher&mdash;but you and Ilse were <i>born</i> to it. And you never
let me feel the difference as some girls did. I shan't forget Rhoda
Stuart's dirty little slurs. So you don't think I'd be such a cur
now as to go strutting because I've found out Ilse once had a bit
of a fancy for me&mdash;or that I'd ever let her think I knew? I've
left that much of Stovepipe Town behind, anyhow&mdash;even if I
still have to think what fork I'll pick up first.
Emily&mdash;<i>do</i> you remember the night your Aunt Ruth caught
me kissing you?"*</p>

<p>*See <i>Emily Climbs.</i></p>

<p>"I should think I do."</p>

<p>"The only time I ever did kiss you," said Perry
non-sentimentally. "And <i>it</i> wasn't much of a shot, was it?
When I think of the old lady standing there in her nightgown with
the candle!"</p>

<p>Perry went off laughing and Emily went to her room.</p>

<p>"Emily-in-the-glass," she said almost gaily, "I can look you
squarely in the eyes again. I'm not ashamed any longer. He
<i>did</i> love me."</p>

<p>She stood there smiling for a little space. And then the smile
faded.</p>

<p>"Oh, if I had only got that letter!" she whispered
piteously.</p>

<hr><h2><a name="C25" id="C25"><i>Chapter XXV</i></a>
</h2>

<p><i>&nbsp;</i>
</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>Only two weeks till the wedding. Emily found out how long two
weeks can be, in spite of the fact that every waking moment was
crowded with doings, domestic and social. The affair was much
talked of everywhere. Emily set her teeth and went through with it.
Ilse was here&mdash;there&mdash;everywhere. Doing
nothing&mdash;saying much.</p>

<p>"About as composed as a flea," growled Dr. Burnley.</p>

<p>"Ilse has got to be such a restless creature," complained Aunt
Elizabeth. "She seems to be frightened people wouldn't know she was
alive if she sat still a moment."</p>

<p>"I've got forty-nine remedies for seasickness," said Ilse. "If
Aunt Kate Mitchell gets here I'll have fifty. Isn't it delightful
to have thoughtful relatives, Emily?"</p>

<p>They were alone in Ilse's room. It was the evening Teddy was
expected. Ilse had tried on half a dozen different dresses and
tossed them aside scornfully.</p>

<p>"Emily, <i>what</i> will I wear? Decide for me."</p>

<p>"Not I. Besides&mdash;what difference does it make what you put
on?"</p>

<p>"True&mdash;too true. Teddy never notices what I have on. I like
a man who <i>does</i> notice and tells me of it. I like a man who
likes me better in silk than in gingham."</p>

<p>Emily looked out of the window into a tangled garden where the
moonlight was an untroubled silver sea bearing softly on its breast
a fleet of poppies. "I meant that Teddy&mdash;won't think of your
dress&mdash;only of <i>you."</i></p>

<p>"Emily, why do you persist in talking as if you thought Teddy
and I were madly in love with each other? Is it that Victorian
complex of yours?"</p>

<p>"For heaven's sake, shut up about things Victorian!" Emily
exclaimed with unusual, un-Murray-like violence. "I'm tired of it.
You call every nice, simple, natural emotion Victorian. The whole
world to-day seems to be steeped in a scorn for things Victorian.
Do they know what they're talking of? But I like sane, decent
things&mdash;if <i>that</i> is Victorian."</p>

<p>"Emily, Emily, do you suppose Aunt Elizabeth would think it
either a sane or decent thing to be madly in love?"</p>

<p>Both girls laughed and the sudden tension relaxed.</p>

<p>"You're not off, Emily?"</p>

<p>"Of course I am. Do you think I'd play gooseberry at such a time
as this?"</p>

<p>"There you go again. Do <i>you</i> think I want to be shut up
alone a whole evening with undiluted Teddy. We'll have a scene
every few minutes over something. Of course scenes are lovely. They
brighten up life so. I've just got to have a scene once a week. You
know I always did enjoy a good fight. Remember how you and I used
to scrap? You haven't been a bit of good at a row lately. Even
Teddy is only half-hearted in a set-to. Perry, now&mdash;<i>he</i>
could fight. Think what gorgeous rows Perry and I would have had.
Our quarrels would have been splendid. Nothing petty&mdash;or
<i>quarrelsome</i>&mdash;about them. And how we would have loved
each other between them! O-hone-a-rie!"</p>

<p>"Are you hankering after Perry Miller yet?" demanded Emily
fiercely.</p>

<p>"No, dear infant. And neither am I crazy about Teddy. After all,
ours is only second-hand love on both sides, you know. Cold soup
warmed over. Don't worry. I'll be good for him. I'll keep him up to
the notch in everything much better than if I thought him a little
lower than the angels. It doesn't do to think a man is perfection
because <i>he</i> naturally thinks so, too, and when he finds some
one who agrees with him he is inclined to rest on his oars. It
riles me up a bit when every one seems to think I'm so amazingly
lucky to 'get' Teddy for a husband. Comes Aunt Ida
Mitchell&mdash;'You are getting a perfectly wonderful husband,
Ilse'&mdash;comes Bridget Mooney from Stovepipe Town scrubbing the
floor&mdash;'Gosh but you're gettin' a swell man,
Miss'&mdash;'Sisters under their skins,' you perceive. Teddy is
well enough&mdash;especially since he found out he isn't the only
man in the world. He has learned sense somewhere. I'd like to know
what girl taught it to him. Oh, there was one. He told me something
about the affair&mdash;not much but enough. She used to snub him
terribly&mdash;and then after she had led him on to think she cared
she turned him down cold. Never even answered the letter in which
he told her he loved her. I hate that girl, Emily&mdash;isn't it
odd?"</p>

<p>"Don't hate her," said Emily, wearily. "Perhaps she didn't know
what she was doing."</p>

<p>"I hate her for using Teddy like that. Though it did him heaps
of good. Why do I hate her, Emily? Employ your renowned skill in
psychological analysis and expound to me that mystery."</p>

<p>"You hate her&mdash;because&mdash;to borrow a certain crude
expression we've often heard&mdash;you're 'taking her
leavings.'"</p>

<p>"You demon! I suppose it's so. How ugly some things are when you
ferret them out! I've been flattering myself that it was a noble
hatred because she made Teddy suffer. After all, the Victorians
were right in covering lots of things up. Ugly things should be
hidden. Now, go home if go you must and I'll try to look like some
one about to receive a blessing."</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>Lorne Halsey came with Teddy&mdash;the great Halsey whom Emily
liked very much in spite of his gargoyleishness. A comical looking
fellow with vital, mocking eyes, who seemed to look upon everything
in general and Frederick Kent's wedding in particular as a huge
joke. Somehow, this attitude made things a little easier for Emily.
She was very brilliant and gay in the evenings they all spent
together. She was terribly afraid of silence in Teddy's presence.
"Never be silent with the person you love and distrust," Mr.
Carpenter had said once. "Silence betrays."</p>

<p>Teddy was very friendly, but his gaze always omitted Emily.
Once, when they all walked in the old, overgrown, willow-bordered
lawn of the Burnley place, Ilse stumbled on the happy idea of
pick-out your favourite star.</p>

<p>"Mine is Sirius. Lorne?"</p>

<p>"Antares of the Scorpion&mdash;the red star of the south," said
Halsey.</p>

<p>"Bellatrix of Orion," said Emily quickly. She had never thought
about Bellatrix before, but she dared not hesitate a moment before
Teddy.</p>

<p>"I have no especial favourite&mdash;there is only one star I
hate. Vega of the Lyre," said Teddy quietly. His voice was charged
with a significance which instantly made every one uncomfortable
though neither Halsey nor Ilse knew why. No more was said about
stars. But Emily watched alone till they faded out one by one in
the dawn.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>Three nights before the wedding-day Blair Water and Derry Pond
were much scandalized because Ilse Burnley had been seen driving
with Perry Miller in his new run-about at some ungodly hour. Ilse
coolly admitted it when Emily reproached her.</p>

<p>"Of course I did. I had had such a dull, bored evening with
Teddy. We began it well with a quarrel over my blue Chow. Teddy
said I cared more for it than I did for him. I said of course I
did. It infuriated him, though he didn't believe it. Teddy,
manlike, really believes I'm dying about him.</p>

<p>"'A dog that never chased a cat in its life,' he sneered.</p>

<p>"Then we both sulked the rest of the evening. He went home at
eleven without kissing me. I resolved I'd do something foolish and
beautiful for the last time, so I sneaked down the lane for a
lovely, lonely walk down to the dunes. Perry came along in his car
and I just changed my mind and went for a little moonlit spin with
him. I wasn't married <i>yet.</i> Don't be after looking at me so.
We only stayed out till one and we were really very good and
proper. I only wondered once&mdash;just what would happen if I
suddenly said, 'Perry, darling, <i>you're</i> the only man I've
ever really cared a hang for. Why can't <i>we</i> get married?' I
wonder if when I'm eighty I'll wish I'd said it."</p>

<p>"You told me you had quite got over caring for Perry.'</p>

<p>"But did you believe me? Emily, thank God you're not a
Burnley."</p>

<p>Emily reflected bitterly that it was not much better being a
Murray. If it had not been for her Murray pride she would have gone
to Teddy the night he called her&mdash;and she would have been
tomorrow's bride&mdash;not Ilse.</p>

<p>To-morrow. It was to-morrow&mdash;the morrow when she would have
to stand near Teddy and hear him vowing lifelong devotion to
another woman. All was in readiness. A wedding-supper that pleased
even Dr. Burnley, who had decreed that there should be "a good,
old-fashioned wedding-supper&mdash;none of your modern dabs of this
and that. The bride and groom mayn't want much maybe, but the rest
of us still have stomachs. And this is the first wedding for years.
We've been getting pretty much like heaven in one respect
anyhow&mdash;neither marrying nor giving in marriage. I want a
spread. And tell Laura for heaven's sake not to yowl at the
wedding."</p>

<p>So Aunts Elizabeth and Laura saw to it that for the first time
in twenty years the Burnley house had a thorough cleaning from top
to bottom. Dr. Burnley thanked God forcibly several times that he
would only have to go through this once, but nobody paid any
attention to him. Elizabeth and Laura had new satin dresses made.
It was such a long time since they had had any excuse for new satin
dresses.</p>

<p>Aunt Elizabeth made the wedding-cakes and saw to the hams and
chickens. Laura made creams and jellies and salads and Emily
carried them over to the Burnley Place, wondering at times if she
wouldn't soon wake up&mdash;before&mdash;before&mdash;</p>

<p>"I'll be glad when all this fuss is over," growled Cousin Jimmy.
"Emily's working herself to death&mdash;look at the eyes of
her!"</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>"Stay with me to-night, Emily," entreated Ilse. "I swear I won't
talk you to death and I won't cry either. Though I admit if I could
just be snuffed out to-night like a candle I wouldn't mind. Jean
Askew was Milly Hyslop's bridesmaid and she spent the night before
her wedding with her and they both cried all night. Fancy such an
orgy of tears. Milly cried because she was going to be
married&mdash;and I suppose Jean must have been crying because she
wasn't. Thank heaven, Emily, you and I were never the miauling
kind. We'll be more likely to fight than cry, won't we? I wonder if
Mrs. Kent will come to-morrow? I don't suppose so. Teddy says she
never mentions his marriage. Though he says she seem oddly
changed&mdash;gentler&mdash;calmer&mdash;more like other women.
Emily, do you realize that by this time to-morrow I'll be Ilse
Kent?"</p>

<p>Yes, Emily realized <i>that.</i></p>

<p>They said nothing more. But two hours later when wakeful Emily
had supposed the motionless Ilse was sound asleep Ilse suddenly sat
up in bed and grabbed Emily's hand in the darkness.</p>

<p>"Emily&mdash;if one could only go to sleep unmarried&mdash;and
wake up married&mdash;how nice it would be."</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p>It was dawn&mdash;the dawn of Ilse's wedding-day. Ilse was
sleeping when Emily slipped out of bed and went to the window.
Dawn. A cluster of dark pines in a trance of calm down by the Blair
Water. The air tremulous with elfin music; the wind winnowing the
dunes; dancing amber waves on the harbour; the eastern sky abloom;
the lighthouse at the harbour pearl-white against the ethereal sky;
beyond all the blue field of the sea with its foam blossoms and
behind that golden haze that swathed the hill of the Tansy Patch,
Teddy&mdash;wakeful&mdash;waiting&mdash;welcoming the day that gave
him his heart's desire. Emily's soul was washed empty of every wish
or hope or desire except that the day were over.</p>

<p>"It is," she thought, "comforting when a thing becomes
irrevocable."</p>

<p>"Emily&mdash;Emily."</p>

<p>Emily turned from the window.</p>

<p>"It's a lovely day, Ilse. The sun will shine on you.
Ilse&mdash;what is the matter? Ilse&mdash;you're crying!"</p>

<p>"I can't&mdash;help it," sniffed Ilse. "It seems to be the
proper, inescapable caper after all. I beg Milly's pardon.
But&mdash;I'm so beastly afraid. It's an infernal sensation. Do you
think it would do any good if I threw myself on the floor and
screamed?"</p>

<p>"What are you afraid of?" said Emily, a little impatiently.</p>

<p>"Oh,"&mdash;Ilse sprang defiantly out of bed&mdash;"afraid I'll
stick my tongue out at the minister. What else?"</p>

<h3>VI</h3>

<p>What a morning! It always seemed a sort of nightmare
recollection to Emily. Guests of the clan came early&mdash;Emily
welcomed them until she felt that the smile must be frozen on her
face. There were endless wedding-gifts to unwrap and arrange. Ilse,
before she dressed, came to look them over indifferently.</p>

<p>"Who sent in that afternoon tea-set?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Perry," said Emily. She had helped him choose it. A dainty
service in a quaint old-fashioned rose design. A card with Perry's
black forcible handwriting. "To Ilse with the best wishes of her
old friend Perry."</p>

<p>Ilse deliberately picked up piece after piece and dashed it in
fragments on the floor before the transfixed Emily could stop
her.</p>

<p><i>"Ilse!</i> Have you gone crazy?"</p>

<p>"There! What a glorious smash! Sweep up the fragments, Emily.
That was just as good as screaming on the floor. Better. I can go
through with it now."</p>

<p>Emily disposed of the fragments just in time&mdash;Mrs. Clarinda
Mitchell came billowing in, in pale-blue muslin and cherry-hued
scarf. A sonsy, smiling, good-hearted cousin-by-marriage.
Interested in everything. Who gave this?&mdash;Who had sent
that?</p>

<p>"She'll be <i>such</i> a sweet bride, I'm sure," gushed Mrs.
Clarinda. "And Teddy Kent is <i>such</i> a splendid fellow. It's
really an ideal marriage, isn't it? One of those you read about! I
love weddings like this. I thank my stars I didn't lose my interest
in youthful things when I lost my youth. I've lots of sentiment in
me yet&mdash;and I'm not afraid to show it. And <i>did</i> Ilse's
wedding stockings really cost fourteen dollars?"</p>

<p>Aunt Isabella Hyslop, <i>nee</i> Mitchell, was gloomy. Offended
because her costly present of cut sherbet glasses had been placed
beside Cousin Annabel's funny set of old-fashioned crocheted
doilies. Inclined to take a dark view of things.</p>

<p>"I hope everything will go off well. But I've got an uneasy
feeling that trouble is coming&mdash;a presentiment, so to speak.
Do you believe in signs? A big black cat ran right across the road
in front of us down in the hollow. And right on that tree as we
turned in at the lane was the fragment of an old election poster,
'Blue Ruin,' in black letters three inches long staring us in the
face."</p>

<p>"That might mean bad luck for you, but hardly for Ilse."</p>

<p>Aunt Isabella shook her head. She would <i>not</i> be
comforted.</p>

<p>"They say the wedding dress is like nothing ever seen on Prince
Edward Island. <i>Do</i> you think such extravagance proper, Miss
Starr!"</p>

<p>"The expensive part of it was a present from Ilse's old
great-aunts in Scotland, Mrs. Mitchell. And most of us are married
only once."</p>

<p>Whereupon Emily remembered that Aunt Isabella had been married
three times and wondered if there wasn't something in black cat
magic.</p>

<p>Aunt Isabella swept coldly off, and later on was heard to say
that "that Starr girl is really intolerable since she got a book
published. Thinks herself at liberty to insult any one."</p>

<p>Emily, before she had time to thank the Fates for her freedom,
fell into the clutches of more Mitchell relatives. This aunt did
not approve of another aunt's gift of a pair of ornate Bohemian
glass vases.</p>

<p>"Bessie Jane never had much sense. A foolish choice. The
children will be sure to unhook the prisms and lose them."</p>

<p>"What children?"</p>

<p>"Why, the children they will have, of course."</p>

<p>"Miss Starr will put that in a book, Matilda," warned her
husband, chuckling. Then he chuckled again and whispered to
Emily:</p>

<p>"Why aren't <i>you</i> the bride to-day? How come Ilse to cut
you out, hey?"</p>

<p>Emily was thankful when she was summoned upstairs to help Ilse
dress. Though even here aunts and cousins kept bobbing in and out,
saying distracting things.</p>

<p>"Emily, do you remember the day of our first summer together
when we fought over the honour of playing bride in one of our
dramatic stunts? Well, I feel as if I were just playing bride. This
isn't real."</p>

<p>Emily felt, too, as if it were not real. But soon&mdash;soon
now&mdash;it would be all over and she could be blessedly alone.
And Ilse when dressed was such an exquisite bride that she
justified all the fuss of the wedding. How Teddy <i>must</i> love
her!</p>

<p>"Doesn't she look just like a queen?" whispered Aunt Laura
adoringly.</p>

<p>Emily having slipped into her own harebell blue kissed the
flushed maiden face under the rose-point cap and pearls of its
bridal veil.</p>

<p>"Ilse dear, don't think me hopelessly Victorian if I say I hope
you'll be happy 'ever after.'"</p>

<p>Ilse squeezed her hand, but laughed a little too loudly.</p>

<p>"I hope it isn't Queen Victoria Aunt Laura thinks I resemble,"
she whispered. "And I have the most horrible suspicion that Aunt
Janie Milburn is praying for me. Her face betrayed her when she
came in to kiss me. It always makes me furious to suspect that
people are praying for me. Now, Emily, do me one last favour. Herd
everybody out of this room&mdash;everybody. I want to be alone,
absolutely alone, for a few minutes."</p>

<p>Somehow Emily managed it. The aunts and cousins fluttered
downstairs. Dr. Burnley was waiting impatiently in the hall.</p>

<p>"Won't you soon be ready? Teddy and Halsey are waiting for the
signal to go into the drawing-room."</p>

<p>"Ilse wants a few minutes alone. Oh, Aunt Ida, I'm so glad you
got here"&mdash;to a stout lady who was coming pantingly up the
stairs. "We were afraid something had happened to prevent you."</p>

<p>"Something did," gasped Aunt Ida&mdash;who was really a
second-cousin. In spite of her breathlessness Aunt Ida was happy.
She always liked to be the first to tell a piece of
news&mdash;especially unpleasant news. "And the doctor couldn't
come at all&mdash;I had to get a taxi. That poor Perry
Miller&mdash;you know him, don't you? Such a clever young
chap&mdash;was killed in a motor collision about an hour ago."</p>

<p>Emily stifled a shriek, with a frantic glance at Ilse's door. It
was slightly ajar. Dr. Burnley was saying:</p>

<p>"Perry Miller killed. Good God, how horrible!"</p>

<p>"Well, as good as killed. He must be dead by this time&mdash;he
was unconscious when they dragged him out of the wreck. They took
him to the Charlottetown hospital and 'phoned for Bill, who dashed
right off, of course. It's a mercy Ilse isn't marrying a doctor.
Have I time to take off my things before the ceremony?"</p>

<p>Emily, crushing her anguish over Perry, showed Aunt Ida to the
spare room and returned to Dr. Burnley.</p>

<p>"Don't let Ilse know about this," he cautioned needlessly. "It
would spoil her wedding&mdash;she and Perry were old cronies. And
hadn't you better hurry her up a little? It's past the time."</p>

<p>Emily, with more of a nightmare feeling than ever, went down the
hall and knocked on Ilse's door. There was no answer. She opened
the door. On the floor in a forlorn heap lay the bridal veil and
the priceless bouquet of orchids which must have cost Teddy more
than any Murray or Burnley bride had ever paid before for her whole
trousseau, but Ilse was nowhere to be seen. A window was open, the
one over the kitchen stoop.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" exclaimed Dr. Burnley impatiently, coming
up behind Emily. "Where's Ilse?"</p>

<p>"She's&mdash;gone," said Emily stupidly</p>

<p>"Gone&mdash;gone where?"</p>

<p>"To Perry Miller." Emily knew it quite well. Ilse had heard Aunt
Ida and&mdash;</p>

<p>"Damn!" said Dr. Burnley.</p>

<h3>VIII</h3>

<p>In a few moments the house was a scene of consternation and
flabbergasted wedding guests, all exclaiming and asking questions.
Dr. Burnley lost his head and turned himself loose, running through
his whole repertoire of profanity, regardless of women-folks.</p>

<p>Even Aunt Elizabeth was paralysed. There was no precedent to go
by. Juliet Murray, to be sure, had eloped. But she had got married.
No clan bride had ever done anything like <i>this.</i> Emily alone
retained some power of rational thought and action. It was she who
found out from young Rob Mitchell how Ilse had gone. He had been
parking his car in the barnyard when&mdash;</p>

<p>"I saw her spring out of that window with her train wrapped
around her shoulders. She slid down the roof and jumped to the
ground like a cat&mdash;tore out to the lane, jumped in Ken
Mitchell's runabout and was off like the devil was after her. I
thought she must have gone crazy."</p>

<p>"She has&mdash;in a way. Rob, you must go after her.
Wait&mdash;I'll get Dr. Burnley to go with you. I must stay here to
see to things. Oh, be as quick as you can. It's only fourteen miles
to Charlottetown. You can go and come in an hour. You <i>must</i>
bring her back&mdash;I'll tell the guests to wait&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You'll not make much out of this mess, Emily," prophesied
Rob.</p>

<h3>IX</h3>

<p>Even an hour like that passed. But Dr. Burnley and Rob returned
alone. Ilse would not come&mdash;that was all there was to it.
Perry Miller was not killed&mdash;was not even seriously
injured&mdash;but Ilse would not come. She told her father that she
was going to marry Perry Miller and nobody else.</p>

<p>The doctor was the centre of a little group of dismayed and
tearful women in the upper hall. Aunt Elizabeth, Aunt Laura, Aunt
Ruth, Emily.</p>

<p>"I suppose if her mother had lived this wouldn't have happened,"
said the doctor dazedly. "I never dreamed she cared for Miller. I
wish somebody had wrung Ida Mitchell's neck in time. Oh,
cry&mdash;cry&mdash;yes, cry"&mdash;fiercely to poor Aunt Laura.
"What good will yelping do? What a devil of a mess! Somebody's got
to tell Kent&mdash;I suppose I must. And those distracted fools
down there have to be fed. That's what half of them came for,
anyway. Emily, you seem to be the only creature left in the world
with a grain of sense. See to things, there's a good girl."</p>

<p>Emily was not of an hysterical temperament, but for the second
time in her life she was feeling that the only thing she could do
would be to scream as loud and long as possible. Things had got to
the point where only screaming would clear the air. But she got the
guests marshalled to the tables. Excitement calmed down somewhat
when they found they were not to be cheated out of everything. But
the wedding-feast was hardly a success.</p>

<p>Even those who were hungry had an uneasy feeling that it wasn't
the thing to eat heartily under such circumstances. Nobody enjoyed
it except old Uncle Tom Mitchell, who frankly went to weddings for
the spread and didn't care whether there was a ceremony or not.
Brides might come and brides might go but a square meal was a feed.
So he ate steadily away, only pausing now and then to shake his
head solemnly and ask, "What air the women coming to?"</p>

<p>Cousin Isabella was set up on presentiments for life, but nobody
listened to her. Most of the guests were afraid to speak, for fear
of saying the wrong thing. Uncle Oliver reflected that he had seen
many funeral repasts that were more cheerful. The waitresses were
hurried and flurried and made ludicrous mistakes. Mrs. Derwent, the
young and pretty wife of the new minister, looked to be on the
point of tears&mdash;nay, actually had tears in her eyes. Perhaps
she had been building on the prospective wedding fee. Perhaps its
loss meant no new hat for her. Emily, glancing at her as she passed
a jelly, wanted to laugh&mdash;a desire as hysterical as her wish
to scream. But no desire at all showed itself on her cold white
face. Shrewsbury people said she was as disdainful and indifferent
as always. Could <i>anything</i> really make that girl
<i>feel?</i></p>

<p>And under it all she was keenly conscious of only one question.
"Where was Teddy? What was he feeling&mdash;thinking&mdash;doing?"
She hated Ilse for hurting him&mdash;shaming him. She did not see
how <i>anything</i> could go on after <i>this.</i> It was one of
those events which <i>must</i> stop time.</p>

<h3>X</h3>

<p>"What a day!" sobbed Aunt Laura as they walked home in the dusk.
"What a disgrace! What a scandal!"</p>

<p>"Allan Burnley has only himself to blame," said Aunt Elizabeth.
"He has let Ilse do absolutely as she pleases all her life. She was
never taught any self-control. All her life she had done exactly as
she wanted to do whenever the whim took her. No sense of
responsibility whatever."</p>

<p>"But if she loved Perry Miller," pleaded Laura.</p>

<p>"Why did she promise to marry Teddy Kent then? And treat him
like this? No, you need make no excuses for Ilse. Fancy a Burnley
going to Stovepipe Town for a husband.</p>

<p>"Some one will have to see about sending the presents back,"
moaned Laura. "I locked the door of the room where they were. One
never knows&mdash;at such a time&mdash;"</p>

<p>Emily found herself alone in her room at last&mdash;too dazed,
stricken, exhausted, to feel much of anything. A huge, round,
striped ball unrolled itself on her bed and opened wide pink
jaws.</p>

<p>"Daff," said Emily wearily, "you're the only thing in the world
that stays put."</p>

<p>She had a nasty sleepless night with a brief dawn slumber. From
which she wakened to a new world where everything had to be
readjusted. And she felt too tired to care for readjustment.</p>

<hr><h2><a name="C26" id="C26"><i>Chapter XXVI</i></a>
</h2>

<p><i>&nbsp;</i>
</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>Ilse did not look as if she wanted excuses made for her when,
two days later, she walked unannounced into Emily's room. She
looked rosy, audacious, triumphant.</p>

<p>Emily stared at her.</p>

<p>"Well, I suppose the earthquake is over. What is left
standing?"</p>

<p>"Ilse! How could you!"</p>

<p>Ilse pulled a notebook out of her handbag and pretended to
consult it.</p>

<p>"I wrote down a list of the things you'd say. That was the first
one. You've said it. The next is, 'Aren't you ashamed of yourself?'
I'm not, you know,' added Ilse impudently.</p>

<p>"I know you're not. That's why I don't ask it."</p>

<p>"I'm not ashamed&mdash;and I'm not sorry. I'm only a little bit
sorry that I'm <i>not</i> sorry. And I'm shamelessly happy. But I
suppose I spoiled the party. No doubt the old meows are having the
time of their lives. They've got their craws full for once."</p>

<p>"How do you suppose Teddy is feeling?" asked Emily sternly.</p>

<p>"Is he feeling any worse than Dean did? There's an old proverb
about glass houses."</p>

<p>Emily crimsoned.</p>

<p>"I know&mdash;I used Dean badly&mdash;but I didn't&mdash;</p>

<p>"Jilt him at the altar! True. But I didn't think about Teddy at
all when I heard Aunt Ida say Perry was killed. I was quite mad. My
one thought was to see Perry once before he died. I <i>had</i> to.
And I found when I got there that, as Mark Twain said, the report
of his death was greatly exaggerated. He wasn't even badly
hurt&mdash;was sitting up in bed, his face all bruised and
bandaged&mdash;looking like the devil. Want to hear what happened,
Emily?"</p>

<p>Ilse dropped on the floor at Emily's feet&mdash;and looked
coaxingly up into Emily's face.</p>

<p>"Honey, what's the use of disapproving a thing that was
foreordained? That won't alter anything. I got a glimpse of Aunt
Laura in the sitting-room as I sneaked upstairs. She was looking
like something that had been left out overnight. But you have a
streak in you that isn't Murray. <i>You</i> should understand.
Don't waste your sympathy on Teddy. He doesn't love me&mdash;I've
always known it. It's only his conceit that will suffer.
Here&mdash;give him his sapphire for me, will you?" Ilse saw
something in Emily's face she didn't like. "It can go to join
Dean's emerald."</p>

<p>"Teddy left for Montreal the day after&mdash;after&mdash;"</p>

<p>"After the wedding that wasn't," finished Ilse. "Did you see
him, Emily?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Well, if he'd go and shoot big game in Africa for awhile he'd
get over it very quickly. Emily, I'm going to marry
Perry&mdash;next year. It's all settled. I fell on his neck and
kissed him as soon as I saw him. I let go my train and it streamed
magnificently over the floor. I knew the nurse thought I had just
got out of Dr. Percy's private asylum. But I turned her out of the
room. And I told Perry I loved him and that I would never, never
marry Teddy Kent no matter what happened&mdash;and then he asked me
if I'd marry <i>him</i>&mdash;or I told him he must marry
me&mdash;or neither of us asked&mdash;we just understood. I
honestly don't remember which&mdash;and I don't care. Emily, if I
were dead and Perry came and looked at me I'd live again. Of course
I know he's always been after you&mdash;but he's going to love me
as he never loved you. We were made for each other."</p>

<p>"Perry was never really in love with me," said Emily. "He liked
me tremendously, that was all. He didn't know the
difference&mdash;then." She looked down into Ilse's radiant
face&mdash;and all her old, old love for this perverse, adorable
friend rushed to eyes and lips.</p>

<p>"Dearest, I hope you'll be happy&mdash;always."</p>

<p>"How blessedly Victorian that sounds!" said Ilse contentedly.
"Oh, I can be quiet now, Emily. For weeks I've been afraid that if
I let myself be quiet for a moment I'd <i>bolt.</i> And I don't
even mind if Aunt Janie is praying for me. I believe I rather hope
she is."</p>

<p>"What does your father say?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Dad." Ilse shrugged her shoulders. "He's still in the
clutches of his old ancestral temper. Won't speak to me. But he'll
come round. He's really as much to blame as I am for what I've
done. You know I've never asked anyone in my life if I could do a
thing. I just did it. Father never prevented me. At first because
he hated me&mdash;then because he wanted to make up for hating
me."</p>

<p>"I think you'll have to ask Perry sometimes if you can do
things."</p>

<p>"I won't mind <i>that.</i> You'll be surprised to see what a
dutiful wife I'll make. Of course I'm going right away&mdash;back
to work. And in a year's time people will have forgotten&mdash;and
Perry and I will be married quietly somewhere. No more rose-point
veils and Oriental trains and clan weddings for me. Lord, what an
escape! Then minutes later I'd have been married to Teddy. Think
what a scandal there'd have been then when Aunt Ida arrived.
Because I'd have gone just the same, you know."</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>That summer was a hard time for Emily. The very anguish of her
suffering had filled life and now that it was over she realized its
emptiness. Then, too, to go anywhere meant martyrdom. Everyone
talking about the wedding, asking, wondering, surmising. But at
last the wild gossip and clatter over Ilse's kididoes had finally
died away and people found something else to talk about. Emily was
left alone.</p>

<p>Alone? Ay, that was it. Always alone. Love&mdash;friendship gone
forever. Nothing left but ambition. Emily settled herself
resolutely down to work. Life ran again in its old accustomed
grooves. Year after year the seasons walked by her door.
Violet-sprinkled valleys of spring&mdash;blossom-script of
summer&mdash;minstrel-firs of autumn&mdash;pale fires of the Milky
Way on winter nights&mdash;soft, new-mooned skies of
April&mdash;gnomish beauty of dark Lombardies against a
moonrise&mdash;deep of sea calling to deep of wind&mdash;lonely
yellow leaves falling in October dusks&mdash;woven moonlight in the
orchard. Oh, there was beauty in life still&mdash;always would be.
Immortal, indestructible beauty beyond all the stain and blur of
mortal passion. She had some very glorious hours of inspiration and
achievement. But mere beauty which had once satisfied her soul
could not wholly satisfy it now. New Moon was unchanged,
undisturbed by the changes that came elsewhere. Mrs. Kent had gone
to live with Teddy. The old Tansy Patch was sold to some Halifax
man for a summer home. Perry went to Montreal one autumn and
brought Ilse back with him. They were living happily in
Charlottetown, where Emily often visited them, astutely evading the
matrimonial traps Ilse was always setting for her. It was becoming
an accepted thing in the clan that Emily would not marry.</p>

<p>"Another old maid at New Moon," as Uncle Wallace said
gracefully.</p>

<p>"And to think of all the men she might have had," said Aunt
Elizabeth bitterly. "Mr. Wallace&mdash;Aylmer
Vincent&mdash;Andrew&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But if she didn't&mdash;love&mdash;them," faltered Aunt
Laura.</p>

<p>"Laura, you need not be indelicate."</p>

<p>Old Kelly, who still went his rounds&mdash;"and will till the
crack of doom," declared Ilse&mdash;had quite given up teasing
Emily about getting married, though he occasionally made regretful,
cryptic allusions to "toad ointment." There was none of his
significant nods and winks. Instead, he always gravely asked her
what book she did be working on now, and drove off shaking his
spiky gray head. "What do the men be thinking of, anyway? Get up,
my nag, get up."</p>

<p>Some men were still thinking of Emily, it appeared. Andrew, now
a brisk young widower, would have come at the beck of a finger
Emily never lifted. Graham Mitchell, of Shrewsbury, unmistakably
had intentions. Emily wouldn't have him because he had a slight
cast in one eye. At least, that was what the Murrays supposed. They
could think of no other reason for her refusal of so good a match.
Shrewsbury people declared that he figured in her next novel and
that she had only been "leading him on" to "get material." A
reputed Klondike "millionaire" pursued her for a winter, but
disappeared as briefly in the spring.</p>

<p>"Since she has published those books she thinks no one good
enough for her," said Blair Water folks.</p>

<p>Aunt Elizabeth did not regret the Klondike man&mdash;he was only
a Derry Pond Butterworth, to begin with, and what were the
Butterworths? Aunt Elizabeth always contrived to give the
impression that Butterworths did not exist. They might imagine they
did, but the Murrays knew better. But she did not see why Emily
could not take Mooresby, of the firm of Mooresby and Parker,
Charlottetown. Emily's explanation that Mr. Mooresby could never
live down the fact that he had once had his picture in the papers
as a Perkins' Food Baby struck Aunt Elizabeth as very inadequate.
But Aunt Elizabeth at last admitted that she could not understand
the younger generation.</p>

<p>Of Teddy Emily never heard, save from occasional items in
newspapers which represented him as advancing steadily in his
career. He was beginning to have an international reputation as a
portrait painter. The old days of magazine illustrations were gone
and Emily was never now confronted with her own face&mdash;or her
own smile&mdash;or her own eyes&mdash;looking out at her from some
casual page.</p>

<p>One winter Mrs. Kent died. Before her death she sent Emily a
brief note&mdash;the only word Emily had ever had from her.</p>

<p>"I am dying. When I am dead, Emily, tell Teddy about the letter.
I've tried to tell him, but I couldn't. I couldn't tell my son I
had done <i>that.</i> Tell him for me."</p>

<p>Emily smiled sadly as she put the letter away. It was too late
to tell Teddy. He had long since ceased to care for her. And
she&mdash;she would love him for ever. And even though he knew it
not, surely such love would hover around him all his life like an
invisible benediction, not understood but dimly felt, guarding him
from ill and keeping from him all things of harm and evil.</p>

<p>That same winter it was bruited abroad that Jim Butterworth, of
Derry Pond, had bought or was about to buy the Disappointed House.
He meant, so rumour said, to haul it away, rebuild and enlarge it;
and doubtless when this was done he would install therein as
mistress a certain buxom, thrifty damsel of Derry Pond known as
"Geordie Bridge's Mabel." Emily heard the report with anguish. She
slipped out that evening in the chill spring dusk and went up the
dim overgrown path over the spruce hill to the front gate of the
little house like an unquiet ghost. Surely it couldn't be true that
Dean had sold it. The house belonged to the hill. One couldn't
imagine the hill without it.</p>

<p>Once Emily had got Aunt Laura to see about bringing her own
belongings from it&mdash;all but the gazing-ball. She could not
bear to see that. It must be still hanging there, reflecting in its
silver gloom by the dim light that fell through the slits of the
shutters, the living-room just as it was when she and Dean had
parted. Rumour said Dean had taken nothing from it. All he had put
in it was still there.</p>

<p>The little house must be very cold. It was so long since there
was a fire in it. How neglected&mdash;how lonely&mdash;how
heartbroken it looked. No light in the window&mdash;grass growing
thickly over the paths&mdash;rank weeds crowding around the
long-unopened door.</p>

<p>Emily stretched out her arms as if she wanted to put them around
the house. Daff rubbed against her ankles and purred pleadingly. He
did not like damp, chilly prowls&mdash;the fireside at New Moon was
better for a pussy not so young as he once was. Emily lifted the
old cat and set him on the crumbling gatepost.</p>

<p>"Daff," she said, "there is an old fireplace in that
house&mdash;with the ashes of a dead fire in it&mdash;a fireplace
where pussies should bask and children dream. And that will never
happen now, Daff, for Mabel Geordie doesn't like open
fireplaces&mdash;dirty, dusty things&mdash;a Quebec heater is so
much warmer and more economical. Don't you wish&mdash;or <i>do</i>
you!&mdash;Daff, that you and I had been born sensible creatures,
alive to the superior advantages of Quebec heaters!"</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>It came clearly and suddenly on the air of a June evening. An
old, old call&mdash;two higher notes and one long and soft and low.
Emily Starr, dreaming at her window, heard it and stood up, her
face suddenly gone white. Dreaming still&mdash;she must be! Teddy
Kent was thousands of miles away, in the Orient&mdash;so much she
knew from an item in a Montreal paper. Yes, she had dreamed
it&mdash;imagined it.</p>

<p>It came again. And Emily <i>knew</i> that Teddy was there,
waiting for her in Lofty John's bush&mdash;calling to her across
the years. She went down slowly&mdash;out&mdash;across the garden.
Of course Teddy was there&mdash;under the firs. It seemed the most
natural thing in the world that he should come to her there, in
that old-world garden where the three Lombardies still kept guard.
Nothing was wanting to bridge the years. There was no gulf. He put
out his hands and drew her to him, with no conventional greeting.
And spoke as if there were no years&mdash;no memories&mdash;between
them.</p>

<p>"Don't tell me you can't love me&mdash;you can&mdash;you
must&mdash;why, Emily"&mdash;his eyes had met the moonlit
brilliance of hers for a moment&mdash;"you <i>do."</i></p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>"It's dreadful what little things lead people to misunderstand
each other," said Emily some minutes&mdash;or
hours&mdash;later.</p>

<p>"I've been trying all my life to tell you I loved you," said
Teddy. "Do you remember that evening long ago in the To-morrow Road
after we left high school? Just as I was trying to screw up my
courage to ask you if you'd wait for me you said night air was bad
for you and went in. I thought it was a poor excuse for getting rid
of me&mdash;I knew you didn't care a hoot about night air. That set
me back for years. When I heard about you and Aylmer
Vincent&mdash;Mother wrote you were engaged&mdash;it was a nasty
shock. For the first time it occurred to me that you really didn't
belong to me, after all. And that winter when you were ill&mdash;I
was nearly wild. Away there in France where I couldn't see you. And
people writing that Dean Priest was always with you and would
probably marry you if you recovered. Then came the word that you
<i>were</i> going to marry him. I won't talk of that. But when
you&mdash;<i>you</i>&mdash;saved me from going to my death on the
<i>Flavian</i> I knew you <i>did</i> belong to me, once and for
all, whether <i>you</i> knew it or not. Then I tried again that
morning by Blair Water&mdash;and again you snubbed me mercilessly.
Shaking off my touch as if my hand were a snake. And you never
answered my letter. Emily, <i>why</i> didn't you? You say you've
always cared&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I never got the letter."</p>

<p>"Never got it? But I mailed it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know. I must tell you&mdash;she said I was to tell
you&mdash;" She told him briefly.</p>

<p>"My <i>mother?</i> Did <i>that?"</i></p>

<p>"You mustn't judge her harshly, Teddy. You know she wasn't like
other women. Her quarrel with your father&mdash;did you
know&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, she told me all about that&mdash;when she came to me in
Montreal. But <i>this</i>&mdash;Emily&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Let us just forget it&mdash;and forgive. She was so warped and
unhappy she didn't know what she was doing. And I&mdash;I&mdash;was
too proud&mdash;too proud to go when you called me that last time.
I <i>wanted</i> to go&mdash;but I thought you were only amusing
yourself&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I gave up hope then&mdash;finally. It had fooled me too often.
I saw you at your window, shining, as it seemed to me, with an icy
radiance like some cold wintry star&mdash;I knew you heard
me&mdash;it was the first time you had failed to answer our old
call. There seemed nothing to do but forget you&mdash;if I could. I
never succeeded, but I thought I did&mdash;except when I looked at
Vega of the Lyre. And I was lonely. Ilse was a good pal. Besides, I
think I thought I could talk to her about you&mdash;keep a little
corner in your life as the husband of some one you loved. I knew
Ilse didn't care much for me&mdash;I was only the consolation
prize. But I thought we could jog along very well together and help
each other keep away the fearful lonesomeness of the world. And
then"&mdash;Teddy laughed at himself&mdash;"when she 'left me at
the altar' according to the very formula of Bertha M. Clay I was
furious. She had made such a fool of me&mdash;me, who fancied I was
beginning to cut quite a figure in the world. My word, how I hated
women for awhile! And I was hurt, too. I had got very fond of
Ilse&mdash;I really did love her&mdash;in a way."</p>

<p>"In a way." Emily felt no jealousy of that.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>"I don't know as I'd take Ilse's leavings," remarked Aunt
Elizabeth.</p>

<p>Emily flashed on Aunt Elizabeth one of her old starry looks.</p>

<p>"Ilse's leavings. Why, Teddy has always belonged to me and I to
him. Heart, soul and body," said Emily.</p>

<p>Aunt Elizabeth shuddered. One ought to feel these
things&mdash;perhaps&mdash;but it was indecent to say them.</p>

<p>"Always sly," was Aunt Ruth's comment.</p>

<p>"She'd better marry him right off before she changes her mind
<i>again,"</i> said Aunt Addie.</p>

<p>"I suppose she won't wipe <i>his</i> kisses off," said Uncle
Wallace.</p>

<p>Yet, on the whole, the clan were pleased. Much pleased. After
all their anxieties over Emily's love affairs, to see her "settled"
so respectably with a "boy" well known to them, who had, so far as
they knew at least, no bad habits and no disgraceful antecedents.
And who was doing pretty well in the business of picture-painting.
They would not exactly say so, but Old Kelly said it for them.</p>

<p>"Ah, now, that's something like," said Old Kelly
approvingly.</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>Dean wrote a little while before the quiet bridal at New Moon. A
fat letter with an enclosure&mdash;a deed to the Disappointed House
and all it contained.</p>

<p>"I want you to take this, Star, as my wedding-gift. That house
must not be disappointed again. I want it to live at last. You and
Teddy can make use of it as a summer home. And some day I will come
to see you in it. I claim my old corner in your house of friendship
now and then."</p>

<p>"How very&mdash;dear&mdash;of Dean. And I am so glad&mdash;he is
not hurt any longer."</p>

<p>She was standing where the To-morrow Road opened out on the
Blair Water valley. Behind her she heard Teddy's eager footsteps
coming to <i>her.</i> Before her on the dark hill, against the
sunset, was the little beloved grey house that was to be
disappointed no longer.</p>
