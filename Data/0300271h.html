<h2><a name="chap1" id="chap1">I. &mdash; GERONIMO GOES OUT</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">THE silver light of Klego-na-ay, the full moon,
shone down from out the star-lit heavens of an Arizona night upon
the camp of the Be-don-ko-he Apaches; shone upon sleek copper
shoulders; shone upon high cheek bones; softened the cruel lines of
swart, savage faces&mdash;faces as inscrutable as is the face of
Klego-na-ay herself.</p>

<p>Shone the silver moonlight upon Nan-ta-do-tash, the izze-nantan
of his people, as he led them in the dance, as he prayed for rain
to save their parched crops. As he danced, Nan-ta-do-tash twirled
his tzi-ditinidi about his head, twirled it rapidly from front to
rear, producing the sound of a gust of rain-laden wind; and the
warriors and the women, dancing with Nan-ta-do-tash, listened to
the tzi-ditinidi, saw the medicine man cast hoddentin to the four
winds, and knew that these things would compel the wind and the
rain to come to the aid of their crops.</p>

<p>A little to one side, watching the dancers, sat Shoz-Dijiji, the
Black Bear, with Gian-nah-tah, friend of boyhood days, companion of
the war trail and the raid. Little more than a youth was
Shoz-Dijiji, yet already a war chief of the Be-don-ko-he, proven in
many battles with the soldiers of the pindah-lickoyee; terror of
many a scattered hacienda of Sonora and Chihuahua&mdash;the dread
Apache Devil.</p>

<p>The old men beat upon the es-a-da-ded, the primitive drum of
buckskin stretched across a hoop; and to their cadence
Nan-ta-do-tash led the dancers, his naked body painted a greenish
brown with a yellow snake upon each arm; upon his breast, in
yellow, a bear; and upon his back the zig-zag lines of
lightning.</p>

<p>His sacred izze-kloth, passing across his right shoulder, fell
over his left hip. Of a potency almost equal to this four-strand
medicine cord of twisted antelope skin was the buckskin medicine
hat of Nan-ta-do-tash by means of which he was able to peer into
the future, to foresee the approach of an enemy, cure the sick, or
tell who had stolen ponies from other people.</p>

<p>The downy feathers and black-tipped plumes of the eagle added to
the efficacy and decoration of this potent head-dress, the value of
which was further enhanced by pieces of abalone shell, by duklij,
and a snake's rattle which surmounted the apex, while in brownish
yellow and dirty blue there were depicted upon the body of the hat
clouds, a rainbow, hail, the morning star, the God of Wind, with
his lungs, the black Kan, and the great suns.</p>

<p>"You do not dance with the warriors and the women, Shoz-Dijiji,"
said Gian-nah-tah. "Why is it?"</p>

<p>"Why should I?" demanded the Black Bear. "Usen has forsaken the
Shis-Inday. No longer does He hear the prayers of His people. He
has gone over to the side of the pindah-lickoyee, who have more
warriors and better weapons.</p>

<p>"Many times went Shoz-Dijiji to the high places and made big
medicine and prayed to Usen; but He let Juh steal my little
Ish-kay-nay, and He let the bullet of the pindah-lickoyee slay her.
Why should I dance to the Kans if they are blind and deaf?"</p>

<p>"But did not Usen help you to find Juh and slay him?" urged
Gian-nah-tah.</p>

<p>"Usen!" The tone of the Black Bear was contemptuous. "No one
helped Shoz-Dijiji find Juh. No one helped Shoz-Dijiji slay him.
Alone he found Juh&mdash;alone, with his own hands, he killed him.
It was Shoz-Dijiji, not Usen, who avenged Ish-kay-nay."</p>

<p>"But Usen healed the wound of your sorrow," persisted
Gian-nah-tah. "He placed in your heart a new love to take the place
of the old that was become but a sad memory."</p>

<p>"If Usen did that it was but to add to the sorrows of
Shoz-Dijiji," said the Black Bear. "I have not told you,
Gian-nah-tah."</p>

<p>"You have not spoken of the white girl since you took her from
our camp to her home after you had saved her from Tats-ah-das-ay-go
and the other Chi-e-a-hen," replied Gian-nah-tah; "but while she
was with us I saw the look in your eyes, Shoz-Dijiji, and it told
me what your lips did not tell me."</p>

<p>"Then my eyes must have known what my heart did not know," said
Shoz-Dijiji. "It would have been better had my heart not learned,
but it did.</p>

<p>"Long time have we been friends, Gian-nah-tah. Our tsochs,
swinging from the branches of the trees, swayed to the same
breezes, or, bound to the backs of our mothers, we followed the
same trails across deserts and mountains; together we learned to
use the bow and the arrow and the lance; and together we went upon
the war trail the first time. To me you are as a brother. You will
not laugh at me, Gian-nah-tah; and so I shall tell you what
happened that time that I took the white-eyed girl, Wichita, back
to the hogan of her father that you may know why I am unhappy and
why I know that Usen no longer cares what becomes of me."</p>

<p>"Gian-nah-tah does not laugh at the sorrow of his best friend,"
said the other.</p>

<p>"It was not in my heart to love the white-eyed girl," continued
the Black Bear. "To Shoz-Dijiji she was as a sister. She was kind
to me. When the soldiers of the pindah-lickoyee were all about, she
brought me food and water and gave me a horse to carry me back to
my people. I knew that she did that because I had once saved her
from a white-eyed man who would have harmed her. No thought of love
was in my mind. How could it have been? How could I think that
Shoz-Dijiji, an Apache, a war chief of the Be-don-ko-he, could love
a girl of the pindah-lickoyee!</p>

<p>"But Usen deserted me. He let me look upon the face of the
white-eyed girl for many days, and every day He made her more
beautiful in my eyes. I tried not to think of love. I put it from
my mind. I turned my thoughts to other things, but I could not keep
my eyes from the face of the pindah-lickoyee girl.</p>

<p>"At last we came close to the hogan of her father; and there I
stopped and told her to go on, but she wanted me to come with her
that her father might thank me. I would not go. I dared not go. I,
The Apache Devil, was afraid of this white-eyed daughter of the
pindah-lickoyee!</p>

<p>"She came close to me and urged me. She laid her two hands upon
my breast. The touch of those soft, white hands, Gian-nah-tah, was
more powerful than the will of Shoz-Dijiji; beneath it crumbled all
the pride and hate that are of the heritage of the Apaches. A flame
burst forth within me&mdash;the signal fire of love.</p>

<p>"I seized her and pressed her close; I put my mouth upon her
mouth. And then she struck at me and tried to push me away, and I
saw fear in her eyes; and something more terrible than
fear&mdash;loathing&mdash;as though I were unclean.</p>

<p>"Then I let her go; and I came away, but I left my heart and
happiness behind. Shoz-Dijiji has left to him only his pride and
his hate&mdash;his hate of the pindah-lickoyee."</p>

<p>"If you hate the white-eyed girl now, it is well," said
Gian-nah-tah. "The pindah-lickoyee are low born and fools. They are
not fit for an Apache!"</p>

<p>"I do not hate the white-eyed girl, Wichita," said Shoz-Dijiji,
sadly. "If I did I should not be unhappy. I love her."</p>

<p>Gian-nah-tah shook his head. "There are many pretty girls of the
Shis-Inday," he said presently, "who look with bright eyes upon
Shoz-Dijiji."</p>

<p>"I do not love them," replied the Black Bear. "Let us talk no
more of these things. Gian-nah-tah is my friend. I have spoken. Let
us go and listen to the talk of Geronimo and the other old
warriors."</p>

<p>"That is better talk for men," agreed Gian-nah-tah.</p>

<p>Together they strolled over and joined the group of warriors
that surrounded the old war chief of the Apaches. White Horse,
Geronimo's brother, was speaking.</p>

<p>"There is much talk," he said, "among the Indians at San Carlos
that the chiefs of the white-eyed soldiers are going to put
Geronimo and many other of our leaders in prison."</p>

<p>"They put me in prison once before and kept me there for four
months," said Geronimo. "They never told me why they kept me there
or why they let me out."</p>

<p>"They put you in prison to kill you as they did Mangas
Colorado," said Na-tanh; "but their hearts turned to water, so that
they were afraid."</p>

<p>"They will never get Geronimo in prison again," said the old war
chief. "I am getting old; and I should like to have peace, but
rather would I take the war trail for the rest of my life than be
again chained in the prison of the pindah-lickoyee.</p>

<p>"We do not want to fight any more. We came in as
Nan-tan-des-la-par-en
("Captain-with-the-brown-clothes"&mdash;Major-General George Crook,
U.S.A.)asked us to. We planted crops, but the rain will not come.
Usen is angry with us; and The Great White Chief cannot feed us
because his Agent steals the beef that is meant for us, and lets us
starve. He will not let us hunt for food if we live at San
Carlos."</p>

<p>"Who is this white-eyed chief that he may say where an Apache
warrior may make his kunh-gan-hay or where he shall hunt?" demanded
Shoz-Dijiji. "The Black Bear makes his camp where he will, hunts
where he will!"</p>

<p>"Those are the big words of a young man, my son," said Geronimo.
"It is fine to make big talk; but when we would do these things the
soldiers come and kill us; every white-eyed man who meets our
hunters upon the trails shoots at them. To them we are as coyotes.
Not content with stealing the land that Usen gave to our
forefathers, not content with slaughtering the game that Usen put
here to feed us, they lie to us, they cheat us, they hunt us down
like wild beasts."</p>

<p>"And yet you, Geronimo, War Chief of the Apaches, hesitate to
take the war trail against them!" Shoz-Dijiji reproached him. "It
is not because you are afraid. No man may say that Geronimo is
afraid. Then why is it?"</p>

<p>"The son of Geronimo speaks true words," replied the old chief.
"Go-yat-thlay (Geronimo), the son of Tah-clish-un, is not afraid to
take the war trail against the pindah-lickoyee even though he knows
that it is hopeless to fight against their soldiers, who are as
many as the needles upon the cedars, because Go-yat-thlay is not
afraid to die; but he does not like to see the warriors and the
women and the children slain needlessly, and so he waits and
hopes&mdash;hopes that the pindah-lickoyee will some day keep the
words of the treaties they have made with the Shis-Inday&mdash;the
treaties that they have always been the first to break.</p>

<p>"If that day should come, the Shis-Inday could live in peace
with the pindah-lickoyee; our women and children would have food to
eat; we should have land to till and land to hunt upon; we might
live as brothers with the white-eyed men, nor ever again go upon
the war trail."</p>

<p>"I do not wish to live with the white-eyed men in peace or
otherwise," cried the Black Bear. "I am an Apache! I was born to
the war trail. From my mother's breasts I drew the strong milk that
makes warriors. You, my father, taught me to string a bow, to hurl
a lance; from your lips my childish ears heard the proud deeds of
my ancestors, the great warriors from whose loins I sprung; you
taught me to hate the pindah-lickoyee, you saw me take my first
scalp, you have seen me kill many of the warriors of the enemy, and
always you approved and were proud. How then may I believe that the
words you have just spoken are true words from your heart?"</p>

<p>"Youth speaks from the heart, Shoz-Dijiji, as you speak and as I
spoke to you when you were a child; but old age speaks from the
head. My heart would go upon the war trail, my son; my heart would
kill the white-eyed men wherever it found them, but my head tells
me to suffer and be sad a little longer in the hope of peace and
justice for my people."</p>

<p>For a time after Geronimo had spoken there was silence, broken
only by the beating of the es-a-da-ded and the mumbling of the
medicine man, as he led the dancers. Presently a figure stepped
into the outer rim of the circle of firelight from the darkness
beyond and halted. He gave the sign and spoke the words of peace,
and at the command of Geronimo approached the group of squatting
braves.</p>

<p>It was Klo-sen, the Ned-ni. He came and stood before the
Be-don-ko-he warriors and looked into the face of Geronimo.</p>

<p>"I bring word from the white-eyed chiefs at San Carlos," he
said.</p>

<p>"What message do they send?" asked Geronimo.</p>

<p>"They wish Geronimo and the other chiefs to come to Fort Thomas
and hold a council with them," replied Klo-sen.</p>

<p>"Of what matters would they speak?" demanded the old war
chief.</p>

<p>"There are many things of which they wish to speak to the chiefs
of the Apaches," replied Klo-sen. "They have heard that we are
dissatisfied, and they have promised to listen to our troubles.
They say that they want to live in peace with us, and that if we
come, they will have a great feast for us, and that together we
shall plan how the white-eyes and the Shis-Inday may live together
like brothers."</p>

<p>Shoz-Dijiji grunted skeptically.</p>

<p>"They want to make reservation Indians of us forever," said a
warrior.</p>

<p>"Tell them we shall hold a council here and send word to them,"
said Geronimo.</p>

<p>"If you do not come," said Klo-sen, "neither will the
Ned-ni&mdash;this word De-klu-gie sends to Geronimo and the
Be-don-ko-he."</p>

<p>With the coming of the messenger the dance had stopped and the
warriors had gathered to listen to his words, forming naturally and
in accordance with their rank in a circle about a small fire, so
that they were all present when Geronimo suggested that they hold a
council to determine what action they should take; and as Chief of
the Be-don-ko-he he was the first to speak. "We, the Shis-Inday,
are vanishing from the earth," he said sadly, "yet I cannot think
we are useless, or Usen would not have created us. He created all
tribes of men, and certainly had a righteous purpose in creating
each.</p>

<p>"For each tribe of men Usen created He also made a home. In the
land created for any particular tribe He placed whatever would be
best for that particular tribe.</p>

<p>"When Usen created the Apaches, He also created their homes in
the mountains and the valleys of New Mexico, Arizona, Sonora, and
Chihuahua. He gave to them such grain, fruits, and game as they
needed to eat. To restore their health when disease attacked them,
He made many different herbs to grow. He taught them where to find
these herbs and how to prepare them for medicine. He gave them a
pleasant climate, and all they needed for clothing and shelter was
at hand.</p>

<p>"Usen created, also, the white-eyed men; and for them He created
a country where they could live; but they are not satisfied. They
want the country that Usen created for them and also the country
that He created for the Apaches. They wish to live in the way that
Usen intended that they should live, but they are not satisfied
that the Apaches should live as Usen wished them to. They want the
Apaches to live as the white-eyes live.</p>

<p>"The Apaches cannot live as the white-eyed men live. They would
not be happy. They would sicken and die. They must have freedom to
roam where they will in their own country; they must be able to
obtain the food to which they are accustomed; they must have
freedom to search for the herbs that will cure them of
sickness.</p>

<p>"These things they cannot do if they live upon the reservations
set aside by the white-eyed men for them. They cannot live their
own lives if their chiefs must take orders from an Indian Agent who
knows little about Indians and cares less.</p>

<p>"As I grow older my mind turns more to peace than to the war
trail. I do not wish to fight the pindah-lickoyee, but neither do I
wish to be told by the pindah-lickoyee how and where I shall l live
in my own country." The old man paused and looked around the circle
of savage faces.</p>

<p>"I want peace. Perhaps there are wiser men sitting about this
council fire who can tell me how the Shis-Inday may have both peace
and freedom. Perhaps if we go to this council with the white-eyes
they may tell us how we may have peace with freedom.</p>

<p>"Geronimo would like to go; but always there is in his mind the
recollection of that day, long ago, when the chiefs of the
white-eyed soldiers invited the Be-don-ko-he to a council and a
feast at Apache Pass. Mangas Colorado was Chief then, and he went
with many of his warriors.</p>

<p>"Just before noon the soldiers invited the Be-don-ko-he into a
tent where, they were told, they would be given food to eat. When
they were all in the tent the soldiers attacked them. Mangas
Colorado and several other warriors, by cutting through the tent,
escaped; but most of them were killed or captured.</p>

<p>"I have spoken."</p>

<p>A warrior at Geronimo's right hand arose. "I, too, want peace,"
he said, "but I hear the spirit voices of Sanza, Kla-de-ta-he,
Ni-yo-ka-he, Gopi, and the other warriors who were killed that day
by the soldiers at Apache Pass. They tell me not to trust the
white-eyed men. The spirit of Kla-de-ta-he, my father, reminds me
that the white-eyed men are all liars and thieves. This they have
proved to us many times. They make treaties and break them; they
steal the beef and the other provisions that are intended for us.
That, all men know. I do not think that we should go to this
council. I have spoken."</p>

<p>Thus, one after the other, all who wished to speak spoke, some
for and some against attending the council; and when the final vote
was taken the majority had spoken against it.</p>

<p>That same night Klo-sen left to carry the word back to the white
men and to De-klu-gie, chief of the Ned-ni, and also to De-klu-gie
an invitation to him and his people to join the Be-don-ko-he on a
hunting trip into Mexico.</p>

<p>"You know," said Geronimo to his warriors, "that this will mean
war! The white-eyed ones will not permit us to leave the
reservation and hunt in peace."</p>

<p>"It is more manly to die on the warpath than to be killed in
prison," replied Shoz-Dijiji.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>Two days later the Ned-ni Apaches joined the Be-don-ko-he, and
that all felt that their contemplated move meant war was evidenced
by their hurried preparations for departure and for the war trail.
Disordered hair was shampooed with tallow and slicked down; war
bands were adjusted; smaller, lighter ear-rings replaced the heavy
pendants of peace times; necklaces were discarded down to a single
strand; many a bronze forefinger was stained with color as each
brave laid on the war paint in accordance with his individual
taste, ability, and imagination.</p>

<p>The squaws, with awl and deer sinew, sewed the final patches to
worn war moccasins, gathered together their few belongings,
prepared for the grueling marches, the days of hunger, of thirst,
of battle.</p>

<p>From many an eminence, eagle eyed, scouts watched the approaches
to the camp. In advance of these, other scouts ranged far in the
direction from which troops might be expected to advance. These
scouts knew the hour at which the Be-don-ko-hes and Ned-nis would
start their southward march toward Sonora; and, as the main body of
the Apaches broke camp and moved out along the selected route, the
scouts fell slowly back; but always they watched toward the north,
and the eyes of the marching tribes were turned often in the same
direction. So it was that, shortly after they had left camp, the
Indians saw little puffs of smoke arising in quick succession from
the summit of a mountain range far to the north. Those rapidly
multiplied and repeated puffs of smoke told them that a large, well
armed, enemy party was approaching; but it was still a long way
off, and Geronimo had little fear that it could overtake him. On
they moved, well armed, well mounted, secure in the belief that all
the white-eyed soldiers lay to the north of them. Shoz-Dijiji,
astride his pinto stallion, Nejeunee, rode in advance leading the
way toward Apache Pass. Suddenly from a hill top close to the pass
they were approaching a column of smoke rose into the air&mdash;it
broke into a puff&mdash;was followed by another and another in
quick succession. Another body of the enemy was approaching Apache
Pass from the opposite side! Shoz-Dijiji reined about and raced
Nejeunee back to Geronimo who, with the balance of the Apaches, had
already seen the smoke signal.</p>

<p>"Take ten warriors and ride through the pass," instructed
Geronimo. "If the pindah-lickoyee are too close to permit us to get
through send one back with the word, and we will turn south through
the mountains on this side of the pass. With the other warriors you
will hold them as long as you can&mdash;until dark if
possible&mdash;and then follow us. With stones we will tell you
which way we have gone.</p>

<p>"If they are not already too close, advance until you find a
good place to hold them. That will give us time to get through the
pass and past them on the trail toward Sonora. Go!"</p>

<p>Shoz-Dijiji asked Gian-nah-tah and nine other braves if they
wished to accompany him; and turned and raced off toward Apache
Pass without waiting for a reply, for he knew that they would all
follow him. He had little fear of meeting the soldiers unexpectedly
in the pass, for he knew that the scout who had sent up the smoke
signal would never cease to watch the enemy and that he would fall
back before them, keeping always between the soldiers and the
Apaches.</p>

<p>Shoz-Dijiji and his ten reached the far end of the pass. There
were no soldiers in sight yet; but a half mile to the west they saw
their scout signalling them to hasten forward, and when they
reached him he took Shoz-Dijiji to the hill top and pointed toward
the south.</p>

<p>Half a mile away Shoz-Dijiji saw three troopers in dusty blue
riding slowly in the direction of the pass. They were the point.
Behind them, but hidden by an intervening hill, was the main body,
its position well marked by the dust cloud hovering above it. That
the soldiers had seen the smoke signal was apparent by the extreme
caution with which the point advanced. Now a small advance party
came into view with flankers well out, but Shoz-Dijiji did not wait
to see more&mdash;the warriors of the pindah-lickoyee were coming,
and they were prepared. The young War Chief of the Be-don-ko-he had
fought against the soldiers of the white-eyed men before and he
knew what they would do when attacked. He thought that he could
hold them long enough for the main body of the Apaches to get
through the pass and so he sent one messenger racing back to urge
Geronimo to hasten; he sent a warrior to the hilltop to fire upon
the point, and he sent two warriors with all the ponies upon the
new trail toward the south that the tribes would now have to
follow. Thus he burned his bridges behind him, but he was confident
of the result of his plan. Counting himself, there were now nine
warriors opposing the enemy; and Shoz-Dijiji lost no time in
disposing his little force to carry out the strategy of his defense
of Apache Pass. The point, having uncovered the enemy, did what
Shoz-Dijiji had known that it would do&mdash;turned and raced back
toward the advance party, which now deployed. The main body halted
and was dismounted to fight on foot, the terrain not justifying
mounted action.</p>

<p>This delay, which Shoz-Dijiji had counted on, was utilized by
him and six of his warriors in racing through the hills, just out
of sight of the enemy, toward a point where they could overlook the
main body. Two warriors he left upon the hilltop that commanded the
approach to the pass.</p>

<p>When the seven painted warriors reached their stations they were
spread along the low hills looking down upon the enemy and at
intervals of about fifty yards. Shoz-Dijiji was farthest from the
pass. It was his rifle that spoke first from above and behind the
troopers holding the horses of those who were now slowly advancing
in skirmish line on foot. A struck horse screamed and lunged,
breaking away from the trooper that held it. Along the line of
hills now the seven rifles were cracking rapidly down upon the
unprotected rear and flank of the enemy. Riderless horses, breaking
away from those who held them, ran, snorting, among the dismounted
troopers, adding to the confusion. The commanding officer,
steadying his men by word and example, ordered them to seek shelter
and lie down, forming them in a ragged line facing the hills. A
lieutenant directed the removal of the remaining horses to a place
of safety.</p>

<p>The Apaches did not fire again after the first few disconcerting
rounds. Shoz-Dijiji had no wish to precipitate a charge that might
reveal his weakness, his sole aim being to delay the advance of the
enemy toward the pass until Geronimo should have come through with
the two tribes.</p>

<p>The officer commanding the cavalry had no means of knowing that
he was not faced by the entire strength of the renegades; and in
the lull that followed the first attack he started withdrawing his
men to a safer position, and as this withdrawal took them away from
the pass Shoz-Dijiji made no effort to embarrass it but waited
until the troopers had found shelter. He watched them dig little
trenches for their bodies and pile rocks in front of their heads;
and when he was sure that they felt more secure, he passed the word
along his line to fire an occasional shot and that after each shot
the warrior should change his position before he fired again that
an impression might be given the enemy that it faced a long line of
warriors.</p>

<p>The soldiers had formed their line some hundred yards from where
their horses were hidden in a dry wash; and at every effort that
was made to cross this space and reach the horses the Apaches
concentrated their fire upon this zone, effectually discouraging
any considerable enthusiasm in the project, since as long as they
remained passive there were no casualties.</p>

<p>The commanding officer was mystified by the tactics of the
Apaches. He hoped they were preparing to charge, and in that hope
he hesitated to order his own men up the steep hillside in the face
of the fire of an unknown number of savages. Then, too, he could
afford to wait, as he was suffering no losses and was momentarily
expecting the arrival of the infantry that was following with the
baggage train.</p>

<p>And so the afternoon wore on. A messenger came to Shoz-Dijiji
with word that the two tribes had passed safely through the pass.
Shoz-Dijiji fired a shot at the line of dusty blue and sent two of
his warriors to join the main body of the Apaches. During the
following half hour each of the remaining braves fired once, and
then two more left to overtake the renegades. The next half hour
was a busy one for the three remaining warriors as each fired two
or three rounds, changing his position after each shot and thus
giving the impression of undiminished strength. Then two more
warriors retired.</p>

<p>Now only Shoz-Dijiji remained. In the north rose a great dust
cloud that drew constantly nearer. The infantry was coming.</p>

<p>Shoz-Dijiji fired and scuttled to a new position nearer Apache
Pass. The troopers peppered away at the spot from which the smoke
of his shot had arisen, as they had all the long hot afternoon.
Shoz-Dijiji fired again and moved on.</p>

<p>The infantry was met by a messenger from the cavalry. All
afternoon they had heard the firing and had hastened forward. Hot,
dusty, tired, they were in bad humor.</p>

<p>Spitting dust from swollen tongues, they cursed all Indians in
general and Apaches in particular as they deployed and started up
the hillside to flank the embattled reds. This time, by God, they
would get old Geronimo and all his dirty, sneaking Siwashes!</p>

<p>Simultaneously the dismounted troopers charged straight into the
face of the enemy. Fat chance the doughboys had of beating them to
it!</p>

<p>It was a race now to see which would reach the renegades
first&mdash;cavalry or infantry. The cavalry, having the advantage
of propinquity, arrived first, and they got something,
too&mdash;when the infantry arrived they got the laugh. There was
not an Indian insight!</p>

<p>From a hilltop a mile to the south of them a lone warrior
watched them, estimating the numbers of the infantry, the size of
the wagon train. Satisfied, he turned and trotted along the trail
made by his fellows as they moved southward.</p>

<p>Down into Sonora the long trail was leading, down to a camp in
the Sierra de Sahuaripa mountains.</p>

<p>Geronimo had gone out again!</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="chap2" id="chap2">II. &mdash; SPOILS OF WAR</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">THE camp of Be-don-ko-he and Ned-ni Apaches lay in
the Sierra de Sahuaripa not far from Casa Grande, but the
activities of the renegades led them far afield in both Sonora and
Chihuahua during the ensuing year.</p>

<p>Shoz-Dijiji, restless, unhappy, filled with bitterness against
all men who were not Apaches, often brooding over the wrongs and
injustices inflicted upon his people, became a living scourge
throughout the countryside.</p>

<p>Sometimes alone, again with Gian-nah-tah and other young braves,
he raided shops and ranches and isolated cottages, or waylaid
travellers upon the road.</p>

<p>He affected a design in face painting that was distinctive and
personal; so that all who saw him knew him, even though they never
had seen him before. He laid a broad band of white from temple to
temple across his eyes&mdash;the remainder of his face, above and
below the band, was blue.</p>

<p>Entering a small village alone, he would step into the little
tienda and stand silently upon the threshold for a moment watching
the effect of his presence upon the shop keeper and his customers.
He derived pleasure from seeing the pallor of fear overspread their
faces and hearing their mumbled prayers; he loved the terror in
their voices as they voiced his name, "The Apache Devil!"</p>

<p>If they ran he let them go, but if they offered resistance he
shot them down; then he took what he wanted and left. He did not
kill women or children, nor did he ever mutilate the dead or
torture the living; but others did&mdash;Apaches, Indians of other
tribes, Mexicans&mdash;and The Apache Devil was held responsible
for every outrage that left no eye-witness living to refute the
charge.</p>

<p>In the year that they remained in Mexico the Apaches collected a
considerable herd of horses and cattle by similar means and
according to the same ethics that govern civilized troops in an
enemy's country. They considered themselves at war with all
mankind, nor was there any sufficient reason why they should feel
otherwise. For over three hundred years they had been at war with
the white men; for over three hundred years they had been
endeavoring to expel the invader from their domain. In the history
of the world no more courageous defense of a fatherland against
overwhelming odds is recorded, but the only accolade that history
will bestow upon them is that which ratifies the titles, thieves
and murderers, conferred upon them by those who ravished their land
for profit.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>It was late summer. The growing herd of the Apaches was becoming
unwieldy. Scouts and raiding parties were almost daily reporting to
Geronimo the increasing activities of Mexican troops, proof to the
old War Chief that the Mexican government was inaugurating a
determined campaign against him, which he realized must assuredly
result in the eventual loss of their hard-earned flocks, since the
tactics of Apache warfare depend, for success, chiefly upon the
marvelous mobility of the savages. From the summit of a mountain in
the Sierra de Sahuaripa range rose a tall, thin column of smoke. It
scarcely wavered in the still air of early morning. Fed by trained
hands, its volume remained almost constant and without break. From
a distance it appeared a white pillar topped by a white cloud that
drifted, at last, lazily toward the north. Fifty, a hundred miles
away keen eyes might see it through the thin, clear air of Sonora.
Caballero and peon in little villages, in scattered huts, in many a
distant hacienda saw it and, cursing, looked to their weapons,
prepared the better to guard their flocks and their women, for it
told them that the Apaches were gathering; and when the Apaches
gathered, let honest folk beware!</p>

<p>Other eyes saw it, savage eyes, the eyes for which its message
was intended; and from plain and mountain painted warriors,
scouting, raiding, turned their ponies' heads toward the soft,
white beacon; and thus the scattered members of the Be-don-ko-he
and the Ned-ni joined forces in the Sierra de Sahuaripa and started
north with the spoils of war safely ahead of the converging
troops.</p>

<p>"For more than a year," Geronimo had said to them during the
council in which they had determined to leave Mexico, "we have been
absent from the country of the pindah-lickoyee. In all this time we
have not struck a blow against them. We have shown them that we are
not at war with them but with the Mexicans. Let us return with our
herds to our own country and settle down in peace. With what we
have won we can increase our cattle and our horses to such an
extent that we shall not have to go upon the war trail again for a
long time possibly never again. Thus we can live in peace beside
the pindah-lickoyee. Let us not strike again at them. If our young
men must go upon the war trail, there is always Mexico. The
Mexicans are our natural enemies. They were our enemies before the
pindah-lickoyee came; I do not forget Kas-ki-yeh, where my wife, my
mother, and my children were treacherously slain. Let not the young
warriors forget Kas-ki-yeh either! Many were the women and the
children and the warriors killed there that day while most of the
fighting braves were peaceably trading in the nearby village.</p>

<p>"Perhaps now that we have obtained the means to guard against
hunger we may live in peace in our own country with the white-eyed
men. I have made big medicine and prayed to Usen that this thing
may be. I am tired of fighting. I am tired of seeing my people
killed in the hopeless struggle against the white-eyes."</p>

<p>And so the two tribes came back to the reservation at San
Carlos, bringing their great herd with them, and there was feasting
and dancing and much tizwin was consumed.</p>

<p>The White Mountain Apaches, who had not gone out with Geronimo,
profited however, for they had furnished many of the rifles and
much of the ammunition that had aided in the success of the
renegades; and they received their reward in the division of the
spoils of war.</p>

<p>After the freedom and excitement of the war trail it was
difficult for the young braves to settle down to the monotony of
reservation life. Herding cattle and horses was far from a
thrilling occupation and offered little outlet for active, savage
spirits; and it could as well be done by boys as by men.</p>

<p>The result was that they spent much time in gambling and
drinking, which more often than not led to quarreling. Shoz-Dijiji
suffered in a way, perhaps, more than the majority, for his was
naturally a restless spirit which had not even the outlet afforded
by strong drink, since Shoz-Dijiji cared nothing for this form of
dissipation. Nausea and headaches did not appeal to him as
particularly desirable or profitable. He found a certain thrill in
gambling but most of all he enjoyed contests of skill and
endurance. He challenged other braves to wrestle, jump, or run. The
stakes were ornaments, ammunition, weapons, ponies, but as
Shoz-Dijiji always won it was not long before he was unable to find
an antagonist willing to risk a wager against him.</p>

<p>Perhaps his chief diversion was pony racing and many a round of
ammunition, many a necklace of glass beads, magical berries, and
roots, bits of the valued duklij came into his possession because
of the speed of Nejeunee and other swift ponies of his string.</p>

<p>Shoz-Dijiji, gauged by the standards of Apachedom, was wealthy.
He possessed a large herd, fine raiment, the best of weapons and
"jewelry" that was the envy of all. Many a scheming mother and
lovelorn maiden set a cap for him, but the Black Bear was proof
against all their wiles.</p>

<p>Sometimes his father, Geronimo, or his mother, Sons-ee-ah-ray,
reproached him, telling him that it was not fitting that a rich and
powerful war chief should be without women to wait upon him. They
told him that it was a reflection on them; but Shoz-Dijiji only
shrugged his shoulders and grunted, saying that he did not want to
be bothered with women and children. Only Shoz-Dijiji and
Gian-nah-tah knew the truth.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>Just off the reservation was a place known locally as the Hog
Ranch, though the only swine that frequented it were human; and
while a single member of the family Suidae would have tended to
elevate its standing in the community it was innocent of even this
slight claim to decency.</p>

<p>Its proprietor was what is still known in the vernacular of the
Southwest as a tinhorn. "Dirty" Cheetim had tried prospecting and
horse stealing but either of these vocations were dependent for
success upon a more considerable proportion of courage and
endurance than existed in his mental and physical endowment.</p>

<p>His profits were derived through the exploitation of the
pulchritude of several blondined ladies from the States and about
an equal number of dusky se&ntilde;oritas from below the border,
from cheating drunken soldiers and cowboys at cards, from selling
cheap, adulterated whiskey to his white patrons openly and to
Indians surreptitiously. It was whispered that he had other sources
of revenue which Washington might have found interesting had it
been in any measure interested in the welfare of the Indians, but
how can one expect overworked Christian congressmen to neglect
their electorate in the interests of benighted savages who have no
votes?</p>

<p>However; it seemed strange to those who gave it any thought that
such a place as "Dirty" Cheetim's Hog Ranch should receive even the
passive countenance of the Indian Agent.</p>

<p>Tall and straight, silently on moccasined feet, an Apache brave
stepped through the doorway of the Hog Ranch. Pausing within he let
his quick, keen glance pass rapidly over the faces of the inmates.
The place was almost deserted at this hour of the day. Two
Mexicans, an American cowboy, and a soldier were playing stud at a
table in one corner of the room. Two other soldiers and two girls
were standing at the bar, behind which one of "Dirty" Cheetim's
assistants was officiating. One of the soldiers turned and looked
at the Indian.</p>

<p>"Hello! Black Bear!" he called. "Have a drink?"</p>

<p>Shoz-Dijiji looked steadily at the soldier for a moment before
replying.</p>

<p>"No sabe!" he said, presently, his eyes moving to a closed door
that led to a back room.</p>

<p>"He's a damn liar!" said the soldier. "I'll bet he savvies
English as good as me."</p>

<p>"Gee!" exclaimed one of the girls; "he's sure a good lookin'
Siwash." She looked up into Shoz-Dijiji's face and smiled boldly as
he approached them on his way across the room toward the closed
door; but the face of the Indian remained expressionless,
inscrutable.</p>

<p>"They don't none of 'em look good to me," said the other
soldier. "This guy was out with Geronimo, and every time I lamp one
of their mugs I think maybe it's The Apache Devil. You can't never
tell."</p>

<p>The first soldier took hold of Shoz-Dijiji's arm as he was
passing and stopped him; then from the bar he picked up a glass
filled with whiskey and offered it to the Apache. Shoz-Dijiji
grunted, shook his head and passed on. The girl laughed.</p>

<p>"I reckon he's got more sense than we have," she said; "he knows
enough not to drink 'Dirty's' rot-gut."</p>

<p>"You must be stuck on the Siwash, Goldie," accused the first
soldier.</p>

<p>"I might have a mash on a lot o' worse lookin' hombres than
him," she shot back, with a toss of her faded, golden curls.</p>

<p>Shoz-Dijiji heard and understood the entire conversation. He had
not for nothing spent the months of Geronimo's imprisonment at San
Carlos in the post school, but not even by the quiver of an eye-lid
did he acknowledge that he understood.</p>

<p>At the closed door, unembarrassed by the restrictions of an
etiquette that he would have ignored had he been cognizant of it,
he turned the knob and stepped into the room beyond without
knocking.</p>

<p>Two men were there&mdash;a white man and an Indian. They both
looked up as Shoz-Dijiji entered. This was the first time that
Shoz-Dijiji had been in "Dirty" Cheetim's Hog Ranch. It was the
first time that he had seen the proprietor or known who "Dirty"
Cheetim was; but he had met him before, and he recognized him
immediately.</p>

<p>Instantly there was projected upon the screen of memory a sun
scorched canyon, boulder strewn, through which wound a dusty wagon
road. At the summit of the canyon's western wall a young Apache
brave crouched hidden beneath a grey blanket that, from the
canyon's bottom, looked but another boulder. He was watching for
the coming of the soldiers of the pindah-lickoyee that he might
carry the word of it back to Geronimo.</p>

<p>Presently three bearded men rode into view. The Apache gazed
down upon them with contempt. His fingers, resting upon his rifle,
twitched; but he was scouting and must forego this Usen-given
opportunity. The men were not soldiers; so they were of no concern
to Shoz-Dijiji, the scout.</p>

<p>Suddenly the Apache's attention was attracted by a sound coming
from the south, a rhythmical sound that announced the approach of a
loping horse. Two of the three men drew quickly behind a great
boulder, the third behind another upon the opposite side of the
road. Silence once more enveloped the seemingly deserted
canyon.</p>

<p>The Apache waited, watching. The loping horse drew nearer. It
entered the lower end of the canyon and presently came within range
of Shoz-Dijiji's vision. Its rider was a girl&mdash;a white girl.
As she came abreast of the three whites they rode directly into the
trail and barred her passage, and as she sought to wheel her horse
one of them reached out and seized her bridle rein.</p>

<p>The girl reached for a six-shooter that hung at her hip, but
another of the three had slipped from his saddle and run to her
side. Now he grasped her wrist, tore the weapon from its holster,
and dragged the girl to the ground. It was all done very quickly.
Shoz-Dijiji watched. His hatred of the men mounted.</p>

<p>He heard the conversation that passed between the men and the
girl and understood it&mdash;understood that the men were going to
take the girl away by force. He saw one of them&mdash;the one that
he was facing now in the back room of the Hog Ranch&mdash;jerk the
girl roughly and order her to remount her horse.</p>

<p>Then the barrel of a rifle slid quietly from beneath the edge of
a grey boulder at the top of the canyon's wall, there was a loud
report that resounded thunderously, and the man whose hand lay upon
Wichita Billings dropped in his tracks.</p>

<p>From that moment to this Shoz-Dijiji had thought "Dirty" Cheetim
dead, yet here he was in the flesh, looking him straight in the eye
and smiling. Shoz-Dijiji knew that Cheetim would not be smiling if
he had recognized Shoz-Dijiji.</p>

<p>"How, John!" exclaimed the white man. "Mebby so you want
red-eye, eh?"</p>

<p>In no slightest degree did Shoz-Dijiji register by any changed
expression the surprise he felt at seeing this man alive, nor the
hatred that he felt for him, nor the terrific urge he experienced
to kill him. He looked at him just once, briefly, and then ignored
him as he did his greeting and his question. Instead he turned to
the Apache standing behind Cheetim.</p>

<p>It was Gian-nah-tah. In one hand he held a glass of whiskey, in
the other a bottle. Shoz-Dijiji looked straight into the eyes of
his friend for a moment, and those of Gian-nah-tah wavered and
dropped beneath the steady, accusing gaze of the Black Bear; then
the latter spoke in the language of the Shis-Inday.</p>

<p>"Gian-nah-tah, you are a fool!" said Shoz-Dijiji. "Of all the
things that the white-eyed men have to offer the Apache only their
weapons and their ammunition are of any value to us&mdash;all else
is vile. And you, Gian-nah-tah, choose the vilest. You are a
fool!</p>

<p>"Our own tizwin and the mescal of the Mexicans is bad medicine,
but this fire-water of the white-eyed men is poison. To drink it is
the madness of a fool, but even worse is the drinking of it in
friendship with the white-eyed dogs.</p>

<p>"You are a fool to drink it&mdash;you are a traitor to drink
with the enemies of your people. Put down the glass and the bottle,
and come with me!"</p>

<p>Gian-nah-tah looked up angrily now. Already he had had a couple
of drinks of the vile concoction, and they had had their effect
upon him.</p>

<p>"Gian-nah-tah is a warrior!" he exclaimed, "not a child. Who are
you to tell Gian-nah-tah to do this, or not to do that, or to come
or go?"</p>

<p>"I am his best friend," said Shoz-Dijiji, simply.</p>

<p>"Then go away and mind your own business!" snapped Gian-nah-tah,
and he raised the glass to his lips.</p>

<p>With the swift, soft sinuosity of a cat Shoz-Dijiji stepped
forward and struck the glass from his friend's hand and almost in
the same movement seized the bottle and hurled it to the floor.</p>

<p>"Here, you damn Siwash!" cried Cheetim; "what the hell you think
you're doin'?" He advanced belligerently. Shoz-Dijiji turned upon
the white man. Towering above him he gave the fellow one look that
sent him cowering back. Perhaps it was fortunate for the peace of
San Carlos that "Dirty" Cheetim had left his gun behind the bar,
for he was the type of bad-man that shoots an unarmed
adversary.</p>

<p>But Gian-nah-tah, Be-don-ko-he warrior, was not thus a coward;
and his finer sensibilities were numbed by the effects of the
whiskey he had drunk. He did not shrink from Shoz-Dijiji. Instead,
he whipped his knife from its scabbard and struck a savage blow at
the breast of his best friend.</p>

<p>Shoz-Dijiji had turned away from Cheetim just in time to meet
Gian-nah-tah's attack. Quickly he leaped aside as the knife fell
and then sprang close again and seized Gian-nah-tah's knife wrist
with the fingers of his left hand. Like a steel vise his grip
tightened. Gian-nah-tah struck at him with his free hand, but
Shoz-Dijiji warded the blow.</p>

<p>"Drop it!" commanded the Black Bear and struck Gian-nah-tah
across the face with his open palm. The latter struggled to free
himself, striking futilely at the giant that held him.</p>

<p>"Drop it!" repeated Shoz-Dijiji. Again he struck
Gian-nah-tah&mdash;and again, and again. His grasp tightened upon
the other's wrist, stopping the circulation&mdash;until
Gian-nah-tah thought that his bones were being crushed. His fingers
relaxed. The knife clattered to the floor. Shoz-Dijiji stooped
quickly and recovered it; then he released his hold upon
Gian-nah-tah.</p>

<p>"Go!" commanded the Black Bear, pointing toward the doorway.</p>

<p>For an instant Gian-nah-tah hesitated; then he turned and walked
from the room. Without even a glance in the direction of Cheetim,
Shoz-Dijiji followed his friend. As they passed the bar the girl
called Goldie smiled into the face of Shoz-Dijiji.</p>

<p>"Come down and see me sometime, John," she said.</p>

<p>Without a word or a look the Apache passed out of the building,
away from the refining influences of white man's civilization.</p>

<p>Sullenly, Gian-nah-tah walked to where two ponies were tied.
From the tie-rail he unfastened the hackamore rope of one of them
and vaulted to the animal's back. In silence Shoz-Dijiji handed
Gian-nah-tah his knife. In silence the other Apache took it,
wheeled his pony, and loped away toward the Be-don-ko-he village.
Astride Nejeunee Shoz-Dijiji followed slowly&mdash;erect, silent,
somber; only his heart was bowed, in sorrow.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>As Shoz-Dijiji approached the village he met Geronimo and two
warriors riding in the direction of the military post. They were
angry and excited. The old War Chief beckoned Shoz-Dijiji to join
them.</p>

<p>"What has happened?" asked the Black Bear.</p>

<p>"The soldiers have come and driven away our herd," replied
Geronimo.</p>

<p>"Where are you going?"</p>

<p>"I am going to see Nan-tan-des-la-par-en," replied Geronimo,
"and ask him why the soldiers have stolen our horses and cattle. It
is always thus when we would live at peace with the white-eyed men
they will not let us. Always they do something that arouses the
anger of the Shis-Inday and makes the young braves want to go upon
the war trail. Now, if they do not give us back our cattle, it will
be difficult to keep the young men in peace upon the
reservation&mdash;or the old men either."</p>

<p>At the post Geronimo rode directly to headquarters and demanded
to see General Crook, and a few minutes later the four braves were
ushered into the presence of the officer.</p>

<p>"I have been expecting you, Geronimo," said Crook.</p>

<p>"Then you knew that the soldiers were going to steal our herds?"
demanded the War Chief.</p>

<p>"They have not stolen them, Geronimo," replied the officer. "It
is you who stole them. They do not belong to you. The soldiers have
taken them away from you to return them to their rightful owners.
Every time you steal horses or cattle they will be taken away from
you and returned. You promised me once that you would not steal any
more, but yet you went out and killed and stole."</p>

<p>"We did not go upon the war trail against the white-eyed men,"
replied Geronimo. "We were going down into Mexico, and your
soldiers attacked us and tried to stop us."</p>

<p>"It was the Apaches who started the fight at Apache Pass," Crook
reminded him.</p>

<p>"It was the Apaches who fired the first shot," corrected
Geronimo, "but they did not start the fight. You started it by
sending troops to stop us. We are neither fools nor children. We
knew why those troops were marching to Apache Pass. Had they seen
us first they would have fired the first shot. You cannot say that
we started the fight just because our chiefs and our warriors are
better soldiers than yours. You would have been glad enough to have
surprised us, but you were not wise enough."</p>

<p>Crook smiled. "You say you are not a fool nor a child,
Geronimo," he said. "Well, neither am I. You went out with a bad
heart to kill innocent people and rob them. It got too hot for you
in Mexico, and so you came back here and brought your stolen herds
with you. You are no fool, Geronimo, and so I know you were not
foolish enough to think that we would let you keep these cattle. I
do not know why you did it, unless you just wanted to make more
trouble."</p>

<p>"I did not want to make trouble," replied the chief. "We were at
war with the Mexicans. We took the horses and cattle as spoils of
war. They belong to us. They do not belong to you. They were not
taken from your people but from Mexicans. Your own country has been
at war with Mexico in the past. Did you return everything that you
took from them at that time?"</p>

<p>"But we are not at war with them now. We are friends. You cannot
steal from our friends. If we let you they will say that we are not
their friends."</p>

<p>"That is not true," replied Geronimo. "The Mexicans are not
fools, either. They know the difference between Apaches and
white-eyed men. They know that it was the Apaches, with whom they
are at war, who took their herds. They do not think that it was
you. If you take the herds from us and return them to the Mexicans,
both the Mexicans and the Apaches will think that you are fools. If
you took them and kept them, that would be different. That is
precisely what I, we did and what we would do again. You say that
you do not want to be at war with the Apaches&mdash;that we are
good friends! How then can you make me believe that it is right to
take cattle from your friends?"</p>

<p>Crook shook his head.</p>

<p>"It's no use, Geronimo," he said.</p>

<p>"How can we live if you take our herds from us?" demanded the
Apache. "With these cattle and horses we were rich. We did not
intend to kill them. We were going to breed them and thus become
richer, so that we would not have to go out raiding again. It was
our chance to live comfortably and in peace with the white-eyed
men. Now you have taken this chance from us. We cannot live here
and starve."</p>

<p>"You do not have to starve," replied Crook. "The government
rations are ample to take care of you."</p>

<p>"We do not get them. You know that we do not get them. The Agent
robs us. Every man knows that. Now you rob us. I told you that I
wished to live in peace with the white-eyed men, but I cannot
control the young men when they learn that you will not return
their cattle and horses. If they make trouble do not blame me. I
did not do it. You did it. I have spoken!"</p>

<p>"There will be no trouble, Geronimo," said Crook, "if you do not
start it. I cannot give you back the cattle. Go back to your camp
and tell your people that. Tell them that the next time they go out
and kill and steal I shall not be as easy with them. The next time
they will be punished, just as any murderers are. Do you hear?"</p>

<p>"Geronimo hears, but he does not understand," replied the War
Chief. "Usen seems to have made one set of laws for the Apaches and
another for the white-eyed men. It is right for the white-eyed men
to come into the country of the Apaches and steal their land and
kill their game and shut the Apaches up on reservations and shoot
them if they try to go to some other part of their own country; but
it is wrong for the Apaches to fight with the Mexicans who have
been their natural enemies since long before the white-eyed men
came to the country. It is wrong for the Apaches to profit by their
victories against their enemies.</p>

<p>"Yes, Geronimo hears; but he does not understand."</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="chap3" id="chap3">III. &mdash; "NO SABE!"</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">AS Shoz-Dijiji followed Geronimo and the two
braves from General Crook's office, a white girl chanced to be
passing in front of head-quarters. Her eyes and the eyes of
Shoz-Dijiji met, and into the eyes of the girl leaped the light of
recognition and pleasure.</p>

<p>"Shoz-Dijiji!" she exclaimed. "I am so glad to see you again."
The brave stopped and looked gravely into her face, listening to
her words. "I am visiting with Mrs. Cullis. Won't you come and see
me?"</p>

<p>"No sabe," said Shoz-Dijiji and brushed past her to rejoin his
fellows.</p>

<p>A flush of mortification colored the face of Wichita Billings;
and the fire of anger and resentment lighted her eyes, but the
flush quickly faded and, as quickly, an expression of sorrow
supplanted that of displeasure. For a moment she stood looking
after the tall, straight form of the Apache as he walked toward his
pony; and then, with a sigh, she resumed her way.</p>

<p>A white man, coming from the canteen, had witnessed the meeting
between Shoz-Dijiji and Wichita Billings. He had recognized the
girl immediately and the Indian as the same that had, a short time
before, spoiled a sale for him and smashed a bottle of whiskey upon
the floor of his back room.</p>

<p>He was surprised to see Wichita Billings at the post, and as she
turned again in his direction he stepped quickly behind the corner
of a building and waited there until she had passed.</p>

<p>The natural expression that mirrored in the face of "Dirty"
Cheetim, whatever atrophied thing may have done questionable duty
as his soul, was evil; but peculiarly unclean was the look in his
eyes as he watched the girl walking briskly along the path that led
to the officers' quarters.</p>

<p>Presently his eyes wandered to the figure of the Apache brave
riding across the parade on the pinto stallion, and his brows
contracted in thought. Where had he seen that buck before?&mdash;a
long time before. There was something mighty familiar about
him&mdash;something that Cheetim had not noticed until he saw the
Indian talking with Wichita Billings; but even so he failed to
connect the associated ideas that had subconsciously aroused the
suggestion of previous familiarity, and so, dismissing the matter
from his mind, he went on about his affairs.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>Geronimo rode back to the camp of the Be-don-ko-he in silence.
It was as impossible for him to get the viewpoint of the white man
as it was for the white man to get the viewpoint of the Apache. He
felt that he had been treated with rank injustice and treachery.
Geronimo was furious, yet his stern, inscrutable face gave no
evidence of what was passing in his savage brain. He did not rant
nor rave, raising his voice in loud oaths, as might a white man
under stress of similar circumstance.</p>

<p>Geronimo dismounted before his hogan and turned to Shoz-Dijiji
and the others who had accompanied him. "Tell the braves of the
Be-don-ko-he that Geronimo is going away from San Carlos," he said.
"Perhaps they would like to come and talk with Geronimo before he
goes."</p>

<p>As the three braves rode away through the village Geronimo sat
down before the entrance to his hogan. "Geronimo cannot live in
peace with thieves and liars, Morning Star," he said to his wife.
"Therefore we shall go away and live as Usen intended that we
should live. He never meant that we should live with the white-eyed
men."</p>

<p>"We are going on the war trail again?" asked Sons-ee-ah-ray.</p>

<p>Geronimo shook his head. "No," he replied. "If they will leave
Geronimo alone he will not fight the pindah-lickoyee again.
Geronimo wishes only to lead his own life in his own way far from
any pindah-lickoyee. In that way only lies peace."</p>

<p>"Sons-ee-ah-ray will be glad to leave San Carlos," said the
squaw. "She will be glad to go anywhere to get away from the
white-eyed men. They are bad. Their women are bad, and they think
because their women are bad that the Apache women are bad. The
white-eyed men make bad talk to Sons-ee-ah-ray when she passes them
on her way to the Agency. She will be glad not to hear this talk
any more.</p>

<p>"Geronimo knows that Sons-ee-ah-ray, the mother of his children,
is a good woman. Why, then, do the white-eyed men talk thus to
her?"</p>

<p>The War Chief shook his head. "I do not know," he said. "I do
not understand the white-eyed men."</p>

<p>When the warriors of the Be-don-ko-he gathered, many of the
older men appeared apprehensive. They looked sad and worried but
the young men were excited and gay. Many of the latter were already
painting their faces, but when Geronimo saw this he frowned and
shook his head.</p>

<p>"Geronimo is going away," he said, "because he can no longer
live under the conditions that the white-eyed men impose and still
maintain his self respect; but he does not mean, as some of the
young men seem to think, that he is going to take the war trail
against the pindah-lickoyee.</p>

<p>"With his family he is going up somewhere around Fort Apache and
live in the mountains where he will not have to see any
white-eyes."</p>

<p>"We will go with you!" said many of the Be-don-ko-he.</p>

<p>"No," remonstrated Geronimo. "If you go with me the Agent will
say that Geronimo has gone out again with his warriors, but if only
Geronimo and his own family go the Agent cannot say that Geronimo
has gone upon the war trail.</p>

<p>"If you come with me they will send soldiers after us; and then
there will be war, and already there have been enough of us killed.
Therefore Geronimo goes alone."</p>

<p>"Shoz-Dijiji, my son, will remain here for a while and learn if
the white-eyed men are going to make trouble because Geronimo has
left San Carlos. If they do, he will bring the word to me; and then
I shall know what next to do; but I shall not return to San Carlos
to be treated like a fool and a child&mdash;no, not I, Geronimo,
War Chief of all the Apaches!"</p>

<p>And so that night Geronimo, with all his family except
Shoz-Dijiji, rode silently northward toward Fort Apache; and at San
Carlos the Indians, the Agent and the soldiers slept in peaceful
ignorance of this event that was so soon to lead to the writing of
one of history's bloodiest pages. After Geronimo had left,
Shoz-Dijiji sought out Gian-nah-tah with whom he had had no
opportunity to speak since the moment of their altercation in the
Hog Ranch. In the heart of the Black Bear was only love for this
friend of his childhood; and while he knew that Gian-nah-tah had
been very angry with him at the time, he attributed this mostly to
the effect of the whiskey he had drunk, believing that when this
had worn off, and Gian-nah-tah had had time to reflect, he would
harbor no ill will.</p>

<p>Shoz-Dijiji found his friend sitting alone over a tiny fire and
came and squatted down beside him. Neither spoke, but that was
nothing unusual. Near by, before her hogan, a squaw was praying to
the moon. "Gun-ju-le, klego-m-ay," she chanted.</p>

<p>At a little distance a warrior cast hoddentin into the air and
prayed: "Gun-ju-le, chil-jilt, Si-chi-zi, gun-ju-le, inzayu,
ijanale, Be good, O Night; Twilight, be good; do not let me die."
Peace and quiet lay upon the camp of the Be-don-ko-he.</p>

<p>"Today," said Shoz-Dijiji, "I recognized the white-eyed man who
sells fire-water to the Apaches. He is the man who tried to steal
the white-eyed girl that day that Gian-nah-tah and Shoz-Dijiji were
scouting near the hogan of her father.</p>

<p>"I thought that I killed him that day; but today I saw him
again, selling fire-water to Gian-nah-tah. He is a very bad man.
Some day I shall kill him; but I shall do it when no one is around
to see, for the white-eyed fools would put me in prison as quickly
for killing a bad man as a good man."</p>

<p>Gian-nah-tah made no reply. Shoz-Dijiji turned and looked into
the face of his friend. "Is Gian-nah-tah still angry?" he
asked.</p>

<p>Gian-nah-tah arose, turned around, and squatted down again with
his back toward Shoz-Dijiji. The Black Bear shook his head sadly;
then he stood up. For a moment he hesitated as though about to
speak; but instead he turned, drew his blanket more closely about
him, and walked away. His heart was heavy. During his short life he
had seen many of his friends killed in battle; he had seen little
Ish-kay-nay, his first love, die in his arms, slain by the bullet
of a white man; he had seen the look of horror in the eyes of the
white girl he had grown to love, when he had avowed that love; he
had just seen his father and his mother driven by the injustices of
the white conqueror from the society of their own kind; and now he
had lost his best friend. The heart of Shoz-Dijiji, the Black Bear,
was heavy indeed.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>Wichita Billings was visiting in the home of Margaret Cullis at
the post. The two were sitting in the modest parlor, the older
woman sewing, the younger reading. Presently Wichita closed her
book and laid it on the table.</p>

<p>"I can't seem to get interested," she said. "I don't feel very
'literary' tonight."</p>

<p>"You haven't been yourself all day," said Mrs. Cullis. "Aren't
you feeling well?"</p>

<p>"I feel all right, physically," replied the girl, "but I'm
blue."</p>

<p>"About what?"</p>

<p>"O, nothing&mdash;I just feel blue. Didn't you ever feel that
way when there wasn't any reason for it?"</p>

<p>"There usually is a reason."</p>

<p>"I suppose so. Perhaps it's in the air." There was a silence
that lasted a minute or two. "Lieutenant King's calling this
evening."</p>

<p>"I'm sure that shouldn't make you blue, my dear girl," exclaimed
Margaret Cullis, laughing.</p>

<p>"Well, it doesn't cheer me up much, because I know what he's
going to say; and I know what I'm going to answer. It's always the
same thing."</p>

<p>"I can't see why you don't love him, Wichita. It would be a
wonderful match for you."</p>

<p>"Yes, for me; but not for him. His people would be ashamed of
me."</p>

<p>"Don't be silly! There isn't any man or any family too good for
you&mdash;I doubt if there is any good enough for you."</p>

<p>"You're a dear, but the fact remains that they are stiff-backed
Bostonians with more culture than there is in the whole state that
I came from and a family tree that started as a seedling in the
Garden of Eden, while I got most of my education out of a mail
order catalog; and if I ever had a family tree it must have been
blown away by a Kansas cyclone while my folks were fighting
Indians.</p>

<p>"And speaking of Indians, whom do you think I saw today?"</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"Shoz-Dijiji!"</p>

<p>Margaret Cullis looked up quickly. Was it the intonation of the
girl's voice as she spoke the name! The older woman frowned and
looked down at her work again. "What did he have to say?" she
asked.</p>

<p>"Nothing."</p>

<p>"Oh, you didn't see him to talk with?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but he wouldn't talk to me. He just fell back on that
maddening 'No sabe' that they use with strangers."</p>

<p>"Why do you suppose he did that?" asked Mrs. Cullis.</p>

<p>"I hurt him the last time I saw him," replied Wichita.</p>

<p>"Hurt one of Geronimo's renegades! Child, it can't be done."</p>

<p>"They're human!" replied the girl. "I learned that in the days
that I spent in Geronimo's camp while Chief Loco was out with his
hostiles. Among themselves they are entirely different people from
those we are accustomed to see on the reservation. No one who has
watched them with their children, seen them at their games, heard
them praying to Dawn and Twilight, to the Sun, the Moon, and the
Stars as they cast their sacred hoddentin to the winds would ever
again question their possession of the finer instincts of sentiment
and imagination.</p>

<p>"Because they do not wear their hearts upon their sleeves,
because they are not blatant in the declaration of their finer
emotions, does not mean that they feel no affection or that they
are incapable of experiencing spiritual suffering."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," said Margaret Cullis, "but you, who have lived in
Indian country all your life, who have seen the heartless cruelties
they inflict upon their helpless victims, who know their treachery
and their dishonesty, cannot but admit that whatever qualities of
goodness they possess are far outweighed by those others which have
made them hated and feared the length and breadth of the
Southwest."</p>

<p>"For every wrong that they have committed," argued Wichita,
"they can point out a similar crime perpetrated upon them by the
whites. O, Margaret, it is the old case again of the pot calling
the kettle black. We have tortured them and wronged them even more
than they have tortured and wronged us.</p>

<p>"We esteem personal comfort and life as our two most sacred
possessions. When the Apaches torture and kill us we believe that
they have committed against us the most hideous of conceivable
crimes.</p>

<p>"On the other hand the Apaches do not esteem personal comfort
and life as highly as do we and consequently, by their
standards&mdash;and we may judge a people justly only by their own
standards&mdash;we have not suffered as much as they, who esteem
more highly than life or personal comfort the sanctity of their
ancient rites and customs and the chastity of their women. From the
time of the white man's first contact with the Apaches he has
ridiculed the one and defiled the other.</p>

<p>"I have talked with Shoz-Dijiji, and Geronimo, with
Sons-ee-ah-ray, and many another Be-don-ko-he man and woman; they
have laid bare their hearts to me, and never again can anyone
convince me that we have not tortured the Apaches with as malignant
cruelty as they have tortured us."</p>

<p>"Why you are a regular little Apache yourself, Wichita," cried
Margaret Cullis. "I wonder what your father would say if he could
hear you."</p>

<p>"He has heard me. Don't think for a minute that I am afraid to
express my views to anyone."</p>

<p>"Did he enjoy them and agree with you?"</p>

<p>"He did not. He did everything but tear his hair and take me out
to the woodshed. You know Mason was killed about two months ago,
and it had all the ear-marks of an Apache killing. Mason was one of
Dad's best friends. Now, every time he thinks or hears Apache he
sees red."</p>

<p>"I don't blame him," said Margaret Cullis.</p>

<p>"It's silly," snapped Wichita, "and I tell him so. It would be
just as logical to hate all French-Canadians because Guiteau
assassinated President Garfield."</p>

<p>"Well, how in the world, feeling toward the Apaches as you do,
could you have found it in your heart to so wound Shoz-Dijiji that
he will not speak to you?"</p>

<p>"I did not mean to," explained the girl. "It&mdash;just
happened. We had been together for many days after the Chi-e-a-hen
attacked the Pringe ranch and Shoz-Dijiji got me away from them.
The country was full of hostiles, and so he took me to the safest
place he could think of&mdash;the Be-don-ko-he camp. They kept me
there until they were sure that all the hostiles had crossed the
border into Mexico. He was lovely to me&mdash;a white man could
have been no more considerate&mdash;but when he got me home again
and was about to leave me he told me that he loved me.</p>

<p>"I don't know what it was, Margaret&mdash;inherited instinct,
perhaps&mdash;but the thought of it revolted me, and he must have
seen it in my face. He went away, and I never saw him
again&mdash;until today&mdash;three years."</p>

<p>The older woman looked up quickly from her work. There had been
a note in the girl's voice as she spoke those last two words that
aroused sudden apprehension in the breast of Margaret Cullis.</p>

<p>"Wichita," she demanded, "do you love this&mdash;this
Apache?"</p>

<p>"Margaret," replied the girl, "you have been like a sister to
me, or a mother. No one else could ask me that question. I have not
even dared ask myself." She paused. "No, I cannot love him!"</p>

<p>"It would be unthinkable that you would love an Indian,
Wichita," said the older woman. "It would cut you off forever from
your own kind and would win you only the contempt of the Indians. A
white girl had better be dead than married to an Indian."</p>

<p>Wichita nodded. "Yes, I know," she whispered, "and yet he is as
fine as any man, white or red, that I have ever known."</p>

<p>"Perhaps, but the fact remains that he is an Apache."</p>

<p>"I wish to God that he were white!" exclaimed the girl.</p>

<p>A knock on the door put an end to their conversation, and
Wichita arose from her chair and crossed the room to admit the
caller. A tall, good looking subaltern stood smiling on the
threshold as the door swung in.</p>

<p>"You're prompt," said Wichita.</p>

<p>"A good soldier always is," said Mrs. Cullis.</p>

<p>"That is equivalent to a medal of honor, coming from the wife of
my troop commander," laughed King as he stepped into the room.</p>

<p>"Give me your cap," said Wichita, "and bring that nice easy
chair up here beside the table."</p>

<p>"I was going to suggest that we take a walk," said King, "that
is if you ladies would care to. It's a gorgeous night."</p>

<p>"Suits me," agreed Wichita. "How about you, Margaret?"</p>

<p>"I want to finish my sewing. You young folks run along and have
your walk, and perhaps Captain Cullis will be here when you get
back. If he is we'll have a game of eucre."</p>

<p>"I wish you'd come," said Wichita.</p>

<p>"Yes, do!" begged King, but Mrs. Cullis only smiled and shook
her head.</p>

<p>"Run along now," she cried gaily, "and don't forget the
game."</p>

<p>"We'll not be gone long," King assured her. "I wish you'd come
with us."</p>

<p>"Sweet boy," thought Margaret Cullis as the door closed behind
them, leaving her alone. "Sweet boy, but not very truthful."</p>

<p>As Wichita and King stepped out into the crisp, cool air of an
Arizona night the voice of the sentry at the guard house rang out
clearly against the silence: "Number One, eight o'clock!" They
paused to listen as the next sentry passed the call on: "Number
Two, eight o'clock. All's well!" Around the chain of sentries it
went, fainter in the distance, growing again in volume to the
final, "All's well!" of Number One.</p>

<p>"I thought you said it was a gorgeous night," remarked Wichita
Billings. "There is no moon, it's cloudy and dark as a pocket."</p>

<p>"But I still insist that it is gorgeous," said King, smiling.
"All Arizona nights are."</p>

<p>"I don't like these black ones," said Wichita; "I've lived in
Indian country too long. Give me the moon every time."</p>

<p>"They scarcely ever attack at night," King reminded her.</p>

<p>"I know, but there may always be an exception to prove the
rule."</p>

<p>"Not much chance that they will attack the post," said King.</p>

<p>"I know that, but the fact remains that a black night always
suggests the possibility to me."</p>

<p>"I'll admit that the sentries do suggest a larger assurance of
safety on a night like this," said King. "We at least know that we
shall have a little advance information before any Apache is among
us."</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>Numbers Three and Four were mounted posts, and at the very
instant that King was speaking a shadowy form crept between the two
sentries as they rode slowly in opposite directions along their
posts. It was Shoz-Dijiji.</p>

<p>Though the Apache had demonstrated conclusively that Wichita
Billings' intuitive aversion to dark nights might be fully
warranted, yet in this particular instance no danger threatened the
white inhabitants of the army post, as Shoz-Dijiji's mission was
hostile only in the sense that it was dedicated to espionage.</p>

<p>Geronimo had charged him with the duty of ascertaining the
attitude of the white officers toward the departure of the War
Chief from the reservation, and with this purpose in view the Black
Bear had hit upon the bold scheme of entering the post and
reporting Geronimo's departure in person that he might have first
hand knowledge of Nan-tan-des-la-par-en's reaction.</p>

<p>He might have come in openly in the light of day without
interference, but it pleased him to come as he did as a
demonstration of the superiority of Apache cunning and of his
contempt for the white man's laws.</p>

<p>He moved silently in the shadows of buildings, making his way
toward the adobe shack that was dignified by the title of
Headquarters. Once he was compelled to stop for several minutes in
the dense shadow at the end of a building as he saw two figures
approaching slowly. Nearer and nearer they came. Shoz-Dijiji saw
that one was an officer, a war chief of the pindah-lickoyee, and
the other was a woman. They were talking earnestly. When they were
quite close to Shoz-Dijiji the white officer stopped and laid a
hand upon the arm of his companion.</p>

<p>"Wait, Wichita," he said. "Before we go in can't you give me
some hope for the future? I'm willing to wait. Don't you think that
some day you might care for me a little?"</p>

<p>The girl walked on, followed by the man. "I care for you a great
deal, Ad," Shoz-Dijiji heard her say in a low voice just before the
two passed out of his hearing; "but I can never care for you in the
way you wish." That, Shoz-Dijiji did not hear.</p>

<p>"You love someone else?" he asked. In the darkness he did not
see the hot flush that overspread her face as she replied.</p>

<p>"I am afraid so," she said.</p>

<p>"Afraid so! What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"It is something that I cannot tell you, Ad. It hurts me to talk
about it."</p>

<p>"Does he know that you love him?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Is it anyone I know?"</p>

<p>"Please, Ad, I don't like to talk about it."</p>

<p>Lieutenant Samuel Adams King walked on in silence at the girl's
side until they reached Mrs. Cullis' door. "I'm going to
wait&mdash;and hope, Chita," he said just before they entered the
house.</p>

<p>Captain Cullis had not returned, and the three sat and chatted
for a few minutes; but it was evident to Margaret Cullis that
something had occurred to dash the spirits of her young guests, nor
was she at a loss to guess the truth. Being very fond of them both;
believing that they were eminently suited to one another, and,
above all, being a natural born match maker, Margaret Cullis was
determined to leave no stone unturned that might tend toward a
happy consummation of her hopes.</p>

<p>"You know that Chita is leaving us in the morning?" she asked
King, by way of inaugurating her campaign.</p>

<p>"Why, no," he exclaimed, "she did not tell me."</p>

<p>"I should have told you before you left," said the girl. "I
wouldn't go without saying good-bye, you know."</p>

<p>"I should hope not," said King.</p>

<p>"She really should not take that long ride alone," volunteered
Mrs. Cullis.</p>

<p>"It is nothing," exclaimed Wichita. "I've been riding alone ever
since I can recall."</p>

<p>"Of course she shouldn't," said King. "It's not safe. I'll get
leave to ride home with you. May I?"</p>

<p>"I'd love to have you, but really it's not necessary."</p>

<p>"I think it is," said King. "I'll go over to headquarters now
and arrange it. I think there'll be no objections raised."</p>

<p>"I'm leaving pretty early," warned Wichita.</p>

<p>"What time?"</p>

<p>"Five o'clock."</p>

<p>"I'll be here!"</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="chap4" id="chap4">IV. &mdash; GIAN-NAH-TAH RELENTS</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">"I CARE for you a great deal, Ad!" Shoz-Dijiji
heard these words and recognized the voice of the girl who had
spurned his love. Now he recognized her companion also.</p>

<p>Wounded pride, racial hatred, the green eyed monster, jealousy,
clamored at the gates of his self-restraint, sought to tear down
the barriers and loose the savage warrior upon the authors of his
misery. His hand crept to the hunting knife at his hip, the only
weapon that he carried; but Shoz-Dijiji was master of his own will;
and the two passed on, out of his sight, innocent of any faintest
consciousness that they had paused within the shadow of the Apache
Devil.</p>

<p><br>
A half hour later a tall, straight figure loomed suddenly before
the sentry at Headquarters. The cavalryman, dismounted, snapped his
carbine to port as he challenged: "Halt! Who is there?"</p>

<p>"I have come to talk with Nan-tan-des-la-par-en," said
Shoz-Dijiji in Apache.</p>

<p>"Hell!" muttered the sentry, "if it ain't a damned Siwash," and
shouted for the corporal of the guard. "Stay where you are, John,"
he cautioned the Indian, "until the corporal comes, or I'll have to
make a good Indian of you."</p>

<p>"No sabe," said Shoz-Dijiji.</p>

<p>"You'd better savvy," warned the soldier.</p>

<p>The corporal of the guard appeared suddenly out of the darkness.
"Wot the hell now?" he demanded. "Who the hell's this?"</p>

<p>"It's a God damn Siwash."</p>

<p>"How the hell did he get inside the lines?"</p>

<p>"How the hell should I know? Here he is, and he don't savvy
United States."</p>

<p>The corporal addressed Shoz-Dijiji. "Wot the hell you want here,
John?" he demanded.</p>

<p>Again the Apache replied in his own tongue. "Try Mex on him,"
suggested the sentry.</p>

<p>"Some of 'em savvy that lingo all right."</p>

<p>In broken, badly broken, Spanish the corporal of the guard
repeated his questions.</p>

<p>"No sabe," lied Shoz-Dijiji again.</p>

<p>"Hadn't you better shove him in the guard house?" suggested the
sentry. "He aint got no business inside the post at night."</p>

<p>"I think he wants to talk to the Old Man&mdash;he keeps sayin'
that fool Siwash name they got for Crook. You hold him here while I
goes and reports to the O.D. And say, if he ain't good don't forget
that it costs Uncle Sam less to bury a Injun than to feed him."</p>

<p>It chanced that the Officer of the Day was one of the few white
men in the southwest who understood even a little of the language
of the Apaches, and when he returned with the corporal he asked
Shoz-Dijiji what he wanted.</p>

<p>"I have a message for Nan-tan-des-la-par-en!" replied the
Apache.</p>

<p>"You may give it to me!" said the officer. "I will tell General
Crook."</p>

<p>"My message is for General Crook! Not for you," replied
Shoz-Dijiji.</p>

<p>"General Crook will be angry if you bother him now with some
matter that is not important. You had better tell me."</p>

<p>"It is important," replied Shoz-Dijiji.</p>

<p>"Come with me," directed the officer, and led the way into the
headquarters building.</p>

<p>"Please inform General Crook," he said to the orderly in the
outer office, "that Captain Crawford has an Apache here who says
that he brings an important message for the General."</p>

<p>A moment later Shoz-Dijiji and Captain Crawford stepped into
General Crook's presence. Captain Cullis was sitting at one end of
the table behind which Crook sat, while Lieutenant King stood
facing the commanding officer from whom he had just requested leave
to escort Wichita Billings to her home.</p>

<p>"Just a moment King," said Crook. "You needn't leave.</p>

<p>"Well, Crawford," turning to the Officer of the Day, "what does
this man want?"</p>

<p>"He says that he has an important message for you, sir. He
refuses to deliver it to anyone else; neither and as he apparently
speaks nor understands English I came with him to interpret, if you
wish, sir."</p>

<p>"Very good! Tell him that I say you are to interpret his
message. Ask him who he is and what he wants."</p>

<p>Crawford repeated Crook's words to Shoz-Dijiji.</p>

<p>"Tell Nan-tan-des-la-par-en that I am Shoz-Dijiji, the son of
Geronimo. I have come to tell him that my father has left the
reservation."</p>

<p>Shoz-Dijiji saw in the faces of the men about him the effect of
his words. To announce that Geronimo had gone out again was like
casting a bomb into a peace meeting.</p>

<p>"Ask him where Geronimo has gone and how many warriors are with
him," snapped Crook.</p>

<p>"Geronimo has not gone on the war trail," replied Shoz-Dijiji
after Crawford had put the question to him, waiting always for the
interpretation of Crook's words though he understood them perfectly
in English. "There are no warriors with Geronimo other than his
son. He has taken his wife with him and his small children. He
wishes only to go away and live in peace. He cannot live in peace
with the white-eyed men. He does not wish to fight the white-eyed
soldiers any more."</p>

<p>"Where has he gone?" asked Crook again.</p>

<p>"He has gone toward Sonora," lied Shoz-Dijiji, that being the
opposite of the direction taken by Geronimo; but Shoz-Dijiji was
working with the cunning of an Apache. He knew well that Geronimo's
absence from the reservation might well come to the attention of
the authorities on the morrow; and he hoped that by announcing it
himself and explaining that it was not the result of warlike
intentions they might pass it over and let the War Chief live where
he wished, but if not then it would give Geronimo time to make good
his escape if the troops were sent upon a wild goose chase toward
Sonora, while it would also allow Shoz-Dijiji ample time to
overhaul his father and report the facts. Furthermore, by bringing
the message himself and by assuming ignorance of English, he was in
a position where he might possibly learn the plans of the
white-eyed men concerning Geronimo. All-in-all, Shoz-Dijiji felt
that his strategy was not without merit.</p>

<p>Crook sat in silence for a moment, tugging on his great beard.
Presently he turned to Captain Cullis.</p>

<p>"Hold yourself in readiness to march at daylight, Cullis, with
all the available men of your troop. Proceed by the most direct
route to Apache Pass and try to pick up the trail. Bring Geronimo
back, alive if you can. If he resists, kill him."</p>

<p>"Crawford, I shall have you relieved immediately. You also will
march at dawn. Go directly south. You will each send out
detachments to the east and west. Keep in touch with one another.
Whatever else you do, bring back Geronimo!"</p>

<p>He swung back toward Shoz-Dijiji. "Crawford, give this man some
tobacco for bringing me this information, and see that he is passed
through the sentries and sent back to his camp. Tell him that
Geronimo had no business leaving the reservation and that he will
have to come back, but do not let him suspect that we are sending
troops after him."</p>

<p>The corporal of the guard escorted Shoz-Dijiji through the line
of sentries, and as they were about to part the Apache handed the
soldier the sack of tobacco that Captain Crawford had given
him.</p>

<p>"You're not such a bad Indian, at that," commented the corporal,
"but," he added, scratching his head, "I'd like to know how in hell
you got into the post in the first place."</p>

<p>"Me no sabe," said Shoz-Dijiji.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>Mrs. Cullis arose early the following morning and went directly
to Wichita's room, where she found her guest already dressed in
flannel shirt, buckskin skirt, and high heeled boots, ready for her
long ride back to the Billings' ranch.</p>

<p>"I thought I'd catch you before you got dressed," said the older
woman.</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"You can't go today. Geronimo has gone out again. 'B' Troop and
Captain Crawford's scouts have started after him already. Both
Captain Cullis and Mister King have gone out with 'B' Troop; but
even if there were anyone to go with you, it won't be safe until
they have Geronimo back on the reservation again."</p>

<p>"How many went out with him?" asked the girl.</p>

<p>"Only his wife and children. The Indians say he has not gone on
the war path, but I wouldn't take any chances with the bloodthirsty
old scoundrel."</p>

<p>"I'm not afraid!" said Wichita. "As long as it's only Geronimo
I'm in no danger even if I meet him, which I won't. You know we are
old friends."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know all about that; but I know you can't trust an
Apache."</p>

<p>"I trust them," said Wichita. She stooped and buckled on her
spurs.</p>

<p>"You don't mean that you are going anyway!"</p>

<p>"Why of course I am."</p>

<p>Margaret Cullis shook her head. "What am I to do?" she demanded
helplessly.</p>

<p>"Give me a cup of coffee before I leave," suggested Wichita.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>The business at the Hog Ranch had been good that night. Two
miners and a couple of cattlemen, all well staked, had dropped in
early in the evening for a couple of drinks and a few rounds of
stud. They were still there at daylight, but they were no longer
well staked.</p>

<p>"Dirty" Cheetim and three or four of his cronies had annexed
their bank rolls. The four guests were sleeping off the effects of
their pleasant evening on the floor of the back room.</p>

<p>"Dirty" and his pals had come out on the front porch to inhale a
breath of fresh air before retiring. An Indian, lithe, straight,
expressionless of face, was approaching the building.</p>

<p>"Hello, John!" said "Dirty" Cheetim through a wide yawn. "What
for you want?"</p>

<p>"Whiskey," said the Apache. "Le' me see the' color of your dust,
John."</p>

<p>A rider coming into view from the direction of the post
attracted Cheetim's attention. "Wait till we see who that is," he
said. "I don't want none of those damn long hairs catchin' me
dishin' red-eye to no Siwash."</p>

<p>They all stood watching the approaching rider. "Why it's a
woman," said one of the men.</p>

<p>"Durned if it ain't," admitted another.</p>

<p>"Hell!" exclaimed Cheetim. "It's Billings' girl&mdash;the
dirty&mdash;!"</p>

<p>"What you got agin' her?" asked one of the party.</p>

<p>"Got against her? Plenty! I offered to marry her, and she turned
me down flat. Then her old man run me offen the ranch. It was lucky
for him that they was a bunch of his cow-hands hangin' around."</p>

<p>The girl passed, her horse swinging along in an easy, running
walk&mdash;the gait that eats up the miles. Down the dusty trail
they passed while the five white men and the Apache stood on the
front porch of the Hog Ranch and watched.</p>

<p>"Neat little heifer," commented one of the former.</p>

<p>"You fellers want to clean up a little dust?" asked Cheetim.</p>

<p>"How?" asked the youngest of the party, a puncher who drank too
much to be able to hold a job even in this country of hard drinking
men.</p>

<p>"Help me c'ral that critter&mdash;she'd boom business in the Hog
Ranch."</p>

<p>"We've helped you put your iron on lots of mavericks; Dirty,"
said the young man. "Whatever you says goes with me."</p>

<p>"Bueno! We'll just slap on our saddles and follow along easy
like till she gets around Pimos Canyon. They's a old shack up there
that some dude built for huntin', but it ain't been used since the
broncos went out under Juh in '81&mdash;say, that just natch'rly
scairt that dude plumb out o' the country. I'll keep her up there a
little while in case anyone raises a stink, and after it blows over
I'll fetch her down to the Ranch. Now who's this a-comin'?"</p>

<p>From the direction of the post a mounted trooper was approaching
at a canter. He drew rein in front of the Hog Ranch.</p>

<p>"Hello, you dirty bums!" he greeted them, with a grin. "You
ain't worth it, but orders is orders, and mine is to notify the
whites in this neck o' the woods that Geronimo's gone out again. I
hope to Christ he gets you," and the messenger spurred on along the
trail.</p>

<p>Cheetim turned to the Apache. "Is that straight, John?" he
asked. "Has Geronimo gone out?"</p>

<p>The Indian nodded affirmatively.</p>

<p>"Now I reckon we got to hang onto our scalps with both hands for
another couple months," wailed the young puncher.</p>

<p>"Geronimo no go on war trail," explained the Apache. "Him just
go away reservation. Him no kill."</p>

<p>"Well, if he ain't on the war-path we might as well mosey along
after the Billings heifer," said Cheetim, with a sigh of relief. He
turned to the Indian. "I ain't got no time now!" he said. "You come
round tomorrow&mdash;maybe so I fix you up then, eh?"</p>

<p>The Apache nodded. "Mebbe so, mebbe not," he replied,
enigmatically; but Cheetim, who had already started for the corral,
failed to note any hidden meaning in the words of the Indian.
Perhaps none had been intended. One seldom knows what may be in the
mind of an Apache.</p>

<p>As the five men saddled and prepared to ride after Wichita
Billings the Indian started back toward the reservation. He had not
understood every word that the white men had spoken; but he had
understood enough, coupled with his knowledge of the sort of men
they were, to fully realize their purpose and the grave danger that
threatened the white girl.</p>

<p>In the heart of Gian-nah-tah was no love for her. In the breast
of Gian-nah-tah burned sullen resentment and anger against
Shoz-Dijiji. When Cheetim's purpose with the girl had first dawned
upon him it had not occurred to him that he might interfere. The
girl had spurned Shoz-Dijiji. Perhaps it would be better if she
were out of the way. But he knew that Shoz-Dijiji loved her and
that even though she did not love the war chief of the Be-don-ko-he
he would protect her from injury if he could.</p>

<p>He recalled how Shoz-Dijiji had struck the whiskey from his hand
the previous day; he felt the blows upon his face as Shoz-Dijiji
slapped him; he burned at recollection of the indignities that had
been: put upon him before the eyes of the white-eyed man; but he
kept on in the direction of the Be-don-ko-he camp.</p>

<p>They say that an Apache is never moved by chivalry or
loyalty&mdash;only by self-interest; but this day Gian-nah-tah gave
the lie to the author of this calumny.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>As Wichita Billings was about to pass the mouth of Pimos Canyon
she heard the sound of galloping hoofs behind her. In effete
society it is not considered proper for a young lady to turn and
scrutinize chance wayfarers upon the same road; but the society of
Arizona in the '80's was young and virile&mdash;so young and so
virile that it behooved one to investigate it before it arrived
within shooting distance.</p>

<p>Impelled, therefore, by a deep regard for Nature's first law
Wichita turned in her saddle and examined the approaching horsemen.
Instantly she saw that they were five and white. It occurred to her
that perhaps they had seen her pass and were coming to warn her
that Geronimo was out, for she knew that word of it would have
passed quickly throughout the country.</p>

<p>As the riders neared she thought that she recognized something
vaguely familiar in the figure and carriage of one of them, for in
a country where people go much upon horseback individual
idiosyncrasies of seat and form are quickly and easily observable
and often serve to identify a rider at considerable distances.</p>

<p>Cheetim rode with an awkward forward hunch and his right elbow
higher than his left. It was by these that Wichita recognized him
even before she saw his face; though she was naturally inclined to
doubt her own judgment, since she had believed "Dirty" Cheetim dead
for several years.</p>

<p>An instant later she discerned his whiskered face. While she did
not know that these men were pursuing her, she was quite confident
that there would be trouble the instant that Cheetim recognized
her; and so she spurred on at a faster gait, intending to keep
ahead of the five without actually seeming to be fleeing them.</p>

<p>But that was to be more easily planned than executed, for the
instant that she increased her speed they spurred after her at a
run, shouting to her to stop. She heard them call that Geronimo was
out, but she was more afraid of Cheetim than she was of
Geronimo.</p>

<p>So insistent were they upon overtaking her that presently her
horse was extended at full speed, but as it is seldom that a horse
that excels in one gait is proportionally swift at others it was
soon apparent that she would be overhauled.</p>

<p>Leaning forward along her horse's neck, she touched him again
with her spurs and spoke encouraging words in his back-laid ears.
The incentive of spur and spoken word, the lesser wind resistance
of her new position, had their effects with the result that for a
short time she drew away from her pursuers; but presently the young
cow-puncher, plying long rowels, wielding pliant, rawhide quirt
that fell with stinging blows alternately upon either flank of his
wiry mount, edged closer.</p>

<p>"Hold on, Miss!" he called to her. "You gotta come
back&mdash;Geronimo's out!"</p>

<p>"You go back and tell 'Dirty' Cheetim to lay off," she shouted
back over her shoulder. "If I've got to choose between him and
Geronimo, I'll take the Apache."</p>

<p>"You better stop and talk to him," he urged. "He ain't goin' to
hurt you none."</p>

<p>"You're damn tootin' cow-boy," she yelled at him; "he sure ain't
if I know it."</p>

<p>The young puncher urged his horse to greater speed. Wichita's
mount was weakening. The man drew closer. In a moment he would be
able to reach out and seize her bridle rein. The two had far
outdistanced the others trailing in the dust behind.</p>

<p>Wichita drew her six-shooter. "Be careful, cow-boy!" she warned.
"I aint got nothin' agin you, but I'll shore bore you if you lay
ary hand on this bridle."</p>

<p>Easily Wichita lapsed into the vernacular she had spent three
years trying to forget, as she always and unconsciously did under
stress of excitement.</p>

<p>"Then I'll run that cayuse o' yourn ragged," threatened the man.
"He's just about all in how."</p>

<p>"Yours is!" snapped Wichita, levelling her six-shooter at the
horse of her pursuer and pulling the trigger.</p>
<a id="pic2" name="pic2"><!--Image Anchor--></a><br>

<div align="center"><img src="0300271h-images/ApacheDevil-02.jpg"
alt="Illustration" title="Illustration">
<p class="caption">Wichita levelled her six-shooter at the horse of
her pursuer.</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>The man uttered an oath and tried to rein in to avoid the shot.
Wichita's hammer fell with a futile click. She pulled the trigger
again and again with the same result. The man voiced a loud guffaw
and closed up again. The girl turned her horse to one side to avoid
him. Again he came on in the new direction; and when he was almost
upon her she brought her mount to its haunches, wheeled suddenly
and spurred across the trail to the rear of the man and rode on
again at right angles to her former direction, but she had widened
the distance between them.</p>

<p>Once more the chase began, but now the man had taken down his
rope and was shaking out the noose. He drew closer. Standing in his
stirrups, swinging the great noose, he waited for the right
instant. Wichita tried to turn away from him but she saw that he
would win that way as easily, since she was turning back toward the
other four who were already preparing to intercept her.</p>

<p>Her horse was heavier than the pony ridden by the young puncher
and that fact gave Wichita a forlorn hope. Wheeling, she spurred
straight toward the man with the mad intention of riding him down.
If her own horse did not fall too, she might still have a
chance.</p>

<p>The puncher sensed instantly the thing that was in her mind; and
just before the impact he drove his spurs deep into his pony's
sides, and as Wichita's horse passed behind him he dropped his
noose deftly to the rear over his left shoulder, and an instant
later had drawn it tight about the neck of the girl's mount.</p>

<p>She reached forward and tried to throw off the rope, but the
puncher backed away, keeping it taut; and then "Dirty" Cheetim and
the three others closed in about her.</p>

<br>

<h2><a name="chap5" id="chap5">V. &mdash; THE SNAKE LOOK</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">GIAN-NAH-TAH entered the hogan of Shoz-Dijiji. The
young war chief, awakening instantly, sprang to his feet when he
saw who it was standing in the opening.</p>

<p>"Does Gian-nah-tah come to the hogan of Shoz-Dijiji as friend or
enemy?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Listen, Shoz-Dijiji, and you will know," replied Gian-nah-tah.
"Yesterday my heart was bad. Perhaps the fire-water of the
white-eyed man made it so, but it is not of that that Gian-nah-tah
has come to speak with Shoz-Dijiji. It is of the girl,
Wichita."</p>

<p>"Shoz-Dijiji does not wish to speak of her," replied the war
chief.</p>

<p>"But he will listen while Gian-nah-tah speaks," said the other,
peremptorily. "The white-eyed skunk that sells poisoned water has
ridden with four of his braves to capture the white-eyed girl that
Shoz-Dijiji loves," continued Gian-nah-tah. "They follow her to
Pimos Canyon, and there they will keep her in the hogan that the
white fool with the strange clothing built there six summers ago.
Shoz-Dijiji knows the place?"</p>

<p>The Black Bear did not reply. Instead he seized the cartridge
belt to which his six-shooter hung and buckled it about his slim
hips, took his rifle, his hackamore, ran quickly out in search of
his hobbled pony.</p>

<p>Gian-nah-tah hastened to his own hogan for weapons. Warriors,
eating their breakfasts, noted the haste of the two and questioned
them. Nervous, restless, apprehensive of the results that might
follow Geronimo's departure from the reservation, smarting under
the injustice of the white-eyed men in taking their herds from
them, many of the braves welcomed any diversion, especially one
that might offer an outlet to their pent wrath against the enemy;
and so it was that by the time Shoz-Dijiji had found and bridled
Nejeunee he discovered that instead of riding alone to the rescue
of the white girl he was one of a dozen savage warriors.</p>

<p>Wrapped in blankets they rode slowly, decorously, until they had
passed beyond the ken of captious white eyes, six-shooters and
rifles hidden beneath the folds of their blankets; then the
blankets fell away, folded lengthways across the withers of their
ponies, and a dozen warriors, naked but for G strings, quirted
their ponies into swinging lope.</p>

<p>Knowing that the troops were out, the Indians followed no beaten
road but rode south across the Gila and then turned southeast
through the hills toward Pimos Canyon.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>"Dirty" Cheetim, with a lead rope on Wichita's horse, rode
beside the girl.</p>

<p>"Thought you was too high-toned for 'Dirty' Cheetim, eh?" he
sneered. "You was too damn good to be Mrs. Cheetim, eh? Well, you
ain't a-goin' to be Mrs. Cheetim. You're just a-goin' to be one o'
'Dirty' Cheetim's girls down at the Hog Ranch. Nobody don't marry
them."</p>

<p>Wichita Billings made no reply. She rode in silence, her eyes
straight to the front.</p>

<p>Hicks, the young puncher who had roped the girl's horse, rode a
few paces to the rear. In his drink muddled brain doubts were
forming as to the propriety of the venture into which Cheetim had
led him. Perhaps he was more fool than knave; perhaps, sober, he
might have balked at the undertaking. After all he was but half
conscious of vaguely annoying questionings that might eventually
have crystallized into regrets had time sufficed, but it did
not.</p>

<p>They were winding up Pimos Canyon toward the deserted shack.
"Your old man kicked me out," Cheetim was saying to the girl. "I
reckon you're thinking that he'll get me for this, but he won't.
After you bin to the Ranch a spell you won't be advertising to your
old man, nor nobody else, where you be. They's other girls there as
good as you be, an' they ain't none of 'em sendin' out invites to
their folks to come an' see 'em. You&mdash;Hell! Look! Injuns!"</p>

<p>Over the western rim of Pimos Canyon a dozen yelling Apaches
were charging down the steep hillside.</p>

<p>"Geronimo!" screamed Cheetim and, dropping the lead rope,
wheeled about and bolted down the canyon as fast as spur and quirt
and horse flesh could carry him.</p>

<p>The four remaining men opened fire on the Apaches, and in the
first exchange of shots two had their horses shot from under them.
Hicks' horse, grazed by a bullet, became unmanageable and started
off down the canyon after Cheetim's animal, pitching and squealing,
while a third man, realizing the futility of resistance and
unhampered by sentiments of chivalry, put spur and followed.</p>

<p>One of the dismounted men ran to the side of Wichita's horse,
seized her arm and dragged her from the saddle before she realized
the thing that was in his mind; then, vaulting to the horse's back,
he started after his fellows while the girl ran to the shelter of a
boulder behind which the sole remaining white man had taken up a
position from which he might momentarily, at least, wage a hopeless
defense against the enemy.</p>

<p>Shoz-Dijiji and Gian-nah-tah, racing toward the girl, saw her
dragged from her horse, saw her take refuge behind the boulder, and
the latter, knowing that the girl was safe, raced after the white
man who had stolen her horse and left her, as he thought, to the
merciless attentions of a savage enemy.</p>

<p>Shoz-Dijiji, calling his warriors together, circled away from
the boulder behind which the two were crouching. The white man
looked from behind the boulder. Slowly he raised his rifle to take
aim. The girl raised her eyes above the level of the boulder's top.
She saw the Apache warriors gathered a hundred yards away, she saw
the rifle of the white man leveled upon them, and then she
recognized Shoz-Dijiji.</p>

<p>"Don't shoot!" she cried to her companion. "Wait!"</p>

<p>"Wait, hell!" scoffed the man. "We ain't got no more chanct than
a snowball in Hell. Why should I wait?"</p>

<p>"One of those Indians is friendly," replied the girl. "I don't
think he'll hurt us or let the others hurt us when he knows I'm
here."</p>

<p><br>
Gian-nah-tah, riding fast, had pulled alongside his quarry. With
clubbed rifle he knocked the white man from the saddle and in a
dozen more strides had seized the bridle rein of the riderless
horse.</p>

<p>The man behind the boulder drew a fine sight on the buck who
appeared to be the leader of the renegades. It was Shoz-Dijiji.
Wichita Billings snatched the white man's six-shooter from its
holster and shoved the muzzle against his side.</p>

<p>"Drop that gun!" she cautioned; "or I'll bore you."</p>

<p>The man lowered his rifle to the accompaniment of lurid
profanity.</p>

<p>"Shut up," admonished Wichita, "and look there!"</p>

<p>Shoz-Dijiji had tied a white rag to the muzzle of his rifle and
was waving it to and fro above his head. Wichita stood up and waved
a hand above her head.</p>

<p>"Stand up!" she commanded, addressing the white man behind the
boulder. The fellow did as he was bid and, again at her command,
accompanied her as she advanced to meet Shoz-Dijiji, who was
walking toward them alone. As they met, the Black Bear seized the
white man's rifle and wrenched it from his grasp.</p>

<p>"Now I kill him," he announced.</p>

<p>"No! Oh, no!" cried Wichita, stepping between them.</p>

<p>"Why not?" demanded Shoz-Dijiji. "He steal you, eh?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but you mustn't kill him," replied the girl. "He came
forward under the protection of your white flag."</p>

<p>"White flag for you&mdash;not for dirty coyote," the Black Bear
assured her. "I give him his rifle, then. Him go back. Then I get
him."</p>

<p>"No, Shoz-Dijiji, you must let him go. He doesn't deserve it,
I'll admit; but it would only bring trouble to you and your people.
The troops are already out after Geronimo. If there is a killing
here there is no telling what it will lead to."</p>

<p>"No sabe white-eyed men," said Shoz-Dijiji disgustedly. "Kill
good Indian, yes; kill bad white-eye, no." He shrugged. "Well, you
say no kill, no kill." He turned to the white man. "Get out,
pronto! You sabe? Get out San Carlos. Shoz-Dijiji see you San
Carlos again, kill. Get!"</p>

<p>"Gimme my rifle and six-gun," growled the white, sullenly.</p>

<p>Shoz-Dijiji laid his hand on Wichita's arm as she was about to
return the man's six-shooter. "Shut up, and hit the trail, white
man," he snapped.</p>

<p>The other hesitated a moment, as though about to speak, looked
into the savage face of the Apache, and then started down Pimos
Canyon toward the main trail just as Gian-nah-tah rode up leading
the girl's horse.</p>

<p>"Gian-nah-tah," said the Black Bear, "Shoz-Dijiji, the
Be-don-ko-he Apache, rides with the white-eyed girl to the hogan of
her father to see that she is not harmed by white-eyed men upon the
way." There was the trace of a smile in the eyes of the Indian as
he spoke. "Perhaps," he continued, "Gian-nah-tah will ride to the
camp of my father and tell him that Nan-tan-des-la-par-en has sent
troops toward the south to bring Geronimo in, dead or alive.</p>

<p>"When the white-eyed girl is safe Shoz-Dijiji will join his
father. Perhaps other Apache warriors will join him. Who knows,
Gian-nah-tah?"</p>

<p>"I shall join him," said Gian-nah-tah.</p>

<p>The other warriors, who had slowly drawn near, had overheard the
conversation and now, without exception, each assured Shoz-Dijiji
that he would join Geronimo at once or later.</p>

<p>As Wichita mounted her horse and looked about her at the half
circle of savage warriors partially surrounding her it seemed
incredible that yesterday these men were, and perhaps again
tomorrow would be, the cruel, relentless devils of the Apache
war-trail.</p>

<p>Now they were laughing among themselves and poking fun at the
white man plodding down the canyon and at the other whom
Gian-nah-tah had knocked from Wichita's horse and who was already
regaining consciousness and looking about him in a dazed and
foolish manner.</p>

<p>It seemed incredible that she should be safe among them when she
had been in such danger but a moment before among men of her own
race. Many of them smiled pleasantly at her as she tried to thank
them for what they had done for her; and they waved friendly hands
in adieu as they rode off with Gian-nah-tah toward the north,
leaving her alone with Shoz-Dijiji.</p>

<p>"How can I ever thank you, Shoz-Dijiji?" she said. "You are the
most wonderful friend that a girl could have."</p>

<p>The war chief of the Be-don-ko-he looked her straight in the
eyes and grunted.</p>

<p>"Me no sabe," he said, and wheeled his pinto down toward the
main trail, beckoning her to follow.</p>

<p>Wichita Billings looked at the man at her side in astonishment.
She opened her lips to speak, again but thought better of it and
remained silent. They passed the two habitues of the Hog Ranch
trudging disgustedly through the dust. The Apache did not even
deign to look at them. They came to the main trail, and here
Shoz-Dijiji turned southeast in the direction of the Billings
ranch. San Carlos lay to the northwest. Wichita drew rein.</p>

<p>"You may go back to the reservation," she said. "I shall be safe
now the rest of the way home."</p>

<p>Shoz-Dijiji looked at her. "Come!" he said, and rode on toward
the southeast.</p>

<p>Wichita did not move. "I shall not let you ride with me," she
said. "I appreciate what you have done for me, but I cannot permit
myself to be put under further obligations to you."</p>

<p>"Come!" said Shoz-Dijiji, peremptorily. Wichita felt a slow
flush mounting her cheek, and it embarrassed and angered her.</p>

<p>"I'll sit here forever," she said, "before I'll let you ride
home with me."</p>

<p>Shoz-Dijiji reined Nejeunee about and rode back to her side. He
took hold of her bridle rein and started leading her horse in the
direction he wished it to go.</p>

<p>For an instant Wichita Billings was furious. Very seldom in her
life had she been crossed. Being an only child in a motherless home
she had had her own way more often than not. People had a habit of
doing the things that Wichita Billings wanted done. In a way she
was spoiled and, too, she had a bit of a temper. Shoz-Dijiji had
humiliated her and now he was attempting to coerce her. Her eyes
flashed fire as she swung her heavy quirt above her head and
brought it down across the man's naked shoulders.</p>

<p>"Let go of my bridle, you&mdash;" but there she stopped,
horrified at what she had done. "Oh, Shoz-Dijiji! How could I?" she
cried, and burst into tears.</p>

<p>The Apache gave no sign that he had felt the stinging blow, but
the ugly welt that rose across his back testified to the force with
which the lash had fallen.</p>

<p>As though realizing that she had capitulated the Apache dropped
her bridle rein; and Wichita rode on docilely at his side, dabbing
at her eyes and nose with her handkerchief and struggling to
smother an occasional sob.</p>

<p>Thus in silence they rode as mile after mile of the dusty trail
unrolled behind them. Often the girl glanced at the rugged,
granitic profile of the savage warrior at her side and wondered
what was passing through the brain behind that inscrutable mask.
Sometimes she looked at the welt across his shoulders and caught
her breath to stifle a new sob.</p>

<p>They were approaching the Billings ranch now. In a few minutes
Wichita would be home. She knew what Shoz-Dijiji would do. He would
turn and ride away without a word.</p>

<p>Battling with her pride, which was doubly strong because it was
composed of both the pride of the white and the pride of the woman,
she gave in at last and spoke to him again.</p>

<p>"Can you forgive me, Shoz-Dijiji?" she asked. "It was my ugly
temper that did it, not my heart."</p>

<p>"You only think that," he said, presently. "The thing that is
deep down in your heart, deep in the heart of every white, came out
when you lost control of yourself through anger. If Shoz-Dijiji had
been white you would not have struck him!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Shoz-Dijiji, how can you say such a thing?" she cried.
"There is no white man in the world that I respect more than I do
you."</p>

<p>"That is a lie," said the Apache, quite simply. "It is not
possible for a white-eyes to respect an Apache. Sometimes they
think they do, perhaps, but let something happen to make them lose
their tempers and the truth rises sure and straight, like a smoke
signal after a storm."</p>

<p>"I do not lie to you&mdash;you should not say such a thing to
me," the girl reproached.</p>

<p>"You lie to yourself, not to me; for you only try to deceive
yourself. In that, perhaps, you succeed; but you do not deceive me.
Shoz-Dijiji knows&mdash;you tell him yourself, though you do not
mean to. Shoz-Dijiji will finish the words you started when you
struck him with your quirt, and then you will understand what
Shoz-Dijiji understands: 'Let go of my bridle, you&mdash;dirty
Siwash!'"</p>

<p>Wichita gasped. "Oh, I didn't say that!" she cried.</p>

<p>"It was in your heart. The Apache knows." There was no rancor in
his voice.</p>

<p>"Oh, Shoz-Dijiji, I <i>couldn't</i> say that to you&mdash;I
couldn't mean it. Can't you see that I couldn't?"</p>

<p>They had reached the ranch gate and stopped. "Listen," said the
Apache. "Shoz-Dijiji saw the look in the white girl's eyes when he
kissed her. Shoz-Dijiji has seen that look in the eyes of white
women when a snake touched them. Shoz-Dijiji understands!"</p>

<p>"You do not understand!" cried the girl. "God! you do not
understand anything."</p>

<p>"Shoz-Dijiji understands that white girl is for white
man&mdash;Apache for Apache. If not, you would not have looked that
way when Shoz-Dijiji took you in his arms. Cheetim wanted you. He
is a white man." There was a trace of bitterness in his tone. "Why
did not you go with him? He is no Apache to bring the snake-look to
your eyes."</p>

<p>The girl was about to reply when they were interrupted by the
sound of a gruff voice and looking up saw Billings striding angrily
toward them.</p>

<p>"Get in here, Chita!" he ordered, roughly, and then turned to
Shoz-Dijiji. "What the hell do you want?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Father!" exclaimed the girl. "This is my friend. You have no
right&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No dirty, sneaking, murdering Siwash can hang around my ranch,"
shouted Billings angrily. "Now get the hell out of here and stay
out!"</p>

<p>Shoz-Dijiji, apparently unmoved, looked the white man in the
eyes. "She my friend," he said. "I come when I please."</p>

<p>Billings' fairly danced about in rage. "If I catch you around
here again," he spluttered, "I'll put a bullet in you where it'll
do the most good."</p>

<p>"Pindah-lickoyee," said the Apache, "you make big talk to a war
chief of the Be-don-ko-he. When Shoz-Dijiji comes again, then
may-be-so you not talk so big about bullets any more," and wheeling
his little pinto stallion, about he rode away.</p>

<p>Attracted by the loud voice of Billings a cow-hand, loitering
near the bunkhouse, had walked down to the gate, arriving just as
Shoz-Dijiji left.</p>

<p>"Say," he drawled, "why that there's the Injun that give me
water that time an' tol' me how to git here."</p>

<p>"So he's the damn skunk wot stole the ewe-neck roan!" exclaimed
Billings.</p>

<p>"Yes," snapped Wichita, angrily, "and he's the 'damn skunk' that
saved Luke's life that time. He's the 'damn skunk' that kept
'Dirty' Cheetim from gettin' me three years ago. He's the 'damn
skunk' that saved me from Tats-ah-das-ay-go down at the Pringe
ranch. He's the 'damn skunk' that heard this mornin' that Cheetim
was after me again with a bunch of his bums and rode down to Pimos
Canyon from San Carlos and took me away from them and brought me
home. You ought to be damn proud o' yourself, Dad!"</p>

<p>Billings looked suddenly crestfallen and Luke Jensen very much
embarrassed. He had never heard the boss talked to like this
before, and he wished he had stayed at the bunkhouse where he
belonged.</p>

<p>"I'm damned sorry," said Billings after a moment of silence. "If
I see that Apache again I'll tell him so, but ever since they got
poor Mason I see red every time I drops my eyes on one of 'em. I'm
shore sorry, Chita."</p>

<p>"He won't ever know it," said the girl. "Shoz-Dijiji won't ever
come back again."</p>

<h2><a name="chap6" id="chap6">VI. &mdash; THE WAR TRAIL</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">SHOZ-DIJIJI, riding cross-country, picked up the
trail of Geronimo where it lay revealed to Apache eyes like a
printed message across the open pages of Nature's book of
hieroglyphs, and in the evening of the second day he came to the
camp of the War Chief.</p>

<p>Gian-nah-tah and several of the warriors who had accompanied
Shoz-Dijiji in the pursuit of Cheetim and his unsavory company were
already with Geronimo, and during the next two days other warriors
and many women came silent footed into the camp of the
Be-don-ko-he.</p>

<p>The Apaches were nervous and irritable. They knew that troops
were out after them, and though the cunning of Shoz-Dijiji had sent
the first contingent upon a wild goose chase toward Sonora the
Indians were well aware that it could be but a matter of days
before their whereabouts might be discovered and other troops sent
to arrest them.</p>

<p>Among those that urged upon them the necessity of immediately
taking the war trail was Mangas, son of the great dead chief,
Mangas Colorado; but Geronimo held back. He did not wish to fight
the white men again, for he realized, perhaps better than any of
them, the futility of continued resistance; but there were two
forces opposing him that were to prove more potent than the
conservatism of mature deliberation. They were Sago-zhu-ni, the
wife of Mangas, and the tizwin she was brewing. It was in the early
evening of May 16, 1885 that Shoz-Dijiji rode into the camp of
Geronimo. The sacred hoddentin had been offered up with the prayers
to evening, and already the Be-don-ko-he had gathered about the
council fire. Tizwin was flowing freely as was evidenced by the
increasing volubility of the orators.</p>

<p>Mangas spoke forcefully and definitely for war, urging it upon
Na-chi-ta, son of old Cochise and chief of the Chihuicahui Apaches
and ranking chief of all those gathered in the camp of Geronimo;
but Na-chi-ta, good-natured, fonder of tizwin and pretty squaws
than he was of the war-trail and its hardships, argued, though
half-heartedly, for peace.</p>

<p>Chihuahua, his fine head bowed in thought, nodded his approval
of the moderate counsel of Na-chi-ta; and when it was his turn to
speak he reminded them of the waste of war, of the uselessness and
hopelessness of fighting against the soldiers of the white men; and
old Nanay sided with him; but Ulzanna, respected for his ferocity
and his intelligence, spoke for war, as did Kut-le, the bravest of
them all.</p>

<p>Stinging from the insults of the father of Wichita Billings,
Shoz-Dijiji was filled with bitterness against all whites; and when
Kut-le had spoken, the young war chief of the Be-don-ko-he
arose.</p>

<p>"Geronimo, my father," he said, "speaks with great wisdom and
out of years filled with experience, but perhaps he has forgotten
many things that have happened during the long years that the
Shis-Inday have been fighting to drive the enemy from the country
that Usen made for them. Shoz-Dijiji, the son of Geronimo, has not
forgotten the things that he has seen, nor those of which his
father has told him; they are burned into his memory.</p>

<p>"Geronimo is right when he says that peace is better than war
for those who may no longer hope to win, and I too would speak
against the war-trail if the pindah-lickoyee would leave us in
peace to live our own lives as Usen taught us to live them. But
they will not. They wish us to live in their way which is not a
good way for Apaches to live. If we do not wish to, they send
soldiers and arrest us. Thus we are prisoners and slaves.
Shoz-Dijiji cannot be happy either as a prisoner or as a slave, and
so he prefers the war-trail and death to these things.</p>

<p>"Na-chi-ta speaks against the war-trail because there will be no
tizwin there but, instead, many hardships."</p>

<p>Shoz-Dijiji knew well the great Cochise, father of Na-chi-ta.
Cochise would be angry and ashamed if he could have heard his son
speak at the council fire tonight.</p>

<p>"Chihuahua speaks against war. Chihuahua thinks only of the
little farm that the pindah-lickoyee are permitting him to use and
forgets all the wide expanse of country that the pindah-lickoyee
have stolen from him. Chihuahua is a brave warrior. I do not think
that Chihuahua will long be happy working like a slave for the
Indian Agent who will rob him of the sweat of his brow as he robs
us all.</p>

<p>"Nanay is old and lives in memories of past war, trails when he
fought with glory at the side of Victorio and Loco; his day is
done, his life has been lived. Why should we young men, who have
our own lives to live, be content to live upon the memories of old
men. We want memories of our own and freedom, if only for a short
time, to enjoy them as our fathers did before us.</p>

<p>"Ulzanna and Kut-le are brave men. They do honor to the proud
race from which we all spring. They know that it would be better to
die in freedom upon the war-trail against the hated pindah-lickoyee
than to live like cattle, herded upon a reservation by the
white-eyes.</p>

<p>"They think of the great warriors, of the women, of the little
children who have been murdered by the lies and treachery of the
pindah-lickoyee. They recall the ridicule that is heaped upon all
those things which we hold most sacred. They do not forget the
insults that every white-eyed man hurls at the Shis-Inday upon
every occasion except when the Shis-Inday are on the war trail.
Then they respect us.</p>

<p>"Shall we wait here until they come and arrest and kill our
chiefs, as Nan-tan-des-la-par-en has ordered them to do, or shall
we take to the war trail and teach them once more to respect us? I,
Shoz-Dijiji, war chief of the Be-don-ko-he, speak for the war
trail. I have spoken."</p>

<p>An old man arose. "Let us wait," he said. "Perhaps the soldiers
of the pindah-lickoyee will not come. Perhaps they will let us live
in peace if we do not go upon the war trail. Let us wait." The
tizwin had not as yet spoken its final word, and there were more
who spoke against the war trail than for it, and before the council
was concluded many had spoken. Among the last was Sago-zhu-ni
Pretty Mouth&mdash;the wife of Mangas, for the voice of woman was
not unknown about the council fires of the Apaches. And why should
it be? Did not they share all the hardships of the war trail with
their lords and masters? Did they not often fight, and as fiercely
and terribly as the men? Were they not as often the targets for the
rifles of the pindah-lickoyee? Who, then, had better right to speak
at the councils of the Apaches than the wives and mothers of their
warriors.</p>

<p>Sago-zhu-ni spoke briefly, but to the point. "Are you men, old
women, or children?" she cried fiercely. "If you are old women and
children, you will stay here and wait to receive your punishment;
but if you are warriors, you will take, the war trail, and then
Nan-tan-des-la-par-en must catch you before he can punish you.
May-be-so, you go to Sonora, he no catch you. I have spoken."</p>

<p>Now Na-chi-ta, encouraged by tizwin and goaded by the reproaches
of Shoz-Dijiji, spoke for war. Geronimo, his savage brain inflamed
by the fumes of the drink, applauded Sago-zhu-ni and demanded the
blood of every pindah-lickoyee.</p>

<p>With fiery eloquence he ranged back through the history of the
Shis-Inday for more than three hundred years and reminded them of
every wrong that white men had committed against them in all that
time. He spoke for more than an hour, and while he spoke
Sago-zhu-ni saw that no warrior suffered from lack of tizwin. Of
all who spoke vehemently for the war trail Shoz-Dijiji alone spoke
out of a clear mind, or at least a mind unclouded by the fumes of
drink, though it was dark with bitter hatred and prejudice.</p>

<p>When Geronimo sat down they voted unanimously for the war trail;
and the next morning they broke camp and headed south-thirty-four
warriors, eight boys, and ninety-one women. Hair was slicked down
with tallow, swart faces streaked with war paint, weapons looked
to. Hoddentin was sprinkled on many a tzi-daltai of lightning riven
pine or cedar or fir as copper warriors prayed to these amulets for
protection against the bullets of the pindah-lickoyee, for success
upon the war trail.</p>

<p>Shoz-Dijiji, with Gian-nah-tah and two other warriors, rode in
advance of the main party, scouting far afield, scanning the
distances from every eminence. No creature stirred in the broad
landscape before them that was not marked by those eagle eyes, no
faintest spoor beneath their feet was passed unnoted.</p>

<p>The young war chief of the Be-don-ko-he was again the Apache
Devil. His face was painted blue but for the broad band of white
across his eyes from temple to temple; around his head was wound a
vivid yellow bandana upon the front of which was fastened a silver
disc in the center of which was mounted a single turquoise; small
rings of silver, from each of which depended another of these
valued gems, swung from the lobes of his ears; other bits of this
prized duklij were strung in the yard-long necklace of glass beads
and magical berries and roots that fell across the front of his
brown, print shirt, which, with his heavy buckskin war moccasins
and his G string, completed his apparel.</p>

<p>About his waist and across one shoulder were belts filled with
ammunition for the revolver at his hip and the rifle lying across
the withers of Nejeunee, and at his left side hung a pair of
powerful field glasses that he had taken in battle from a cavalry
officer several years before. From below the skirts of his shirt to
the tops of his moccasins the Apache Devil's bronzed legs were
naked, as he seldom if ever wore the cotton drawers affected by
many of his fellows. The bracelets of silver and brass that adorned
his muscular arms were hidden by the sleeves of his shirt, a shirt
that he probably soon would discard, being ever impatient of the
confining sensation that clothing imparted.</p>

<p>Down into the mountains of southwestern New Mexico the Apaches
marched, following trails known only to themselves, passing
silently through danger zones by night, and established themselves
among caves and canyons inaccessible to mounted troops.</p>

<p>Striking swiftly, raiding parties descended upon many an
isolated ranch house both in Arizona and New Mexico, leaving behind
horrid evidence of their ferocity as they rode away upon stolen
horses from the blazing funeral pyres that had once been homes.</p>

<p>Scouts kept Geronimo informed of the location of the troops in
the field against him; and the shrewd old war chief successfully
avoided encounters with any considerable body of enemy forces, but
scouting parties and supply trains often felt the full force of the
strategy and courage of this master general of guerrilla warfare
and his able lieutenants.</p>

<p>It was during these days that the blue and white face of the
Apache Devil became as well known and as feared as it was in Sonora
and Chihuahua, for, though relentless in his war against the men of
the pindah-lickoyee, Shoz-Dijiji killed neither women nor children,
with the result that there were often survivors to describe the
boldness and ferocity of his attacks.</p>

<p>Scouting far north for information relative to the movement of
troops, Shoz-Dijiji one day came upon an Indian scout in the employ
of the enemy; and having recognized him as an old friend he hailed
him.</p>

<p>"Where are the soldiers of the pindah-lickoyee?" demanded
Shoz-Dijiji.</p>

<p>"They cannot catch you," replied the scout, grinning, "and so
they are sending Apaches after you. Behind me are a hundred White
Mountain and Cho-kon-en braves. They are led by one white-eyed
officer, Captain Crawford. Tell Geronimo that he had better come
in, for he cannot escape the Shis-Inday as he has escaped the
pindah-lickoyee."</p>

<p>"Why do you and the others go upon the war trail against your
own people?" demanded Shoz-Dijiji. "Why do you fight as brothers at
the side of the enemy?"</p>

<p>"We take the war trail against you because you are fools and we
are not," replied the scout. "We have learned that it is useless to
fight against the pindah-lickoyee. We do not love them more than
you; and if we could kill them all we would, but we cannot kill
them all&mdash;they are as many as the weeds that grow among our
corn and beans and pumpkins&mdash;for though we cut them down they
come again in greater numbers than before, flourishing best in soil
that is wet with blood.</p>

<p>"When you go upon the war trail against the white-eyed men it
only makes more trouble for us. Geronimo is a great trouble maker.
Therefore we fight against him that we may live in peace."</p>

<p>"Either your mouth is full of lies or your heart has turned to
water," said Shoz-Dijiji. "No Apache wants peace at the price of
slavery, unless he has become a coward and is afraid of the
pindah-lickoyee. Shoz-Dijiji has the guts of a man. He would rather
die on the war trail than be a reservation Indian. You have not
even the guts of a coyote, which snarls and snaps at the hand of
his captor and risks death to regain his freedom."</p>

<p>"Be a coyote then," sneered the scout, "and I will put your pelt
on the floor of my hogan."</p>

<p>"Here it is, reservation Indian," replied the Black Bear. "Take
it."</p>

<p>Both men had dismounted when they met and were standing close
and face to face. The scout reached quickly for his six-shooter,
but the Apache Devil was even quicker. His left hand shot out and
seized the other's wrist, and with his right he drew from its
scabbard the great butcher knife that hung at his hip.</p>

<p>The scout warded the first blow and grasped Shoz-Dijiji's arm;
and at the same instant tore his right arm free, but as he did so
the renegade snatched the other's gun from its holster and tossed
it aside, while the scout, profiting by the momentary freedom of
his right hand, drew his own knife, and the two closed in a clinch,
each striving to drive his blade home in the body of his
adversary.</p>

<p>At the time that their altercation had reached the point of
physical encounter each of the men had dropped his hackamore rope
with the result that Shoz-Dijiji's horse, recently stolen from a
raided ranch, took advantage of this God-given opportunity to make
a break for freedom and home, while the scout's pony, lured by the
call of consanguinity, trotted off with the deserter.</p>

<p>Each of the combatants now held the knife-arm of the other and
the struggle had resolved itself into one of strength and
endurance, since he who could hold his grip the longer stood the
greater chance for victory, the other the almost certain assurance
of death.</p>

<p>They struggled to and fro, pushing one another here and there
about the sandy dust of a parched canyon bottom. The painted face
of the Apache Devil remained almost expressionless, so well
schooled in inscrutability were his features, nor did that of the
scout indicate that he was engaged in a duel to the death.</p>

<p>Two miles to the north a detachment of twenty White Mountain
Apaches from Crawford's Indian Scouts were following leisurely
along the trail of their comrade. In twenty minutes, perhaps, they
would come within sight of the scene of the duel.</p>

<p>It is possible that the scout engaged with Shoz-Dijiji held this
hope in mind, for when it became obvious to him that he was no
match in physical strength for his adversary he dropped his own
knife and grasped the knife arm of his foe in both hands.</p>

<p>It was a foolish move, for no sooner did the Apache Devil regain
the freedom of his left hand than he transferred his weapon to it
and before his unfortunate antagonist realized his danger
Shoz-Dijiji plunged the blade between his ribs, deep into his
heart.</p>

<p>Stooping over the body of his dead foe Shoz-Dijiji tore the red
band that proclaimed the government scout from his brow and with a
deft movement of his knife removed a patch of scalp. Then he
appropriated the ammunition and weapons of his late adversary and
turned to look for the two ponies. Now, for the first time, he
realized that they were gone and that he was afoot far from the
camp of Geronimo, probably the sole possessor of the information
that a hundred scouts were moving upon the stronghold of the War
Chief.</p>

<p>A white man might doubtless have been deeply chagrined had he
found himself in a similar position, but to the Apache it meant
only a little physical exertion to which he was already inured by a
lifetime of training. The country through which he might pass on
foot by the most direct route to Geronimo's camp was practically
impassable to horses but might be covered by an Apache in less time
than it would have required to make the necessary detours on
horseback. However, Shoz-Dijiji would have preferred the easier
method of transportation, and so he regretted that he had ridden
the new pony instead of Nejeunee, who would not have run away from
him.</p>

<p>Knowing that other scouts might be near at hand, Shoz-Dijiji
placed an ear to the ground and was rewarded by information that
sent him quickly toward the south. Clambering up the side of the
canyon, he adjusted the red band of the dead scout about his own
head as he climbed, for he knew that eyes fully as keen as his own
were doubtless scanning the horizon through powerful field glasses
at no great distance and that if they glimpsed the red band they
would not hasten in pursuit.</p>

<p>He grinned as he envisaged the anger of the scouts when they
came upon the dead body of their scalped comrade, and the vision
lightened the dreary hours as he trotted southward beneath the
pitiless sun of New Mexico.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon Shoz-Dijiji approached a main trail that
led west to Fort Bowie and which he must cross, but with the
caution of the Apache he reconnoitred first.</p>

<p>From the top of a low hill the trail was in sight for a mile or
two in each direction and to this vantage point the Black Bear
crept. Only his eyes and the top of his head were raised above the
summit of the hill, and these were screened by a small bush that he
had torn from the ground and which he held just in front of him as
he wormed his way to the hilltop.</p>

<p>Below him the trail led through a defile in which lay scattered
huge fragments of rock among which the feed grew thick and rank,
suggesting water close beneath the surface; but it was not these
things that caught the eyes and interest of the Apache Devil, who
was already as familiar with them as he was with countless other
square miles of New Mexico, Arizona, Chihuahua, and Sonora, or with
the wrinkles upon the face of his mother, Sons-ee-ah-ray.</p>

<p>That which galvanized his instant attention and interest was a
cavalryman sitting upon a small rock fragment while his horse, at
the end of a long riata, cropped the green feed. Shoz-Dijiji
guessed that here was a military messenger riding to or from Fort
Bowie. Here, too, was a horse, and Shoz-Dijiji was perfectly
willing to ride the rest of the way to the camp of Geronimo.</p>

<p>A shot would dispose of the white-eyed soldier, but it would,
doubtless, also frighten the horse and send him galloping far out
of the reach of Apache hands; but Shoz-Dijiji was resourceful.</p>

<p>He quickly cached the rifle of the scout, for the possession of
two rifles might raise doubts that two six-shooters would not; he
adjusted the red scout band and with a bandana carefully wiped from
his face the telltale war paint of the Apache Devil. Then he arose
and walked slowly down the hillside toward the soldier, who sat
with his back toward him. So silently he moved that he was within
four or five feet of the man when he halted and spoke.</p>

<p>The soldier wheeled about as he sprang to his feet and drew his
pistol, but the sight of the smiling face of the Indian, the
extended hand and the red band of the government scout removed his
fears instantly.</p>

<p>"Nejeunee, nejeunee," Shoz-Dijiji assured him, using the Apache
word meaning friend, and stepping forward grasped the soldier's
hand.</p>

<p>Smiling pleasantly, Shoz-Dijiji looked at the horse and then at
the riata approvingly.</p>

<p>"You belong Crawford's outfit?" inquired the soldier.</p>

<p>"Me no sabe," said Shoz-Dijiji. He picked up the riata and
examined it. "Mucho bueno!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"You bet," agreed the cavalryman. "Damn fine rope."</p>

<p>The Apache examined the riata minutely, passing it through his
hands, and at the same time walking toward the horse slowly. The
riata, a braided hair "macarthy," was indeed a fine specimen, some
sixty feet in length, of which the soldier was pardonably proud, a
fact which threw him off his guard in the face of the Indian's
clever simulation of interest and approval.</p>

<p>When Shoz-Dijiji reached the end of the rope which was about the
horse's neck he patted the animal admiringly and turned to the
soldier, smiling enthusiastically. "Mucho bueno," he said, nodding
toward the horse.</p>

<p>"You bet," said the trooper. "Damn fine horse."</p>

<p>With his back toward the white man, Shoz-Dijiji drew his knife
and quickly severed the rope, holding the two ends concealed in his
left hand. "Mucho bueno," he repeated, turning again toward the
soldier, and then, suddenly and with seeming excitement, he pointed
up the hill back of the trooper. "Apache on dahl!" he shouted. "The
Apaches are coming!"</p>

<p>Quite naturally, under the circumstances, the soldier turned
away to look in the direction from which the savage enemy was
supposed to be swooping upon him, and as he did so the Apache Devil
vaulted into the saddle and was away. The great boulders strewing
the floor of the canyon afforded him an instant screen and though
the soldier was soon firing at him with his pistol he offered but a
momentary and fleeting target before he was out of range, carrying
away with him the cavalryman's carbine, which swung in its boot
beneath the off stirrup of the trooper's McClellan.</p>

<p>Shoz-Dijiji was greatly elated. He knew that he might have
knifed the unsuspecting pindah-lickoyee had he preferred to; but a
victory of wits and cunning gave him an even greater thrill of
satisfaction, for Apache to the core though he was, the Black Bear
killed not for the love of it but from a sense of duty to his
people and loyalty to the same cause that inspired such men as
Washington and Lincoln&mdash;freedom.</p>

<br>

<h2><a name="chap7" id="chap7">VII. &mdash; HARD PRESSED</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">REMOUNTED, and richer by a carbine, a six-shooter
and many rounds of ammunition, Shoz-Dijiji rode into the camp of
Geronimo late at night. When he had awakened the War Chief and
reported the approach of the hundred scouts under Crawford,
preparations were immediately started to break camp; and within an
hour the renegades were moving silently southward.</p>

<p>Down into Sonora they went, raiding and killing as they passed
through the terror stricken country, but moving swiftly and
avoiding contact with the enemy. In the mountains west of Casa
Grande Geronimo went into camp again, and from this base raiding
parties took relentless toll throughout the surrounding
country.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>In the mountains above Casa Grande Pedro Mariel, the
woodchopper, felled trees, cut them into proper lengths which he
split and loaded upon the backs of his patient burros. This he did
today as he had done for many years. With him now was Luis, his
nineteen year old son. Other woodchoppers, joining with the Mariels
for company and mutual protection, camped and worked with them. In
all there were a dozen men&mdash;hardy, courageous descendants of
that ancient race that built temples to their gods upon the soil of
the Western Hemisphere long before the first show boat stranded on
Ararat.</p>

<p>As the sound of their axes rang in the mountains, a pair of
savage eyes set in a painted face looked down upon them from the
rim of the canyon in which they labored. The eyes were the eyes of
Gian-nah-tah, the Be-don-ko-he Apache. They counted the number of
the men below, they took in every detail of the nearby camp, of the
disposal of the men engaged in felling new trees or cutting those
that had been felled. For a half hour they watched, then
Gian-nah-tah withdrew, silently as a shadow. The Mexicans,
unsuspecting, continued at their work, stopping occasionally to
roll a cigarette or pass some laughing remark. Luis Mariel, young
and light hearted, often sang snatches of songs which usually
concerned se&ntilde;oritas with large, dark eyes and red lips, for
Luis was young and light hearted.</p>

<p>An hour passed. Gian-nah-tah returned, but not alone. With him,
this time, were a dozen painted warriors, moving like
pumas&mdash;silently, stealthily. Among them was Shoz-Dijiji, the
Apache Devil. Down the canyon side they crept and into the bottom
below the woodchoppers. Spreading out into a thin line that crossed
the canyon's floor and extended up either side they advanced
slowly, silently, hiding behind trees, crawling across open spaces
upon their bellies. They were patient, for they were
Apaches&mdash;the personification of infinite patience.</p>

<p>Luis Mariel sang of a castle in Spain, which he thought of
vaguely as a place of many castles and beautiful se&ntilde;oritas
somewhere across a sea that was also "somewhere." Close beside him
worked his father, Pedro; thinking proudly of this fine son of
his.</p>

<p>Close to them cruel eyes looked through a band of white out of a
blue face. The Apache Devil, closest to them, watched the pair
intently. Suddenly a shot rang above the ringing axes. Manuel
Farias clutched his breast and crumpled to the ground. Other shots
came in quick succession, and then the air was rent by wild Apache
war-whoops as the savages charged the almost defenseless
woodchoppers.</p>

<p>Luis Mariel ran to his father's side. Grasping their axes they
stood shoulder to shoulder, for between them and whatever weapons
they had left in camp, were whooping Apaches. Some of the other men
tried to break through and reach their rifles, but they were shot
down. Three surrendered. A huge warrior confronted Pedro and
Luis.</p>

<p>"Pray," said Pedro, "for we are about to die." He was looking at
the face of the warrior. "It is the Apache Devil!"</p>

<p>"Who is that?" demanded the Indian, pointing to the lad.</p>

<p>"He is my oldest son," replied Pedro, wondering.</p>

<p>"Put down your axes and come here," ordered the Apache. "You
will not be harmed."</p>

<p>Pedro was not surprised to hear the Indian speak in broken
Spanish, as most Apaches understood much and spoke a little the
language of their ancient enemies; but he was surprised at the
meaning of the words he heard, surprised and skeptical. He
hesitated. Luis looked up at him, questioningly.</p>

<p>"If we lay down our axes we shall be wholly unarmed," said
Pedro.</p>

<p>"What difference does it make?" asked Luis. "He can kill us
whether we have axes in our hands or not&mdash;they will not stop
his bullets."</p>

<p>"You are right," said Pedro and threw down his axe. Luis did
likewise and together they approached the Apache Devil. "May the
Holy Mary protect us!" whispered the father.</p>

<p>The other Mexicans, having been killed or captured, Gian-nah-tah
and the balance of the braves came running toward Pedro and Luis;
but Shoz-Dijiji stepped in front of them and raised his hand.</p>

<p>"These are my friends," he said. "Do not harm them."</p>

<p>"They are enemies," cried one of the warriors, excited by blood
and anticipation of torture. "Kill them!"</p>

<p>"Very well," said Shoz-Dijiji quietly. "You may kill them, but
first you must kill Shoz-Dijiji. He has told you that they are his
friends."</p>

<p>"Why does Shoz-Dijiji protect the enemy?" demanded
Gian-nah-tah.</p>

<p>"Listen," said Shoz-Dijiji. "Many years ago Shoz-Dijiji was
hunting in these mountains. He was alone. He often saw this man
felling trees, but he did not harm him because the Apaches were not
upon the war trail at that time. A tree fell upon the man in such a
way that he could not free himself. He must have died if no one
came to help him. There was no one to come but Shoz-Dijiji.</p>

<p>"Shoz-Dijiji lifted the tree from him. The man's leg was broken.
Shoz-Dijiji placed him upon one of his burros and took him to Casa
Grande, where he lived.</p>

<p>"You all remember the time when we made the treaty of peace with
the people of Casa Grande and while we were celebrating it the
Mexican soldiers came and attacked us. They made us prisoners and
were going to shoot us.</p>

<p>"This man came to look at the captives and recognized
Shoz-Dijiji. He begged the war chief of the Mexicans to let me go,
and he took me to his home and gave me food and set me free. It was
Shoz-Dijiji who was able to release all the other Apache prisoners
because of what this man did. The other here is his son.</p>

<p>"Because of what his father did for Shoz-Dijiji neither of them
shall be killed. We shall let them take their burros and their wood
and go back in safety to their home. I have spoken."</p>

<p>"Shoz-Dijiji speaks true words when he says that these two shall
not be harmed," said Gian-nah-tah. "Let them go in peace."</p>

<p>"And look at them well," added Shoz-Dijiji, "that you may know
them and spare them if again you meet them." He turned to Pedro.
"Get your burros and your wood and go home quickly with your son.
Do not come again to the mountains while the Apaches are on the
war-trail, for Shoz-Dijiji may not be always near to protect you.
Go!"</p>

<p>Bewildered, stammering their thanks, Pedro and Luis hastened to
obey the welcome mandate of the savage while Shoz-Dijiji's
companions fell to with savage ardor upon the hideous business that
is the aftermath of an Apache victory.</p>

<p>Uninterested, Shoz-Dijiji stood idly by until the Mariels had
hastily packed their few belongings and departed, leaving their
wood behind them. No longer did his fellows ridicule or taunt
Shoz-Dijiji for his refusal to join them in the torture of their
captives or the mutilation of the dead. His courage had been proved
upon too many fields of battle, his hatred of the enemy was too
well known to leave any opening for charges of cowardice or
disloyalty. They thought him peculiar and let it go at that.
Perhaps some of the older braves recalled the accusation of the
dead Juh that Shoz-Dijiji was no Apache but a white-eyed man by
birth; but no one ever mentioned that now since Juh was dead, and
it was well known that he had died partly because he had made this
charge against the Black Bear.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>Back in the camp of the renegades Gian-nah-tah and the others
boasted loudly of their victory, exhibited the poor spoils that
they had taken from the camp of the woodchoppers, while the squaws
cooked the flesh of one of the burros for a feast in celebration.
Perhaps they were off their guard, but then, even Homer is charged
with carelessness.</p>

<p>Just as a bullet had surprised the camp of the woodchoppers
earlier in the day, so a bullet surprised the camp of the
renegades. A little Indian boy clutched his breast and crumpled to
the ground. Other shots came in quick succession, and then the air
was rent by wild Apache war whoops. Apache had surprised Apache.
Perhaps no other could have done it so well.</p>

<p>As Crawford's Scouts charged the camp of Geronimo, the
renegades, taken completely off their guard, scattered in all
directions. Pursued by a part of the attacking force, Geronimo's
warriors kept up a running fight until all the fighting men and a
few of the women and children had escaped; but a majority of the
latter were rounded up by the scouts and taken back to Crawford's
camp, prisoners of war. Only the dead body of a little boy remained
to mark the scene of a happy camp, of swift, fierce battle. In the
blue sky, above the silent pines, a vulture circled upon static
wings.</p>

<p><br>
That night the renegades gathered in a hidden mountain fastness,
and when the last far flung scout had come they compared notes and
took account of their losses. They found that nearly all of their
women and children had been captured. Of Geronimo's family only
Shoz-Dijiji remained to the old War Chief. Sons-ee-ah-ray was a
captive.</p>

<p>When their brief council was concluded, Geronimo arose. "Above
the water that falls over the red cliff in the mountains south of
Casa Grande there is a place that even the traitors who hunt us for
the pindah-lickoyee may find difficult to attack. If you start now
you will be almost there before the rays of chigo-na-ay light the
eastern sky and reveal you to the scouts of the enemy. If Geronimo
has not returned to you by the second darkness he will come no
more. Pray to Usen that he may guide and protect you. I have
spoken." The War Chief turned and strode away into the
darkness.</p>

<p>Shoz-Dijiji sprang to his feet and ran after him. "Where do you
go, Geronimo?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"To fetch Sons-ee-ah-ray from the camp of the enemy," replied
Geronimo.</p>

<p>Two other braves who had followed Shoz-Dijiji overheard. One of
them was Gian-nah-tah.</p>

<p>"Shoz-Dijiji goes with Geronimo to the camp of the enemy!"
announced the Black Bear.</p>

<p>Gian-nah-tah and the other warrior also announced their
intention of accompanying the War Chief, and in silence the four
started off single file down the rugged mountains with Geronimo in
the lead. There was no trail where they went; and the night was
dark, yet they skirted the edge of precipice, descended steep
escarpment, crossed mountain stream on slippery boulders as surely
as a man treads a wide road by the light of day.</p>

<p>They knew where Crawford's camp lay, for Gian-nah-tah had been
one of the scouts who had followed the victorious enemy; and they
came to it while there were yet two hours before dawn.</p>

<p>Crawford had made his camp beside that of a troop of United
States Cavalry that had been scouting futilely for Geronimo for
some time, and in addition to the Indian Scouts and the cavalrymen
in the combined camps there were a number of refugees who had
sought the protection of the troops. Among them being several
Mexican women and one American woman, the wife of a freighter.</p>

<p>Never quite positive of the loyalty of the Indian scouts,
Crawford and the troop commander had thought it advisable to post
cavalrymen as sentries; and as these rode their posts about the
camp the four Apaches crept forward through the darkness.</p>

<p>On their bellies, now, they wormed themselves forward, holding
small bushes in front of their heads. When a sentry's face was
turned toward them they lay motionless; when he passed on they
moved forward.</p>

<p>They had circled the camp that they might approach it up wind,
knowing that were their scent to be carried to the nostrils of a
sentry's horse he might reveal by his nervousness the presence of
something that would warrant investigation.</p>

<p>Now they lay within a few paces of the post toward which they
had been creeping. The sentry was coming toward them. There was no
moon, and it was very dark. There were bushes upon either side of
him, low sage and greasewood. That there were four more now upon
his left than there had been before he did not note, and anyway in
ten minutes he was to be relieved. It was this of which he was
thinking&mdash;not bushes.</p>

<p>He passed. Four shadowy patches moved slowly across his post. A
moment later he turned to retrace his monotonous beat. This time
the four bushes which should now have been upon his right were
again upon his left. His horse pricked up his ears and looked in
the direction of the camp. The horse had become accustomed to the
scent of Indians coming from the captives within the camp, but he
knew that they were closer now. However, he was not startled, as he
would have been had the scent come from a new direction. The man
looked casually where the horse looked&mdash;that is second nature
to a horse-man&mdash;then he rode on; and the four bushes merged
with the shadows among the tents.</p>

<p>The American woman, the wife of the freighter, had been given a
tent to herself. She was sleeping soundly, secure in the knowledge
of absolute safety, for the first time in many weeks. As she had
dozed off to sleep the night before she had hoped that her husband
was as comfortable as she; but, knowing him as she had, her mind
had been assailed by doubts. He had been killed by Apaches a week
previously.</p>

<p>She was awakened by a gentle shaking. When she opened her eyes
she saw nothing as it was dark in the tent; but she felt a hand
upon her arm, and when she started to speak a palm was slapped
across her mouth.</p>

<p>"Make noise, gettum killed," whispered a deep voice. "Shut up,
no gettum killed."</p>

<p>The hand was removed. "What do you want?" whispered the woman.
"I'll keep shet up."</p>

<p>"Where is the wife of Geronimo?" pursued the questioner.</p>

<p>"I dunno," replied the woman, sullenly. "Who are you&mdash;one
o' them Injun Scouts? Why don't you go ask some other Injun? I
dunno."</p>

<p>"May-be-so you find out pronto. Me Apache Devil. She my mother.
You tellum damn pronto or Apache Devil cut your damn fool throat.
Sabe?"</p>

<p>The woman felt the edge of a knife against the flesh at her
throat.</p>

<p>"She's in the next tent," she whispered hastily.</p>

<p>"You lie, me come back and kill," he said, then he bound her
hands and feet and tied a gag in her mouth, using strips torn from
her own clothing for these purposes.</p>

<p>In the next tent they found Sons-ee-ah-ray, and a few minutes
later five bushes crossed the post that four had previously
crossed.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>In the new camp south of Casa Grande the renegades found peace
but for a few days, and then came Mexican troops one morning and
attacked them. The skirmishing lasted all day. A few Mexican
soldiers were killed; and at night the Apaches, having sustained no
loss, moved eastward into the foothills of the Sierra Madres.</p>

<p>A few more days of rest and once again the Mexican troops,
following them, attacked; but the Apaches had not been caught
unawares. Their women and children were sent deeper into the
mountains, while the warriors remained to hold the soldiers in
check.</p>

<p>During a lull in the fighting Geronimo gathered several of his
followers about him. "The Mexicans now have a large army against
us," he said. "If we stand and fight them many of us will be
killed. We cannot hope to win. It is senseless to fight under such
circumstances. Let us wait until our chance of victory is
greater."</p>

<p>The others agreed with the War Chief, and the renegades
withdrew. Shoz-Dijiji and Gian-nah-tah were sent to ascertain the
strength of the troops against them and their location, while the
main body of the renegades followed the squaws to the new camp.</p>

<p>It was very late when Shoz-Dijiji and Gian-nah-tah rejoined
their fellows. They came silently into camp after having been
challenged and passed by savage sentries. They wore grave faces as
they approached Geronimo. The War Chief had been sleeping; but he
arose when he learned that his scouts had returned, and when he had
had their report he summoned all the warriors to a council.</p>

<p>"Shoz-Dijiji and Gian-nah-tah, with the speed of the deer, the
cunning of the fox, and the vision of the eagle, have gone among
the enemy and seen much. Let Shoz-Dijiji tell you what he told
Geronimo."</p>

<p>"For many days," said Shoz-Dijiji, "we have been pressed closely
by the enemy. First by the Scouts of the pindah-lickoyee, then by
the warriors of the Mexicans. Wherever we go, they follow. We have
had no time to hunt or raid. We are almost without food. Usen has
put many things in the mountains and upon the plains for Apaches to
eat. We can go on thus for a long time, but I do not think we can
win.</p>

<p>"These things you should know. We are but a few warriors, and
against us are the armies of two powerful nations. Shoz-Dijiji
thinks that it would be wise to wait a little until they forget. In
the past they have forgotten. They will forget again. Then the
Apaches may take up the war trail once more or remain in peaceful
ways, hunting and trading.</p>

<p>"Today Gian-nah-tah and Shoz-Dijiji saw soldiers in many places
all through the mountains. There were soldiers of the Mexicans,
there were soldiers of the pindah-lickoyee, there were the Apache
Scouts of Crawford. They are all waiting to kill us. Perhaps we can
escape them, perhaps we cannot. It would be foolish to attack them.
We are too few, and our brothers have turned against us."</p>

<p>"How many soldiers did you see?" asked Na-chi-ta.</p>

<p>"Perhaps two thousand, perhaps more," replied Shoz-Dijiji.
"There are infantry and cavalry, and cannon mounted on the backs of
mules."</p>

<p>"Chihuahua thought Shoz-Dijiji wished only to fight against the
pindah-lickoyee," said Chihuahua. "He made big talk before we went
on the war trail after we left San Carlos. Has Shoz-Dijiji's heart
turned to water?"</p>

<p>"I do not know," said Shoz-Dijiji. "I think it has not turned to
water, but it is very sad. Shoz-Dijiji learned at his mother's
breast to love nothing better than fighting the enemies of the
Shis-Inday, but he did not learn to love to fight his own people. I
think it made his heart sick that day that he saw White Mountain
firing upon White Mountain, Cho-kon-en upon Cho-kon-en. That is not
war, that is murder.</p>

<p>"Every man's hand is against us, but that Shoz-Dijiji did not
mind. What he does mind is to know that our own hands are against
us, too."</p>

<p>"Shoz-Dijiji has spoken true words," said Kut-le. "It sickens
the heart in the breast of a warrior to see brother and cousin
fighting against him at the side of his enemies.</p>

<p>"We know that we are surrounded by many soldiers. We cannot
fight them. Perhaps we can escape them, but they will follow us. It
will be hard to find food and water, for these things they will
first try to deprive us of.</p>

<p>"I think that we should make peace with our enemies. I have
spoken."</p>

<p>Thus spoke Kut-le, the bravest of the renegades. Savage heads
nodded approval.</p>

<p>"Let us go to the camp of the white-eyed soldiers in the
morning," suggested one, "and lay down our weapons."</p>

<p>"And be shot down like coyotes," growled Geronimo. "No! Geronimo
does not surrender. He makes peace. He does not stick his head in a
trap, either. We will send a messenger to Crawford to arrange a
parley with Nan-tan-des-la-par-en. The heart of Crawford is good.
He does not lie to the Shis-Inday. By the first light of
Chigo-na-ay Shoz-Dijiji shall go to the kunh-gan-hay of the scouts
and carry the message of Geronimo to Crawford. If he promises to
protect us from the soldiers of the pindah-lickoyee and the
Mexicans, we will accompany him north and hold a peace parlay with
Nan-tan-des-la-par-en." He turned toward Shoz-Dijiji. "You have
heard the words of Geronimo. When dawn comes go to Crawford. You
will know what to say to him."</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="chap8" id="chap8">VIII. &mdash; GERONIMO AND CROOK</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">CRAWFORD'S scouts were preparing to ride with the
coming of the new day when there appeared upon a little eminence
near their camp the figure of an Indian. Silent and erect it
stood&mdash;a bronze statue touched by the light of the rising sun.
Slowly, to and fro, it waved a white rag that was attached to the
muzzle of a rifle. A scout called Crawford's attention to the flag
of truce; and the cavalry officer, bearing a similar emblem, went
out alone and on foot toward the messenger, who now came slowly
forward until the two met a couple of hundred yards from the
camp.</p>

<p>Crawford recognized the Black Bear and nodded, waiting for him
to speak.</p>

<p>"Shoz-Dijiji brings a message from Geronimo," said the
Apache.</p>

<p>"What message does Geronimo send me?" asked the officer. Both
men spoke in the language of the Shis-Inday.</p>

<p>"Geronimo has heard that Nan-tan-des-la-par-en wishes to hold a
parley with him," replied Shoz-Dijiji.</p>

<p>"Nan-tan-des-la-par-en wishes only that Geronimo surrenders with
all his warriors, women, and children," said Crawford. "There is no
need for a parley. Tell Geronimo that if he will come to my camp
with all his people, bringing also all his horses and mules, and
lay down his arms, I will take him to Nan-tan-des-la-par-en in
safety."</p>

<p>"That is surrender," replied Shoz-Dijiji. "Geronimo will not
surrender. He will make peace with Nan-tan-des-la-par-en, but he
will not surrender."</p>

<p>"Black Bear," said Crawford, "you are a great warrior among your
people, you are an intelligent man, you know that we have you
surrounded by a greatly superior force, you are worn by much
fighting and marching, you are short of food, you cannot escape us
this time. I know these things; you know them; Geronimo knows
them.</p>

<p>"It will be better for you and your people if you come in
peaceably now and return with me. Nan-tan-des-la-par-en will not be
hard on you if you surrender now, but if you cause us any more
trouble it may go very hard indeed with you. Think it over."</p>

<p>"We have thought it over," replied the Black Bear. "We know that
a handful of braves cannot be victorious over the armies of two
great nations, but we also know that we can keep on fighting for a
long time before we are all killed and that in the meantime we
shall kill many more of our enemies than we lose. You know that
these are true words. Therefore it would be better for you to
arrange for a parley with Nan-tan-des-la-par-en than to force us
back upon the war trail.</p>

<p>"Geronimo is a proud man. The thing that you demand he will
never consent to, but a peace parley with Nan-tan-des-la-par-en
might bring the same results without so greatly injuring the pride
of Geronimo.</p>

<p>"These things I may say to you because it is well known that
your heart is not bad against the Apaches. Of all the
pindah-lickoyee you are best fitted to understand. That is why
Geronimo sent me to you. He would not have sent this message to any
white-eyed man but you or Lieutenant Gatewood. Him we trust also.
We do not trust Nan-tan-des-la-par-en any more; but if we have your
promise that no harm shall befall us we will go with you and talk
with him, but we must be allowed to keep our weapons and our
live-stock. I have spoken."</p>

<p>"I get your point," said Crawford after a moment of thought. "If
Geronimo and the warriors in his party will give me their word that
they will accompany us peaceably I will take them to General Crook
and guarantee them safe escort, but I cannot promise what General
Crook will do. Geronimo knows that I have no authority to do
that."</p>

<p>"We shall come in and make camp near you this afternoon," said
Shoz-Dijiji. "Tell your scouts not to fire upon us."</p>

<p>"When you come stop here, and I will tell you where to camp,"
replied Crawford. "Geronimo and two others may come into my camp to
talk with me, but if at any time more of you enter my camp armed I
shall consider it a hostile demonstration. Do you understand?"</p>

<p>Shoz-Dijiji nodded and without more words turned and retraced
his steps toward the camp of the renegades, while Crawford stood
watching him until he had disappeared beyond a rise of ground. Not
once did the Apache glance back. The cavalry officer shook his
head. "It is difficult," he mused, "not to trust a man who has,
such implicit confidence in one's honor."</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>That afternoon, January 11, 1886, promised to witness the
termination of more than three hundred years of virtually constant
warfare between the Apaches and the whites. Captain Crawford and
Lieutenant Maus were jubilant&mdash;they were about to succeed
where so many others had failed. The days of heat and thirst and
gruelling work were over.</p>

<p>"Geronimo is through," said Crawford. "He is ready to give up
and come in and be a good Indian. If he wasn't he'd never have sent
the Black Bear with that message."</p>

<p>"I don't trust any of them," replied Maus, "and as for being a
good Indian&mdash;there's only one thing that'll ever make Geronimo
that"&mdash;he touched the butt of his pistol.</p>

<p>"That doctrine is responsible to a greater extent than any other
one thing for many of the atrocities and the seeming treachery of
the Apaches," replied Crawford. "They have heard that so often that
they do not really trust any of us, for they believe that we all
hold the same view. It makes them nervous when any of us are near
them, and as they are always suspicious of us the least suggestion
of an overt act on our part frightens them onto the war trail and
goads them to reprisals.</p>

<p>"It has taken months of the hardest kind of work to reach the
point where Geronimo is ready to make peace&mdash;a thoughtless
word or gesture now may easily undo all that we have accomplished.
Constantly impress upon the scouts by word and example the fact
that every precaution must be taken to convince the renegades that
we intend to fulfill every promise that I have made them."</p>

<p><br>
Shoz-Dijiji came and stood before Geronimo. "What did the
white-eyed chief say to you?" demanded the old war chief.</p>

<p>"He said that if we lay down our arms and surrender he will take
us to Nan-tan-des-la-par-en," replied Shoz-Dijiji.</p>

<p>"What did Shoz-Dijiji reply?"</p>

<p>"Shoz-Dijiji told the white-eyed man that Geronimo would not
surrender, but that he would hold a parley with
Nan-tan-des-la-par-en. At last the white-eyed chief agreed. We may
retain our arms, and he promises that we shall not be attacked if
we accompany him peaceably to the parley with
Nan-tan-des-la-par-en."</p>

<p>"What did you reply?"</p>

<p>"That we would come and make camp near him this afternoon. He
has promised that his scouts will not fire upon us."</p>

<p>"Good!" exclaimed Geronimo. "Let us make ready to move our camp,
and let it be understood that if the word made between Shoz-Dijiji
and the white-eyed chief be broken and shots fired in anger the
first shot shall not be fired by a member of my band. I have
spoken!"</p>

<p>As the renegades broke camp and moved slowly in the direction of
Crawford's outfit a swart Mexican cavalryman, concealed behind the
summit of a low hill, watched them, and as he watched a grim smile
of satisfaction played for an instant about the corners of his
eyes. Ten minutes later he was reporting to Captain Santa Anna
Perez.</p>

<p>"They shall not escape me this time," said Perez, as he gave the
command to resume the march in pursuit of the illusive enemy.</p>

<p><br>
A short distance from Crawford's camp Geronimo halted his band and
sent Shoz-Dijiji ahead to arrange a meeting between Geronimo and
Crawford for the purpose of ratifying the understanding that
Shoz-Dijiji and the officer had arrived at earlier in the day.</p>

<p>With a white rag fastened to the muzzle of his rifle the Black
Bear approached the camp of the Scouts and, following the
instructions of Crawford to his men, was permitted to enter. Every
man of Crawford's command Shoz-Dijiji knew personally. With many of
them he had played as a boy; and with most of them he had gone upon
the war trail, fighting shoulder to shoulder with them against both
Mexicans and pindah-lickoyee; but today he passed among them with
his head high, as one might pass among strangers and enemies.</p>

<p>Crawford, waiting to receive him, could not but admire the
silent contempt of the tall young war chief for those of his own
race whom he must consider nothing short of traitors; and in his
heart the courageous cavalry officer found respect and
understanding for this other courageous soldier of an alien
race.</p>

<p>"I am glad that you have come, Shoz-Dijiji," he said. "You bring
word from Geronimo? He will go with me to General Crook?"</p>

<p>"Geronimo wishes to come and make talk with you," replied the
Black Bear. "He wishes his own ears to hear the words you spoke to
Shoz-Dijiji this morning."</p>

<p>"Good!" said Crawford. "Let Geronimo&mdash;" His words were cut
short by a fusillade of shots from the direction of the renegades'
position.</p>

<p>Crawford snatched his pistol from its holster and covered
Shoz-Dijiji.</p>

<p>"So that is the word Geronimo sends?" he exclaimed.
"Treachery!"</p>

<p>The Apache wheeled about and looked in the direction of his
people. The scouts were hastily preparing to meet an attack. Every
eye was on the renegades&mdash;in every mind was the same thought
that Crawford had voiced&mdash;treachery!</p>

<p>Shoz-Dijiji pointed. "No!" he cried. "Look! It is not the
warriors of Geronimo. Their backs are toward us. They are firing in
the other direction. They are being attacked from the south. There!
See! Mexican soldiers!"</p>

<p>The renegades, firing as they came, were falling back upon the
scouts' camp; and, following them, there now came into full view a
company of Mexican regulars.</p>

<p>"For God's sake, stop firing!" cried Crawford. "These are United
States troops."</p>

<p>Captain Santa Anna Perez saw before him only Apaches. It is true
that some of them wore portions of the uniform of the soldiers of a
sister republic; but Captain Santa Anna Perez had fought Apaches
for years, and he well knew that they were shrewd enough to take
advantage of any form of deception of which they could avail
themselves, and he thought this but a ruse.</p>

<p>Two of his officers lay dead and two privates, while several
others were wounded, and now the Apaches in uniform, as well as
those who were not, were firing upon him. How was he to know the
truth? What was he to do? One of his subordinates ran to his side.
"There has been a terrible mistake!" he cried. "Those are
Crawford's scouts&mdash;I recognize the captain. In the name of
God, give the command to cease firing!"</p>

<p>Perez acted immediately upon the advice of his lieutenant, but
the tragic blunder had not as yet taken its full toll of life. In
the front line a young Mexican soldier knelt with his carbine.
Perhaps he was excited. Perhaps he did not hear the loudly shouted
command of his captain. No one will ever know why he did the thing
he did.</p>

<p>The others on both sides had ceased firing when this youth
raised his carbine to his shoulder, took careful aim, and fired.
Uttering no sound, dead on his feet, Captain Emmet Crawford fell
with a bullet in his brain.</p>

<p>Shoz-Dijiji, who had been standing beside him, had witnessed the
whole occurrence. He threw his own rifle to his shoulder and
pressed the trigger. When he lowered the smoking muzzle Crawford
had been avenged, and that is why no one will ever know why the
Mexican soldier did the thing he did.</p>

<p>With difficulty Perez and Maus quieted their men, and it was
with equal difficulty that Geronimo held his renegades in check.
They were gathered in a little knot to one side, and Shoz-Dijiji
had joined them.</p>

<p>"It was a ruse to trap us!" cried a brave. "They intended to get
us between them and kill us all."</p>

<p>"Do not talk like a child!" exclaimed Shoz-Dijiji. "Not one of
us has been killed or wounded, while they have lost several on each
side. The Mexicans made a mistake. They did not know Crawford's
scouts were near, nor did Crawford know that the Mexican soldiers
were approaching."</p>

<p>The brave grunted. "Look," he said, pointing; "the war chiefs of
the Mexicans and the pindah-lickoyee are holding a council. If they
are not plotting against us why do they not invite our chiefs to
the council? It is not I who am a child but Shoz-Dijiji, if he
trusts the pindah-lickoyee or the Mexicans."</p>

<p>"Perhaps they make bad talk about us," said Geronimo,
suspiciously. "Maus does not like me; and, with Crawford dead,
there is no friend among them that I may trust. The Mexicans I have
never trusted."</p>

<p>"Nor does Shoz-Dijiji trust them," said the Black Bear. "The
battle they just fought was a mistake. That, I say again; but it
does not mean that I trust them. Perhaps they are plotting against
us now; for Crawford is dead."</p>

<p>"Maus and the Mexican could combine forces against us,"
suggested Geronimo, nervously. "Both the Mexicans and
pindah-lickoyee have tricked us before. They would not hesitate to
do it again. We are few, they are many&mdash;they could wipe us
out, and there would be none left to say that it happened through
treachery."</p>

<p>"Let us attack them first," suggested a warrior. "They are off
their guard. We could kill many of them and the rest would run
away. Come!"</p>

<p>"No!" cried Geronimo. "Our women are with us. We are very few.
All would be killed. Let us withdraw and wait. Perhaps we shall
have a better chance later. Only fools attack when they know they
cannot win. Perhaps Nan-tan-des-la-par-en will come and we shall
make peace. That will be better. I am tired of fighting."</p>

<p>"Let us go away for a while, at least until the Mexicans have
left," counseled Shoz-Dijiji. "Then, perhaps, we can make terms
with Maus. If not we can pick our own time and place to fight."</p>

<p>"That is good talk," said Geronimo. "Come! We shall move away
slowly."</p>

<p>Maus and Perez, engaged in arranging terms for the removal of
Crawford's body and exchanging notes that would relieve one another
of responsibility for the tragic incident of the battle between the
troops of friendly nations, paid little attention to the renegades,
and once again Geronimo slipped through the fingers of his would-be
captors, and as Maus' and Perez' commands marched away together
toward Nacori the scouts of the old war chief watched them depart
and carried the word to Geronimo.</p>

<p>"They have marched away together&mdash;the Mexicans and the
pindah-lickoyee?" demanded Geronimo. "That is bad. They are
planning to join forces against us. They will return, but they will
not find us here."</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>Again the renegades changed camp; this time to a still more
remote and inaccessible position. The days ran into weeks, the
weeks to months. The band scattered, scouting and hunting. At all
times Geronimo knew the location of Maus' command; and when he
became reasonably convinced that Maus was waiting for the arrival
of Crook and was not planning a hostile move against the renegades
he made no further attempt to conceal his location from the white
officer, but he did not relax his vigilance.</p>

<p><br>
It was late in March. Geronimo, Shoz-Dijiji, Gian-nah-tah, and
several others were squatting in the shade of a sycamore, smoking
and chatting, when two Apaches entered the camp and approached
them. One was one of Geronimo's own scouts, the other wore the red
head-band of a government scout. When the two halted before
Geronimo the war chief arose.</p>

<p>"What do you want in the camp of Geronimo?" he asked, addressing
the government scout as though he had been a total stranger.</p>

<p>"I bring a message from Maus," replied the other.
"Nan-tan-des-la-par-en has come. He is ready to hold a parley with
you. What answer shall I take back?"</p>

<p>"Tell Nan-tan-des-la-par-en that Geronimo will meet him tomorrow
in the Canyon of Los Embudos."</p>

<p><br>
When the morning came Geronimo set out with a party of chiefs and
warriors for the meeting place. Mangas was with him and Na-chi-ta,
and there were Shoz-Dijiji, Gian-nah-tah, Chihuahua, Nanay, and
Kut-le in the party. General Crook was awaiting them in the Canyon
of Los Embudos. The two parties exchanged salutations and then
seated themselves in a rough circle under the shade of large
sycamore and cottonwood trees.</p>

<p>General Crook addressed Geronimo almost immediately. "Why did
you leave the reservation?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"You told me that I might live in the reservation the same as
white people live," replied Geronimo, "but that was not true. You
sent soldiers to take my horses and cattle from me. I had a crop of
oats almost ready to harvest, but I could not live in the
reservation after the way you had treated me. I went away with my
wife and children to live in peace as my own people have always
lived. I did not go upon the war trail, but you told your soldiers
to find me and put me in prison and if I resisted to kill me."</p>

<p>"I never gave any such orders," snapped Crook.</p>

<p>Geronimo did not reply.</p>

<p>"But," continued Crook, "if you left the reservation for that
reason, why did you kill innocent people, sneaking all over the
country to do it? What did those innocent people do to you that you
should kill them, steal their horses, and slip around in the rocks
like coyotes?</p>

<p>"You promised me in the Sierra Madre that that peace should
last, but you have lied about it. When a man has lied to me once I
want some better proof than his own word before I can believe him
again."</p>

<p>"So does Geronimo," interrupted the war chief.</p>

<p>"You must make up your mind," continued Crook, "whether you will
stay out on the war path or surrender unconditionally. If you stay
out I'll keep after you and kill the last one if it takes fifty
years."</p>

<p>"I do not want to fight the white man," replied Geronimo; "but I
do not want to return to the reservation and be hanged, as many of
the white people have said that I should be. People tell bad
stories about me. I do not want that any more. When a man tries to
do right, people should not tell bad stories about him. I have
tried to do right. Does the white man try to do right? I am the
same man. I have the same feet, legs, and hands; and the sun looks
down upon me, a complete man.</p>

<p>"The Sun and the Darkness and the Winds are all listening to
what we say now. They know that Geronimo is telling the truth. To
prove to you that I am telling the truth, remember that I sent you
word that I would come from a place far away to speak to you here;
and you see me now. If I were thinking bad, or if I had done bad, I
would never have come here."</p>

<p>He paused, waiting for Crook to reply.</p>

<p>"I have said all that I have to say," said the General; "you had
better think it over tonight and let me know in the morning."</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>For two more days the parley progressed; and at last it was
agreed that Geronimo and his band should accompany Lieutenant Maus
and his battalion of scouts to Fort Bowie, Arizona. The northward
march commenced on the morning of March 28th and by the night of
the 29th the party had reached the border between Mexico and
Arizona.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="chap9" id="chap9">IX. &mdash; RED FOOLS AND WHITE
SCOUNDRELS</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">IN the camp of the Apaches, which lay at a little
distance from that of the troops, there was an atmosphere of
nervousness and suspicion.</p>

<p>"I do not like the way in which Nan-tan-des-la-par-en spoke to
me," said Geronimo. "I know that he did not speak the truth when he
said that he had not ordered the soldiers to catch me and to kill
me if I resisted. Perhaps he is not telling me the truth now."</p>

<p>"They have lied to us always before," said Na-chi-ta. "Now, if
we go back with them to Fort Bowie, how do we know that they will
not put us in prison. We are chiefs. If they wish to frighten our
people they may kill us. The white-eyed men are crying for the
blood of Geronimo."</p>

<p>"If they kill Geronimo they will kill Na-chi-ta also," said
Shoz-Dijiji.</p>

<p>"I have thought of that," replied Na-chi-ta. "They will not kill
us," said Chihuahua. "They will be content to know that we are no
longer on the war trail. We have taught them a lesson this time.
Now, maybe, they will let us alone."</p>

<p>"Chihuahua thinks only of the little farm the white-eyes let him
work&mdash;like a woman," scoffed Shoz-Dijiji. "I hate them. I
shall not go back to live upon a reservation. I shall not go back
to be laughed at by white-eyed men, to hear them call me a damn
Siwash, to listen while they make fun of my gods and insult my
mother and my sisters."</p>

<p>"Shoz-Dijiji will go upon the war-trail alone and do battle with
all the soldiers of two great nations?" sneered Chihuahua.</p>

<p>"Then Shoz-Dijiji will at least die like a man and a warrior,"
replied the Black Bear.</p>

<p>"Have we not troubles enough without quarreling among
ourselves?" demanded Geronimo.</p>

<p>"And now Gian-nah-tah is bringing more trouble into our camp,"
said Chihuahua. "Look!" and he pointed toward the young warrior,
who was walking toward them.</p>

<p>In each hand Gian-nah-tah carried a bottle of whiskey, and his
slightly unsteady gait was fair evidence that he had been drinking.
He approached the group of men, women, and children and extended
one of the bottles toward Geronimo. The old chief took a long drink
and passed the bottle to Na-chi-ta.</p>

<p>Shoz-Dijiji stood eyeing them silently. By no changed expression
did he show either disapproval or its opposite, but when Na-chi-ta
passed the whiskey on to him, after having drunk deeply, he shook
his head and grinned.</p>

<p>"Why do you smile?" demanded Na-chi-ta.</p>

<p>"Because now I shall not turn back into Mexico alone," replied
the Black Bear.</p>

<p>"Why do you say that?" asked Geronimo.</p>

<p>The bottle went the rounds, though all did not drink. Chihuahua
was one who did not.</p>

<p>"Where did you get this, Gian-nah-tah?" asked Geronimo.</p>

<p>"A white-eyed man is selling it just across the border in
Mexico. He is selling it to the soldiers too. He says that they are
boasting about what they are going to do to Geronimo and his band.
They make much bad talk against you."</p>

<p>"What do they say they are going to do to us?" demanded
Geronimo, taking another drink.</p>

<p>"They are going to shoot us all as soon as we are across the
border."</p>

<p>Chihuahua laughed. "The foolish talk of drunken men," he
said.</p>

<p>"Many of the white-eyed soldiers are drunk," continued
Gian-nah-tah. "When they are drunk they may kill us. Let us turn
back. If we must be killed let us be killed in battle and not shot
down from behind by drunken white-eyes."</p>

<p>"Now would be a good time to attack them," said Na-chi-ta,
"while they are drunk."</p>

<p>"If we do not kill them they will kill us," urged Gian-nah-tah.
"Come!"</p>

<p>"Shut up, Gian-nah-tah!" commanded Shoz-Dijiji. "The strong
water of the white-eyed men does not make you a war chief to lead
the braves of the Shis-Inday into battle&mdash;it only makes you a
fool."</p>

<p>"Shoz-Dijiji calls Gian-nah-tah a fool?" demanded the young
warrior angrily. "Shoz-Dijiji does not want to fight the
pindah-lickoyee because Shoz-Dijiji is a coward and himself a
pindah-lickoyee."</p>

<p>Shoz-Dijiji's eyes narrowed as he took a step toward
Gian-nah-tah. The latter drew his great butcher knife, but he
retreated. Then it was that Geronimo stepped between them. "If you
want to kill," he said, "there is always the enemy."</p>

<p>"I do not want to kill Gian-nah-tah, my best friend," said
Shoz-Dijiji. "Perhaps it was the strong water of the
pindah-lickoyee that spoke through the mouth of Gian-nah-tah.
Tomorrow, when he is sober, Shoz-Dijiji will ask him; but no man
may call Shoz-Dijiji a white-eyes and live. Juh learned that when
Shoz-Dijiji killed him."</p>

<p>"Shut up, Gian-nah-tah," advised Na-chi-ta, "and go to the
white-eyed fool who sold you this strong water and buy more. Here!"
He handed Gian-nah-tah several pieces of silver money. "Get
plenty."</p>

<p>Many of the braves already felt the effects of the adulterated,
raw spirits that Tribollet was selling them at ten dollars a
gallon, and most of those that had been drinking were daubing their
faces with war paint and boasting of what they would do to the
soldiers of the pindah-lickoyee.</p>

<p>They greeted Gian-nah-tah with shouts of savage welcome when he
returned with more whiskey, and as they drank they talked loudly of
killing all the white soldiers first and then taking the war trail
in a final campaign that would wipe out the last vestige of the
white race from the land of the Shis-Inday.</p>

<p>Shoz-Dijiji looked on in sorrow&mdash;not because they were
drunk or because they talked of killing the white-eyed people; but
because he knew that if they were not stopped they would soon be so
drunk that they could not even defend themselves in the event that
the soldiers of the pindah-lickoyee set upon them, as persistent
rumors from Tribollet's ranch suggested might occur before
dawn.</p>

<p>He went to Geronimo and urged him to make some effort to stop
the drinking; but Geronimo, himself inflamed by drink, would do
nothing. As a matter of fact there was really nothing that he could
do since the Apache is a confirmed individualist who resents
receiving orders from anyone.</p>

<p>Shoz-Dijiji considered the advisability of taking a few of the
warriors who had not drunk to excess and leading them in a raid
upon Tribollet's ranch, but he had to abandon the idea because he
knew that it would lead to killing and that that would bring the
soldiers down upon their camp.</p>

<p>In the end he hit upon another plan; and shortly after, he was
in the camp of the Apache scouts where he aroused Alchise and
Ka-e-ten-na.</p>

<p>"Listen," said Shoz-Dijiji, "to the sounds you can hear coming
from the camp of Geronimo."</p>

<p>"We hear them," said Alchise. "Are you fools that you do not
sleep when tomorrow you must march all day in the hot sun?"</p>

<p>"They are all drunk upon the tizwin of the white-eyes," said
Shoz-Dijiji. "If more of it is brought into the camp of Geronimo
there will be trouble. Already many of the braves have put on the
war paint. Shoz-Dijiji has come to you to ask that you go to
Nan-tan-des-la-par-en and tell him that he must send soldiers to
prevent the white-eyed fool from selling more fire water to the
Apaches and to stop the stories that are being told to our people.
Otherwise there will be trouble."</p>

<p>"When did Shoz-Dijiji begin to fear trouble with the white-eyed
men?" demanded Ka-e-ten-na.</p>

<p>"When he saw the warriors of his people getting so drunk that
soon they will be unable to defend themselves, though not so drunk
but that some one of them, who may be a bigger fool than the
others, will certainly fire upon the first pindah-lickoyee he sees
when dawn comes. That is when Shoz-Dijiji began to fear&mdash;not
war but certain defeat."</p>

<p>"Did Na-chi-ta send you with this message?" asked Alchise.</p>

<p>"Na-chi-ta is so drunk that he cannot stand upon his feet,"
replied Shoz-Dijiji.</p>

<p>"We will go to Nan-tan-des-la-par-en," said Ka-e-ten-na, "and
ask him to let us take some scouts and stop the sale of this stuff
to all Apaches."</p>

<p>"Shoz-Dijiji will wait here until you return," said the Black
Bear.</p>

<p>As Shoz-Dijiji waited, the sounds that came to his ears
indicated restlessness and activity in the camp of the white
soldiers that lay at no great distance from that of the scouts, and
these sounds aroused his suspicions, for at this hour of the night
the camp should have been quiet. He read in them preparation for
attack&mdash;treachery. He could not know that they were caused by
a few drunken soldiers and portended nothing more serious than a
few days in the guard house for the culprits when they reached the
Post.</p>

<p>The false rumors that Tribollet and his men had spread among the
renegades were working in the mind of Shoz-Dijiji, and he was
already upon the point of returning to his own camp when
Ka-e-ten-na and Alchise came back from their interview with
Crook.</p>

<p>"Has Nan-tan-des-la-par-en told you to take warriors and stop
the sale of fire water to the Apaches?" demanded Shoz-Dijiji.</p>

<p>"No," replied Alchise.</p>

<p>"He is going to send white-eyed soldiers instead?" asked the
Black Bear.</p>

<p>"He will send no one," said Ka-e-ten-na.</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"We do not know."</p>

<p>Shoz-Dijiji was worried when he came again to the camp of the
renegades. Na-chi-ta was lying helpless upon the ground. Geronimo
was drunk, though he still could walk. Most of the braves were
asleep. Shoz-Dijiji went at once to Geronimo.</p>

<p>"I have just come from the camp of the scouts," he said. "I
could hear the white-eyed soldiers preparing for battle. Perhaps
they will attack us before dawn. Look at your warriors, Geronimo.
They are all drunk. They cannot fight. All will be killed. You
would not listen to Shoz-Dijiji then, but now you must. I am war
chief of the Be-don-ko-he. You are war chief of all the Apaches,
but you are too drunk to lead them in battle or to counsel them
with wisdom. Therefore you shall listen to Shoz-Dijiji and do what
he says. Only thus may we save our people from being wiped out by
the soldiers of the pindah-lickoyee before chigo-na-ay has risen
above the tree tops."</p>

<p>The words of Shoz-Dijiji had a slightly sobering effect upon
Geronimo. He looked about him. By the flickering light of dying
fires he saw the flower of his fighting force lying in drunken
stupor, prone upon the ground, like beasts.</p>

<p>Shoz-Dijiji stood with a sneer upon his lip. "The
pindah-lickoyee want the Shis-Inday to come out of the mountains
and live as they live," he said. "They want the poor Apache to be
like them. Here is the result. We have come out of the mountains,
and already we are like the pindah-lickoyee. If we live among them
long our women will be like their women; and then you will not see
an Apache woman whose nose has not been cut off or an Apache man
who is not always lying in the dirt, drunk.</p>

<p>"But that will not be for those of us who are here, Geronimo, if
we stay here until after Tapida brings the new day, for we shall
all be dead. The soldiers of the white-eyes are already preparing
to attack us. How may drunken men defend their families and
themselves? We shall all be killed if we do not go at once. I have
spoken."</p>

<p>Slowly Geronimo gathered his muddled wits. The words of
Shoz-Dijiji took form within his brain. He saw the condition of his
warriors, and he recalled not only the rumors that had come from
Tribollet's but also the treacherous attacks that had been made
upon his people by the white-eyed soldiers in the past.</p>

<p>"There is yet time," said Shoz-Dijiji. "The night is dark. If we
leave at once and in silence we can be far away before they know
that we have left. Another day, when our warriors are sober, we can
fight them but not today."</p>

<p>"Awake them all," said Geronimo. "Gather the women and children.
Tell them that we are going back into the mountains of Mexico. Tell
them that we are not going to remain here to be murdered by our
enemies or taken back to Bowie to be hanged."</p>

<p>They did not all answer the summons of Geronimo. Na-chi-ta went
but he did not know that he was going or where. They threw him
across the back of a mule; and Shoz-Dijiji loaded Gian-nah-tah upon
another, and Geronimo rode silently out through the night with
these and eighteen other warriors, fourteen women, and two boys,
down into the mountains of Mexico; and the results of months of the
hardest campaign that, possibly, any troops in the history of
warfare ever experienced were entirely nullified by one cheap white
man with a barrel of cheap whiskey.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="chap10" id="chap10">X. &mdash; TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS
FOR A HEAD</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">DOWN into the rugged mountain fastness of Sonora
the remnants of Geronimo's band of renegades hurried from the
menace of the white man's justice. Suffering from the after effects
of Tribollet's whiskey they marched in sullen silence, thinking
only of escape, for the fighting spirit of a sick man is not won't
to rise to any great heights.</p>

<p>For sixteen hours they marched with but a single brief rest, and
it was again dark when they went into camp.</p>

<p>Water and a little food revived their spirits. There was even
laughter, low pitched lest it reach across the night to the ears of
an enemy.</p>

<p>Shoz-Dijiji squatted upon his haunches chewing upon a strip of
jerked venison that was both dirty and "high" and that not only
pleased his palate but gave him strength, renewing the iron tissue
of his iron frame. Less fastidious, perhaps, than a civilized
epicure in the preparation and serving of his food, yet, savage
though he was, he appreciated the same delicate flavor of partial
decay.</p>

<p>As he ate, a tall warrior came and stood before him. It was
Gian-nah-tah. Shoz-Dijiji continued eating, in silence.</p>

<p>"At the kunh-gan-hay beside the soldiers of
Nan-tan-des-la-par-en," commenced Gian-nah-tah, presently, "the
poisoned water of the pindah-lickoyee spoke through the mouth of
Gian-nah-tah, saying words that Gian-nah-tah would not have said."
He stopped, waiting.</p>

<p>"Shoz-Dijiji knew that Gian-nah-tah, his best friend, did not
speak those words," replied Shoz-Dijiji. "It was the bad spirits
that the white man puts into his strong water to make trouble
between men. Gian-nah-tah is a fool to be tricked thus by the
pindah-lickoyee."</p>

<p>"Yes," agreed Gian-nah-tah, "I am a fool."</p>

<p>Shoz-Dijiji scratched some criss-cross lines upon the ground
where he squatted. With a bit of stick he scratched them.</p>

<p>"These," he said, "are the troubles that have come between
Shoz-Dijiji and Gian-nah-tah&mdash;the bad talk&mdash;the bad
thoughts."</p>

<p>With his palm he smoothed the ground.</p>

<p>"Now they are gone," he said. "Let us forget them." He offered
Gian-nah-tah a piece of venison, and his friend squatted beside
him.</p>

<p>"Do you think the soldiers of the white-eyed men will follow
us?" asked Gian-nah-tah.</p>

<p>Shoz-Dijiji shook his head. "I do not know," he replied. "I
offered hoddentin to the winds and to the night, and I prayed that
Usen would make the hearts of the pindah-lickoyee good that they
might return to their own country and leave us in peace.</p>

<p>"I asked the tzi-daltai that Nan-ta-do-tash blessed for me if
the white-eyed soldiers were pursuing us, but I have received no
answer."</p>

<p>"Nan-tan-des-la-par-en said that if we did not come with him he
would follow us and kill us all if it took fifty years," reminded
Gian-nah-tah.</p>

<p>Shoz-Dijiji laughed. "That is just talk," he said. "Anyone can
make big talk. For over three hundred years we have been fighting
the pindah-lickoyee; and they have not killed us all, yet. Some day
they will, but it will take more than fifty years. You and I shall
have plenty of fighting before the last of the Shis-Inday is
killed."</p>

<p>"I do not know," said Gian-nah-tah. "A spirit came to me while I
slept the first night that we camped near the soldiers of
Nan-tan-des-la-par-en. It was the spirit of my father. He said that
he had waited a long time for me. He said that pretty soon I would
come. I asked him when; but just then I awoke, and that frightened
him away. Perhaps it will be tomorrow&mdash;who knows?"</p>

<p>"Do not say that, Gian-nah-tah," said Shoz-Dijiji. "Already have
I seen too many of my friends go. One hundred and thirty four we
were when we went out from San Carlos less than twelve moons ago.
Today we are thirty eight. The others are dead, or prisoners of the
pindah-lickoyee. The heart of Shoz-Dijiji is sad, as are the hearts
of all Apaches. The hand of every man is against us&mdash;even the
hands of our brothers. We must not think of death. Gian-nah-tah and
Shoz-Dijiji must live for one another. Surely Usen will not take
everything that we love from us!"</p>

<p>"Usen has forgotten the Apache," said Gian-nah-tah, sadly.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>For a month the renegades rested and recuperated in the high
sierras, and then one day a scout brought word to Geronimo that he
had sighted three troops of United States Cavalry as they were
going into camp a day's march to the north.</p>

<p>Geronimo shook his head. "They are always talking of peace," he
said, "and always making war upon us. They will not leave us
alone." He turned to Shoz-Dijiji. "Go to the camp of the
pindah-lickoyee and try to talk with some of their scouts. Take
Gian-nah-tah with you. Do not trust too much in the honor of the
scouts, but learn all that you can without telling them
anything."</p>

<p>Shoz-Dijiji and Gian-nah-tah arose. "That is all?" asked the
young war chief of the Be-don-ko-he.</p>

<p>"That is all," replied Geronimo. The soft rustle of their war
moccasins faded into silence. The night swallowed them. Geronimo
sat with bowed head, his eyes upon the ground.</p>

<p>A girl looked after them and sighed. Then she cast hoddentin in
the direction they had gone and whispered prayers for the safety of
one of them. Also she prayed that some day she would be the mother
of warriors and that Gian-nah-tah would be their father.</p>

<p><br>
In four hours the two warriors covered the distance that it would
take a troop of cavalry all of the following day to cover; but they
travelled where no horse might travel, over trails that no
cavalryman knew. They trod in places where only mountain sheep and
Apaches had trod before.</p>

<p><br>
Quiet lay upon the camp of &mdash;th Cavalry. Three weary sentries;
softly cursing because they must walk their posts to save their
horses, circled the lonely bivouac. At a little distance lay the
camp of the Apache scouts. The dismal voice of an owl broke the
silence. It came from the summit of a low bluff south of the camp.
At intervals it was repeated twice.</p>

<p>One of the sentries was a rookie. "Gosh," he soliloquized, "but
that's a lonesome sound!"</p>

<p>Once more came the eerie cry&mdash;this time, apparently, from
the camp of the scouts.</p>

<p>Number One sentry was a veteran. He stepped quickly from his
post to the side of his top sergeant, who lay wrapped in a sweaty
saddle blanket with his head on a McClellan.</p>

<p>"H-s-st! McGuire!" he whispered.</p>

<p>"Wot the' ell?" demanded the sergeant, sitting up.</p>

<p>"Hostiles! I just heard 'em signalling to our
Siwashes&mdash;three owl calls and an answer."</p>

<p>The sergeant came to his feet, strapping his belt about his
hips. He picked up his carbine. "Git back on your post an' keep
your ears unbuttoned," he directed. "I'll mosey out that way a bit
an' listen. Maybe it was a owl."</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>Shoz-Dijiji and Gian-nah-tah crept silently down the face of the
bluff and approached the camp of the scouts. There was no moon, and
light clouds obscured the stars. It was very dark. A figure loomed
suddenly before them. "Who are you?" it demanded in a whisper that
could not have been heard ten feet away.</p>

<p>"We are Be-don-ko-he," replied Shoz-Dijiji. "We bring a message
from Geronimo."</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"He wants the soldiers to go back to their own country and leave
him alone. He is not fighting the pindah-lickoyee. If they will go
away he will not again raid in Arizona or New Mexico."</p>

<p>"You are Shoz-Dijiji," said the scout "I am glad you came. We
have word for Geronimo and all that are with him. His fight is
hopeless. He had better come in. If he does, perhaps they will not
kill him. If he stays out he is sure to be killed. Every one of his
warriors will be killed. Tell him to come in."</p>

<p>"Why do you think we will be killed? They have not killed us
yet, and they have been trying to ever since we were born."</p>

<p>"Now they will," insisted the scout, "for they have offered to
pay fifty dollars for the head of every warrior that is brought in
and two thousand dollars for the head of Geronimo. There are
Apaches who would kill their own fathers for fifty dollars."</p>

<p>"You do not kill us," said Shoz-Dijiji, "and our heads are worth
one hundred dollars."</p>

<p>"Give thanks to Usen, then, that he sent me to meet you and not
another," replied the scout.</p>

<p>"What are the plans of the pindah-lickoyee?" asked
Shoz-Dijiji.</p>

<p>"Their orders are to get Geronimo and all his band. The Mexicans
are helping them. It was the Mexicans who invited them down here to
catch you."</p>

<p>"They shall pay," growled Shoz-Dijiji.</p>

<p>"So old Nan-tan-des-la-par-en will pay fifty dollars for my
head, eh?" said Gian-nah-tah. "Very well, I shall go and get his
head for nothing."</p>

<p>"It was not Nan-tan-des-la-par-en," said the scout. "He is no
longer war chief of the pindah-lickoyee. They have taken him away
and sent another. His name is Miles. It is he who has offered the
money for your heads. He has ordered out many soldiers to follow
you and catch you. Here there are three troops of the &mdash;th
Cavalry; Lawton is coming with Apache scouts, cavalry, and
infantry. As fast as men and horses are tired they will send fresh
ones to replace them. A few men cannot fight against so many and
win. That is why so many of us have joined the scouts. It is not
that we love the white-eyed ones any better than you do. We know
when we are beaten&mdash;that is all. We would live in peace. By
going out you make trouble for us all. We want to put an end to all
this trouble."</p>

<p>"I, too, like peace," said Shoz-Dijiji; "but better even than
peace I like freedom. If you are content to be the slave of the
pindah-lickoyee that is your own affair. Shoz-Dijiji would rather
be forever on the war trail than be a slave. If you are men you
will leave the service of the white-eyes and join Geronimo."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Gian-nah-tah, "take that message to our brothers who
have turned against us."</p>

<p>"Come!" said Shoz-Dijiji, and the two warriors turned back
toward the camp of Geronimo.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>1st Sergeant McGuire, "K" Troop, &mdash;th Cavalry strolled back
to his blankets. On the way he paused to speak to Number One. "The
next time you hear a owl," he said, "you just telegraph President
Cleveland and let me sleep."</p>

<p><br>
Chigo-na-ay was an hour high when Shoz-Dijiji and Gian-nah-tah
stood again before the rude hogan of Geronimo deep hid upon the
rough breast of the Mother of Mountains. The old war chief listened
in silence while they narrated with primitive fidelity every detail
of their interview with the scout.</p>

<p>"Fifty dollars for the head of a warrior, two thousand dollars
for the head of Geronimo!" he exclaimed. "It is thus that they
offer a bounty for the heads of wolves and coyotes. They treat us
as beasts and expect us to treat them as men. When they war among
themselves do they offer money for the head of an enemy? No! They
reserve that insult for the Apache.</p>

<p>"They will win because Usen has deserted us. And when they have
killed us all there will be none to stop them from stealing the
rest of our land. That is what they want. That is why they make
treaties with us and then break them, to drive us upon the war
trail that they may have an excuse to kill us faster. That is why
they offer money for our heads.</p>

<p>"Oh, Usen! What have the Shis-Inday done that you should be
angry with them and let their enemies destroy them?"</p>

<p>"Do not waste your breath praying to Usen," said Gian-nah-tah.
"Pray to the God of the pindah-lickoyee. He is stronger than
Usen."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you are right," said Geronimo, sadly. "He is a wicked
God, but his medicine is stronger than the medicine of Usen."</p>

<p>"I," said Shoz-Dijiji, "shall pray always to the god of my
fathers. I want nothing of the pindah-lickoyee or their god. I hate
them all."</p>

<p>A brave, moving at an easy run, approached the camp and stopped
before Geronimo.</p>

<p>"Soldiers are coming," he said. "Their scouts have followed the
tracks of Shoz-Dijiji and Gian-nah-tah."</p>

<p>"Only Apaches could trail us," said Geronimo. "If our brothers
had remained loyal and taken the war trail with us the
pindah-lickoyee could not conquer us in a thousand rains."</p>

<p>"There is a place where we can meet them," said the brave who
had brought the word, "and stop them."</p>

<p>"I know," replied Geronimo. He called four warriors to him.
"Take the women and the boys," he said, "and cross over the summit
to the burned pine by the first water. Those of us who live will
join you there after the battle."</p>

<p>Stripped to breech-cloth and moccasins, eighteen painted savages
filed silently through the rough mountains. A scout preceded them.
Behind Geronimo walked the Apache Devil, his blue face banded with
white. Stern, grim, terrible men these&mdash;hunted as beasts are
hunted, retaliating as only a cornered beast
retaliates&mdash;asking no quarter and giving none.</p>

<p>Equipped by civilization with the best of weapons and plenty of
ammunition and by nature with high intelligence, courage, and
shrewdness they had every advantage except that of numbers over any
enemy that might take the field against them.</p>

<p>They stopped the &mdash;th Cavalry that day as they had stopped
other troops before and without the loss of a man, and with the
coming of night had vanished among the rocks of their beloved
mountains and rejoined their women in the new camp by the burned
pine at the first water beyond the summit.</p>

<p>Stern, grim, relentless, the cavalry pursued. Cooperating with
them were the troops of Governor Torres of Sonora. The renegades
were hard pressed. Skirmishes were of almost daily occurrence now.
And then Lawton came with his hand-picked force of seasoned
veterans.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>It was May again. For a year this handful of savage warriors and
women and children had defied, eluded, and ofttimes defeated the
forces of two civilized nations. The military strategy of their
leader had been pitted against that of a great American general and
proved superior. A score of West Pointers had exhausted their every
resource and failed, but they were at last nearing their
goal&mdash;victory seemed imminent. Miles and Lawton would receive
the plaudits of their countrymen; and yet, if the truth were known,
Miles and Lawton might have continued to pursue Geronimo and his
band to the day of their deaths, and without success, had it not
been that Apache turned against Apache.</p>

<p>The Shis-Inday may date the beginning of the end from the day
that the first Indian Scouts were organized.</p>

<p>Hunted relentlessly, given no opportunity to rest because their
every haunt, their every trail, their every hiding place was as
well known to the scouts who pursued them as it was to themselves,
they found themselves at last practically surrounded.</p>

<p>With no opportunity to hunt they were compelled to kill their
ponies for sustenance until at last only Nejeunee was left.</p>

<p>Geronimo sat in council after a day of running battle.</p>

<p>"The warriors of the pindah-lickoyee and the Mexicans are all
about us," he said. "If we can break through and cross the
mountains into Chihuahua perhaps we can escape them. Then we must
separate and go in different directions. They will hear of us here
today and there tomorrow. They will hurry from one place to
another. Their horses will become tired and their soldiers
footsore. Their force will be broken up into small parties. It will
be easier for us to elude them. Tonight we shall move east. A camp
of the enemy lies directly in our path, but if we can pass it
before dawn we shall be in mountains where no cavalry can follow
and tomorrow we shall be in Chihuahua.</p>

<p>"There is one pony left. Its meat will carry us through until we
can find cattle in Chihuahua."</p>

<p>There was silence. Every warrior, every woman knew that
Shoz-Dijiji had repeatedly refused to permit the killing of the
little pinto stallion for food.</p>

<p>"Nejeunee is more than a war pony," Shoz-Dijiji had once said to
Geronimo. "He is my friend. I will not eat my friend. Nor permit
anyone to eat my friend."</p>

<p>Glances stole around the circle in search of Shoz-Dijiji. He was
not there.</p>

<p><br>
Up toward the camp of the enemy&mdash;the camp that stood between
the renegades and Chihuahua&mdash;a painted warrior rode a pinto
stallion. A gentle May wind blew down to the nostrils of the man
and his mount. To Nejeunee it carried the scent of his kind from
the picket line of the &mdash;th Cavalry. He pricked up his ears
and nickered. Shoz-Dijiji slid from his back, slipped the primitive
bridle from about his lower jaw and slapped him on the rump.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, Nejeunee," he whispered; "the pindah-lickoyee may
kill you, but they will not eat you."</p>

<p>Slowly the Apache walked back toward the camp of his people.
Like the stones upon the grave of Ish-kay-nay, many and heavy, his
sorrows lay upon his heart.</p>

<p>"Perhaps, after all," he mused, "Gian-nah-tah is right and Usen
has forgotten the Apaches. I have prayed to him in the high places;
I have offered hoddentin to him upon the winds of the morning and
the evening; I have turned a deaf ear to the enemies who bring us a
new god. Yet one by one the friends that I love are taken from me.
Oh, Usen, before they are all gone take Shoz-Dijiji! Do not leave
him alone without friends in a world filled with enemies!"</p>

<p><br>
"Where is Shoz-Dijiji?" demanded Geronimo, his blue eyes sweeping
the circle before him. "Gian-nah-tah, where is Shoz-Dijiji?"</p>

<p>"Here is Shoz-Dijiji!" said a voice from the darkness; and as
they looked up, the war chief of the Be-don-ko-he stepped into the
dim, flickering light of their tiny fire.</p>

<p>"Shoz-Dijiji," said Geronimo, "there is but one pony left. It is
Nejeunee. He must be killed for food. The others are all gone."</p>

<p>"Nejeunee is gone, also," said Shoz-Dijiji.</p>

<p>"Gone?"</p>

<p>"I have told you many times that no one would ever eat Nejeunee
while Shoz-Dijiji lived. I have taken him away. What are you going
to do about it?"</p>

<p>Geronimo bowed his head. "Even my son has turned against me," he
said, sadly.</p>

<p>"Those are not true words, Geronimo," replied Shoz-Dijiji.
"Nejeunee was more to me than a great war pony. When Shoz-Dijiji
was a youth and Nejeunee a colt, Shoz-Dijiji broke him. Little
Ish-kay-nay rode upon his back. It was Nejeunee that was tied
before the hogan of her father. It was Nejeunee that Ish-kay-nay
led to water and fed the next morning. Nejeunee has carried me
through many battles. His fleet feet have borne me from the
clutches of many an enemy. He has been the friend of Shoz-Dijiji as
well as his war pony. Now he is old and yet there is not a fleeter
or braver pony in the land of the Shis-Inday. He deserves better of
me than to be killed and eaten.</p>

<p>"Geronimo says that Shoz-Dijiji has turned against him. Every
day Shoz-Dijiji offers his life for Geronimo, and all that he has
asked in return is the life of his friend."</p>

<p>"Say no more," said Na-chi-ta, the son of Cochise. "Let
Shoz-Dijiji have the life of his friend. We have been hungry
before&mdash;we can be hungry again. It does not kill an Apache to
be hungry. We are not pindah-lickoyee."</p>

<h2><a name="chap11" id="chap11">XI. &mdash; A RED HERO</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">DAWN was breaking as the last of the renegades
crept past the camp of the enemy, where the troopers, already astir
an hour, stood to horse. It was known that the camp of the
renegades lay just below them, surrounded. A sudden, surprise
sortie at dawn would either overwhelm them or send them scattering
into the arms of other troops stationed to cut off their retreat in
any direction. It began to look as though Geronimo and his band
were to be wiped out or captured at last. Two scouts had gone down
toward the camp of the Apaches to investigate. The commanding
officer was impatiently awaiting their return. Presently it would
be too light for a surprise attack.</p>

<p>The officers were congratulating their commander and themselves
upon the nice work that had brought old Geronimo into a trap at
last&mdash;a trap from which he could not conceivably escape. They
were also talking about the pinto stallion that had wandered up to
their picket line during the night.</p>

<p>"I know that pony, sir," said Lieutenant King to the commanding
officer, "and I know the Indian who owns him&mdash;he saved my life
once. If it is possible, sir, I should like very much to take the
pony back to Arizona with me. There is a rancher there whom I
believe would be very glad to have him and take care of him."</p>

<p>"Well, it's not exactly regular, Mr. King, but perhaps the pony
was stolen from this rancher&mdash;eh?" the C. O. grinned.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," agreed King.</p>

<p>"Very well, you may return it to its owner."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir!"</p>

<p>"Here are the scouts," said the C. O. "Return to your troops,
and be ready to move out at once!"</p>

<p>Two Apaches approached the commanding officer. They wore the red
head-bands of government scouts.</p>

<p>"Well?" demanded the officer. "Did you find Geronimo?"</p>

<p>"Him gone," said one of the scouts.</p>

<p>"Gone! Where in hell has he gone?"</p>

<p>"Mebby so there," he pointed to the canyon behind them.</p>

<p>"Hell! He couldn't have gone there. What do you suppose we been
doing here?"</p>

<p>"Me no sabe," replied the Apache. "Him gone&mdash;there!"</p>

<p>"How do you know?"</p>

<p>"Me follow tracks."</p>

<p>"You sure?"</p>

<p>"Sure!"</p>

<p>"How long?"</p>

<p>"Mebby so half hour."</p>

<p>The officer turned to his chief of scouts. "Did you hear that?
Slipped through our fingers again. The old devil! Get after him at
once. Pick up the trail. Keep after him. We'll follow. If you get
in touch with him don't attack. Just keep in touch with him until
we come up."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir!"</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>Two scouts preceded Geronimo's little band up the canyon that
would take them to the summit and over into Chihuahua. Precipitous
walls hemmed them in on both sides, effectually keeping them to the
bottom of the canyon. Here the going was good; but, also, it would
be good going for horses and no escape for the fleeing renegades
should they be overtaken. They were marching rapidly, needing no
urging, for each of them knew the life and death necessity for
speed.</p>

<p>Behind the two scouts came the women and the two boys. All the
fighting men except the two scouts were in the rear. A little
behind the others came Gian-nah-tah and three fellows. These would
be the first to sight the enemy and give the word that would permit
the main body to take a position from which they might best offer a
defense. But half a mile remained of level going; then the canyon
proper terminated in tumbled, terraced ledges leading upward among
great boulders and tortured strata toward the summit that was their
goal. Once they reached these ledges no cavalry could pursue.</p>

<p><br>
The commanding officer of the pursuing &mdash;th knew this and sent
one troop ahead with orders to overtake the renegades at all costs
before they reached the sanctuary of those rock strewn ledges. With
clanking accouterments and the clash of iron shod hoofs on rocky
ground "B" Troop galloped up the canyon, close upon the heels of
the Apache scouts.</p>

<p>Just beyond a turn the canyon narrowed, the beetling cliffs
approaching close and the rubble at their base leaving a level path
scarce ten feet wide. It was at this point that Gian-nah-tah
sighted the leading scout. A half mile more and the renegades would
have been safe&mdash;just a few minutes and the women and the main
body could all be hidden among the boulders at the top of the first
terrace, where a thousand cavalrymen could not dislodge them.</p>

<p>Gian-nah-tah turned and fired at the first red banded scout.
Beyond the scout Gian-nah-tah now saw the leading horsemen of "B"
Troop rounding the turn in the canyon.</p>

<p>He called to one of his fellows. "Go to Geronimo," he said.
"Tell him to hurry. Gian-nah-tah can hold them off until all are
among the rocks."</p>

<p>He knelt upon the red blanket he had thrown off when battle
seemed imminent and took careful aim. His shot brought down the
horse of a cavalryman. With loud yells "B" Troop came tearing on.
Those who rode in front fired as they charged. A bullet passed
through Gian-nah-tah's shoulder. The Apache fired rapidly, but he
could not stem that avalanche of plunging horses and yelling
men.</p>

<p>Another bullet passed through his chest; but still he knelt
there, firing; holding the pass while his people fled to safety.
The leading troopers were almost upon him. In an instant he would
be ridden down! But he had not held them yet! If they passed him
now they would overtake the little band before it won to
safety.</p>

<p>He dropped his rifle and seizing the red blanket in both hands
arose and waved it in the faces of the oncoming horses. They
swerved&mdash;they turned, stumbling and plunging among the loose
rock of the rubble heaps. Two fell and others piled upon them. For
minutes&mdash;precious minutes&mdash;all was confusion; then they
came on again. And again Gian-nah-tah flourished the red blanket in
the faces of the horses, almost from beneath their feet. Again the
frightened animals wheeled and fought to escape. Once again there
was delay.</p>
<a id="pic3" name="pic3"><!--Image Anchor--></a><br>

<div align="center"><img src="0300271h-images/ApacheDevil-03.jpg"
alt="Illustration" title="Illustration">
<p class="caption">Gian-nah-tah flourished the red blanket in the
faces of the horses.</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>Another bullet pierced Gian-nah-tah's body. Weak from loss of
blood and from the shock of wounds he could no longer stand,
kneeling, he held the pass against fifty men. A fourth bullet
passed through him&mdash;through his right lung&mdash;and, coughing
blood, he turned them back again. Through the yelling and the chaos
of the fight the troop commander had been trying to extricate
himself from the melee and call his men back. Finally he succeeded.
The troop was drawn off a few yards.</p>

<p>"Sergeant," said the captain, "dismount and use your carbine on
that fellow. Don't miss!"</p>

<p>Gian-nah-tah, kneeling, saw what they were doing, but he did not
care. He had held them. His people were safe!</p>

<p>The sergeant knelt and took careful aim.</p>

<p>"Usen has remembered his people at last," whispered
Gian-nah-tah.</p>

<p>The sergeant pressed his trigger; and Gian-nah-tah fell forward
on his face, a bullet through his brain. When Captain Cullis led
his troop through that narrow pass a moment later he saluted as he
passed the dead body of a courageous enemy.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>That night Geronimo camped beyond the summit, in the State of
Chihuahua. Shoz-Dijiji sat in silence, his head bowed. No one
mentioned the name of Gian-nah-tah. None of them had seen him die,
but they knew that he was dead. He alone was missing. A girl, lying
upon her blanket, sobbed quietly through the night.</p>

<p><br>
In the morning the band separated into small parties and,
scattering, led the pursuing troops upon many wild and fruitless
chases. Geronimo, with six men and four women, started north toward
the United States. Shoz-Dijiji, silent, morose, was one of the
party.</p>

<p>Even these small bands often broke up for a day or two into
other, smaller parties. Often the men hunted alone, but always
there were meeting places designated ahead. Thus Geronimo and his
companions ranged slowly northward through Chihuahua.</p>

<p><br>
Cutting wood in the mountains near Casa Grande in Sonora had become
too hazardous an occupation since Geronimo had been ranging the
country; and so Luis Mariel, the son of Pedro Mariel, the
woodchopper of Casa Grande, had come over into Chihuahua to look
for other work.</p>

<p>He had never cared to be a woodchopper, but longed, as a youth
will, for the picturesque and romantic life of a vaquero; and at
last, here in Chihuahua, his ambition had been gratified and today,
with three other vaqueros, he was helping guard a grazing herd upon
the lower slopes of the Sierra Madre.</p>

<p>The four were youths, starting their careers with the prosaic
duties of day herding and whiling away the hours with cigarettes
and stories. Luis was quite a hero to the others, for he alone had
participated in a real battle with Apaches. Chihuahua seemed a very
dull and humdrum country after listening to the tales that Luis
told of Apache raids and battles in wild Sonora. He told them of
the Apache Devil and boasted that he was an old friend of the
family.</p>

<p>Above the edge of a nearby arroyo unblinking eyes watched them.
The eyes appraised the four cow ponies and sized up the grazing
herd. They were stern eyes, narrowed by much exposure to the
pitiless sunlight of the southwest. They were set in a band of
white that crossed a blue face from temple to temple. They
scrutinized Luis Mariel and recognized him, but their expression
did not change.</p>

<p>The Apache saw before him horses that he and his friends needed;
he saw food on the hoof, and Usen knew that they needed food; he
saw the enemies of his people, anyone of whom would shoot him down
on sight, had they the opportunity. But it was he who had the
opportunity!</p>

<p>He levelled his rifle and fired. A vaquero cried out and fell
from his saddle. The others looked about, drawing their pistols.
Shoz-Dijiji fired again and another vaquero fell. Now the two
remaining had located the smoke of his rifle and returned his
fire.</p>

<p>Shoz-Dijiji dropped below the edge of the arroyo and ran quickly
to a new position. When his eyes again peered above the edge of his
defense he saw the two galloping toward his former position. He
appreciated their bravery and realized their foolhardiness as he
dropped his rifle quickly on one of them and pressed the trigger;
then he quickly tied a white rag to the muzzle of his smoking rifle
and waved it above the edge of the arroyo, though he was careful
not to expose any more of his person than was necessary.</p>

<p>Luis Mariel looked in astonishment. What could it mean? A voice
called him by name.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" demanded Luis, whose better judgment prompted him
to put spurs to his horse and leave the victors in possession of
the field.</p>

<p>"I am a friend," replied Shoz-Dijiji. "We shall not harm you if
you will throw down your pistol. If you do not we can shoot you
before you can get away."</p>

<p>Luis appreciated the truth of this statement. Further, he
thought that his enemies must number several men; also&mdash;he did
not know that he who addressed him was not a Mexican, for the
Spanish was quite as good as Luis' own. So he threw down his
pistol, being assured by this time that they had been attacked by
bandits who wished only to steal the herd. Perhaps they would
invite him to join the band, and when was there ever a red-blooded
youth who did not at some time in his career aspire to be a brigand
or a pirate?</p>

<p>A painted face appeared above the arroyo's edge. "Mother of
God!" cried Luis, "protect me."</p>

<p>The Apache sprang quickly to level ground and came toward the
youth.</p>

<p>"The Apache Devil!" exclaimed Luis.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Shoz-Dijiji, stooping and picking up Luis' pistol.
"I shall not harm you, if you will do as I tell you."</p>

<p>"Won't the others kill me?" asked the youth.</p>

<p>"There are no others," replied Shoz-Dijiji.</p>

<p>"But you said 'we,'" explained Luis.</p>

<p>"I am alone."</p>

<p>"What do you want me to do?"</p>

<p>"Round up those three horses and then help me drive this herd to
my camp."</p>

<p>"You will not harm me, nor let your friends harm me?"</p>

<p>"Have I harmed you or your father in the past?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Do as I tell you then," said Shoz-Dijiji, "and you will not be
killed."</p>

<p>Luis rode after the three horses which were now grazing with the
herd that had been but momentarily disturbed by the shots. When he
returned with them the two men, each leading one of the riderless
animals, started the cattle slowly toward the north in the
direction of the next meeting place of Geronimo's party after
Shoz-Dijiji had collected the arms and ammunition that had belonged
to Luis and his three companions and secured them to the saddle of
the horse led by the Apache.</p>

<p>Shoz-Dijiji rode in silence. If he felt any elation because of
the success of his adventure it was not apparent in his demeanor.
Grim, morose, he herded the cattle onward. His eyes patrolled the
world bounded by the horizon, searching for enemies.</p>

<p>Luis Mariel, partly frightened, wholly thrilled, glanced often
at his companion. To ride with the Apache Devil&mdash;ah, what an
adventure. From earliest childhood Luis' ears had been filled with
the stories of Apache ferocity, treachery, cruelty, yet against
these were set the knowledge that the Apache Devil had twice
befriended his father and had once before befriended him. Perhaps
the Apache Devil would not harm him, then; but what of the
others?</p>

<p>He had heard hideous stories of the tortures inflicted by the
Apaches upon their prisoners. It might be that the Apache Devil
could not protect him from the ferocity of his fellows. This
thought worried Luis and to such effect that he commenced to
formulate plans for escape. If they did not come to the camp of the
Indians before dark his chances would be better than to risk making
a break for liberty in the face of the menace of the Apache Devil's
marksmanship, which he had reason to know constituted a very real
menace.</p>

<p>The afternoon wore on. Angry clouds, gathering in the sky,
portended early darkness and a black night. The patient herd
plodded slowly on. The hopes of Luis Mariel rose high. Two hours
more and escape would be assured if, in the meantime, they did not
reach the camp of the Apaches.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>"B" Troop of the &mdash;th had been dispatched into Chihuahua in
the search for the scattered bands of the marauding renegades.
Lieutenant Samuel Adams King, with four troopers, was scouting far
afield. He had been following what appeared to be a fresh, though
faint, Indian track that led toward the north; but now, with night
coming down and a storm threatening, he had lost it. While one of
the troopers held the horses of the others, King and his remaining
men searched on foot for the elusive spoor. Proceeding in different
directions the four walked slowly, scrutinizing every inch of
ground, searching for a turned pebble, a down-pressed spear of
vegetation, King's path took him through a deep arroyo and out upon
the opposite bank. Absorbed in his search he took no note of the
growing menace of the gathering storm nor of the distance,
constantly increasing, between himself and his men. He knew that
when the rain came it would wipe out all trace of the tracks they
sought, and this knowledge constituted the urge that kept him
oblivious to all other considerations.</p>

<p><br>
The dusk of evening had fallen. Heavy clouds rolled angrily and low
above the scene as a herd of cattle slowly topped a gentle rise to
the south. Two men drove them, but only one of these saw the
soldiers a couple of miles ahead&mdash;saw, and knew them for what
they were. This one glanced quickly at the landscape ahead and at
the gathering storm above. He knew that it was about to break. He
knew, too, that the arroyo would soon be filled with muddy, raging
water&mdash;a barrier impassable by man or beast. All but one of
the soldiers would be upon the opposite side of the arroyo from the
herd and him.</p>

<p>Knowing these things, Shoz-Dijiji urged the cattle onward in the
general direction of the enemy, for even though he passed close to
them they would be unable to see him after the rain came&mdash;the
rain and night.</p>

<p>Luis Mariel viewed the prospect of the impending storm
hopefully. Soon it would be dark, but even before that the blinding
rain would obliterate all objects within a few yards of him. They
had not yet come to the camp of the renegades, and Luis had a horse
under him.</p>

<p>The storm was in their rear. The cattle, doubtless, would move
on before it; but Luis would turn back into it, and when it had
passed he would be safely beyond the ken of the Apache Devil.</p>

<p>A great cloud! black and ominous, bellied low above them,
sagging as though to a great weight of water; jagged lightning shot
through it, followed by a deafening crash of thunder; the rent
cloud spewed its contents upon the earth. It was not rain; it did
not fall in drops nor sheets but in a great mass of solid
water.</p>

<p><br>
With the bursting of the cloud King found himself in water a foot
deep on the level, and afterward the rain fell in torrents that
shut everything from view beyond a few yards. Lightning flashed and
thunder roared, and the pounding of the rain between drowned all
other sounds. The man floundered through the new made mud back in
the direction of his men. All was water&mdash;above, below, around
him. Suddenly there appeared before him, almost at his feet, a
depression. Here the water swirled and eddied, running in a mighty
current across his path.</p>

<p>At its very edge he stopped and, realizing what it was,
staggered back a few steps&mdash;back from the brink of eternity.
So close had he been to the shelving bank of the arroyo that
another step might have hurled him into the racing, yellow flood
that filled it now from brim to brim.</p>

<p><br>
Disconcerted by the first great mass of water that fell upon them,
the cattle stopped. The leaders turned back upon the herd.
Shoz-Dijiji, in the rear, urged the stragglers forward until,
presently, the herd was milling in a muddy circle; but with the
coming of the steady torrent and beneath the heavy quirt of the
Apache they gradually strung out again in the direction they had
been travelling, the storm at their backs.</p>

<p>Shoz-Dijiji, seeing that he was handling the herd alone, looked
about him for his companion; but the blinding torrent hid
everything but the nearer cattle, and Shoz-Dijiji did not know that
Luis was driving his unwilling pony into the teeth of the storm in
an effort to escape.</p>

<p>An hour later the storm was over. A full moon shone out of a
clear sky. Directly ahead of him Shoz-Dijiji saw something that was
frightening the leaders of the herd, causing them to stop and then
turn aside. A moment later the Apache recognized the cause of the
distraction. It was a man on foot. At first Shoz-Dijiji thought
that it was Luis, but when he had ridden nearer he discovered that
the man was a soldier. Shoz-Dijiji drew a revolver from the holster
at his hip. He would ride close enough to make sure of his aim
before firing. He was not afraid that the other would fire first,
since the soldier, before he fired, would wish to make sure that
Shoz-Dijiji was an enemy. In this Shoz-Dijiji had a great
advantage. Being an Apache he knew that all men were his enemies.
He could make no mistake on that score.</p>

<p>The soldier hailed him in rather lame Spanish, but there was
something in the voice that sounded familiar to the Apache Devil
who never forgot anything. So he rode yet closer.</p>

<p>And then, in perfectly understandable English, he said: "Put up
your hands, King, or I'll kill you."</p>

<p>Lieutenant King put his hands above his head. As yet he had not
recognized the other as an Indian. The English, the use of his own
name, mystified him.</p>

<p>"Who the hell are you?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"Turn your back," commanded Shoz-Dijiji. King did as he was bid,
and the Apache rode up and disarmed him.</p>

<p>"All right," said Shoz-Dijiji, after King lowered his arms and
turned about.</p>

<p>"Shoz-Dijiji!" exclaimed King.</p>

<p>"Shoz-Dijiji, war chief of the Be-don-ko-he Apaches," replied
the Apache Devil.</p>

<p>"And you're on the war path. That doesn't look so good for me,
does it, Shoz-Dijiji?"</p>

<p>"Shoz-Dijiji not on war trail now. Shoz-Dijiji good Indian now.
Go in cattle business."</p>

<p>In the moonlight King saw the grim half smile that accompanied
the words of the Indian, but he made no reply. Apache humor was
something that he did not pretend to understand. All he knew about
it was that upon occasion it might be hideous.</p>

<p>"Mebbe so you like go in cattle business with Shoz-Dijiji?"
suggested the Apache.</p>

<p>"I guess that whatever you say goes," replied the officer.</p>

<p>"All right. Take this horse." The Indian indicated the led horse
at his side. "Now you help drive <i>our</i> cattle. Sabe?"</p>

<p>King grinned. "Perfectly," he said. Slowly the two men urged the
cattle onward until at dawn they came to a patch of meadow land
well within the mountain range they had entered shortly after
meeting. There was water there and good grazing and little
likelihood that the tired animals would wander far from either.</p>

<p>Taking King with him, Shoz-Dijiji rode to the top of a high hill
that commanded the broad valley to the south and west, across which
they had come. For half an hour the Apache scanned the country
below them, using field glasses that King recognized as having once
belonged to him, glasses that had been taken from him several years
before during an engagement with hostiles.</p>

<p>In the far distance the Indian saw a tiny speck and recognized
it as Luis. Beyond Luis and approaching him from the southeast were
horsemen. This was doubtless the company of soldiers to which King
belonged. Shoz-Dijiji did not call the officer's attention to
either Luis or the soldiers. In his mind he figured quickly just
how long it would take the soldiers to reach this point should Luis
put them upon the trail of the herd, which he knew that they could
easily pick up and follow from the point at which the storm had
overtaken them.</p>

<p>"Come," he said to King, and the two rode down from the hill and
turned into a small canyon where they would be hidden from the view
of anyone who might enter the meadow where the cattle grazed. In
the canyon was a small spring and here they drank. Shoz-Dijiji
proffered King a piece of jerked venison that stunk to high heaven,
but the officer assured the Apache that he was not hungry.</p>

<p>Having eaten, Shoz-Dijiji bound King's wrists and ankles. "Now
sleep," he said. He stretched himself nearby and was soon asleep,
but it was some time before King fell into a fitful doze. When he
awoke, the Indian was removing the bonds from his wrists.</p>

<p>"Now we drive our cattle," said Shoz-Dijiji. The balance of that
day and all the following night they drove the weary beasts through
the mountains. There was no pursuit. After their sleep Shoz-Dijiji
had again taken King to the hill top and scanned the back trail.
The dust of a cavalry troop could be faintly seen in the distance,
but it was moving north parallel to the range they had entered and
was not upon their trail.</p>

<p>Twice they had stopped for brief rests, not for themselves but
for the cattle; and now, at dawn, the trail debouched into an open
canyon where there was water and good feed. At the edge of the
pasture land Shoz-Dijiji drew rein and pointed up the canyon.</p>

<p>"There," he said to King, "is the camp of Geronimo. If you go
there you will be killed. Mebbe so you like sell your half of the
cattle business?"</p>

<p>King grinned. "What do you mean?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Shoz-Dijiji buy," replied the Apache. "He give you a horse and
your life. You sell?"</p>

<p>"You've bought some cattle, Shoz-Dijiji," exclaimed King; "but I
can't understand you. You are not like any other Indian I ever
heard of. Why have you done this?"</p>

<p>"Two men drive cattle easier than one," replied the Apache.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know that; but why are you giving me a chance to escape
when you know that I'll go right back to chasing you and fighting
you again? Is it because of Wichita Billings?"</p>

<p>"Shoz-Dijiji no sabe English," grunted the Indian. "Now you go!"
and he pointed back down the canyon along the trail they had just
come over.</p>

<p>King wheeled his horse around. "Good-bye, Shoz-Dijiji," he said.
"Perhaps some day I can repay you."</p>

<p>"Wait!" said the Indian and handed the white man his pistol.
Then he sat his horse watching until a turn in the canyon took the
other from his sight.</p>

<p><br>
Far away Luis Mariel rode with "B" Troop of the &mdash;th. He had
not led the soldiers upon the trail of his friend, the Apache
Devil.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="chap12" id="chap12">XII. &mdash; "SHOZ-DIJIJI
KNOWS!"</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">LUIS MARIEL had attached himself to "B" Troop. He
rode with it, made himself generally useful around camp; and, in
return, they fed him. Incidentally he picked up a smattering of
English that was much more effective than the original brand
formerly purveyed by Mr. Webster, and learned to ask for either
bacon or potatoes through the medium of set phrases that contained
at least ten obscene or blasphemous words and did not mention
either bacon or potatoes by their right names. He also discovered
that one may call an American anything, provided that one
smiles.</p>

<p>Much to his surprise he discovered that he liked the Gringoes,
and because he was young and bright and good natured the soldiers
liked Luis.</p>

<p>He had been with them four or five days when Lieutenant Samuel
Adams King, half starved and rather the worse for wear, rode into
camp upon an equally starved pony that Luis immediately recognized
as having formerly belonged to one of his fellow vaqueros who had
been killed by the Apache Devil.</p>

<p>Being a privileged character Luis was present when King reported
to his troop commander; and when, through the medium of much
profanity, a great deal of Spanish, and a few words of remote
English origin he had indicated that he knew something about the
pony King was riding, an interpreter was summoned and Luis told his
story to Captain Cullis and the officers accompanying him.</p>

<p>"Well, King," commented Cullis, "you have achieved all the
distinction of a museum piece. You should have a place in the
Smithsonian Institution."</p>

<p>"How so, sir?"</p>

<p>"As the only white man who ever fell into the hands of the
Apache Devil and lived to tell about it. I can't account for it.
Can you?"</p>

<p>For a moment King hesitated before he replied, and then: "No,
sir," he said, "I cannot."</p>

<p>During that instant of hesitation King had weighed his duty as
an officer against the demands of gratitude. He knew that there was
a price upon the head of the Apache Devil that might spell his
death at the hands of any white man, as an outlaw, even after peace
was restored and the renegades returned to the reservation. He was
confident that he alone knew that Shoz-Dijiji and the Apache Devil
were one and the same, provided of course that the young Mexican
was correct in his assumption that the Apache who had captured him
actually was the Apache Devil.</p>

<p>Perhaps the lad was mistaken. King determined to give
Shoz-Dijiji the benefit of the doubt. Gratitude would not permit
him to do less.</p>

<p>It being evident that some of the renegades were returning to
the United States, "B" Troop was ordered above the border; and with
it went Luis Mariel, seeking new adventures. He attached himself to
Lieutenant King and crossed the border as the officer's civilian
servant.</p>

<p>King, who had taken a liking to the lad, helped him with his
English, learned to trust him, and eventually dispatched him to the
Billings' ranch with Nejeunee and a note to Wichita Billings asking
her to take care of the little pinto war pony until King returned
from the campaign.</p>

<p>And so Luis Mariel, the son of the woodchopper of Casa Grande,
rode away; and with him went Nejeunee.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>Up into New Mexico, making their way toward the range of
mountains near Hot Springs, rode Geronimo and Shoz-Dijiji with five
other warriors and four women. They had found it necessary to
abandon the herd that Shoz-Dijiji had captured because of the
impossibility of moving it through hostile country where every
trail was patrolled by soldiers and every water hole guarded.</p>

<p>Keeping to the mountains by day, crossing the valleys under
cover of night, the eleven rode north. On several occasions they
were forced to pass cattle ranches, but they committed no
depredations other than the killing of an occasional beef for
food.</p>

<p>Their greatest hardship was shortage of water as they could not
approach the well guarded water holes and wells, and there was a
time during which they had no water for two days. They suffered
greatly, and their horses all but died from thirst.</p>

<p>Any but Apaches would have been forced to surrender under like
conditions; but, being Apaches, they knew every place where water
might be found; and so they came at last to one such place, which
was not guarded because the white men did not know of its
existence. It was hidden in the depths of a remote, parched canyon
far beneath the hard baked surface of the ground; but it was there
for the digging, and in such an unlikely spot that there was
scarcely a remote possibility that soldiers would interfere with
the digging.</p>

<p>From hill tops that commanded a view of the country in all
directions three keen eyed warriors watched while others dug for
the precious water that would give them all, and their jaded mounts
as well, a new lease on life.</p>

<p>And when they had drunk and their crude water bottles had been
refilled, they replaced the sand and the rocks in the hole they had
made; and so nicely did they erase every sign of their presence
that only an Apache might have known that they had stopped
there.</p>

<p><br>
Into their old stamping grounds they came at last; and so cleverly
had they eluded the soldiers that they ranged there in peace for
weeks, while the troops searched for them in Arizona and
Mexico.</p>

<p>Geronimo, handicapped by the paucity of his following,
nevertheless kept scouts afield who watched the movements of the
troops and kept fairly well in touch with the progress of the
campaign through the medium of friendly reservation Indians.</p>

<p>Shoz-Dijiji was often engaged in some enterprise of this nature,
and upon one occasion he went into the heart of the reservation at
San Carlos. Returning, he rode through familiar mountains along an
unmarked trail that recalled many memories of other days.</p>

<p>Shoz-Dijiji rode out of his way and against his better judgment.
He was an Apache, iron willed and schooled to self-denial; but he
was human, and so he would torture his poor heart by riding a trail
that he had once ridden with her.</p>

<p>He would ride near the ranch. Perhaps he might see her, but she
would never know that he was near.</p>

<p>The war chief of the Be-don-ko-he dreamed and, dreaming, relaxed
his vigilance. Love, sorrow, reminiscence dulled his faculties for
the moment. Otherwise he would never have been so easily surprised.
The way he had chosen led here down the steep declivity of a canyon
side and along the canyon's bottom for a few hundred yards to a
point where a nimble pony might clamber up the opposite side. It
was very hot in the sun scorched cleft and very quiet. The only
sound was the crunching of gravelly soil beneath unshod
hoofs&mdash;the hoofs of the pony Shoz-Dijiji rode down the canyon
and the hoofs of another pony bearing a rider up the canyon.</p>

<p>Perhaps chance so synchronized the gaits of the two animals that
the footfalls of each hid those of the other from the ears of their
riders. Perchance Fate&mdash;but why speculate?</p>

<p>The fact remains that as Shoz-Dijiji rounded an abrupt turn he
came face to face with the other pony and its rider. Surprise was
instantly reflected upon the face of the latter; but the Apache,
though equally surprised, let no indication of it disturb the
imperturbability of his countenance.</p>

<p>Each reined in instantly and, for a moment, sat eyeing the other
in silence. Shoz-Dijiji was the first to speak.</p>

<p>"You are alone?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Why you ride alone when the Apaches are on the war-trail?" he
asked, sternly.</p>

<p>"The Apaches are my friends. They will not harm me."</p>

<p>"Some of the Be-don-ko-he Apaches are your friends, white girl;
but there are others on the war trail who are not your friends,"
replied Shoz-Dijiji. "There are Cho-kon-en and Ned-ni with
Geronimo."</p>

<p>"Shoz-Dijiji and Geronimo would not let them harm me."</p>

<p>"Shoz-Dijiji and Geronimo are not like the God of the white-eyed
men&mdash;they cannot be here, there, and everywhere at the same
time."</p>

<p>Wichita Billings smiled. "But perhaps He guides them to the
right place at the right time," she suggested. "Are you not here
now, Shoz-Dijiji, instead of a Cho-kon-en or a Ned-ni?"</p>

<p>"You have strong medicine, white girl; but so did the great
izze-nantan, Nakay-do-klunni. He made strong medicine that turned
away the bullets of the white-eyed soldiers, but at Cibicu Creek
they killed him. The best medicine is to stay out of danger."</p>

<p>"Well, to tell you the truth, Shoz-Dijiji," admitted the girl,
"I did not dream that there was a renegade within a hundred miles
of here."</p>

<p>"When the Shis-Inday are on the war trail they are like your
God&mdash;they are here, there, and everywhere."</p>

<p>"Are there others with you, Shoz-Dijiji?"</p>

<p>"No, I am alone."</p>

<p>"What are you doing here? Were you&mdash;were you coming to the
ranch, Shoz-Dijiji?" she asked, hesitatingly. "Were you coming to
see me?" There was potential gladness in her voice.</p>

<p>"Shoz-Dijiji has been scouting," replied the Apache. "He is
returning to the camp of Geronimo."</p>

<p>"But you were going to stop and see me, Shoz-Dijiji," she
insisted.</p>

<p>"No. It would have made trouble. Your father does not like
Shoz-Dijiji, and he would like to kill a renegade. Shoz-Dijiji does
not wish to be killed. Therefore there would be trouble."</p>

<p>"My father is sorry for the things he said to you, Shoz-Dijiji.
Come to the ranch, and he will tell you so. He was angry, because
he was very fond of Mason; and you know that they had just found
Mason murdered&mdash;and scalped."</p>

<p>"Shoz-Dijiji knows. He knows more about that than your father.
Shoz-Dijiji knows that it was not an Apache that killed Mason."</p>

<p>"How do you know? Do you know who did kill him? He was
scalped."</p>

<p>"Are the white-eyed men such fools that they think that only an
Apache can scalp? If they were not such fools they would know that
it is only occasionally that Apaches do take the scalps of their
enemies. They do know this, but they do not want to admit it. They
know that whenever a white-eyed man wishes to kill an enemy he need
only scalp him to convince everyone that Apaches did it, because
everyone wishes to believe that every murder is done by
Apaches.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know who killed Mason and why. He was robbed in
Cheetim's Hog Ranch, and he had sworn to get Cheetim. He was
looking for him with a gun. Cheetim hired a man to ride out with
Mason and shoot him in the back. That is all.</p>

<p>"Now come. Shoz-Dijiji ride back with you until you are near the
ranch. You must not ride alone again even if you are not afraid of
the Apaches, for there are bad men among the white-eyes&mdash;men
who would harm you even more surely than an Apache."</p>

<p>He motioned her to precede him up the steep canyon side; and
when the two ponies had scrambled to the summit he rode at her
side, where the ground permitted, as they walked their ponies in
the direction of the Billings ranch.</p>

<p>For a while they rode in silence, the Apache constantly on the
alert against another and more dangerous surprise, the girl
thoughtful, her face reflecting the cast of sadness in which her
thoughts were molded.</p>

<p>Wichita Billings knew that the man at her side loved her. She
knew that she was drawn to him more than to any other man that she
had ever known, but she did not know that this attraction
constituted love. Raised as she had been in an atmosphere of racial
hatred, schooled in ignorance and bigotry by people who looked upon
every race and nation, other than their own race and nation, as
inferior, she could scarce believe it possible that she could give
her love to an Indian; and so her mind argued against her heart
that it was not love that she felt for him but some other emotion
which should be suppressed.</p>

<p>Shoz-Dijiji, on his part, realized the barrier that prejudice
had erected between them and the difficulty that the white girl
might have to surmount it in the event that she loved him. He, too,
had faced a similar barrier in his hatred of the white race, but
that his love had long since leveled. A greater obstacle, one which
he could not again face, was the hurt that his pride had suffered
when she had recoiled from his embrace.</p>

<p>Thoughts such as these kept them silent for some time until
Wichita chanced to recall Nejeunee.</p>

<p>"Shoz-Dijiji," she exclaimed, "where is your pinto war
pony?"</p>

<p>The Apache shrugged. "Who knows?"</p>

<p>"What became of him? Is he dead, or did you lose him in
battle?"</p>

<p>"We were starving," said the Apache. "We had eaten all the
ponies except Nejeunee. It was in Sonora. Your soldiers were
pressing us on one side, the Mexicans upon the other. At night I
led Nejeunee close to the picket line of the white-eyed soldiers. I
have not seen him since."</p>

<p>"You were very fond of Nejeunee, Shoz-Dijiji."</p>

<p>"In Apache Nejeunee means friend," said the man. "One by one all
of my friends are being taken from me. Nejeunee was just one more.
Usen has forgotten Shoz-Dijiji."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not," replied Wichita. "What would you say if I told
you that Nejeunee is alive and that I know where he is?"</p>

<p>"I should say that after all Usen has at last been good to me in
giving me you as a friend. Tell me where he is."</p>

<p>"He's on our ranch&mdash;in the back pasture."</p>

<p>"On your ranch? How did Nejeunee get there?"</p>

<p>"You left him near the picket line of Lieutenant King's troop,
and when they got back across the border he sent him up to me."</p>

<p>"King did not tell me."</p>

<p>"You have seen the lieutenant?"</p>

<p>"We met in Chihuahua," said Shoz-Dijiji.</p>

<p>"And you talked with him?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"But you were on the war path, and he was after you. How could
you have met and talked?"</p>

<p>"King and Shoz-Dijiji went into the cattle business
together."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" demanded Wichita.</p>

<p>"When you see King ask him. He will tell you."</p>

<p>"Were you two alone together?"</p>

<p>"Yes, for a day and a night."</p>

<p>"And you did not kill him?"</p>

<p>"No. Shoz-Dijiji does not kill anyone that you love."</p>

<p>"Oh, Shoz-Dijiji," exclaimed the girl, "I can't tell you how
much I appreciate that; but really you are mistaken in thinking
that I love Lieutenant King."</p>

<p>"All right, next time I kill him."</p>

<p>"No, oh, no, you mustn't do that."</p>

<p>"Why not? He is on the war trail against me. He kill me all
right, if he get the chance. If you no love him, I kill him."</p>

<p>"But he is my friend, my very good friend," insisted the girl.
"He is your friend, too, Shoz-Dijiji. If I ask you not to kill him
will you promise me that you won't?"</p>

<p>"Shoz-Dijiji promise you he no try to kill King. Mebbe so, in
battle, Shoz-Dijiji have to kill him. That he cannot help."</p>

<p>"Oh, Shoz-Dijiji, why don't you come in and stop fighting us? It
is so useless. You can never win; and you are such a good man,
Shoz-Dijiji, that it seems a shame that you should sacrifice your
life uselessly."</p>

<p>"No, we can never win. We know that, but what else is there for
us? The white-eyed men make war upon us even in peace. They treat
us like enemies and prisoners. We are men, the same as they. Why do
they not treat us like men? They say that we are bad men and that
we torture our prisoners and that that is bad. Do they not torture
us? We torture the bodies of our enemies, but the white men torture
our hearts. Perhaps all the feelings of the white-eyed men are in
their bodies, but that is not so with the Shis-Inday. Bad words and
bad looks make wounds in our hearts that hurt us more than a knife
thrust in the body. The body wounds may heal but the heart wounds
never&mdash;they go on hurting forever. No, I shall not come in. I
am a war chief among the Be-don-ko-he. Shall I come in to be a
'dirty Siwash' among the white-eyes?"</p>

<p>For a while the girl was silent after the Apache had ceased
speaking. Their patient ponies stepped daintily along the rough
trail. The descending sun cast their shadows, grotesquely, far
ahead. The stifling heat of midday was gradually giving place to
the promise of the coming cool of evening.</p>

<p>"We are almost home," said the girl, presently. "I wish you
would come and talk with my father. He is not a bad man. Perhaps he
can find some way to help you."</p>

<p>"No," said Shoz-Dijiji. "His people and my people are at war.
His heart is not friendly toward Apaches. It is better that I do
not come."</p>

<p>"But you want to get Nejeunee," insisted the girl.</p>

<p>"You have told me where Nejeunee is. I will get him."</p>

<p>She did not insist, and again they rode in silence until the
warrior reined in his pony just below the summit of a low hill.
Beyond the hill, but hidden from their sight, stood the Billings
ranch house.</p>

<p>"Good-bye," said Shoz-Dijiji. "I think perhaps we never see each
other again. When the soldiers come back from Mexico we go back
there and do not come to this country any more."</p>

<p>"Oh, Shoz-Dijiji," cried the girl, "I do not want you to
go."</p>

<p>"Shoz-Dijiji does not want to go," he replied. "Your people have
driven Shoz-Dijiji from his own country."</p>

<p>"I should think that you would hate me, Shoz-Dijiji."</p>

<p>"No, I do not hate you. I love you," he said simply.</p>

<p>"You must not say that, Shoz-Dijiji," she answered, sadly.</p>

<p>"If Shoz-Dijiji was a white-eyed man, you would listen," he
said.</p>

<p>She was silent.</p>

<p>"Tell me," he demanded, "is that not true?"</p>

<p>"Oh, God! I don't know, I don't know," she cried.</p>

<p>"Shoz-Dijiji knows," said the Be-don-ko-he. "Good-bye!"</p>

<p>He wheeled his pony and rode away.</p>

<p>The sun was setting as Wichita Billings dismounted wearily at
the corral back of the ranch house. Luke Jensen came from the bunk
house to take her pony.</p>

<p>"Where's Dad?" she asked.</p>

<p>"One of the boys found a beef killed this mornin'. He said it
looked like Injuns hed done it. Yore Dad rid over to hev a look at
it. He ought to be back right smart soon now." Luke glanced over
across the back pasture toward the east.</p>

<p>Wichita knitted her brows. "Did he go that way?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Yep," assented Luke.</p>

<p>"Get one of the other boys to go with you, and ride out and meet
him. If Apaches killed the beef there may be some of them around."
Wichita turned toward the ranch house, hesitated, and then walked
back to Luke.</p>

<p>"Luke," she said, "you don't hate all Indians do you?"</p>

<p>"You know I don't, Miss. I'd a bin dead now ef it hedn't a-bin
fer one of 'em. Why?"</p>

<p>"Well, if you ever meet an Apache, Luke! remember that, and
don't shoot until you're plumb sure he's hostile."</p>

<p>Jensen scratched his head. "Yes, Miss," he said, "but what's the
idee?"</p>

<p>"There may be friendly Indians around, and if you should shoot
one of them," she explained, "the rest might turn hostile."</p>

<p>As Wichita walked toward the house Luke stood looking after
her.</p>

<p>"I don't reckon she's gone loco," he soliloquized, "but she
shore better watch herself."</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>It was ten o'clock before Luke Jensen returned to the ranch. He
went immediately to the house and knocked on the door, entering at
Wichita's invitation.</p>

<p>"Your Dad back?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"No. Didn't you see anything of him?"</p>

<p>"Nary hide nor hair."</p>

<p>"Where do you suppose he can be?"</p>

<p>"I dunno. They's Indians around, though. I bumped plumb into one
tother side of the willows in the draw outside the fer pasture
gate, an' who do you reckon it was? Why none other than that
Shoz-Dijiji fellow what give me a lift that time. He must-a thought
some o' the hosses in the pasture were comin' through them willows,
fer he never tried to hide hisself at all. I jest rid plumb on top
o' him. He knew me, too. I couldn't help but think o' wot you told
me just before I left about bein' sure not to shoot up any
friendly. Say, did you know he was around?"</p>

<p>"How could I know that?" demanded Wichita.</p>

<p>"I dunno," admitted Luke, scratching his head; "but it did seem
dern funny to me."</p>

<p>"It's funny the man with you didn't take a shot at him,"
commented Wichita. "Most all of the boys believe in shooting an
Apache first and inquiring about his past later."</p>

<p>"There wasn't no one with me," explained Luke. "There wasn't no
one around but me when I left, and I didn't want to waste time
waiting fer someone to show up. Anyways, I kin see alone jest as
fer as I kin with help."</p>

<p>"Well, I reckon he'll be coming along pretty soon, Luke," said
Wichita. "Good night."</p>

<p>"Good night, Miss," replied Jensen.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="chap13" id="chap13">XIII. &mdash; BACK TO SONORA</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">DAWN broke and Wichita Billings still sat fully
dressed waiting for her father. It was the first time that she had
ever worried greatly over his absence, and she could not explain
why she worried now. She had always thought of her father as
absolutely able to take care of himself in any emergency. He was a
masterful man, utterly fearless, and yet not prone to take
unnecessary chances.</p>

<p>A dozen times she had been upon the point of going to the bunk
house and sending the entire outfit out to search for him, but each
time she had shrunk from the ridicule that she well knew would be
slyly heaped upon both her father and herself if she did so without
good warrant; but now with a new day come and no word from him, she
determined to swallow her pride and carry out her plan, however
foolish it might appear.</p>

<p>Persistent knocking on the bunk house door finally elicited a
profane request for information as to what was "eating" her.</p>

<p>"Dad's not back yet," she shouted.</p>

<p>"Oh, hell, is that you Miss? I didn't know it was you."</p>

<p>"Never mind. Roll out and get busy. We're goin' to find him if
we have to ride to Boston," she cried.</p>

<p>Luke Jensen, being the youngest man in the outfit, both in years
and point of service; was first from the bunk house, it being his
duty to bring the saddle horses in from pasture. At the barn, he
found that Wichita had already bridled the horse that was kept up
for the purpose of bringing the others in and was on the point of
swinging the heavy saddle to its back.</p>

<p>He greeted her cheerily, took the saddle from her, and completed
its adjustment.</p>

<p>"You worried about your Paw, Miss?" he asked as he drew the
latigo through the cinch ring.</p>

<p>"Something might have happened to him," she replied. "It won't
hurt to look for him."</p>

<p>"No, it won't do no hurt, though I reckon he kin take keer o'
hisself about as good as the next man. I wouldn't worry none,
Miss," he concluded, reassuringly, as he stepped into the stirrup
and swung his leg over the horse's rump.</p>

<p>Wichita stood by the corral gate watching Luke riding down into
the east pasture at an easy lope. She saw him disappear among the
willows that grow along the draw a mile from the corrals and two
thirds of the way across the pasture; and then "Smooth" Kreff, her
father's foreman joined her.</p>

<p>"Mornin', Miss," he greeted her. He looked at her sharply.
"You-all been up all night, aint you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she admitted.</p>

<p>"Pshaw! Why didn't you rout us out? We'd a-gone lookin' fer him
any time."</p>

<p>"There wouldn't have been much use looking for him at
night."</p>

<p>"No, and there aint much use lookin' fer him now; but it would
a-made you-all feel easier," replied the man.</p>

<p>"Why isn't there any now?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"Because the Boss kin take keer of himself. He aint a-goin' to
thank us none, I'm figgerin'."</p>

<p>"No, if he's all right, he won't; but if he isn't all right
we'll be glad we did."</p>

<p>"Them hosses must a-gone plumb to the fer end of the pasture,"
remarked Kreff.</p>

<p>"They always do, if we're in a particular hurry to get them up,"
said Wichita.</p>

<p>The other men had come from the bunk house by now and were
standing around waiting.</p>

<p>"Thet dog-gone 'cavvy' must a-knowed we wanted 'em bad," said
one.</p>

<p>"Like as not they seed Luke comin' an' hid out in the willows,"
suggested another.</p>

<p>"They shore are an ornery bunch," admitted a third.</p>

<p>"I could of ridden down there backwards on a bicycle an' rounded
'em up before this," boasted a fourth.</p>

<p>"Here they come now," exclaimed Wichita, as several horses broke
from the willows and trotted toward the corrals.</p>

<p>In twos and threes they emerged from the dense foliage until
some forty or fifty horses were strung out on the trail to the
corrals, and then Luke Jensen rode into sight from out the
willows.</p>

<p>"What's thet critter he's leadin'?" demanded one of the men.</p>

<p>"It's saddled," volunteered another.</p>

<p>"It's Scar Foot," said Kreff.</p>

<p>After that there was silence. Some of the men glanced at
Wichita; but most of them stood looking away, embarrassed. Scar
Foot was Billings' favorite horse&mdash;the animal he had ridden
out on the previous day.</p>

<p>The men walked out of the corral into the pasture to head the
horses through the bars that had been let down to receive them. No
one said anything. Kreff walked forward toward Luke; and the latter
reined in and, leaning down, spoke to the foreman in a low voice.
Wichita approached them.</p>

<p>"Where did you find Scar Foot?" she asked. "Where is Dad?"</p>

<p>"Scar Foot was jest outside the east gate, Miss," explained
Jensen. "The other hosses was all up there by him, jest inside the
fence."</p>

<p>"Did you see anything of Dad?" she demanded again.</p>

<p>"We-all's goin' to ride right out an' look fer him, Miss," said
Kreff.</p>

<p>Inside the corral two men were roping, and the others were busy
saddling their horses as they were caught.</p>

<p>Wichita climbed to the top of the corral. "I'll ride Two Spot,"
she called to one of the ropers.</p>

<p>Finally all the horses they needed had been caught and the
others turned back into the pasture. One of the men who had been
among the first to saddle was saddling Two Spot for Wichita. Luke
Jensen, who had transferred his outfit to one of his own string,
kept as far from Wichita as he could; but as she was about to
mount, Kreff approached her, leading his own horse. "I wouldn't
come along, Miss, ef I was you," he advised. "We may have some hard
ridin'."</p>

<p>"When did I get so I couldn't ride with any of you?" she asked,
quietly.</p>

<p>"There may be some fightin'," he insisted, "an' I wouldn't want
you-all to get hurted."</p>

<p>The girl smiled, ever so slightly. "It's good of you, 'Smooth,'"
she said; "but I understand, I think." She swung into the saddle,
and Kreff said no more.</p>

<p>Luke Jensen leading, they rode at a run down through the
pasture, scattering the "cavvy," and into the dense willows,
emerging upon the opposite side, climbing the steep bank of the
draw, and away again at top speed toward the east gate. In silence
they rode, with grim faces.</p>

<p>There, just beyond the fence; they found Billings&mdash;where
Luke Jensen had found him. Wichita knelt beside her father and felt
of his hands and face. She did not cry. Dry eyed she arose and for
the first time saw that one of the men who had brought up the rear
had led Scar Foot back with them; but even had she known when they
started she would not have been surprised, for almost from the
moment that she had seen Luke Jensen leading the horse back toward
the corrals and had seen him whisper to Kreff she had expected to
find just what she had found.</p>

<p>Tenderly the rough men lifted all that was mortal of Jefferson
Billings across the saddle in which he had ridden to his death, and
many were the muttered curses that would have been vented
vehemently and aloud had it not been for the presence of the girl,
for Billings had been shot in the back and&mdash;scalped. On
walking horses the cortege filed slowly toward the ranch house, the
men deferentially falling behind the led horse that bore the body
of the "Boss" directly in rear of the girl who could not cry.</p>

<p>"He never had a chanct," growled one of the men. "Plugged right
in the back between the shoulders!"</p>

<p>"God damned dirty Siwashes!" muttered another.</p>

<p>"I seen an Injun here yestiddy evenin'," said Luke.</p>

<p>"Why the Hell didn't you say so before?" demanded Kreff.</p>

<p>"I told Miss Chita," replied the young man; "but, Lor', it warnt
him did it."</p>

<p>"Wot makes you-all think it warnt?" asked Kreff.</p>

<p>"He's a friend of hern. He wouldn't have hurted her old
man."</p>

<p>"What Injun was it?"</p>

<p>"Thet Shoz-Dijiji fellow what saved me thet time I was hurted
an' lost. I know he wouldn't hev done it. They must hev been some
others around, too."</p>

<p>Kreff snorted. "Fer a bloke wot's supposed to hail from Texas
you-all shore are simple about Injuns. Thet Siwash is a Cheeracow
Apache an' a Cheeracow Apache'd kill his grandmother fer a lead
nickel."</p>

<p>"I don't believe thet Injun would. Why didn't he plug me when he
had the chancet?" demanded Jensen.</p>

<p>"Say!" exclaimed Kreff. "Thet there pinto stallion thet thet
there greaser brung up from Chihuahua fer King warnt with the
'cavvy' this mornin'. By gum! There's the answer. Thet there pony
belonged to Shoz-Dijiji. He was a-gettin' it when the Boss rid
up."</p>

<p>"They had words last time the Siwash was around here,"
volunteered another.</p>

<p>"Sure! The Boss said he'd plug him if he ever seen him hangin'
around here again," recalled one of the men.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>At the ranch house they laid Jefferson Billings on his bed and
covered him with a sheet, and then "Smooth" Kreff went to Wichita
and told her of his deductions and the premises upon which they
were based.</p>

<p>"I don't believe it," said the girl. "Shoz-Dijiji has always
been friendly to us. I ran across him by accident in the hills
yesterday, and he rode home with me because, he said, there were
other renegades around and it might not be safe for me to ride
alone. It must have been some other Indian who did it."</p>

<p>"But his cayuse is gone," insisted Kreff.</p>

<p>"He may have taken his pony;" admitted the girl. "I don't say
that he didn't do that. It was his; and he had a right to take it,
but I don't believe that he killed Dad."</p>

<p>"Your Paw didn't have no use fer Injuns," Kreff reminded her.
"He might have taken a shot at this Siwash."</p>

<p>"No; his guns were both in their holsters, and his rifle was in
its boot. He never saw the man that shot him."</p>

<p>Kreff scratched his head. "I reckon thet's right," he admitted.
"It shore was a dirty trick. Thet's what makes me know it was a
Siwash."</p>

<p>The girl turned away sadly.</p>

<p>"Don't you worry none, Miss," said Kreff; "I'll look after
things fer you, jes' like your Paw was here."</p>

<p>"Thanks, 'Smooth,'" replied Wichita. "You boys have been
wonderful."</p>

<p>After the man had left the room the girl sat staring fixedly at
the opposite wall. A calendar hung there and a colored print in a
cheap frame, but these she did not see. What she saw was the tall,
straight figure of a bronzed man, an almost naked savage. He sat
upon his war pony and looked into her eyes. "Shoz-Dijiji does not
kill anyone that you love," he said to her.</p>

<p>The girl dropped her face into her hands, stifling a dry sob.
"Oh, Shoz-Dijiji. How could you?" she cried.</p>

<p>Suddenly she sprang to her feet. Her lips were set in a
straight, hard line; her eyes flashed in anger.</p>

<p>"Oh, God!" she cried. "You gave me love, and I threw it away
upon an Indian, upon an enemy of my people; and now in your anger,
you have punished me. I was blind, but you have made me see again.
Forgive me, God, and you will see that I have learned my lesson
well."</p>

<p>Stepping through the doorway onto the porch, Wichita seized a
short piece of iron pipe and struck a triangle of iron that hung
suspended from a roof joist. Three times she struck it, and in
answer to the signal the men came from bunk house and corrals until
all that had been within hearing of the summons were gathered
before her.</p>

<p>Dry eyed, she faced them; and upon her countenance was an
expression that none ever had seen there before. It awed them into
silence as they waited for her to speak. They were rough, uncouth
men, little able to put their inmost thoughts into words, and none
of them ever had looked upon an avenging angel; otherwise they
would have found a fitting description for the daughter of their
dead Boss as she faced them now.</p>

<p>"I have something to say to you," she commenced in a level
voice. "My father lies in here, murdered. He was shot in the back.
He never had a chance. As far as we know no one saw him killed, but
I guess we all know who did it. There doesn't seem to be any chance
for a doubt&mdash;it was the Be-don-ko-he war chief, Shoz-Dijiji,
Black Bear.</p>

<p>"If it takes all the rest of my life and every acre and every
critter that I own, I'm going to get the man that killed my father;
and I'm starting now by offering a thousand dollars to the man who
brings in Shoz-Dijiji&mdash;dead!"</p>

<p>When she had ceased speaking she turned and walked back into the
house, closing the door after her.</p>

<p>The men, moving slowly toward the bunk house, talked together in
low tones, discussing the girl's offer.</p>

<p>Inside the house, Wichita Billings threw herself face down upon
a sofa and burst into tears.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>Shoz-Dijiji slid from the back of the pinto war pony, Nejeunee,
in the camp of Geronimo and stood before the great war-chief of the
Apaches.</p>

<p>"Seven times, my son," said the old chief, "have I cast
hoddentin to the four winds at evening since you rode away; seven
times have I cast hoddentin to the four winds at dawn; twice seven
times have I prayed to the spirits whose especial duty it is to
watch over you to bring you back in safety. My prayers have been
answered. What word do you bring?"</p>

<p>"Shoz-Dijiji went to the reservation at San Carlos," replied the
young man. "None of our friends or relatives who went out upon the
war trail with us is there. I heard many stories, but I do not
speak of anything that I did not see with my own eyes or hear with
my own ears.</p>

<p>"There are many soldiers scouting everywhere. There are so many
that I think all the soldiers that were sent to Mexico after us
must have been called back to hunt for us here.</p>

<p>"The reservation Indians say that now that Miles is after us we
shall all be killed. They advise us to lay down our arms and
surrender. I think that very soon the soldiers will find our camp
here."</p>

<p>"You are a war chief, my son," said Geronimo. "Already you are
very wise. At the councils even the old men listen to you with
respect. What would you advise?"</p>

<p>"We are very few," replied Shoz-Dijiji, thoughtfully. "We cannot
take the war trail successfully against the pindah-lickoyee in this
country where we are. Sooner or later they will kill us or capture
us. This is no longer a good country for the Apache. It is our
country that Usen made for us, but we cannot be happy in it any
longer because of the pindah-lickoyee. Shoz-Dijiji does not wish to
live here any more. Let us go to Mexico. Perhaps the soldiers of
the pindah-lickoyee will not again follow us into Mexico. There we
may live as we would wish to live and not as the pindah-lickoyee
want us to live."</p>

<p>"And we can punish the Mexicans for inviting the soldiers of the
pindah-lickoyee to come down to their country and kill us," added
Geronimo. "I think you have spoken true words. I think we should go
to Mexico. Perhaps there we shall find all of our friends and
relatives from whom we became separated when the soldiers were
hunting us in Sonora and Chihuahua. Perhaps we can even be happy
again. Who knows?"</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>And so it was that when the troopers of "B" Troop rode into the
camp of Geronimo a week later they found nothing but cold ashes
where the cooking fires had been and the debris of a deserted
Indian village that the Apaches had not taken their usual
precautions to hide, since they expected never again to return to
their beloved mountains.</p>

<p><br>
Far to the south, below the line, frightened peons burned many
candles and said many prayers, for they had heard stories. A man
had found the bodies of three vaqueros, and he had seen the print
of an Apache moccasin in the camp where they had been killed. They
had not been tortured nor mutilated.</p>

<p>"The Apache Devil again!" whispered the peons.</p>

<p>A terrified freighter, a bullet through his shoulder, galloped
an exhausted mule into a little hamlet. The wagon train that he had
been with had been attacked by Apaches and all had been slain save
he, and with his own eyes he had recognized Geronimo.</p>

<p>"Holy Mother, preserve us! the Apache Devil, both!"</p>

<p>Leaving a trail of blood and ashes behind them the renegades
headed for the mountains near Casa Grande. Having committed no
depredations north of the line they felt confident that the United
States soldiers would not follow them into Sonora. Why should they?
There was nothing for the soldiers of the pindah-lickoyee to
avenge.</p>

<p>Thus the Apaches reasoned, since, in common with white men, they
possessed the very human trait of easily forgetting the wrongs that
they committed against others, even though they might always harbor
those that were committed against them. So now they either forgot
or ignored what the whites still considered just causes for
righteous anger&mdash;burnt ranches, stolen stock, tortured men,
women, and children, mutilated corpses that had emblazoned their
trail through Arizona from San Carlos to the border over a year
before, but the whites had no intention of permitting these
occurrences to go brown in their memories.</p>

<p>From one end of the country to the other Geronimo and his bloody
deeds occupied more front page newspaper space than any other
topic, and to the readers of the newspapers of all the civilized
world his name was a household word. For over a year the armies of
two nations had been futilely engaged in an attempt to capture or
kill a handful of men, women, and children. Geronimo and his
renegades had outwitted, outgeneraled, and outfought them, and now,
after again outwitting the army of the United States, they had come
back to Mexico and were meting out punishment to those, whom they
mistakenly believed were responsible for bringing United States
troops below the border to fight them, and in carrying out this
policy, they attacked every Mexican they saw after they crossed the
border, all the way to Casa Grande. Nor did they desist then.</p>

<p>South of Casa Grande, near a place which the Apaches called
Gosoda, a road wound out of the town through a mountain pass. Many
were the freight trains that lumbered through the dust along this
road; and near here hid Geronimo, the Apache Devil, and their
followers.</p>

<p>Here the renegades remained for some time, killing freighters,
taking what supplies they desired, and destroying the remainder;
but the reputation that this road achieved was such as to
discourage freighting for the nonce, though it attracted Mexican
soldiers in embarrassing numbers. Geronimo then led his followers
into the Sierra de Antunez Mountains where they found all that now
remained of their depleted tribe and learned that the United States
soldiers had not left the mountains of Mexico but, on the contrary,
were becoming more active than ever.</p>

<p>Geronimo was disheartened when he learned of this, for he had
banked wholly on the belief that he would be rid of the menace of
United States troops if he returned to Mexico without committing
more depredations in the United States.</p>

<p>"What are we to do?" he demanded at the council fire. "Every
man's hand is against us. If we return to the reservation we shall
be put in prison and killed; if we stay in Mexico they will
continue to send more and more soldiers to fight us."</p>

<p>"There is but one thing to do," replied Shoz-Dijiji when
Geronimo had finished. "We must continue fighting until we are all
killed. Already we are reckless of our lives, let us be more so,
let us give no quarter to anyone and ask no favors. It is better to
die on the war trail than to be put in prison and choked to death
with a rope about the neck. I, Shoz-Dijiji, shall continue to fight
the enemies of my people until I am killed. I have spoken."</p>

<p>"You are a young man," said Geronimo. "Your words are the words
of a young man. When I was young I wanted nothing better than to
fight, but now that I am getting old I should like a little peace
and quiet, although I should not object to fighting to obtain them
if I thought that I might win them thus.</p>

<p>"But now," he continued, sadly, "I cannot see any hope of
winning anything but death by fighting longer against the
pindah-lickoyee. There are too many of them, and they will not let
us rest. I would make a peace treaty with them, if I could."</p>

<p>"They do not want to make a peace treaty with us," said
Shoz-Dijiji. "They want only to kill us all that there may be no
more Apaches left to dispute the ownership of the land they have
stolen from us. Let the old men and the women and the children make
a peace treaty with the pindah-lickoyee. Shoz-Dijiji will never
make peace if it means that he must return to San Carlos and be a
reservation Indian."</p>

<p>"I think that we should make peace with them," said Na-chi-ta,
"if they will promise that we shall not be killed."</p>

<p>"The promises of the pindah-lickoyee are valueless," growled a
warrior.</p>

<p>Thus they spoke around their council fires at night, and though
most of them wanted peace and none of them saw any other
alternative than death, they clung doggedly to the war trail.
During three months they had many skirmishes with the white
soldiers; and five times their camps were surprised, yet in no
instance were the troops of the pindah-lickoyee able either to
capture or defeat them; never was there a decisive victory for the
trained soldiers who so greatly outnumbered them.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>In July 1886 Geronimo's force numbered some twenty-five fighting
men, a few women, and a couple of boys. Outside of their weapons
and the clothing that they wore they possessed a few hundred pounds
of dried meat and nineteen ponies&mdash;the sole physical resources
at their command to wage a campaign against a great nation that
already had expended a million dollars during the preceding
fourteen months in futile efforts to subjugate them and had
enlisted as allies the armed forces of another civilized power.</p>

<p><br>
Moving farther and farther into Old Mexico as the troops pressed
them, the renegades were camped on the Yongi River, nearly three
hundred miles south of the boundary, late in July. They believed
that they had temporarily thrown their pursuers off the track and,
war weary, were taking advantage of the brief respite they had
earned to rest. Peace and quiet lay upon the camp beside the Yongi.
The braves squatted, smoking, or lay stretched in sleep. The squaws
patched war worn moccasins. There was little conversation and no
laughter. The remnant of a once powerful nation was making its last
stand, bravely, without even the sustaining influence of hope.</p>

<p>A rifle cracked. War whoops burst upon their ears. Leaping to
their feet, seizing the weapons that lay always ready at hand, the
renegades fell back as the soldiers and scouts of Lawton's command
charged their camp. The surprise had been complete, and in their
swift retreat the Apaches lost three killed; whom they carried off
with them, as they abandoned their supply of dried meat and their
nineteen ponies to the enemy. Now they had nothing left but their
weapons and their indomitable courage.</p>

<p>Clambering to inaccessible places among the rocks, where mounted
men could not follow, they waited until the soldiers withdrew.
Shoz-Dijiji arose and started down toward the camp.</p>

<p>"Where are you going?" demanded Geronimo.</p>

<p>"The white-eyes have taken Nejeunee," replied the war chief.
"Shoz-Dijiji goes to take his war pony from them."</p>

<p>"Good!" exclaimed Geronimo. "I go with you." He turned and
looked inquiringly at the other warriors before he followed
Shoz-Dijiji down the steep declivity. After the two came the
balance of the grim warriors.</p>

<p>Keeping to the hills, unseen, they followed Lawton's command in
the rear of which they saw their ponies being driven. As the hours
passed, Geronimo saw that the distance between the main body of
troopers and the pony herd was increasing.</p>

<p>A few miles ahead was a small meadow just beyond which the trail
made a sharp turn around the shoulder of a hill. Geronimo whispered
to Shoz-Dijiji who nodded understanding and assent. The word was
passed among the other warriors; and at the same time Shoz-Dijiji
turned to the left to make a detour through the hills, while a
single warrior remained upon the trail of the troops.</p>

<p>At a smart trot the Be-don-ko-he war chief led his fellows
through the rough mountains. For an hour they pushed rapidly on
until Shoz-Dijiji dropped to his belly near the summit of a low
hill and commenced to worm his way slowly upward. Behind him came
twenty painted savages. In the rear of concealing shrubbery at the
hill top the Apache Devil stopped, and behind him stopped the
twenty.</p>

<p>Below Shoz-Dijiji was a little meadow. It lay very quiet and
peaceful in the afternoon sun, deserted; but Shoz-Dijiji knew that
it would not be deserted long. Already he could hear the approach
of armed men. Presently they came into sight. Captain Lawton rode
in advance. At his side was Lieutenant Gatewood. Behind them were
the scouts and the soldiers. The formation was careless, because
they all knew that the renegades, surprised and defeated, were far
behind them.</p>

<p>Shoz-Dijiji watched them pass. In the rear of the column he saw
Lieutenant King who had been temporarily detached from his own
troop to serve with this emergency command of Lawton's. The length
of the meadow they rode. The head of the column disappeared where
the trail turned the shoulder of a hill, and still Shoz-Dijiji and
the twenty lay quietly waiting.</p>

<p>Now half the column was out of sight. Presently Shoz-Dijiji
watched King disappear from view, and once again the little meadow
was deserted, but not for long.</p>

<p>A little pinto stallion trotted into view, stopped, pricked
dainty ears and looked about. Behind him came other
ponies&mdash;nineteen of them&mdash;and behind the ponies three sun
parched troopers in dusty, faded blue.</p>

<p>Silently Shoz-Dijiji arose, and behind him arose twenty other
painted warriors. They uttered no war whoops as they raced silently
down into the meadow in front of the ponies. There would be noise
enough in a moment; but they wished to delay the inevitable as long
as possible lest the main body of the command, warned by the sounds
of combat, should return to the meadow before the mission of the
Apaches was completed.</p>

<p>The first trooper to see them vented his surprise in lurid
profanity and spurred forward in an attempt to stampede the ponies
across the meadow before the renegades could turn them. His
companions joined him in the effort.</p>

<p>Shoz-Dijiji and six other warriors raced swiftly to intercept
the ponies, while the other renegades moved down to the turn in the
trail where they could hold up the troop should it return too
soon.</p>

<p>The Apache Devil whistled sharply as he ran and the pinto
stallion stopped, wheeled, and ran toward him. Three ponies,
frightened by the shouts of the soldiers, raced swiftly ahead,
passing Shoz-Dijiji and his six, passing the balance of the twenty
who had not yet reached their position, and disappeared around the
turn.</p>

<p>Shoz-Dijiji leaped to Nejeunee's back and headed the remaining
ponies in a circle, back in the direction from which they had come
and toward the six who had accompanied him.</p>

<p>It was then that one of the three soldiers opened fire, but the
Apaches did not reply. They were too busy catching mounts from the
frightened herd, and they had not come primarily to fight. When
they had recaptured their ponies there would be time enough for
that, perhaps, but it was certain that there was no time for it
now. They had their hands full for a few seconds, but eventually
seven warriors were mounted; and Geronimo and the remainder of the
renegades were coming down the meadow at a run as Shoz-Dijiji and
his six drove the herd along the back trail. Hopelessly
outnumbered, cut off from their fellows, the three troopers looked
for some avenue of escape and fell back in front of the herd,
firing. It was then that the Apaches opened fire; and at the first
volley one of the soldiers fell; and the other two turned and raced
for safety, rounding the side of the herd, they spurred their
mounts along the flank of the renegades. A few hasty shots were
sent after them; but the Apaches wasted no time upon them, and they
won through in safety while Shoz-Dijiji and the six urged the
ponies at a run along the back trail toward camp, as those on foot
took to the hills and disappeared just as Lawton's command came
charging to the rescue, too late.</p>

<p>Lawton followed the Apaches; but, being fearful of ambush, he
moved cautiously, and long before he could overtake them the
renegades had made good their escape.</p>

<h2><a name="chap14" id="chap14">XIV. &mdash; SKELETON CANYON</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">THE weeks dragged on&mdash;lean and hungry weeks
of slinking through the mountains with an implacable enemy always
on their heels. The renegades had little food and little rest.
Their cause seemed hopeless even to the most war-like and the most
sanguine of their number. Only Shoz-Dijiji held out for war. That
was because he had nothing to live for. He courted death, but no
bullet found him.</p>

<p>At last the others determined to give up; and Geronimo sent a
messenger to the commander of a body of Mexican troops that was
camped near them, asking for a parley.</p>

<p>All that the Mexicans asked was that Geronimo should take his
band out of Mexico; and this the old chieftain promised to do, both
sides agreeing not to fight any more against the other.</p>

<p>Moving northward toward the border, Geronimo made no effort to
elude the American troops, as he was really anxious to arrange for
a parley with them; but by chance they did not come into contact
with any, and at last the renegades went into camp near the big
bend of the Bivaspe River in Sonora.</p>

<p>"How can you remain here?" demanded Shoz-Dijiji. "You have
promised the Mexicans that you will leave their country, and you
cannot go into Arizona or New Mexico because the soldiers of the
pindah-lickoyee will not let you. Where are you going? You should
not have promised the Mexicans that you would leave. Now they will
attack you, when they find that you have not left, for they know
that you have had time enough to get out of Mexico."</p>

<p>"We cannot remain here," replied Geronimo, "and we cannot go
elsewhere&mdash;as long as we are at war with the pindah-lickoyee.
We are too few to fight them. There remains nothing but to make the
best peace with them that we can."</p>

<p>"It is right that you should do so," said Shoz-Dijiji, "for that
is to the best interests of the Be-don-ko-he for the welfare of the
tribe; but for Shoz-Dijiji there can be no peace. I shall not go
back to the reservation with you."</p>

<p>"That is the right of every Apache, to choose for himself," said
Na-chi-ta; "but for the tribe it is better that we make peace and
go back to the reservation. Na-chi-ta will vote for peace if the
pindah-lickoyee will promise not to kill any of us."</p>

<p>"I shall send White Horse, my brother, to arrange for a parley
with the white-eyed chiefs," said Geronimo. The day after White
Horse left upon his mission the renegades sent two squaws into
Fronteras to purchase food and mescal, and as they returned to camp
they were followed to the last, hiding place of the great war chief
of all the Apaches.</p>

<p>Scarcely had the squaws laid aside their burdens when one of
Geronimo's scouts hurried into the camp and reported to the war
chief that two government scouts had come, bringing a message to
Geronimo.</p>

<p>"I will talk with them," said the old chief, and a few minutes
later Ka-yi-tah, the Cho-kon-en, and Marteen, the Ned-ni, stood
before him, the red head-bands of their service alone
differentiating them from the warriors who crowded about them.</p>

<p>"You bring a message from the white-eyed chiefs to Geronimo?"
demanded the war chief.</p>

<p>"With Lieutenant Gatewood we have brought a message from General
Miles, the new chief of the white-eyed soldiers," replied
Ka-yi-tah.</p>

<p>"Speak!" commanded Geronimo.</p>

<p>"The message is that if you will surrender you will not be
killed, but will be taken some place to the East, you and your
families&mdash;all of you who are now upon the war trail and who
will surrender."</p>

<p>"How many soldiers has Gatewood with him?" demanded
Geronimo.</p>

<p>"There are no soldiers with Gatewood," replied Ka-yi-tah, "but
Lawton's soldiers are not far away."</p>

<p>"Geronimo will talk with Gatewood," announced the old chief,
"but with no one else. Gatewood does not tell lies to the Apache.
Tell them not to let any soldiers come near my camp, and I shall
talk with Gatewood. Go!"</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>And so it was that through the confidence that Geronimo felt in
Lieutenant Charles B. Gatewood, Sixth United States Cavalry,
arrangements were made for a parley with General Miles; and on
September 4th 1886 Geronimo and Na-chi-ta surrendered at Skeleton
Canyon, Arizona.</p>

<p>Shoz-Dijiji did not accompany the other chiefs to the parley.
With only his own sad thoughts as company he remained in camp, and
there Geronimo found him when the parley was over. Shoz-Dijiji
arose and faced the old chieftain.</p>

<p>"I do not need to ask Geronimo what has happened," said the
young chief. "I see sorrow in his eyes. It is the end of the
Apaches."</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Geronimo, "it is the end."</p>

<p>"What talk passed between Geronimo and the white-eyed war
chief?" asked Shoz-Dijiji.</p>

<p>"We shook hands; and then we sat down, and the white-eyed war
chief said to Geronimo: 'The President of the United States has
sent me to speak to you. He has heard of your trouble with the
white men, and says that if you will agree to a few words of treaty
we need have no more trouble. Geronimo, if you will agree to a few
words of treaty all will be satisfactorily arranged.'</p>

<p>"He told me how we could be brothers to each other. We raised
our hands to heaven and said that the treaty was not to be broken.
We took an oath not to do any wrong to each other or to scheme
against each other."</p>

<p>"And you believed the pindah-lickoyee?" demanded Shoz-Dijiji.
"Each time that we go upon the war trail they promise us many
things to induce us to lay down our arms&mdash;and do they keep
their promises? No! Nor will they keep this promise."</p>

<p>"I do not know. All that I can do is hope, for no longer can we
fight against them," answered Geronimo, wearily.</p>

<p>"What else said the pindah-lickoyee?" asked the Apache
Devil.</p>

<p>"He talked with me for a long time and told me what he would do
for me in the future if I would agree to the treaty. I did not
greatly believe him, but because the President of the United States
had sent me word I agreed to make the treaty and to keep it.</p>

<p>"He said to me: 'I will take you under government protection; I
will build you a house; I will fence you much land; I will give you
cattle, horses, mules, and farming implements. You will be
furnished with men to work the farm, for you yourself will not have
to work. In the fall I will send you blankets and clothing so that
you will not suffer from cold in the winter time.'</p>

<p>"'There is plenty of timber, water, and grass in the land to
which I shall send you,' he told me. He said that I should live
with my tribe and with my family and that if I agreed to the treaty
I should be with my family within five days.</p>

<p>"Then I said to General Miles: 'All the officers that have been
in charge of the Indians have talked that way, and it sounds like a
story to me; I hardly believe you.'</p>

<p>"'This time,' he said, 'it is the truth,' and he swept a spot of
ground clear with his hand and said: 'Your past deeds shall be
wiped out like this, and you will start a new life.'</p>

<p>"All this talk was translated from English into Spanish and from
Spanish into Apache. It took a long time. Perhaps the interpreters
did not make any mistakes. I do not know."</p>

<p>"Are you going to live on the reservation at San Carlos?" asked
Shoz-Dijiji.</p>

<p>"No. They are going to send us out of Arizona because they say
that the white men whose families and friends we have killed would
always be making a lot of trouble for us, that they would try to
kill us."</p>

<p>"Where are they going to send you?"</p>

<p>"To Fort Marion in a country called Florida." The old man bowed
his head. Could it be that there were tears in those cold blue
eyes? Shoz-Dijiji placed a hand on his father's shoulder.</p>

<p>"I know now that I shall never see you again," he said. "The
pindah-lickoyee, who have never kept a promise that they have made
to the Shis-Inday, will not keep this one. When you have laid down
your arms they will kill you; as they killed Mangas Colorado.</p>

<p>"It is not too late even now to turn back," continued the young
man. "We have ponies, we have arms, we have ammunition; and there
are places in the mountains of Sonora where a few men could elude
the pindah-lickoyee forever. Do not let them take you to a strange
country where they will either kill you or make a slave of
you."</p>

<p>Geronimo shook his head. "No, my son," he said, "that cannot be.
The war chief of the pindah-lickoyee and the war chief of all the
Apaches stood between his troopers and my warriors. We placed a
large stone on the blanket before us. Our treaty was made by this
stone, and it was to last until the stone should crumble to dust.
So we made the treaty and bound each other with an oath. Geronimo
will keep that treaty."</p>

<p>Slowly Shoz-Dijiji turned and walked away. Far up among the
rocks above the rocky camp site he went; and there he remained all
night praying to Usen, praying to Intchi-Dijin, the black wind,
asking for guidance, asking for wisdom; for Shoz-Dijiji, the Black
Bear, did not know what to do.</p>

<p><br>
When morning came he returned to the camp of the renegades; and
there he found his people, sullen and morose, preparing to lay down
their weapons and give themselves up as prisoners of war to the
enemy that they feared, hated, and mistrusted.</p>

<p>He went to the pony herd and caught Nejeunee and brought him
back to camp. Then he squatted beside a rock, and with a bronze
forefinger laid the war paint of the Apache Devil across his face.
Upon his head he placed his war bonnet of buckskin with its crest
of feathers; about his neck he hung a single strand of turquoise
and silver beads; in his ears were small silver rings, and covering
his feet and legs were stout Apache war moccasins.</p>

<p>A belt of ammunition encircled his slim waist, and from it hung
two pistols and a great butcher knife. He carried a rifle and bow
and arrows.</p>

<p>The others saw his preparations, but they made no comment. When
he was done he mounted Nejeunee&mdash;an Apache war chief tricked
out in all the panoply of the war trail.</p>

<p>He rode to where Geronimo sat stolidly upon a pony waiting for
the preparations for departure to be completed. The old war chief
looked up as the younger man approached, but the expression upon
his inscrutable face did not change as he saw the war paint and the
weapons.</p>

<p>"My father," said Shoz-Dijiji, "all night I have prayed in high
places, prayed to Usen and to Intchi-Dijin, asking them to give me
some sign if they wished me to give myself up to the enemy and go
into bondage with Geronimo and our people. But they gave me no
sign, and so I know that they do not wish me to do these things;
and I am satisfied.</p>

<p>"Therefore I ride out alone, the last of the Apaches, upon the
war trail against the enemies of my people. While I live I shall
devote my life to killing the pindah-lickoyee. I, Shoz-Dijiji, war
chief of the Be-don-ko-he, have spoken."</p>

<p>"Wait," said Geronimo. "Wait until you have heard the words of
Geronimo before you bind yourself to such an oath.</p>

<p>"We go into bondage. We shall never take the war trail again.
Had it been otherwise I should never have told you what I am going
to tell you now.</p>

<p>"All your life you have been as a son to me. I have loved you. I
have been proud of you. It is because I love you, Shoz-Dijiji, that
I am going to tell you this thing now. When I have told you you
will know that you need not throw away your life fighting the
pindah-lickoyee, fighting the battles of the Apaches.</p>

<p>"Shoz-Dijiji, you are not an Apache. You are not a Shis-Inday.
You are a pindah-lickoyee."</p>

<p>The eyes of the Apache Devil narrowed. "You are my father," he
said, "but not even you may call Shoz-Dijiji a pindah-lickoyee and
live. That, Juh learned."</p>

<p>Geronimo shook his head sadly. "Juh knew," he said. "He was with
me when we killed your father and mother in a pass in the Stein's
Peak Range. It was Juh who dragged you from the wagon and would
have killed you but for Geronimo."</p>

<p>"It is a lie!" growled Shoz-Dijiji.</p>

<p>"Has Geronimo ever lied to you?" asked the old war chief.</p>

<p>"Cochise swore before the council fire that I was as much an
Apache as he," cried the young man.</p>

<p>"Cochise did not lie," said Geronimo. "You are as much an Apache
as any of us in heart and spirit, but in your veins flows the blood
of your white-eyed father.</p>

<p>"Twenty three times have the rains come since the day that I
killed him; and I have kept my lips sealed because I loved you and
because you were as much my son to me as though you were flesh of
my own flesh; but now the time has come that you should know, for
as an Apache every man's hand will be turned against you, but as a
pindah-lickoyee you will have a chance that no Apache ever may
have."</p>

<p>For a few moments Shoz-Dijiji sat in brooding silence. Presently
he spoke.</p>

<p>"Pindah-lickoyee! White-eyed man!" he cried contemptuously,
almost spitting the words from his mouth. "Had you told me that I
am a coyote I could have carried my shame and faced the world, but
to be a white man!" He shuddered.</p>

<p>"My son," said Geronimo, "it is not the color of our skin or the
blood that runs in our veins that makes us good men or bad men.
There are bad Apaches and there are good white men. It is good to
be a good Apache. It is not bad to be a good white man. Now,
perhaps, it is better to be a good white man than even a good
Apache. Times have changed. Usen does not look with favor upon the
Shis-Inday. Time will heal your wound. Go and live among your own
people, and some day you will thank Geronimo because he told
you."</p>

<p>"Never!" cried the Black Bear. "Good-bye, Geronimo. You have
been a good father to Shoz-Dijiji. Now Shoz-Dijiji has no father.
Shoz-Dijiji has no mother. Shoz-Dijiji has no people, for he is not
an Apache; and he will not be a pindah-lickoyee. But he is still a
war chief of the Apaches. He is the only war chief that goes upon
the war trail. Now, I think, he is the only Apache left in the
world. All the rest of you are pindah-lickoyee, for do you not go
to live with the pindah-lickoyee? Only Shoz-Dijiji lives like an
Apache."</p>

<p>He wheeled Nejeunee about, and then turned on his blanket and
faced Geronimo again.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, Shoz-Dijiji, last of the Apaches, war chief of all
the Apaches, rides out upon the last war trail."</p>

<p>Down the rocky hill side toward the south the pinto war pony
bore his gorgeous master, while an old man, seeing dimly through
blue eyes that were clouded by unaccustomed tears, watched the last
martial gesture of his once powerful people until pinto stallion
and painted war chief disappeared into the blue haze that lay upon
the early morning trail that wound southward toward Sonora.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="chap15" id="chap15">XV. &mdash; THE LAST OF THE
RENEGADES</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">GERONIMO had surrendered! For the first time in
three hundred years the white invaders of Apacheland slept in
peace. All of the renegades were prisoners of war in Florida.
Right, at last, had prevailed. Once more a Christian nation had
exterminated a primitive people who had dared defend their homeland
against a greedy and ruthless invader.</p>

<p>Imprisoned with the renegades, and equally prisoners of war,
were Apaches who had long been loyal and faithful servants to the
government; but what of that! Who was there to defend a friendless
people?&mdash;friendless and voteless.</p>

<p>Transported from the hot, dry uplands of their native country to
the low, damp, malarial surroundings of their prison, the Apaches
sickened and died; others, unable to endure confinement, suffering
the pangs of homesickness, took their own lives.</p>

<p><br>
And down in Sonora, in the inaccessible depths of the Mother of
Mountains, Shoz-Dijiji and Nejeunee shared the hunting and the
pasture with the cougar and the mountain sheep. They trod in the
footsteps of God, where man and horse had never walked before. No
man saw them and, for months on end, they saw no man.</p>
<a id="pic4" name="pic4"><!--Image Anchor--></a><br>

<div align="center"><img src="0300271h-images/ApacheDevil-04.jpg"
alt="Illustration" title="Illustration">
<p class="caption">Shoz-Dijiji and his pinto pony Nejeunee.</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>Long since had Shoz-Dijiji washed the war paint from his face.
He was a hunter now, and upon the rare occasions that he saw other
human beings he experienced no urge to kill them.</p>

<p>He had thought it all out during the long, lonely days and
nights. Geronimo had made treaties with the Mexicans and with the
pindah-lickoyee. He had promised that the Apaches would fight no
more against them. That treaty, Shoz-Dijiji felt, bound him, for
there were no other Apaches than he. He could not, as yet, think of
himself as a pindah-lickoyee. He was an Apache&mdash;the last of
the Apaches.</p>

<p>He promised himself that he would not kill again except in
self-defense. He would show them that it was not the Apaches who
broke treaties, but experience warned him that the only way to keep
peace was to keep hidden from the eyes of man. He knew that the
first one who saw him would shoot at him, if he dared, and that
thereafter he would be hunted like the coyote and the cougar.</p>

<p>"Only we shall know that we are keeping the treaty, Nejeunee,"
he said, and the pinto stallion, nuzzled his shoulder in complete
accord with this or any other view that his beloved master might
hold.</p>

<p>Accustomed to being much alone though he was, yet the man often
longed for the companionship of his kind. He conjured pictures of
camps beneath the pines and cedars of his beloved Arizona hills, of
little fires before rude hogans of boughs and skins. He saw
Geronimo and Sons-ee-ah-ray squatting there; and with them was
Shoz-Dijiji, son of the war chief. These three were always laughing
and happy. Gian-nah-tah came to the fire, and Ish-kay-nay.
Sometimes these were little children and again they were grown to
young man- and woman-hood. He saw many others. Squat, grim
warriors, slender youths, lovely maidens whose great, dark eyes
looked coquettishly at Shoz-Dijiji.</p>

<p>Most of these were dead. The others, bitter, sullen, had marched
away into captivity.</p>

<p>Another figure came, but not to the camp fires of the
Shis-Inday. This one came, always, riding a pony over sun scorched
hills. Shoz-Dijiji took her in his arms; but she drew away,
striking at him. He saw in her eyes, then, a look that he called
the snake look. It made him sad and yet this picture came most
often to his mind.</p>

<p>He wondered if the snake look would come if she knew that he was
a pindah-lickoyee like herself. Perhaps she would not believe it.
It was difficult for him to believe it himself. Had any other than
Geronimo told him he would not have believed it, but he knew that
Geronimo would not lie to him.</p>

<p>Well, she would never know it. It was a shame and a disgrace
that he would hide from the knowledge of all men as long as he
lived. A white-eyes! Usen! What had Shoz-Dijiji done to deserve
this?</p>

<p>But, after all, he was white, he mused. From that fact he could
never escape, and it was very lonely living in the mountains
forever with only Nejeunee. Perhaps the white girl would believe
him; and if she did would it not be better to go and live among the
white-eyes as one of them?</p>

<p>He recalled how he used to pity any who had been born white. It
would not have been quite so bad had he been born a Mexican, for he
knew that there was Indian blood in many of the Mexicans he had
known. It would have comforted him had he known that the
grandfather of his mother had been a full blooded Cherokee, but he
did not know that. He was never to know it, for he was never to
know even the names of his father and mother.</p>

<p>He tried to argue with himself that it was no disgrace to be
white. Wichita Billings was white, and he thought none the less of
her; Lieutenant King was white, and he knew that he was a fine,
brave warrior; and there had been Captain Crawford, and there was
Lieutenant Gatewood. These men he admired and respected.</p>

<p>Yes, it was all right for them to be white; but still the
thought that Shoz-Dijiji, war chief of the Be-don-ko-he, was white
seemed all wrong.</p>

<p>He could not forget the pride that had always filled his heart
because of the fact that he was an Apache. He had been a great
Apache warrior. As a white man he would be nothing. If he went to
live among them he would have to wear their hideous clothing and
live in their stuffy houses; and he would have to live like the
poorest of them, for he would have no money. No, he could not do
it.</p>

<p>He thought about the matter a great deal. The lonelier he became
the more he thought about it. Wichita Billings was constantly the
center of his thoughts. His mind also dwelled upon memories of
happy camping places of the past, and it seemed that the sweetest
memories hung about the home camps of Arizona.</p>

<p>His lonely heart yearned not only for human companionship but
for the grim country that was home to him. Something was happening
to Shoz-Dijiji. He thought that he was sick and that he was going
to die. He was homesick.</p>

<p>"I could go back and die in my own mountains," he thought. The
idea made him almost happy. He stroked Nejeunee's soft muzzle and
his sleek, arched neck. "How would you like to go home, Nejeunee?"
asked Shoz-Dijiji. Nejeunee, after the manner of stallions, nipped
the bronze shoulder of his master; but whether it was to signify
approbation of the suggestion or was merely in the nature of a
caress, only Nejeunee knew.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>Lieutenant Samuel Adams King sat beneath one of the cotton wood
trees that stands in front of the ranch house of the Crazy B Ranch,
his chair tilted back against the bole of the tree. Near him sat
Wichita Billings, her fingers busily engaged in the work that was
commanding their attention. She might have been embroidering her
initials upon a pillow slip or fashioning some dainty bit of
lingerie, but she was not. She was cleaning a six-shooter.</p>

<p>"It sure seems tame around these parts now," she remarked. "Do
you know I almost miss being scared out of seven years' growth
every once in a while since the 'broncos' were rounded up and
shipped to Florida."</p>

<p>"I suppose you are cleaning that pistol, then, just as a
sentimental reminder of the happy days that are gone," laughed
King.</p>

<p>"Not entirely," she replied. "There are still plenty of bad
hombres left&mdash;all the bad ones weren't Indians, not by a jug
full."</p>

<p>"I suppose not," agreed King. "As a matter of fact I doubt if
the Apaches were responsible for half the killings that have been
laid at their door; and, do you know, Chita, I can't bring myself
to believe even yet that it was an Apache that killed your father.
We got it pretty straight from some of the renegades themselves
that at the time they were all with Geronimo in the mountains near
Hot Springs, except those that were still in Sonora, and
Shoz-Dijiji."</p>

<p>"Well, that narrows it down pretty close to one man, doesn't
it?" demanded the girl, bitterly.</p>

<p>"Yes, Chita," replied King, "but I can't believe that he did it.
He spared my life twice merely because I was your friend. If he
could do that, how could he have killed your father?"</p>

<p>"I know, Ad. I've argued it out a hundred times," said the girl,
wearily; "but that thousand dollars reward still stands."</p>

<p>"The chances are that it will stand forever, then," said King.
"Shoz-Dijiji didn't come in with the other renegades; and, of
course, you can't get anything out of them; but it is better than
an even bet that he was killed in Sonora during one of the last
engagements. I know several bucks were killed; but they usually got
them away and buried them, and they never like to talk about their
dead."</p>

<p>"I hope to God that he is dead," said the girl.</p>

<p>King shook his head. He knew how bitterly she must
feel&mdash;more bitterly, perhaps, because the man she suspected
was one to whom she had given her friendship and her aid when he
was bearing arms against her country.</p>

<p>He had not told her of his conviction that Shoz-Dijiji and the
dread Apache Devil were one and the same; and he did not tell her,
for he knew that it would but tend to further assure her of the
guilt of the Apache. There were two reasons why he did not tell
her. One was his loyalty to the savage enemy who had befriended him
and who might still be living. The other was his belief that
Wichita Billings had harbored a warmer feeling than friendship for
the war chief of the Be-don-ko-he, and King was not the type of man
who takes an unfair advantage of a rival.</p>

<p>Perhaps it galled this scion of an aristocratic Boston family to
admit, even to himself, that an untutored savage might have been
his rival in seeking the hand of a girl; but he did not permit the
suspicion to lessen his sense of gratitude to Shoz-Dijiji or dim
the genuine respect he felt for the courage and honor of that
savage warrior.</p>

<p>For a time the two sat in silence, Wichita busy with her
revolver, King feasting his eyes upon her regular profile.</p>

<p>"Everything on the ranch running smoothly?" he asked,
presently.</p>

<p>Wichita shook her head. "Not like they did when Dad was here,"
she admitted. "The boys are good to me, but it's not like having a
man at the head of things. Some of them don't like 'Smooth' and
I've lost several of my best men on that account. A couple of them
quit, and 'Smooth' fired some. I can't interfere. As long as he's
foreman he's got to be foreman. The minute the boys think I've lost
confidence in him he won't have any more authority over them than a
jack rabbit."</p>

<p>"Are you satisfied with him?" asked King.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;he sure knows his business," she replied; "you'd
have to hunt a month of Sundays before you found a better cow man;
but he can't get the work out of his men. They don't feel any
loyalty for him. They used to cuss Dad; and I've seen more than one
of them pull a gun on him, but they'd work their fool heads off for
him. They'd get sore as pups and quit; but they always came
back&mdash;if he'd take them&mdash;and when he died, Ad, I saw men
crying that I bet hadn't cried before since they were babies."</p>

<p>"That is like the old man," said King, thinking of his troop
commander. "Gosh! How I have hated that fellow&mdash;and while I'm
hating him I can't help but love him. There are men like that, you
know."</p>

<p>"They are the real men, I guess," mused Wichita; "they don't
grow on every sage brush, not by a long shot."</p>

<p>"Why don't you sell out, Chita?" King asked her. "This is no job
for a girl&mdash;it's a man's job, and you haven't the man for
it."</p>

<p>"Lord, I wouldn't know what to do, Ad," she cried. "I'd be plumb
lost. Why, this is my life&mdash;I don't know anything else. I
belong here on a cow ranch in Arizona, and here I'm going to
stay."</p>

<p>"But you don't belong here, Chita," he insisted. "You belong on
a throne, with a retinue of slaves and retainers waiting on
you."</p>

<p>She leaned back and laughed merrily. "And the first thing I'd
know the king would catch me eating peas with my knife and pull the
throne out from under me."</p>

<p>"I'm serious, Chita," urged King. "Come with me; let me take you
away from this. The only throne I can offer you is in my heart, but
it will be all yours&mdash;forever."</p>

<p>"I'd like to, Ad," she replied. "You don't know how great the
temptation is, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then why not?" he exclaimed, rising and coming toward her. "We
could be married at the post; and I could get a short leave, I'm
sure, even though I haven't been in the service two years. All your
worries about the ranch would be over. You wouldn't have anything
to do, Chita, but be happy."</p>

<p>"It wouldn't be fair, Ad," she said.</p>

<p>"Fair? What do you mean?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"It wouldn't be fair to you."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because I don't know whether I love you enough or not."</p>

<p>"I'll take the chance," he told her. "I'll make you love
me."</p>

<p>She shook her head. "If I was going to marry a man and face a
life that I was sure was going to be worse than the one I was
leaving, I'd know that I loved him; and I wouldn't hesitate a
minute; but if I marry you it might just be because what you have
to offer me looks like heaven compared to the life I've been
leading since Dad died. I think too much of you and my self respect
to take the chance of waking up to the fact some day that I don't
love you. That would be Hell for us both, Ad; and you don't deserve
it&mdash;you're too white."</p>

<p>"I tell you that I'm perfectly willing to take the chance,
Chita."</p>

<p>"Yes, but I won't let you. Wait a while. If I really love you
I'll find it out somehow, and you'll know it&mdash;if you don't
I'll tell you&mdash;but I'm not sure now."</p>

<p>"Is there someone else, Chita?"</p>

<p>"No!" she cried, and her vehemence startled him.</p>

<p>"I'll wait, then, because I have to wait," he said, "and in the
meantime if there is any way in which I can help you, let me do
it."</p>

<p>"Well," she said, laughing, "you might teach the cows how to
drill. I can't think of anything else around a cow outfit, right
off-hand, that you could do. Sometimes it seems to me like they
didn't have any cows back where you came from."</p>

<p>King laughed. "They used to. All the streets in Boston were laid
out by cows, they say."</p>

<p>"Out here," said Chita, "we drive our cows&mdash;we don't follow
them."</p>

<p>"Perhaps that's the difference between the East and the West,"
said King. "Out here you blaze your own trails. I guess that's
where you get your self-confidence and initiative."</p>

<p>"And it may account for some of our short-comings, too," she
replied. "Where you're just following cows you have lots of time to
think of other things and improve yourself, but when you're driving
them you haven't time to think of anything except just cows. That's
the fix I'm in now."</p>

<p>"When you have discovered that you might learn to love me you
will have time for other things," he reminded her.</p>

<p>"Time to improve myself?" she teased.</p>

<p>"Nothing could improve you in my eyes, Chita," he said,
honestly. "To me you are perfect."</p>

<p>"If Margaret Cullis hadn't taught me that it was vulgar I should
say 'Rats' to that."</p>

<p>"Please&mdash;don't."</p>

<p>"I won't," she promised. "And now you must run along. You know
your orders never said anything about spending two hours at the
Billings ranch this afternoon. What will your detachment
think?"</p>

<p>"They'll think I'm a fool if I don't stay all afternoon and ride
back to the post in the cool of the night."</p>

<p>"And get court-martialed when you get there. Boots and saddles
for you, Lieutenant Samuel Adams King!"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir!" he cried, clicking his heels together and saluting.
Then he seized her hand and kissed it.</p>

<p>"Don't!" she whispered, snatching it away. "Here comes
Luke."</p>

<p>"I don't care if the World's coming."</p>

<p>"That's because you don't know what it is to be joshed by a
bunch of cow punchers," she told him. "Say, why when it comes to
torture, Victorio and Geronimo and old Whoa could have gone to
school to some of these red necks from the Pan Handle."</p>

<p>"All right, I won't embarrass you. Good-bye and good luck, and
don't forget the message I brought from Mrs. Cullis. She wants you
to come and spend a week or so with her."</p>

<p>"Tell her I thank her heaps and that I'll come the first chance
I get. Good-bye!"</p>

<p>She watched him walk away, tall, erect, soldierly; trim in his
blue blouse, his yellow striped breeches, his cavalry boots, and
campaign hat&mdash;a soldier, every inch of him and, though still a
boy, a veteran already.</p>

<p>And she sighed&mdash;sighed because she did not love him, sighed
because she was afraid that she would never love him. Lines of
bitterness touched the corners of her mouth and her eyes as she
thought of the beautiful and priceless thing that she had thrown
away&mdash;wasted upon a murdering savage&mdash;and a flush of
shame tinged her cheeks.</p>

<p>Her painful reveries were interrupted by the voice of Luke
Jensen.</p>

<p>"I jest been ridin' the east range, Miss," he said.</p>

<p>"Yes? Everything all right?"</p>

<p>"I wouldn't say thet it was an' I wouldn't say thet it wasn't,"
he replied.</p>

<p>"What's wrong?"</p>

<p>"You recollect thet bunch thet always hung out near the head o'
the coulee where them cedars grows out o' the rocks?"</p>

<p>"Yes, what about them?"</p>

<p>"They's about half of 'em gone. If they was all gone I'd think
they might have drifted to some other part o' the range; but they
was calves, yearlin's, and some two-an' three-year-olds still
follerin' their mothers in thet bunch; an' a bunch like thet don't
scatter fer no good reason."</p>

<p>"No. What do you make of it, Luke?"</p>

<p>"If the renegades warn't all c'ralled I'd say Apaches."</p>

<p>"'Kansas' reported another bunch broken up that ranges around
the Little Mesa," said Wichita, thoughtfully. "Do you reckon it's
rustlers, Luke?"</p>

<p>"I wouldn't say it was an' I wouldn't say it wasn't."</p>

<p>"What does 'Smooth' say?"</p>

<p>"He allows they just natch'rally drifted."</p>

<p>"Are you riding the east range every day, Luke?"</p>

<p>"Most days. Course it takes me nigh onto a week to cover it, an'
oncet in a while 'Smooth' sends me somers else. Yistiddy, he sent
me plumb down to the south ranch&mdash;me an' 'Kansas'."</p>

<p>"Well, keep your eyes open for that bunch, Luke&mdash;they might
have drifted."</p>

<p>"Well, I wouldn't say they would of and I wouldn't say they
wouldn't of."</p>

<h2><a name="chap16" id="chap16">XVI. &mdash; THE JACK OF
SPADES</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">LUIS MARIEL, profiting by the example of the
Americanos, stood up to "Dirty" Cheetim's bar and drank cheap
whiskey.</p>

<p>"Wot you doin', Kid?" asked Cheetim.</p>

<p>"Nothing," replied Luis.</p>

<p>"Want a job, or hev you still got some dinero left?"</p>

<p>"I want a job," replied Luis. "I am broke."</p>

<p>"You got a hoss, ain't you?"</p>

<p>"Si, se&ntilde;or."</p>

<p>"Come 'ere," he motioned Luis to follow him into the back
room.</p>

<p>There Luis saw a tall man with sandy hair sitting at a table,
drinking.</p>

<p>"Here's a good kid fer us," said Cheetim to the sandy haired
man. "He aint been up here long; an' nobody don't know him, an' he
don't know nobody."</p>

<p>"Does he savvy U.S.?" demanded the man.</p>

<p>"Si, se&ntilde;or," spoke up Luis. "I understand pretty good. I
speak it pretty good, too."</p>

<p>"Can you keep your mouth shut?"</p>

<p>"Si, se&ntilde;or."</p>

<p>"If you don't, somebody'll shut it for you," said the man,
drawing his forefinger across his throat meaningfully. "You
savvy?"</p>

<p>"What is this job?" demanded Luis.</p>

<p>"You aint got nothin' to do but herd a little bunch o' cattle
an' keep your trap closed. If anyone asks you any questions in
United States you don't savvy; and if they talk Greaser to you, why
you don't know nothin' about the cattle except that a kind old
gentleman hired you to ride herd on 'em."</p>

<p>"Si, se&ntilde;or."</p>

<p>"You get thirty five a month an' your grub&mdash;twenty five fer
ridin' herd an' the rest fer not knowin' nothin'. How about
it?"</p>

<p>"Sure, se&ntilde;or, I do it."</p>

<p>"All right, you come along with me. We'll ride out, an' I'll
show you where the bunch is," and the sandy haired man gulped down
another drink and arose.</p>

<p>He led Luis north into the reservation, and at last they came to
a bunch of about fifty head grazing contentedly on rather good
pasture.</p>

<p>"They aint so hard to hold," said the sandy haired man, "but
they got a hell of a itch to drift east sometimes. They's a c'ral
up thet draw a ways. You puts 'em in there nights and lets 'em
graze durin' the day. You won't hev to hold 'em long." He took a
playing card from his pocket&mdash;the jack of spades&mdash;and
tore it in two. One half he handed to Luis. "When a feller comes
with tother half o' this card, Kid, you let him hev the cattle.
Savvy?"</p>

<p>"Si, se&ntilde;or."</p>

<p>"Oncet in a while they may a couple fellers come up with some
more critters fer you. You jest let 'em drive 'em in with your
bunch. You don't hev to say nothin' nor ask no questions.
Savvy?"</p>

<p>"Si, se&ntilde;or."</p>

<p>"All right. Let' em graze til sundown; then c'ral 'em and come
down to the Hog Ranch fer the night. You kin make down your bed
back o' the barn. The Chink'll feed you. So long, Kid."</p>

<p>"Adios, se&ntilde;or." Luis Mariel, watching the tall, sandy
haired man ride away, tucked his half of the jack of spades into
the breast pocket of his shirt, rolled a cigarette, and then rode
leisurely among the grazing cattle, inspecting his charges.</p>

<p>He noted the marks and brands, and discovering that several were
represented, concluded that Cheetim and the sandy haired man were
collecting a bunch for sale or shipment. Impressed by the
injunction to silence laid upon him, and being no fool, Luis opined
that the cattle had come into their possession through no lawful
processes.</p>

<p>But that they had been stolen was no affair of his. He had not
stolen them. He was merely employed to herd them. It interested him
to note that fully ninety percent of the animals bore the Crazy B
brand on the left hip, a slit in the right ear, and a half crop off
the left, the remainder being marked by various other brands, some
of which he recognized and some of which he did not.</p>

<p>The Crazy B brand he knew quite well as it was one of the
foremost brands in that section of Arizona. He had tried to get
work with that outfit when he had brought the pinto stallion up
from the border for El Teniente King. At that time he had talked
with Se&ntilde;or Billings, who had since been killed by Apaches;
but he had been unable to secure employment with him. Later he had
learned that the Billings ranch never employed Mexicans, and while
knowledge of this fact aroused no animosity within him neither did
it impose upon him any sentiment of obligation to apprise the
owners of the brand of his suspicion that someone was stealing
their cattle.</p>

<p>Luis Mariel was far from being either a criminal or vicious
young man. He would not have stolen cattle himself, but it was none
of his business how his employers obtained the cattle that he was
hired to herd for them. Since he had come up from Mexico he had
found means of livelihood through many and various odd employments,
sometimes as laborer, sometimes as chore boy, occasionally in
riding for some small cow outfit, which was the thing of all others
that he liked best to do. It was the thing that Luis Mariel loved
best and did best.</p>

<p>More recently he had been reduced to the expedience of
performing the duties of porter around the bar of "Dirty" Cheetim's
Hog Ranch in order that he might eat to live and live to eat. Here,
his estimate of the Gringoes had not been materially raised.</p>

<p>Pedro Mariel, the woodchopper of Casa Grande, was a poor man in
worldly goods; but in qualities of heart and conscience he had been
rich, and he had raised his children to fear God and do right.</p>

<p>Luis often thought of his father as he watched the Gringoes
around "Dirty" Cheetim's place, and at night he would kneel down
and thank God that he was a Mexican.</p>

<p>Many of the Gringoes that he saw were not bad, only fools; but
there were many others who were very bad indeed. El Teniente King
was the best Americano he had ever seen. Luis was sorry that El
Teniente had no riding job for him. These were some of the thoughts
that passed through the mind of the Mexican youth as he rode herd
on the stolen cattle.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p class="first">Up from the south rode Shoz-Dijiji. From the
moment that he crossed the border into Arizona his spirits rose.
The sight of familiar and beloved scenes, the scent of the cedars
and the pines, the sunlight and the moonlight were like wine in his
veins. The Black Bear was almost happy again.</p>

<p>Where there were no trails he went unseen. No longer were the
old water holes guarded by the soldiers of the pindah-lickoyee.
Peace lay upon the battle ground of three hundred years. He saw
prospectors and cowboys occasionally, but they did not see
Shoz-Dijiji. The war chief of the Be-don-ko-he knew that the safety
of peace was for the white-eyed men only&mdash;he was still a
renegade, an outlaw, a hunted beast, fair target for the rifle of
the first white man who saw him.</p>

<p>He moved slowly, and often by night, drinking to the full the
joys of his homeland; but he moved toward a definite goal and with
a well defined purpose. It had taken days and weeks and months of
meditation and introspection to lay the foundation for the decision
he had finally reached; it had necessitated trampling under foot a
lifetime of race consciousness and pride in caste; it had required
the sacrifice of every cherished ideal, but the incentive was more
powerful than any of these things, perhaps the greatest single
moral force for good or evil that exists to govern and shape the
destinies of man&mdash;love.</p>

<p>Love was driving this Apache war chief to the object of his
devotion and to the public avowal that he was no Apache but, in
reality, a member of the race that he had always looked upon with
the arrogant contempt of a savage chieftain.</p>

<p>In his return through Arizona he found his loved friend,
Nejeunee, an obstacle to safe or rapid progress. A pinto pony,
while perhaps camouflaged by Nature, is not, at best, an easy thing
to conceal, nor can it follow the trackless steeps of rugged
mountains as can a lone Apache warrior; but, none the less,
Shoz-Dijiji would not abandon this, his last remaining friend, the
sole and final tie that bound him to the beloved past; and so the
two came at last to an upland country, hallowed by sacred
memories&mdash;memories that were sweet and memories that were
bitter.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>Luke Jensen was riding the east range. What does a lone cowboy
think about? There is usually an old bull that younger bulls have
run out of the herd. He is always wandering off, and if he be of
any value it is necessary to hunt him up and explain to him the
error of his ways in profane and uncomplimentary language while
endeavoring to persuade him to return. He occupies the thoughts of
the lone cowboy to some extent.</p>

<p>Then there is the question of the expenditure of accumulated
wages, if any have accumulated. There are roulette and faro and
stud at the Hog Ranch, but if one has recently emerged from any of
these one is virtuous and has renounced them all for life, along
with wine and women.</p>

<p>A hand-made, silver mounted bit would look as well and arouse
envy, as would sheep skin chaps, and a heavy, silver hat band. A
new and more brilliant bandana is also in order. Then there are the
perennial plans for breaking into the cattle business on one's own
hook, based on starting modestly with a few feeders to which second
thought may add a maverick or two that nobody would miss and from
these all the way up to rustling an entire herd.</p>

<p>Thoughts of Apaches had formerly impinged persistently upon the
minds of lone cowboys. Luke Jensen was mighty glad, as he rode the
east range, that he didn't have to bother his head any more about
renegades.</p>

<p>He was riding up a coulee flanked by low hills. Below the brow
of one that lay ahead of him an Apache war chief watched his
approach. Below and behind the warrior a pinto stallion lay
stretched upon its side, obedient to the command of its master.</p>

<p>Shoz-Dijiji, endowed by Nature with keen eyes and a retentive
memory, both of which had been elevated by constant lifelong
exercise to approximate perfection, recognized Luke long before the
cowboy came opposite his position&mdash;knew him even before he
could discern his features.</p>

<p>"Hey, you!" called Shoz-Dijiji without exposing himself to the
view of the youth.</p>

<p>Luke reined in and looked about. Mechanically his hand went to
the butt of his six-shooter.</p>

<p>"No shoot!" said Shoz-Dijiji. "I am friend."</p>

<p>"How the hell do I know that?" demanded Jensen. "I can't see
you, an' I aint takin' no chances."</p>

<p>"I got you covered with rifle," announced Shoz-Dijiji. "You
better be friend and put away gun. I no shoot. I am
Shoz-Dijiji."</p>

<p>"Oh!" exclaimed Jensen. The one thousand dollars reward
instantly dominated his thoughts.</p>

<p>"You no shoot?" demanded the Indian.</p>

<p>Luke returned his revolver to its holster. "Come on down," he
said. "I remember you."</p>

<p>Shoz-Dijiji spoke to Nejeunee, who scrambled to his feet; and a
moment later the pinto stallion and its rider were coming down the
hillside.</p>

<p>"We thought you was dead," said Luke.</p>

<p>"No. Shoz-Dijiji been long time in Sonora."</p>

<p>"Still on the war path?" asked the cowboy.</p>

<p>"Geronimo make treaty with the Mexicans and with your General
Miles," explained the Apache. "He promise we never fight again
against the Mexicans or the Americans. Shoz-Dijiji keep the treaty
Geronimo made. Shoz-Dijiji will not fight unless they make him.
Even the coyote will fight for his life."</p>

<p>"What you come back here fer, Shoz-Dijiji?" asked Luke.</p>

<p>"I come to see Wichita Billings. Mebby so I get job here. What
you think?"</p>

<p>Many thoughts crowded themselves rapidly through the mind of
Luke Jensen in the instant before he replied and foremost among
them was the conviction that this man could not be the murderer of
Jefferson Billings. Had he been he would have known that suspicion
would instantly attach to him from the fact that Wichita had seen
him near the ranch the day her father was killed and that on that
same day the pony he now rode had been stolen from the east
pasture.</p>

<p>"Well, what do you think about it, Shoz-Dijiji?" parried
Luke.</p>

<p>"I think mebby so she give me' job, but Shoz-Dijiji not so damn
sure about her father. He no like Shoz-Dijiji."</p>

<p>"Don't you know that her ol' man's dead?" demanded Luke.</p>

<p>"Dead? No, Shoz-Dijiji not know that. Shoz-Dijiji been down in
Sonora long time. How he die?"</p>

<p>"He was murdered jest outside the east pasture
and&mdash;scalped," said Luke.</p>

<p>"You mean by Apaches?"</p>

<p>"No one knows, but it looks damn suspicious."</p>

<p>"When this happen?" demanded Shoz-Dijiji.</p>

<p>"We found him the mornin' after you took thet there pony out of
the east pasture."</p>

<p>Shoz-Dijiji sat in silence for a moment, his inscrutable face
masking whatever emotions were stirring within his breast.</p>

<p>"You mean they think Shoz-Dijiji kill Billings? Does Chita think
that, too?"</p>

<p>"Look here, Shoz-Dijiji," said Jensen, kindly, "you done me a
good turn oncet thet I aint a-never goin' to forgit. I don't mind
tellin' you I aint never thought you killed the ol' man, but
everyone else thinks so."</p>

<p>"Even Chita?" asked Shoz-Dijiji.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't say she does and I wouldn't say she doesn't, but she
aint never took off the thousand dollar reward she offered to any
hombre what would bring you in dead."</p>

<p>Not by the quiver of an eyelid did Shoz-Dijiji reveal the
anguish of his tortured heart as he listened to the words that
blasted forever the sole hope of happiness that had buoyed him
through the long days and nights of his journey up through hostile
Sonora and even more hostile Arizona.</p>

<p>"You get one thousand dollars, you kill me?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yep."</p>

<p>"Why you no kill me, then?"</p>

<p>Jensen shrugged. "I reckon it must be for the same reason you
didn't kill me when you had the chancet, Shoz-Dijiji," he replied.
"There must be a streak of white in both of us."</p>

<p>"Good-bye," said Shoz-Dijiji, abruptly. "I go now."</p>

<p>"Say, before you go would you mind tellin' me fer sure thet it
wasn't you killed the ol' man?" asked Luke.</p>

<p>Shoz-Dijiji looked the other squarely in the eyes. "If Wichita
Billings offer one thousand dollar reward to have Shoz-Dijiji
killed she must <i>know</i> Shoz-Dijiji kill her father. Good-bye.
Shoz-Dijiji ride straight up coulee, slowly. Mebby so you want one
thousand dollars, now you get it. Sabe?" He wheeled Nejeunee and
walked the pony slowly away while Luke Jensen, slouching in his
saddle, watched him until he had disappeared beyond a low
ridge.</p>

<p>Not once did Jensen experience any urge to reach for the
six-shooter at his hip or the rifle in its boot beneath his right
leg.</p>

<p>"I could shore use a thousand dollars," he mused as he turned
his pony's head back toward the Crazy B Ranch, "but I don't want it
thet bad."</p>

<p>As he rode into the ranch yard later in the afternoon he saw
Wichita Billings standing near the bunk house talking with
"Kansas." Luke was of a mind to avoid her, feeling, as he did, that
he should report his meeting with Shoz-Dijiji and dreading to do so
because of the fear that a posse would be organized to go out and
hunt the Apache down the moment that it was learned that he was in
the vicinity.</p>

<p>But when Wichita saw him she called to him, and there was
nothing less that he could do than go to her. She had finished her
conversation with "Kansas," and the latter had gone into the bunk
house when Luke reached her side.</p>

<p>"Walk up to the office with me, Luke," said the girl. "I want to
talk with you," and he fell in beside her as she walked along. "I
have just been talking with 'Kansas,'" she continued, "and he tells
me that a few head are missing off the north range. Did you miss
any today or see anything unusual?"</p>

<p>Had he seen anything unusual! There was a poser. Luke scratched
his head.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't say that they was any more critters missin';" he
replied, "an' I wouldn't say as they wasn't."</p>

<p>He looked down at the ground in evident embarrassment. Wichita
Billings, who knew these boys better than they knew themselves,
eyed him suspiciously. They walked on in silence for a few
moments.</p>

<p>"Look here, Luke," said the girl, presently. "Someone is
stealing my cattle. I don't know who to trust. I've always looked
to 'Smooth' and you and 'Kansas' and Matt as being the ones I sure
could tie to. If you boys don't shoot straight with me no one
will."</p>

<p>"Who said I warn't shootin' straight with you, Miss?" demanded
Luke.</p>

<p>"I say so," replied Wichita. "You're holding something out on
me. Say, I can read you just like a mail order catalogue. If you
don't come clean you're through your pay check's waiting for you
right now."</p>

<p>"I kin always git another job," parried Luke, lamely.</p>

<p>"Sure you can; but that isn't the question, Luke," replied the
girl, sadly.</p>

<p>"I know it ain't, Miss," and Luke dug a toe into the loose earth
beneath the cottonwood tree. "I did see somethin' onusual today,"
he blurted suddenly.</p>

<p>"I thought so. What was it?"</p>

<p>"An Apache&mdash;Shoz-Dijiji."</p>

<p>Wichita Billings' eyes went wide. Involuntarily her hand went to
her breast, and she caught her breath in a little gasp before she
spoke.</p>

<p>"You shot him?" The words were a barely audible whisper. "You
shot him for the reward?"</p>

<p>"I shore did not," snapped Luke. "Look here, Miss, you kin have
my job any time you want it, but you nor no one else kin make me
double cross a hombre what saved my life&mdash;I don't give a damn
who he killed&mdash;I beg yore pardon, Miss&mdash;and anyway I
haint never believed he did kill your paw."</p>

<p>In his righteous indignation Luke Jensen had failed to note what
appeared to be the relaxation of vast relief that claimed Wichita
Billings the instant that he announced that he had not shot
Shoz-Dijiji. Could it be that Wichita, too, had her doubts?</p>

<p>"Did you ask him about the killing?" Demanded the girl.</p>

<p>"Yep."</p>

<p>"What did he say? Did he deny it?"</p>

<p>"Well, I wouldn't say he did and I wouldn't say he didn't."</p>

<p>"Just what did he say?"</p>

<p>"He said that ef you was offerin' a thousand dollars fer him
dead you must be plumb shore he done it."</p>

<p>"How did he know about the reward?"</p>

<p>"I told him."</p>

<p>"You told him?"</p>

<p>"Shore I did. I don't think he done it. Ef I hadn't told him he
was a comin' here an' some of the fellers would have plugged him
shore. You ain't mad, are you?"</p>

<p>"You are very sure he didn't kill Dad, aren't you, Luke?"</p>

<p>"Yep, plumb certain."</p>

<p>"But he didn't deny it, did he?"</p>

<p>"No, an' he didn't admit it, neither."</p>

<p>"There may be some doubt, Luke. I'm going to draw down that
offer, because I can't take the chance of being mistaken; but as
long as I live I shall believe in my heart that Shoz-Dijiji killed
my father. If you ever see him again, tell him that the reward has
been called off; and tell him, too, that if ever I see him I'll
kill him, just like I think he killed my Dad; but I can't ask
anyone else to. Send 'Smooth' here when you go back to the bunk
house."</p>

<p>As Luke was walking away the girl called to him.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute, Luke, there is something else," she said. "I
have just been thinking," she continued, when the youth was near
her again, "that the Indian you saw today might have had something
to do with the cattle stealing. Had you thought of that?"</p>

<p>Luke scratched his head. "No, ma'am, I hedn't thought of that;
but now that you mention it I reckon as how it ain't at all
unlikely. I never seen one yet that wouldn't steal."</p>

<p>"I guess we're on the right trail now, Luke," said the girl.
"Don't say anything to anyone about seeing him. Just keep your eyes
open, and let me know the minute you see anything out of the
way."</p>

<p>"All right, Miss, I'll keep a right smart look out," and Jensen
turned and walked toward the bunk house.</p>

<p>As Wichita waited for her foreman her thoughts were overcast by
clouds of sorrow and regret. The animosities that were directed
upon Shoz-Dijiji were colored by the shame she felt for having
permitted her heart to surrender itself to an Indian. That she had
never openly admitted the love that she had once harbored for a
savage did not reconcile her, nor did the fact that she had
definitely and permanently uprooted the last vestige of this love
and nurtured hatred in its stead completely clear her
conscience.</p>

<p>It angered her that even while she vehemently voiced her belief
that Shoz-Dijiji had killed her father she still had doubts that
refused to die. She was bitter in the knowledge that though she had
suggested that he was stealing her cattle, deep in her heart she
could not bring herself to believe it of him.</p>

<p>Her somber reveries were interrupted by the approach of
Kreff.</p>

<p>"There are a couple of things I wanted to speak to you about,
'Smooth,'" said the girl.</p>

<p>"Fire away, Chita," said the man, with easy familiarity.</p>

<p>"In the first place I want you to pass the word around that the
reward for bringing in that Apache is off."</p>

<p>"Why?" demanded the man.</p>

<p>"That's my business," replied the girl, shortly. The words and
her tone reminded Kreff of the dead Boss&mdash;she was her father
allover&mdash;and he said no more.</p>

<p>"The other thing is this report about cattle stealing," she
continued.</p>

<p>"Who said there was any cattle stealin' goin' on?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Luke has missed a few head off the east range."</p>

<p>"Oh, that kid's loco," said Kreff. "They've drifted, an' he's
too plumb lazy to hunt 'em up."</p>

<p>"'Kansas' has missed some, too, from up around the Little Mesa
on the north range," she insisted. "I don't know so much about
Luke, he hasn't been with us so long; but 'Kansas' is an old
hand&mdash;he's not the kind to do much guessing."</p>

<p>"I'll look into it, Chita," said Kreff, "an' don't you worry
your little head no more about it." There was something in his tone
that made her glance up quickly, knitting her brows. His voice was
low and soothing and protective. It didn't sound like "Smooth"
Kreff in spite of his nickname, which, she happened to know, was
indicative of the frictionless technique with which he separated
other men from their belongings in the application of the art of
draw and stud.</p>

<p>"You hadn't ought to hev nothin' to worry you," he continued.
"This here business is a man's job. It ain't right an' fittin' thet
a girl should hev to bother with sech things."</p>

<p>"Well, that's what I've got you and the other boys for,
'Smooth.'"</p>

<p>"Yes, but hired hands ain't the same. You ought to be
married&mdash;to a good cow man," he added.</p>

<p>"Meaning?" she inquired.</p>

<p>"Me."</p>

<p>"Are you proposing to me, 'Smooth'?"</p>

<p>"I shore am. What do you say? You an' me could run this outfit
together fine, an' you wouldn't never hev to worry no more about
nothin'."</p>

<p>"But I don't love you, 'Smooth.'"</p>

<p>"Oh, shucks, that aint nothin'. They's a heap o' women marry men
they don't love. They git to lovin' 'em afterwards, though."</p>

<p>"But you don't love me."</p>

<p>"I shore do, Chita. I've allus loved you."</p>

<p>"Well, you've managed to hide it first rate," she observed.</p>

<p>"They didn't never seem no chance, 'til now," he explained; "but
you got a lot o' horse sense, an' I reckon you kin see as well as
me thet it would be the sensible thing to do. You cain't marry
nothin' but a cow man, an' they ain't no other cow man thet I knows
of thet would be much of a improvement over me. You'll larn to love
me, all right. I aint so plumb ugly, an' I won't never beat you
up."</p>

<p>Wichita laughed. "You're sure tootin', 'Smooth,'" she said.
"There isn't a man on earth that's ever going to try to beat me up,
more than once."</p>

<p>Kreff grinned. "You don't hev to tell me that, Chita," he said.
"I reckon that's one o' the reasons I'm so strong fer you&mdash;you
shore would make one grand woman fer a man in this country."</p>

<p>"Well, 'Smooth,' as a business proposition there is something in
what you say that it won't do any harm to think about, but as a
proposal of marriage it hasn't got any more bite to it than a white
pine dog with a poplar tail."</p>

<p>"But you'll think it over, Chita?" he asked, drawing a sack of
Durham and a package of brown papers from his shirt pocket.</p>

<p>"You dropped something, 'Smooth,'" she said; gesturing toward
the ground at his feet. "You pulled it out of your pocket with the
makings."</p>

<p>He looked down at a bit of paste board, at one half of a playing
card that had been torn in two&mdash;one half of the jack of
spades.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="chap17" id="chap17">XVII. &mdash; CHEETIM STRIKES!</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">IT was night. The oil lamps were burning brightly
in the bar-room of the Hog Ranch. The games were being well
patronized. The girls were circulating among the customers,
registering thirst. It looked like a large night.</p>

<p>In the back room two men, seated at opposite sides of a table,
were conversing in low tones. A bottle, two glasses, and a
mutilated jack of spades lay between them. One of the men was
Cheetim, the other was Kreff.</p>

<p>"How much longer does thet feller think we kin hold them
critters without hevin' every galoot in the Territory ridin' onto
'em an' blowin' the whole business?" demanded Kreff.</p>

<p>"I been tellin' him to see you," said Cheetim. Kreff pushed the
jack of spades across the table to the other man.</p>

<p>"You take this," he said. "You see him oftener than I do. Don't
turn this over to him 'til you git the money, but tell him that ef
he don't get a hump on hisself we'll drive the bunch north an' sell
'em up there. They can't stay around here much longer&mdash;the
girl's wise now thet somethin's wrong. Two of the hands has told
her they been missin' stock lately!"</p>

<p>Cheetim sat in silence, thinking. Slowly he filled Kreff's
glass, and poured another drink for himself.</p>

<p>"Here's how!" he said and drank.</p>

<p>"How!" replied Kreff.</p>

<p>"I been thinkin'," said Cheetim.</p>

<p>"Don't strain yourself, 'Dirty,'" Kreff admonished him.</p>

<p>"It's this-a-way," continued the other, ignoring Kreff's
pleasantry. "Ef it warn't for the girl we could clean up big on
thet herd. This here Agent'll buy anything an' not ask no
questions."</p>

<p>"What do you want me to do," inquired Kreff, "kill her?"</p>

<p>"I want you to help me get her. Ef I kin get her fer a few days
she'll be glad enough to marry me. Then I'll give you half what I
get out of the cattle."</p>

<p>"Ride your own range, 'Dirty,'" said Kreff, rising, "and keep
off o' mine."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Ef either one of us gets her it's me, that's what I mean."
There was an ugly edge to his voice that Cheetim did not fail to
note.</p>

<p>"Oh, hell," he said, "I didn't know you was sweet on her."</p>

<p>"You know it now&mdash;keep off the grass."</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p class="first">A pinto stallion, tied to a stunted cedar, dozed
in the mid-day heat. His master, sprawled at the summit of a rocky
knoll, looked down upon the other side at a bunch of cattle resting
until it should be cooler, the while they pensively chewed their
cuds. A youth lay upon his back beneath the shade of a tree. A
saddled pony, with drooping head and ears, stood near by lazily
switching its tail in mute remonstrance against the flies. Bridle
reins, dragging on the ground, suggested to the pony that it was
tethered and were all-sufficient. Somnolence, silence,
heat&mdash;Arizona at high noon.</p>

<p>Shoz-Dijiji surveyed the scene. With a reward of a thousand
dollars on his head it behooved him to survey all scenes in
advance. The reward, however, was but a secondary stimulus.
Training and environment had long since fixed upon him the habit of
reconnaissance. Immediately he had recognized Luis Mariel. If he
were surprised he gave no evidence of it, for his expression did
not change. His eyes wandered over the herd. They noted the various
brands, ear-marks, wattles, jug-handles, and though Shoz-Dijiji
could not have been termed a cattle man he read them all and knew
the ranch and range of every animal in the bunch, for there was no
slightest thing from one end of Apacheland to the other that an
Apache let pass as of too slight importance to concern him. He saw
that most of the cattle belonged to Wichita Billings, but he knew
that it was not a Crazy B cowboy that was herding them, for the
Crazy B outfit employed no Mexicans.</p>

<p>Long before Luis Mariel was aware of the fact Shoz-Dijiji knew
that several horsemen were approaching; but he did not change his
position since, if they continued in the direction they were going,
they would pass without seeing him.</p>

<p>Presently four men rode into view. He recognized them all. Two
of them were Navajoes, one a half-breed and the fourth a white
man&mdash;the Indian Agent.</p>

<p>Shoz-Dijiji did not like any of them, especially the Indian
Agent. He fingered his rifle and wished that Geronimo had not made
that treaty with General Miles in Skeleton Canyon. Presently Luis
heard the footfalls of the approaching horses and sat up. Seeing
the men, he arose. They rode up to him, and the Agent spoke.
Shoz-Dijiji saw him take a bit of paper from his pocket and show it
to Luis. Luis took another similar bit of paper from his own pocket
and compared it with the one that the Agent now handed him.
Shoz-Dijiji could not quite make out what the bits of paper
were&mdash;from a distance they looked like two halves of a playing
card.</p>

<p>Luis mounted his pony and helped the men round up the cattle,
but after they had started them in the direction of the Agency Luis
waved his adios and reined his pony southward toward the Hog
Ranch.</p>

<p>Shoz-Dijiji remained motionless until all were well out of
sight, then he wormed his way below the brow of the hill, rose and
walked down to Nejeunee. He had spent the preceding night in the
hogan of friends on the reservation. They had talked of many
things, among them being the fact that the Agent was still buying
stolen cattle at a low price and collecting a high price for them
from the Government.</p>

<p>Shoz-Dijiji knew that he had seen stolen cattle delivered to the
Agent, which would not, of itself, have given him any concern; but
the fact that most of these cattle had evidently been stolen from
Wichita Billings put an entirely different aspect on the
matter.</p>

<p>The fact that she hated him, that she had offered a reward for
him, dead, could not alter the fact that he loved her; and, loving
her, he must find a way to inform her of what he had discovered.
Naturally, the first means to that end which occurred to him was
Luke Jensen. He would ride back to where Luke Jensen rode and find
him.</p>

<p>It is a long way from where Cheetim and Kreff had hidden the
stolen herd to the Billings east range, and when one is a fair
target for every rifle and six-shooter in the world it behooves one
to move warily; so Shoz-Dijiji lay up until night and then rode
slowly toward the east.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p class="first">Luis Mariel had ridden directly to the Hog Ranch
and reported to Cheetim, handing him both halves of the jack of
spades as evidence that the herd had been turned over to the proper
party in accordance with Luis' instructions.</p>

<p>"That's jest what I been waitin' fer," said Cheetim. "Now I got
some more work fer you, if you're game. They's fifty dollars extra
in it fer you."</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked Luis.</p>

<p>"It aint none o' your business what it is," replied Cheetim.
"All you got to know is thet they may be some shootin' in it, an'
all you got to do is do what I tell you. If you're skeered I don't
want you."</p>

<p>"I am not afraid, se&ntilde;or," replied Luis. The fifty dollars
appeared a fortune.</p>

<p>"All right. You savvy the Crazy B Ranch?"</p>

<p>"Si, se&ntilde;or."</p>

<p>"I want you to take a note to 'Smooth' Kreff, the foreman o'
thet outfit."</p>

<p>"Is that all?"</p>

<p>"No. After you deliver the note you hang around and see what
happens. They's a girl there. When I come I'll want to know where
she is and how many men there are left at the ranch. There'll be
four or five fellers with me. After that I'll tell you what to
do."</p>

<p>"When does the shooting happen?" asked Luis.</p>

<p>"Oh, maybe they won't be no shootin'," replied Cheetim. "I was
jest warnin' you in case they was. I'll write the letter now an'
then you hit the trail. Ef you ride hard you'll make it before sun
up. I want you there before the hands start out fer the day.
Savvy?"</p>

<p>Laboriously, with the stub of a pencil that he constantly wet
with his tongue, "Dirty" Cheetim wrote. It appeared to Luis that
Se&ntilde;or Cheetim was not accustomed to writing&mdash;he seemed
to be suffering from mental constipation&mdash;but at last the
agony was over and Cheetim handed Luis a sheet of soiled paper
folded many times into a small wad.</p>

<p>"If Kreff asks you about the cattle you say that when you went
up this mornin' the bars o' the c'rral was down an' the cattle
gone, an' don't you tell him nothin' different. If you do you won't
get no fifty dollars 'cause you won't need 'em where I'll send
you." Cheetim slapped the six-shooter at his hip.</p>

<p>"I understand," said Luis. He did not like Se&ntilde;or Cheetim,
but fifty dollars are fifty dollars.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>The sun was but a few minutes high when Luis Mariel reined into
the Billings ranch yard. From a slight eminence a mile or two away,
beyond the east pasture fence, Shoz-Dijiji saw him come and
wondered.</p>

<p>The Apache had taken his position just before dawn and at the
first flush of the new day had fixed his field glasses upon the
ranch yard. He wished to get in touch with Jensen as quickly as
possible and saw in this plan the surest method of determining when
and in what direction Luke rode that morning.</p>

<p><br>
Luis went at once to the bunk house, where the men were already
astir, and delivered the letter to Kreff, whom he at once
recognized as the tall, sandy haired man who had taken him to the
herd and given him the torn playing card and his instructions.
Kreff recognized Luis, too, but he only frowned.</p>

<p>Almost as laboriously as Cheetim had written it, Kreff
deciphered the note.</p>

<p>"Frend Kref:" he read. "Sum fellers stole the herd bring al yore
hands &amp; help Me round them up they will think the fellers stol
them &amp; That will let us out doan fetch the greser i think he
wus in on it dirty yours truely."</p>

<p>"Hell!" ejaculated Kreff.</p>

<p>"What's eatin' you?" inquired Kansas.</p>

<p>"'Dirty' Cheetim says a bunch of rustlers is runnin' off some of
our stock. He seen 'em headin' past his place. Luke! Rustle up that
'cavvy,' pronto. You fellers feed while Luke's gone. We're all
hittin' the trail after them lousy thieves."</p>

<p>"I reckon 'Dirty' is jest sore 'cause he didn't git to the bunch
ahead o' them other fellers," drawled "Kansas."</p>

<p>Luke tucked his shirt tails into his trousers, grabbed his
Stetson, and bolted for the corral. When Kreff had finished
dressing he went to the cook house and told the Chinese cook to
hurry breakfast. Then he walked over to the ranch house and
stopping under Wichita's window called her name aloud.</p>

<p>A moment later, a Navajo blanket about her shoulders, the girl
appeared at the window.</p>

<p>"What is it, 'Smooth?'" she asked.</p>

<p>"You was right about the rustling," he said. "Cheetim jest sent
a Greaser with a note sayin' he'd seen some fellers runnin' off a
bunch of our stock. I'm takin' all the men an' ridin' after 'em.
They can't git away."</p>

<p>"Good!" cried the girl. "I'll go with you."</p>

<p>"No, you better not. They's almost sure to be shootin'."</p>

<p>"I can shoot," she replied.</p>

<p>"I know thet; but please don't do it, Chita. We'd all be lookin'
after you an' couldn't do like we would if they wasn't a woman
along."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you are right," she admitted. "Gosh! Why wasn't I born
a boy?"</p>

<p>"I'm shore glad you wasn't."</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>Shoz-Dijiji, seeing Luke riding early and alone straight in his
direction, felt that once again, after long forgetfulness, Usen had
remembered him. He knew that the youth would come only as far as
the horses pastured in the east pasture, and so he rode down and
came through the gate to meet the cowboy. The willows in the draw
screened them from each other's sight until Luke spurred up the
steep bank of the wash and came face to face with the Apache.</p>

<p>"Hello, there!" he exclaimed in surprise. "What you doin'
here?"</p>

<p>"I want you take word to Wichita," said Shoz-Dijiji. "The Indian
Agent is buying cattle that are stolen from her. I saw it
yesterday, on the reservation. You tell her?"</p>

<p>"We jest got word of the same bunch, I reckon," replied Luke.
"We're all ridin' out after 'em now. Which way was they headin'
when you saw them?"</p>

<p>"Toward the Agency."</p>

<p>"Thanks a lot, Shoz-Dijiji," said Luke. "I'll tell her anyway
when I see her about your sendin' the word to her."</p>

<p>"No," said the Apache. "Do not tell her who sent the word."</p>

<p>"All right. I got to be movin'. The boys is waitin' fer these
broncs. So long, Shoz-Dijiji!"</p>

<p>"Adios!" replied the Apache, and as Jensen herded the horses
toward the corrals Shoz-Dijiji rode away, out through the pasture
gate, onto the east range.</p>

<p>Something was troubling Shoz-Dijiji's mind. He had seen Luis
Mariel guarding the stolen herd and yet it was he who brought word
to the ranch concerning these same cattle. What did it mean?</p>

<p>Through his glasses the Apache watched the departure of the
Crazy B cow hands. Apparently all had left the ranch with the
exception of Luis Mariel. Why was Luis remaining? He had seen
Wichita come into the yard and talk with some of the men as they
were mounting, and he had seen her wave them godspeed. She had
spoken to Luis, too, and then gone into the house. Luis was hanging
around the corrals.</p>

<p>Shoz-Dijiji shook his head. Luis was a good boy. He would not
harm anyone. There was something else to think about and that was
breakfast. Shoz-Dijiji rode a short distance to the east,
dismounted and with bow and arrows set forth in search of his
breakfast. In half an hour he had a cottontail and a quail.
Returning to Nejeunee he sought a secluded spot and cooked his
breakfast.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>Ten minutes after Luis Mariel had departed from the Hog Ranch
the previous evening Cheetim with four others had ridden out along
the same trail; and when Kreff and the other men of the Crazy B
rode away in the morning in search of the rustlers, from the hills
south of the ranch these five had watched them depart.</p>

<p>"We got lots of time," said Cheetim, "an' we'll wait until they
are plenty far away before we ride down. You four'll hev to git the
girl. Ef she seen me comin' she'd start shootin' before we was
inside the gate, but she don't know none of you. I was damn sure to
pick fellers she didn't know. You ride in an' ask fer grub an' a
job. The greaser'll be there to tell you ef they is any men left
around an' where the girl is. You won't have no trouble. Jes' grab
her an' don't give her no chance to draw thet gun o' hers, fer I'm
here to state thet ol' man Billings' girl wouldn't think no more o'
perforatin' your ornery hides then she would of spittin'."</p>

<p><br>
The ride ahead of Kreff and his men was, the foreman knew, a long
and hard one. There was some slight chance of borrowing a change of
horses at a ranch near Cheetim's place; but it was only a chance,
and so Kreff conserved his horse flesh and did not push on too
rapidly.</p>

<p>As he rode he had time to think things out a little more clearly
than he had in the excitement and rush of preparation, and he
wondered why it had been that Cheetim had not organized a party to
go after the rustlers and save the cattle for themselves. He could
easily have done it, as there were always several tough gun-men
hanging around his place who would commit murder for a pint of
whiskey. Yes, that did seem peculiar. And if he had mistrusted the
Mexican, why had he entrusted the message to him? Kreff did not
trust Cheetim to any greater extent than a cottontail would trust a
rattler, and now that he had an opportunity to consider the whole
matter carefully he grew suspicious.</p>

<p>Suddenly it occurred to him that he had left Wichita alone on
the ranch with only the Chinese cook, and that the Mexican had
remained behind after they had left. The more he thought about it
the more it worried him. He called Luke to his side.</p>

<p>"Kid," he said, "we left thet Greaser there on the ranch. I
don't guess we should have. You ride back an' look after
things&mdash;an' don't let no grass grow under you while you're
doin' it."</p>

<p>Luke, though disappointed at the thought of missing the
excitement of a brush with the rustlers, reined in, wheeled his
pony, and spurred back toward the ranch.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>Wichita, coming from the office door after breakfast, saw four
strange men ride into the ranch yard. She saw the Mexican youth who
had brought word of the stolen cattle ride up to them, but she
could not hear what they said, nor was it apparent that the Mexican
was acquainted with the newcomers.</p>

<p>The four rode toward her presently, and as they neared her one
of them removed his hat and asked if he could see the boss.</p>

<p>"I'm the boss," she replied.</p>

<p>"We're lookin' fer work," said the man; and as he spoke he
dismounted and walked close to her, the others reining near as
though to hear what her answer would be.</p>

<p>When the man was quite close he suddenly seized her, whirled her
about and held her hands behind her. At the same instant another of
his fellows dismounted and stepped quickly to her. She struggled
and fought to free herself; but she was helpless, and in another
moment they had bound her wrists behind her.</p>

<p>As they were lifting her to one of the horses the Chinese ran
from the cook house, calling to them to stop; but one of the men
drew his six-shooter, and a single, menacing shot was enough to
send the unarmed domestic back into his kitchen.</p>

<p>Cheetim, watching from the hills south of the ranch, saw all
that transpired within the yard and was highly elated at the ease
with which his nefarious plan was being carried out; but, alas,
things were running far too smoothly.</p>

<p>What was that? He bent an attentive ear toward the west and
recognized the cadenced pounding of the hoofs of a rapidly
galloping horse&mdash;the little rift within the lute.</p>

<p>In the ranch yard the men had stopped to argue. Cheetim could
see them but he could not understand the delay. He could only curse
silently, dividing his attention between them and the road to the
west, along which he could hear the approaching hoof beats.</p>

<p>"What's the use of packin' this girl double?" the man who had
been assigned to carry Wichita demanded. "We got plenty time an'
they's a hoss standin' right down there in the c'ral."</p>

<p>"'Dirty' said not to waste no time," demurred another.</p>

<p>The mention of Cheetim's descriptive nick-name was the first
intimation Wichita had received of the origin and purpose of the
plan to abduct her. Now she understood&mdash;it was all clear,
horribly clear. For years the man had hounded and annoyed her.
Twice before he had tried to take her forcibly. It looked now as
though he might succeed. Who was there to succor her? Her father
dead and every man in her employ gone, for how long she could not
guess. There was no one. She wondered why it was that at that
moment the figure of an almost naked, bronze savage filled her
thoughts to the exclusion of every other source of salvation, and
that while she nursed her hatred of him she involuntarily almost
prayed that some miracle might bring him to her.</p>

<p>The man who had suggested a separate horse for Wichita insisted.
"It won't take two minutes," he said, "an' if we are follered we
kin make better time than if one of the hosses is packin'
double."</p>

<p>"Hell, then," exclaimed one of his fellows, "instead of chawin'
the fat let's git a hoss. Here, you!" he addressed Luis. "Fetch
that hoss. Throw a saddle onto him an' a lead rope."</p>

<p>As Luis hastened to obey, Cheetim, seeing the further delay,
became frantic. The horseman was approaching rapidly along the road
from the west, and the men in the ranch yard were wasting valuable
time.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>Out on the east range Shoz-Dijiji, having finished his
breakfast, mounted Nejeunee and turned the pony's head toward the
east, toward the distant mountains where the Gila rises, toward the
ancient stamping grounds of the Be-don-ko-he.</p>

<p>He had no plans for the future. He wanted only to get away. He
had seen Wichita Billings through his field glasses, and the sight
of her had but aggravated the old hurt. Sad and lonely, the war
chief rode toward the deserted camp grounds of his vanished people,
where now were only brooding memories.</p>

<p><br>
Luke Jensen galloped into sight of the ranch. Cheetim, lying behind
a boulder at the top of a hill, covered him with his rifle sights
and fired. Luke heard the bullet scream past his ear. Forewarned of
some danger, he knew not what, he was prepared. He took two flying
shots at the puff of smoke at the hill top where his unknown
assailant lay, dug the rowels into his pony's sides, and raced for
the ranch gate that he saw was standing open.</p>

<p>Cheetim fired once more; but again he missed, and then Luke was
inside the yard. Coming toward him from the corrals he saw five men
and Wichita, and he knew that something was radically wrong even
before one of the men drew his gun and opened fire on him. Unable
to return the man's fire without endangering Wichita, Jensen
spurred in the direction of an out-building that would give him
shelter until he could get his rifle into action.</p>

<p>The five men spurred toward the gate, quirting Wichita's horse
to equal speed. Three of them were firing at Luke; and just as he
reached the out-building, just when he was within a second of
safety, Wichita saw him lunge from his saddle, hit.</p>

<p>Then her captors raced through the gate and into the hills south
of the ranch, whirling Wichita Billings away with them.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="chap18" id="chap18">XVIII. &mdash; THE APACHE
DEVIL!</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">OUT on the east range a horseman reined in his
mount and listened as the rapid reports of rifle and pistol came
faintly to his ears. There was something amiss at the Crazy B Ranch
and Wichita was there, practically alone! Shoz-Dijiji wheeled
Nejeunee so suddenly that the little pinto reared almost straight
in air and then, at a touch of his master's heels and a word in his
pointed ears, leaped off in the new direction at a swift run.</p>

<p><br>
After sending Luke back to the ranch, Kreff's suspicions, now
thoroughly aroused, continued to increase. He began to realize that
if they were well founded one man might not be sufficient. He
wished that he had sent more. Presently he wished that he had gone
himself; and soon he reined in, halting his companions.</p>

<p>"Fellers," he said, "the more I think about it the more I think
that mebby Cheetim's givin' us a dirty deal. He may have jest
wanted to git us all away from the ranch. He's tried to get Chita
twice before, I'm a-goin' back an' I'm a-goin' to take Jake an' Sam
with me. 'Kansas,' you take Charlie an' Matt an' ride after them
rustlers. Ef you kin pick up some fellers along the way, all right;
ef you can't, do the best you kin alone. So long! Come on,
fellers!"</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p class="first">As the five men entered the hills with Chita,
Cheetim joined them. It was evident that he was much elated.</p>

<p>"Good work, boys!" he cried. "I reckon I didn't pull the wool
over 'Smooth's' eyes nor nothin', eh?" He rode to Chita's side and
grinned into her face. "Say, dearie," he exclaimed, "you don't hev
to worry none. I've decided to do the right thing by you. We'll
spend our honeymoon up in the hills 'til things blows over a bit
an' then we'll mosey down to the Hog Ranch an' git married."</p>

<p>Wichita looked the man straight in the eyes for a moment and
then turned away in disgust, but she did not speak. Luis Mariel,
sober eyed, serious, looked on. He had not bargained on a part in
any such affair as this.</p>

<p>"Well, fellers," said Cheetim, "let's pull up a second an'
licker. I reckon we've earned a drink."</p>

<p>They stopped their ponies and from five hip pockets came five
pint bottles.</p>

<p>"Here's to the bride!" cried Cheetim, and they all laughed and
drank, all except Luis, who had no bottle.</p>

<p>"Here, kid," said Cheetim, "hev a drink!" He proffered his flask
to Luis.</p>

<p>"Thank you, se&ntilde;or, I do not care to drink," replied the
Mexican.</p>

<p>Deep into the hills they rode&mdash;five miles, ten miles.
Wichita guessed where they were taking her&mdash;to an old two room
shack that prospectors had built years before beside a little
spring far back in the mountains. Apaches had gotten the
prospectors, and the shack had stood deserted and tenantless ever
since.</p>

<p>She felt quite hopeless, for there seemed not the slightest
foundation for belief that there could be any help for her. Luke,
if he were not badly hurt, or possibly Chung, the cook, could get
word to their nearest neighbor; but he lived miles and miles away;
and any help to be effective must reach her within a few hours, for
after that it would be too late. And even if men were found to come
after her it might be a long time before they could locate
Cheetim's hiding place.</p>

<p>Cheetim and his men had finished a flask apiece as they rode,
but this was not the extent of their supply&mdash;each had another
flask in his shirt&mdash;so that by the time they reached the shack
they were more than content with themselves and all the world.</p>

<p>Once Luis had ridden close beside Wichita and spoken to her. "I
am sorry, se&ntilde;orita," he whispered. "I did not know what they
were going to do. If I can help you, I will. Maybe, when they are
drunk, I can help you get away."</p>

<p>"Thanks," replied the girl. As she spoke she turned and looked
at the youth, noticing him more than casually for the first time,
and realized that his face seemed familiar. "Where have I seen you
before?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I brought the pinto pony from El Teniente King to your rancho a
year ago," replied Luis.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I remember you now. You brought Shoz-Dijiji's pony up
from Mexico."</p>

<p>"Shoz-Dijiji's pony? Was that Shoz-Dijiji's pony? You know
Shoz-Dijiji, se&ntilde;orita?"</p>

<p>"I know him," said the girl; "do you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, very well. He saved my father's life; and twice when he
could have killed me he did not."</p>

<p>Their conversation was interrupted by Cheetim who rode back to
Wichita's side.</p>

<p>"Well, here we are, dearie," he said, "but we aint goin' to stay
here long. Tomorrow morning we hit the trail fer a place I know
where God himself couldn't find us."</p>

<p>The shack, before which the party had stopped and were
dismounting, was a rough affair built of stone and mud and such
timber as grew sparsely on the slopes of the canyon in the bottom
of which it nestled. A tiny spring, now choked with dirt, made a
mud hole a few yards to one side of the building. The men led their
horses to the rear of the building where there were a few trees to
which they could fasten them. Two of the men started to clean out
the spring, and Cheetim escorted Wichita into the shack.</p>

<p>"We brung along some grub," he said. "It won't be much of a
weddin' breakfast to brag on, but you wait 'til we git back to the
Hog Ranch! We'll have a reg'lar spread then an' invite every
son-of-a-gun in the territory. I'm goin' to treat you right, kid,
even if you haven't been any too damn nice to me."</p>

<p>Wichita did not speak.</p>

<p>"Say, you can jest start right now cuttin' out thet high toned
stuff with me," said Cheetim. "I'll be good to you ef you treat me
right, but by God I aint a-goin' to stand much more funny business.
You kin start now by givin' me a little kiss."</p>

<p>"Cheetim," said the girl, "listen to me. You're half drunk now,
but maybe you've got sense enough left to understand what I am
going to say to you. I'd a heap rather kiss a Gila monster than
you. You may be able to kiss me because you're stronger than I am,
and I guess even kissing a Gila monster wouldn't kill me, but I'm
warning you that ef you ever do kiss me you'd better kill me quick,
for I'm going to kill myself if anything happens to me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ef you want to be a damn fool that's your own look out,"
interrupted Cheetim, with a snarl, "but it won't keep me from doin'
what I'm goin' to do. Ef you're fool enough to kill yourself
afterward, you can."</p>

<p>"You didn't let me finish," said Wichita. "I'll kill myself, all
right, but I'll kill you first."</p>

<p>The men were entering the room; and Cheetim stood, hesitating,
knowing the girl meant what she said. He was a coward, and he had
not had quite enough whiskey to bolster up his courage to the point
of his desires.</p>

<p>"Oh, well," he said, "we won't quarrel this a-way on our
honeymoon. You jest go in the other room there, dearie, and make
yourself to home; an' we'll talk things over later. Git me a piece
of rope, one o' you fellers. I ain't goin' to take no chances of my
bride vamoosin'."</p>

<p>In the small back room of the shack they tied Wichita's wrists
and ankles securely and left her seated on an old bench, the only
furniture that the room boasted.</p>

<p>Out in the front room the men were making preparations to cook
some of the food they had brought with them, but most of their time
was devoted to drinking and boasting. Cheetim drank with a purpose.
He wanted to arrive, as quickly as possible, at a state of
synthetic courage that would permit him to ignore the moral
supremacy of the girl in the back room. He knew that he was
physically more powerful, and so he could not understand why he
feared her. Cheetim had never heard of such a thing as an
inferiority complex, and so he did not know that that was what he
suffered from in an aggravated form whenever he faced the level
gaze and caustic tongue of Wichita Billings.</p>

<p>The more Cheetim drank the louder and more boastful he became.
Wichita could hear him narrating the revolting details of numerous
crimes that he had committed.</p>

<p>"Yo shua ah some bad hombre, 'Dirty'," eulogized one of his
party.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't claim to be no bad man," replied Cheetim, modestly.
"What I says is thet I has brains, an' I use 'em. Look how I fooled
'Smooth'&mdash;sent him off on a wild goose chase an' then swipes
his girl while he's gone." They all laughed uproariously.</p>

<p>"An' he better not get funny about it neither, even ef he don't
like it. I kin use my brains fer other things besides gettin' me my
women. Ol' man Billings larnt thet. He kicked me out oncet; an' I
suppose he thought I was afraid of him, but I was jest waitin'. I
waited a long time, but I got him."</p>

<p>"You got him? You did not. He was kilt by Injuns," contradicted
one.</p>

<p>"Injuns, Hell!" ejaculated Cheetim. "Thar's where I used my
brains. I killed Billings, but I was cute enough to scalp him.
I&mdash;"</p>

<p>Drunk as he was, he realized that he had gone too far, had
admitted too much. He looked wickedly about the room.</p>

<p>"What I've told you is among friends," he said. "Ef any of you
fellers ever feels like you'd like to join Billings all you got to
do is blab what I jest told you. Savvy?"</p>

<p>In the other room Wichita Billings, listening, heard every word
that Cheetim spoke, and her soul was seared by shame and vain
regret for the wrong she had done the friendless red man. She
reproached herself for not listening to the counsel and the urging
of her heart, for she knew&mdash;she had always known&mdash;that
she had battled against her love for Shoz-Dijiji, had trampled it
beneath her feet, that she might encourage her belief in his
perfidy.</p>

<p>If she could only see him once more, if she could only tell him
that she knew and ask his forgiveness; but now it was too late.</p>

<p>She heard Cheetim speaking again. "You fellers finish rustlin'
the grub," he said. "I'm goin' in an' visit my wife." This sally
was applauded with much laughter. "An' I don't want to be
disturbed," he concluded, "Savvy?"</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p class="first">A pinto stallion, racing like the wind, bore its
rider toward the Crazy B ranch house following the shots that had
attracted the attention of the Apache. Fences intervened, but
though there were gates in, them Shoz-Dijiji had no time to waste
on gates. Straight for them he rode Nejeunee; and the pinto took
them in his stride, soaring over them like a bird on the wing.</p>

<p>Chung, kneeling beside Luke in the ranch yard, voiced a startled
cry as he saw a pinto stallion, bearing a feared Apache warrior,
rise over the bars of the corral; but Chung did not flee. He stood
his post, though scarce knowing what to do.</p>

<p>Luke's six-shooter was close beside his hand; but Chung was too
surprised to think of it, and a second later the warrior had reined
in beside them, his pony sliding upon its haunches for a dozen
feet.</p>

<p>Throwing himself to the ground Shoz-Dijiji knelt beside
Luke.</p>

<p>"What has happened?" he demanded. "Where is Chita?"</p>

<p>Luke looked up. "Oh, it's you, Shoz-Dijiji? Thank God for that.
A bunch of skunks jest rid off into the south hills with her. I
ain't hurted bad, but I cain't ride. You go!"</p>

<p>"Sure I go!" As he arose Shoz-Dijiji stripped his clothing from
him in an instant, and when he leaped to Nejeunee's back again he
wore only moccasins, his G-string, and a head band.</p>

<p>"I get help" he cried, reassuringly, waving his rifle above his
head, and an instant later he was racing for the gate.</p>
<a id="pic5" name="pic5"><!--Image Anchor--></a><br>

<div align="center"><img src="0300271h-images/ApacheDevil-05.jpg"
alt="Illustration" title="Illustration">
<p class="caption">"I get help" he cried, reassuringly, waving his
rifle above his head.</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>Down the road from the west thundered Kreff and Jake and Sam
just as Shoz-Dijiji swept through the gate. "There's the Siwash
killed the Boss!" shouted Sam, who was in the lead, and the words
were scarce out of his mouth before he had drawn his gun and opened
fire on the Indian. Jake joined in the fusillade of shots; and
Shoz-Dijiji, turning upon the back of his war pony, sent a half
dozen bullets among them before he vanished into the hills. It was
only the rapidity with which their mounts had been moving that
prevented any casualties.</p>

<p>"Even a coyote will fight for his life," soliloquized the Apache
Devil; but he did not feel like a coyote. Once more he was an
Apache war chief riding naked upon the war trail against the hated
pindah-lickoyee; and just as he rode from the sight of the white
men he could not restrain a single, exultant Apache war whoop.</p>

<p>Into the ranch yard thundered Kreff and his companions. They saw
Luke trying to drag himself to his feet and stagger toward him.</p>

<p>"You lop-eared idiots!" he yelled. "Wot in Hell you shootin' at
him fer? He's ridin' after the fellers that stole Chita."</p>

<p>"Stole Chita?" cried Kreff. "I was right! Cheetim!"</p>

<p>"I didn't see Cheetim," said Luke. "Whoever it was rid south
into the hills. Git the hell out of here and git after them, an' ef
you see that Apache leave him be&mdash;he's the best friend Wichita
Billings's got."</p>

<p>"Chung, you git Luke into the bunk house an' take keer o' him
'til we gets back," Kreff called over his shoulder as the three
spurred away again, this time following the trail taken by
Shoz-Dijiji.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>Plain before the trained eyes of Shoz-Dijiji lay the spoor of
his quarry. Swiftly he rode. The errand, the speed of his fleet
pony, his own nakedness stirred every savage instinct within him.
He had never expected to live again; but this, O, Usen, was life!
He dipped into the pouch at his side and drew out a little silver
box that he had never expected to use again, and dipping into it
with a forefinger he banded his face with the blue and white war
paint of the Apache Devil. He could not lay the colors on carefully
at the speed Nejeunee was carrying him; but he wore them, as a ship
of war runs up its battle flag as it goes into action.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p class="first">As Cheetim left them and entered the rear room of
the shack, the men in the front room nudged one another, chuckled,
and took a drink. They were wiping their mouths with the backs of
their hands when the outer door swung open, and a painted warrior
stepped into the room.</p>

<p>Luis Mariel, who was standing in a corner, looked wide eyed at
the newcomer. The other men reached for their six-shooters. "The
Apache Devil!" cried Luis. Shoz-Dijiji looked quickly at him. "Lie
down!" he said to him in Spanish. Already he had commenced to
shoot. He asked no questions. A man fell.</p>

<p>In the back room Cheetim and Wichita heard the dread name as
Luis cried it aloud. Cheetim had just entered and closed the door
behind him. He was approaching Wichita as Luis spoke the name of
the scourge of three states. At the first shot Cheetim crossed the
room at a bound and leaped from the window. A half dozen shots
followed in quick succession. Four men lay dead in the outer room
when Shoz-Dijiji sprang to the door of the smaller room and swung
it open, just in time to see Cheetim mounting a horse in the rear
of the building. He recognized him instantly; then he turned toward
the girl.</p>

<p>"You hurt?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"No. Oh, Shoz-Dijiji, thank God, you came!"</p>

<p>The Apache called to Luis who came running to the door.</p>

<p>"You," he said, pointing at the youth. "You know the Apache
Devil. You know what he do to his enemies. You take this girl home.
If she don't get home safe the Apache Devil settle with you.
Sabe?"</p>

<p>He crossed the room to the window.</p>

<p>"Where are you going?" cried Wichita.</p>

<p>"To kill my last pindah-lickoyee," replied Shoz-Dijiji, as he
vaulted across the sill.</p>

<p>"Wait! Wait, Shoz-Dijiji," the girl called after him; but
Shoz-Dijiji, war chief of the Be-don-ko-he, war chief of all the
Apaches, had gone.</p>

<p>The little pinto stallion was scrambling up the steep canyon
side as Luis Mariel cut the bonds that held Wichita Billings. The
girl ran to the window.</p>

<p>Far above she saw war pony and warrior silhouetted against the
darkening sky; and then Shoz-Dijiji, last of the war chiefs, and
Nejeunee, last of his wild friends, dropped below the crest and
disappeared.</p>

<p>For several minutes the girl stood at the window gazing out into
the gathering night; then she turned back into the room where Luis
stood just within the doorway.</p>

<p>"The Apache Devil!" There was a shudder in Wichita's voice. Her
eyes discovered Luis. "Oh," she said, as though she had forgotten
his presence, "you are here?"</p>

<p>"Si, se&ntilde;orita."</p>

<p>Again there was a long silence.</p>

<p>"The Apache Devil!" Wichita squared her shoulders and lifted her
chin. "I do not care," she cried, defiantly.</p>

<p>"No, se&ntilde;orita."</p>

<p>The girl looked fixedly at the Mexican youth for a moment as
though his presence suggested a new thought that was formulating in
her mind.</p>

<p>"What is your name?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Luis, se&ntilde;orita," he replied; "Luis Mariel."</p>

<p>"You said that you would help me, Luis, if you could. Do you
remember?"</p>

<p>"I remember, se&ntilde;orita."</p>

<p>"You can, Luis. Ride after the&mdash;the Apache Devil and tell
him that I want him to come back."</p>

<p>"Gladly, se&ntilde;orita."</p>

<p>"Go," she urged. "Hurry! Go now!"</p>

<p>Luis glanced behind him through the doorway into the other room
and then back at Wichita.</p>

<p>"And leave you alone, at night, with all these dead men?" he
exclaimed. "Santa Maria, se&ntilde;orita! No, I cannot do
that."</p>

<p>"I am not afraid, Luis," she said.</p>

<p>"S-s-st!" exclaimed Luis in a hoarse whisper. "What is
that?"</p>

<p>They both listened.</p>

<p>"Someone is coming," said the girl. "Perhaps&mdash;perhaps it is
he."</p>

<p>"There is more than one," said the youth. "I hear them talking
now." He stepped quickly into the adjoining room and, stooping,
took a six-shooter from the floor where it lay beside one of the
dead men. Returning, he handed it to Wichita Billings. "Perhaps
these are more of Se&ntilde;or Cheetim's friends," he
suggested.</p>

<p>Together they stood waiting. The sounds of approaching horses
ceased, and all was quiet. Wichita knew that whoever it was that
came had reached a point where the shack was visible for the first
time and were doubtless reconnoitering. Finally a voice broke the
silence.</p>

<p>"Chita!" it called aloud, ringing and echoing through the
canyon.</p>

<p>"They are my friends," she said to Luis and ran through the
outer room to the front doorway.</p>

<p>"Here, 'Smooth'!" she called. "It is all right. I am in the
shack."</p>

<p>Luis came and stood just behind her shoulder. It was not yet so
dark but that features might be recognized at short distances. The
two saw Kreff riding forward with Sam and Jake. Luis laid a hand on
Wichita's arm.</p>

<p>"They are Cheetim's friends," he said. "I know that first one
well." He brushed by her, his revolver in his hand.</p>

<p>"No!" she cried, seizing his arm. "They are my own men. The
first one is my foreman."</p>

<p>"Here's one of 'em, boys!" cried Kreff as he recognized Luis.
"Here's the damned Greaser that brought me thet lyin' letter from
'Dirty.' Git out o' the way, Chita!" and leaping from his horse he
ran forward.</p>

<p>"Stop!" cried Luis. His weapon was levelled at Kreff's
stomach.</p>

<p>"This boy is all right!" exclaimed Wichita. "Put your guns away,
all of you."</p>

<p>Slowly and with no great alacrity Kreff and Mariel returned
their revolvers to their holsters. The other two men followed their
example.</p>

<p>"What's happened here?" demanded Kreff. "Has anyone hurted you,
Chita?"</p>

<p>"No, I'm all right," she replied. "I'll tell you all about it
later. Get your horse, Luis, and take the message that I gave you.
I'll be starting back for the ranch now. I'll be waiting there.
Tell him that I shall be waiting there for him."</p>

<p>Kreff looked on, puzzled, as Wichita gave her instructions to
Luis. He saw the youth mount and ride up the canyon side. Then he
turned to the girl.</p>

<p>"Where's he goin'?" he demanded. "Who you goin' to wait
fer?"</p>

<p>"For Shoz-Dijiji," she replied. "He did not kill Dad&mdash;it
was Cheetim. Come along, now; I want to go home."</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="chap19" id="chap19">XIX. &mdash; THE LAST WAR
TRAIL</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">THROUGH the descending dark an Apache rode along
the war trail, following the tracks of an enemy. He saw that the
man ahead of him had been urging his mount at perilous speed down
the rocky gorge, but the Apache did not hurry. He was a young man.
Before him stretched a life time in which to bring the quarry to
bay. To follow recklessly would be to put himself at a
disadvantage, to court disaster, defeat, death. Such was not the
way of an Apache. Doggedly, stealthily he would stalk the foe. If
it took a life time, if he must follow, him across a world, what
matter? In the end he would get him.</p>

<p>What was that, just ahead? In the trail, looming strange through
the dusk, lay something that did not harmonize with the
surroundings. At first he could not be quite certain what it was,
but that it did not belong there was apparent to his trained
senses.</p>

<p>Cautiously he approached. It was a horse lying in the trail. It
was alive. It tried to rise as he came nearer, but it stumbled and
fell again&mdash;and it groaned. He saw that it was saddled and
bridled. He waited in concealment, listening. There was no other
sound. Creeping nearer he saw that the horse could not rise because
one of its legs was broken. It suffered. Shoz-Dijiji drew his
butcher knife and cut its throat, putting it out of its misery.
Cheetim had ridden too fast down this rocky gorge. On foot now,
leading Nejeunee, Shoz-Dijiji followed the faint spoor of the
dismounted man. He found the place where it turned up the
precipitous side of the gorge where no horse could go, and here
Shoz-Dijiji abandoned Nejeunee and followed on alone.</p>

<p>All night he followed. At dawn he knew that he was close upon
the man he sought. Small particles of earth were still crumbling
back into the depression of a footprint where Cheetim had stepped
but a few moments before. Did Shoz-Dijiji hasten forward? No. On
the contrary he followed more cautiously, more slowly than before,
for he gave the enemy credit for doing precisely what Shoz-Dijiji
would have done had their positions been reversed&mdash;except that
Shoz-Dijiji would have done it hours earlier. With infinite
patience and care he crept up each slope and from the summit
surveyed the terrain ahead before he proceeded. He knew that
Cheetim was just ahead of him and that he would soon stop to rest,
for the spoor told him that the man was almost exhausted. For a
long time Shoz-Dijiji had guessed that the other knew he was being
followed&mdash;before that he had only feared it. The end must be
near.</p>

<p>Shoz-Dijiji crept slowly up a hillside. Just below the summit he
stopped and took a red bandanna from his pouch. This he wrapped
loosely about the stock of his rifle; and then, holding the piece
by the muzzle, raised it slowly just above the hill top. Instantly
there came the report of a rifle from beyond the hill; and
Shoz-Dijiji; almost smiling, jerked the bandanna from sight.</p>

<p>Quickly he hastened to the right, keeping well below the line of
vision of his adversary; and when he crept upward again it was
behind a low bush, through the branches of which he could see
without being seen.</p>

<p>A hundred yards away Cheetim lay behind a boulder upon another
hill top. He was peering out from behind his shelter. Shoz-Dijiji
took careful aim&mdash;not at the head of his enemy, which was in
plain sight, but at his shoulder. Shoz-Dijiji had plans.</p>

<p>He pressed his trigger, and with the report Cheetim jumped
convulsively and slumped forward. Slowly the Apache arose and
keeping his man covered with his rifle walked toward him. He found
the white man, just as he had expected, stunned by the shock of the
wound but not dead.</p>

<p>Shoz-Dijiji removed Cheetim's weapons from his reach and sat
down and waited. With the patience that is an Apache's he waited.
Presently Cheetim opened his eyes and looked into the painted face
of the Apache Devil. He shuddered and closed them again, but
Shoz-Dijiji knew that the man was conscious.</p>

<p>The Indian spoke no word as he bent and seized Cheetim by the
hair. Again the man opened his eyes. He saw the butcher knife in
the hand of the Indian and screamed.</p>

<p>"Fer God's sake don't!" he cried. "I'll give you whiskey,
money&mdash;anything you want ef you'll let me go."</p>

<p>Shoz-Dijiji did not answer him. The keen blade sank into the
flesh of the white man. Cheetim screamed and struggled. There was a
quick, deft, circular motion of Shoz-Dijiji's hand, and a bloody
scalp-lock dangled from the fingers of the war chief. It was then
that Cheetim fainted.</p>

<p>Shoz-Dijiji sat down and waited. Five, ten, fifteen minutes he
waited before Cheetim gave signs of returning consciousness. Still
Shoz-Dijiji waited. At last the white man was fully cognizant of
his surroundings. He began to weep tears of self pity. Shoz-Dijiji
arose and bent over him.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?" shrieked his victim, but the Apache
did not answer him&mdash;in words. Instead he took some buckskin
thongs from his pouch and making a running noose in one end of each
he slipped one upon each wrist and ankle of the prostrate man. Then
with his butcher knife he cut some stakes from stout shrubs that
grew about them. Returning to Cheetim he turned the man upon his
back and, stretching each arm and leg to its full extent, out
spread, he staked the screaming coward to the ground.</p>

<p>Rising, he stood looking down at Cheetim for a long minute.
Then, in silence, he turned and walked away, back along the trail
he had come.</p>

<p>"Don't leave me!" screamed Cheetim. "Fer God's sake come back!
Come back and kill me. Don't leave me here to die alone&mdash;like
this!"</p>

<p>Shoz-Dijiji, war chief of the Be-don-ko-he, walked on in
silence. Not once did he turn to look back in the direction of the
first enemy he had ever tortured. Had he, he would have seen a
vulture circling high against the blue on stationary wings above
the last victim of the Apache Devil.</p>

<p>Where he had left Nejeunee Shoz-Dijiji found Luis Mariel waiting
for him.</p>

<p>"I knew that you would come back to your pony," said Luis.</p>

<p>"Why did you follow me?" demanded the Apache.</p>

<p>"The se&ntilde;orita sent me after you."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"She wished me to say to you that you are to come back to
her."</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p class="first">It was dark when Luis Mariel and Shoz-Dijiji rode
into the ranch yard of the Crazy B. Wichita Billings was standing
beneath the cottonwood trees that grew in front of the ranch house
as they rode up to her and dismounted.</p>

<p>"Luis," she said, "take his horse and yours and turn them into
the east pasture; then go to the cook house. Chung will give you
supper."</p>

<p>Shoz-Dijiji said nothing. He watched Luis leading Nejeunee away.
He waited. Wichita came close to him and laid her hands upon his
breast as she had once before, long ago. Again came the terrible
urge to take her in his arms, but this time he did not surrender to
it.</p>

<p>"You sent for me?" he asked.</p>

<p>"To ask you to forgive me."</p>

<p>"For what?"</p>

<p>"For everything," she replied.</p>

<p>"There is nothing to forgive. You did not understand&mdash;that
is all."</p>

<p>"I understand now."</p>

<p>"I am glad," he said simply. "Is that all?"</p>

<p>"No. Kreff has left. I do not know why. He wouldn't even stop
for supper. Just got his stuff and his check and rode away. I need
another foreman. Will you take the job?"</p>

<p>"Do you want me?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then I will take it. Now I go to the bunk house."</p>

<p>"Wait."</p>

<p>"Is there something more?"</p>

<p>"Yes. You know there is. Oh! Shoz-Dijiji, are you a man or a
stone?" she cried.</p>

<p>"I am an Apache, se&ntilde;orita," he said. "Do not forget that.
I am an Apache, and you are a white girl."</p>

<p>"I do not care. I love you!" She came very close to him
again.</p>

<p>"Are you very sure, Chita?" he asked. "You must make no mistake
this time."</p>

<p>"I am very sure, Shoz-Dijiji."</p>

<p>"We shall see," he said, "for we must both be sure. Shoz-Dijiji
will be very happy if he finds that you can love him even though he
is an Indian&mdash;then he will tell you something that you will be
glad to know, but not now."</p>

<p>"There is something that you could tell me now that I should
like to hear, Shoz-Dijiji," she whispered.</p>

<p>"What is that?"</p>

<p>"You have not told me that you love me."</p>

<p>The war chief took his mate into his arms and looked down into
her tear filled eyes.</p>

<p>"Shoz-Dijiji no sabe," he said, smiling. Then he bent and
covered her lips with his.</p>

<p>In the east pasture a filly nickered, and a pinto stallion
arched his neck and answered her.</p>
