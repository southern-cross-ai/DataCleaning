THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS [Legend: provinces of Luzon.]</p>

<hr>
<a name="ch-01" id="ch-01"></a>
<h2>Chapter I &mdash; THE POINT OF VIEW</h2>

<p>Will you spare a moment to hear, before starting in on the meat
of this book, why and how it is written?</p>

<p>For some few years past we, the American people, have been
vaguely aware of a sensation of unrest in the region of the
Philippine Islands&mdash;and of Voices, once and again, asking for
Philippine Independence.</p>

<p>We have not known what those voices stood for. We have had no
background upon which to rate their claim. And yet the Philippine
Islands are America&#39;s responsibility&mdash;a responsibility
that we voluntarily assumed and may not lightly shift to other
shoulders merely for the asking.</p>

<p>But the Philippine Islands are a long way off. The mere journey
takes more time than most of us can consecutively spare to public
uses.</p>

<p>And so, being myself free to go, and having some previous
experience in field investigation, I determined to make an attempt
to serve my fellow countrymen by collecting for their use the
material that their own obligations preclude their collecting for
themselves.</p>

<p>Arrived in Manila, that delightful town, I addressed myself at
once to the principal Filipino personages. I was received with the
utmost courtesy and cordiality and for weeks enjoyed social
intercourse and many conferences with the chief figures in Filipino
upper life. The limit of my entertainments was the limit that I
myself imposed. I found the people interesting, intelligent,
charming, appealing. And to each with whom I deliberately talked, I
made this careful preliminary statement:</p>

<p>&quot;Your emissaries in Washington are asking for the
independence of these Islands. The question is one that the people
of America must decide&mdash;a grave question, of grave
responsibility. And we know so little about your Islands that our
actual knowledge is almost nothing at all. The best thing would be
for us all to come and see. But that very few of us can do. And it
is this that brings me here now.</p>

<p>&quot;I want to report you and your country to my own people.
Whatever you say and whatever my eyes see, I will do my best
faithfully to convey to them without any colour or favour. And if
you desire it, in reporting you I will withhold your name, although
to do so weakens testimony.</p>

<p>&quot;I intend, to the best of my ability, to see all elements
in your body social&mdash;your friends and your opponents, the
learned and the unlearned, the rich and the poor, not here in
Manila alone, but as far as may be, all over these Islands. And I
shall try to get at every one&#39;s views and learn all that I can
concerning them, everywhere alike and fairly.</p>

<p>&quot;Then I will write it in a book. And my own people, I hope,
will see and trust the purpose behind the book and will feel that
they get, from the result, something on which to start the working
of their minds.</p>

<p>&quot;Finally, I want you to know that I come here as ignorant
concerning you as the most uninformed person now in America; that I
have no pre-possessions, no friendships, no alliances that can in
any way influence my judgment; that I come wholly without
connections with any cause or organization, without commitment to
any publication or party, and entirely at my own expense, as a
volunteer, whose one hope is to do a bit of work that will serve
both sides of the water. For the question is one question&mdash;a
question of light on duty, toward the common good.&quot;</p>

<p>I hope they wholly understood and believed me. I know they were
exceedingly kind, offering their services in every way to help my
study. In particular, one influential and intelligent lady, Mrs.
Jaime de Veyra, was ready to put aside all her personal affairs to
accompany me over the Islands, wherever I might elect to go, to act
as interpreter and guide.</p>

<p>But, delightful and useful as under other circumstances the plan
would have been, I could accept no medium through which to get my
facts, whose whole value must rest on their first-hand quality. In
accordance with which principle I made it a rule, throughout, to
see all witnesses privately, and to choose my own roads and times
and places, independent of any guidance.</p>

<p>I used no Government conveyances, and received no Governmental
favours, excepting in the granting of access to statistics and
records, and in credentials to Filipino Governors of distant
Provinces&mdash;the proper right, on demand, of any reputable
American citizen.</p>

<p>And I have done my best.</p>

<p>That means, alas, that although those who until now have had no
spokesman, neither any way of reaching the public ear, will be
pleased with the result, others will be outraged and hurt. And
although these last are far fewer than the first, I have so warm a
feeling for them almost all that I heartily regret the necessity of
wounding a single one.</p>

<hr class="short">

<p>This book, then, is written for the American citizen who knows,
of the Philippine Islands, that they lie somewhere in the Pacific
Ocean; that Admiral Dewey took them for us in the Spanish War; that
some people think them an object of interest to a hungry Japan;
and&mdash;at a stretch&mdash;that they produce cheap cigars and
&quot;Manila rope.&quot;</p>

<p>Such a foundation will bear, perhaps, the support of another
fact or two to carry to-day&#39;s picture. For example:</p>

<p>There are in the lot 3,141 islands and islets, of which only
about two-thirds are inhabited. Taken altogether, their area about
equals Arizona&#39;s. One of them, Luzon, is as big as Ohio;
another, Mindanao, is as big as Indiana. Of the rest 2,775 measure
less than one square mile apiece. They lie in a half-moon, hugging
the east coast of Asia. Their latitude is about that of the stretch
from the City of Mexico to southern Panama. Their climate varies.
In the high mountains of Luzon oaks and pines grow among
tree-ferns, and films of ice may form of nights on standing water;
while in Mindanao, even as the glorious sea-breeze blows, a white
man&#39;s skin starts dripping, night or day, whenever he stirs.
Periods of heavy rainfall, alternating with dry periods, form their
general changes; to which may be added typhoons in season. Some
islands&mdash;some localities&mdash;are fever holes that eat you
alive, and some again are fairly healthful&mdash;with which
difference the presence or absence of Uncle Sam has much to do. The
majority are beautiful in one way or another, with volcanic peaks
or forest stretches, lakes, open plains, or mountain ranges. And
they produce sugar, hemp, copra, timber, tobacco, rubber, and a few
things more.</p>

<p>According to the Wood-Forbes Report estimate, the foreign
population of the Archipelago comprised, in 1919, 55,212 Chinese,
12,636 Japanese, 6,931 Americans, 1,202 British, 4,271 Spaniards
and 2,893 other nationals&mdash;as Swiss, German, French,
etc.&mdash;altogether 83,145. The Reports&#39; estimate of the
native population, at the same date, was 10,956,730.</p>

<p>The foreigners in the Islands, in the year 1920 <i>(The United
States and the Philippines,</i> D. R. Williams), comprised less
than one per cent of the population and rendered 5,852 income tax
returns, as against 3,667 returns rendered by the Filipinos,

<hr class="short">

<p>The Philippine Islands, to-day, are United States territory.
Whether, or not, or how long, they shall remain so, is a question
to be determined by the people of the United States. As to points
of view from which this question may be regarded, at least three
exist.</p>

<p>1. The strategic point. Here some ask attention to the
geographic fact that the Philippines, if added to the Japanese
island chain, absolutely bar off, like a line of fortresses, the
whole east coast of Asia. And these further affirm that the
islands, as affording the only harbours left available to us in
those seas, are necessary to an effective American Navy and
Merchant Marine. Others again protest, and with equal vigour, that
in our hands the Philippines form a strategic weakness in our lines
of defence.</p>

<p>2. The commercial point. Here it will be shown that the
Philippine Islands, properly developed, would give us among other
tropical products such as sugar, tobacco and hemp, all the rubber
we shall ever need, thus delivering the people of the United States
from the hands of foreign rubber monopolies. This is probably true
beyond debate. It will further be urged that American and other
business men who have worked hard in the islands during the last
quarter century, and who, with small gains to themselves, have
substantially advanced the Islands&#39; fortunes, should be
considered in any plan determining the Islands&#39; fate. Against
this it will be warmly contended that foreigners settling in the
Philippines did so at their own risks, unsolicited, and have no
moral rights in council.</p>

<p>3. The human point. The point from which, regardless of
international or military or commercial interests of the United
States, regardless of the protection or deserts of any foreign
element in the place, attention is focussed exclusively on the
nature and condition of the native people of the Philippine
Islands.</p>

<p>From the third point, and from it only, this book looks.</p>

<p>Now, the initial thing to make clear is this:</p>

<p>What do you mean when you speak of the people of the Philippine
Islands?</p>

<p>Do you think of them as a political body? A social body? A
distinct race? Do you think of them as a minor nation, represented
by delegates to Washington?</p>

<p>If you do, you start wrong.</p>

<p>The pre-eminent native scholar of the Islands, Dr. Trinidad H.
Pardo de Tavera, lecturing on February 26, 1924, in the University
of the Philippines, said:</p>

<blockquote>Let us not indulge in idle dreams. Let us admit that
there is no such thing as a Filipino race.</blockquote>

<p>The native population of the Philippines falls of itself into
three perfectly distinct main divisions&mdash;the Mountain people
of the Island of Luzon, comprising several large and several
smaller absolutely distinct peoples commonly but inaccurately
classed under a general term as &quot;Igorots&quot;; the
Mohammedans, or Moros, of the Southern Islands; and the Christian
Filipinos. The first and second of these are essentially Malayan,
and of the overwhelming majority of the last the same is true.</p>

<p>But Igorot and Moro, alike, bitterly resent being herded under
the term &quot;Filipino.&quot; The line of demarcation is to them
at least as definite and as sensitive as is, to a Frenchman, the
line that protects France from the terror across the Rhine. Yet the
Filipino confessed&mdash;the Christianized
iowlander&mdash;outnumbers the others ten to one. And it is
exclusively of him, this Filipino proper, that the next chapters
will speak, leaving both Igorot and Moro for later thought.</p>

<p>As to the Filipinos, then:</p>

<p>Malays as they are, no caste system exists among them. And they
show but two classes&mdash;the <i>cacique,</i> or moneyed class,
which bosses and from which all* politicians come; and the
<i>tao,</i> or peasant class, which is bossed, and which has, in
practice, no voice whatever in governmental or political affairs.
The cacique class numbers perhaps six per cent of the total, and
rests, not upon inherited position, but wholly upon the grip of
money and of political influence, however recently acquired.</p>

<p>Speaking always in general, the cacique has one occupation
&mdash;&quot;politics&quot;; one industry&mdash;usury; one
hobby&mdash;gambling. Whatever he or his friends may profess for
purposes of foreign or domestic propaganda, his acts show him
fundamentally indifferent to the fate of the great mass of the
people&mdash;of the ninety-four per cent, whom he mercilessly
exploits and oppresses and whom he holds in open scorn mingled with
a sort of bitter resentment due to the mingling, in his own veins,
of the people&#39;s blood.</p>

<p>For the cacique is a <i>mestizo,</i> as the Spanish called
him&mdash;a hybrid. He is a Malay compounded with the Spanish or
Chinese.</p>

<h2>Chapter II &mdash; THE MARK OF THE BEAST</h2>

<p>The political unit in the Philippine Islands is the little
cacique&mdash;the small local boss. This is the keystone fact in
the make-up of Filipino-conceived control.</p>

<p>The little cacique takes his orders from one a size bigger than
he. And so on up to the seats of the Big Caciques in Manila. Much
as in Tammany&#39;s plan, but with an essential difference.</p>

<p>Voters there are, but an idea of the probable independence of
their ballots may be derived from what is later to be said on such
topics as usury, peonage and the channels and possible strength of
public opinion.</p>

<p>To picture to yourself the figure of the little cacique, you
must first deliver your mind from the treacherously recurring
subconscious idea that he is a brown-skinned New England squire
living in a tropical Lexington or Concord.</p>

<p>Because he is not, and does not. He is the local political boss,
who lives, unless he is an absentee boss, in the better house of a
very pretty village, or a <i>barrio.<sup>1</sup></i></p>

<p class="sup"><sup>1</sup>The whole territory of the Philippines,
regardless of population, is divided into municipalities. A barrio
is a segment of a municipality. This is the Spaniards&#39;
arrangement.</p>

<p>The barrio, like the village, is mainly composed of one- or
two-roomed shacks, whose walls and roofs are made of screens woven
of grass or palm-leaves neatly lashed upon slender bamboo frames.
The shacks, whose life is from two to three years, are
single-storied and stand high on stilts. This arrangement not only
keeps them relatively dry, in raintime, but also gives an open
storage place beneath. Here are kept, beside the big basket of rice
on which the family subsists, the cook-pot, the wooden plough, the
two or three fowls, and also the carabao <sup>2</sup> and the pony,
if the household is so rich as to possess them.</p>

<p class="sup"><sup>2</sup> A water-buffalo, the draft animal of
the Philippines.</p>

<p>No sanitation exists, and the invariable pig, although
ultimately eaten, is maintained primarily to serve for the
nonexistent closet. No other provision is made either for sewage
disposal or for the pig&#39;s support. His hip bones almost cut
through his skin. He is always starving. His hunger, in the
intervals of his duties, often drives him into the highway, which
he clogs. His sides cave in and all his ribs protrude. In every way
piteous and embarrassing, he is the adjunct of every home, and is
to be found as certainly in the skirts of the city of Manila as
throughout the provinces.</p>

<p>Anywhere from five to fifteen persons, adult and children, may
inhabit these one- or two-room dwellings. The rooms may be eight by
ten feet square. At night every aperture will be shut tight to keep
away the malignant spirits that fill night air. But by day the
screens are pushed back from the windows, and all the simple
intimacies of life are laid bare to the passer-by, including the
inevitable noontide hunting parties co-operatively conducted
through the family&#39;s hair.</p>

<p>There may be a new-fangled artesian well in the barrio. But even
if there is, many are the ancient uses of a little drainage-ditch
beside the highway. Here, within a space of fifty yards, I have
seen women laundering garments, women washing dishes, women
scrubbing meat for the pot, a man washing a dog, a pig nuzzling,
and several naked youngsters kicking up the mud, while others
dipped drinking water in earthen vessels for household use.</p>

<p>The people of the barrio speak a certain dialect&mdash;one of a
possible eighty-odd. They know no other tongue. And the confines of
the little field in which its dialect is spoken are the confines of
any barrio&#39;s knowledge of the world.</p>

<p>Tenants of the cacique for the most part, and tillers of his
soil, the people work fairly steadily, considering the facts that
all are undernourished, that over eighty per cent have worms and
that their economic outlook is dull. Their congenital passion for
gambling would of itself be enough to keep them always in debt, and
practically every barrio of any size has its cock-pit&mdash;which,
by the way, is in far better repair than its rickety skeleton
church. The women may be credited with whatever is done in the way
of conserving of funds, but barrio people are doing well when they
pass from crop to crop without a starvation interval between.</p>

<p>Six pesos <sup>3</sup>&mdash;three American dollars&mdash;is the
average family&#39;s entire income for a fortnight. And how big six
pesos can look may be gleaned from a narrative related by
Major-General E. B. Babbitt, U.S.A., of a personal experience in
the Islands.</p>

<p class="sup"><sup>3</sup> A peso equals fifty cents gold.</p>

<p>General Babbitt one day conceived the idea that he would like to
go a-fishing. So, being in Manila, he picked up a friend and rode
out to a promising spot in Laguna Province, where he bargained with
a tao fisherman. Two good days the party spent, and in the end paid
their man six round bright silver pesos&mdash;three dollars
American&mdash;much money. So that the tao went home to his shack
treading on clouds. And after he had handed the treasure to his
wife, the pair sat late into the night planning and dreaming about
the wonders it should bring forth.</p>

<p>But the news of those six pesos somehow leaked out into the
barrio. Like flame on oil it flew, swift to the <i>presidente&#39;s
*</i> ears.</p>

<p class="sup"><sup>4</sup>Head man, mayor.</p>

<p>Whereupon the pr&eacute;sidente sent for the tao and, without
reasons given, threw him into jail.</p>

<p>In jail, then, the wretched man cowered, silent, uncomplaining,
half-dead with shapeless fear. Until, the time being enough, the
pr&eacute;sidente sent for him and said:</p>

<p>&quot;It appears that you are a very evil fellow. You are a
robber&mdash;a bandit. What have you to say?&quot;</p>

<p>The tao stammered out his protestation.</p>

<p>&quot;But the Americans say you are a bandit, and you must be
shot,&quot; the pr&eacute;sidente went on.</p>

<p>The tao wept. The pr&eacute;sidente pondered, with deep-ribbed
brow and introspective eyes. Finally he spoke: &quot;It is true
that these Americans are a rough and violent people. But I am a
cacique. I am boss of the barrio. I have, of course, much power. A
way might be found...but, no!&quot;</p>

<p>The tao implored, fawning.</p>

<p>&quot;No&mdash;no&mdash;it is impossible. It would cost too
much.&mdash;Now, if I had six pesos&mdash;if there were any way of
getting six pesos &mdash;I might be able to arrange it&mdash;to buy
the Americans off.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;May it please your honour&mdash;send and call my
wife,&quot; moaned the tao, beating his hands on his breast.</p>

<p>The wife came hastily to the <i>presidencia.</i><sup>5</sup>
Together the pair took distracted counsel, while the
pr&eacute;sidente waited, solemn and aloof.</p>

<p class="sup"><sup>5</sup> Town hall.</p>

<p>&quot;May it please your honour&mdash;I have six
pesos&mdash;just six pesos in the world&mdash;I will run and bring
them&mdash;&quot; the woman finished, crushed.</p>

<p>So the cacique received the six pesos, the woman went home to
weep and the tao went back to jail.</p>

<p>Two days later the great man sent for the prisoner. &quot;I have
bought off the Americans. It was very difficult. You are
lucky,&quot; he said. &quot;And yet&mdash;I think you would do well
to take your wife and make off to the hills. You never can trust
these Americans. If they come back and find you here there is no
telling. They might...!&quot;</p>

<p>The tao shook again with fear&mdash;even as he was meant to do.
And, still shaking, thanked the cacique humbly, picked up his wife
and his bolo, and departed in haste to the mountains, there to
become in good earnest a robber of wayfarers and all unprotected
folk.</p>

<p>The bottom cacique is the ultimate, natural and essential
channel through which his own bosses, in their ascending series,
reach and control the bottom dog. H&eacute; is the interpreter, to
the barrio, of anything that it sees or hears outside its own
domestic life. Much the same might be said of a Tammany Hall ward
boss. But there is also a difference: The cacique rules, not by
favour, but by fear&mdash;by the blind, black tyranny of fear. And
the docile ignorance of the masses is his strength. How complete
that ignorance can be would scarcely be grasped through
generalities.</p>

<p>Mr. A. W. Prautch, Chief of the Rural Credit Division, Bureau of
Agriculture, is one of the few American officials left in the
Philippine Government. Mr. Prautch&#39;s life is spent in
journeyings to and fro around the provinces on errands of help.</p>

<p>One day it happened that Mr. Prautch, travelling in Ilocos Norte
in company with the Governor of that province, came to the town of
San Nicolas on the China Sea. Together the two men went first to
the presidencia. There, while the Governor talked with the
pr&eacute;sidente and his assembled official staff, the American
went strolling about the building to see what might be seen.</p>

<p>The first thing that particularly struck his attention was a
wretched, hopeless-looking woman with a small child wailing in her
arms, crouched on the bare floor of the jail.</p>

<p>Now, the jail being not only under the presidencia roof, but
also, at the moment, under the Provincial Governor&#39;s nose, it
was easy for Mr. Prautch to direct the Provincial Governor&#39;s
eyes that way.</p>

<p>&quot;Look!&quot; murmured the American, quietly nudging his
companion. &quot;See that woman hugging the sick baby yonder in the
cell. She looks as though she had lost her last friend. You might
ask why she is there.&quot;</p>

<p>The Governor complied.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah,&quot; said the pr&eacute;sidente, &quot;yes. It shall
be explained. The woman is there to take care of the
baby.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But why is the baby there?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah!&quot; replied the pr&eacute;sidente again, &quot;let
us see.&mdash;Yes. The baby is there because he is guilty of crime.
The crime of arson.&quot;</p>

<p>The Governor turned to Mr. Prautch in bewilderment.
&quot;Impossible!&quot; he exclaimed.</p>

<p>&quot;Let&#39;s ask further,&quot; urged Prautch.</p>

<p>And so, bit by bit, the tale came out, drawn by the
Governor&#39;s questions.</p>

<p>The woman, it appeared, was the wife of a poor labourer. One day
when the man was off in the fields working, the woman climbed down
the ladder of the shack and went to look for faggots to boil the
evening rice. The baby, then just learning to creep, remained alone
in the room. The baby was supposed to show discretion.</p>

<p>What he did do, seemingly, was to hitch his way over to the
fire-pot and pull out a pretty red ember. After which it would be a
matter of minutes, no more, before the whole little nipa-palm shack
would blaze. The neighbours rescued the baby. But the
house&mdash;which by the way belonged to the labourer and his wife
and was all they owned in the world&mdash;the house on golden wings
had vanished into the sun before the poor mother came back.</p>

<p>Meantime, the police, running quickly, reported to the town
authorities that a house had been burned.</p>

<p>&quot;A house has been burned? Why, then,&quot; said the
authorities, &quot;there must be a trial. To-morrow bring the
people before the Justice of the Peace.&quot;</p>

<p>And so it was done, duly and in order.</p>

<p>&quot;Who set this house on fire?&quot; asked the Justice of the
Peace.</p>

<p>&quot;If it please your honour, the baby,&quot; said the
neighbours. &quot;It must have been the baby. Nobody else was
there.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then,&quot; continued the Justice, &quot;the perpetrator
being found, it becomes a question of motive: Why did the baby set
the house on fire?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nobody can tell,&quot; said the neighbours. &quot;Nobody
was there.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But&quot;&mdash;and the magistrate became
severe&mdash;&quot;this is a trial, remember. We have found the
offender. Now, we are obliged to find his motive. That comes next.
You must <i>think.</i> Now think: Did the baby set the house afire
on purpose?&quot;</p>

<p>The neighbours thought, as bid.&mdash;Finally they produced the
required statement:</p>

<p>The baby assuredly must have set the house afire on purpose,
since he had only himself to consult at the time.</p>

<p>&quot;Aha!&quot; exclaimed the Magistrate. &quot;Then the case
is complete. Setting a house afire on purpose is a crime. It is
called arson. This prisoner is committed to jail to await trial on
charges of arson.&quot;</p>

<p>So the policeman picked the baby out of its mother&#39;s arms,
solemnly walked off to the jail, and locked the baby up.</p>

<p>But within the hour he was back again.</p>

<p>&quot;Please, your honour, who is to feed the
prisoner?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why, the jailer, of course.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But&mdash;the jailer&mdash;he says he can&#39;t.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Tell him he must,&quot; said the Justice, growing angry.
&quot;It is his duty.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But what, you nuisance?&quot; shouted the Justice, his
patience gone.</p>

<p>&quot;But, your honour, this prisoner isn&#39;t weaned. He just
sucks.&quot;</p>

<p>So this, as new evidence, re-opened the case, and brought about
another hearing, whose fruit was the decision that, as the mother
was, in a manner of speaking, an essential part of the prisoner,
she also must go to jail.</p>

<p>And there, in close confinement, the pair had thenceforth
lain.</p>

<p>Meantime the husband and father&mdash;the old tao
labourer&mdash;worked in the fields all day, while at night he
cooked the food he earned and brought it to the jail. The wife
could do nothing but sit on the floor and hold the baby in her
flaccid arms.</p>

<p>There was nothing else to do. And the baby, wailing and pining,
against its every interest continued somehow to live.</p>

<p>But no one in the town of San Nicolas, least of all the town
authorities, saw anything strange in the case. One day it would be
tried; meantime, it awaited trial. An unfortunate affair, perhaps,
for the three concerned, yes. But how did it concern anybody else?
Who else was hurt?</p>

<p>Said the Governor of Ilocos Norte to Mr. Prautch:</p>

<p>&quot;This is lamentable. But nothing can be done. The thing is
now a matter of record and must follow the process of
law.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh! Governor, let&#39;s cut through it. This is Saturday.
Let&#39;s you and me bail the baby out till Monday. Our word will
be enough. You explain to the J.P. and the Mayor and the Council.
When Monday comes, have the hearing, with all the evidence. And
then&mdash;just suspend judgment. See?&quot;</p>

<p>So by the illumination of Mr. Prautch, the baby got out.</p>

<p>The Filipino is an individualist. At his present stage of
development, tao or cacique, he is for himself and his immediate
friends only, and the sorrows of others, man or beast, have yet to
find their place in his reckoning.</p>

<p>One day last winter I sat talking with a tao farmer, in his own
district, concerning his own exceptional history. Exceptional not
in his sufferings, which could be matched in half the shacks in
every barrio, but in his having dared to stand up to his fate and
show fight. His story is a matter of established record. For
obvious reasons his name should be spared. Let us call him Pedro.
He is a quiet little body, somewhat crippled and scarred. To
abbreviate the tale and begin halfway through, it runs thus:</p>

<p>In 1921, his old blind mother, who owned a good homestead plot,
or thought she did, found herself therefore in conflict with the
cacique, who wanted the land for himself. Her daughter, Pedro&#39;s
sister, helped the old woman in affirming her claim. This resulted
in the arrest of the sister, who was thrown into jail. Having
fasted all that day, at night-time the girl begged for food. On
pretext of acceding to her request, the town police-sergeant took
her outside the jail and attempted rape. She struggled, escaped,
and finally reported the matter to her brother Pedro, who,
energetically backed by the two or three Americans in the region,
entered a complaint.</p>

<p>This act of Pedro&#39;s startled the whole countryside. No tao
had been known to show such temerity. Hearing of it, many other
women came to Pedro begging him to present their claims for
redress. So that it became clear that the fate of Pedro&#39;s
sister was the customary fate of women jailed. But, though Pedro
duly accused the sergeant of municipal police before the municipal
council, the accused went free. Because, as Pedro points out, the
members of the municipal council were all the Sergeant&#39;s
<i>parientes&mdash;</i>relatives&mdash;a word of great content in
the Islands.</p>

<p>A little later the same Pedro made himself serviceable to the
Wood-Forbes Commission, through his knowledge of English and
through his good faith as translator in the investigation of usury
cases. This touched the local caciques on a very tender spot, and
made evident the necessity of quieting the little man.</p>

<p>It came on the night of December 26, 1921. All day long Pedro
and his family had been hard at work in the rice paddies, for it
was harvest time. And now, at 9 o&#39;clock, they lay sound asleep
on their mats at home&mdash;Pedro on his back, as it chanced, his
right arm tossed over his face.</p>

<p>Perhaps that arm saved him&mdash;for the first bolo-slash cut
his right wrist almost in two.</p>

<p>Up sprang the sleeper with just time, before the next blow
landed, to recognize in the three men before him the same old
sergeant of municipal police and two police officers. Then they got
him again, and yet again, across the head, till he fell
unconscious. On this they left him, lying in his blood&mdash;left
him for dead.</p>

<p>Then Pedro&#39;s wife and the young sister who already knew that
sergeant of police crept out to the neighbours and begged for
help,&mdash;begged above all that some one should run and telephone
the nearest Constabulary post. Two Constabulary officers came. And
while the one gave first aid to Pedro, the other pursued the
assailants. Two he caught that night; the third two days later
on.</p>

<p>All three now lie in Bilibid<sup>6</sup> prison.</p>

<p class="sup"><sup>6</sup> The great Government prison in
Manila.</p>

<p>So much for Pedro&#39;s past trials. He is marked
&quot;dangerous,&quot; and more punishment, on general principles
of discipline, all too probably awaits him.</p>

<p>&quot;They don&#39;t want a simple farmer to raise his
head,&quot; Pedro repeats, with a look, as he speaks, that shows
his spirit is not yet broken by the mortal odds against him.</p>

<p>Pedro is one in ten thousand. And this is the way our
t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te closed:</p>

<p>&quot;Are you going to Manila soon?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Is Governor-General Wood there?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I want to see the Governor-General. I want to ask him a
favour. I have done what I could for the Government. I know
Governor-General Wood befriends us taos. I think he would help
me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do you want me to know your request?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. I have a friend&mdash;a pariente of mine&mdash;he
helped me when I was hurt, and I would like to help him
now.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What does he need?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, he is in Bilibid. I want him pardoned out. I think
it isn&#39;t much for me to ask, who have had such great
trouble.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What is your friend in prison for?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, a trifle&mdash;only a woman case.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do you mean,&quot; I asked, &quot;do you mean that your
friend assaulted some woman&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, yes, but it was <i>nothing!&quot;</i> answered Pedro,
almost impatiently. &quot;Why, she was under age&mdash;a mere
child!&quot;</p>

<p>In intelligence, in education, in courage, in character, Pedro
is one in ten thousand. But Pedro is a Malay. An individualist. The
outrage of his sister aroused his wrath because it was his sister
who suffered. But let that same thing befall a girl&mdash;any
number of girls&mdash;across the fields, and Pedro sees nothing in
it.&mdash;You may talk to him of humanity, of public duty, of
common purpose, until your breath is done, without in the slightest
degree touching his mind. He likes the words, and uses them. They
sound fine. But their active meaning is outside the range of his
mentality. And this is no charge against Pedro. It is simply a
biological fact.</p>

<p>High in the cacique oligarchy to-day&mdash;as far above the
humble members we have just been considering as the weath-ervane is
above the corner-stone&mdash;stands a certain shrewd and sinuous
Spanish mestizo. By young Filipino college students this man is
ardently admired. By most Filipinos he is con-sumingly feared, for
his power in their world is great. In America he is courteously
received and respectfully listened to.</p>

<p>I have before me the official report, several copies of which
exist, in this country and in the Islands, of an investigation into
his conduct in office at a period twenty years ago, when he was
Prosecuting Attorney, or &quot;Fiscal,&quot; of a large Island
Province. The report, despite the usually formal language, gives a
graphic picture of his habits of life at that time. His fellow
Filipinos to-day assert that during the two decades intervening
those habits have changed only in steadily increased
self-indulgence, and in greater and greater disregard for any law
but that of his own personal ambition and pleasure. All this, in
detail, has been common knowledge. And it is exceedingly
significant that that knowledge has in no wise interfered with his
secure advance toward the summit of the cacique structure.</p>

<p>The report shows him, first, on the road between town and town,
riding his circuit. He travels like a satrap, with bearers in
relays of fifteen to carry his belongings. But he is off his
schedule&mdash;a whole day late. And the bearers whom he had
ordered to attend his arrival at a given point, believing that he
had abandoned his trip, have grown tired waiting and have gone home
upon their own occasions. Reaching the spot, and furious not to
find his men, the official draws his revolver upon the first
villager that appears and orders him to run for his life in search
of the missing bearers.</p>

<p>Now, it should be noted that these men are not bearers by
calling, but are merely the neighbours&mdash;the local
taos&mdash;the farmers of the countryside.</p>

<p>After five hours&#39; hard foot-travel the messenger returns
with the fifteen men, all badly frightened, whom he has collected
one by one from their widely-scattered dwellings. Whereupon, this
Fiscal, this Prosecuting Attorney of the Province, to reward his
messenger, first strikes him in the mouth, then kicks him flat, and
finally orders him to set to and soundly beat his friends the taos,
who have dared to keep a cacique waiting.</p>

<p>&quot;It was Mr. &mdash;&mdash;&#39;s custom to call for bearers
to take him from town to town,&quot; interposes the record,
&quot;but not his custom to pay these bearers. In fact, he did not
pay them. This particular form of forced and unpaid labour is one
of the customs of the country and in compelling the work of the
lowly in this manner Mr. &mdash;&mdash; was but following the
custom.&quot;</p>

<p>The Fiscal&#39;s travelling mate at this period was a notorious
criminal, then awaiting trial by the Fiscal himself on a very
serious charge. But after certain incidents of the tour, of most of
which this man was a witness, the Fiscal &quot;provisionally
dismissed&quot; the charge against his companion.</p>

<p>Very briefly, the incidents in question were these:&mdash;</p>

<p>The Fiscal, in the course of an official visit to the northern
end of his province, had seen and admired a certain barrio girl.
So, on his next appearance, he ordered one of the men of that
barrio to give a dance and invite the girl&mdash;that he, the
Fiscal, might meet her.</p>

<p>That night, after the dance, the girl, with four other women,
including the barrio school-teacher, had spread their mats in a
neighbour&#39;s shack and had gone to sleep together, when a
stealthy foot on the ladder, a groping hand on the floor, awakened
the school-teacher.</p>

<p>&quot;Who is there?&quot; she called.</p>

<p>&quot;The Fiscal. I want Tomasa.&quot; All in the dark he found
the girl and laid hold upon her.</p>

<p>But she fought him off. The record reads: &quot;The women were
all frightened and cowered in one corner of the small room. Tomasa
with them. Being unable to find her again, the Fiscal lit a match,
discovered her, and succeeded in separating her from her
companions. He then by threats to kill her sought to overcome her
resistance. In this he was unsuccessful, owing to her strenuous
objections and the presence of the others awake, and finally
departed, baffled.&quot;</p>

<p>Next morning he continued his official tour. Three days later,
however, he returned and again ordered a dance to be given, by the
same tao as before, Tomasa again to be invited. The tao, for his
life, complied.</p>

<p>This time all plans worked out. And next day the girl,
&quot;flattered by the attentions of so great and powerful a man as
the Fiscal of the province,&quot; followed him to his home.</p>

<p>Then comes the poor old father of Tomasa&mdash;missing the girl,
hearing the rumour of her fate, standing that night before the
Fiscal&#39;s door, knocking, knocking, and calling to his
daughter.</p>

<p>And the Fiscal, with his ready revolver levelled through the
crack, orders the old man to be off and hold his tongue, lest worse
befall him.</p>

<p>But the father, greatly daring, goes instead to the Justice of
the Peace to declare his woes; to which that officer responds that
it is better to be quiet, for no good ever comes of making
complaints against a man as powerful as the Fiscal.</p>

<p>The record goes on into curious labyrinths, valuable, despite
their squalor, because of the light they throw on the general
condition of the common people and on the relation of the cacique
thereto. Tomasa has two &quot;parientes,&quot; Bartolome and Paulo,
both accused as horse thieves by the Fiscal himself, in sworn
complaint before a magistrate. This was before Tomasa came into the
story. Both men had pleaded guilty and both lay awaiting trial when
Tomasa&#39;s charms first caught the Fis-cal&#39;s eye.</p>

<p>Whereupon he, as a matter of privilege and complaisance,
dismissed the case.</p>

<p>Now it happened that the horses stolen were United States Army
horses. And one of the United States Government&#39;s witnesses
against Bartolome, the horse thief, was a tao called Simeon. (His
other name, every one&#39;s name, with dates and places, are all
here in this document. But since we are not using the Fiscal&#39;s
name, why pillory the taos?) So Bartolome, hating Simeon because
Simeon had borne witness against him, made speedy use of his
liberty to hunt Simeon up. Having found him, he fell upon that
Government witness with his bolo, and, before he had done, had
nearly severed Simeon&#39;s arm from his shoulder.</p>

<p>Bartolome, such, apparently, was his belief in his pretty
cousin&#39;s protector, took this his vengeance openly, in the
sight of three witnesses, taos like himself. These three now came
before the Justice of the Peace to testify to the crime. Meantime,
word sped to Tomasa, enthroned in the Fiscal&#39;s house, of cousin
Bartolome&#39;s plight. And the Fiscal, indignant that any voice
should be raised against even a horse thief who enjoyed his
protection, arose and marched into the Justice&#39;s office while
yet the hearing progressed.</p>

<p>The Justice, after one glance from his great visitor, needed no
further orders to take himself out of the room.</p>

<p>The Fiscal, then&mdash;so runs the report&mdash;being alone with
the three, &quot;threatened the men, not once but several times
that if they dared to testify against the accused he would have
them imprisoned in jail; and reminded them that in such case the
costs of the court would be greater than all their worldly
wealth.&quot;</p>

<p>And he, the Prosecuting Attorney of the Province, made it clear
to these Government witnesses that if, when the case came up for
trial, they did not change their story and perjure themselves in
court, means would be found to make them rue it.</p>

<p>The three men left the court&mdash;so the record goes
on&mdash;thoroughly intimidated by the Prosecuting Attorney&#39;s
threats and would undoubtedly have obeyed him implicitly, but for
the fact that an American Captain of Constabulary, appearing by
chance, vigorously advised them to stick to their word and their
rights, and promised them protection from violence.</p>

<p>So stimulated, the three actually did go back before the Justice
and sign their complaint as first stated.</p>

<p>From the point of view of the Prosecuting Attorney nothing could
have been more outrageous. Here was an outsider, an alien, an
American, teaching common taos to set up their wills against a
cacique, and promising them safety in their rebellion. To submit
were publicly to &quot;lose face,&quot; which is, to any Oriental,
the last and bitterest humiliation.</p>

<p>And yet&mdash;the thing was difficult. Not an element of secrecy
remained to lend cover to any radical step. And the American,
furthermore, was a Constabulary Officer. Obviously the Filipino
could not handle that American.&mdash;But, just as obviously, the
Prosecuting Attorney could handle the Court. Thus, after all, he
would gain his imperative point&mdash;&quot;save face,&quot; and
thereby emerge triumphant in the eyes of his people.</p>

<p>So the case came duly to trial. And the Court found Bar-tolome
guilty, as charged, of destroying a man&#39;s right arm, in
cold-blooded violence, for motive of revenge, that man being the
United States Government&#39;s witness. Then the Court gave
sentence.</p>

<p>The sentence was that Bartolome should spend ten days in jail
and pay a fine of fifteen pesetas&mdash;one dollar and a half
United States currency.</p>

<p>In its zeal of good will, the Court then turned about and fined
the one-armed Simeon&mdash;the injured man, who had entered no
complaint and against whom no charge had been preferred.</p>

<p>This procedure, the Judge afterward stated, was not to be
credited to his own wisdom, but had been suggested and approved by
the Fiscal himself.</p>

<p>So the record runs on. The result of the investigation was the
removal of the Fiscal from office, as &quot;guilty of conduct
unfitting him for employment as a public prosecutor.&quot;</p>

<p>Tomasa lasted in favour just one month.</p>

<p>This thing occurred in the winter of 1904. Twenty years ago. But
the fundamental mind of a populace still sixty-three per cent
illiterate changes but little in twenty years. The Tomasas and the
horse thief parientes, the Justices of the Peace and the caciques
are to-day, as a whole, just what they were at the beginning of the
century.</p>

<p>The Wood-Forbes report, written in 1921, says:</p>

<blockquote>The justice of the peace courts are the weakest point
in the judicial establishment. Complaints against these courts are
numerous and come from all parts of the archipelago. Because of the
remoteness and isolation of many of these tribunals, and the want
of frequent and effective supervision and inspection, many abuses
are perpetrated...<br>
<br>
Investigation also indicates very clearly that more care should be
exercised in the selection of fiscals or prosecuting
attorneys.</blockquote>

<h2>Chapter III &mdash; GOD HELP THE POOR</h2>

<p>Usury is the heavy chain with which ninety per cent or more of
the Christian Filipinos are bound in slavery to the ten per cent or
less. Usury is the curse of the Islands, and very few are the
Filipino fortunes that do not stand upon that base.</p>

<p>In 1569, Legazpi, the Spanish conqueror, reported of the
Filipinos: <i><sup>1</sup></i></p>

<p class="sup"><sup>1</sup> <i>The Philippine Islands,</i> Blair
&amp; Robertson. Cleveland, 1903. Vol. Ill, p. 55.</p>

<blockquote>When these people give or lend anything to one another,
the favor must be repaid double, even if between parents and
children, or between brothers. At times they sell their own
children, when there is little need or necessity to do
so.</blockquote>

<p>In 1574, Guido de Lavezaris, writing of the natives, informed
the King of Spain: <sup>2</sup></p>

<p class="sup"><sup>2</sup> <i>Ibid,</i> p. 287-8.</p>

<blockquote>If any one who is left an orphan come to the house of
another, even of a kinsman (unless it be his uncle, paternal or
maternal), for food only, the inmates enslave him...Many also
become slaves on account of loans, because these loans continue to
increase steadily every three or four months; and so, however
little may be the sum loaned them, at the end of little more or
less than two years they become slaves.</blockquote>

<p>In 1762, Diego Silang, a tao, led his brother taos in rebellion
against their usurious mestizo oppressors,&mdash;and was murdered
for his pains. One hundred and sixty years later Governor-General
Wood wrote in his annual message to the Filipino cacique
legislature:</p>

<blockquote>There should be much more stringent legislation against
usury. The law will never become efficient until an adequate prison
sentence is imposed upon the usurer. At present the victim is
afraid to invoke the law, knowing that, even if successful in
securing a conviction, the only result will be an insignificant
fine and forfeiture of the loan and that it will be impossible for
him to secure loans in the future. These conditions are the remains
of a form of caciquism with an attendant oppression of the poor and
helpless which amounts almost to...peonage...</blockquote>

<p>The Governor-General&#39;s language is tempered to the
&quot;sensitive&quot; nature of the politico, whose constant
complaint is of American brusqueness. But any real move to abate
the practice of usury meets the politico&#39;s determined
opposition.</p>

<p>The reason of all this is inseparable from the system of
control. The power of the political chiefs in Manila depends on the
power of the ward politicians, each in his own little place all
over the land. The main grip of these minor caciques lies in their
practice of money-lending at usury, which makes them masters of the
lives, including the votes, of the people. Some ninety-four per
cent of the entire Christian Filipino body live in tiny villages,
and are farmers or farm labourers. To provide sufficient funds, at
reasonable rates, to finance this great majority&#39;s
needs&mdash;as, for instance, by a well-extended system of
co-operative rural credit&mdash;would be to destroy by one blow the
cacique&#39;s political foundation, to release his serfs and to put
him out of business.</p>

<p>Therefore no Filipino Legislature has ever been willing to
favour a parent agricultural bank, or to allow to Rural Credit uses
the few thousand extra pesos needed to scatter about where they
would do great good.</p>

<p>This condition gnaws night and day at the root of the
Island&#39;s prosperity&mdash;at the roots of the peoples&#39;
existence, body and soul.</p>

<p>Now this subject can continue no farther without a description,
more detailed than that earlier given, of Mr. A. W. Prautch,
commonly known in the Philippine Islands as Deacon
Prautch:&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. Prautch came out from America as a preacher of the gospel
twenty-six years ago. Since which time he has never returned. A
compound of humour, immense vitality and fighting courage, he is
driven by a sense of justice and mercy and by a sympathy with the
poor and helpless that amounts to an obsession. Many years ago he
gave up preaching in order to devote all his time, seven days in
the week, to the lifting of sheep, bodily, out of the pit into
which the wolf pursues them.</p>

<p>It is an interesting thing to see a man of elder years,
white-haired, an American, defying time, fatigue, heat, dirt,
contagion, hardship, disappointment, malice, abuse, to serve, for
the love of serving, at a task whose only reward, for a quarter of
a century, has been in his own heart. The sheep themselves thank
him in the way sheep do. Rarely or never by conscious gratitude or
loyalty, but just by turning their simple faces toward him with
piteous bleats when the wolf draws nigh the fold.</p>

<p>Between times, sheep-like, they forget him.</p>

<p>But the wolf never forgets. Caciques, great and small, have
moments of most cordially hating &quot;one Prautch.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Deacon&quot; Prautch, as is generally conceded, has made
his name everywhere in the Islands another word for &quot;faithful,
familiar champion of the poor.&quot; This active championship led
him, in earlier days, to a place in the Agricultural Department, in
which he himself instituted the always grudgingly sustained Rural
Credit Division, of which he is chief. He is never cautious. His
methods are ever those of swift and open attack&mdash;the opener
the better. The newspapers are his first weapon, publicity his
dearest ally.</p>

<p>&quot;Mr. Prautch, you take work too seriously,&quot; Director
Her-nandez, of the Agricultural Department, was wont to say.
&quot;When anything comes along that you don&#39;t like, the thing
to do is, not to bother your head, but just file it. See?&quot;</p>

<p>Which is precisely the Insular method. Few Filipinos in office
like to make a final decision and to assume the duty of putting
that decision into force when it is possible to pass the point
along to some one else, preferably to the Courts, where it may be
trusted to lie quiet until Heaven knows when. So that it is a
common thing to see a paper upon which the first official recipient
should have acted, weighted with a comet&#39;s tail of twenty-odd
endorsements and still travelling.</p>

<p>Deacon Prautch rarely sends a complaint to a Filipino superior.
Instead, he writes it to the local vernacular newspapers, of which
there are few, and to the Spanish, English and dialect newspapers
of Manila, so that all who see shall profit by the airing. And
thereby it has happened that even the Secretary of Justice has been
grieved.</p>

<p>&quot;My dear Mr. Prautch, why do you write these things about
our Justices of the Peace, and so on, to the newspapers, instead of
to me? Governor-General Wood&mdash;well&mdash;you know how peculiar
<i>he</i> is! He sees your things in the newspaper, and he cuts
them out and sends them to me. Afterwards he asks questions, and
again questions. It is most annoying.&quot;</p>

<p>The case of Maria Aquino came to light before the accession of
Governor-General Wood, but is still typical in every way. Maria
Aquino, at the age of forty-five, was already a bent old woman,
worn down with hard work. She lived in the barrio of Cruz, suburb
of Victoria in the Province of Tarlac, Luzon. With her husband she
rented a parcel of land that the two cultivated and on which they
had built their own house.</p>

<p>Their landlord was a resident of Victoria, a man of means and
standing, called Pedro Abad.</p>

<p>For over four years Maria Aquino delved on this land by her
husband&#39;s side, and the two did well enough not only to feed
themselves and Maria&#39;s helpless old mother, but also to put a
little money by.</p>

<p>Then Maria&#39;s husband fell ill, so that she now had two to
wait upon and three to feed by her unaided efforts. Which meant to
double her labour. Therefore she worked her own land, and worked
for her neighbours as well, wading up to her knees in mud in
rice-transplanting time, then digging, threshing, burden-bearing.
And yet, bit by bit, again and yet again, she found herself driven
to draw from the cash reserve.</p>

<p>At last it was all gone. And her own crops&mdash;her early rice,
her late rice, and her hectare of sugar-cane, were not yet
ripe.</p>

<p>So she went to Pedro Abad, the rich man, of whom, until then,
she was debt-free, and asked for a loan.</p>

<p>Readily he gave it to her. Thirty pesos&mdash;fifteen dollars.
Two weeks later, her early rice being ready, she begged the aid of
her neighbours and cut the yield. Then they threshed it, out in the
field, beating the heavy bunches with long-armed blows upon a
hump-backed rock. And it threshed eighteen
<i>cavans.<sup>3</sup></i></p>

<p class="sup"><sup>3</sup> A cavan, the rice measure of the
Philippines, equals 2.13 bushels.</p>

<p>Paying two pesos to the bull-cart men who carried it, she sent
the full crop to her landlord, Pedro Abad, of Victoria, in payment
of the thirty pesos that she had borrowed of him a fortnight
before.</p>

<p>A few days later her husband died.</p>

<p>After that, although her late rice was in a stage to cut, she
let it stand for a while until she could repay her neighbours, by
work in their fields, for the help they had just given her; and
until, also, she could earn return help in the heavy labour of her
own harvesting.</p>

<p>All this she had duly accomplished, and, with her poor
neighbours&#39; aid, had already gleaned her late rice and stacked
it ready for threshing, when Pedro Abad, the landlord, descended
upon her in wrath. This was on December 21, 1920.</p>

<p>&quot;What do you mean,&quot; he demanded, &quot;by keeping me
waiting for this rice of mine? Why, it was ready to harvest many
days ago, and you, idle creature, let it stand, while I wait for my
dues! And that sugar-cane yonder, ready and still uncut! You
deserve to go to jail for your wickedness. Look here, my men will
be here on Tuesday, with their bull-carts to draw that cane to my
mill. If it is not ready to load when they get here, you will
regret it.&quot;</p>

<p>Said Maria Aquino, with the courage that weak things sometimes
find when driven beyond hope:</p>

<p>&quot;Pedro Abad has taken all my early rice&mdash;eighteen
cavans&mdash;for a debt of thirty pesos. Pedro Abad has always
taken all my rice and all my sugar, and has always given me back a
cheating return. And I have always submitted because I was afraid.
But not again.</p>

<p>&quot;When this rice is threshed it is going to be divided into
two equal stacks. You shall take one, Pedro Abad, and one I shall
keep, and my half I shall sell for real money, and the money will
be mine. And so with the cane. I have planted it, like the rice,
with my own two hands, and worked it all alone, until it is ripe.
Now I will cut it and divide it into two piles. But you will not
again take it all&mdash;my pile with yours&mdash;and carry it away
to your mill to grind in order that you may afterward tell me that
it was not enough and that I owe you loss-money that I must pay
back to you. You have beaten me with your stick. You have hurt me
and robbed me and scared me, all these years. But now, whatever you
do, you shall have only your half of the cane cut. I will keep
mine, and I shall sell it for real money so that my old mother and
I do not starve before the next crop.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We shall see,&quot; said Pedro Abad.</p>

<p>So he departed and straightway swore out a warrant for Maria
Aquino&#39;s arrest. In it he charged that she had violated the
contract law, Act 2098, in that, after having rented ground of him
and having taken as advance the sum of seventy-four pesos and
twenty-three cavans of rice, she had</p>

<blockquote>voluntarily, illegally and maliciously refused to work,
nor did she return the sums taken.<br>
<br>
Signed, Pedro P. Abad, Accuser.</blockquote>

<p>So they arrested Maria Aquino and threw her into the municipal
jail, where she lay until, as it chanced, the president of the
local Rural Credit Association, a tao, discovered the fact. Then
he, with the aid of another tao, one of the Rural Credit
shareholders, bailed the woman out so that, pending her trial, the
aged mother in the shack need not die of neglect.</p>

<p>Seventeen days later the case was tried in court, and, in
default of a single scrap of evidence, was dismissed.</p>

<p>Whereupon, Pedro Abad, to preserve discipline in the barrio,
abandoned the roundabout methods of the law and by main force drove
Maria off the land, seized her house, her un-threshed crop of late
rice and her hectare of standing sugar-cane and left her in the
road with her mother in her arms, homeless and destitute, with no
human recourse save the charity of neighbours only less poor than
herself.</p>

<p>Deacon Prautch, learning of this matter through the local Rural
Credit organization, went straight to the spot, checked up the
facts and promptly wrote them in full to the newspapers. The
newspapers, in full, printed them. Upon which the Bureau of Justice
sent out an investigator, who came back, reporting:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;I find no trouble.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>Then the Deacon went to the Governor-General, Mr. Francis Burton
Harrison, and said: &quot;That investigator lies. I am hot from the
sight of that poor, work-worn, shrivelled old woman&#39;s misery.
The thing is a crime. And this Victoria Rural Credit Association of
mine has 580 members, nearly all of whom have been made to suffer
as this poor soul is suffering now.&quot;</p>

<p>So the Governor-General ordered another man sent out.</p>

<p>But this messenger also went forth with a whitewash brush in his
hand.</p>

<p>Again the Deacon repaired to the Governor-General. A third time
a Bureau of Justice agent went out who, returning, stated:</p>

<p>&quot;There has been no active usury. But there was no debt and
the landlord has certainly seized all the woman&#39;s
crops.&quot;</p>

<p>So an order was issued for the arrest of Pedro Abad.</p>

<p>In such cases, the common procedure is for the cacique to say to
the officer bearing the arrest papers something like this:</p>

<p>&quot;Here, get into my automobile. Come up to dinner and
we&#39;ll talk this matter over. I control a lot of votes. I am a
good party man. What do we care for these fool Americans? Let&#39;s
make a night of it.&quot;</p>

<p>Pedro Abad, it is stated, was not arrested. Nor has any action
yet been had against him. Neither has he to this day made any
restitution to the widow, his prey.</p>

<p>All this befell in a period when the hand that governed the
Philippines was lax. To-day such a matter, once in the cognizance
of the Governor-General, scarcely ends that way. Yet for one such
case that reaches the notice of the American Executive, a thousand
pass in voiceless obscurity according to the ancient custom of the
land.</p>

<p>As to Deacon Prautch&#39;s work, by far the major part of it is
done personally, in the field, and by hard, rough travel that takes
him wherever the tao is found. This is, first, because they have
clipped him down to the quick, both in men and in funds, so that he
must multiply his own personal effort. Second, because, granting
ten readers to each copy of each daily newspaper printed in the
Islands, ninety per cent of the population never reads a newspaper,
but learns the little news it knows only by word of mouth; so that
knowledge of the ways and means of a victory gained for one
victimized tao would never reach the hosts of his brother victims
were its dissemination left to the press alone; and, third,
because, in the uncertain state in which American lack of policy
keeps the Islands, no native can be expected to show the almost
quixotic courage that such work commonly demands. If a Filipino
makes the caciques hate him, who is going to protect him from
cacique vengeance if America goes?</p>

<p>Some few Filipinos, nevertheless, have come out openly in
reprobation of the abuse. Conspicuous among these is Senator
Teodoro Sandiko, who has put live action behind his words.</p>

<hr>
<a name="ch-04" id="ch-04"></a>
<h2>Chapter IV &mdash;THE SHEEP AND THE WOLVES</h2>

<p>In July, 1921<sub>;</sub> Senator Sandiko, in the name of the
common people, came before the Wood-Forbes Commission, then two
months in the Islands, with an appeal for redress&mdash;an appeal
that, as he knew, it was worse than useless to make to his
fellow-legislators. His plea was against the miseries inflicted
upon the poor under &quot;the Enslavement Act.&quot;
<i><sup>1</sup></i></p>

<p class="sup"><sup>1</sup>Act 2098.</p>

<p>The Manila <i>Bulletin,</i> of July 7, 1921, reporting Senator
Sandiko&#39;s appeal, says:</p>

<blockquote>This Act is commonly known as the Peonage Law. It
provides that peace officers must arrest and bring back for trial
tenants who have accepted advances of money or supplies on labor
contracts, and who leave the service of the man to whom they have
bound themselves before the debt is worked out. It is common
practice in the rice provinces to keep the tenants constantly in
debt, so that there is never a time when they cannot be jailed if
they quit work or shift to another master...unless the new master,
as is often the case, pays their debt and charges it against their
account with him.</blockquote>

<p>Said Senator Sandiko: <sup>2</sup></p>

<blockquote>I have four lawyers working with me to protect the
tenants from injustices of the justices of the peace and the town
caciques, but, because of the many cases arising, they cannot
attend to all of those seeking justice.<br>
<br>
I wish this law were repealed, but as I am the lone member of the
opposition in the Senate, I can&#39;t do anything. I want,
therefore, the Mission to investigate the whole matter. Whole
families of the indebted tenants are made servants of the
landlords, and many of the justices of the peace are mere tools of
the landlords...</blockquote>

<p class="sup"><i><sup>2</sup></i> Manila <i>Times,</i> July 7,
1921.</p>

<p>An illustration is afforded in the representative case of a
young tao couple who, backed by Mr. Percy A. Hill, of Mu&ntilde;oz,
found courage to make an affidavit of their woes. Mr. Hill is
another of that picturesque and gallant handful of Americans who,
like Deacon Prautch, have been in the Islands since the beginning
of our occupation, and who would probably long since have betaken
themselves home but for the appeal that friendless and innocent
misery, without a dog&#39;s chance against its enemies, makes to a
certain type of Anglo-Saxon fighting man.</p>

<p>So the young tao couple, cheered on by their American friend,
made oath to their story. The little wife was a cripple
&mdash;lame. Neither she nor her husband could read or write. A
pair of innocents, whom the wolf got. Here is the affidavit:</p>

<blockquote>We, the undersigned, Potenciana Florencio and Exequiel
Bernaldo, married and of legal age, residing in Bantug,
Mu&ntilde;oz, Nueva Erija, P. I., being duly sworn do hereby depose
and say:<br>
<br>
That we are tenants of Romualdo Blanco of Pinagpanaan, Guimba,
Nueva Ecija, and that during the months of July and August, 1920,
we received a quantity of sardines, cloth, bagong, etc., from the
store of El&iacute;seo L&aacute;zaro, brother-in-law of the
president of Mu&ntilde;oz, Nueva Ecija, with the understanding that
we should pay 13 cavans of palay<sup>3</sup> in the month of March,
1921.<br>
<br>
As our crop was killed by drought, we were unable to pay the debt,
as we were told that ^50 would (be required) to liquidate it. Later
we were told to place our thumb mark on a paper which we were told
purported to be a receipt for ^40.50 taken from El&iacute;seo in
money to purchase palay with, to be delivered to him. We did not
sign together, but at different times.<br>
<br>
As we could not pay, a charge of estafa [swindling] was placed
against us in the justice of the peace court at Mu&ntilde;oz, and
on or about August 15, 1921, we were arrested by the constabulary,
who took us to Mu&ntilde;oz, Nueva Ecija, and turned us over to the
sergeant of police. We were placed in confinement, Exequiel in the
old presidencia and Potenciana in the house used as a temporary
presidencia.<br>
<br>
During the night the sergeant of police came upstairs and forcibly
violated Potenciana in spite of her struggles, and in short
succession was followed by two other policemen whose names she does
not know.<br>
<br>
We remained as prisoners for four days, Exequiel having to work in
the gravel pit, this before trial. We were never brought before the
court, for El&iacute;seo made an agreement with the authorities so
that we were released and were made to sign a contract of service
to El&iacute;seo L&aacute;zaro. Exequiel was given three work
animals to look after, and Potenciana did the washing for the
family. We only consented to this arrangement as we had no other
remedy.<br>
<br>
We were therefore under two contracts, one to Romualdo Blanco, in
which we received and owe P50 as bugnus [dialect term for the class
of credit described], and P5 for which we must pay 50 cavans of
palay. As our crop was unable to be planted in total, owing to our
arrest, we cannot harvest a full crop, and we are bound to serve
the contract entered into by El&iacute;seo L&aacute;zaro, for the
debt as charged in the estafa case.<br>
<br>
POTENCIANA (mark) FLORENCIO, EXEQUIEL (mark) BERNALDO.</blockquote>

<p class="sup"><sup>3</sup> Palay, unpolished rice.</p>

<p>The affidavit is duly certified before a notary. It fails to
show whether or not Potenciana and Exequiel needed or wanted the
stores that they got from the cacique&#39;s pariente. But recorded
history indicates that, in any case, they would soon have been
forced to take a loan in some shape, as the foundation of their
relations with the landlord.</p>

<p>As, for example:</p>

<blockquote>Nasario Patauran...paid 18 cavans of palay as
rental...for land. He did not need of want a loan, but was forced
to take P30 and later on P10 more, to be repaid in palay reckoned
at P5 a cavan. The market price of palay at that time was
P8.50.<sup>4</sup></blockquote>

<p class="sup"><sup>4</sup>A. W. Prautch, <i>Official Report,</i>
Dec. 4, 1920.</p>

<p>Thrift plays small part in the average tao&#39;s character. And,
as will further be seen in connection with the land-shark plague,
the conditions of life under cacique rule would kill thrift in an
ant-hill.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the tao is the simplest and most childlike of
humanity. He can scarcely compel himself to think ahead of the day.
He wants a peso for the cock-fight. He knows his landlord will lend
him that peso&mdash;knows also that it will be written down in the
landlord&#39;s little book, to be heard of later on. But all that
he can really visualize is the cockfight.</p>

<p>So he goes and gets the peso. And the trap snaps shut.</p>

<p>A cacique proprietor owning twenty or thirty hectares of land
will take on two or three tenants. These tenants possessing no
draught-cattle, or tools, or seed, or money of their own, will come
empty-handed to the ground. Cattle, tools, seed and money will
therefore be furnished by the landlord, and at hopeless rates. The
money advanced is for daily food. And, as the tenant is to get no
pay for his labour until after the rice is harvested and the
landlord has sold the crop, that food-money must be borrowed, week
by week.</p>

<p>At harvest time, so the landlord proposes, the rice shall be
divided into two equal piles, one of which shall belong to the
landlord, the other to the tenant. The tenant, from his pile, shall
then pay the landlord one cavan of rice, actually worth from four
to five pesos, for every peso he owes. If he owes one hundred
pesos, he is to pay one hundred cavans.</p>

<p>This bargain sounds quite all right to the poor simple tao, as
long as it is still a matter of theory. But when harvest time comes
and he looks at his actual rice pile, he understands too late the
nature of his agreement. For his pile does not reach one hundred
cavans. To do so, his land would have had to produce two hundred
cavans, which was from the beginning impossible.</p>

<p>So they make a liquidation&mdash;the tao and the
cacique&mdash;after which the tao owes the cacique thirty cavans of
rice. In this new deal the rice is valued at three pesos per
cavan.</p>

<p>Therefore, starting his second year, the tenant owes ninety
pesos, after having paid his landlord seventy cavans at the rate of
one peso per cavan. Next year the same thing will be repeated, to
scale.</p>

<p>Once a tenant contracts a debt to a landlord, he never can
escape.</p>

<p>A man who owes P800 will, in five or six years, owe P30,000.</p>

<p>I quote from record the example of a man who, about nine years
ago, borrowed P90 from a cacique. Having in the interval paid P1400
on the debt, he still owes P1600.</p>

<p>And so, under the &quot;Enslavement Act,&quot; above described,
whole families fall into peonage.</p>

<p>Senator Sandiko dwells also on the personally humiliating
position of the debtor.</p>

<p>&quot;From the moment they incur a debt, the people are
ill-treated and despised. When they go to their creditor&#39;s
house to ask for the advance that the system entails, they are
roughly greeted and made to take a servile place. &#39;You want an
advance?&#39; the cacique will say. &#39;Well, go bring me some
fuel,&#39; or &#39;Go mend my fence,&#39; or &#39;Go chop my
wood.&#39;</p>

<p>&quot;Then, late in the afternoon, after the hungry tao has done
a good day&#39;s work, the cacique gives him perhaps four pesos and
says: &#39;You pay me back five pesos.&#39; And that is the
beginning of a new debt.</p>

<p>&quot;But the political evil is the worst of all. You cannot
have a country part free and part slave. This system assures the
political control of the few. The cacique can always control the
vote of his region. &#39;I will evict you,&#39; he says to his
tenants, &#39;if you don&#39;t vote for my men.&#39;</p>

<p>&quot;And he can do more than that, for the same cacique or
landlord practically selects the Justices of the Peace. Therefore
he orders the Justice of the Peace to punish and to give out
decisions according to his, the cacique&#39;s, will. If a criminal
case is dismissed by the Justice of the Peace, it cannot go up to
the Court of First Instance. Consequently the landlord who escapes
the hands of the Justice of the Peace goes unpunished. And the
Justice of the Peace is usually the landlord&#39;s man.</p>

<p>&quot;In that way, with the machinery of the law in their own
hands, the caciques hold their tenants in an absolute grip.</p>

<p>Before the coming of the United States they used to beat these
people. Now they are sometimes afraid to do that, but they threaten
jail and ruin, and they carry out their threats. In San
Ildefonso,<sup>5</sup> I have seen twenty-five persons jailed on
such pretext, by such means, crowded together in a room so small
that they could not sit down.</p>

<p class="sup"><i><sup>5</sup></i> The neighbourhood of San
Ildefonso, Province of Bulacan, covers a tenantry numbering about
1,000. The Rural Credit went in to give security for the payments
of rent. Whereupon, Provincial Governor Carlos, with the local
caciques, besieged the Philippine Legislature with imperative
demands that the Rural Credit be kept out.</p>

<p>&quot;Public opinion, such little as there is, is controlled by
newspapers that are subsidized by the party in power. So there is
no power to work against those established in wrongdoing. There are
yet only four opposition members in the Senate. Those of the
Filipino people who think, and think independently, have put their
faith and hope in Governor-General Wood as the country&#39;s only
possible salvation. But now Washington has stood by and permitted
him to be reduced to a figurehead by our caciques&mdash;our old
oppressors.</p>

<p>&quot;You Americans should always remember that you are not
guiltless in these matters. The power, and with it the
responsibility, is in your hands.&quot;</p>

<p>Senator Sandiko, as he himself points out, belongs to the
Dem&oacute;crata party&mdash;the opposition. But, in weighing that
fact, it is fair to remember that, under such conditions as now
prevail in the Philippines, it takes an unusually courageous man to
come out in the open in speech, in print and in aggressive action,
attacking the methods of entrenched power against which he would
have no remnant of protection should America leave the Islands.</p>

<p>Mr. Prautch began his championship of the usury-enslaved mass
through the Bureau of Rural Credit in 1916-17. Practically nothing
had been done before in that direction.</p>

<p>The Rural Credit Banks now number 547. They exist in forty-two
provinces, have a membership of 75,600 and a circulating capital of
about P2,500,000. They are not Government concerns, but private
co-operative associations financed by the small farmers themselves
with their own money, the office of the Rural Credit Department
being merely advisory. Wherever these associations are established,
they unveil, to the people, the real nature of their old tyrant,
the cacique, and heavily damage both his fortune and his political
control. For four successive years an enabling act to permit the
extension of the system into farther provinces has been defeated in
Legislature,<sup>6</sup> and Mr. Prautch&#39;s staff of assistants
has been reduced from sixteen to eight&mdash;eight men to cover
forty-two provinces. And yet their effect is felt in a degree.</p>

<p class="sup"><sup>6</sup> It is argued by the enemies of the
system that all this business can be handled either by the
establishment of branches of the National Bank, or else by mail,
from the bank in Manila. But the great need is for banking
facilities in places where business is too small to warrant
establishing a National Bank branch. And to make loans by mail is
either to make them in the dark or to make them on the
recommendation of an inspector whose expenses would make small
loans and collections impossible, while his ignorance of local
characters and conditions would insure his failure to serve the
very men who most need and deserve help. The little local
cooperative bank, the bank in which the whole community are
shareholders, operated under inspection and direction of good Rural
Credit agents, is, so its advocates urge, the practical type for
the place.</p>

<p>&quot;If we of the Rural Credit had not started an attack on
usury, not one man would have had courage to come into court to
make his own complaint,&quot; said one of the Department, speaking
on January 31, 1924. &quot;Our staff, in travelling about the
provinces, explaining by word of mouth, has already awakened a
certain public initiative, and so a number of cases do come to
court. The victims write to us. Before they were simply patient and
took it all as fate. Our law does not penalize the act of requiring
usurious terms of interest. No matter what the document says, if
the debtor has not yet paid the interest exacted by that document,
the usurer cannot be penalized. And it is exceedingly difficult to
prove that usury has been paid, because no usurer will give a
receipt.</p>

<p>&quot;Furthermore, written contracts are rather unusual, and
oral contracts, for all their difficulty of proof, have been
recognized by the courts as binding.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is very difficult to get convictions in usury
cases,&quot; again says a Filipino authority. &quot;Eighty per cent
are lost in court. If victim and usurer are brought face to face,
one powerful, one weak, one with an able lawyer because he can pay
for an able lawyer, the other with a lawyer whom his opponent&#39;s
lawyer has already bought&mdash;why then, the man with influence
and the money is the man who wins.&quot;</p>

<p>Act 2655, the usury law, is not without its good
features&mdash;as, for example, Article 8, which provides that
where loans are to be repaid in agricultural produce, such produce
must be appraised at the current local market price at the time
when the obligation falls due. But a law of words hidden in a book
bears but slightly on the lives and age-old practice of such a
people as are the Filipinos, tao or cacique. Mr. Prautch, examining
the cases of fifty-one complaints against usurious landlords in San
Ildefonso, found that &quot;Article 8,&quot; above cited, was
unknown either to lender or to borrowers, and that no attempt had
ever been made to apply it in any loan on produce made by any one
to any one.</p>

<p>March 13, 1924, I spent in the town of San Fernando, capital of
the Province of Pampangas, in the office of the Provincial
Governor, Olimpio Guanzon.</p>

<p>Mr. Guanzon is a short, stocky, dark-skinned man, a tao by
birth, with little or no sign of mixture in his Malay blood. He has
a square jaw, a direct eye and such an appearance of solid, quiet
sturdiness as makes one stop and think. The occasion was a hearing
of tenants in complaint against their landlords, and Governor
Guanzon had requested Mr. Prautch to come to his aid in bringing
about justice. For Guanzon is one of the few Filipinos who, like
Senator Sandiko, are not afraid to speak and to act openly.</p>

<p>The scene was extremely interesting. The substantial
American-built county-house, which, for design and construction,
might be duplicated in Ohio or in New Jersey; the able-looking
Malay farmer sitting in the big desk chair; at the right Deacon
Prautch in his old white suit, silver-haired, blue-eyed, eager as a
boy, interposing an occasional arrow-like question, sped to its
point by his waving hands; next the lawyer for the complainants,
and then the five complainants themselves, who came as spokesmen
for five hundred tenants against sixty landlords in three
towns.</p>

<p>Studying the five, one found something unexpressibly appealing
in those simple, homely faces, in that humble, decent bearing, in
those toil-gnarled hands. Three were grizzle-headed and wrinkled
deep like walnut shells&mdash;old men. One was middle-aged, one
fairly young. Their clothes were poor and patched, but
clean&mdash;obviously their best. They were bare-foot, all but one.
And all were dark, full-blooded taos.</p>

<p>Their complaint, in substance, ran that for over three years
they had never been able to get a settlement from their landlords,
but had been obliged to accept a running account, &quot;always
favourable&quot; as they said &quot;to the man who keeps the
books.&quot; One landlord, they alleged,&mdash;and produced proof
of their statement,&mdash;a man rich and honoured in the Province,
owner of much sugar land, had made his bargain with his twenty
tenants to take their sugar at P4 the picul.<sup>7</sup> Sugar, at
the time the terms were laid down, was bringing P34 the picul in
the local market, but the tenants, although well aware of this,
were unable to dispute the landlord&#39;s dictum.</p>

<p class="sup"><sup>7</sup>A picul is 140 pounds.</p>

<p>That was in 1920. And they had been unable to get any accounting
from him since. Any of them who had dared to ask too closely about
any question of finance had been evicted, his crop attached through
the court and tied up indefinitely, and himself in every way
persecuted, as an example to others who might contemplate following
his rashness.</p>

<p>One year ago, it is true&mdash;so they went on, first one sombre
voice being raised, then another assuming the tale&mdash;one year
ago, when they had made bold to protest, the Insular Secretary of
Justice had held an investigation and a new agreement was drawn up.
It was not a satisfactory agreement, yet better than the conditions
that they had before. So they, the taos, had acquiesced.</p>

<p>&quot;But the whole thing, in the end, proved only a
farce,&quot; said the oldest of the five. &quot;Before the face of
the Secretary of Justice, Mr. Torres himself, one landlord stated
that he charged fifty per cent interest on his loans; and Mr.
Torres did nothing. He never, indeed, handed down any positive
decision, but simply let the matter hang.&quot;</p>

<p>As for the makeshift new agreement, that had proved to be just
waste paper, no more. There had never been even a pretence at
paying the slightest attention to its terms.</p>

<p>Further, they affirmed:</p>

<p>&quot;The landlords in their &#39;Proprietors&#39; League&#39;
have wielded a deadly instrument against the tao. If one of them
dismisses a tenant, no other member of the League will give him a
chance. And so he is likely to starve.</p>

<p>&quot;Luis Gamboa, one of us, but a bold man, insisted on having
his portion of rice at harvest, according to law. The landlord
promptly dismissed him and now he can get no place to earn his
bread. Luis Gamboa owes that landlord 74 pesos. He has raised a
crop of 168 cavans of rice, of which 84 cavans are rightfully his
own. Rice in the local market was worth ?5 per cavan. His desire
was to deposit 30 cavans to cover his debt. &#39;Not on your
life,&#39; said the landlord. &#39;I take the whole crop&mdash;all
you raised&mdash;every grain. And when I am ready I will hand you
what I think you are fit to spend.&#39; &quot;</p>

<p>Next day Governor Guanzon continued the hearing in the near-by
town of Mexico, as more central to most of the people concerned.
Two hundred and fifty men appeared, of whom twelve were landlords.
The hearing lasted three hours, becoming at times fairly hot. The
previous days&#39; charges were repeated and substantiated afresh
by admissions on the proprietors&#39; part.</p>

<p>A characteristic case was that of Conrado Lorenzo of Mexico, a
land owner who insisted on liquidating the debts and advances of
his fourteen tenant families by taking their rice at P<i>2</i> per
cavan. They objected, pointing out that the market price was then
P5.20 per cavan, and they offered to sell enough of their own rice
to pay him in full in cash. This Lorenzo flatly refused to accept.
The fourteen stood firm. Whereupon Lorenzo went to court, swore out
a complaint of &quot;illegal detention&quot; of his rice, put up a
bond and had the sheriff attach all the rice to hold until the case
should be settled. Which meant that the matter may be considered in
three or six months. During which interval the tenants are left
without one cent for their year&#39;s work in making that
crop&mdash;left penniless, foodless, and under discipline of the
Proprietors&#39; League, to starve. Meantime Lorenzo threatened
eviction&mdash;which threat he probably made good, as such was the
policy pursued by other landlords in the vicinity.</p>

<p>An analysis of the accounts of these fourteen tenants shows up
the facts even more clearly. For example, Alejandro de los Reyes
grew a rice crop of one hundred and three cavans. His half is
fifty-seven cavans. He owes Lorenzo, his landlord, fifteen pesos.
The market price of the rice is PS the cavan. He is willing and
anxious to sell off three or four cavans and pay his debt to
Lorenzo, reserving the right to do what he likes with the balance.
But the landlord insists that he is entitled to <i>all</i> of de
los Reyes&#39;s crop, the full one hundred and three
cavans,&mdash;at P2 per cavan. Of the whole fourteen tenants, half,
it appears, have received only trifling advances; and the worst
indebted is solvent, at market rates. But Lorenzo&#39;s procedure
is uniform.</p>

<p>Where muscovado sugar was the product, the landlords were
seizing their tenants&#39; crops at P6 the cake, the market price
being P16.</p>

<p>At this hearing in the town of Mexico, on March 14, the
proprietors requested Governor Guanzon to call another hearing, for
March 23rd, which was accordingly done. But on the 23rd, although
the number of tenants present&mdash;five hundred&mdash;doubled that
of the previous meeting, not one landlord appeared. They had held a
meeting of their Proprietors&#39; League, in the interval, and had
adopted a policy of refusing flatly to discuss any sort of terms
with the tao tenantry.</p>

<p>The attitude of Governor Guanzon himself, like that of Mr.
Prautch, was one of absolute fairness to both sides, in an endeavor
to prevent open hostility. But Mexico was but one of the many
Pampanga towns so astir. And the outcome looked at best uncertain.
In the Provinces of Tarlac and Bataan the agrarian situation was
fully as bad&mdash;and in that of Bulacan conditions were so much
worse that, making all allowances for the docility of the people,
outbreaks seemed inevitable. In Pampanga, five thousand tenants had
actually organized a Union of their own under the name of <i>Anak
Pawas&mdash;</i>&quot;Sons of Labour.&quot; And the evicting
landlords, in April, 1924, were announcing their intention to fill
the places of Anak Pawas men with non-unionists.</p>

<p>A significant point here lies in the fact that but for the
intervention of the Anglo-Saxon spirit, embodied in Deacon Prautch,
between bully and victim the voice of the victim would scarcely
have been raised.</p>

<p>But, now that we have stirred, here and there, to some embryonic
degree, the dormant spirit of liberty and justice in those nine
millions and more of serfs, the real Filipino people, what is going
to be the result?</p>

<p>&quot;Do you want immediate Independence for the
Philippines?&quot; I asked Governor Guanzon.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do you think that the condition of these poor people, in
whom you take so live an interest, would be bettered if
America&#39;s hand were withdrawn?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, I do,&quot; said the Governor, &quot;and I will tell
you why.&mdash;Because, as long as America remains in the
Philippines she* will keep the people at peace. As long as she
remains here, the tao, who is slowly but steadily gaining in
courage and in character because of the protection and
encouragement that America has given him, will not be allowed to
rise in mobs and settle this thing with his bolo.</p>

<p>&quot;That is why.&quot;</p>

<h2>Chapter V &mdash; VULTURES IN THE SKY</h2>

<p>The potential wealth of the Philippine Islands, like their
present production, is almost exclusively agricultural. But, of the
115,026 square miles total area, only about 10 per cent is under
cultivation, while the country imports in rice, chickens, eggs,
meat, etc., a heavy percentage of the food that it consumes and
could produce.</p>

<p><i>The Philippines Herald,</i> extreme anti-American,
pro-independence organ, thus frankly spoke, in its issue of
February 7, 1924:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>A most convincing array of figures in the statistics
released by the bureau of customs tells the sad tale of...our
position as purchasers of commodities that can easily be produced
here but which we have to import because we lack the grit to raise
locally the things that are essential to our national
well-being...<br>
<br>
The Philippines, an agricultural country of the first order and
with extensive territory adapted to the planting of vegetables and
the raising of live stock, imports chickens, eggs, oranges and
onions from China! And the figures covering the importation of
these food products...show only signs of increasing instead of
falling off.</blockquote>

<p>Several elements contribute to this condition, of which the
parent is still the mortal malady of the land&mdash;caciquism.</p>

<p>The cacique, big or little, like all who follow in his train,
looks down upon the agriculturalist with contempt. The cacique may
own a &quot;plantation,&quot; but, if he does, with a few
honourable exceptions, he works it in the manner indicated in the
preceding chapter&mdash;that is, by peonage. In consequence, labour
is slack, spiritless and poor; or, where a germ of life and
therefore of revolt is astir, it is either headed toward the
dangerous stage, or else it is quitting the Islands.</p>

<p>The recent tao emigration to Hawaii now totals about 40,000. And
it should be remembered that this takes from the cream of the
people. Eighty per cent or more of those now in Hawaii are of the
Ilocano tribe&mdash;thriftiest and most hard-working of all the
Filipinos.</p>

<p>And, although the Filipino is pre-eminently a home-loving being,
he rarely returns from Hawaii after his contract is worked out,
but, with his entire family, remains to settle there. In 1923,
according to thie figures of Acting Director Cruz of the Bureau of
Labour, 7,261 Filipino labourers went to Hawaii, while, during that
period, but 149 returned.</p>

<p>Meantime, much talk is afloat of labour shortage in the Islands,
with many suggestions as to how that shortage shall be supplied.
Much debate goes on about importing a million men from Java and
Sumatra, on the ground that this other Malay stock would mingle
well with the native-born. Some &quot;pol&iacute;ticos&quot;
advocate the expedient of opening the doors to the Chinese and
letting Amoy pour in. Others seriously urge an extension of the
&quot;enslavement&quot; policy to bar the tao&#39;s last door of
escape by the enactment of laws forbidding an emigration that
threatens to rob the cacique of his serf. And these brand the
&quot;able-bodied Filipino working man&quot; who would emigrate as
false to his country.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, propaganda is pushed out among the people to the
effect that Filipino labour in Hawaii is mishandled, hungry and
suffering.</p>

<p>But the idea of bringing forward, as a preventive of emigration,
definite action for just and decent treatment of the 94 per cent by
the 6 per cent seems to have occurred to few.</p>

<p>In his inaugural message to the Sixth Philippine Legislature, on
October 27, 1922, Governor-General Wood found need to say:</p>

<blockquote>It is opportune that we...strive to impress upon all
the people that labor is neither a chattel nor a commodity, but
human, and must be dealt with from the standpoint of human
interests. No amount of legislation can cure all the difficulties
which arise between those who work and those who employ them. In
the last analysis it is a case of doing with others as you would
have them do unto you...Those who employ others must demonstrate a
keen human interest in their welfare if they would have cheerful
and loyal service in return.</blockquote>

<p>But words such as these mean nothing at all in the ears of
Tomasa&#39;s Fiscal, in the ears of Pedro Abad, in the ears of the
Proprietors&#39; League in Pampanga and the sister provinces.</p>

<p>The typical cacique is not a farmer. Non-productive himself, he
confronts a real necessity of controlling the production of
somebody who works. The customary way is to hold land and let it
out to tenants, under the &quot;peonage&quot; or
&quot;enslavement&quot; act whose operation we have already seen.
There is, however, another aspect of the same subject:</p>

<p>The Public Land Act of the U. S. Philippine Commission went into
effect in 1904. It was a good law<i><sup>1</sup></i> and made
liberal provision for the would-be small landowner. But, says Dean
C. Worcester,<sup>2</sup> then Secretary of the Interior of the
Insular Government:</p>

<p class="sup"><sup>1</sup> No. 926.</p>

<p class="sup"><sup>2</sup> Dean C. Worcester, <i>The Philippines
Past and Present,</i> New York, 1921, pp. 830-1.</p>

<blockquote>...Neither Congress nor the Commission reckoned with
the ignorance of the common people nor with the opposition to the
acquisition of land by poor Filipinos...on the part of their richer
and more intelligent fellow-countrymen...The cacique does not wish
his laborers to acquire land in their own right, for he well knows
that if they did so they would become self-supporting, and it would
cease to be possible for him to hold them as peons, as is commonly
done at present. Serious obstacles are therefore frequently thrown
in the way of poor people who desire to become owners of land, and
if this does not suffice, actual opposition is often made by
municipal officers or other influential Filipinos, who claim as
their own private property land which poor men are trying to
get.</blockquote>

<p>Mr. Worcester&#39;s statement was written to cover the period
from the promulgation of the Act, July 26, 1904, to the date of his
finished writing, 1914. It remains true to-day.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, during that first decade, over 19,000 families,
nearly all of the energetic Ilocano tribe, came pouring from their
own over-crowded provinces to take up homesteads in public domain
according to the provisions of the Act. The local authorities
welcomed them, being eager to have the territory developed. Certain
enthusiastic Americans helped them to choose their land, to file
their application and to perfect their titles. The Bureau of Lands,
at that time an organization honestly and effectively operating as
custodian of public domain, did its part well. In the province of
Nueva Ecija strings of communities sprang up and the population and
the rice production soared together.</p>

<p>This went on for ten years. Then, in 1913, came Mr. Wilson&#39;s
accession to the Presidency, and with it a sudden change of
America&#39;s administrative plan, making for rapid shifting of
Governmental control into native hands.</p>

<p>The Bureau of Lands felt the effect promptly. The American
Director of Lands, known as one of the most efficient men in the
Insular service, was removed in favour of a young cacique, himself
a large landowner of Nueva Ecija. This man was entrusted with the
administration of a vast public property, including $7,000,000
worth of Friars Land, and with the Government&#39;s business with a
growing multitude of settlers.</p>

<p>That business now rapidly became entangled. Ugly rumours of land
scandals gathered thick and fast about the new director&#39;s name,
and before long he resigned his post.</p>

<p>But the damage was already done. The cacique Director had
quickly disembarrassed himself of the old experienced men of the
Land Bureau&mdash;American graduate civil engineers who had passed
the United States Civil Service examination before coming to the
Islands. Swarming parientes, clerks and hangers-on soon clogged the
machinery of the Central Office. &quot;To reduce expenses,&quot;
educational requirements were lowered to native High School grade,
and the new-type inspector rarely bestirred himself to check the
applicant homesteaders&#39; papers with the land itself, but sat at
ease in some central barrio, recommending the petition of the man
most liberal with his cash.</p>

<p>Each division of the Bureau, it is alleged by many credible
observers, now undid the work of the rest, one granting homestead
rights many times over to as many different applicants for the same
parcel, while another ran survey lines around already occupied
tracts but, on the maps that it drew, made no signs of
settlers&#39; work and presence. Then also, it is stated, came
canny persons blessed with &quot;friends at
court&quot;&mdash;private claimants presenting with their
applications for title privately-drawn plans that showed no
evidence of the man who had for years lived on and cultivated the
sections they desired.</p>

<p>In such cases, the homesteader lost his land by default. For
what had he but his work and his miserable self to show as proof
that he existed? And a tao has no rights that a rich man is bound
to respect.</p>

<p>Then, as a forward step in autonomy, they abolished the Court of
Land Registration, transferring land cases to the safe abyss of the
Courts of First Instance, which, themselves now autonomized, were
buried almost to a standstill in untouched work. And so it
progressed, from confusion to stark madness, until the central
office at last hit upon the expedient of approving everything that
came in, pocketing the fees and leaving the settlers themselves to
work out their own titles and boundary lines on the spot, by the
rule of bolo and of gun.</p>

<p>As for the cash paid in, strange fates befell it, of which, all
things considered, perhaps the strangest was discovered by Deacon
Prautch when, in his prowlings, he one day found snugly couched in
a Bureau of Lands safe the sum of over P22,000, bare of any record
of origin. This eventually proved to be an accumulation of annual
payments from thousands of poor homesteaders whose remittances had
never been recorded, and who, in many a case, would surely be
evicted from their lands on score of non-payment of dues.</p>

<p>For some five years this practice served. Then the Legislature,
itself composed chiefly of caciques and the lawyers of caciques,
decided that better yet might be done for cacique purses. So it
passed a new land act, No. 2874.</p>

<p>Whatever its real or alleged purpose, the effect of the new law,
as far as homesteading is concerned, is to cancel past gains, to
wipe out present claims, and to destroy the future chances of the
poor Filipino who would own his own home and escape slavery. It
substitutes for a clear land title a concession with
restrictions&mdash;a trap that would break the heart of any poor
man possessing understanding to see the threat it veils.</p>

<p>But the tao has not that understanding until experience bestows
it upon him too late. The law is a cacique&#39;s law, framed in the
cacique&#39;s favour.</p>

<p>Having passed the Philippine Legislature, and in default of any
intervention by Washington, this measure became, on April 7, 1919,
law of the Philippine Islands.</p>

<p>The bars of the public domain now went down with a clatter and a
bang, and the land-hogs ran wild all over the place.</p>

<p>The case of Blas Ramos would not have become as widely known as
it is had it not, in many of its features, been typical.</p>

<p>Blas Ramos, Ilocano, was a tao tenant&mdash;a common peasant
&mdash;of the Province of Tarlac. Growing restive under his
landlord&#39;s increased exactions, he decided one day to be
forever quit of them. He would turn pioneer adventurer. He would
trek up into the wild lands of Nueva Ecija, whither, for some years
now, his brother Ilocanos had been moving.</p>

<p>So he wove a palm-leaf cover to his bull-cart, strapped his rice
basket and his cook-pot at its back, put his wife and two children
inside, harnessed his carabao between the shafts and started.</p>

<p>Each noontide the family spent under the cart, eating and
sleeping, while the carabao lay in the nearest pool, up to his good
old chin in mud and water. Each night the family slept in the cart,
the cover tight closed to keep out imps, while the carabao grazed
nearby. On through Guimba they moved; on again, to the wild
uncultivated lands. And there, after some days jungle-scouting,
Blas Ramos picked out a plot, giving wide berth to all privately
owned land.</p>

ILOCANOS EMIGRATING TO THE CAGAYAN VALLEY<br>

<br>
THE EMIGRANTS&#39; NOONING<br>
M. M. Newell</p>

<p>Then he cleared a spot, put up the frail little shack that was
to be his home, and so was ready, when the first rains came, to
break a part of the tough-skinned open grass-land for upland rice.
Also, he cleared a further bit of jungle and planted it to
<i>camotes</i> and beans. Later, so he planned, he would dig a
canal to irrigate his property. But one pair of hands could not get
so far so soon. This was in 1914.</p>

<p>But his choice of land proved rather a poor one. The soil was
lean and his first year&#39;s labour ended in crop failure. Next
season came a drought. After which a silver cloud of locusts,
glittering down upon his fields, devoured the little growing stuff
that the drought had spared. Not until the third year had Blas a
harvest that would pay his living expenses and leave a bit to lay
by toward buying another carabao. For one carabao can cultivate
only three hectares of ground.</p>

<p>Still, he was contented, for he knew that in the long run he
could make a decent living.</p>

<p>And then came two good years, with good crops.</p>

<p>Meantime, men moved about and abroad in the land like vultures
circling in the sky&mdash;watching, watching, picking out prey.
After Blas Ramos&#39;s second good crop, the watchers set a mark
against his name.</p>

<p>And so, one day in May, when Blas toiled in the field busy with
his ploughing, a prosperous-looking stranger came striding down
upon him wearing a black face.</p>

<p>&quot;What are you about here?&quot; demanded the stranger,
truculently.</p>

<p>&quot;Ploughing my field for early rice,&quot; rejoined Blas,
mildly surprised.</p>

<p><i>&quot;Your</i> field!&quot; shouted the stranger.
<i>&quot;My</i> field you mean. You are ploughing <i>my</i> field,
you scoundrel. I have bought it and I come to take possession of my
land. Here is my title, look!&quot;&mdash;and he brandished a paper
that might have been anything, or nothing, or what he said, for
Blas can not read.</p>

<p>Blas knew, all the same, that the man was a fraud. And courage
surged up in him from the feel of his own true ground under his two
bare feet.</p>

<p>&quot;I do not believe in your title,&quot; said he. &quot;And I
don&#39;t know you. I have been here five years as a homesteader. I
got the land from the Government. My wife and I have suffered many
hardships to make the place. Now it is our home, and we shall keep
it.&quot;</p>

<p>The stranger was evidently somewhat perplexed at the failure of
his attack. A tao, unsupported, will not often defy a superior to
his face.</p>

<p>&quot;I advise you,&quot; he said, &quot;to get out peaceably.
The land is mine and if necessary I shall take it by force. For
which you will be sorry.&quot;</p>

<p>With that he departed, while Blas turned back to guide his
carabao before his little old home-made wooden plough.</p>

<p>Nothing happened, after that, till early July, when the upland
rice was sprouting, beautiful to see. Then, in the cool of a
morning, several men arrived with ploughs and carabaos, marched
straight into the field, and began to plough up the newly-sprouted
grain.</p>

<p>Rushing out to defend his property, Blas found that he who
directed the destruction was his visitor of the previous May.</p>

<p>&quot;Stand back!&quot; shouted this personage. &quot;I am
Manuel Valerio, owner of this land. Stand back, or I and my men
will skin you alive.&quot;</p>

<p>One against so many, Blas gave up the attempt and went off to
his shack to think. Having thought, he betook himself to a friend
who could write. Between them, labouring heavily, they concocted
and sent a letter to the Director of the Bureau of Lands, stating
the case and asking redress.</p>

<p>The Director of Lands, it was said, wrote a letter, in turn, to
Manuel Valerio, the cacique, calling upon him to desist from
troubling Blas Ramos, the tao.</p>

<p>If such a letter was written it had no visible effect.</p>

<p>Harvest time came. Valerio&#39;s men had replanted the land
whose first crop they destroyed, but that second crop was poor.
Blas&#39;s other fields, however, came on with a heavy yield. But
just as the harvest asked for the sickle, Blas Ramos fell ill, so
that his wife, and other women, her friends, went out in his stead
to cut the grain.&mdash;Which seeing, in a towering rage came
Valerio and beat the woman, driving her away with curses and blows
of his stick. And she, with welts still rising on her body, ran on
to the presidencia of Mu&ntilde;oz, the nearest available hope.</p>

<p>&quot;You can file a complaint,&quot; said the Mu&ntilde;oz
police, without interest. &quot;But nothing can be done. The Judge
and the Presidente are away.&quot;</p>

<p>Meantime, while the woman prayed for help where help there was
none, while the man lay on his mat, sick of a fever, unable to lift
his head, Manuel Valerio&#39;s labourers were busily harvesting the
entire product of the little farm&mdash;about 383 bushels of rice
in all.</p>

<p>Having harvested it, they loaded it into their bull-carts and
took it away, nor left one single cavan behind to save the little
family from starving.</p>

<p>Then, within a few days, Valerio and two policemen appeared from
the nearby town of Talavera bearing a warrant for Blas&#39;s
arrest. The charge was robbery, in that Blas, months before, had
gathered some early rice&mdash;the first fruits of his own
sowing&mdash;and, with his family, had eaten it. So he was thrown
into jail, and, the Justice of the Peace refusing him an
opportunity to secure bail, in jail Blas staid for forty-eight
hours.</p>

<p>Meantime, making use of the opportunity thus secured, Valerio
betook himself to his victim&#39;s little grass home, drove out the
wife and children, smashed the pots and dishes, carried off the
trunk that held all the family&#39;s clothing and little valuables
and destroyed the shack.</p>

<p>Blas therefore, coming back from jail, had first to hunt up his
refugee and homeless family and then to decide some difficult
questions.</p>

<p>To start over again in a new place, and repeat the labours of
the past five years of pioneer work? No. To give up the unequal
struggle for freedom and become a peon again, like the rest of the
Filipino millions? <i>No.</i> He had tasted freedom. The place he
had worked for was his home. It was dearer than any slave&#39;s
life. He would go back and defend it, cost what it might.</p>

<p>The good little wife and the children came with him. They cut
cogan grass and rebuilt the shack. They borrowed a cook-pot and
began life anew.</p>

<p>Valerio was furious at the tao&#39;s persistence. Repairing to
his friend, the Justice of the Peace of Talavera, he laid new
charges against Blas&mdash;this time for arson, as having burned a
house&mdash;a house which never existed. Then, in the haste of his
wrath, he addressed himself to quicker methods.</p>

<p>Blas and his family were sitting in their shack around the
dinner pot, one noon in May (1919), when up the crackling ladder
came Manuel Valerio, followed by two men with bolos in their
grip.</p>

<p>&quot;Get out of this house and off this farm,&quot; shouted
Valerio, &quot;and be done with you, once for all. You show your
face here again on peril of your life.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I will not,&quot; declared Blas, &quot;this is my own home
and I will defend it with my life.&quot;</p>

<p>So, at a sign from Valerio, the two with bolos seized the tao,
and, before his wife&#39;s eyes, first beat him with the flat of
their blades and then bound him hand and foot. Which having done,
they ran a long stick through his thongs and carried him, swung
like a trussed pig, off and away into the open prairie. Here, under
the fierce straight sun, they staked him out, arms and legs
stretched wide, bending his head back sharp and tying it by the
neck in such a way that the full glare of the sun must beat into
his eyes. With a final kick they left him so.</p>

<p>&quot;We shall see,&quot; said Valerio, &quot;what the sun can
do to melt the will of a stubborn tao. If it is not enough, there
are other methods, remember, such as we used in the
Insurrection...&quot;</p>

<p>Some hours later two other homesteaders, Mariano Taroma and Leon
Antolin, old men, returning from the jungle where they had gone to
cut wood, found him lying there just as his tormenters left him,
but unconscious.</p>

<p>They loosed his bonds and gradually worked him back to life. And
when they had heard all, they counselled together. Then Mariano
spoke:</p>

<p>&quot;We Ilocanos have met the drought, the locusts, the
typhoons and the rinderpest, and we have survived them all. And now
comes an enemy crueller than these&mdash;the land-grabber, who has
behind him all the cacique&#39;s power. We must do our best. Stick
to your claim, Blas. If you loose, we shall all loose. We will each
give rice for you and yours so you shall not starve.&quot;</p>

<p>And then one came forward with the offer of room in his shack
until better times should arrive. And Blas, daring no longer to
remain on his ground, took his family to that friendly refuge.
Whereupon Manuel Valerio withdrew the two criminal charges lodged
against Blas before the Justice of Talavera, although no action had
yet been taken upon either one, and, seizing the long-coveted land,
cultivated for his own benefit the fields that had been made easy
and sleek and rich by the labour of the now homeless tao and his
little family.</p>

<p>Meantime, accompanied by the two old men, his rescuers, who
boldly volunteered to serve as witnesses, Blas repaired to the
Justice of the Peace of Mu&ntilde;oz and filed a complaint. The
Judge appointed a date of trial. When that date arrived Blas and
his two old friends duly appeared, but Manuel Valerio made no
sign.</p>

<p>Six times was this thing repeated, the Judge renaming a trial
date, the accused ignoring the summons, the three taos regularly
obeying, then wearily trudging home again, mocked and unsatisfied,
to their own neglected work. Finally, after the sixth postponement,
one Nicolas Garcia, notary, hanger-on of the court, and friend of
Valerio, came to Blas saying:</p>

<p>&quot;If you will take me for your counsel, and pay me thirty
pesos, you will be sure to win, because the Judge is my
nephew.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But there has been no investigation of my case,&quot;
protested Blas.</p>

<p>&quot;That doesn&#39;t matter. Give me the money and see,&quot;
said the other.</p>

<p>And so, &quot;because I wanted the matter to be settled,&quot;
says Blas, &quot;I paid him ten pesos and asked him to let the rest
remain as my debt. After all this the case was
dismissed&mdash;according to the judge for lack of evidence, though
I was not yet investigated.&quot;</p>

<p>Blas continues his statement in an affidavit dated Nov. 4, 1921,
on file in the Bureau of Lands, Manila. He says:</p>

<blockquote>In the month of September, 1921, the Judge called for
me. He said that I was called by him because he feared that I might
state other things in case the fiscal would investigate my case. He
ordered me that in case the fiscal would ask why my complaint came
to nothing, I would then say that I myself was at fault, for not
having brought witnesses, but I did not argue with him. Then he
told me again that my case would not have any result. From that
time till now nothing has been done, except the investigation
conducted by the fiscal, who told me that I would &quot;just have
to wait for the clemency of the authorities&quot;; but until the
present time I have waited for nothing.</blockquote>

<p>Ten months passed before that waiting brought forth fruit other
than &quot;nothing.&quot; Then, on Sept. 14, 1922, the Fiscal
(Prosecuting Attorney) of the Province filed a complaint in the
Provincial Court of First Instance against Manuel Valerio and his
two aides in the staking-out affair, charging <i>homicidio
frustrado&mdash;</i>or balked homicide.</p>

<p>The case came to trial on April 18, 1923. An attorney called
Hermogenes Concepcion,<sup>3</sup> defending Valerio, then simply
stated that Valerio, on the occasion in question, had no intention
of killing Blas Ramos and that no man can be &quot;balked&quot; in
an intent he has not harboured.</p>

<p class="sup"><sup>3</sup> Dem&oacute;crata member of the
Philippine Legislature of 1923-24.</p>

<p>Upon these grounds, one month later, the Judge handed down a
decision dismissing the case. He added, however, that the evidence
sufficed to show that Valerio had committed the crime of
&quot;coercion&quot; and ordered that such a charge be filed.</p>

<p>This new case being tried, Attorney Concepci&oacute;n again
requested dismissal on ground of double jeopardy and obtained for
his client the verdict that he asked.</p>

<p>Blas Ramos&#39;s pluck had by this time won him friends among
the handful of Americans in Nueva Ecija who backed him sturdily and
who enlisted for him the invaluable attention of Mr. R. McCulloch
Dick, editor of one of the most deservedly influential journals in
the Philippines.</p>

<p>Mr. Dick&#39;s paper, the <i>Philippines Free Press,</i> now
gave to Blas&#39;s woes more publicity than was pleasant to the
officials responsible. For Blas&#39;s story was an utter
commonplace in every respect save his own grit.</p>

<p>By hundreds, all over the homestead territory, the men who, with
the labour of years, had beaten wild land into service and made it
fruitful were being dispossessed. And the Bureau of Lands,
nominally in charge of the public domain, was a helpless and
unhonoured mess.</p>

<p>Such was the situation when the Wood-Forbes Commission arrived
in 1921. The news of its coming spread in the land as a beam of
hope for the exploited poor. To it the pluckiest of the defrauded
taos now repaired in search of redress, Blas with the rest.</p>

<p>The Commission sent out an investigator to look into the facts.
The investigator, returning, reported that Blas and the others had
understated their case. As a result, a number of officials were
dismissed, a Provincial fiscal was transferred, judges were
delegated to open special courts for land cases, special
prosecuting attorneys were detailed to handle criminal business,
the Land Bureau people were requested to make organized effort to
settle land disputes, and things, on the whole, began to look like
the dawn of a better day.</p>

<p>But the land-grabbers were cunning and well dug-in. Their power,
influence and means, compared with those of the homesteading tao
and the Government agent, were overwhelming. Besides which, they
had already taken good care who occupied Government places. Killing
expenses, killing delays attended the working out of the
Commission&#39;s charges, most of which died a lingering death in
the course of circular tours from office to office. Government
witnesses were frightened into silence. And the new Land Courts, so
hopefully meant, often merely presented the land-grabbers with a
new avenue to their own ends.</p>

<p>Through able use of this machine Blas Ramos&#39;s land was now
actually decreed to Manuel Valerio, Blas himself getting never a
hearing. Luckily, however, Blas&#39;s American friends learned of
the move before it was too late to act. The case was gallantly
fought until the Supreme Court at last confirmed the much-enduring
tao in possession of his little homestead.</p>

<p>After this decision, Blas Ramos, returned to his labour,
patiently ploughed and planted anew. And while he toiled, came one
Manuel Valerio, walking over the fields to say:</p>

<p>&quot;Go ahead. I like to see your industry. When the crop is
ripe, I, as usual, will harvest it.&quot;</p>

<p>This was in the summer of 1923. In November of the year, Valerio
made good his word. Blas resisted. A bolo fight ensued, in which
Valerio was seriously hurt. At the date of my last information,
January, 1924, Blas was reported still in jail, awaiting trial for
defending the property to which the Supreme Court of the land had
finally confirmed his title.</p>

<p>No one disputes that the economic future of the Islands as a
self-sustaining country rests on the ability of the people really
to establish themselves on the land and to work it.</p>

<br>
CARABAO CALVES THRESHING RICE<br>
M. M. Newell</p>

<p>No one disputes that rice is the one staple food of the
Islands&mdash;its life&#39;s prime necessity. No one can dispute
that the annual rice crop is the fruit, never of great
planters&#39; investments, but always of the aggregate efforts of
the poor. And yet, thanks to Law No. 2874 and the spirit that bred
it, tens of thousands of poor men&#39;s title-cases to-day await
adjustment, the once-good Land Office, crippled in men, money and
equipment, is years behind its work, and the all-important
cadastral survey, to put its case in a single word, is
hamstrung.</p>

<p>The attitude of the autonomized Philippine Government on such
matters, and the degree of responsibility that it accepts, may most
authoritatively be gathered from a statement of the Director of the
Bureau of Lands, Mr. Jorge B. Vargas himself, made public in
August, 1923:</p>

<blockquote>It is true that the officers and agents of the Bureau
of Lands are now vested with police authority over the...public
lands...[but] it should be remembered...that Blas Ramos is one only
of a large number of public land applicants, of which there were in
the first of the month 22,591 in Nueva Ecija alone, and a total of
137,554 throughout the Philippine Islands. If the Bureau of Lands
is expected to give police protection to all these applicants
against encroachments of so-called land-grabbers...who may be
minded to take the law into their own hands...it will be obviously
necessary to place guards on the lots applied for by these 137,000
applicants, a requirement which is absurdly impossible for the
Government of the Philippine Islands, let alone the Bureau of Lands
to meet.</blockquote>

<h2>Chapter VI &mdash; THE SPIRIT OF &#39;76</h2>

<p>The Province of Nueva Ecija is probably the best rice country in
the Philippines. With full utilization of its natural water
resources, it could double its present production. Some score of
sizable rivers run unutilized in the Province to-day, of which the
Talavera alone could irrigate, if put in complete harness, 10,000
hectares of rice land.</p>

<p>These facts, some seven years ago, set Kilmer Moe, American
Superintendent of Mu&ntilde;oz Agricultural School, to thinking.
For almost all the small streams in the then homestead country had
already been used, and if more land was to be profitably cultivated
more water was essential. Mr. Moe, attacking the problem
single-handed, made the preliminary studies and worked out a
plan.</p>

<p>No sooner did Mr. Moe reveal his scheme, however, than
resistance confronted him. The people knew nothing of river
control&mdash;had never seen it. Therefore the professional
troublemaker found in the very words an opportunity.</p>

<p>&quot;Again these terrible American exploiters are after our
fair Philippines!&quot; they told the open-mouthed taos. &quot;They
want them for their Trusts. Trusts are bands of devil-monsters that
first seize the people&#39;s property and then eat the people up.
Now they plan to charm this river and make it rush out of its bed,
destroy all in its path and cover the whole of central Luzon deep
with dry stones.</p>

<p>&quot;Then none of you can raise rice, ever again, and you all
will starve.</p>

<p>&quot;But <i>I</i> will defend you! Give me, then, your name on
this petition. I will write your name and you will make your
mark.</p>

<p>&quot;Give me, also, fifty pesos, paying down what you have, and
holding the rest as a loan from me till you pay all. When all the
barrio people have done this, I will take the paper and carry it to
Governor-General Harrison and beg him, for you, that he forbid the
wicked American to commit such a crime.&quot;</p>

<p>So the people signed. And in this way one &quot;politico&quot;
alone, it is affirmed, was enabled to hold back the irrigation work
for eighteen months, pending &quot;investigation and
report.&quot;</p>

<p>However, in the end the wicked American wore delays and
opposition down. Living with the thing day and night, he got the
money released, got a good engineer appointed and, as soon as the
cadastral survey was completed, saw to it that the land to be
redeemed was fairly portioned out.</p>

<p>Then the engineer, another American, Mr. Baughman, pushed
forward the work. At last the dam was done. The head-gates, flumes
and syphons were finished. The canals, the intake also; and the
power site, where the channel takes a fifty-foot drop, giving power
enough to mill the whole crop of the valley. All these parts and
more also had been completed, and about half the entire scheme was
in active operation by early 1923.</p>

<p>Only simple routine tasks, such as could easily be finished in
advance of that current agricultural year,&mdash;that is, by July,
1923, remained to be done in order to round out the system.
Feeling, therefore, that his real work here was accomplished, Mr.
Baughman now stepped aside in favour of a Filipino Government
engineer.</p>

<p>In March, 1924&mdash;eight months later&mdash;the only farmers
of that new region who had irrigation water to grow rice were those
to whom Mr. Baughman, before he resigned the reins, had already
delivered it.</p>

<p>Yet, in this case, as in many a similar one in other fields, no
real lack of good will should be assumed, but rather, passivity,
lack of initiative, of energy, and of power of applying
book-learning to practical problems.</p>

<p>The first attitude of the average Filipino toward new
constructive projects is an inclination to place every difficulty
in their way. Then, when the project nevertheless begins to operate
and he sees that it is good, he says in effect:</p>

<p>&quot;This looks easy. I will take it over&mdash;and with it,
the credit.&quot;</p>

<p>Which having done, he hands it on to some pariente office boy,
and himself returns to his steady business of
&quot;politics.&quot;</p>

<p>The Province of Nueva Ecija now produces annually well over
8,000,000 bushels of rice, main food of the Islands, and, were its
resources properly handled, could easily double that production.
The Talavera Irrigation Project, even in its present partial
development, has added many times its cost to the value of the
lands irrigated. But the Philippine Islands in the calendar year of
1923 imported about 2,462,000 bushels of rice, valued at
$3,706,431&mdash;a very serious outflow of cash from a poor country
in vital need of development.</p>

<p>Much as one may deprecate saying it, no examination of the facts
to-day will discredit the general statement that whatever has been
done for the advancement of the Filipino people in the last quarter
century has been done by America, Americans and Filipinos under
American guidance. Whatever has been done to their harm, loss and
oppression has been done by the Filipino himself, unguided.</p>

<p>The American frontiersman would laugh at the idea of himself as
an altruist. But many of the pictures in which you persistently
find him an actor tell their own tale. And once and again, out of
the Malay mass a figure appears that doubly weds him to his fate;
some simple, uncontaminated tao, showing, against oppressors
incomparably worse than was ever that poor mad old German, King
George the Third, our very own Spirit of &#39;76. Blas Ramos is one
of these.</p>

<p>As for Diego Tecson,<sup>1</sup> perhaps he was sent into this
world for the special encouragement of such as would grow
faint-hearted as to the people for whom he stands. I personally
know the man and his story. I have sat in his house and eaten his
salt.</p>

<p class="sup"><sup>1</sup> The name is here changed for his
protection. But the narrative in no other way departs from
fact.</p>

<p>Diego Tecson was the son of a poor tao. He may be fifty-three or
-four years old by now. In the Spanish days before we came, he
somehow got a scrap of learning&mdash;got it against all odds, as
men will everywhere, when the spirit wills.</p>

<p>Then, in 1902, American schools having opened, Diego began the
identical process by which so many of our own best men have worked
their upward way. He first earned a bit of money, then went to
school for a few months of desperate grind, telescoping grades as
fast as he could while the coin would last to keep him alive. Again
and yet again he repeated the process. Until, when he had conquered
a kind of English, he was offered, as &quot;temporary
teacher,&quot; a salary of seven dollars and a half a month. Out of
this he lived and saved until he had accumulated fifty dollars.</p>

<p>Then he went for a year to the High School of his Province,
allowing himself five dollars monthly&mdash;four dollars and a half
for board, fifty cents for laundry, pencils, etc. At the end of
each month just five cents remained out of his self-allotted
dole.</p>

<p>And so he went on, first teaching for pay, saving every copper
he could spare, then studying at the high school, spending never a
copper he could save.</p>

<p>Until, in 1906, Diego&#39;s father intervened. &quot;I want you
to marry, my son,&quot; said he. &quot;You have studied enough. Now
you shall settle down to steady teaching. And when you have laid by
sufficient money you and I will go homesteading, according to this
new American law. Then we shall live as free men, and your children
will grow up unafraid, in prosperity.&quot;</p>

<p>So Diego married&mdash;married a good, wise girl who had also
some schooling from the Americans. And then he took his little wife
and went away up to the borders of the New Country to teach public
school.</p>

<p>They carried with them all their worldly goods. Here is the
list:</p>

<p>1 bowl<br>
2 spoons<br>
1 fork<br>
3 plates<br>
2 blankets<br>
50 centavos (twenty-five cents)<br>
1/2 sack of hulled rice<br>
2 chicks</p>

<p>As to the people of the barrio to which he was sent, a teacher
was a thing without meaning in their ears.</p>

<p>They lived as their ancestors had lived for centuries. They were
poor. Thirteen carabao constituted the cultivating power of the
community and these, almost all, belonged to the cacique, a hard
man who never failed to squeeze out the last ounce of service, the
last copper in levy, that his victim could yield.</p>

<p>So the people had learned, long ago, the uselessness of
industry. Why should they labour and lay by just for their cacique,
when all was done, to come and strip them bare? Since they must go
hungry anyway, like masterless dogs, why not enjoy the compensation
of dogs and lie about in the sun?</p>

<p>So they lay about in the sun, scarcely disturbing a soil whose
fruits, had they laboured to plant them, would have been snatched
from their lips.</p>

<p>&quot;Study!&quot; they repeated, after Diego. &quot;Send our
children to school? Why?&mdash;Wherefore? Don&#39;t waste your time
on foolishness. Come along hunting with us. That is the only thing
worth stirring for. By and by we are going to get up and go into
the forest after deer and wild hogs. Then we shall eat.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sell me some rice to eat,&quot; Diego would rejoin.
&quot;I have work to do. I haven&#39;t time to hunt.&quot;</p>

<p>But they did not want to sell him rice, of which they had so
little themselves that they ate but once a day.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, at odd hours Diego was building his house&mdash;four
twelve-foot posts in the ground, a slight floor frame, a bamboo
skeleton, and for roof and walls a covering of screen-like mats of
woven palm. And when his rice basket was nearly bare, he would
trudge some eight miles to the nearest rice-growers, and, if he was
lucky, bring home a back-load. Then in the evenings after work was
done, he and his wife would pound out the kernels for next
day&#39;s food.</p>

<p>And all the time Diego&#39;s main occupation was the ensnaring
of pupils, one by one, and the teaching of his school. By the end
of two months&#39; work he had two hundred and fifty regular
pupils, barrio children all. And these were studying in a clean and
decent house, surrounded by a well-kept garden which itself was
neatly fenced the whole way round&mdash;the entire establishment
being an object lesson to the dirty ragged barrio.</p>

<p>&quot;What&#39;s all this!&quot; exclaimed the District
Supervisor, an American, appearing on inspection. &quot;Bless my
soul&mdash;all this in two months&#39; time? But, look
here:&mdash;two hundred and fifty scholars is too many for one man
to teach. How about your wife, Diego? Could she help?&quot;</p>

<p>They tried her. She could. So the wife was put on salary
&mdash;seven dollars and a half monthly. And now the two together
made fifteen dollars a month&mdash;much money&mdash;of which they
saved just half because they bought little but the rice which Diego
pounded out in the evenings. And Diego, little by little, grew in
the barrio&#39;s esteem.</p>

<p>After a while the Supervisor made another discovery.
&quot;Diego,&quot; said he, &quot;you can handle more than this
school. You could run a homestead as well. Go get one.&quot;</p>

<p>So Diego, remembering also his father&#39;s desires, went to an
American known throughout the New Country for his justice and
friendship toward taos and for his knowledge of the rice lands, and
said:</p>

<p>&quot;Sir, I would like to have a homestead. Will you help me to
choose good land and to get clear title?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sure,&quot; said the American; and it was so.</p>

<p>By 1907 planting time, thanks to his new friend, Diego had his
land. So then he took his savings and invested them in power in the
shape of a female carabao. And he engaged a man to direct the daily
energies of that dynamo of hope.</p>

<p>In those days there was no irrigation thereabout. So the crop
must depend on the rains. As for drinking water, Diego carried it
from the nearest settlement, two miles away. And whenever he could
properly leave school, he trudged over to see his land, his
planting, his carabao and him who walked in her footsteps. And,
since there was much clearing to do &mdash;much heavy warfare with
cogan grass and vainglorious weeds&mdash;Diego worked on that job,
too, in every moment he could spare.</p>

<p>But the season of 1907 was not kind. It was, on the contrary,
cruelly dry. And Diego, in lieu of the four hundred bushels of rice
he had expected to harvest, got only seventeen bushels&mdash;not
one-fourth of his investment.</p>

<p>&quot;Diego,&quot; said the wife, &quot;you must give it up.
This thing is too dangerous. You will spend all our savings on your
folly.&quot;</p>

<p>Diego almost yielded, for the Filipino barkens to his wife in
matters of family finance. Yet for once he stiffened his back.</p>

<p>&quot;Just give me one more chance,&quot; he urged. And at last
she consented to let him continue his experiment for one year
more.</p>

<p>Then he and his wife lived on one meal a day, and he bought more
seed with the money they saved, and when the time came, he planted
afresh. And the fruit thereof, in 1908, was one hundred bushels of
beautiful rice. Which meant food for all the coming year, till next
rice harvest&mdash;food for Diego and for his wife and for their
hired hand as well.</p>

<p>&quot;This,&quot; said his wife, &quot;is real business. I
cannot leave it to men. I shall now resign teaching and go and live
on Our Farm.&quot;</p>

<p>So she did. Diego, however, keeping his feet on the ground in
more senses than one, went on teaching and saving his pay. But
every Friday night he set off for his homestead, and every Saturday
he cleared land.</p>

<p>Next year&mdash;1909&mdash;he took on two men, with their aid
dug irrigation ditches and harvested two hundred and sixteen
bushels of rice.</p>

<p>Said his wife: &quot;I am glad of our farm. I will give you,
now, more of our savings to invest in this thing, which
pays.&quot;</p>

<p>Then, in 1910, communal irrigation came in by the getting
together of homesteading taos, under the American&#39;s lead, to
make use of small streams in the district. That year Diego
harvested a full thousand bushels.</p>

<p>Said the wife: &quot;It is now best, Diego, that you give up
teaching altogether and devote all your time to this really
excellent farm.&quot;</p>

<p>And at the same time the Bureau of Lands, being then alive on
the job, informed him that, to keep his holdings, he must now take
up residence thereon.</p>

<p>Diego complied. In 1911 he lived on his land and worked it with
seven helpers. This extra labour, plus irrigation, provided a crop
of thirty-eight hundred bushels.</p>

<p>Each year thereafter Diego&#39;s prosperity increased. With
steadily growing capital, he acquired the services of more men and
bought more and better carabao. In 1912 his production was
forty-two hundred bushels. In 1913 it reached fifty-three hundred
bushels, and his name became known in the Province.</p>

<p>Meantime it had happened that Diego&#39;s old father, back in
the barrio of his youth, remembered his own dreams of freedom, and
sent to tell his prosperous son that he, too, would like to hold
land, as they had planned it years ago.</p>

<p>&quot;You could lease from the Bureau of Lands a parcel of
public domain, good land, adjoining my homestead,&quot; Diego sent
word back.</p>

<p>So the old man did, and paid rent duly thereon for three or four
years. And with his gnarled old hands he cleared his land, Diego
helping, and mellowed it and planted it and put all his little
capital into it, gradually getting it into grateful shape. So that,
in the harvest of 1913, it was carrying its first handsome
yield.</p>

<p>And just then it was, when the heads showed golden and the time
was full, that, as in Blas Ramos&#39;s case, a party of rank
strangers appeared on the fields and deliberately started to reap
the crop.</p>

<p>The now-Filipinized Bureau of Lands, you see, having approved
the lease of Diego&#39;s father, and having for several years
accepted his payments on that account, had just seen fit to approve
a homestead claim to the very same ground. And the Bureau of
Lands&#39; friends believed in direct methods with taos.</p>

<p>But this time they had miscalculated their taos. Diego and his
father, warned on the moment of what was afoot, dashed out into the
fields to order the newcomers off. The invaders had raided in
force, however, and looked up from their sweeping sickles only to
threaten and jeer.</p>

<p>Diego ran back to his house for his gun. Returning on the
double-quick, he saw his father the centre of an ugly crowd, and
himself plunged in to the old man&#39;s aid. As he landed in the
midst of the mess, one of the strangers aimed a wicked slash at his
head. Diego threw up his gun to ward off the blow, which cut the
stock almost in two.</p>

<p>The raider chopped at him afresh. Diego fired, then fired again
at another of the gang who was in the act of bringing his bolo down
on the old man&#39;s neck.</p>

<p>Both shots killed. After that the nature of the proceedings
changed, and Diego went to jail.</p>

<p>In jail he stayed for six months, during which period the usual
two or three Americans moved Heaven and earth to prove him
justified in defending his life and his father&#39;s life and
property on his own ground.</p>

<p>In the end they freed him. But it cost the Americans no end of
work, it cost Diego very much money; and it cost the poor old man
his beloved land.</p>

<p>Because, as the authorities were understood to explain, &quot;a
homesteader is to be favoured rather than a lessee.&quot;</p>

<p>Those particular &quot;homesteaders,&quot; the richer and the
lazier by all the old man&#39;s work of years and by the investment
of all his little capital, triumphantly enjoy that land to this
day.</p>

<p>Diego is relatively young. Six months&#39; jail and the loss of
a lot of money are troubles that he could surmount. Diego is now
prosperous again and calm of mind. But the troubles that befell his
father struck hard&mdash;broke the old man&#39;s heart.</p>

<p>&quot;These things are happening all the time to taos like
us,&quot; said a neighbour tao, discussing the story. &quot;It may
be my turn to-morrow. What hope have we from our caciques? Diego is
lucky. That is the only difference. Diego had American
friends.&quot;</p>

<p>One reason why Diego has American friends lies in his definite
constructive value as a leader in any community in which he might
live. Back in the barrio in which he and his wife taught
school&mdash;the barrio where every one was always hungry, where no
one tilled the soil because their cacique robbed them of all their
labour&#39;s fruit&mdash;Diego&#39;s practical worth appeared. For,
when the people saw him, in the third year of his home-steading,
harvesting plentiful rice&mdash;his own rice on his own land, with
no cacique grabbing it out of his hands, they began to look askance
at their hunting&mdash;at their own lives of mas-terless dogs
catching fleas in the sun. And presently all of themselves they
began to ask for homesteading land near Diego.</p>

<p>Then, when they had got it, they naturally turned to Diego.</p>

<p>&quot;How do you so prosper?&quot; like children they asked
him.</p>

<p>&quot;I will tell you,&quot; he answered, &quot;I work eight or
ten hours a day. I don&#39;t gamble. I don&#39;t own a fighting
cock. I don&#39;t look for trouble. I make friends with good
people. And I work with everybody&#39;s interest in mind.&quot;</p>

<p>Soon his novel policy came to a measure of illustration in their
own lives, for, as far as their feebler brains and weaker wills
would permit, they followed Diego&#39;s trail. Upon any special
occasion, Diego could even produce their unified strength. At his
word that it was good, they would turn out, shack by shack, to
their full number, to cut brush or to switch the course of a stream
for the common service.</p>

<p>&quot;We must help this man,&quot; said the Americans, &quot;and
try to sustain his leadership. To back him and keep the wolves off
his trail is the best lift we can give these people.&quot;</p>

<p>So they backed him, making themselves known of the caciques as a
force that would individually rise like the other end of the
barrel-hoop if any one stepped on Diego Tecson. And Diego&#39;s
influence spread.</p>

<p>So matters stood when I knew Diego, in the spring of 1924. On
the day I left him he had just concluded a house-to-house
visitation to a neighbouring district where the taos were poor
&mdash;so poor as never to have what even they called enough to
eat. Poor as only dense ignorance and utter hopelessness could make
them, in a country such as the Philippines. Diego&#39;s errand had
been to invite them, one by one, to come to a town meeting to hear
about irrigation&mdash;to hear, also, the strange new doctrine of
uncoerced, unpaid community work for the community&#39;s good.</p>

<p>&quot;After the meeting I will take them all out and we will dig
a canal,&quot; said Diego to me, &quot;and then I will keep an eye
on them, and see that they don&#39;t get idle, but keep at the work
and work straight through to harvest.&quot;</p>

<p>And the grounds for believing that he, the unpaid volunteer, the
common village tao, will do all this, are, that he already has done
it, many times over.</p>

<p>As we sat together in his good, clean house, no longer
strangers, Diego spoke at ease.</p>

<p>&quot;This job of mine,&quot; he said, &quot;when you handle it
right, is the best in the world for any man, and the happiest. You
are independent. You get more when you work, and less when you
don&#39;t. And I think that is good.</p>

<p>&quot;As to education&mdash;a man is stronger, much stronger, to
help his community when he is educated. There are those who would
like to help, but who, being ignorant, can&#39;t.</p>

<p>&quot;These people know me and love me, and I like them. I
employ about a hundred of them on my land. I advise them how to
live. I show them how to take care of their babies&mdash;for of
that they know nothing<sup>2</sup>&mdash;how to get more eggs, how
to raise more chickens, how and why to plant fruit trees, how to
save. And I hammer at them to beat down their greatest
vice&mdash;the great vice of all this country&mdash;gambling. And
to show them the need of thrift.</p>

<p class="sup"><sup>2</sup> The death rate of babies under a year
old had been over fifty per cent. &quot;You might think that the
struggle for bare food would teach thrift to us, but it does not. I
have seen a man work and pinch for years till he got together two
thousand pesos [a thousand dollars]. Then he bought an automobile
for three thousand pesos, borrowing the difference from the company
of whom he made the purchase. He knew nothing at all about any
automobile. Yet, in his vanity, he must drive it. So, four days
from .the day he got it, he smashed his new property to ruin.</p>

<p>&quot;Now he has no car, no two thousand pesos, and is so deep
in debt over that other thousand that he borrowed that never again
in this world will he be a free man. And he, unfortunately, is no
exceptional case.&quot;</p>

<hr class="short">

<p>Now I, who write, beg careful attention from you who read for
the words about to come. I take a man&#39;s life in my hands as I
set them down, and nothing but their value can in any way justify
the risk. Diego Tecson is a figure among the dumb masses of his
physical kind. His intelligence and his public spirit rank him, tao
as he is, among the highest in the land. As for his courage in
putting into words his real thought on the most dangerous of
subjects, it is beyond praise.</p>

<p>To give him his due, will you please try to realize that free
speech does not exist in the Philippines? Any native who indulges
in it, expressing opinions contrary to the professed faith of the
leaders of the political majority, will be attacked. If he is
eminent, or if he is financially independent and valorous as well,
he may not suffer greatly. But if he is obscure, he will pay for
his boldness through injuries, bold or subtle, drawn out to the
point of ruin; or, not seldom, with his life.</p>

<p>A simple tao, therefore&mdash;a dark-skinned Malay peasant who
will speak as this man spoke&mdash;is a man indeed. As I watched
his face, grave, strong, ennobled with character and purpose, and
remembered his background, his record and the danger in which he
stood, I felt a tremendous thrill of enthusiasm. His words, with
all their heavy import, must reach America&mdash;the true America
whose very life-blood is freedom, justice and equal rights for all
mankind.</p>

<p>Here, then, is exactly what he said, deliberately, carefully, in
the easy English our schools have given him. I take it, phrase by
phrase, from the book that I carried that day.</p>

<p>&quot;This American Government is the best we ever had. I am
satisfied. I could live three hundred years under it. But our
pol&iacute;ticos&mdash;our caciques&mdash;they want Independence
from America in order to get more personal power for
themselves.</p>

<p>&quot;I remember very clearly the days of the Insurrection of
Aguinaldo. Aguinaldo&#39;s soldiers would come to you and say:</p>

<p>&quot;&#39;Give me a chicken.&#39;</p>

<p>&quot;If you refused, they said:</p>

<p>&quot;&#39;You belong to the other party.&#39;</p>

<p>&quot;And that night they burned your house, stole all your
goods and took you away and killed you. Not often did they kill you
simply or quickly either. They had ways of making the very idea of
death at their hands filthy and horrible. That very thing is what I
am afraid of now, if Independence befalls us. It will be repeated
at its worst, all over again. For our people are not changed at
heart in so short a time.</p>

<p>&quot;There are cacique families now&mdash;I can take you to
their <i>haciendas&mdash;</i>rich in carabao and
blankets&mdash;rich with goods all stolen from the taos under
pretence of wanting them for &#39;Aguinaldo&#39;s Army.&#39; They
were in that army&mdash;they were generals and colonels. But what
they took they shared with no one, but carried home and hid in
their own places to enrich themselves afterward. I know&mdash;we
all know&mdash;all about it.</p>

<p>&quot;&#39;Independence for the Philippines?&#39; Yes. I want
it, some day, but not now. Not till we, the taos, are strong. Now
we should all be the cacique&#39;s victims. If there is to be any
right and justice in that Independence, we taos must first be
educated, but, more even than that, we must learn to work.
Don&#39;t you see that it is not possible for the United States to
give us independence? It is for us to learn to deserve it and
support it. You cannot &#39;give&#39; us independence. No one can.
We taos, who are the big body of the Filipinos, we must make
ourselves strong, under your protection. We must first learn
industry, thrift, co-operation, team-work from barrio to barrio. We
must learn how to keep out of the usurer&#39;s hands, how to defend
ourselves against slavery, and to have courage to speak our minds
and how to stand on our feet. Then, when that is done, the United
States will do well to let us go. But if she does it before that
comes, she will be selling us out. She will be selling out the poor
man to the grafting tyrant.</p>

<p>&quot;What happens here now? You know what happened to
me&mdash;and I was luckier than most, because the Americans helped
me. Just take a time when canals are to be built in the rice-lands.
It is heavy work, and it must be done in advance of the season to
turn the water on. The dams, the laterals and all. When some one
opens new fields, the help of every pair of hands in the barrio is
needed, and the rich ask the help of the poor. The poor do as they
are asked&mdash;and are wrecked by it.</p>

<p>&quot;Right here, of late, a cacique got a barrio&#39;s help to
dig a trench. And now that, by the barrio&#39;s free labour, the
trench is done, the cacique is using it to cut the water off above
his poor neighbours&#39; fields and turn it back whence it came.
This he does in order to make the homesteaders&#39; crop fail, so
that they will get discouraged and give up the lands. It is his way
of profiting by their long hard work to break in the lands that are
their all.</p>

<p>&quot;Because, when they have dropped their good lands, he, the
cacique, will pick them up cheap and turn the water back.</p>

<p>&quot;We ought to have an American as director of the Bureau of
Lands as we used to do. Then we should have more land cultivated,
and we should have homesteaders more numerous, more interested, and
most confident in their work.</p>

<p>&quot;We did have an American Director of the Bureau of Lands
some years ago.</p>

<p>&quot;Then, before your land title was approved, it was properly
looked into by an American inspector who understood his work and
who really went to the place and made a real examination of the
land and gave real records. Him nobody could frighten or buy. We
should have all American inspectors of land. If we had, my poor old
father would not have been robbed of all he owned, and left
stripped and miserable in his last days.</p>

<p>&quot;When the Americans first came, we taos were told, by the
caciques, that Americans are all huge monsters who devour
everything and who chop off the heads of every Filipino they can
catch. But then, after a month or so, we saw that Americans hurt no
one, and paid for every bunch of bananas, every mango, every egg
they took. And from that time we knew that if America had not come
we should have lost all hope in the world.</p>

<p>&quot;When Aguinaldo&#39;s Insurrection ended we taos, wherever
his &#39;army&#39; had been, had no fowls, only small chicks. No
carabaos. No more salt. No crops&mdash;for no one had planted. What
was the use?</p>

<p>&quot;Now what we want is a peaceful condition&mdash;a chance to
work undisturbed and to save&mdash;to get ready for the future. I
said I want Independence. I do. We all do. But not for two or three
hundred years yet. Let us taos get ready, first. Do not hand us
over, helpless as we now are, and ignorant, to the mercy of our
robbers.</p>

<p>&quot;Our homesteaders here are very busy raising rice. Very
contented. They don&#39;t notice what the pol&iacute;ticos in
Manila do and say. They would not understand if they did. They
could only gauge what &#39;Independence&#39; would mean after the
change had come. And then they would use their bolos.</p>

<p>&quot;Only those leaders who are strong to-day and who are now
speaking in the United States, want Independence now. <i>All</i>
the weak, <i>all</i> the speechless, don&#39;t want it, because
they know all the power would remain in the hands of the
oppressors.</p>

<p>&quot;We shall not always be afraid before them, if you will
give us a chance, and your protection, to grow strong. But to-day
we could not hold our own. They would take away all that we have
gained under America. Quezon, Aguinaldo and those others&mdash;they
would be the head of the Islands. And all their train would have a
free hand against us.</p>

<p>&quot;As to these rice-growers&mdash;these homesteaders&mdash;if
you ask them if they want &#39;Independence/ they will say yes.
Because they have been told by political speech-makers that
&#39;Independence&#39; means paying no more taxes and doing no more
work &mdash;a sort of magic to make everybody rich and idle. But
they have no idea at all, beyond that, what the word signifies.</p>

<p>&quot;Ask them if they want America to go away. Ask them how
many years they want America to keep on governing them, and you
will get the truth&mdash;if no politico is listening.</p>

<p>&quot;Or, if they understand a little, they are afraid to speak
straight out, because they know that if they are reported to be
speaking against Independence, their houses will be burned, their
crops.fired, their animals killed and more. Because that is just
what is done.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Independence! Why, we <i>have</i> Independence
<i>now!&quot;</i></p>

<a name="ch-07" id="ch-07"></a>
<h2>Chapter VII &mdash; MIDNIGHT TO MORNING</h2>

<p>And now, perhaps, the time is ripe for a little historic survey
of the ground.</p>

<p>Where did all these people come from&mdash;these present-day
&quot;Christian Filipinos&quot; with whom the earlier chapters have
been concerned?</p>

<p>From Indo-China, from Borneo, from the west and the south,
beginning two thousand years or more ago, came the ancestors of the
tao millions of to-day. Wave by wave they came, sailing in their
cockleshell boats, through succeeding centuries. And the first of
the lot found already on the soil a set of curious little black
fellows&mdash;pygmies with woolly heads, great shots with poisoned
arrows, a race both timid and fierce.</p>

<p>But, before the newcomers, the pygmies fled to remote mountain
forests where, known as &quot;negritos,&quot; their descendants
still survive unchanged. And the ancestors of the taos slipped into
the pygmies&#39; nests, squatting on their rich lowlands&mdash;the
hot, rich, jungle lowlands, where men scarcely need to work.</p>

<p>Just as they had come in their cockleshell boats, strangers and
foreigners to each other, without intercognizance or plan, so,
party by party, they camped upon the land, starting their separate
and unrelated settlements. And, as centuries still swung on, so
they remained. Each settlement, as it gradually multiplied to many
settlements, to a tribe, still retained its apartness&mdash;its
tribal language and name and habits, its peculiar superstitions and
ideas. And each looked at each other askance. No co-operation
existed among them&mdash;no sort of understanding or union. Nor had
any tribal unit a tribal government. But each cluster of
families&mdash;each village, obeyed its own strongest
member.<sup>1</sup></p>

<p>Such was the grade of these people in the biological development
of man.</p>

<p>Such, too, did it remain, while changing powers claimed
ownership of the islands. The Indo-Chinese, the Bornese, the
Javanese, the Chinese Empires in turn took sovereigns&#39; tribute
without affecting, the while, the actual condition of the primitive
and stagnant population. Never was it free from foreign dominion,
yet never did that dominion touch its life.</p>

<p>Then of a sudden, when the fifteenth century was already halfway
spent, a new planet rose. Islam, appearing in the south, flamed
north and still northward until, by the end of the next hundred
years, it had advanced as far as the present Manila, with every
prospect of casting the permanent form of the life of the whole
archipelago.</p>

<p>And this event was only forestalled by the coming of militant
missionary Spain.</p>

<p>Spain, herself swooping down out of the blue, established one
garrison settlement at Cebu, one on the smoking ruins of the
Mohammedan town where Manila now stands, and thence worked south,
planting her flag along the shores.</p>

<p>But, try as she would, she could never subdue or greatly affect
the originally Mohammedanized islands to the far southwest, neither
the free high-mountain peoples&mdash;the Igorots of inmost
Luzon.</p>

<p>The rest of the country, however, she gradually assumed, whether
nominally or in fact, dividing it into provinces, establishing a
sort of colonial government, organizing trading machinery, and
always, under every difficulty, pushing her main purpose&mdash;to
Christianize the people to the greater Glory of God.</p>

<p>This was the task of the priests, supported at a distance by a
mere handful of Spanish soldiers. The ships of Legazpi, the
conqueror, brought five Augustinian friars, with but four hundred
fighting men.</p>

<p class="sup"><sup>1</sup> Legazpi&#39;s <i>Relation,</i> July 7,
1569. Blair &amp; Robertson, Vol. Ill, pp. 1-2.</p>

<p>Legazpi&#39;s priests and their successors plunged into the
stark unknown, made ghastly journeys, lived and died in hardship
and privation of body and soul, in labours and dangers untold, that
they might bring the heathen &quot;under the bells.&quot; You find
their big stone churches to-day, overgrown with jungle, crumbling
to ruin, back in far wildernesses where, with incredible toil, they
raised them two hundred years ago. You look at the rudimentary
humanity about&mdash;so truly rudimentary, still, after centuries
of continuance!&mdash;and you marvel at the faith and courage of
those first gentlemen of the Church.</p>

<p>They began the long, slow lift from barbarism. And because of
their heroic work and of the faithful support of Spain, the present
Filipino majority stand alone as the only large mass of Asiatics
converted to a profession of Christianity in modern times. The
Filipino owes to the Roman Catholic Church, which taught them the
outward forms of Christianity, and to Spain, which gave them a
bystander&#39;s view of the forms of European law, points not often
realized or confessed.</p>

<p>In the three hundred years of Spanish rule evils, however, grew
up alongside the good. Weak spots, foolish spots, bad
spots&mdash;and big ones, at that&mdash;developed in the
r&eacute;gime. A &quot;mestizo&quot; class
arose&mdash;half-breeds&mdash;and, as village overlords (caciques),
cringing to the Spaniards above, merciless to the Malay below,
enriched themselves by sucking the life of the people at its
roots.</p>

<p>The Church did every one&#39;s thinking and preferred fixed
boundaries. But the few young men that went abroad&mdash;mestizos
all, or almost all&mdash;came back with new ideas. And when the
opening of Suez Canal occurred, bringing suddenly more ships, more
strangers, more glimpses of the world, the stir of the times had
already filtered through, causing unrest.</p>

<p>From various roots and motives secret societies sprang up.
Plots. Conspiracies. Well-grounded demands for reform. In 1896 a
definite insurrection arose against the Spanish Government.</p>

IGOROT MOUNTAIN TRAILS<br>
M. M. Newell</p>

<p>This insurrection, led by the mestizo Aguinaldo, lasted but
sixteen months and was compounded between its leaders and the
Spanish government for cash.</p>

<p>Meantime, life for the island masses flowed on. Between the free
mountaineers of the north and the free Mohammedans of the south,
forever cowered the &quot;Christian Filipino&quot;&mdash;the poor
old tao in his millions, sweating blood in the
darkness&mdash;afraid of all men, all devils and all
gods&mdash;while the Spanish ruler and the little cacique
bloodsucker beneath the Spaniard pinned him firmly down.</p>

<p>Not a shining picture. And if you want details of its darkest,
most hopeless part&mdash;the tao&#39;s part&mdash;you will find a
good deal of it in <i>The Social Cancer&mdash;</i>a book written by
a Filipino called Jos&eacute; Rizal&mdash;one who, a little before
Aguinaldo, conspired against Spain, but who, unlike Aguinaldo,
neglected to cash in.</p>

<p>So that, in the end, he faced a Spanish firing squad outside the
walls of old Manila, and died.</p>

<p>Not a shining picture, any of it. And all its ugliness, its
savagery and barbarity, was of so long, so logical a standing, in
so unconsidered, so unknown a world&#39;s backwater, that you might
have wagered it would go on at its own pace, undisturbed,
developing by evolution only, to the end of time.</p>

<p>And then one bright morning in February, 1898, far away in
Havana harbour, on the other side of the globe, came one single
flash of fire, one single crash of sound, and the battleship
<i>Maine,</i> officers and men on board, sank to the bottom of the
sea.</p>

<p>The United States declared war on Spain. Commodore Dewey,
commanding our Asiatic Squadron, slid over from British Hongkong,
less than thirty-six hours away, and grabbed the Spanish fleet in
Manila Bay.</p>

<p>And the Philippine Islands were United States territory.</p>

<p>Spain signed the Treaty of Paris, surrendering the Philippine
Islands as conquest of war. Later again, the United States of
America paid to Spain, which retained the indebtedness of the
Philippine Islands, the cash sum of $20,000,000 gold. And finally
Aguinaldo and his friends, who had re-appeared from abroad to
pursue a somewhat dubious and troublesome &quot;co-operation&quot;
with our forces, openly turned their activities against us, thereby
necessitating a campaign on our part to restore peace to the
Islands.</p>

<p>This period is yet remembered by the tao, everywhere, as Diego
Tecson remembers it, in forward-peering dread. For the &quot;Army
of Aguinaldo&quot; lived on the land. No poor man&#39;s life or
property was his own. And, as with foreboding the poor man now
reflects, many of those who invented and perpetrated upon their
fellow-Filipinos the merciless lootings and obscene brutalities of
those awful days are yet in their early fifties. Acclaimed in
Manila as &quot;patriot veterans&quot; they are politically active
to-day, earnest advocates of the Independence that would give them
again a free hand.</p>

<p>Aguinaldo&#39;s &quot;government&quot; was never a republic even
in a potential sense. It was the grief and despair of its better
minds, a reign of terror and rapine, imposed by a handful of
barbarians upon the cowering mass of their own people.</p>

<p>In March, 1901, Aguinaldo surrendered to our arms. And so, by a
third means and for a third time, we established our material
possession of the Philippines, establishing thereby our full
responsibility, before the world and our own conscience, to the
whole people of the Philippine Islands.</p>

<p>From the start, we took that responsibility seriously. Congress
passed an act making exploitation of the natural resources of the
Philippine Islands impossible, safeguarding them for the Island
people&mdash;a remarkably magnanimous and constructive piece of
legislation. In the Islands themselves our military Governors and
provincial administrators admirably acquitted themselves of their
several charges. Meantime a competent civil commission, headed by
Judge William Howard Taft, laboured to frame a set of laws under
which we might hope by faith and patience, by justice and hard
work, to raise wild men and primitive peons to the level of a sound
and enlightened people.</p>

<p>On July 4, 1901, our Military Government terminated. Most of our
troops were withdrawn. And Mr. Taft, as Civil Governor, assumed the
administration of the Islands.</p>

<p>His cabinet, appointed by the President of the United States,
consisted of four American Commissioners&mdash;Mr. Luke E. Wright,
of Tennessee, serving as Secretary of Commerce and Police; Mr.
Henry C. Ide, of Vermont, as Secretary of Finance and Justice; Mr.
Bernard Moses, of California, as Secretary of Public Instruction;
and Mr. Dean C. Worcester, of Michigan, as Secretary of the
Interior. The commission was further strengthened by the membership
of Dr. Trinidad H. Pardo de Tavera, and of Se&ntilde;ores Benito
Legarda and Jos&eacute; R. de Lu-zuriaga, Filipinos, good men all
three.</p>

<p>This Commission form of Government, unchanged except for
personnel, obtained until October 16, 1907. Then, as a step in the
political education of the people, it became the Upper House of
&quot;the Philippine Legislature,&quot; supported by a new
invention&mdash;an elective Filipino Assembly&mdash;as Lower
Chamber.</p>

<p>Meantime, and from the very day of conquest, America in the
Philippines had been violently affected by the atmosphere into
which she had walked. Physical and social conditions, as fast as
the army unveiled them, outraged every tenet of Yankee decency.
Ablaze with pity and with righteous wrath, our people flew at the
Islands like a White-Wing brigade in a sort of Holy War upon
ignorance, superstition, disease and dirt.</p>

<p>In the town of Manila alone Father McKinnon, padre of the First
Californias, opened seven schools before we had been twenty-one
days in the place, calling soldiers from the ranks to teach. And
a-b-c and chloride of lime marched with the marching flag.</p>

<p>The very words &quot;sanitation,&quot; &quot;quarantine,&quot;
&quot;health laws,&quot; &quot;medical care,&quot; had neither
meaning nor equivalent in the islands&mdash;a condition that our
people would not endure.</p>

<p>To tell in its proper order all that happened would spin too
long a tale. The commands of our doctors, sanitary engineers and
sanitary inspectors were driven home by the firm military hand. The
people fought back with all the fierce, abiding fury of ignorance
and superstitious fear&mdash;and fought in vain.</p>

<p>Then we repaired and built highways and bridges. We made of
Manila&#39;s impossible typhoon-swept frontage one of the safest
and best harbours in the East. We elaborately surveyed and charted
the island waters, and we enlarged and completed the Spanish
light-house system. We framed and enacted a scheme of provincial
and municipal government. We amended the criminal law, enacted
forestry laws and a general school law, established a school
system, trade schools, agricultural schools, a university. And we
imported American school-teachers, male and female&mdash;at one
time a thousand in a single ark&mdash;scattering them broadcast
under orders to instruct young Malays out of exactly the same text
books that young John Alden was using at home!</p>

<p>We reformed the currency, giving the Islands, in place of the
international hodgepodge that had helped to keep them poor, a
stabilized currency of their own. We reversed the system of import
duties that we found&mdash;whereby cigars and champagne went
light-burdened while flour and oil paid high. We took a census. Mr.
Taft himself went to Rome and negotiated for the people of the
Philippines, for the sum of $7,000,000, clear title to the
friars&#39; land.</p>

<p>We made of Manila, that ancient pest-hole, a pleasant, almost a
clean city. Good public buildings, modern hospitals, prisons,
schoolhouses and sanitary markets sprang up. Not only in Manila but
in the provinces, ports and harbours were improved. The courts of
law were somewhat cleansed of some of their sins. A postal savings
bank, started in 1907, grew apace. Land-surveys were pushed.
Highroads were built, far and wide and well, incalculably advancing
the possibilities of the country.</p>

<p>And, contrary to America&#39;s general belief, we did all this
and much more also, not at America&#39;s financial expense, but
wholly out of the revenues of the Islands, accomplishing by an
administration cleaner and more efficient than we have ever enjoyed
at home a miracle of achievement and economy.</p>

<p>True to our own conception of a stewardship, we made, from the
first, a steady effort to introduce the Filipino into Government
service, using him under guidance and advancing him toward
responsibility as his ability increased. And by October, 1913, the
process had so far progressed that the Government payrolls showed
seventy-two Filipino office-holders to every twenty-eight
Americans.</p>

<p>These new office-holders were necessarily of the cacique mestizo
class, for the reason that the great mass of the people had not yet
time to produce under our school system&mdash;the first ever put
within their reach&mdash;a competent representation.</p>

<p>It would be idle to pretend that this policy of working native
personnel into the Government machine conduced to the quickest
material results. To have supported our American chiefs of
departments with complete staffs of American experts would have
been at least to double their accomplishment. But our primary
object was, not to raise to ourselves a monument of material
achievement, but to train the people in practice, so that one day,
when that training should have struck deep&mdash;should have become
no longer an artificial attitude but bone of their bone, spirit of
their spirit&mdash;they could take the reins and drive alone.</p>

<p>That some of them should desire to anticipate that day was human
and natural. Aguinaldo&#39;s insurrectionists had raised the demand
for Independence, and Aguinaldo&#39;s insurrectionists were still
young men. Independence, furthermore, is a talismanic word in
mortal ears. But many of the soberer minds felt that a tremendous
opportunity was now offered them to build, under skilled and
generous guidance and powerful protection, foundations more solid
than any they had dreamed for their structure of ultimate free
nationhood.</p>

<p>And we, of America, sent them as in honour bound our best
men&mdash;Mr. Taft, Mr. Cameron Forbes, Mr. Dean C. Worcester,
among the administrators; General Wood and Pershing and Alien and
Harbord, as military chiefs; Dr. Victor G. Heiser and Dr. Paul
Freer, as scientists; Archbishop Harty and Bishop Brent as clergy,
only to touch upon the list. And their combined effort worked with
power.</p>

<p>Meantime, down among the unknown ranks, the best types of
disinterested, well-trained, hard-working Americans spent all their
imagination, wisdom, courage and strength in teamwork beyond all
praise.</p>

<p>Many of them lost their lives in their devotion to the cause
they had espoused. Few of them have been either acknowledged or
remembered. None, I think, grudged the life he gave.</p>

<h2>Chapter VIII &mdash; WOODROW WILSON&#39;S WARNING</h2>

<blockquote>Self-government is not a mere form of institutions...It
is a form of character...We can give the Filipinos constitutional
government, a government which they may count upon to be
just,...but we must ourselves for the present supply that
government...Self-government is not a thing that can be
&quot;given&quot; to any people...No people can be
&quot;given&quot; the self-control of maturity.<sup>1</sup> Only a
long apprenticeship of obedience can secure them the precious
possession...We of all people in the world should know these
fundamental things...To ignore them would be not only to fail and
fail miserably, but to fail ridiculously and belie ourselves.<br>
<br>
WOODROW WILSON.<sup>2</sup></blockquote>

<p>&quot;To fail ridiculously and belie ourselves.&quot;</p>

<p>So wrote the President of Princeton, cloistered and apart, calm
scholar of the science of government and of the history of the
world.</p>

<p>And he added his expression of our own profound debt to the fact
that the men who colonized America and made its government &quot;to
the admiration of the world&quot; came of a stock that, under the
Crown, had &quot;served the long apprenticeship of political
childhood during which law was law without choice of their
own.&quot;</p>

<p>Five years later, however, now head of a great political party
and President of the United States, Woodrow Wilson sent his message
<sup>3</sup> straight to the people of the Philippines. That
message conveyed the news that he was giving at once to the native
citizens of the Islands a majority in the Appointive Commission. In
other words, that he was already placing in their hands the control
of their legislative body.</p>

<p class="sup"><sup>3</sup> <i>The Corner-Stone of Philippine
Independence.</i> Francis Burton Harrison, New York, 1922, p.
50.</p>

<p>The dictum was carried by the newly appointed Governor-General,
Francis Burton Harrison, who himself frankly accounts it the
victor&#39;s prize in &quot;a fight for absolute control of the
purse-strings of the Government.&quot; <sup>4</sup> This is the
more interesting since Mr. Harrison states<sup>5</sup> that he owed
his own selection for appointment to the direct request of a
Filipino leader in that same fight for the purse-strings both in
Manila and in Washington.</p>

<p class="sup"><sup>4</sup> <i>The Corner-Stone of Philippine
Independence,</i> p. 51.</p>

<p class="sup"><sup>5</sup> <i>Ibid.,</i> p. 1.</p>

<p>To go into the personal record of Mr. Harrison during his
governor-generalship would be a disheartening thing. He took office
on October 6, 1913, and lasted for nearly eight years.</p>

<p>The history of those eight years is the one thing that, before
our Filipino accusers, stops an American tongue with shame.</p>

<p>&quot;We could have removed Governor Harrison at any time,&quot;
said an authoritative Filipino witness. &quot;In fact Washington
desired to remove him, but we asked to have him retained. He suited
our purpose.&quot;</p>

<p>Said another: &quot;If by his private life and his public
conduct he mocked the dignity of the highest office&mdash;why
should we care? It was your honour in question, not ours.&quot;</p>

<p>Said a third: &quot;Some of my political associates think that
Mr. Harrison&#39;s political procedure advanced our status. As for
me, I know that it set us far back, and most unfairly. You had
started us on a course of constructive training. You were educating
our children. You were working our boys up, so you said, in order
that, with time and experience, we might develop material and
ability to govern ourselves. You told us that the only man fit for
any office was the man best able to do its work. That was hard
doctrine for us to credit, we who for centuries have been
Spanish-trained. But for fourteen years you drilled it into us and
practised what you preached. So that we were just beginning to take
our tongues out of our cheeks and to believe you meant what you
said.</p>

THE HOMES OF THE MILLIONS<br>
M. M. Newell</p>

<p>&quot;And then, all in a flash, you snatch your whole scheme up
by the roots, toss it overboard, elevate a base example to highest
office and dash the Government into our hands! You had no right to
do it! You had only begun your work when you cast it aside like a
thoughtless child tired of a toy.</p>

<p>&quot;You had no right to play with a people&#39;s fate that
way.</p>

<p>&quot;And when we made a mess of things, as we surely did, and
were bound to do, what do you do? Do you say as a just people
would: &#39;It is all our fault. These people are victims of our
own folly?&#39; Not you! You say: &#39;Look at the hopeless
creatures! They are no more capable of self-government than the
cattle in the fields.&#39; &quot;</p>

<p>All these statements quoted above are set down from the
speakers&#39; lips. And it is well to bear always in mind that no
such confidence, no such open speech, could be elicited from any
mature and responsible man&mdash;any man with property or place or
peace to lose&mdash;except in circumstances of strictest privacy
and under pledge to safeguard the speaker&#39;s identity in every
way. Under such conditions the non-political Filipino is glad to
speak, in earnest hope that his words may reach the people of
America and by them be heeded. But he will not&mdash;for his life
he dare not&mdash;give his messenger the right to use his name.</p>

<p>The new policy of indiscriminate Filipinization showed its
results more immediately in some directions than in others, but its
general effect was a slump all along the line. The upward course
had been swift&mdash;because it was, in fact, wholly the work, not
of Orientals, but of high-class Western specialists operating as it
were by chance on Oriental stuff.</p>

<p>Now, with that foreign pressure weakened or withdrawn, the
ancient inherent forces of inertia, of sloth, of indifference, of
ignorance, of cruelty, of greed of place and power, made felt their
weight, and sped the fall.</p>

<p>The lean cacique pack, so long kept starving at the door, had
got inside at last.</p>

<p>And the American Governor-General sat back and smiled.</p>

<p>Then, in August, 1916, came the passage of the Jones
Law<sup>6</sup> by the United States Congress.</p>

<p class="sup"><sup>6</sup> See Appendix 1.</p>

<p>In the nearly three years that had passed since the inauguration
of the new policy the administration would appear to have recurred
with some misgiving to its leader&#39;s prophetic words. Perhaps
indeed, &quot;To ignore them would be not only to fail and fail
miserably but to fail ridiculously and belie ourselves.&quot;</p>

<p>In any case, the Jones Law, new Organic Law of the Islands, went
forward to Governor-General Harrison under a remarkable covering
letter from the Secretary of War, Mr. Newton D. Baker.</p>

<p>In it Mr. Baker points out the good will of Congress toward the
Islands, but shows that, because of that very good will, Congress
has questioned its own wisdom in passing the Act, gravely doubting
lest it has thereby given more in the way of self-government than
the Filipino people can yet handle to their own good.</p>

<p>The Secretary, therefore, believes that both the President of
the United States and the Governor-General are bound to admit no
infringement upon the power in their hands. In other words, both
must exert the utmost care to permit no further assumptions by the
Filipinos of powers that it was the purpose of Congress to
withhold. To neglect this duty, would be to assume an unwise
responsibility and to lay Mr. Wilson&#39;s administration open to
charge of failure due to a lack of appreciation of the mind of
Congress as expressed in the Jones Bill.</p>

<p>Serious mistakes, the Secretary asserts, have already been made
in the Philippines, especially as to the Philippine As-sembly. This
body, while yet only a prospect, was eagerly awaited by the Island
people as a panacea for political discontent. The actual workings
of the Assembly, however, have been branded a failure. But the
direct responsibility for the failure lies at the door of those
whose duty it was to restrict the Philippine Assembly to things by
law its province, yet who, by their too great leniency, let it run
out of bounds.</p>

<p>Mr. Taft, for example, in inaugurating the Assembly, stated that
the Speaker of that body was the second person in the Islands.
This, says Mr. Baker, was wholly outside the law and the purpose of
the law. More, it was contrary to world precedent. And yet, because
of Mr. Taft&#39;s mistake, a situation has been created from which
no means of withdrawal has since been found. In the same way more
serious breaches have been broken through the law&#39;s purport.
Executive powers properly pertaining only to the Governor-General
have been assumed by the Speaker of the Assembly, and by him passed
on to newly invented inter-session committees with newly-invented
personnel, establishments&mdash;and payrolls. All these encroach
upon the Sovereign power of the United States. But, the original
mistake of permitting their existence having been committed, no
means of retrieval have yet appeared.</p>

<p>Mr. Baker also points out, and with great and repeated emphasis,
the error of former administrations in permitting purely executive
powers to be exercised by the Speaker of the Assembly and by
Legislative committees. The appropriation bills passed under
earlier administrations bear witness to the mistake. The present
Administration, he is particularly glad to affirm, will be saved
from all such pitfalls by that provision of the new law which
directly forbids the exercise of executive functions by other than
executive officers, and whose purpose is to put an end to the
creeping infringements of the past.</p>

<p>The passage of the Jones Law to which Secretary Baker here
refers is contained in Section 22, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>Provided, that all executive functions of the
Government must be directly under the Governor-General or within
one of the executive departments under the supervision and control
of the Governor-General.</blockquote>

<p>The Secretary of War farther comments on the continuous
difficulty heretofore encountered by the Governors-General in their
efforts to secure passage for good legislation. It has heretofore
been necessary, Mr. Baker states, practically to bribe the Assembly
to pass any desirable bill. This has resulted in the creation of
multiplied paid committees of the Assembly, in the payment of
exorbitant per diems and salaries and in the appointment of many
unneeded employ&eacute;s of the Assembly.</p>

<p>The unfortunate fact that former Governors-General have yielded
the proper power of the United States to encroachment by native
legislators will make the course expected of the present Executive
the more arduous. But the purpose of the new Organic Act is
unmistakable and cannot be escaped. Therefore, in spite of all
difficulty, a new spirit must now be instilled into the
Legislature. The Legislature must be made to see and to accept the
limitation of its powers. Otherwise, says Mr. Baker, the experiment
involved in the passage of the Jones Law must be a hopeless
failure.</p>

<p>Filipinization, Mr. Baker points out, has been proceeding very
rapidly under Mr. Harrison. Hereafter, Mr. Harrison will take care
that no American in higher office be replaced by a Filipino except
where the public welfare is thereby served. As to the lower grades,
there should be progress but, particularly in the more responsible
branches&mdash;as the Constabulary, the auditors, treasurers,
teachers, etc.&mdash;that progress must be slow.</p>

<p>The intent of the new law, says Secretary Baker, is to make the
power of the Governor-General far greater than it has been in the
past. For this it has provided by several definite means,
conspicuous among which is the &quot;comprehensive veto
power.&quot;</p>

<p>The Governor-General of the Philippines, so Mr. Baker lays down,
must, in any time of disagreement with the Legislature, take an
inflexible stand against any act involving a departure from our
policy for the Islands. He must see to it, for instance, and see to
it watchfully, that no discrimination against American citizens,
for whatever cause or provocation, be allowed.</p>

<p>Congress omitted, it is true, to embody in the act a specific
clause to this effect. And this omission was permitted, says Mr.
Baker, on the special plea of certain persons who affirmed that the
insertion of such a clause would hurt the sensibilities of the
Philippine Legislature,&mdash;which they declared, for a multitude
of reasons based on gratitude for what has been done, would never
seriously contemplate the passage of laws discriminating against
American citizens.</p>

<p>Mr. Baker, however, remarks that he does not consider that this
argument would stand much strain in practice.</p>

<p>He emphatically states that the most absolute loyalty to the
United States of America, free from a breath of doubt, must be
demanded of all office-holders in the Islands and that not the
slightest easing down of any outward form and observance of loyalty
shall be anywhere permitted. And he quotes from Section 6,
continuing in force existing law, the following:</p>

<blockquote>An indispensable qualification for all offices and
positions of trust and authority in the Islands must be absolute
and unconditional loyalty to the United States, and absolute and
unhampered authority and power to remove and punish any officer
deviating from that standard must at all times be retained in the
hands of the central authority of the Islands.</blockquote>

<p>Mr. Baker then speaks, and with the gravest force, of the duty
of the American Governor-General to safeguard to the utmost the
Insular Auditor&#39;s office. <i>The Insular Auditor&#39;s office
must not and shall not be weakened,</i> either by withholding
appropriations for its proper staff, or by attacks upon the civil
service. If any such attempt is made, says the Democratic Secretary
of War, it will be the duty of the Governor-General to see to it
that the Philippine Legislature clearly understands that the act
will be regarded in the United States as a betrayal of
confidence.</p>

<p>Finally, any betrayal of the confidence implied in the new law
so doubtfully enacted by the American Congress can only result in
the withdrawal by Congress of the powers therein granted, and in
the justification of the many who believe that the Jones Law itself
is unwarranted, premature and unwise.</p>

<p>This document, which obviously came from an anxious mind, was as
obviously intended as an index of the dangers of the new law.</p>

<p>&quot;Here,&quot; it might have said, &quot;is a map of the
expansion cracks that we have doubtfully left to take up future
growth in the Islands. Be warned of your own grave duty, as
American Executive, to see to it that no unwise or premature or
unscrupulous use is made of those cracks, and be prompt to
forestall vicious strategy.&quot;</p>

<p>Secretary Baker&#39;s letter was intended for the private
guidance of its recipient. Mr. Harrison, however&mdash;so it is
affirmed&mdash;without delay and without reserve spread that letter
wide open before some of the chief Filipino pol&iacute;ticos. Its
contents were soon bandied about in political Manila. And, with the
great advantage of that carefully-thought-out document as a guide,
neatly reversing its &quot;dos&quot; and its &quot;don&#39;ts&quot;
the pol&iacute;ticos proceeded to open the barrel according to the
directions on the head.</p>

<p>The history of the next five years is a history of destruction,
decay and loot.</p>

<p>A steady output of legislation began&mdash;legislation to eat
away the powers of the Governor-General&mdash;to undermine the
authority of the United States, to create ever new jobs, new
salaries and new appropriations and to do away with the old
safeguards. Mr. Baker&#39;s official directions in hand, the
pol&iacute;ticos carefully did to the Jones Law&mdash;the Organic
Act, as it was called&mdash;each and every thing that the
directions forbade. And then they went on to inventions of their
own.</p>

<p>These things, in themselves, were all or almost all unlawful.
But the Organic Act ordains (sec. 19) that the President of the
United States shall approve or disapprove an act submitted to
him...within six months from and after its enactment and submission
for his approval; and if not approved within such time it shall
become a law the same as if it had been specifically approved.</p>

<p>But the World War was on, filling all minds. None of the
legislation just described elicited Washington&#39;s notice. And
Governor-General Harrison, in the whole course of his
administration, used his veto power but five times&mdash;and then
in minor cases.</p>

<p>Thus, without let or hindrance, every department but the Supreme
Court was cast into the hands of the cacique politico, lock, stock
and barrel. And in every one, the work so carefully, soundly,
economically built up during our first fourteen years, went
glimmering.</p>

<p>The court dockets, at the beginning of Mr. Harrison&#39;s
r&eacute;gime, were practically clear. At the end more than 50,000
cases clogged the lists, hopelessly awaiting trial.</p>

<p>Medical, health and sanitation work fell off to a catastrophic
degree. The death rate showed this:</p>

<p>1913 ... 19.10 per thousand<br>
1918 ... 40.79 per thousand</p>

<p>Nor is the terrible discrepancy to be accounted for by the fact
that 1918 was the year of the influenza.</p>

<p>Rinderpest and anthrax, two deadly epidemics, raged among the
cattle, killing off hundreds of thousands annually and ruining
thousands of farmers whose livelihood lay with their draft-stock;
and the quarantines that should have saved them were never
enforced&mdash;for the experienced American veterinarians and
cattle-inspectors had all been dropped out of the service, leaving
ignorant and venal local caciques to dictate at pleasure. Pests
threatened the rice and hemp, vital crops both, and the Filipinized
Bureau of Agriculture slept on. The Legislature slashed the
appropriation for the Bureau of Science&mdash;maker of vaccines,
serums, analyses, etc.&mdash;the bureau that perhaps contributed
more to the Islands&#39; prosperity than any other one
instrument.</p>

<p>The University, even when American-controlled, had of necessity
maintained a standard lower than those of America because of the
condition of the country. It had aimed, however, by gradual
development of the whole educational system to raise that standard.
With Filipinization hope died, and requirements dropped far and
hard.</p>

<p>Meantime, while quality everywhere went tumbling, expenses
soared. During the administration of Governor-General Cameron
Forbes, who preceded Mr. Harrison in office, the budget of the
Government did not exceed $14,000,000. Out of that sum,
Governor-General Forbes not only kept up every department in
administration and performance, but built fine highways into
practically every part of the Islands, thereby releasing and
increasing the country&#39;s wealth. His tightly wound machine
continued to run on for a time by original impetus. But while new
mileage was built, much of that already constructed now rapidly
decayed, leaving sad wreckage to masquerade on paper records as
&quot;first-class highways.&quot;</p>

<p>During Mr. Harrison&#39;s administration the budget shot up from
$14,000,000 to $50,000,000, the country went almost bankrupt, and
at the close of the period it was necessary to create an additional
bonded indebtedness of $48,000,000.</p>

<p>A great increase appeared in the country&#39;s revenue. This,
however, was due not to increased production but to war inflation
of the values of sugar and cocoanut oil. The country&#39;s almost
bankruptcy came, first, from general maladministration, which
included a flood of loose expenditure that rose far above the mark
set by war prices; and second, from mad . governmental ventures
into banking, railway management and general &quot;business,&quot;
so-called.</p>

<p>With eyes wide open, with our President&#39;s warning in our
ears, we rushed down the well-marked road to &quot;Fail and Fail
Miserably...to Fail Ridiculously and Belie Ourselves.&quot;</p>

<h2>Chapter IX &mdash; &quot;I MEANT WHAT I SAID&quot;</h2>

<p>On March 5, 1921, the day after the inauguration of President
Harding, Mr. Harrison quitted his Governor-Generalship and the
Islands.</p>

<p>Up to to-day, America has sent seven Governors to the Philippine
Islands&mdash;four Republicans and three Democrats&mdash;of which
latter, by the way, the first two were appointed by President
Roosevelt. Of these seven, Francis Burton Harrison is the sole and
only one not accused, condemned and reviled for his works, during
his time in office, by the Filipino politico.</p>

<p>Meantime, from half the world away, the smell of the thing had
reached America, and the incoming administration could not but see
that something must quickly be done to redeem our name in the
Orient. The journey from Washington to Manila uses up one month. On
May 4th, 1921&mdash;just sixty days after Mr. Harding took
office&mdash;his Special Mission to the Philippines entered Manila
harbour.</p>

<p>It consisted of two men logically equipped to form and to render
an intelligent opinion on the subject in hand.</p>

<p>One, Major-General Leonard Wood, had twice served in the
Islands, first as Governor of the Moro Province (1903-1906), again
as commanding the Philippine Division of the U. S. Army (1906-8)
and was therefore personally familiar with place and people;
besides which he had behind him, in his two and one-half years&#39;
service as Governor-General of Cuba, a record of accomplishment in
the only in-any-way-similar problem that had ever confronted
America.</p>

<p>The other Commissioner, Mr. W. Cameron Forbes, had been a member
of the old Philippines Commission as secretary of Commerce and
Police from 1904<i>.</i> to 1908; had served as Vice-Governor of
the Philippines from 1908 to 1909; and had served as
Governor-General from 1909 to 1913. As financial and engineering
expert, Mr. Forbes&#39;s rating in America is high. His
administration in the Philippines had been eminently distinguished
by accomplishment, economy and generous devotion. Further, as that
administration lay but eight years back, itself constituting Mr.
Harrison&#39;s point of departure, the whole nature and history of
recent events needed no interpreter to Mr. Forbes&#39;s eye.</p>

<p>Both men commanded the Spanish language.</p>

<p>The Mission set promptly to work. And the very first thing that
it found, staring it in the face like a ghost on the threshold, was
this fact:&mdash;The affairs of the Philippine Islands were in a
condition of absolute chaos. Only money could retrieve them from
ruin. And the Philippine Islands of themselves could by no means
and by no possibility raise money. For their credit was killed.</p>

<p>Therefore Major-General Wood and Mr. W. Cameron Forbes, as their
first basic act, sent to the Congress of the United States an
appeal for immediate rescue for the Philippine Islands.</p>

<p>And the Congress of the United States was so impressed by the
urgency of that appeal that it stopped other affairs in the midst
of a busy session to pass an act increasing the authority of the
Philippine Islands to borrow money.</p>

<p>This life-or-death emergency measure having first been rushed
through, the Wood-Forbes Commission settled down to the details of
its task.</p>

<p>It visited practically every part of the archipelago and took
pains to see, listen to and consult with, every element of the
entire population. It displayed an amazing and sometimes rather a
disconcerting energy and ubiquity, and it found out a great
deal.</p>

<p>These findings, checked, re-checked, co-ordinated, boiled down
to the irreducible and softened to the verge of complaisance, it
presented to President Harding in what is commonly called &quot;The
Wood-Forbes Report.&quot;</p>

<p>Printed as a Congressional Document, this report is yet easily
available. Behind this report stands a great mass of documentation
in support, filed in our Federal archives.</p>

<p>The errand of the Wood-Forbes Mission, as defined by President
Harding at the start, was to determine whether President Wilson had
been well-informed when he told Congress <i><sup>1</sup></i> that
the Filipino people were ready and fit to receive complete
independence.</p>

<p class="sup"><sup>1</sup> Message of December 7, 1920.</p>

<p>The Wood-Forbes Mission&#39;s conclusions read, in part:</p>

<blockquote>...the experience of the past eight years, during which
they [the Filipinos] have had practical autonomy, has not been such
as to justify the people of the United States relinquishing
supervision of the Government of the Philippine
Islands...</blockquote>

<p>Its recommendations were few and brief. They are:</p>

<p><b>1.</b> We recommend that the present general status of the
Philippine Islands continue until the people have had time to
absorb and thoroughly master the powers already in their hands.</p>

<p><b>2.</b> We recommend that the responsible representative of
the United States, the Governor-General, have authority
commensurate with the responsibilities of his position. In case of
failure to secure the necessary corrective action by the Philippine
Legislature, we recommend that Congress declare null and void
legislation which has been enacted diminishing, limiting or
dividing the authority granted the Governor-General under act of
Congress No. 240 of the Sixty-fourth Congress, known as the Jones
Bill.</p>

<p><b>3.</b> We recommend that in case of a deadlock between the
Governor-General and the Philippine Senate in the confirmation of
appointments, the President of the United States be authorized to
make and render the final decision.</p>

<p><b>4.</b> We recommend that under no circumstance should the
American Government permit to be established in the Philippine
Islands a situation which would leave the United States in a
position of responsibility without authority.<br>
<br></p>

<p>Mr. Harrison, in quitting the Islands, is alleged frankly to
have celebrated the fact that he was &quot;leaving the
Governor-Generalship impossible for any Republican.&quot; He did
more than that&mdash;he left it &quot;impossible,&quot; in his
sense, for any American citizen.</p>

<p>The Wood-Forbes Report summed up its exposition of the matter in
the second and fourth paragraph of the recommendations just
quoted.</p>

<p>Having received the Wood-Forbes Report, President Hard-ing
turned to its joint author, Major-General Leonard Wood, and asked
him to undertake the actual rescue of the Philippines.</p>

<p>Now, Major-General Wood had but recently accepted the office of
President and Provost of the University of Pennsylvania,
practically a life position, offering him among his own young
countrymen at home a field of labour peculiarly dear to his heart.
And the service that President Harding now required of him meant
indefinite years of exile in a distant land at a heavy and uphill
task. But the General&#39;s own findings as to the needs of the
Islands and as to the policy demanded of America thereby, were the
grounds upon which Mr. Hard-ing stood in making the request.</p>

<p>What followed may be taken from the lips of one of the few who
really knew&mdash;Dr. Victor G. Heiser, Director of the East,
International Health Board, Rockefeller Foundation.</p>

<p>Dr. Heiser, as Chief Quarantine Officer of the Philippines from
1903 to 1905, as Director of Health for the Philippines from 1903
to 1915, and as a frequent visiting inspector on the
Foundation&#39;s behalf since the latter date, knows insular
conditions, history and personnel from inside out. He also knows
General Wood. And he thus describes what took place on the evening
before General Wood made known his final answer to the President of
the United States and to the University of Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>&quot;We were sitting there after dinner, on the verandah of
Malaca&ntilde;an,<sup>2</sup> with the mosquitoes biting our
ankles, the little breeze stirring the palm-leaves, and the muddy
river pushing along in the darkness beneath. We had been silent a
long time, smoking&mdash;just we two. And my thoughts had peered
into the future until I could stand it no more.&mdash;So, out of
sheer unhappiness, I intruded into another man&#39;s most private
affair.</p>

<p class="sup"><sup>2</sup> The name of the official residence of
the Governors-General of the Philippines.</p>

<p>&quot;&#39;General,&#39; I said, &#39;I&#39;m going to give you
my advice unasked; <i>I don&#39;t see how you can accept this
position.</i></p>

<p>&quot;&#39;If you do the job one hundred per cent perfectly it
will add nothing to your reputation, while anything short of that
will be seized upon by your opponents and will be used to your
hurt.</p>

<p>&quot;&#39;The presidency of the University of Pennsylvania
carries a comparatively large income&mdash;a furnished house and
other perquisites&mdash;against which there will be no charges.
Whereas, the salary of the Governor-General of the Philippine
Islands is only $18,000, of which you will have to spend so much to
meet the necessary expenses of Government House that you will be
literally working for nothing. You know, I know, every old-timer
here knows, that when you come to the Philippines you bury yourself
alive. The good you do is never realized at home. Daily lies will
be told against you. Your every act will be twisted to appear
actuated by ulterior motives. And you are too far away ever to
answer the slanders of those who vilify you. You will seriously
jeopardize your reputation without the possibility of gain to
yourself in name or fortune.&#39;</p>

<p>&quot;The General sat quiet for a few moments, looking off into
the dark. Then, knocking the ash from his cigar, he answered me in
words that burned themselves into my memory:</p>

<p>&quot;&#39;That is all true, Heiser. But I can&#39;t help
recognizing, and I hope I can say it without any egotism, that
there are very few of us Americans who have had experience in
governing dependencies. It so happens that I am one of those men. I
have been Governor-General of Cuba, Civil Governor of the Moro
Province, and Commanding General of the Philippine Division. And I
have travelled very extensively in British Colonies, where I have
studied the problems of administration.</p>

<p>&quot;&#39;If this Philippine experiment fails, although the
Filipinos are directly in charge of it, it will nevertheless go
down in history, and properly so, as an <i>American
failure.</i></p>

<p>&quot;&#39;Now, throughout my many years of public life, I have
always preached the duty of service to our country. I have preached
it both by the printed page and from the platform.</p>

<p>&quot;&#39;Well, then, I feel that right here I have an
opportunity to demonstrate to my fellow citizens that I meant what
I said. As the President is giving me the opportunity, I am going
to accept the position, regardless of what it costs me. And, come
what may, I shall stick to it to the end.</p>

<p>&quot;&#39;I am a poor man. Yes. That is true. But this is a
contribution to my country that I want to make.&#39;&quot;</p>

<hr class="short">

<p>So, on October 15, 1921, he started in&mdash;on as thankless a
job as ever a man undertook&mdash;started in with his eyes wide
open to the cost of it, knowing what lay ahead.</p>

<p>At that moment, it is said, a child might have played with the
lions of the Islands. They were not disposed to roar. In fact, they
were scared&mdash;so badly scared that even the fiercest among them
talked of retiring to the jungle as weary of public life.</p>

<p>The obvious thing for the new Executive to do would indeed have
been the thing they were all expecting&mdash;to make a clean sweep
of the installed machine and start afresh. But such was not the
purpose of the new Governor-General. His theory was that, since he
must handle these people anyway, in or out, it might as well be
in&mdash;that he would best work upon the material in hand with the
tools that lay readiest.</p>

<p>&quot;Weakling!&quot; cried the American old-timers in the
Islands, only half-seeing what he was at.</p>

<p>&quot;Milksop!&quot; cried they. &quot;Granny! Why doesn&#39;t
he get after the rascals and make them hunt their holes! Why
doesn&#39;t he swing the battle-axe?&quot;</p>

<p>But those who called for the battle-axe forgot just what Mr.
Harrison had chosen to forget&mdash;that the Governor-General of
the Philippines is bound to govern <i>under the law&mdash;</i>under
the Organic Act. The men whom they would have beheaded were
elective officers of an elected body.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, anyway, the Council of State <sup>3</sup> is a
mischievous excrescence,&quot; our old-timers
pursued,&mdash;&quot;The idea of tying the Governor-General up to
what may be a gang of conspirators against the public weal! That is
ridiculous! Let him begin by abolishing the Council of
State.&quot;</p>

<p class="sup"><sup>3</sup> The Council of State under the
Governor-General consisted of the Vice-Governor-General, the
President of the Senate, the Speaker of the House and the
Secretaries of the several Departments. It was created by executive
order of Mr. Harrison and was, whatever its other qualities, one of
the conspicuous examples of encroachment upon the prerogatives of
the United States Government, as defined in the Organic Act.</p>

<p>Now, the Council of State is indeed an extra-legal body without
authority for existence by the Organic Act. The Governor-General
probably could abolish it at will. Yet the fact remains that all
the mass of laws put through the Philippine Legislature in Mr.
Harrison&#39;s day is so thoroughly entangled with the Council of
State, the whole routine of administrative procedure so wound up in
it, as to be inextricable except by means of a major operation
performed by the United States Congress.</p>

<p>The heat of the Americans, however, was natural. They were not
all paragons, but they had done, as a whole, excellent work in the
Islands, extending trade and credit, opening the country, bettering
conditions everywhere, through many weary years. They had never
been rewarded by large profit. Not one of them had &quot;made a
fortune&quot; in any modern sense of the term. Yet they had
continued steady, enlightened labour. They had observed order under
many provocations. As Secretary Baker had so wisely foreseen, they
had nevertheless become the object of much unfair discrimination.
And they had never received, from any Insular administration, as
much consideration as they probably felt that their record
deserved.</p>

<p>And yet, the one thing first incumbent upon the new Executive
was not to jump in and clean the political stables, but to stop the
crevasse in the Treasury dyke&mdash;and to stop it quick. For the
eleventh hour was past and the twelfth far spent.</p>

<p>When General Wood took office the Government was bankrupt, with
a deficit of about $20,000,000 and no credit. And the peso stood at
17 per cent discount. There was no reserve fund and no confidence.
Business was dead. The bottom of all things was just about to drop
out.</p>

<p>But the peso, immediately on General Wood&#39;s appointment,
began to rise. His name plus the several financial measures that he
pushed through the Legislature made it possible to get from America
a new rescue loan of $22,500,000. And his two successive annual
budgets&mdash;those of 1922 and 1923&mdash;at last raised things to
the zero point, just as by skill and patience, by strength and
labour, a sunken ship is raised to the surface of the sea.</p>

<p>The money that had been lost was Filipino money, lost by
Filipinos. The rescue money was American money; for it may be taken
as an enduring fact that no Filipino buys his own, or any other
government&#39;s bonds&mdash;not while he can loan out his surplus
at fantastic rates of usury. And the man who now administered that
American rescue money was determined to stand watch over it and see
it do its rescue work.</p>

<p>&quot;The lid is down on the Treasury-box,&quot; said the new
Governor-General. &quot;It still can be opened by the lever of
sound investment and legal enterprise. But free and unsecured
circulation of public funds among political friends <i>is
finished.&quot;</i></p>

<p>&quot;This man lacks polish,&quot; murmured the
pol&iacute;ticos, one to the other. &quot;This is a rough and
tactless type. Militaristic. Brusque. How much more agreeable was
Mr. Harrison&#39;s smile!&quot;</p>

<p>Nevertheless, they did as they were bid. For, as has been said,
they were seriously, personally scared. They acquiesced in a
radical lopping of overgrown personnel throughout the departments;
in a reduction of the swarm of motor cars that everybody had voted
to everybody else; in the number and expenses of the insular ships;
in a considerable variety of other things until the sum of their
acquiescing amounted to a total reduction of 37 per cent in the
annual expense of the Islands.</p>

<p>And all this necessary work was helped&mdash;or so the
Governor-General hoped&mdash;by his conciliatory policy of
retaining the old cabinet that he had found in office upon his
arrival; of retaining the Council of State; and of labouring
diligently to maintain peaceful relations with the Legislature.</p>

<p>In the midst of which the curtain flew up on that amazing
<i>divertissement</i> entitled &quot;The Philippine National
Bank.&quot;</p>

<hr>
<a name="ch-10" id="ch-10"></a>
<h2>Chapter X &mdash; FOR THE TIRED BUSINESS MAN</h2>

<p>The Philippine National Bank was created in 1916, in the joyous
days of Harrison. The Philippine Legislature, in giving it birth,
endowed it with the right to issue notes, to do commercial business
and to invest not more than 50 per cent of its capital in
agricultural loans.</p>

<p>The Legislature then ordered into the coffers of its new
creation all municipal and provincial funds throughout the
archipelago, as well as all funds of the Insular Government,
withdrawing from other banks for the purpose.</p>

<p>Next, it imported from America Dr. H. Parker Willis, Secretary
of the U. S. Federal Reserve Board, and made him President of the
bank. Dr. Willis remained in office for nearly a year, gave much
good advice which was consistently ignored, and so departed. They
then put in, as President, Mr. Samuel Ferguson, American, a man
whose qualifications are said to have been that he had been
clerical secretary in Mr. Har-rison&#39;s office, without one
day&#39;s experience in banking. He died a year later. His
ignorance of banking was inclusive.</p>

<p>Mr. Ferguson having passed on, General Venancio
Concepci&oacute;n succeeded to the vacant chair. General
Concepci&oacute;n was a small Filipino politician with a shady
record. General Concepcion&#39;s further equipment for the post
equalled that of his predecessor, excepting for the facts that he
had had no clerkship in the Executive office and that he was
understood to be sober.</p>

<p>Dr. H. Parker Willis, in his brief day, had been able to insert
a few Americans into the bank personnel, but to these</p>

<p>General Concepci&oacute;n soon made a final end, leaving but one
lone survivor and he a subordinate.</p>

<p>This presently came to mean that an organization containing not
a single trained banker, not one single man familiar with bank
detail, was handling and investing $150,000,000 of values. And,
there being no bank examiners, no one was keeping check.</p>

<p>What happened, this vantage-ground once reached, has been
summarized as follows:</p>

<p>&quot;They (the Filipino pol&iacute;ticos) were like a child
with a new toy. They laughed and cried over it, hugged it and
kissed it, fondled it, rocked it to sleep and then woke it up and
jumped on it, banged it with a club, ripped it open and pulled the
stuffing out.&quot; <i><sup>1</sup></i></p>

<p class="sup"><sup>1</sup> Editorial in <i>The Far Eastern
Reviepu,</i> Shanghai, September, 1923, p. 583.</p>

<p>By the summer of 1919, rumours of this process reaching faraway
Washington led Mr. Newton D. Baker, Secretary of War, to authorize
a bank examination. He named for the task Mr. Francis Coates, Jr.,
Clearing-House examiner of Cleveland, Ohio, and despatched him to
Manila. Mr. Coates began his work on November 30, 1919, continued
it for four months and then fell ill. His report did not reach
Washington until September, 1920, and was then incomplete. It did
not cover, for example, the assets of agencies and branches
amounting to about $13,292,500.</p>

<p>As far as he had got, however, his findings were interesting. He
said, in part:</p>

<blockquote>The surplus and profits of the bank, aggregating
P6,196,42 8, are entirely wiped out by estimated losses aggregating
P10,697,166...The paid and subscribed capital of the bank is
P12,980,000, leaving a margin of capital unimpaired of P8,479,202,
against which is scheduled: slow, non-liquid and questionable
values, P8,-550,107, slow, non-liquid and problematical values
P6,926,530, and undetermined values of P8,728,353&mdash;a total of
P24,204,99O.<br>
<br>
In addition to this we have to consider that class of assets that
is scheduled as &quot;slow and non-liquid but ultimately solvent
values&quot; aggregating P25,311,119, and also non-liquidity
represented by the depletion of (and the necessary future
restoration of) the cash reserve fund amounting to P30,000,000, and
the certificate reserve fund (of the insular treasurer) amounting
to P80,000,000.</blockquote>

<p>Mr. Coates&#39;s report also showed that the bank&#39;s earning
accounts of surplus, reserve and undivided profit had been heavily
padded with sums of interest money that never had been collected
and that in all likelihood never could be collected. Regarding this
practice he said:</p>

<blockquote>The increasing of the assets by charging into them
accounts that are known to be worthless or...non-liquid,...can
spell but only one result&mdash;disaster.</blockquote>

<p>Mr. Coates&#39;s entire finding is one unbroken tale of
inefficiency, carelessness and mismanagement. The head office in
Manila, he discovered, knew little and cared less about the doings
of agencies and branches, of which there were forty-five in the
Islands. No proper statement of the affairs of the bank as a whole
had ever been made. Credit was extended in one department in entire
ignorance of what other departments knew or were doing. Loans were
made by branches the proceeds of which were used to pay loans due
at the head office. No scheme existed for any central knowledge and
control of the bank&#39;s business. As to the currency reserve,
this is what had happened:</p>

<p>For twelve years the carefully worked-out Philippine currency
system established in 1903 by the Congress of the United States had
worked well, and the trust funds behind it, &mdash;some $40,000,000
gold, had been duly maintained in New York. Scarcely had the
Philippine National Bank opened its doors, however, when a steady
raid upon that gold reserve started. Defying the basic rules of
currency law, the trust funds in New York were now juggled into the
grasp of the bank, which immediately transferred them to Manila and
proceeded to pour them out into the hands of its friends.</p>

<p>&quot;The stupidity of the transaction is almost unequalled in
the annals of finance,&quot; says a later investigator. But it
cannot in justice be overlooked that while this wholesale raid upon
the people&#39;s funds was being committed by a handful of excited
Malays, too untaught to be deeply blamed, an American
Governor-General charged with responsibility for the entire
Islands&#39; welfare sat by and watched, inactive. Or that
Washington, whose business it was, by silence gave assent.</p>

<blockquote>As a result, the currency system later broke down
completely and the Government, in a vain attempt to supply gold in
New York against which exchange might be sold, diverted other trust
funds from their legal usage, and, besides, borrowed large sums
from the United States treasury. Herein lies largely the
explanation for the necessity of increasing the indebtedness of the
Islands by some $45,000,000.<sup>2</sup></blockquote>

<p class="sup"><sup>2</sup> Wright-Martin <i>Report,</i> rendered
November 20, 1922.</p>

<p>Mr. Coates, in his Report, paused in sorrow to recall the high
ideals that Dr. Willis had set before the bank at its birth,
&mdash;and then pointed out the spectacle afforded by that
institution&mdash;an institution of a size demanding the acme of
skill in handling&mdash;now under a president &quot;inexperienced
in banking and in the financial world of the white
man&mdash;unsupported by a single officer or director who had the
necessary experience and contact, and manned with a crew of
natives&mdash;neophytes in the details of the game.&quot;</p>

<p>Loans, Mr. Coates found, had been freely granted in complete
disregard of credit considerations. Politics and private
friendships, the only keys to the vaults, had amply sufficed to
open them wide&mdash;or to seal them tight. Assets, once acquired,
had been looked after and protected with extreme carelessness and
procrastination. And the examiner&#39;s search revealed loans in
the sum of $4,139,176.50 as to whose solvency the bank&#39;s
records contained no information.</p>

<p>One characteristic incident was the approval by Vicente Singson
Encarnaci&oacute;n and his fellow-directors of the Philippine
National Bank of loans from the bank aggregating $514,252, made in
favour of the Compa&ntilde;&iacute;a Naviera de Filipinas. Of this
company Bank Director Vicente Singson Encarnaci&oacute;n was both
President and substantial stockholder. The loans were asked for the
purchase of three boats. Interest on the amount increased the
company&#39;s debt to $674,159.78. To liquidate, the boats were
sold for $197,416.44&mdash;the best price they would
bring&mdash;and the bank lost the difference. Article 35 of the
Bank Act reads:</p>

<blockquote>The National Bank shall not, directly or indirectly,
grant loans to any of the members of the Board of Directors of the
National Bank...</blockquote>

<p>Nevertheless, many of the Directors of the bank were found to
be, themselves, among the heaviest debtors.</p>

<p>It was not, however, until the summer of 1924 that
Governor-General Wood&#39;s urgency was able to break through the
dead-line of political resistance and secure filing of actions
against Directors of the Bank, among whom was Mr. Archibald
Harrison, the late Governor-General&#39;s brother. These actions
were brought to recover losses suffered by the Government through
the Directors&#39; malfeasance or through their failure or neglect
to comply with the law.</p>

<p>In defiance of the law, about $3,625,000 had been loaned to
interests owned and controlled entirely or in part of directors of
the bank, of which loan over a third at least was dead loss.</p>

<p>Thus Messrs. Singson Encarnaci&oacute;n, Vicente Madrigal and
Ram&oacute;n J. Fernandez,<sup>3</sup> in their capacity of
Directors of the Philippine National Bank, lent to themselves in
their capacity of stockholders in three several companies, the sum
of $2,-150,000; after which operation the companies went insolvent.
In two other corporations that borrowed heavily from the National
Bank to the bank&#39;s disastrous loss, not only Directors Madrigal
and Fernandez, but also the President of the bank himself, General
Venancio Concepci&oacute;n, were stockholders. And in February and
March, 1919, the firm of Fernandez Brothers, of which Director
Ram&oacute;n J. Fernandez is senior partner, with Director Vicente
Madrigal, took from the bank $1,105,420.64, giving as security
39,000 bales of hemp valued at $32 per bale. The price of hemp
fell, and the bank lost about $850,000 on that one transaction.</p>

<p class="sup"><sup>3</sup> Mr. Fernandez&mdash;it is said on the
insistence of Mr. Quezon&mdash;subsequently was sent to the Senate,
in the 1923 election and is now senator.</p>

<p>Of this last affair, Governor-General Harrison is quoted as
saying, when the record was spread before him:</p>

<p>&quot;It is the most pitiful story I ever heard.&quot;</p>

<p>Mr. Harrison, however, was about to slip out forever from under
the ruin whose burden the innocent millions of the Filipino people
must bear these many years to come. His successor pro tern,
Acting-Governor Yeater, was then free to cable the Secretary of
War:</p>

<blockquote>In my judgment, the National Bank may be summarized as
drifting with an undisciplined crew, without rudder, compass or
captain. The last American leaves this month. The bank needs a
manager and heads of departments with bank experience and financial
instincts. Stock has declined to 40. Believe bank solvent, but
merely on faith, without seeing or knowing.</blockquote>

<p>Meantime, in view of the report of Mr. Coates, Washington had
taken matters into its own hands to the extent of sending out to
the bank an experienced manager, Mr. E. W. Wilson of San Francisco,
who arrived early in January, 1921, and assumed the task assigned
him.</p>

<p>Then, in March, 1921, came the change of Administration in
Washington and Mr. Harding&#39;s inauguration, closely followed by
the despatch of the Wood-Forbes Commission to diagnose affairs in
the Philippines.</p>

<p>And one of the earlier features of that Commission&#39;s work
was the tackling of the mysteries of the Philippine National Bank
by the well-known New York firm of Haskins and Sells, certified
public accountants.</p>

<p>Messrs. Haskins and Sells&#39;s preliminary report, first fruit
of an examination lasting over a year, showed that &quot;the
investment made by the Philippine Government in the capital stock
of the Philippine National Bank has been completely lost...[and]
that the bank has operated...in violation of every principle which
prudence, intelligence or even honesty could dictate.&quot;</p>

<p>This final report, rendered May 19, 1921, set the principal
losses at a total of $37,544,500.</p>

<p>The details, aside from private &quot;accommodations,&quot;
included such features as the setting up of the Manila Railroad
Company, the Manila Hotel Company, the National Development Company
as financial feeder to the National Coal Company, the Ceb&uacute;
Portland Cement Company, etc., etc. To Cocoanut Oil Companies
alone, among the varied crop sprung up under the bank&#39;s genial
influence like mushrooms on an autumn night, had been granted loans
aggregating $25,905,000 against $10,-500,000 assets.</p>

<p>On these latter industries Haskins and Sells commented:</p>

<blockquote>The manufacturing costs submitted for the year 1920
indicate that at the present price for oil and copra most of these
companies cannot earn sufficient to pay the interest on the bank
loans...unless radical improvements are effected.</blockquote>

<p>Yet copra, in 1920, reached the peak price of its
history&mdash;$15, gold, per picul, as against about $4.87 in 1914,
$6.25 in 1921 and $6 in 1922.</p>

<p>The seven sugar centrals newly built and financed by the bank
showed a similar record.</p>

<p>Among other details, Messrs. Haskins and Sells reported:</p>

<blockquote>The foreign department operated under the supervision
of the Vice-Pr&eacute;sident (M. S. Concepci&oacute;n, son of the
President) was found to be conducted very inefficiently and
dishonestly, necessitating criminal action against the heads of the
department. The collection department records were also in bad
shape. Many overdue bills had accumulated, and, as a result of the
laxity in the department, considerable losses have accrued to the
bank. The accounting of the bank generally has been extremely bad.
Even where proper records had been devised they were generally
carelessly and inaccurately kept. There was no record to show the
total liability of any customer...</blockquote>

<p>As to the exchange losses of the Shanghai branch:</p>

<blockquote>These losses were the result of entirely unnecessary
and purely speculative operations in exchange by the manager, Mr.
J. W. Miller, a man with no banking experience who, very ill
advisedly, was placed in charge of the branch in Shanghai, where
other foreign banks place their most experienced exchange
bankers.<br>
<br>
The settlement of these operations involved a loss of about
P13,-000,000...Details of these transactions were placed in the
hands of the United States district attorney for appropriate
action, but no prosecution resulted because of the inability to get
Mr. Miller within the jurisdiction of the court.</blockquote>

<p>Thus an institution whose assets had actually made it one of the
biggest banks in the world showed, after five years&#39; operation
by home talent, first, the loss of the entire capital stock, or
$17,650,000, of which the Government owned $16,-000,000; second,
the loss of over half its total insular deposits; third, the tying
up in frozen loans of all its assets over and above its losses;
and, fourth, hopeless insolvency.</p>

<p>In a word, having hugged their toy and kissed it and rocked it
to sleep, the children had indeed banged it with a club, ripped it
open and finally pulled the stuffing out.</p>

<p>Their only embarrassment, indeed, had lain in the question of
finding sufficient pretexts for laying hands upon the vaults.</p>

<p>But, fertile ever in curious expedients, they had hit upon the
plan of sending forth emissaries into highways and byways to drum
up more borrowers.</p>

<p>Said one of these who had penetrated to the manager of a
business concern in a distant province:</p>

<p>&quot;I represent the National Bank, and we wonder if you
wouldn&#39;t like to borrow some money from us.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don&#39;t need anything now,&quot; replied the manager,
as one might speak to a wandering lightning-rod man or a
book-agent.</p>

<p>&quot;But listen&mdash;we could let you have 500,000 pesos just
as well as not,&quot; urged the applicant.</p>

<p>Twenty million dollars were thus loaned by the bank to private
individuals wherewith to do business on taxpayers&#39; money in
competition with men working on normal business lines and financing
themselves.</p>

<p>And it is an interesting fact that $20,000,000 is, according to
the figures of the American Chamber of Commerce, just about half
the amount annually taken from the pockets of the people of the
United States and presented as a free gift to the people of the
Philippine Islands in the form of remission of customs dues on
Philippine goods entering American markets.</p>

<p>It is understood that one loan of about $50,000 made direct to
Mr. Quezon without security, on being uncovered by the examiner,
was very quickly paid up by certain of the directors. But
indirection, rather than straight personal &quot;loans&quot; to
themselves, appears to have been the more usual means by which the
Big Caciques and their henchmen made private profits.</p>

<p>Haskins and Sells&#39;s final report, as of May 19, 1921,
reached Manila about mid-June, 1922, when General Wood had already
been nine months Governor-General of the Philippines. And the
Governor-General, in view of the startling nature of the document,
deemed it advisable to have its findings checked.</p>

<p>He accordingly appointed Special Bank Examiner Benjamin F.
Wright and National Bank Examiner L. H. Martin, both men of mature
experience and training, to go back once more over the ground and
make a thorough revaluation of the bank&#39;s assets.</p>

<p>The Wright-Martin report, as of June 30, 1922, covered a period
of a year and a half in which Secretary Baker&#39;s envoy, Mr. E.
W. Wilson, had been the Bank&#39;s Manager.</p>

<p>The administration had been re-organized. The President and
General Manager, the Vice-president and Assistant General Manager,
the Manager of the Foreign Department, the Assistant Chief of the
Note-Teller Department, the Manager of the Iloilo Branch, the
Manager of the Aparri Branch, as well as various subordinates, had
all been prosecuted and convicted of embezzlement and other
criminal offences. Four Americans of banking experience had been
introduced into the concern. The bank&#39;s securities, where
possible, had been put into better shape. But the bank, under Mr.
Wilson&#39;s management, was still running as a feeder to the
Government-owned businesses. And, as the new report put it:</p>

<blockquote>In order to meet the demands of the Government for the
return of the deposits and in order . .. [to] advance large sums to
the sugar centrals, sugar planters and oil interests, the liquid
loans of the bank have been collected, its United States bonds
largely sold, its cash holdings reduced to an unsafe minimum,
balances due from other banks called in... practically no reserves
are held for its P32,000,000 circulation and P81,500,000 deposits,
while the assets remaining are...frozen...<br>
<br>
Government necessity, and the policy of the management in
reinvesting proceeds of liquidation in the hope of &quot;working
out&quot; its frozen assets, together with its tremendous losses,
have brought about a condition under which the bank is now
operating at a loss in doing practically nothing but financing the
affairs of debtors...in various states of insolvency...<br>
<br>
...These debtors...are largely responsible for such feeling as
exists, that the bank must be kept indefinitely in business...It
was only through sheer ignorance of banking principles that they
were set up in business in the first place...and it is little less
than criminal to continue them in business with government
funds...</blockquote>

<p>The Wright-Martin report points out the scandal of a bank
practically owned by the Government hopelessly insolvent; operating
at a loss; operating, therefore, in open and flagrant violation of
the law that the Government compels private banks to observe.</p>

<p>It continues:</p>

<blockquote>...The bank has been legally and morally dead for at
least two years, though it has been necessary to inject into its
palsied body a semblance of life, on account of its and the
Government&#39;s inability to repay the immense loan from the
people in the form of its outstanding circulation...[and] to
restore individual...provincial and municipal
deposits...</blockquote>

<p>And among its conclusions stands this statement with which it
quotes the agreement of Mr. Robert F. Herrick, of Massachusetts,
who has also examined the Insular finances:</p>

<blockquote>...Nothing is to be gained by keeping up a false
pretence...The bank at the present time is not functioning as a
bank...There is nothing which cannot be gained by closing it to the
public and converting it into a special corporation for the gradual
liquidation of its frozen assets.</blockquote>

<p>Meantime, the Philippine Legislature had not remained entirely
quiescent as to the affairs of its offspring. As far back as
December 7, 1920, Representative Claro M. Recto, minority leader of
the house, rose to attack a majority bill providing for raising the
bank&#39;s capital. Mr. Recto stated that he and five other members
of the House Committee on Banks and Corporations had joined in a
request to the President of the National Bank for a copy of the
Coates report, but were refused so much as a sight
thereof&raquo;</p>

<p>&quot;I thought it useless,&quot; said Mr. Recto, &quot;to call
upon the Governor-General [Harrison] and the Secretary of
Finance...because these officers would shield themselves, as did
the president of the bank, behind legal pretexts.&quot;
<sup>4</sup></p>

<p class="sup"><sup>4</sup> Philippines <i>Free Press,</i>
September 1, 1923.</p>

<p>Mr. Recto complains that he and his associates are asked to vote
to raise the bank&#39;s capitalization from twenty million pesos to
fifty million pesos, appropriating the sum from Insular funds, in
order to maintain Government control of the institution; and yet
they are flatly refused any knowledge of that institution&#39;s
status. He goes on:</p>

<blockquote>Criticism of the bank must have gone beyond the borders
of the archipelago and must have produced alarm in high places
...to induce the War Department to send here a special commissioner
to make a thorough investigation...When this gentleman [Mr. Coates]
left the Islands...without disclosing his conclusions, a storm of
conjecture was aroused...[but] to-day his report is a mystery to
all but two or three men...</blockquote>

<p>And Mr. Recto further indicates his observation that the bank
exists to serve as a political campaign tool for the Big Caciques;
that the immediate result of its operations has been the piling up
of a few big fortunes impossible of honest explanation; that, as to
its services to agriculture, it has helped no farmer save only
district caciques controlling votes; and that, as to commerce, it
has aided only such business men as repay favours.</p>

<p>Neither eloquence nor accusation, however, sufficed to produce
the document. The control of the Big Caciques was supreme.</p>

<p>Mr. E. W. Wilson, it will be remembered, arrived from America to
take over the bank&#39;s managership in January, 1921 &mdash;some
two months before Mr. Harrison&#39;s departure. It is credibly
alleged that he came out under instructions from Washington to
&quot;keep the lid on.&quot; And, whatever the main purpose of such
instructions, if such he had, it is obvious that their observance
would operate powerfully to &quot;save face&quot; for the Big
Caciques.</p>

<p>It is a gauge, then, of their capacity to realize the nature of
their own deeds and condition, that they should now permit a
movement in House and Senate to pull open Mr. Wilson&#39;s
stewardship of the bank, and thus with one hand to expose the very
thing over which the other held the veil.</p>

<p>This movement, based on &quot;alleged abuses, irregularities and
injustices committed in the employment of experts...with fabulous
and exorbitant salaries&quot; was, in fact, merely an attack on the
re-installment of Americans in the bank&#39;s staff.</p>

<p>Mr. Wilson, in a letter addressed to several members of the
Legislature, met the demonstration with a perfectly human outburst
of downright speech. He said:</p>

<blockquote>I came here under contract...This contract is definite
and plain. I have put no one in the bank that was not originally
contemplated and specified by this contract and duly approved by
the board of directors of the bank.<br>
<br>
If you desire to investigate the bank, let me suggest that there is
no information that you cannot get by calling here...Coates&#39;s
Report and Haskins and Sells&#39;s Report are the most astonishing
documents that have been presented concerning any bank in any part
of the world during the last generation. The less publicity they
get, the better for the bank, the Philippine Government and the
Philippine Islands...It is not necessary to hunt quail with a brass
band...</blockquote>

<p>The letter appeared in the Manila <i>Bulletin</i> on November
14, 1922. Six days later Mr. Benjamin F. Wright placed the
Wright-Martin report in the hands of the Governor-General.</p>

<p>Governor-General Wood now desired to send the Wright-Martin
report, in a Special Message, to the Legislature. This in order
that the widest discussion and study might be brought to it and
that its lesson might be learned by the greatest possible number of
the people.</p>

<p>Before doing so, however, he sent for Mr. Quezon, President of
the Senate, and Mr. Roxas, Speaker of the House, showed them his
covering message and asked them if they could suggest any
alterations that would make their medicine easier to take.</p>

<p>&quot;I don&#39;t want to hurt you any more than I must,&quot;
he said.</p>

<p>Both men read the General&#39;s message through, having done
which, they said that they could take no exceptions to any part of
it.</p>

<p>Then they went back to their respective seats as President of
the Senate and Speaker of the House, as such received the message
in due form, and instantly locked it away in their desks.</p>

<p>Locked it away so completely that until, late in August, 1923, a
species of accident enabled the Governor-General to release the
message to the press, the majority of the members of the
Legislature remained unaware of its very existence.</p>

<p align="center"><a name="ill-12" id="ill-12"></a><img src=

<p>The immediate result of the release was significant. The leading
Filipino dailies burst forth in blasts of fury&mdash;but at
what?</p>

<p>At the heavy financial blow to the country? At the national loss
of credit before the world? At the reflection upon Filipino
capacity? At the criminals who did the deed? At the self-helpful
directors? At the Big Caciques who had engineered the whole scheme?
At the American Executive who consented to their banditry?&mdash;No
and no. Their wrath was for none of these, but all for one single
man whom they accused of black spite and of an autocratic design to
destroy the life of the country. Their wrath&mdash;the whole of
it&mdash;was poured out upon the present Governor-General of the
Islands.</p>

<p>And the bank&#39;s Board of Directors themselves hastened
solemnly to record their condemnation of General Wood&#39;s action
as &quot;showing ignorance of the principles which govern
commercial practices in the civilized world.&quot;</p>

<p>The Governor-General&#39;s Special Message on the Bank,
containing the Wright-Martin report with its summary of those of
Messrs. Coates and Haskins and Sells, was now given all the
publicity that any document can attain in a country 63 per cent
illiterate. And it is not without significance as to the moral
development of the people, that the standing and power of the Big
Caciques was in no wise thereby stained or weakened.</p>

<p>In the words already so often repeated:&mdash;There is no public
opinion in the Philippine Islands. The United States of America has
bank-looters and public thieves in high places. But the people of
the United States, once informed of the offence, pull down the
offender. In the stage as yet attained by the Filipino no offence
is felt.</p>

<p>As to the gauge of business intelligence afforded by the
event:</p>

<p>Even to this day the Filipino is rare indeed who can descry any
connection between, on the one hand, the bank&#39;s operations,
and, on the other, the Government&#39;s depleted treasury and the
lack of means for public work. Few, indeed, are the Filipinos who
recognize wisdom or justice in the Governor-General&#39;s continued
pressure thus expressed in his Message to the Legislature of
1923:</p>

<blockquote>I recommend, as the Government owns 92 per cent of the
stock, that the Legislature take the necessary steps to put the
bank in the position which the law requires and that it finally
assume responsibility for the bank, its assets and
liabilities.</blockquote>

<p>The Philippine National Bank to-day operates insolvent, steadily
increasing its deficit, without legal reserves and with no way of
acquiring them, still under political control, still running as a
solvent bank upon the proceeds of liquidation.</p>

<p>And under these very conditions, as late as March 8, 1924, a
bill was passed by both houses of the Legislature again
appropriating to the ordinary uses of the Philippine National Bank
the sum of $12,428,000, practically the whole reserve fund of the
Government.</p>

<p>Governor-General Wood vetoed the bill.</p>

<p>The Filipino press thereupon raised an outcry against the
American Executive&#39;s malice toward the great national
institution.</p>

<p>Mr. Quezon, in a public address delivered at Silay, Occidental
Negros, June, 1923, put volumes in one phrase when he said:</p>

<blockquote>The Governor-General, in the use of his executive
powers, may order the closing of the bank, but I can assure you
that while there is money in the treasury the Philippine
Legislature will open another bank.</blockquote>

<p>There you have it.</p>

<h2>Chapter XI &mdash; THE ROTTENEST THING</h2>

<p>When Major-General Leonard Wood was commissioned by the United
States of America to assume the government of the Philippine
Islands, explicit instructions went with the job.</p>

<p>Among these instructions stood orders to get the Philippine
Government out of business just as quickly as was possible without
unnecessary sacrifice.</p>

<p>That is, the new Executive was directed to make all haste to
clean up the Insular Government&#39;s wild-cat investments, working
them as nearly as might be into presentable shape; and then to
arrange sales of the properties&mdash;or else to arrange leases
until sales could be effected.</p>

<p>Meantime, and all the time he was &quot;to prevent their being
interfered with by the political element.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In other words,&quot; said Mr. Weeks, Secretary of War,
writing on September 19, 1921, &quot;the management of the several
investments should be made as independent of political control as
it is possible to make them.&quot;</p>

<p>These instructions are clear and definite. They sound sufficient
and seem to warrant a demand for results.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, what happened?</p>

<p>By way of beginning somewhere, take the case of the Manila
Railroad Company.</p>

<p>The Manila Railroad, 645 miles of trackage, had been purchased
from private owners by the Philippine Government in the days of
Harrison.</p>

<p>During the last two years of Mr. Quezon&#39;s presidency of this
Railroad Company&mdash;an office that Governor-General Wood induced
him to resign&mdash;one hundred and fifty thousand free passes were
issued, each pass valid for travel anywhere on the road throughout
the year whose date it bore and good not only for the recipient
himself, but also for all his family and all his dependents.</p>

<p>Another useful feature was the presidential perquisite of
issuing railway contracts, as for coaling, to rich and good
personal friends&mdash;of pushing them across the table, like bread
cast upon the waters, without the formality of preliminary
bids.</p>

<p>With these things in mind as indications of the general policy
pursued, it will be found not unnatural that the Manila Railroad
Company has yearly lost money&mdash;money which the insular
treasury must yearly supply.</p>

<p>Its annual reports, in their balance sheets, show net profits,
to be sure.</p>

<p>But the road has never yet paid a dividend on the stock, has put
away scarcely any reserve, has written off practically nothing for
depreciation, and has never been able to pay so much as the
interest on its own government-guaranteed bonds.</p>

<p>Meantime, the Insular Government, by yearly renewed special
legislation, has been waiving the company&#39;s taxes in order to
help it make a political display.</p>

<p>This, in brief, is still the status of the Manila Railroad
Company. And the ablest of the Filipino economists have written
statements for the American press to prove it a status of financial
success.</p>

<p>Now, as to the sugar centrals:</p>

<p>The sugar centrals had cost the people of the Philippines,
through their National Bank, from twenty-three to twenty-four
million dollars. By the time of General Wood&#39;s inauguration the
plants had greatly deteriorated in value, through mishandling and
neglect, and the business itself was kept alive only by advance
crop loans of the people&#39;s money, each year renewed and each
year more hopeless of recovery.</p>

<p>This in spite of high sugar prices and of the fact that
Philippine sugar enjoys a practical subsidy from the United States
of America, where almost the entire crop is sold.</p>

<p>The sugar exported to the United States in the year 1922, if
duties had been levied upon it in accordance with the rates of the
United States Tariff Act of 1922, would have paid about eleven
million, eight hundred and sixteen thousand dollars into the United
States Treasury.</p>

<p>The other Government enterprises showed practically identical
conditions. Senators and representatives composed their
directorates. And these directorates, interlocking till none could
find head or tail among them, formed busy bucket-lines to the
money-tap in the National Bank. One single copra mill drew a
&quot;loan&quot; of $11,500,000 in a single year.</p>

<p>While the war lasted everybody splashed. When the war stopped,
<i>tableau!</i></p>

<p>Such, roughly, was the state of affairs that Governor-General
Wood stepped in upon with explicit orders from Washington to
&quot;get the Government out of business.&quot;</p>

<p>And the new Executive, confronting his problem, saw that all
these grisly skeletons&mdash;railway, sugar centrals and the rest,
represented honest opportunities to fill honest needs; and that, by
honest and capable operators, they could still be made rich assets
to the people of the Islands.</p>

<p>So he fell to work and presently was able to secure from
first-class American operating companies a most gratifying response
in the form of proposals to handle the railroad and the sugar
centrals and to turn them from continuous losers into good money
makers for the Philippine Government. To give the details of the
proposals would be too burdensome here, particularly as an
intelligent statement would necessitate a mass of statistics
showing local conditions as affecting the practical significance of
the figures. Suffice it, then, to say that in each case the terms,
as far as the businesses themselves were concerned, gave occasion
for sincere congratulation to the Philippine Government.</p>

<p>Now perhaps you suppose that at this juncture the Big Caciques
felt like men starving on an iceberg in the Polar Sea who should
suddenly sight the <i>Mauretania</i> heaving around the corner. But
the truth appears to be that even the wisest among them had no real
understanding of the condition to which they had reduced their
country. All they could see was their slipping grip on their own
toy.</p>

<p>For the conditions of the proposed contracts included one point
that ruined all the rest. It absolutely precluded any and all
outside interference with the running of the concerns, whether in
&quot;hiring and firing&quot; or in other operating procedures.</p>

<p>A mass of patronage, with all its political possibilities, to
lie lost in the hands of professional operators! Never!</p>

<p>These evil days would pass. This too active Governor-General
would go home. Meantime, let not the curse of scientific management
companies gain foothold in the land and acquire rights and backing
from the United States Government.</p>

<p>What, then, should be done?</p>

<p>But lack of expedients is never the caciques&#39; difficulty.
They rushed to the house-tops.</p>

<p>&quot;Our country&#39;s resources to be given away to
foreigners!&quot; they cried abroad. &quot;Patriots, awake! Shall
the wealth of our fair Philippines be abandoned to the exploitation
of the American Trusts? This man&mdash;this Wood&mdash;this
Autocrat&mdash;he is a creature of the Trusts. Do not believe him.
He is trying to pay his own old political debts with the heritage
of our children!&quot;</p>

<p>Meantime, while the right popular atmosphere and background was
thus being manufactured, they held in their hands a simple little
tool prepared under Mr. Harrison&#39;s supervision for just such
emergencies.</p>

<p>They held the Board of Control, whose power sufficed neatly and
completely to cancel the Governor-General&#39;s entire labours
toward reconstructing their country&#39;s fortune.</p>

<p>They refused the American proposals. And they left the railroad,
the centrals and all the rest of the sorry lot to run as they run,
until, perhaps, future events shall make their handling more
interesting.</p>

<p>Meantime the Philippine National Government, in the matter of
finance, and by dint of all the Governor-General&#39;s rigorous
expense-cutting and leak-stopping, was just barely keeping its nose
above water.</p>

<p>Now the Board of Control is a thing but little heard of outside
the Islands. Propaganda books on the Philippines and on
America&#39;s relation thereto have a way either of failing to
describe it or else of gliding over the spot, omitting its
name.</p>

<p>And yet, more than any other one thing, it demands the attention
of the American people, if the American people seriously intend to
discharge their duties toward the people of the Islands.</p>

<p>The Board of Control consists of three members only: The
Governor-General as chairman, the President of the Senate, and the
Speaker of the House, each with an equal vote. In the hands of the
Board of Control lies the appointment of the boards of directors of
all Government business enterprises. It controls the voting power
and the policies of all Government corporations&mdash;bank,
railroad, sugar centrals, all. It controls the allotment of all
funds for public works and improvements. It controls the $1,500,000
annual emergency fund, etc., etc., and finally, under present
political conditions, its two native members absolutely control
both Houses of Legislature, their attitude and their acts.</p>

<p>The Board of Control, therefore, having two votes to the
Governor-General&#39;s one, can overrule him anywhere in the wide
field of its jurisdiction. It is a purely political body and it
wholly dominates the business affairs of the Insular
Government.</p>

<p>These are the conditions under which our Secretary of War
directed General Wood not only to &quot;get the Government out of
business,&quot; but also to keep Government business
&quot;independent of political control.&quot;</p>

<p>These are the conditions under which America asks her envoy to
risk his personal honour in the desperate attempt to uphold her
credit in the Orient.</p>

<p>To these conditions Mr. Roxas, Speaker of the House and member
of the Board of Control, thus pointed in a public speech delivered
in Manila on September 9, 1923:</p>

<blockquote>[We] have encroached on the powers and prerogatives of
the Governor-General. That is true. We have encroached upon the
rights of the Governor-General because in that guise liberties are
won.</blockquote>

<p>And, finally, these are the conditions under which Mr. Quezon,
President of the Senate and second member of the Board of Control,
dared to say, on September 9, 1923, before four thousand students
of the University of the Philippines:</p>

<blockquote>I am betraying no secret if I tell you that our
ultimate aim...is to make of the Governor-General of the
Philippines a mere figurehead. It is unpatriotic for any Filipino
to stand by Governor Wood...</blockquote>

<p>The Board of Control exists, not by authority of, but in
defiance of, the Organic Act of the Islands. The Jones Law, as
Secretary Baker, in transmitting it, took the utmost care to point
out, was designed by Congress not to decrease the power of the
Governor-General, but materially to increase that power, and, with
it, the Governor-General&#39;s responsibility. As already quoted,
it expressly provides</p>

<blockquote>that all executive functions of the Government must be
directly under the Governor-General or within one of the Executive
departments under the supervision and control of the
Governor-General</blockquote>

<p>&mdash;a provision that, as Mr. Baker earnestly re-emphasized,
was specifically made to prevent the encroachments of the past.</p>

<p>The creation of the Board of Control was a piece of pure
outlawry. Its existence to-day is an affront to the dignity of
America.</p>

<p>Why, then, does not a Governor-General of the Islands who is
stopped in his sworn duty by this thing, just as any succeeding
Governor-General who shall endeavor to do his sworn duty will
surely be stopped thereby&mdash;why does not he abolish the Board
of Control? This is why:<br>
<br></p>

<p>1. The Jones Bill is the Organic Law of the Islands.</p>

<p>2. Under the Jones Bill, the Governor-General may veto new
legislation; but he has no power to annul laws already enacted.</p>

<p>3. That power&mdash;to annul laws already enacted&mdash;rests
squarely with the Congress of the United States of America.</p>

<p>4. The Wood-Forbes Report, rendered December 31, 1921,
explicitly recommended that Congress &quot;declare null and void
legislation which has been enacted diminishing, limiting or
dividing the authority granted the Governor-General...[in] the
Jones Bill.&quot;</p>

<p>5. Presidents and Congresses have consistently ignored this
recommendation and have taken no action in the matter.</p>

<p>6. Nothing that Filipino politicians may do in the way of
lawlessness can entitle an American Governor-General to override
the Act of the United States Congress under which he himself is
commissioned by America to rule the Islands.<br>
<br></p>

<p>Yet in reviewing with Filipino pol&iacute;ticos the history of
the attempt to &quot;get the Government out of business&quot; I was
repeatedly informed that the Governor-General would have
accomplished that purpose had he more sympathetically handled the
men with whom he had to deal.</p>

<p>&quot;The Governor-General could have put it over,&quot; said
one of the most experienced of them all. &quot;He could have got
the Government concerns into American operating companies&#39;
hands. But he went about it the wrong way. He would permit nothing
to be done on the quiet&mdash;you understand? He even talked to the
Press about his whole scheme and wanted general discussion. That
doesn&#39;t interest us at all. That isn&#39;t politics. That
isn&#39;t our way.&quot;</p>

<p>Meantime, certain definite points exist that should not escape
careful consideration in America.</p>

<p>First:&mdash;The people of the United States, it will be
remembered, took up the entire issue of bonds authorized by
Congress at the hurry call of the Wood-Forbes Commission to rescue
the Philippine Government from actual ruin. Governor-General Wood,
on the issue of these bonds, made a most earnest appeal to the
Filipinos themselves to prove their patriotism by something more
substantial than oratory. &quot;Don&#39;t pay another country for
the use of money you could and should put up yourselves,&quot; he
urged. &quot;Show your public spirit as other peoples do. Show
yourself a nation. Take up your own Government loan.&quot;</p>

<p>But, whatever their reasons, they subscribed not one dollar.</p>

<p>Consequently, their government to-day is to a large extent
sustained by the money of private citizens of the United States of
America. As a result each year sees four million
dollars<sup>1</sup> taken from a meagre exchequer and sent to the
United States, in order to cover the service of loans, including
interest payments and sinking funds.<sup>2</sup></p>

Philippine Islands for 1923.</p>

<p class="sup"><sup>2</sup> Statement by Bureau of Insular Affairs,
War Department.</p>

<p>Second:&mdash;Civic responsibility is a sentiment yet to be born
in the mestizo cacique breast. Mr. Chief Justice Taft, sixteen
years ago, wrote of the Filipino of his day:</p>

<p>&quot;The idea that a public office is a public trust had not
been implanted in the Filipino mind by experience, and the
conception that an officer who fails in his duty, by embezzlement
or otherwise, was violating an obligation that he owed to each
individual member of the public, he found it difficult to
grasp.&quot; <sup>3</sup></p>

<p class="sup"><sup>3</sup> Special Report on the Philippines to
the President, by Wm. H. Taft, Secretary of War, January 23, 1908,
p. 32.</p>

<p>A cameo proof that sixteen years of education have not sufficed
to alter that standard may be seen in the fact that General
Venancio Concepci&oacute;n, the first Filipino appointed by the Big
Caciques to the presidency of the Philippine National
Bank,<sup>4</sup> had already been convicted of fraud committed at
an earlier opportunity.</p>

<p class="sup"><sup>4</sup> General Concepci&oacute;n is now in
prison for his conduct of that office.</p>

<p>Third:&mdash;Mr. Newton D. Baker, Secretary of War, was keenly
alive to this characteristic when he wrote <sup>5</sup> to
Governor-General Harrison, in his letter of caution against
political piracies upon the Jones Bill, a particularly grave
warning against attacks upon the auditor&#39;s office. Any move in
this direction, on the part of the Philippine Legislature, will be
regarded, says Mr. Baker, as a betrayal of trust. And he more than
intimates that such a course would prove the highroad to
nullification by the United States Congress, or even to the
withdrawal of powers already in Filipino hands&mdash;either one of
which steps would be a serious blow to Filipino standing.</p>

<p class="sup"><sup>5</sup> See p. 93, ante.</p>

<p>Yet, using Secretary Baker&#39;s prohibition as their luminous
guide to contrary action, the party leaders swept on to a wholesale
attack upon the auditor&#39;s office. They did, to a T, the very
things the friendly Secretary feared they would do. And their
success is now nearly complete. To-day the Bureau of Audits
personnel consists of some four hundred officials and
employ&eacute;s, all of whom are Filipinos save one solitary
figure. The Insular Auditor himself&mdash;Mr. Benjamin F.
Wright&mdash;is an American. And the warfare upon the always
inconvenient Mr. Wright sleeps not, neither does it lack in
bitterness. Meantime the mere volume of business daily passing over
this one man&#39;s desk would make it a physical impossibility for
him to have knowledge of the workings of the Bureau commensurate
with his responsibility.</p>

<p>Therefore, beyond any question whatever, the Insular Auditor
should be given trained and competent American assistants, free
from political control, appointed by United States authority. Nor
should the additional expense implied, wherever levied, carry any
weight. Not only because the solvency of the present Insular
Government is involved, but also because the United States
Government stands morally responsible for some $110,000,000 of
Philippine Government and semi-government bonds floated in
America&mdash;bonds whose sinking funds are credibly alleged, by
the way, to contain a large amount of worthless securities.</p>

<h2>Chapter XII &mdash; THE CONLEY CASE</h2>

<p>Governor-General Wood from the start has insisted on broad
daylight upon all his proceedings. From the start, he has held that
the one great need of the whole Filipino people is to acquire an
educated, character-building public opinion; to develop civic
courage in the minds of the mass as distinguished from the little
handful on top.</p>

<p>With this in view he has sought out and utilized every
opportunity to broadcast the explanation of his acts, to make known
conditions and their causes, to talk things over publicly and
generally to inform the people about their own affairs.</p>

<p>All that was materially to be accomplished could certainly have
been accomplished far more effectively, more completely, more
rapidly, by a direct exercise of executive power. But to make the
gain a permanent gain to the people, it must be not merely a
material gain, but a gain in character and capacity, in
understanding and in the power of the will.</p>

<p>Such, our present executive has maintained, is the argument for
the slow methods of democracy.</p>

<p>And, little by little,&mdash;exceedingly slowly because of the
lack of the printed word, because of the illiteracy of the people,
and above all because of their centuries of dumb submission to
their cacique exploiters,&mdash;slowly, slowly, the new idea is
beginning to work.</p>

<p>But the doctrine is not an Oriental doctrine. The method is not
a cacique method. By no means can it harmonize with the cacique
scheme.</p>

<p>&quot;We do not desire to adopt an American ideal,&quot; they
repeated. &quot;We desire to develop our own national genius, and
to do it in our own way. We are impassioned Filipino
patriots.&quot;</p>

<p>Meantime the one great hope that at first had sustained their
courage was fading fast.</p>

<p>They really had believed, and had desperately clung to the
belief, that the plague come upon them would soon pass away.</p>

<p>Why not? This Governor-General, unlike his predecessor, was a
poor man. His pay as Governor-General would barely meet his
expenses however quietly he might run his house. And they knew from
their own sources that more than one tempting offer invited him
elsewhere. Unlike his predecessor, again, he was a man of
prominence in world affairs, and had much to lose and nothing to
gain from the little dignity of governing their Islands. He had
been sent out, so they believed, to remove him from the sight and
thought of the American electorate. And he would remain only till
his own political flair indicated return to the political
field.</p>

<p>&quot;Six months,&quot; they had guessed, &quot;a year at most,
and we shall be rid of him.&quot;</p>

<p>But six months had passed&mdash;the year of their utmost
margin&mdash;and yet money and place, the two irresistibles, failed
to do their work. Still he sat tight&mdash;this discomfiting
presence &mdash;and showed no sign of quitting.</p>

<p>And he said such mannerless, heart-breaking things as:</p>

<p>&quot;The lid is down on the Treasury Box. Free and unsecured
circulation of public funds among political friends <i>is
finished.&quot;</i></p>

<p>&quot;Tyrant! Iron-fisted militarist! We are a proud people, and
he hurts our sensibilities,&quot; they complained&mdash;&quot;we
are idealistic. Our poets&#39; souls cannot endure rough American
manners.&quot;</p>

<p>And far away in Washington Representative Cooper of Wisconsin
wept over their sorrows, while somebody else read yards of
resolutions in the sacred name of the Spirit of &#39;76.</p>

<p>Moreover, aside from his interference with the purse-strings,
they saw the foreign oppressor more and more going out into the
provinces&mdash;out among the taos, whom no politico ever visits
except to crack the whip&mdash;out among the masses of the people
in their remotest places. They observed that each time he returned
he brought some fresh annoyance, saying to the Director of the
Bureau of Lands:</p>

<p>&quot;Here. See what I have found.&quot;</p>

<p>Or to the Secretary of Justice:</p>

<p>&quot;Wake up! Get busy!&quot;</p>

<p>And they saw that, with it all, and despite every obstacle they
could put in his path, he was gradually reaching out for the
reins&mdash;gradually resuming for the United States Government
more and more of its self-elected duty to see that the Philippine
Government was run, not for the benefit of a small oligarchy, but
for the benefit of the whole people.</p>

<p>In brief, he was gaining too much ground, this present-day
American Governor-General. And the time had come when they, the
cacique leaders, must act. They must either turn to, follow the
American&#39;s lead and work on the job with him, or else they must
fight. And, to aid their realization of this fact, spurring words
had come from America, whence their agents warned them that peace
with the Governor-General was poor strategy, and that war must be
openly proclaimed and shouted across the ocean if they wished to
retain for themselves an American backing.</p>

<p>Thus Mr. Charles Edward Russell, in Washington, wrote Mr.
Teodoro M. Kalaw, Executive Secretary of the Independence
Commission in Manila, pointing out the dangers of quiet
acquiescence.</p>

<p>&quot;...It is the worst possible tactics,&quot; he said.
<i>&quot;.</i> .. The inevitable conclusion is that Manila does not
care much for independence. The belief that independence is not
really desired in the Philippines is by far the greatest obstacle
we have to encounter...If independence is to be won it will have to
be soon...The [American] people alone can give you independence. It
cannot be bestowed by presidents, Governors-General or even by
Congress. The people alone will decide...A few years from now they
will wake up...and then you can whistle for
independence.<sup>1</sup></p>

<p class="sup"><sup>1</sup> Published in the <i>Philippines
Herald,</i> February 5, 1923.</p>

<p>With such nervous warnings in their ears, with the Government
businesses threatened, with the tap shut off in the bank, with the
malady spreading to the provinces, and with the author of all these
curses apparently a fixture in his seat&mdash;obviously the Big
Caciques could sit no longer inactive. They must mount the red
flag.</p>

<p>This decision made, all that was needed was a catchword&mdash;a
Crisis. But a reasonable Crisis, to a Caucasian point of view,
might have seemed at the moment somewhat hard to dig up.</p>

<p>The thing was done, however, and done with some cleverness. This
is the story:&mdash;</p>

<p>Ray Conley, American, was an ex-soldier of the U. S. Army,
&quot;honourably discharged, character excellent.&quot; For many
years, since the Spanish War, he had served on the Manila police
force as chief of the vice squad. And he had developed a capacity
amounting almost to genius in the pursuit of gamblers and dealers
in opium.</p>

<p>Now, the Filipino is a gambler&mdash;a gambler down to his toes.
And opium smuggling is a profitable business. Certain gestures may
be made to save the face of the Law; but really to interfere in
either gambling or opium smuggling interests is a serious matter in
the Philippine Islands.</p>

<p>Conley, however, enjoyed his job. The double risks of it, and
the matching of his Western wits against the wits of the massed
Orientals, lured him. The life of his life was to catch some
prominent politico red-handed. And, when he was about to launch a
particularly difficult or spectacular raid, he was very likely to
send a hint to the American newspaper men. Whereby, whatever the
authorities might do and did do in hushing the matter up, certain
unhushable witnesses to the facts were likely to remain
available.</p>

<p>So Ray Conley, American, chief of the vice squad, became a
well-known, much feared and much hated man. And, during many years,
those whom his labours annoyed tried in concert to win free of
him.</p>

<p>Then came a day, in the autumn of 1921, when Conley, in raiding
a notorious Manila gambling house, found among his prisoners four
Filipino ladies, wives of truly prominent citizens. The four gave
fictitious names, and were immediately released from arrest by
special order of the Acting Chief of Police, a Filipino. But their
identity is a matter of knowledge.</p>

<p>From that moment attacks upon Conley in the native press became
open and virulent. He was making gambling unprofitable. And so
before long the man himself was arrested&mdash;on charge of taking
bribes from a Chinaman.</p>

<p>The case against Conley was childishly invented. The Mayor of
Manila&mdash;none other by the way than Director Ram&oacute;n J.
Fernandez of the National Bank&mdash;and the Secretary of the
Interior, Filipinos both, appeared in court as chief witnesses
against the accused. But their evidence on the stand was
embarrassingly flimsy. And the other chief witnesses were members
of the criminal class who had, themselves, been convicted of crimes
and misdemeanours principally through the activities of Officer
Conley.</p>

<p>The whole case, in fact, was so palpably a frame-up that the
judge, a Filipino, threw it out of court.</p>

<p>Meantime, at the personal requests of Mayor Fernandez and of the
Secretary of the Interior, Governor-General Wood had suspended
Conley from duty. Now, on his acquittal, he was, of course,
immediately reinstated. But hardly had he got to work when he was
again arrested on similar charges similarly sustained. And again,
on motion of the Prosecuting Attorney, a Filipino, the court threw
out the case.</p>

<p>In fact, there was no case.</p>

<p>Now, while every native paper in the Islands furiously called
for Conley&#39;s head, the Mayor of Manila and the Secretary of the
Interior once more appeared before Governor-General Wood demanding
opportunity to lay hold upon Conley directly.</p>

<p>&quot;No, Mr. Mayor. No, Mr. Secretary,&quot; said the
Governor-General. &quot;You have disqualified yourselves. You
can&#39;t sit in judgment on a man whom you yourselves have already
denounced in court as guilty. I will, however, order an
administrative investigation by an unprejudiced board, and if
Con-ley is convicted he shall be punished to the extent of the law.
But if he is cleared, he will be restored to duty.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Of course,&quot; said Mayor Fernandez. &quot;Of
course,&quot; said the Secretary of the Interior, &quot;if the man
is exonerated, we shall, as your Excellency says, promptly restore
him to duty.&quot;</p>

<p>The Governor-General accordingly appointed an investigating
board, consisting of the Director of Civil Service and the
Under-Secretary of Justice, Filipinos both, plus an American
Colonel of Constabulary. This board, after careful examination,
also exonerated Conley and recommended his reinstatement.</p>

<p>But Mayor Fernandez and the Secretary of the Interior made no
move to keep their pledge.</p>

<p>Then the Chief of Police rose up. &quot;My man is being
persecuted,&quot; he protested. &quot;How can I run a police
department if such things happen!&quot; And he went to the
Governor-General for relief.</p>

<p>On July 12th, the Governor-General, as a reminder of a pledge
unfulfilled, sent to the Secretary of the Interior a copy of the
Investigating Board&#39;s recommendation for Conley&#39;s
restoration to duty. On July 13th, the Secretary of Interior
endorsed the papers to the Mayor for action, resigned his office
and left town.</p>

<p>Receiving the document, the Mayor of Manila also resigned his
office and also left town&mdash;without, however, reinstating
Officer Conley.</p>

<p>As a result of these two self-erasures, no official remained
between the Governor-General and the Chief of Police. On July 14th,
therefore, upon order of the Governor-General, the Chief of Police
reinstated his man.</p>

<p>Two days later Conley resigned and the Governor-General accepted
his resignation.</p>

<p>But on July 15th, the day after Conley&#39;s reinstatement, the
Filipino members of the Council of State&mdash;being the President
of the Senate, Mr. Quezon; the Speaker of the House, Mr. Roxas, and
the Departmental Heads&mdash;served His Excellency, the
Governor-General, with an ultimatum:</p>

<p>If he accepted the resignations of the Secretary of the Interior
and the Mayor of Manila, so they declared, they, the Council of
State would all resign&mdash;every single one.</p>

<p>&quot;Say to these gentlemen,&quot; replied His Excellency in
effect, &quot;that I should be very glad to have the Secretary of
the Interior and Mayor Fernandez reconsider their stand, and will
give them to that end twenty-four hours.&quot;</p>

<p>Indeed, he went farther than that. Tempering the wind to their
sensitive self-esteem, he offered to permit the Mayor and the
Secretary of the Interior to withdraw their resignations bare of
comment, statement or apology. Calling in the members of the
Council of State, without heat and with enduring patience he
reasoned and explained to them, still deferring the hour of action.
For in action itself he could have no choice. To permit them their
point&mdash;to agree that an American Executive must never
intervene in Departmental matters&mdash;would be to permit one more
move in the game of jockeying America into a position of
responsibility without authority.</p>

<p>But the Big Caciques had need of an impossible situation. For
they had need of war. Therefore they stood firm on grounds that
Judge Sumulong, &quot;the brain of the opposition,&quot; did not
hesitate to describe as &quot;fictitious, artificial, ridiculous
and frivolous.&quot; And late at night on the 17th of
July&mdash;one day after Conley&#39;s resignation had been
accepted&mdash;back they all filed into Malaca&ntilde;an to present
their joint resignation.</p>

<p>The &quot;crisis&quot; had come at last.</p>

<p>&quot;Your plans have been deliberately made,&quot; said His
Excellency, &quot;and your action is in the character of a
challenge and a threat which I cannot ignore. I regret exceedingly
this occurrence...It means an abandonment of your posts and
obligations at a time of great responsibility, on alleged issues
unsupported by evidence and unworthy the attention of
serious-minded men.</p>

<p>&quot;I accept your resignations.&quot;</p>

<p>So then they all bowed themselves out and there was an end of
it.</p>

<p>But next day the ex-secretaries began individually to lament.
&quot;We didn&#39;t want to resign,&quot; they assured their
private friends who passed it on. &quot;We never expected it to
happen. Quezon told us again and again that there was no
risk&mdash;that General Wood never would dare to accept our
resignations&mdash;that he couldn&#39;t govern without us. We had
12,000 pesos a year and an automobile apiece&mdash;and good jobs.
We have been getting on splendidly. The Governor-General never
disapproved any of our acts or recommendations. He never even
inspected our offices in person. He just showed us the general
policy of what to do, and left us to study out our own way of doing
it. What he asked was results. We were learning a great deal. He
never sent a bill to the Legislature concerning any of our
departments without working it well out first with the secretary
concerned. We didn&#39;t want to resign, but Quezon was set on it
for his own sake. He forced us to resign. He and Roxas didn&#39;t
sacrifice one cent by their move. They only resigned as members of
the Council of State, which office carries no remuneration, not as
President of the Senate and Speaker of the House. We Secretaries
are the ones that had to bite off our own noses to please him. But
Quezon always thinks only of his own ambitions. And we have got to
live here under him, maybe. If we rebelled and America went away,
we should be doomed men.&quot;</p>

<p>All of the foregoing paragraph will be categorically denied by
the ex-officials concerned, unless in most confidential statement.
From their standpoint, they say, they must deny it. Privately they
admit it. Allowing for variance of words, not of sense, it is true
of every single one of them.</p>

<p>And their dismay was none the less genuine when their
disappearance made no hole except in their own fortunes. For the
under-secretaries immediately stepped in as departmental heads and
departmental work continued as smoothly as before. The Council of
State remained unchanged, except in individual personnel and in the
disappearance from the table of Messrs. Quezon and Roxas. Now a
Council of Secretaries, it functions exactly as did the old Council
of State, whose duties it has duly performed without
interruption.</p>

<p>The Governor-General&#39;s entire action in the affair was taken
with the full knowledge and adhesion of the Director of Civil
Service&mdash;a Filipino.</p>

<p>The story above narrated gives the precise facts in the Con-ley
case. In them the tale the pol&iacute;ticos tell is not to be
recognized.</p>

<p>And the matter is here detailed at length so great simply
because it has been characterized in America, where it was never
understood, as &quot;a trifling incident concerning an obscure city
detective in which General Wood officiously meddled.&quot;</p>

<p>On this it is fair to comment that no attempt to terrorize a
police officer from the pursuit of duty will ever be rated as
&quot;trifling&quot; by an honest Executive; and that no man&#39;s
obscurity can diminish his claim to justice and to the protection
of the law.</p>

<p>But, beyond the question of right and justice, another feature
in the &quot;Conley Case&quot; forbade America&#39;s representative
to pass it lightly by:</p>

<p>The Jones Bill, in Section 21, provides:</p>

<blockquote>That the supreme executive power shall be vested
in...the Governor-General of the Philippine Islands...[who] shall
have general supervision and control of all the departments and
bureaus of the Government...</blockquote>

<p>Mr. Harrison acquiescing, the Philippine Legislature had later
enacted measures directly defying the United States law just
quoted. To these Mr. Quezon frankly pointed as &quot;legislation
meant by the Wood-Forbes Commission &#39;diminishing, limiting or
dividing the authority granted the Governor-General&#39; under the
Jones Law, and which said Mission wanted to have Congress declare
null and void.&quot;</p>

<p>But, Mr. Quezon continued, &quot;that legislation was duly
reported to the Congress of the United States, which failed or
refused to exercise its power and authority to annul the same. It
is, therefore, in our statute books with the implied sanction of
Congress.&quot; <sup>2</sup></p>

<p class="sup"><sup>2</sup> <i>The National Forum,</i> Manila,
November, 1923, p. 64.</p>

<p>And Senator Sergio Osme&ntilde;a drew an undeniably logical
conclusion when he wrote.<sup>3</sup></p>

<p class="sup"><sup>3</sup><i>Ibid.,</i> October, 1923, p. 56.</p>

<p>&quot;Although President Harding [by his inaction thereon]
disapproved the recommendation of the Wood-Forbes Mission in regard
to the Jones Law, yet he appointed General Wood to be
governor-general&quot;...pointing out the confusion that must arise
from the assumed opposition of ideas between the President and his
Administrator.</p>

<p>Launched from the ground just indicated, the Big Caciques now
attacked, swinging their &quot;Conley Case&quot; as a weapon. It
was &quot;the culmination of a series of abuses&quot; they
declared. No American Governor-General had the right to review any
action of any Filipino Department Secretary. Governor-General Wood
had exceeded his authority&mdash;in fact, had no authority in any
Department. The word of the Secretaries must be final, Jones Bill
to the contrary notwithstanding. These things they laid flat down
as charges preferred.</p>

<p>The policy of the Big Caciques was now reduced to one premise
and one conclusion:</p>

<p>Governor-General Wood blocked the way of their personal
ambitions, since they could make no farther inroads upon American
sovereignty, no farther inroads upon public funds and resources,
while he remained in office.</p>

<p>Therefore, Governor-General Wood must go.</p>

<p>And, to that end, from that hour, every act and every energy of
the Big Caciques has been bent.</p>

<p><i>&quot;Wood must go!&quot;</i> says Mr. Quezon&mdash;and has
said it so hard and so often that his own words have become his
master.</p>

<p>&quot;It is knife to the hilt with him,&quot; comment his quiet
compatriots from the side-line. &quot;He has staked his all on this
and cannot go back. He made the last Governor-General and ruled
him. Now if he can unmake this one, his name will be great among
us.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Whereas, if he can&#39;t&mdash;he is finished.&quot;</p>

<hr>

<h2>Chapter XIII &mdash; THE LITTLE YACHT &quot;APO&quot;</h2>

<p>So now the war was on&mdash;war on two fronts&mdash;the
Philippines and America.</p>

<p>And it was a device called the Independence Fund that made both
campaigns the more picturesque.</p>

<p>The Act creating the Independence Fund was one of the later
fruits of Mr. Harrison&#39;s rule, drafted in view of the
possibility that his successors in office might prove less shy of
the veto than was he. This Act appropriated five hundred thousand
dollars of public money &quot;to defray the expenses of the
Independence Commission including publicity and all other expenses
in connection with the performance of its duties.&quot; And it
provided that this credit continue automatically from year to year,
&quot;although the appropriation acts hereafter approved may not
make any specific appropriation for said purpose.&quot;</p>

<p>In enjoyment of means so elastic, successive parties of
pol&iacute;ticos made excursions to Washington as special advocates
of the independence of the Islands. They entertained a good deal.
They were interested in a Philippine Press Bureau, which, under
guidance of a well-paid American ex-Congressman, gathered and sent
out to a free mailing list all sorts of attacks upon American
administration and authority, all sorts of tales not too
scrupulously exact as to events and opinions in the Islands. And
they, the Independence Commissioners, personally drew from the
Independence Fund such sums on account of salary, entertainment and
travelling expenses as would have made their stay-at-home brothers
sit up and stare had the figures been published in their
cognizance.</p>

<p>But their expenditures were jealously guarded from home
inquiry.</p>

<p>And so, naturally enough, Manila saw an annual stampede for
appointment to that commission. To be able to pocket, like
Commissioner Roxas, $112.50, gold, a day, clear; to be able to set
down $560, gold, for one dinner&mdash;and not be asked for the
names of one&#39;s guests; to be able to turn in any expense
figures, sure of reimbursement without parley&mdash;are such things
to be scoffed at?</p>

<p>Men did not scoff. They scrambled.</p>

<p>The Independence Commissioner to Washington, you see, drew very
considerably more than twice the pay of the Governor-General of the
Islands.</p>

<p>Also, in Washington they had all the fun of delivering a rear
attack upon the Governor-General&#39;s reputation; in which
movement they were supported, in Congress and out, by American
politicians of available quality.</p>

<p>Every bit of venom afloat, every scrap of rumour or gossip, from
whatever obscure corner, every snarl of party backbiters, their
American ex-congressman&#39;s &quot;bulletin&quot; set forth in
striking dress, ready to be clipped and inserted in American
country papers looking for copy. And then, from the Gluetown
<i>Goblet</i> or the Smith City <i>Smudge</i> these were gleaned
again, redressed, and sent back to Manila as indices of American
public opinion.</p>

<p>And ever out of the fund, trickling easily, came any sort of
persuader, any sort of inducement, that any delicate matters might
need, to further accomplishment in any delicate direction on either
side of the Pacific Ocean. The terms of the Appropriating Act were,
as has been said, most discreet. You could invite anybody &quot;to
dinner.&quot;</p>

<p>Meantime, some of the Americans in the Islands began to discuss
the matter somewhat as follows:</p>

<p>&quot;Where does this &#39;Independence Fund&#39; come
from?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Appropriation from the revenues of the Insular
Government.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Where do the revenues of the Insular Government come
from?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Taxes on business for the most part.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Who pays these taxes?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In view of the way in which Insular Government accounts
are kept since Filipinization, it is almost impossible to get real
figures on any subject. But no one disputes that, at the lowest
estimate, between 70 and 80 per cent of the taxes are paid by
&#39;Americans and other foreigners; or that at least 90 per cent
of all retail and semi-retail trade is done by the
Chinese.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do these &#39;Americans and other foreigners&#39; here
doing business want to see these Islands push off from America and
set up an Independent Government?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They say not. They want peace.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, anyway, it is illegal and seditious to lay hands on
public funds, built up from everybody&#39;s taxes, and to use them
as a weapon against existing government. Or, if it isn&#39;t
illegal then something&#39;s wrong with the law.&quot;</p>

<p>The pol&iacute;ticos&#39; campaign in the Islands took the form
of blockading tactics in the Legislature, and of destructive
attempts upon American prestige everywhere. Of constructive
legislation, as involving major policies of government, little if
any lies to the credit of the Legislatures following the
&quot;crisis.&quot; On the other hand, more than a few measures
were introduced simply for the purpose of drawing a veto, in order
to accumulate grounds for pointing to the Governor-General&#39;s
&quot;autocratic&quot; methods.</p>

<p>To describe these in detail would be burdensome. To choose among
them is difficult. So one may as well start anywhere.</p>

<p>Take, then, the appropriation bill of 1923, as an example.</p>

<p>With curious frankness, the pol&iacute;ticos spoke of their
intent to pass that bill in exact accord with the
Governor-General&#39;s budget, excepting one thing:&mdash;They
would curtail the support of his own office. Among other impossible
losses, he would be deprived of his cable clerk and of the use of
the Executive yacht, the <i>Apo.</i></p>

<p>Thus he would be forced into the awkward necessity of approving
the body of the bill, while vetoing that which struck at him
personally.</p>

<p>Meantime, they carried on, in the press, the necessary
accompaniment of talk about &quot;Wood&#39;s Fishing Parties,&quot;
and the reckless squandering of taxpayers&#39; money upon luxury
afloat, until the <i>Apo</i> seemed a sort of golden barge on which
a tyrant sybarite was wont to flee the duties of his place.</p>

<p>Now the responsible Executive of an archipelago numbering
twenty-seven hundred inhabited islands, scattered over a sea area
above a thousand by six hundred and fifty miles square has real
need of transportation at his personal command&mdash;has real need
of some craft not already committed to schedule service.</p>

<p>Such a craft is the modest little <i>Apo.</i> Fitted up with an
office into which the desk-work of the day is bodily transferred,
the <i>Apo</i> often puts to sea on a half-hour&#39;s notice. And
the Governor-General, at his desk in his cabin, pursuing his tasks
with scarcely a break, will have put a mass of finished work behind
him before the first anchorage. Rarely or never does he go on such
trips without taking Filipino officials as guests. And it is
precisely in this manner that some of them have first learned the
geography of their own islands, or have first seen any soil other
than that of their own particular island of Luzon.</p>

<p>It was in the period of &quot;the Crisis,&quot; however, that
the Big Caciques themselves began to voyage about a bit among the
Islands, showing themselves, talking anti-America, and explaining
to the rural masses that if once they could be rid of the foreign
heel upon their necks, they would never have to work any more, but
would all bask tax-free, rich and happy. &quot;That,&quot; they
said, &quot;is the meaning of Independence! Who is for
Independence?&quot;</p>

<p>Everybody.</p>

<p>&quot;Get rid of America!&quot; they declaimed. &quot;Get rid of
Wood! Our Philippines for the Filipinos! Follow <i>us,</i> your
leaders.&quot;</p>

<p>And then, as a sort of rainbow pledge of joys to come&mdash;a
sort of celebration of their visit&mdash;declared on their own
authority that the Philippine Legislature would remit the penalty
on unpaid land taxes, would vote a largess for immediate
distribution; would vote a Calamity Fund, let it be called, since,
even by the feeblest imagination, suitable calamities can always be
discovered.</p>

<p>So therefore, &quot;An Act to Appropriate the Sum of $50,000 for
the Relief of Indigent Sufferers from Public Calamities&quot;
<i><sup>l</sup></i> was introduced in the Assembly, while the
Senate brought forth &quot;An Act Remitting the Penalty of the Land
Tax in the Philippine Islands for the Year 1923.&quot;
<sup>2</sup></p>

<p class="sup"><sup>1</sup> House Bill, No. 875.</p>

<p class="sup"><sup>2</sup> Senate Bill, No. 216.</p>

<p>Meantime, speakers in both houses, together with the politico
press, played proper instrumental accompaniments on the theme of
catastrophic typhoons and other alleged visitations of Providence
that had &quot;prostrated the people,&quot; leaving no recourse
from starvation save to a parental Government&#39;s purse.</p>

<p>And it was exactly illustrative of the annoying habits of the
<i>Apo</i> that, late one night, the little white yacht slid out
from her place in Manila Bay, carrying the Governor-General on an
unheralded trip to inspect the &quot;calamitous&quot;
provinces.</p>

<p>For the Jones Law&mdash;in this instance again mocked by the
pol&iacute;ticos&mdash;rules concerning America&#39;s
representative in the Islands, that</p>

<blockquote>he is hereby vested with the exclusive power...to remit
fines and forfeitures and may veto any legislation
enacted...<sup>3</sup></blockquote>

<p class="sup"><sup>3</sup> <i>Jones Bill,</i> section 21.</p>

<p>Again and again has the present Governor-General exerted that
power, extending time of payment without penalty wherever
conditions have warranted it. But, to be by law the
&quot;exclusive&quot; authority, implies a duty to know conditions
before acting.</p>

<p>The conditions of the provinces, as the <i>Apo</i> visited them,
left no room for doubt. Typhoons? Yes, there had been typhoons.
Each year brings typhoons. Typhoons are what weather is made of.
But not a sign could be found of special necessity.</p>

<p>The sole new feature, anywhere, was taos bowed in sorrow over
the fact that they had paid their 1923 taxes. They had done it, of
course, because otherwise they would be dispossessed of their lands
by the local caciques. But now, it seemed, no one who had not
already paid need bother his head about penalties for non-payment.
Why had they paid, then, since the money wasn&#39;t needed! Was it
a mistake?</p>

<p>The whole thing, in brief, was a farce&mdash;the kind of farce
that the Islands are full of. The &quot;calamities,&quot; such as
they were, had occurred only in the course of nature and within a
very small area. And yet they were to serve as excuse for
postponing payment of the land taxes of the entire archipelago.</p>

<p>As if, a late frost having damaged the gooseberry crop in
Genesee County, all tax penalties should, therefore, be remitted in
the State of New York.</p>

<p>Again, over all the archipelago, in whatever direction, such
taxes as remained unpaid were the taxes, not of the poor people,
but of the caciques.</p>

<p>&quot;For Heaven&#39;s sake, <i>don&#39;t</i> remit!&quot; said
one provincial governor. &quot;They&#39;ve all paid here but the
rich men. It&#39;s hard enough to get our people to pay taxes, at
best. Don&#39;t go spoil what little habit is forming!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The only delinquent taxpayers here,&quot; said the
treasurer of another province, &quot;are the chief
pol&iacute;ticos&mdash;the large land owners.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;America is a joke,&quot; this thing told the country.
&quot;We, the Big Caciques, tie her laws into bow-knots and make
and break her Governor-Generals as suits us. The <i>purse-strings
are ours,</i> please observe. Pick your winners.&quot;</p>

<p>The bill remitting penalties for non-payments of the land tax,
as passed by the Philippine Legislature and presented for Executive
signature, carried no reason, set forth no justifying cause.
Unashamed and brief, it baldly said, &quot;remit.&quot;</p>

<p>The Governor-General vetoed it; vetoed the Calamity bill as
well.</p>

<p>And then, first doubling the amount of the Calamity fund, the
Legislature passed both bills over his veto.</p>

<p>Again, the Jones Law rules that any act of the Philippine
Legislature re-passed over a Governor-General&#39;s veto shall go
to the President of the United States, who may either annul or
approve it; and that if the President, for six months thereafter,
does nothing, the act automatically becomes law, &quot;the same as
if it had been specially approved.&quot;</p>

<p>Meanwhile the little yacht <i>Apo,</i> in spite of the budget
that cut off her provender, kept moving. For the Jones Law,
provides that:</p>

<p>&quot;The Governor-General shall have the power to veto any
particular item or items of an appropriation bill, but the veto
shall not effect the item or items to which he does not
object.&quot; And further provides that, when, at the end of a
fiscal year, an appropriation necessary for Government support for
the year to come has not been made, the sum named for that purpose
in the preceding appropriation bill shall be deemed
re-appropriated.</p>

<p>These two provisions saved the <i>Apo</i> to the people&#39;s
use, and, incidentally, produced many a curious picture. For
example:</p>

<p>It was one day late in March, 1924, that the <i>Apo</i> slid up
the little-known coast of Palawan Island and dropped anchor at
Puerto Princesa, the capital of the province, a place of less than
6,000 inhabitants.</p>

<p>Now it is Governor-General Wood&#39;s custom, on such inspection
trips, to open proceedings by a rapid survey of the presidencia,
the schools, the hospital, if any, and the jail, these points
presenting some index of local conditions. And it was in the
presidencia of Puerto Princesa that he came, this March morning,
upon something that excited his interest. Looking over the
mortality records he saw that &quot;a pagan&quot; had recently been
killed, in Puerto Princesa itself, by a fall from a tree.</p>

<p>&quot;What,&quot; His Excellency desired to know, &quot;was a
pagan&mdash;a wild, shy, inland man&mdash;doing up a tree in this
coast-town of Puerto Princesa? And, granted the pagan up the tree,
how did that pagan&mdash;a creature as much at home in trees as a
monkey&mdash;how did that pagan manage to fall? And fall so hard as
to kill himself? Kindly explain.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh&quot;&mdash;ran the explanation&mdash;&quot;the tree
was a cocoanut tree. The pagan was sent up to gather cocoanuts. He
fell, and so hard, because he had chains on his legs.&quot;</p>

<p><i>&quot;Chains on his legs!</i> Why?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Because he was a prisoner.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So you send men in irons up trees to work? Why was he
imprisoned?&quot;</p>

<p>Then came forth the tale&mdash;a headless, footless tale&mdash;a
typical tale of some sort of loss or accusation of loss&mdash;some
violence of which no one had any clear idea either as to aggression
or as to aggressors, in connection with which forty pagans had been
dragged down out of the hinterland and imprisoned in Puerto
Princesa jail.</p>

<p>A provincial jail, by the way, is a good place to park cheap
labour.</p>

<p>The Governor-General proceeded to the jail and to business. Nor
did he stop till the thirty-nine pagans stood before him. All wore
heavy chains. All were as helplessly ignorant of the cause and
meaning of their fate as so many paroquets. And all had been
prisoners, in chains, &quot;awaiting trial&quot; since the
sixteenth of the preceding November. Court would not sit until the
middle of the following April.</p>

<p>Certain radical changes, as may easily be believed, started on
the spot. Certain simple elucidations of points of decency, law,
and human rights, all news to Puerto Princesa. Also, a criminal
investigation was ordered, to determine just who, in terms of brass
tacks, was responsible for condemning a shackled prisoner to death
by a fall from a cocoanut tree.</p>

<p>Beyond reasonable doubt things are this moment afoot in Palawan,
in Puerto Princesa, as in hundreds of towns in the islands, every
whit the equal of the tale just told. Its main significance, after
all, is as a symptom. But if that day&#39;s brusque awakening made
succeeding slumber one hair&#39;s breadth less profound, much was
accomplished.</p>

<p>In another provincial capital the Governor-General, unexpectedly
appearing one day in the midst of a torrential rain, betook himself
straight to the hospital. As he was about to enter the building, he
noticed a little heap of something that moaned, lying in a pool of
water in the open yard. A ragged blanket covered it over. The
General, stooping, lifted the blanket and looked beneath.</p>

<p>Straightening again, with an unmoved face, he said to the dapper
little hospital chief then scurrying forward to greet him.</p>

<p>&quot;Doctor, why is this poor old woman lying here in the
wet?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Because, Your Excellency,&quot; the Filipino explained,
not too happily, &quot;she has an unpleasant disease, so that it is
not agreeable to have her in the wards, and we have no other place
to put her.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But you have a single room for women here,&quot; rejoined
the visitor. &quot;Why did you not use that?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah&mdash;to be sure, yes. Your Excellency&#39;s memory is
remarkable indeed! But that room is not in order at present. It is
quite unusable&mdash;unsanitary&mdash;out of repair.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I think it must be better than bare ground, in the wind
and the rain, any way. Let&#39;s go have a look.&quot; And without
waiting to be led, off strode the General, into the hospital
building, and straight away to the door of that single room that he
remembered from his last visit, a year before.</p>

<p>Inside, amidst conditions of special ease, a sleek young mestizo
cacique sprawled upon a comfortable bed, while a friend sat by his
side, rolling cigarettes. The youth on the bed was a provincial
official supposed to be in jail awaiting trial for mishandling
public funds.</p>

<br>
IGOROT ON THE TRAIL<br>
M. M. Newell</p>

<p>It was again as an incident of an inspection voyage among the
Islands that Governor-General Wood, giving no intimation of his
intention, no chance for preparations to be made, walked in upon a
roomful of lepers, male and female, herded together for future
disposition. The room was small, and packed full. And the condition
of its occupants told its own awful tale. For a moment General Wood
stood in the doorway in silent pity looking at them, while they,
uncomprehending, stared dully back. Then, with a shriek, a young
girl, pushing forward from among the mass, threw herself at his
feet, pouring out a stream of Spanish, imploring,
sobbing&mdash;then springing erect to stand with arms cast
wide.</p>

<p>&quot;Look, sir,&quot; she cried, &quot;I am no leper. In the
name of our merciful God, Who sent you, <i>look!&quot;</i></p>

<p>The child in very truth was clean and whole&mdash;a pretty,
delicate creature. Yet for weeks she had been shut up in closest
contact with these huddled victims of the Terror of the Ages,
awaiting permanent consignment to their fate.</p>

<p>Her father, you see, had dared to oppose the head politico of
the town. This was the revenge of the cacique. It will help to an
understanding of the fact that under a Filipinized Government few
men dare give their names to any protest against things as they
are.</p>

<p>But it is precisely surprises like these&mdash;inconvenient,
unconventional, widely spread, very often repeated&mdash;that have
given General Wood the reputation of &quot;militaristic
imperialism.&quot; Not long ago the provincial officials in a
certain place through which he was passing gave a banquet in the
second story of the presidencia. It was a fine banquet, with much
food and many speeches, mostly about Immediate Independence,
Abraham Lincoln, and Philippines for the Filipinos. At the end the
Governor-General gave another exhibition of &quot;lack of
tact.&quot;</p>

<p>As the party descended the stairway, he stopped and said:
&quot;Gentlemen, I do not know how many of you know what is beneath
this stair, but I looked in, on my arrival, and now I should like
you to do the same. It is part of the more immediate business of
your province.&quot;</p>

<p>Underneath that stair, in a small stone cell, chained each to
the floor, were a middle-aged woman and a young man. Both were
naked, or nearly so. The one was melancholy-mad, the other
merry-frantic. The floor lay deep in human excrement.</p>

<p>Such, a few years ago, was the general condition of the insane
in the Philippines. Such it widely remained, when Governor-General
Wood took office. In the very capital city itself, in the hospital
of San L&aacute;zaro, conditions were very closely comparable to
those in that same cell beneath the presidencia stairs.</p>

<p>A disgrace to twenty-one years of American government?</p>

<p>Ah&mdash;but remember that the first five American Governors had
all the customs, all the inertia of the age-long past with which to
battle in every field. Remember, too, that the sixth American
Governor put his seven years of opportunity into undoing his
predecessors&#39; accomplishments. And it is slower work dragging
things up hill than pushing them down.</p>

<hr>
<a name="ch-14" id="ch-14"></a>
<h2>Chapter XIV &mdash; &quot;UNCLEAN! UNCLEAN!&quot;</h2>

<p>The Filipinos are probably more seriously afflicted with leprosy
than are any other people in the world. Official records show
approximately one leper to every 2,000 of the population. Given
such a basis of proportion, we in America would have half a million
lepers. Whereas, for all our accessions from beyond seas, we have
fewer than one thousand victims of this horror of all time.</p>

<p>Before America came to the Islands, no systematic plan existed
there for attempting eradication of the disease. Under the auspices
of the Roman Catholic Church, a number of leper hospitals had been
started, notably in Manila and in Ceb&uacute;, but these at best
could only feed the hungry, as a charity, and rather spread the
malady than controlled it.</p>

<p>So the great bulk of the sick&mdash;some ten thousand in
number&mdash;went at large all over the Islands.</p>

<p>Some lay hidden in the houses of their relatives. Some roamed
the village streets, wailing their woes and mingling with the
common life at the wells, in the food-markets, in the fiesta
crowds. Some, stoned by the people and driven out from their
barrios, gathered in ghastly companies on barren sandbars in the
sea. Some haunted forests on the skirts of habitations, fed, if
they were fed at all, by uncertain doles of rice and rotten fish
left within their reach by givers who fled with averted face once
they had set their burdens down.</p>

<p>This was as America found it. And our first or military
Government, recognizing the necessity of attacking the job,
selected the Island of Culion as the site of a future leper colony.
But the Augean Stables were not cleaned with one sweep of the
shovel, and some years passed before this particular task met its
turn.</p>

<p>To-day Culion is the largest leper colony in the world. And to
one man&mdash;Dr. Victor G. Heiser&mdash;belongs the full credit of
its upbuilding.</p>

<p>As Commissioner of Public Health for the Philippines, Dr. Heiser
appointed himself to this appalling task. Himself he executed
it&mdash;and as long as it remained in his control it challenged
the world&#39;s admiration.</p>

<p>As a first step, he bought out the property rights of such
residents as were found on Culion, removing the people to the
neighbouring island of Busuanga. Then he laid out and built a
fine-looking modern town, suitable to the comfort of a people who
must live long lives and die slow deaths within its boundaries. He
installed a sanitary sewage scheme, a proper water supply, a
lighting system, built a commodious hospital, churches, a community
centre, plazas, a post office, and even made a currency peculiar to
the colony, not to circulate elsewhere.</p>

<p>Then, when the place neared readiness, he photographed its many
pleasant aspects, showing what it was&mdash;a light in the darkness
of native town-building&mdash;and sent doctors abroad in the land
to lecture to the people, with the pictures to prove their words.
This was in 1906-7.</p>

<p>At that time no one knew how many lepers the Islands contained,
but only that the curse, open or secret, was interwoven throughout
the body social, with filaments everywhere.</p>

<p>So the doctors travelled and talked, showing their assuring
pictures and explaining to the people the terrible dangers to
themselves of living with the sick, the advantage to the
communities of isolating the sufferers, the advantage to the
sufferers themselves of living in such conditions as Culion
offered. And then, when interest had to some degree been
aroused&mdash;when some promise of co-operation had been obtained
from local authorities, and when the devoted French nuns who
immediately volunteered for service were installed&mdash;Dr. Reiser
sent out a boat to collect his patients.</p>

<p>But on the first trip, the seamen in a body&mdash;Americans and
Filipinos alike&mdash;deserted ship. The sights they met were too
grim, the dangers they ran too great. Used though they were to
seeing the thing in their daily lives, this concentration of horror
passed their strength. In a bunch they quit, and not one man of
them could be coaxed or bribed to return to his berth.</p>

<p>&quot;All right, I&#39;ll go myself,&quot; said Dr. Heiser,
&quot;but I can&#39;t run the boat single-handed. Who&#39;s got the
grit to help?&quot;</p>

<p>Then up spoke Captain Hillgrove, Maine Yankee, good old
sailorman. &quot;Doc, I&#39;ll see you through,&quot; said he.</p>

<p>&quot;Me too,&quot; said Sawyer, Hillgrove&#39;s American
engineer.</p>

<p>So three good men with their teeth set worked the job&mdash;till
a few gained courage to follow them.</p>

<p>From port to port they steamed, the leader persuading,
explaining, gradually filling the little craft with the boldest or
the most rebellious against a fearful fate.</p>

<p>To quote Dr. Reiser&#39;s own words, as he wrote five years
later:<i><sup>1</sup></i></p>

<blockquote>By 1908 at least one collection of lepers had been made
all over the archipelago, and in many provinces a number of
collections had been made; but there were necessarily quite a
number [of the sick] who escaped the early collections and went
into hiding, and also a considerable number who were in the
incubation period of the disease, from infection which they had
probably received through their association with cases of leprosy.
So that cases still come to notice, and these, as soon as
discovered, are isolated, and, at frequent intervals each year, are
transferred to Culion...It is roughly estimated that there were
formerly at least 1200 new cases of leprosy contracted each year,
and it is believed that now, with the lessened opportunities of
infection,... at least 600 persons are being saved annually from
contracting this most loathsome disease; that this number remain as
useful members of society instead of being a burden upon the public
during the remainder of their existence.</blockquote>

<p class="sup"><sup>1</sup> Dr. Victor G. Heiser, &quot;Sanitation
in the Philippines,&quot; <i>Journal of Race Development,</i> Vol.
Ill, No. <i>2,</i> October, 1912.</p>

<p>Dr. Heiser omitted to say, however, that he himself made all
these collecting trips, in person gathering his patients. He was
giving a life term, you see, to every man, woman and child whom he
took, and the possibilities of trouble in the wrenching apart of
families and friends, the possibility of mistakes in diagnosis, and
the possibilities of attempts at false commitments through ill-will
were great.</p>

<p>So, quite simply, he shouldered the whole work.</p>

<p>And, in handling these pitiful people in the painstaking way he
did, he exposed himself to the sickness to an extent that might
easily have meant the ultimate sacrifice.</p>

<p>Or, were further testimony needed as to the spirit and manner of
Dr. Reiser&#39;s service, it would be found in the fact that never
in all his journeys of collecting did the people resist him. Not
once did he need to use force or to ask the Constabulary&#39;s
aid.</p>

<p>As to the life that he had devised for them in the town that he
had built for their occupation, the like of it had never been seen.
A corps of doctors and nurses was constantly on duty there, and the
study of the ailment as well as the care of the patients went
steadily forward. But aside from that, the people enjoyed a degree
of freedom and well-being unheard-of before.</p>

<p>For their friend made them self-ruling. He set over them no
guards of any kind. He gave them the government of their own town.
They elected their own officials, and they made, themselves, the
laws under which they lived. Thus while, on the one hand, Culion
relieved the whole people of the archipelago from the danger of
contact with the sick, on the other it gave to the leper a real
home. In Culion he was no longer an outcast, but a welcome and
competent citizen, busy about natural and productive pursuits or
congenial pleasures. He planted his garden, studied music, kept a
shop, taught school, made useful articles to sell to his
neighbours. He lived the life of a normal man.</p>

<p>Meantime, the abysmal ignorance of the general populace of the
Islands together with their childlike superstition, presented to
such salvage work the same resistance that such elements always
oppose to any upward change. It is as if some inexorable process of
evolution would refuse to be set aside by any act of the genius of
man.</p>

<p>And so, while Americans at home played bridge or golf or the
stockmarket, while Americans from yachts and liners visited the
spotless temples of Japan, or Hongkong&#39;s lovely avenues, or sat
in the Manila Hotel talking theory with Filipino ladies with
American college educations and butterfly sleeves, the actual life
of this our American dependency ran along beside it
all&mdash;beside, and yet two thousand years apart.</p>

<p>Countless tales&mdash;tales from each house, in each barrio,
each hour of each day, each year, might illustrate the fact. Take
one:</p>

<p>From a certain town great news came forth.</p>

<p>The Christ had appeared. In His Very Person had been seen, first
of few and then of many.</p>

<p>So that no man, woman or child in all those parts took thought
of any other thing, but all, in wide and wider circles, as word
passed from mouth to mouth, dropped their concerns, hastening to
the spot where the Blessed Presence might be witnessed.</p>

<p>The whole countryside was moving. Its whole people was stirred
to the depths.</p>

<p>To one man alone the miracle had first been revealed&mdash;a
hunter, afoot in the forest before the dawn. He, silent, crouching,
hidden in the undergrowth, the better to watch a
water-hole&mdash;for it was dry time, and the animals travelled far
to drink&mdash;he, the hunter, first saw the Vision of the
Lord.</p>

<p>It came in that grey dimness that foreruns the light&mdash;the
hour of cold and stillness, when seconds are numbered till the
whole of nature stirs. The hunter, from his hiding, watched the
leaden surface of the pool&mdash;watched rather the reeds and
big-leaved plants that hung above it faintly lifting in the
wind.</p>

<p>Suddenly he raised his gun&mdash;softly, softly&mdash;for meat
was scarce&mdash;he could not miss his shot&mdash;and the big
leaves were stirring now with something more persistent than the
wind. He half rose from his haunches, while his finger twitched the
trigger back&mdash;and then, just in time to be saved the
Unimaginable Sin, his eyes were opened, and he saw.</p>

<p>Saw a figure as of a man&mdash;yet not a man, but shadowy,
semi-translucent, as of ethereal stuff&mdash;saw it part the big
leaves, come out through the bowing reeds&mdash;descend into the
little pool and bathe. And then, just as the first ray of the sun
shot through the forest, the witness saw it arise again from the
water, and, lo&mdash;no longer shadowy, but shining white
&mdash;all glistening.</p>

<p>And so, all glistening, did it disappear, in silence, as it had
come.</p>

<p>The hunter, as soon as his limbs would carry him, ran back to
his barrio with the story. That night five neighbours returned with
him to the forest, and, from as far away as they could see the
water-hole, awaited the hour.</p>

<p>Their reward was great. For they, too, saw the Vision, exactly
as their companion had done.</p>

<p>&quot;It is the Christ!&quot; they whispered, and, having
prayed, themselves descended to the sacred pool and bathed.</p>

<p>Then they went home and told their world. Thereafter each night
some chosen few lay awaiting the vision that always came with dawn.
And each day, all day, hundreds bathed in that little pool,
stirring the water till it was thick, crowding it full&mdash;while
the fame of it spread on and on.</p>

<p>On till it reached the ears of a young American constabulary
lieutenant of the sort that made the name of the Force. And this
young person conceived it to be his duty to look into the case.</p>

<p>So, taking a man or two from his detachment, he repaired to the
forest. There, duly hidden, but close beside the spot at which the
Vision was wont to descend, he, too, lay still and watched, though
the people, in their far concealment, knew nothing of his
presence.</p>

<p>The hour came&mdash;and the miracle. Truly enough, in all things
as had been told, a shadowy, silent figure, parting the big-leaved
plants and the bowing reeds, stepped forth and down, into the pool,
and bathed. Then, with the sun, did it rise again, all shining,
glistening white, and vanish into the bush.</p>

<p>Yet not this time in silence&mdash;for silence fled before a
boy&#39;s clear ringing laugh and a frightened cry. He had made a
dash for the Vision&mdash;had that American officer boy&mdash;and
it had shrieked in fear.</p>

<p>For the Vision was naught but a poor out-cast leper, a brown man
like the rest, whose sick flesh, being wet, shone white in the
level sun.</p>

<p>With such material had our health officers to deal. Under such
dangers from themselves did the people of the Philippines live. Nor
has either condition materially changed since our occupation.
Twenty-five years of public schools cannot wipe out the inheritance
of all time. Yet, measured by the microscope&mdash;the clock of
ages&mdash;there is an advance.</p>

<p>Dr. Heiser, at Culion, built up a great preventive and
palliative work. His colony, started with 600 members, grew
rapidly, and although the sick still hid and were hidden, to the
menace of all the world, yet more and more of them gave themselves
up, lured by the comforts of Culion and by the hope of cure.</p>

<p>But there was no cure.</p>

<p>&quot;I have never felt so ashamed and humiliated,&quot; says
Dr. Heiser, &quot;as I used to feel when going through that huge
leper hospital, unable to give any real hope. I found no record,
anywhere, of leprosy cured, not any record of great scientific
effort made. The care of lepers, since history began, had always
been left to charity. It was high time to set science to work.</p>

<p>&quot;It was then that I heard of chaulmoogra oil, with its
surmisable possibilities. But the nature of the stuff, as we soon
proved, made it practically unassimilable. And, hypodermi-cally
given, it would not absorb. So, we called upon a great German firm
for aid. They suggested adding ether, or camphor. We added ether.
The mixture did absorb&mdash;and then, for the first time in the
world&#39;s ken, came progress.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But the great difficulty so far,&quot; Dr. Heiser
continued, &quot;was that it took six months to get results. About
this time&mdash;1915 &mdash;I joined the Rockefeller Foundation and
went to India. There I found a great Englishman, Sir Leonard
Rogers, knighted for his work in dysentery, and asked him to take
up our leprosy question.</p>

<p>&quot;&#39;We have found the first rung in the ladder of
cure,&#39; I said, &#39;but we can&#39;t, grope as we will, find
the second. Help!&#39;</p>

<p>&quot;So Sir Leonard fell to work. And his gift was a cut of the
period from six months to three.</p>

<p>&quot;Soon afterward Doctors Hollman and Dean, who were working
on leprosy in Honolulu under a Congressional appropriation, made
further progress.</p>

<p>&quot;They isolated the ethyl esters and successfully used them
in the treatment of leprosy.</p>

<p>&quot;And this is the medicament that is actually curing lepers
to-day&mdash;one of the most satisfactory achievements in medical
discovery.</p>

<p>&quot;I have visited most leper colonies in the world. They used
to be heartbreaking. Now, having introduced the treatment in a
given place, I come back a few months later to find faces all
alight with hope and patients eager and anxious to tell all about
it&mdash;about when they are getting out of hospital, about what
they are going to do with their lives in the world that has been
given back to them.</p>

<p>&quot;Of those who contract leprosy henceforth it is reasonable
to hope that over 20 per cent may be cured; in over 60 per cent the
malady will be so arrested as to disappear clinically; and in the
remainder it will go no farther&mdash;if it is taken up within the
first three or four years of its onset,&quot;</p>

<h2>Chapter XV &mdash; THE PRAYER OF THE LIVING DEAD</h2>

<p>But while these glorious things were shining forth in the broad
wide world, down upon the Philippine Islands thick darkness had
settled. Harrison had come. Filipinization, sweeping through every
branch of public work, was rapidly destroying all that
America&#39;s science and service had accomplished. And the
defenceless victims in Culion must share the doom of the rest. The
simple truth of this may be sufficiently illustrated by the case of
the Culion children.</p>

<p>It is established, then, that children born of leprous parents
not only are born clean, but also grow up clean, if removed from
the parents and protected from exposure. In Honolulu, during the
entire thirty years of American control, not one child of leprous
parentage has developed the disease.</p>

<p>In Culion, as in Honolulu, our practice was to isolate all
children so born. And in Culion as in Honolulu, of those so
protected not a single child contracted the malady.</p>

<p>Then came Mr. Harrison&#39;s r&eacute;gime, general
Filipinization, Dr. Reiser&#39;s departure and, in Culion as
elsewhere, the consequent disregarding or discarding of modern
standards. <i>During this period over three hundred children born
in Culion fell victim to the curse.</i></p>

<p>All scientific work, whether pathological or alleviative, died
down or out, and the legislature that voted &quot;money to
burn&quot; into the Philippine National Bank&mdash;and freely
burned it there &mdash;had little indeed to spare to the prisoners
of death. In 1918, when Dr. Denny, last American superintendent,
gave up his hopeless struggle and left, two physicians constituted
Culion&#39;s medical corps, charged with the study and care of
nearly 4,000 sick.</p>

<p>Then, March 5, 1921, came the disappearance of Harrison. Two
months later the Wood-Forbes Commission, landing in Manila, turned
its searchlight on the Islands. And its rays swept the chill of
fear into the souls of the caciques, seven fat years care-free. So
they actually appropriated $50,000 for Culion, and sent four of
their doctors down to administer the cure.</p>

<p>But service that serves is wont to spring from roots other than
fear.</p>

<p>Now, if you stop to look over the main elements in the matter,
you get something like this:</p>

<p>Leprosy, from the day that Moses commanded the stricken to cry
out &quot;unclean!&quot; has been the loathing and the terror of
the world.</p>

<p>Leprosy, for reasons as yet undetermined, spreads more rapidly
in some places than in others, and spreads in the Philippines with
extreme speed; so that the Filipinos, as has already been stated,
suffer more generally from its ravages than do many other recorded
people.</p>

<p>Leprosy, so science holds, is transmitted only by contact, and
can be utterly stamped out by segregation of the afflicted.</p>

<p>Leprosy can lie dormant and hidden for fifteen years or more
after the infection, and, during all that period, can be carried
about and transmitted to others by the infected person.</p>

<p>America, at home, receives Filipinos into her schools and
colleges, into her domestic service, into many close
contacts&mdash;receives them freely, and desires so to do.
Filipinos and Filipino goods travel freely in all countries by all
conveniences. The Philippines are visited by the ships of the
world. And the American Government, as holding supreme authority in
the Philippines, is responsible to its own American people and to
all mankind for safety in these personal contacts and business
dealings&mdash;for due observance of laws of common weal.</p>

<p>Finally, to American science and devotion, brilliantly aided by
British and by German skill, is due the honour of finding a leprosy
cure.</p>

<p>Having then, the authority, the responsibility and the cure, had
America a choice but to spring to her task?</p>

<p>Governor-General Wood thought not. When he took office, in the
autumn of 1921, fresh pictures lived in his memory, close knowledge
in his mind, that forbade a day&#39;s delay in going to the rescue
of these most friendless of earth&#39;s lost. The journeys of the
Wood-Forbes Commission had laid bare before him a world of secret
pities and of secret threats.</p>

<p>So, he threw himself into the rescue.</p>

<p>Things, then, began to happen fast. By the end of 1921 ethyl
esters were being administered to 1,000 Culion patients. Then a
Legislature as yet on good behaviour increased the appropriation.
In addition the Governor-General levied on the emergency fund. In
1922 Culion&#39;s staff rose to eighteen physicians, twenty-one
trained nurses besides the always devoted nuns, and several minor
members, with over 4,000 cases under the new treatment.</p>

<p>Once a month, at least, the <i>Apo</i> carried the
Governor-General himself to Culion&mdash;a night&#39;s journey by
sea. There his scientific knowledge, as physician bred, enabled him
to give the most intelligent stimulus and support to the
pathological and medical work, and his active sympathy with the
patients themselves produced a bettering of conditions such as
surpassed their experience in a lifetime.</p>

<p>For the first time in years, so they themselves affirm, they
slept warm at night, had sufficient clothing to wear, had food
enough to keep their hunger down, had real nurses and doctors to
look to their pains. For the first time after years during which,
they say, they &quot;were forgotten by God and man.&quot;</p>

<p>Interesting things&mdash;too intimate or too involving, for the
most part, to be set down in print&mdash;are to be learned of all
these matters by conversation with Culion&#39;s folk. It was one of
the rare saints of the earth&mdash;one of those who find happiness
in close continuous service of a sort that only divine love could
endure, who added this:</p>

<p>&quot;You hear it said that lepers&#39; minds are
dulled&mdash;that they neither suffer nor are grateful and glad
like other people. It is not true. You have only to see their
touching greetings to the Governor-General to realize that. They
exhaust their powers of expression before him when he comes. They
go out to meet him with banners. Again and again they have come to
me begging: &#39;Show us what we can do to make sure that he really
knows how much we love and pray him never to go
away.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p>And when, in November, 1922, a rumour reached Culion that
General Wood was really about to leave the Islands to become head
of the University of Pennsylvania, they hurried together their
knowledge of English in a long petition of which the following is a
part:</p>

<blockquote>We, the undersigned, unfortunate inmates of the Culion
Leper Colony, desire to express...our endless gratitude for the
many helps you have already bestowed upon us, both in your personal
and official capacity...<br>
<br>
We humbly beg and petition your Excellency not to abandon us
without the assurance that the great and noble work you have
undertaken for the despised lepers shall be continued...Not a ray
of hope shone across our dark and gloomy pathway until you became
interested in our terrible misfortune. With your coming, a new star
shone above our narrow horizon&mdash;<i>The Star of Hope.</i> For
the first time in our desolate lives an active interest has been
taken in our welfare...Hope has become the very essence of our
lives. Through your vivid interest, the new treatment has been
extended to us, and if same is continued we hope and look forward
to the day when we shall be able to depart from this prison...to
take up once more the...life we left behind us when this terrible
malady marked us as its victims, and thus be able to contribute our
grain of sand and do our bit for the prosperity and welfare of our
dear County. A new trail, thanks to your interest in our behalf,
has been blazed for us across the vale of despondency and despair,
leading to a new and wonderful existence...<br>
<br>
...The world can never deny that before you came our newly risen
<i>Star of Hope</i> was not known then, the world cared very little
for our sufferings and miserable existence; and we were left only
to eke out our misfortune, the gaping jaws of an open grave
claiming us as its prey.<br>
<br>
However conditions have now changed considerably, thanks to the
timely arrival of your Excellency, the acclaimed <i>Saviour of we
Lepers.</i> When you leave our shores, please be assured that you
shall carry with you the everlasting gratitude and fond memories of
unfortunates who have found in your Excellency the angel and
conductor of their alleviation and hope for better days to
come...</blockquote>

<p>This document bore the signatures of well over thirteen hundred
of Culion&#39;s sick.</p>

<p>The Governor-General early named an able American scientist, Dr.
H. Windsor Wade, to be chief pathologist of the Colony, and
requested him to act as chief physician until some well-trained
specialist could be found for the job.</p>

<p>This specialist, unfortunately, was not forthcoming, a fact
resulting in the deflection of the chief pathologist&#39;s labour,
to a considerable extent, from the most important feature of the
work. For even above the succour of the individual must rank the
search for the keys to the safety of the world.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, splendid progress was made&mdash;although figures
on actual accomplishment are only by degrees available. For the
malady is slow&mdash;slow in developing, slow in killing, slow in
improvement under treatment.</p>

<p>Meantime the reports of betterment, of probable cures, spread
through the Islands like dawn after night. Hundreds of lepers who
had still remained in hiding came forward and begged to be taken to
the Island. Rarely, if ever, was it necessary to invoke police
power to bring in any victim, however ignorant or
timorous&mdash;the good news itself was enough. And every possible
step was taken by the Governor-General to spread that news and to
aid and popularize the movement.</p>

<p>In spite of again increased appropriations, however, the money
available did not suffice to carry on the work in the best way.
Only about one-third of the sum total could be spared to the
curative treatment, the rest being necessary for the bare
maintenance, shelter and clothing of the sick. And trained help was
lacking for the proper keeping of records essential to farther
development of the cure.</p>

<p>But the number of &quot;negatives&quot; was steadily rising and
the work, as a whole, was such as to focus upon Culion the
attention of the pathologists of the world.</p>

<p>Then came &quot;the Crisis&quot;&mdash;the pol&iacute;ticos&#39;
declaration of war on Governor-General Wood. And to one curious in
the psychology of the educated Filipino few things could be found
more illuminating than the relation of that &quot;Crisis&quot; to
the fate of the Philippines&#39; helpless sick.</p>

<p>The Governor-General, by word and deed, had made his own keen
interest in the victims of leprosy, in their rescue, and in the
protection of the well, a constantly conspicuous fact.</p>

<p>Therefore, true to form, the Big Caciques, to hurt him, struck
hard at the lepers, struck hard at Culion. And all their followers
followed on.</p>

<p>The Filipino medical staff on the Island accordingly raised its
voice in protest against the Executive&#39;s visits, as
&quot;interference.&quot; Dr. Wade became the object of fantastic
accusations and criticism. Every imaginable obstacle, petty or
great, was placed in the way of his work. By word of mouth and
through the native press tales were sedulously spread abroad of
misery and unhappiness at Culion and of ill-treatment endured by
the patients, who, it was alleged, were made the subject of
frivolous and useless experiments, while the money that should have
fed and clothed them was consumed in labora-torical tricks.</p>

<p>The death rate was said to be soaring.</p>

<p>Finally, after a long barrage of words, the Caciques showed the
seriousness of their attack by an extreme measure. Taking a leaf
from Washington&#39;s own book, they announced a
&quot;Probe&quot;&mdash;a &quot;Senate Investigating
Committee&quot; which would voyage to Culion itself and determine
the truth.</p>

<p>When the hour came, however, senatorial courage had somehow
oozed away. Just one Senator, plus one Representative, reported at
the gangplank as still for the trip, the rest of the party
consisting of Filipino doctors, with a pair of American
&quot;observers only.&quot;</p>

<p>Their investigation began on the afternoon of January 4, 1924.
Twenty-four hours later they had already shaken Cu-lion&#39;s dust
from their feet and were steaming back to Manila. But even in those
few hours they had got their &quot;facts.&quot; Upon which it was
solemnly announced, among other wisdoms, that Culion represents a
useless dissipation of funds; that &quot;segregation of lepers, as
a measure of control, is a failure,&quot; that laboratory equipment
appropriations should be cut off forthwith; that Dr. Wade lacked
thorough knowledge of the peculiarities of the disease; that the
first essential to improvement was the appointment of a
&quot;competent Filipino doctor as chief physician.&quot;</p>

<p>Publicity was also given to the idea that &quot;the isolation of
non-leprous children of the patients is of secondary
importance,&quot; and Director De Jesus, of the Health Service, was
quoted as saying that &quot;the lepers resent the present system of
treatment, stating that the results are fatal.&quot;
<i><sup>1</sup></i></p>

<p class="sup"><sup>1</sup> Culion despatch, January 5, 1924, in
<i>Philippines Herald,</i> January 6, 1924.</p>

<p>Meantime, the function of the political Filipino with regard to
Filipino lepers had become and definitely remained that of
hostility. Under cover of a solicitude entirely new, he actually
began to give thought to the leper&#39;s case. But the whole trend
of that thought was, in effect, carefully to see to it that nothing
of any moment was done for the benefit of the sick.</p>

<p>In the new cure, the patient, from the moment he is first
declared &quot;negative,&quot; should be re-examined every week,
over a period of two years. At the end of the two years, if no
reappearance of disease has occurred, he is free. Now, in the
beginning of 1924, negative cases were already becoming
satisfactorily numerous. And the Governor-General&#39;s strong
desire was to make a separate colony for these cases near, but
apart from, the Culion settlement; a colony where negatives could
live in safety from re-infection, yet enjoy the regular service and
supervision of Culion&#39;s experts.</p>

<p>But this, like his desire to save the little untainted babies,
was doomed. Doomed simply because it was America&#39;s
representative that desired it. &quot;It is unpatriotic,&quot;
Quezon had declared, &quot;for any Filipino to stand by
Governor-General Wood in his policies.&quot; And a definite and
persistent effort set in, not only to block progress in discovery,
but to break up Culion itself and disperse the patients.</p>

<p>&quot;We don&#39;t see,&quot; Filipino physicians declared,
&quot;why any American surgeon should be allowed to come here and
make himself famous by getting data at Culion and writing books
about our lepers. That is unjust exploitation of our resources. It
should be saved until there are Filipino scientists and we can get
the credit of it ourselves.&quot;</p>

<p>Yet, lest it be supposed that all native medical men will be
found in one class, here is a statement transcribed from the lips
of a first-class Manila physician not in the politico field:</p>

<p>&quot;Professionally, I consider that there was and is no need
of any &#39;investigation&#39; of Culion. Dr. Wade was appointed as
the best man available. He is a very good pathologist. A lot of
money has been spent in Culion, it is true, but time has not been
permitted it to demonstrate its value. Dr. Wade will probably now
resign. They will force him out, through his own natural
pride.&quot;</p>

<p>For comparison, and again from my notes, take the exact words of
a Filipino politico to whom no one would deny a place among the
half-dozen best.</p>

<p>&quot;This Culion matter is a serious grievance. A very great
deal of money has been allotted to Culion, and all because of
Governor-General Wood. Before his coming, I assure you, no such
attention was ever devoted by us to people like lepers. Oh, yes. No
doubt it would be a fine thing for the world if a cure for leprosy
were discovered. But we do not feel that it is incumbent upon us to
make that contribution.&quot;</p>

<p>It is a continual regret and a heavy handicap to be unable to
give the names of witnesses. The Filipino public man who made the
following statement has been taken entirely seriously in America in
his several visits there.</p>

<p>&quot;In the Culion matter,&quot; I said to him&mdash;this was
in January, 1924&mdash;&quot;it would seem that your Government is
actuated by a desire to make a personal attack upon
Governor-General Wood.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That is partly true,&quot; he replied. &quot;But the
proportion of the appropriation for health work allotted to Culion
is terrible. I do not know just what it is, but it is terrible. It
is more economic to help in other things. Malaria, for example. I
am always having to send medicine down to my labourers on my
plantation, who have malaria. I can&#39;t get Government money to
buy that medicine. No. I have to pay for it myself out of my own
pocket! This is not economic.</p>

<p>&quot;But the main point is just here:</p>

<p>&quot;We know that in America you think a great deal of what you
call welfare work and admire a man who excels in it. Very well. We
consider that, in Culion, General Wood is simply making a
spectacular demonstration of welfare work, to gain popularity in
America, and we are determined he shall not succeed. He is
overdoing this Culion stunt [sic] and we are going to stop
him.&quot;</p>

<p>But it may be that a still more deeply significant testimony is
born in the words of another confidential speaker&mdash;a rare type
of Filipino professional man&mdash;one to be respected as an honest
and well-meaning citizen whose whole intent is to steer clear of
political bonds and to do what he may for his people.</p>

<p>&quot;Before the Governor-General came, Culion was,&quot; he
said. &quot;Its troubles are simply lack of money. And there would
be very much more money for that and for schools and for every good
work if only our pol&iacute;ticos had not so thoroughly plundered
the National Bank. But as to leprosy&mdash;you know we are not as
afraid of that as you are. We are always, at bottom, opposed to
segregation. Family ties with us are strong. We do not consider the
disease very horrible and we want to keep our lepers in our own
households at home.&quot;</p>

<h2>Chapter XVI &mdash; A GREAT PHYSICIAN</h2>

<p>The history of our health work in the Islands, from 1900 on, is
a matter of first-rate significance not to be overlooked or
minimized in any intelligent consideration of the status of the
Filipino people and of America&#39;s relations thereto.</p>

<p>When we took over the Philippines, the task of sanitation
confronting us was so enormous as to seem impossible. Smallpox was
carrying off a regular annual toll of 40,000 persons. Asiatic
cholera came in frequent and devastating waves. Infantile
mortality&mdash;due chiefly to beriberi, which meant malnutrition,
and to tetanus, which meant dirty handling at birth, reached 773.4
per thousand. Beriberi among adults killed its multitudes each
year. The city water of Manila was poi-sonously contaminated and
nowhere else in all the Islands was there a reservoir, a pipe-line
or an artesian well. In the city cemeteries, four or five bodies
were often crowded into a single grave, only to be tossed out a few
months later to lie exposed in heaps in the open air. The city of
Manila, with a population of over 200,000 persons, had no sewage
system, whatever and lay encircled by a moat among a network of
canals, all of which were filled with half-stagnant house sewage
constantly stirred about by cargo craft in passage.</p>

<p>No food law obtained and the vilest sort of food products were
shipped into the country and consumed there. Dysentery carried off
its annual thousands. Leprosy existed everywhere and spread
unchecked. For some million wild people living in a primitive state
no effective attempt had ever been made to furnish medical
relief.</p>

<p>In all the archipelago not one modernly equipped hospital
existed. Countless deaths occurred, as well as countless shocking
deformities resulting from injuries or sores, all of which could
easily have been escaped through ordinary skilled attention. The
prisons throughout the Islands were filthy and neglected beyond
permissible description here. To quote Dr. Heiser<sup>1</sup> on
that first period:</p>

<p class="sup"><sup>1</sup> Dr. Victor G. Heiser, &quot;Sanitation
in the Philippines,&quot; <i>Journal of Raes Development,</i>
October, 1912.</p>

<blockquote>In the days prior to American control, the maritime
quarantine was conducted upon a basis of graft, with the inevitable
result that an outbreak of any dangerous communicable disease, like
plague, cholera or smallpox, in the nearby foreign countries, meant
the early introduction of the disease into the Philippines. There
was no proper inspection of animals before slaughter and suitable
slaughter-houses where this work could have been done were
conspicuous by their absence. Malaria prevailed in hundreds of
towns, without quinine being available to combat it. It was no
infrequent experience to find imitation quinine pills being sold at
fabulous prices in the stricken districts, and the poor populace
had no one to whom to apply with the hope of receiving
relief...<br>
<br>
Sections of Manila having a population of from 5,000 to 25,000,
were built up with houses so closely crowded together that there
was no room for streets or alleys, and egress from these sections
had in many instances to be made by the residents crawling under
one another&#39;s houses. Manila is located on a tidal flat,
and...at high tide about half the city was inundated. As this flat
land consisted of soft oozy mud [and as provisions for human waste
were of the rudest if they existed at all] the conditions can be
better imagined than described.<br>
<br>
There was no governmental provision for the insane, and it was no
uncommon sight to see these unfortunates tied to a stake under a
house or in a yard, with a dog-chain, and it often happened that
during fires, which are so frequent in towns built of &ntilde;ipa
[palm-leaves] they were burned because no one thought to release
them. Foods and perishable provisions were sold under most filthy
conditions...Tuberculosis was responsible each year for perhaps
50,000 deaths through the archipelago. No effort whatsoever was
made to teach the people how to deal with this
scourge.</blockquote>

<p>No effort, indeed, had been made to deal with anything. The
entire population, from bottom to top, was content with things as
they were ; entirely indisposed to agree that any part of their
taxes should be used for sanitary purposes; and entirely determined
to resist and resent any attempt to induce them to alter either
their personal habits or their surrounding conditions.</p>

<p>&quot;It is impossible to reform the Oriental. Your effort would
be wasted. Let him live as he likes. He will do that anyway. Spend
your strength in safeguarding the health of your own people who
come out to govern. That is our policy and you will find it the
only wise and practical one,&quot; said other foreign medical
officers, from their observation points in the various surrounding
colonies.</p>

<p>Add to this professional discouragement the fact that whatever
was to be done must be done by allottment from Philippine insular
revenues only, and you have some suggestion of the task that faced
our health officers at the start. And, as if to support the
prophets of woe, hardly had the work begun when the Islands were
attacked by one of the worst outbreaks of cholera of modern
times.</p>

<p>In the struggle that followed our men learned that &quot;the
passive resistance of the Oriental&quot;&mdash;as one of them
wrote&mdash;&quot;is a very much more subtle and difficult force to
overcome than is the active opposition so frequently encountered in
the temperate zone. It was soon learned that there was nothing to
be gained by using actual force.&quot;</p>

<p>Next, an outbreak of bubonic plague, involving the Chinese
population as well as the Filipinos, still farther demonstrated the
fact that nothing could be accomplished without considerable
deference to local superstition and prejudices, and without such
compromises as would gain the adherence of Filipinos influential
among the mass.</p>

<p>For even the most intelligent of the people believed in their
hearts that the purpose of our new-fangled health measures was
merely to make miserable, unhappy and uncomfortable the native
denizen of the soil. To combat this idea we organized three hundred
boards of health throughout the Islands, putting Filipinos in
charge, and bringing the Filipinos to Manila for a course of
instruction in modern sanitation and hygiene. As soon as these
began to understand, they were interested. And when they tried our
anti-disease rules and found virtue therein, they inclined
considerably to influence their fellow countrymen.</p>

<p>It should be added that our best ally, in all this labour, was
the Roman Catholic priesthood.</p>

<p>Meantime, tackling the smallpox curse, we planned to vaccinate
the entire archipelago. Our first idea was to give our new Filipino
health boards charge of the vaccination of their several districts.
But this proved impracticable. For the Filipino health officer
quickly developed the characteristic of excusing from vaccination
not only his own friends, but also all other persons possessing any
sort of influence that might somehow, somewhere, some day be used
to his disadvantage.</p>

<p>Dr. Reiser, our Director of Health, therefore invented a new
plan. This was to have an American physician, with a staff of
twenty or thirty vaccinators, begin at one boundary of a province
and literally march across it, making as he advanced a carefully
checked, clean and inclusive sweep of every human creature.</p>

<p>Up to this time, in the six provinces immediately surrounding
Manila, some six thousand deaths from smallpox had occurred each
year since the memory of man. In the year following the complete
vaccination campaign not one death from smallpox occurred. Nor did
the disease recur while this r&eacute;gime lasted.</p>

<p>In 1913, after ten years of work, Dr. Heiser was able to report
an enormous progress. Not only the six provinces, but every part of
the archipelago to which it was possible to convey vaccine in a
potent condition had been almost entirely freed from smallpox. Over
ten million vaccinations had been performed. Five thousand lepers
had been segregated&mdash;a thing new in the Orient&mdash;and the
spread of leprosy had been brought under control. Plague had been
completely extirpated.</p>

<p>Cholera had lost its terrors. Amoebic dysentery had been greatly
reduced, partly by educational work, partly by the introduction of
better drinking water.</p>

<p>Manila had been given a clean and modern water supply and a
modern sewer system&mdash;the first in the Orient&mdash;on which
her death-rate dropped more than 1800 annually. Her horrible moat
and canals had been cleaned of their centuries&#39; accumulation of
sewage. Her streets, that had been channels of filth, were swept
daily and her garbage nightly removed, so that she was now one of
the clean towns of the world. Crematories had been built and decent
cemeteries provided, where the dead, singly interred, might lie in
peace till Doomsday.</p>

<p>Wide streets and alleys had been cut through the congested
districts, affording light, air and a means of approach, so that
garbage carts could get in; and so that, on the appearance of a
dangerous communicable disease, the case could be quickly reached
and quickly removed to a modern hospital built for that purpose.
This detail alone&mdash;this making of entrance-ways&mdash;effected
an inestimable improvement in the health of the city.</p>

<p>A modern insane hospital had been erected in Manila. We had also
built a large General Hospital&mdash;the best-equipped in the
Eastern hemisphere, comparable with the best in Europe or America.
Here were treated 80,000 persons a year in the out-patient clinic
alone&mdash;persons to whom no sort of relief had before been
available.</p>

<p>A nursing school, with over 300 young Filipino men and women as
students, by 1913 had already graduated two classes. A medical
school, under high-class American specialists, was graduating local
doctors from sound, stiff courses. A modern hospital had been
constructed in the very heart of the wild man&#39;s country, where
it was doing excellent work.</p>

<p>An anti-tuberculosis campaign had been organized with
well-scattered dispensaries; with treatment camps and a mountain
hospital for incipient cases; with a hospital in Manila for chronic
patients; and with an active educational section that did all that
is done in the most enlightened American community.</p>

<p>The jails throughout the Islands had been cleaned, and the
loathsome skin diseases of the prisoners cured. Beriberi&#39;s
cause and cure had been discovered and its huge death-rate cut
low.</p>

<p>Food laws had been framed and enforced. Model sanitary markets
had been built and the sale of all perishable foodstuffs severely
restricted thereto&mdash;a provision that gives the purchaser the
maximum choice for the minimum effort, that gives the dealer the
advantage of close contact with his competitors and that gives the
Health Service the advantage of being able economically to control
the public food supply with a small inspection force.</p>

<p>And in Manila, first of all the world, was invoked the control
of &quot;carriers&quot; in hotels and restaurants&mdash;a rule
whereby no servant may work in any place where food is sold without
a health certificate showing that he is free from germs likely to
convey disease.</p>

<p>These few points just enumerated are far from covering the
ground of actual accomplishment. But they will show why it was
that, during the last four years of the period in
question&mdash;the period from 1900 to 1913&mdash;representatives
from Japan, China, Great Britain, France, Holland, Spain&mdash;from
practically every nation concerned in the Far East&mdash;came to
the Philippines to study the new methods that had brought about
such amazing results. The effect, in many countries, was great. The
experiment that their medical experts had laughed to naught, as the
dream of an altruist, had been put to the test of practice on a
large scale, had stood the trial of years and now wore the crown of
indisputable and brilliant success. The medical literature
resulting was proving of unequalled scientific value. The example,
altogether, was of the sort that enforces a following.</p>

<p>And not the smallest of the results was an indirect
one&mdash;the drawing together in hitherto unknown friendly council
and co-operation of the medical men of all the Far East, to
th&eacute; great saving, everywhere, of life, effort and human
values.</p>

<p>This giant American achievement in the Far East is largely due
to the genius, devotion and great administrative ability of one
man, Dr. Victor G. Reiser. Dr. Heiser, in the beginning of his
Philippine work, set himself the task of saving 50,000 lives a
year. When he laid his office down he had bettered that number by
an annual 25,000.</p>

<p>This he did over an area of about 100,000 square miles, working
under a civil government, and by persuasion only, never resorting
to force.</p>

<p>In estimating the meaning of figures, the fairest comparison
will be found in our health campaign in the Panama Canal Zone, for
whose effectiveness we justly expect praise. There our land area
embraced only 357.1 square miles, which, in reality meant only a
few square miles for the sanitarian to handle.</p>

<p>Briefly, the funds for the sanitation of the Canal Zone came
without stint from a generous United States Congress. And they
could be spent without hindrance&mdash;without waiting to educate
public opinion&mdash;in directly advancing the construction of the
Canal. In the Philippines, on the other hand, every dollar had to
be wrung from a Filipino legislature and progress could be made
only as public opinion was gradually educated to accept improvement
in health conditions. What that means, in a backward, suspicious,
passively resisting Oriental population can with difficulty be
imagined by the Occidental mind. Finally, for the sanitation of
Panama, there was available, annually, $3.65 per capita. In the
Philippines the work was done at a per capita cost of a little more
than ten cents.</p>

<p>Such was the status of our health work in the Philippines in
1913&mdash;in which year Governor-General Harrison allowed the
Filipino politicians to assume control.</p>

<p>The result was: first, the payment, by the Filipinos themselves,
of a fearful toll levied in coin of human lives; and, second, a
mortal threat not only to America, but to the whole world of
humanity.</p>

<p>One single item in the record is 100,000 deaths by smallpox, 92
per cent of which occurred among children born since 1914 and never
properly vaccinated; for vaccination under Filipinized control
rapidly relapsed into a farce.</p>

<p>Typhoid, dysentery, tuberculosis, beriberi quickly increased.
Cholera, for many years absent, now reappeared in menacing form,
got quickly out of hand and seized its victims by the mounting
thousands. Malaria became again a sweeping pestilence, in two years
carrying off over 90,000 souls. And Dr. Reiser&#39;s provision, by
which pure quinine was dispensed at a nominal price in every
post-office in the islands, rapidly sank into oblivion and disuse.
By the coming of the Wood-Forbes Commission, in 1921, not a trace
of the practice remained and pure quinine was again beyond the
reach of the common people, while the sale of bogus quinine at
exorbitant rates had become an industry.</p>

<p>As an early and direct exercise of greater autonomy, the
Filipino Legislature reduced the already meagre Health
appropriation by one-third. But Dr. Heiser, whom public opinion in
America sustained in office while other heads fell&mdash;Dr. Heiser
met that move in a characteristic way.</p>

<p>&quot;Gentlemen,&quot; said he, &quot;you are cutting my funds.
Very well. Then, naturally, I must cut my expenditures. You have
many thousands of insane in these Islands. But in the asylums,
which, as you know, are as yet very inadequate, we have only a few
hundred of the worst and most violent cases. These I can now no
longer maintain. In letting them out upon the community, however, I
must offer some explanation.</p>

<p>&quot;I shall therefore, as I release them into Manila streets,
attach to the person of each a notice, reading:</p>

<p>&quot;&#39;Dangerous Lunatic. Likely to Kill. At Large Because
the Philippine Legislature Refuses to Provide for His
Care.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;As to the lepers:&mdash;I must now, of course, reduce the
accommodation at Culion. And those thousands of helpless sick
people cannot be abandoned on that distant island; therefore, I
shall use some of the remaining money in my hands to hire ships and
bring them to Manila. My money will then be exhausted.</p>

<p>&quot;So, I shall liberate them on this town, directly on their
arrival.</p>

<p>&quot;Some of them are rather terrible to see, and all are
extremely dangerous to have about. Therefore that, too, will need
an explanation, which I shall provide, on a large official notice
attached to the body of each leper. The notice will read:</p>

<p>&quot;&#39;Released, and at Large Because the Legislature
Refuses to Appropriate Funds for His Care.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p>Nor were these idle threats. The American Director of Health
meant every word he said. This his hearers knew&mdash;knew also
that he would carry out his promise to the last detail.</p>

<p>They therefore reconsidered forcing his action and made the
appropriations required.</p>

<p>In the long run, however, victory remained with the
pol&iacute;ticos. Gradually they sapped, mined and destroyed the
great work of the preceding decade. And Dr. Heiser, seeing the
inevitable outcome, dropped a useless struggle, to take up in its
stead the Directorship of the East of the International Health
Board of the Rockefeller Foundation.</p>

<p>Attacking the people&#39;s health defence at its roots, politics
now almost completely dominated the University of the Philippines.
The University Medical School had never actually applied for
official rating in America. Had it done so at any time previous to
Filipinization, it would undoubtedly have been accorded Class A
standard. But after seven years of Mr. Harrison&#39;s r&eacute;gime
it was generally conceded that the University of the Philippines
Medical School could not attain C Class by American rating.</p>

<p>Further, it was commonly observed in Manila that any medical
student having a friend on the Board of Control was assured,
whatever his other qualifications or lack of them, of being awarded
marks sufficient to secure his medical degree.</p>

<p>And when a degenerating influence of that kind can reach to
expression in a National University, it is not difficult to imagine
the poison infused through other governmental activities from the
same source.</p>

<p>The Philippine General Hospital, so excellently designed and
built by Dr. Heiser and Mr. Dean C. Worcester, gradually dropped to
its present unpleasant state, wherein scarcely an American,
physician or patient, is able to use it, choosing instead the very
inferiorly housed and equipped private hospitals&mdash;and
responsible care.</p>

<p>And, as a final example of the effect of the change, the Bureau
of Science, that great right arm of health administration and
scientific control, was crippled throughout, or, in some branches
entirely annihilated. This was accomplished, first, by debasing the
institution to the level of a political perquisite ; and, second,
by a wholesale fund-slashing whose object was to crowd American
scientists out of faculty and staff positions. The work done in the
biological laboratory, until then of the most distinguished quality
and of world-wide importance, now no longer enjoyed the confidence
of Manila&#39;s medical profession. And the Bureau&#39;s
publication, the <i>Journal of Science,</i> whose standing had been
eminent throughout the world, soon fell to the point where it yet
remains&mdash;valueless and discredited.</p>

<p>When the Wood-Forbes Commission arrived only a few poor
skeletons, mouldering here and there, remained to show what and
where had been the great health work of America.</p>

<p>This, and some quarter of a million needless deaths, makes one
of the prices that the innocent Filipino people continue to pay for
their Big Caciques&#39; seven years&#39; indulgence in practically
complete &quot;autonomy.&quot;</p>

<p>In making the above statements, as well as some others in this
book, the fact has not been forgotten that the Wood-Forbes report
and Governor-General Wood&#39;s annual messages may in part be
adduced in refutation thereof. But the Wood-Forbes report, with
possibly questionable judgment as events suggest, strained many a
point to favour the picture, and on many a statement let its hope
for the future development of the people colour its view of their
present status. And General Wood in particular has again and again
been guilty of leaning far over backward in the endeavour to
encourage the Filipino leaders to set themselves higher standards
by helping them &quot;save face,&quot; and putting forward the most
charitable view of their record. In return, the Filipino political
leader has not hesitated to make use of unbridled mendacity in
attacking America and her administrators. It therefore seems likely
that a plain statement of fact will render better service both to
America and to the Islands than will any further flattery.</p>

<h2>Chapter XVII &mdash; CHILDREN IN THE DARK</h2>

<p>Brigadier-General Palmer E. Pierce, U.S.A., recalls from
personal experiences with our Philippine Expeditionary Forces an
incident thoroughly illustrative of life in the Islands.</p>

<p>It was late in the fall of 1899. General Pierce, then, of course
a junior officer, was stationed in the town of Dagupan, Province of
Pangasinan. The United States Army&#39;s task, there as elsewhere,
was to bring order into the country and to keep watch, ward and a
regulating hand over the people.</p>

<p>Therefore when, some fifteen miles back in the mountains, a
perfectly new town turned up&mdash;a town without a record, the
army was interested.</p>

<p>The first detail sent out to investigate reported a body of at
least 20,000 natives, living in an obviously brand new
&quot;grass&quot; community most unreasonably planted in poor, wild
land and so removed from sight and access as by that fact alone to
arouse question. But the question carried no visible answer.</p>

<p>So again a detail was despatched&mdash;again and yet again, at
irregular times, by different approaches, to make surprise
visits.</p>

<p>The surprise, however, never came off. On each and every
occasion, as our men neared the place, the town band rose up in its
way, made profound respects, and then, marching first up the leafy
trail, played the surprise party into bounds with loud triumphant
music.</p>

<p>Each succeeding expedition of enquiry returned to camp with the
same blank report as far as essentials were concerned. The town was
an uncommonly good town, they said. Too new to have gathered as yet
much dirt. Uncommonly well laid out, in twelve streets radiating
from a central plaza. Everybody seemed comfortable and happy and,
yes, particularly lazy.</p>

<p>As to why this multitude should so suddenly have appeared in the
spot, as to what kept it there, our officers, after all their
sudden inspections, remained as wise as before.</p>

<p>At last a detachment was sent to live in the place. But even
this, after weeks of observation, added to the information on hand
thus scantily:</p>

<p>The townsfolk seemed to be doing little or no productive work of
any kind, and yet to have food and supplies sufficient for their
comfort.</p>

<p>The head man claimed to be Jesus Christ, and, under that title,
ruled over a populace now grown to 25,000.</p>

<p>The radiating streets divided the town into twelve sections,
over each of which ruled a lieutenant of the head man, each bearing
the name of one or another of the Twelve Apostles.</p>

<p>&quot;Jesus Christ&quot; appeared to be a Spanish mestizo. He
was a very dapper, dandified little chap dressed like a young
peacock and wore always the most splendid top-boots as an essential
to his toilette.</p>

<p>&quot;These people seem thriving,&quot; the resident
officer&#39;s report repeated, &quot;but their means of support is
invisible. And the town is continually and rapidly growing.
Families keep arriving from beyond the boundaries of the
Province&mdash;even from Ilocano towns far to the north. The
organization, whatever it is, works perfectly.&quot;</p>

<p>Meantime a curious succession of murders was occurring,
scattered widely over the district. For example, in one village a
party of eight or ten strange men turned up one day, went straight
to a shack selected apparently at random, plucked out the
inhabitants of the shack, a family of nine people ranging from
grandparents to babies, led the nine to the town plaza and there
summoned all the villagers to assemble.</p>

<p>Then the strangers commanded the villagers to dig a trench in
the middle of the plaza. They dug. When the trench was deep, the
strangers produced rattan strips, bound the legs and arms of their
nine prisoners, flung them bodily into the hole&mdash;grandfather,
babies and all, and ordered the villagers to shovel back the earth
on top and to pack it soundly down.</p>

<p>This done, and the incident finished, the strangers said to the
villagers:</p>

<p>&quot;Now we will have four carabao and certain other supplies
from you. And hereafter, from time to time, we shall want more. If,
when we ask, you do not always promptly comply, we shall merely
come back and bury more families.&quot;</p>

<p>Our officers, hearing of this and other such cases, more than
suspected complicity on the part of the mysterious town. But proof
was wholly lacking.</p>

<p>For the populace at large had grovelled and cringed too long to
lift its head now. The people&#39;s timidity and utter ignorance
inclined them to endure forever, even as they had endured, rather
than risk, by complaints, more punishments, new terrors. Could or
would these strange white soldiers protect them from vengeance if
they were to dare to answer questions and tell the identity of
their tormentors? They did not know. Silence&mdash;their refuge of
ages&mdash;was their safest course.</p>

<p>And yet, even among that driven mass, an occasional spirit may
rise. As happened when one solitary tao tramped from his barrio in
to Dagupan to report to young Captain Palmer E. Pierce, U.S.A.,
provost judge. A party of four, said the tao&mdash;three men and a
woman&mdash;had appeared at his shack demanding his pigs and
chickens.</p>

<p>&quot;Those are for my own family,&quot; the tao had
replied.</p>

<p>&quot;Very well,&quot; said the visitors, &quot;we won&#39;t
bother with you now, but you will shortly have a call from our
soldiers, who will give you the lesson you need.&quot;</p>

<p>Then they had left, at leisure; and the tao, slinking out under
cover of green, had started at top speed for the <i>Americano</i>
post at Dagupan.</p>

<p>The party, he added, came from the Mysterious Town.</p>

<p>After that the thing closed swiftly. In a few hours&#39; time
the tao&#39;s visitors stood before Captain Pierce&#39;s tribunal,
solemnly giving their names as Saint John, Saint Matthew, Saint
Thomas and the Virgin Mary.</p>

<p>Captain Pierce sentenced the men to jail terms. The Virgin
Mary&mdash;a peculiarly grim and black old scarecrow who
un-shakenly and unsmilingly re-asserted her divine
character&mdash;he sent for a sojourn in the guard house.</p>

<p>The news of this action spread abroad, carrying with it a new
confidence in our ability and desire to protect the people. Day by
day they responded by venturing to speak. Presently enough evidence
had accumulated to warrant the arrest of all the leading men of the
Mysterious Town.</p>

<p>In their trial before a military commission, it was now proved
that &quot;Jesus Christ&quot; and four of his Apostles were
directly guilty of many murders and had commanded many more. This
they had done, not because any one had dreamed of resisting their
demands for tribute, but merely to establish and maintain such an
atmosphere of terror as would assure quick service and save them
the trouble of arguing their case.</p>

<p>Messengers sent into more and more distant regions had raised
recruits with the same promise that, in essence, anti-American
politico campaigners use among the masses to-day:</p>

<p>&quot;Come over to us, and the Lord will provide you, freely,
with all that you need. You need never work again. Only sell all
that you have and bring your cash to us.&quot;</p>

<p>The head man and four apostles were hanged. A selection of minor
prophets went to jail. The town was ordered to break up. In a few
weeks twenty-five thousand idle innocents had trudged back over the
hills&mdash;little or no wiser than they came, to return to life in
their original barrios.</p>

<p>One quiet morning years later a fisherman came rushing in from
his work in Manila Bay with a great tale to tell. As he bent over
his net, he had seen bubbles rising in a steady column from the
depths. Looking farther, he perceived that the bubbles, like a
crown of pearls, marked the centre of a shadowy cross stretched
upon the surface of the sea. Greatly amazed, he had dipped his
cocoanut drinking cup into the bubbling stream, tasted it and found
it sweet. Sweet water provided in the midst of the ocean! On that,
he had sped ashore, aflame with his news. A priest, accompanying
the fisherman back to the spot, found the stream and forthwith
blessed it, proclaiming a miracle. Then the whole district of Tondo
flung itself into small boats. And from that moment no one needed
to lead the way, for, day and night, the spot was crowded with
human cargoes, awaiting their turn to drink.</p>

<p>Two days later one of the liveliest epidemics of cholera on
record broke out in the district of Tondo. Dr. Heiser, grappling
with it, quickly discovered the history just narrated. Then he,
also, made a little voyage&mdash;resulting in the discovery that
the unsalted stream and the crown of pearls rose from a cracked
city sewage pipe, whose poisonous contents the people in mounting
thousands were eagerly drinking down. And so great already was the
hold of the thing upon the whole city that Mr. Taft, then Governor,
hesitated forty-eight hours before taking definite action, for fear
lest an insurrection be provoked.</p>

<p>In these incidents, which could be multiplied by hundreds
through all the years and to-day, lies nothing stranger than a
repetition of history. The religion of the conquerors takes into
its own fabric the religion of the conquered, making a composite of
quality according to its parts. The Christianity of Spain, as taken
on by the lowland tribesmen of the Philippines, became an absorbent
of their original religious beliefs. And these were of a type to
select and weld themselves with the apocryphal parts of the new
faith. Thus evolved a childlike and darkling thing upon which the
divine nomenclature stands out with something of a shock.</p>

<p><b>Dr.</b> Manuel Xeres y Burgos, Filipino, testifying before
the Philippine Commission in Manila, September 7, 1899, said:</p>

<blockquote>...the lower class of civilized Filipinos have a very
superficial knowledge of religion and although they practise the
forms of the Catholic religion they still preserve a great many of
their [former] beliefs and customs...[The old creed] was a purely
tribal and pagan religion...In no two places did they have the same
beliefs.</blockquote>

<p>Dr. Trinidad H. Pardo de Tavera, in an address to the
Teachers&#39; Assembly, Baguio, April 23, 1920, speaking of the
education of the Filipino people under the Spaniard up to the end
of the Spanish r&eacute;gime, said:</p>

<blockquote>The only literature accessible to the
Filipinos...consisted of <i>Corridos</i> which constitute the
profane literature, and the <i>Pasiones</i> and the <i>Novenas</i>
which formed the religious reading. <i>Corridos, Pasiones</i> and
<i>Novenas</i> were printed in abundance, in cheap editions, in
Spanish as well as in the dialects of the country.<br>
<br>
The <i>Corridos</i> are stories in verse about historic events,
falsified and fanciful, and love tragedies full of wonderful events
mixed with divine prodigies and diabolical magics.</blockquote>

<p>And the <i>Novenas,</i> religious booklets dedicated to
particular Saints, furnished, Dr. de Tavera affirms, the connecting
bridge between the old faith and the new. He says:</p>

<blockquote>The prodigies mentioned in these <i>Novenas</i> compare
very well with the enchantments, magics and sorceries of the
primitive Filipinos who invoked the propitiation of their divine
spirits by means of ceremonies, sacrifices, charms,...performed by
their <i>mangkuku-lam</i> (witch)...<br>
<br>
All the fear of the mysterious as well as the belief of the
Filipinos in unseen powers which took away life, attracted
misfortunes, gave victory, or conduced to disaster was conserved,
changing only the concepts that they had about the spirits that
governed the affairs of life and the phenomena of
nature.</blockquote>

<p>Dr. de Tavera goes on to speak specifically of the ease with
which a people in the stage of evolution of the simple Filipino
puts uncomprehended phrases of a new faith in the places of old
incantations.</p>

<p>Taking his illustration from the <i>Novena a Jes&uacute;s, Maria
y Jos&eacute;</i> (Manila, 1903) he writes:</p>

<blockquote>A bad man walking in the middle of the night in front
of the church of San Francisco in Cuzco, Peru, saw lights in the
cemetery and knowing it to be a funeral, went to the place to
witness it. Presently he noted that there was a throne where Jesus
Christ was found seated between Mary and Joseph. Then several
demons appeared, each one with a book in his hand. One of them
began accusing a bad woman from Buenos Ayres. &quot;Jesus,&quot;
says the Novena, &quot;pronounced a sentence against her of instant
death and with it eternal perdition.&quot; The demon disappeared in
order to execute the sentence. Another devil read from his book
that in Chile there was another bad woman. &quot;Jesus sentenced
her to death and condemnation.&quot; The devil ran to carry out the
sentence. Another one appeared accusing a bad man of Cuzco, and
this man was precisely the same who tarried to witness the scene at
the cemetery. &quot;When the just judge was about to sentence him
to death,...Blessed Mary and Joseph knelt before the divine Master,
asking mercy on behalf of the accused, alleging that many times he
invoked the holy names (Jes&uacute;s, Mar&iacute;a y Jos&eacute;).
Jesus having denied pardon, his parents begged him anew ..
.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>And so, in the end the bad man escapes punishment, because, says
Dr. de Tavera, of &quot;the invocation <i>&#39;Jes&uacute;s,
Mar&iacute;a y Jos&eacute;&#39;</i> working as a magic
formula...The man in question had no other merit nor is he enjoined
to have one.&quot;</p>

<p>Now &quot;&#39;s&uacute;s-Mar&iacute;a-Jos&eacute;,&quot;
snapped out like a whiplash, is the commonest of oaths among the
Filipino populace.</p>

<p>But the suggestion that a vague border region between new faith
and old is beset with dangerous and bewildering fogs and mazes is
conveyed as follows by Dr. Sixto de los Angeles:
<i><sup>&iacute;</sup></i></p>

<p class="sup"><sup>1</sup> <i>Antropolog&iacute;a Criminal en
Filipinas,</i> p. 119.</p>

<blockquote>Easy credulity...has constituted from the beginning to
this day one of the defects unfortunately so widespread still among
the native inhabitants...As is shown in our annals of the
judiciary, superstition occupies a notable place among the factors
of criminality in this country.</blockquote>

<p><i>&quot;Secula seculorum&quot;</i> the familiar but wholly
uncompre-hended terminal words of many a Latin prayer, are held to
have supplied the name for a sect widely spread among the Islands.
Self-styled &quot;Colorums,&quot; they figure among the most
numerous of many fantastic so-called religious bodies brought into
being between gullibility and greed. And as their fame, in rather
inaccurate shape, has crossed the water, they may the more properly
be chosen to illustrate their class of the present day.</p>

<p>Claim has been made for the Colorums that they are devout
practising Catholics, but so final an authority as Father Francis
X. A. Byrne, S.J., the distinguished Director of the Jesuit College
in Manila, is quoted as definitely denying that they are Roman
Catholics in any sense at all.</p>

<p>For a considerable number of years the Colorum sect has been
known in the Islands in various places. Mr. Worcester, writing in
1914,<sup>2</sup> speaks of its having a headquarters on Mt. San
Crist&oacute;bal, where persons paid large sums to get speech from
an oracle whose voice, as later developed, was launched from a
volcano through a large and carefully concealed megaphone against
an echoing canon-side.</p>

<p class="sup"><sup>2</sup> <i>Philippines Past and Present,</i> p.
944.</p>

<p>The Colorums of Surigao, however, are the special lot whose
doings were spread abroad, even to America, in the winter of
1923-4. And their creed, for all its whimsicality, gave rise to
rather serious concern. Their immediate leaders seem to have been a
handful of unknowns who appeared in the barrios some years back,
making themselves conspicuous by frequent church-going and much
profession of piety and spreading, the while, a curious fable.</p>

<p>War was coming, so ran their tale. War all over the Islands.
Surigao itself would see the first outbreak. Thence it would sweep
the archipelago. Up from the south the Moros would swarm. Down from
the mountains and over from Davao the wild men&mdash;the heathen
Manobos and Bogobos&mdash;would rush full-armed. And all would join
the Surigao Colorums in a general onslaught upon the Government.
Together they must kill every government official&mdash;every
&quot;traitor&quot; who refused to join their army.</p>

&quot;TELL AMERICA&quot;<br>
M. M. Newell<br></p>

<p>Then, after four months of fighting, Dr. Jos&eacute;
Rizal<sup>3</sup> would arrive at the barrio of Socorro, on the
Island of Bucos Grande off the coast of Surigao. He would appear in
a large ship. In this ship he would embark all the faithful and
would carry them triumphantly away to the Island of Ceb&uacute;.
There they would celebrate victory in company with the Holy
Child.</p>

<p class="sup"><sup>3</sup> Executed by Spain in 1896.</p>

<p>During these festivities a plague would break out and sweep the
earth clear of all who had survived the war yet who had refused to
join the Colorum forces. The property of the dead would then be
divided among the faithful and Dr. Jos&eacute; Rizal would be
crowned king. Every one would live happy forever after without
paying taxes and without necessity for work.</p>

<p>And that was all&mdash;excepting one small detail: Before the
war there would be necessity for money. The leaders would need
money in order that all things might be prepared.</p>

<p>A Filipino of many aliases, whose name averages
&quot;Lan-tayag,&quot; had for many years been locally operating
this device. Often arrested and imprisoned as a swindler, he still
returned to his chosen pursuit. And each reappearance counted, it
seems, as a new recrudescence of Dr. Jos&eacute; Rizal.</p>

<p>In his capacity of leader, Lantayag had many practical
inspirations&mdash;as for example that of collecting money to build
the very big ship that was to ferry the faithful from Socorro to
Ceb&uacute;. Or again, he received revelation that the world was
lying aslant&mdash;was tipping over&mdash;inevitably must tip over
and spill itself and all the faithful with it straight down into
the sea unless something was done to prevent.</p>

<p>Happily, revelation showed not the danger alone but also the
cure:</p>

<p>An immense amount of the very best hemp rope must be provided,
to lash the world fast. And, naturally, it must be the task of the
faithful to grow that hemp.</p>

<p>So all the Colorums grew hemp like mad. From dark to dark they
worked, cultivating wide areas that had never known the plough.
They produced such volumes of hemp&mdash;the very best
hemp&mdash;as had not been seen before. And, as each crop was
ready, they ran with it and pushed it into the hands of Dr.
Jos&eacute; Rizal and his lieutenants; then dashed back,
breathless, to grow more hemp and yet more, and more.</p>

<p>And it is entirely characteristic not of the simple Colorums
alone but of the Filipino people as a whole that, in all this
business, they appear never to have inquired as to the literal
disposition of their product&mdash;never to have asked where the
rope was made, or just who was attending to the job of lashing down
the world, or just what was his method of procedure.</p>

<p>The hemp-growing industry was but one among many money-making
devices. Another was a revelation that, during or after the war,
all streams would dry up and all &quot;traitors&quot; would be cut
off from good water. Therefore, revelation continued, the faithful
must build a great water-tank in the barrio of Socorro, on the
Island of Bucos Grande. And, in order to expedite all things (the
hour being at hand) they should go quickly and sell their houses
and their lands, wherever such might be, and repair to Bucos
Grande&mdash;to Socorro, <i>not forgetting to bring the sales-money
with them.</i></p>

<p>Obediently, the people uprooted themselves. Colorums all over
Surigao sold out their belongings to their &quot;traitor&quot;
neighbours at the best bargains they could drive and embarked for
the place of tryst.</p>

<p>Lantayag&mdash;&quot;Dr. Jos&eacute; Rizal&quot;&mdash;sat in
Socorro already installed. Daily he added to his fame by the
working of mysteries&mdash;such mysteries as are worked by the
planting in the ante-room of an agent who carries the easily-won
confidences of the waiting dupe to the seer behind the scene. Even
the wild men&mdash;Bogobos, Manobos&mdash;began coming down from
their hills when Colorum agents stole among them spreading their
news:</p>

<p>&quot;If you go to Socorro, to Dr. Jos&eacute; Rizal&mdash;and
have enough money with you&mdash;<i>he&#39;ll make you see your
dead!&quot;</i></p>

<p>Further, so Dr. Jos&eacute; Rizal informed his people, entirely
to their satisfaction, Socorro was the Eternal City, and would
never be destroyed. To the rest of the world, however, Socorro
seemed merely the usual little mess of twenty-odd grass shacks
squatting on the beach between the two horns of a crescent of
cocoanut palms.</p>

<p>Its normal population numbered about 250 souls, all told. But
now, with the influx of the faithful, several hundred fighting men
lay in the place. Already they had built the Great Tank, against
the Great Draught. Already the Tank was filled with the Waters of
Jordan, that cured all diseases of those who bathed therein and
drank therefrom. Already they had planted sweet potatoes and
fruits. Already, labouring rapidly, they had transported all their
pigs and chickens and cattle to the scene.</p>

<p>In a word, from the point of view of their simple
&quot;traitor&quot; compatriots, they were a formidable body
formidably intrenched for siege or sortie.</p>

<p>And their existence in that shape worked much hardship in the
whole Province.</p>

<p>On account of them the people everywhere, for mutual protection,
had deserted their farms to huddle together in the little coast
towns. Some, out of fear, actually became Colorums
themselves&mdash;from no sort of conviction, but simply in order
not to be objects of wrath when the War should begin. From the sea
straight up to the hilltops not a shack remained occupied, while in
the coast barrios dense overcrowding threatened pestilence. Terror
reigned while the crops went waste. And day by day, spread by
agents sent out from Socorro, the rumour grew that War was about to
break.</p>

<p>It was under these circumstances that Captain Juan, of the
Philippine Constabulary, felt it his duty to take a hand. Was not
&quot;Dr. Jos&eacute; Rizal&quot; swindling the people, paralyzing
the people, producing conditions that meant for the people certain
famine and plague?</p>

<p>Therefore it appeared to Captain Juan that he should go to
Socorro, find Dr. Jos&eacute; Rizal, and pull him out of his snug
nest, once more to give an account of himself before a magistrate
as a prisoner in court.</p>

<p>So Captain Juan, with a detail of Constabulary officers and men,
Filipinos all, set sail for Socorro.</p>

<p>But Lantayag&#39;s underground intelligence sped the news
through in advance, and when Juan arrived the rascal was nowhere to
be found.</p>

<p>Then Captain Juan, not to be entirely balked, conceived the idea
of destroying the Great Tank and letting the Waters of Jordan leak
away. This action recommended itself for three reasons: First, the
tank&#39;s existence was one of the great inducements that led the
people to leave their homes all over Surigao and to beggar
themselves, giving their all to a cheat. Second, the water was a
menace of pestilence&mdash;a compound of innumerable infections, to
which more were constantly added by the bathings of the sick. And,
third, the destruction of the Tank, divine appendage of the
Indestructible City, might help bring reason to the land.</p>

<p>So Captain Juan destroyed the Great Tank.</p>

<p>At this&mdash;as afterward appeared&mdash;Dr. Jos&eacute; Rizal
slipped off from his jungle hiding place and sailed away to the
island of liohol, whence, in his wrath, he sent back secret
messages that the day had come at last&mdash;<i>-the</i> day of the
Great War.</p>

<p>And&mdash;because government authorities in various parts of
Surigao had several times sentenced him to terms in jail&mdash;he
decreed that the War must begin with his revenge&mdash;must begin
with the killing of all Governmental authorities.</p>

<p>In blind obedience, the Colorums prepared to make good. They
possessed a few rifles and revolvers and&mdash;more
important&mdash;were absolutely confident of their own
invincibility and invulnerability against the arms of others. For
Dr. Jos&eacute; Rizal had taught them how to fight.</p>

<p>First and most vital of all&mdash;so ran his rules&mdash;each
man must be provided with an <i>anting-anting,</i> or amulet,
consisting of a little bottle containing cocoanut oil and human
bones&mdash;preferably a baby&#39;s kneecap. With this oil the
faithful must cross themselves on forehead, chin and breast,
keeping the bottle on their persons. Then, in Socorro, they were to
dig trenches in a demi-lune, entirely enclosing their landing-beach
in front of the village&mdash;trenches in which they could stand
concealed up to their necks. The two ends should be held by bolo
men. The centre by the men with guns. When Constabulary soldiers
disembarked on the beach the gunmen were to open fire and retreat.
As the constabulary pursued, the invisible bolo men at the two ends
of the demi-lune were to unite and surround the enemy.</p>

<p>But the bolo men must attack with their knife-arms flung across
their eyes and their eyes closed. And no one must shout or turn his
head or cry out.</p>

<p>And above all no one must say
&quot;<i>&#39;s&uacute;s-Maria-Jos&eacute;!&quot;</i></p>

<p>If all these things were properly done, then, said Dr.
Jos&eacute; Rizal, not a bullet could harm a Colorum. Each bullet,
as it struck their bodies, would turn to water or to a paper
wad.</p>

<p>But if any one shouted, or if any one yielded to impulse and
called&mdash;even in a whisper&mdash;on
&quot;&#39;s&uacute;s-Mar&iacute;a-Jos&eacute;&quot; then the
anting-anting would lose all its powers of protection.</p>

<p>The rest of the episode was sad enough. To try to tell it in
space here available would be to reduce a most picturesque drama to
a dry r&eacute;sum&eacute;. But it lasted for over a month, and had
then reached only a dubious and temporary settlement. It cost the
life of Captain Juan and a considerable number of the Philippine
Constabulary, officers and men. It carried off a much more
considerable number of the Colorums, who fought with
fury&mdash;especially after they were told that the death that
bullets seemed to inflict was, in their case, only an illusion; and
that, after some days, all the seeming dead would rise and go on
living again.</p>

<p>Dr. Jos&eacute; Rizal during all this unpleasantness kept
himself safely out of the way, in the distant island of Samar. And
the Holy Child, a wealthy middle-aged business man of Ceb&uacute;,
remained safe in his own home where, because of his riches and his
many good houses, no one would declare against him. But poor old
John the Baptist was killed in the fight at Socorro, and
Simeon&mdash;he who helped bear the Cross up Calvary &mdash;was
made prisoner in the same affray.</p>

<p>Incidentally, that Constabulary campaign, up to the time when
Colonel Bowers, a very efficient officer of the old American stock,
went down and took it in hand, once more illustrated this general
fact:</p>

<p>The bravery of a Filipino officer may be and often is of a high
order. But his judgment, coolness and nerve are not wholly to be
depended upon in sudden emergencies when the full responsibility
rests upon his head. And the action and morale of his men reflect
this limitation.</p>

<p>As has earlier been said, no middle class exists among the
Filipino people. For this reason the story of the Colorums is, in
its way, representative. The sect is spread all over the Islands.
And the great mass of the Christian Filipinos are of the mental
character to accept such a belief, or any other fantastic belief
that may be presented to them. Blessed Virgins, Popes and other
holy personages spring up every year, here and there, announce
their cures and cults and get their blind following. Nothing is
incredible to the untaught child mind. And between this mind and
the mind of the &quot;ilustrado&quot;&mdash;the person esteemed to
be of high education&mdash;no medium exists.</p>

<p>The Protestants in the Islands are reckoned to number about
200,000. A schism from Catholicism known as the Agli-payan Church
claims something over a million and a half members and appears to
be growing. The great mass of the Christian Filipinos, however,
still belong to the Church of Rome.</p>

<p>Of these it may be generalized that the women are devout, but
that the men of the upper class, with notable exceptions, are wont
to give voice to slight esteem for their church. But a feeling
remains that the hour of danger or death might uncover in the
scoffers another attitude.</p>

<p>Of American missions, the Evangelical representatives, as a
rule, are pursuing their work in the Roman Catholic field. The
Protestant Episcopal Church, on the contrary, has aimed to avoid
that field, confining itself, aside from its own people in the
American and British contingents, to the non-Christian
elements&mdash;as, for example, the hill-tribes of Luzon, the
pagans and the Mohammedans. Among the Mohammedans, however, it does
no proselyting whatever, confining itself entirely to educational
and social betterment.</p>

<p>The Y.M.C.A., finally, is doing an essential non-sectarian
social work for Filipinos, for the Chinese, and for Americans and
Europeans, all of whom appreciate its service.</p>

<p>The particular debt of the Filipinos to Elwood Brown, for years
physical director of the Y.M.C.A. in the Islands, was warmly
recognized on the occasion of Mr. Brown&#39;s sudden death in
America in 1924. When the news came over, the Filipino press as a
whole, without grudging and without qualification, put aside
anti-Americanism for the moment to acknowledge and praise a true
friend&#39;s great personal contribution to the whole people&#39;s
welfare.</p>

<h2>Chapter XVIII &mdash; HABITS THEY HAVE</h2>

<p>One of the most difficult, one of the most necessary, points in
thinking of the Filipino is to remember quite clearly and all the
time that, whatever his individual training and gifts, he is not a
dark-skinned white man but a Malay; and to realize further, that
the fact implies an historic and psychological background as
different from those of the white man as this world can show. To
fail in this realization is to become unjust.</p>

<p>A day or so before I left Manila an American came to see me
bringing his soul in his eyes. &quot;You are going to write about
these people,&quot; he said. &quot;Well, I have come to entreat you
to look for their virtues and to dwell upon those. Your book will
be far more useful if you take that course rather than one of
criticism.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Go on,&quot; said I&mdash;for the man is known for his
years of devotion to the people&#39;s service&mdash;&quot;give me,
yourself, the virtues of the Filipino. I will write down your exact
words.&quot;</p>

<p>With a rush he began: &quot;He is very hospitable. He is
courteous and well-mannered. He is good to his wife, indulgent to
his children. He loves music. He does not drink to excess. He talks
well. He has a fine memory. He...&quot;</p>

<p>Silence. Continued silence.</p>

<p>I looked up, my pencil suspended over my book.</p>

<p>&quot;Well?&quot; I asked.</p>

<p>But the man was leaning forward in his chair, clutching its two
arms so hard that his knuckles blanched, while he peered into space
with the strained, incredulous look of one confronted with a
ghost.</p>

<p>&quot;My God!&quot; he burst out at last in a sort of shrill
whisper &mdash;&quot;and <i>I&#39;ve</i> got to <i>live</i> among
these people!...&quot;</p>

<p>But he was making the mistake, in that moment, of judging by the
white man&#39;s code.</p>

<p>As one old-timer puts it, &quot;To the Filipino an
&#39;honourable man&#39; may commit fifty-seven varieties of crime,
as we see crime, without tarnishing his name. &#39;Honour,&#39;
&#39;Self-Control,&#39; &#39;Liberty,&#39; are words that to the
Malay and the Anglo-Saxon mean entirely different things.&quot;</p>

<p>Le Bon, in his <i>Psychology of Peoples,<sup>1</sup></i>
says:</p>

<p class="sup"><sup>1</sup> <i>The Psychology of Peoples,</i>
Gustave Le Bon, London, 1898, pp. 33-4.</p>

<blockquote>The character of a people and not its intelligence
determines its historical evolution and governs its destiny...The
influence of character is sovereign in the life of peoples, whereas
that of the intelligence is in truth very feeble. The Romans of the
decadence possessed an intelligence far more refined than that of
their rude ancestors, but they had lost the qualities of character
of the latter; the perseverance, the energy, ... the capacity to
sacrifice to an ideal...</blockquote>

<p>On just these two points&mdash;character and idealism&mdash;I
have before me the statement of a man whose deep sympathy for the
people of the Philippines is proved by his whole active life.
Himself of high character, idealism, humanity and
intelligence&mdash;a distinguished citizen of the world, his one
flaw as a witness lies in the fact that his name must be withheld.
He says:</p>

<p>&quot;These people have no character, and no consciousness of
what truth and honour mean. Their old religion has been taken away.
Nothing has been put in its place. They have nothing to build
character on. And you cannot properly call them &#39;immoral,&#39;
for they have no moral idea at all. It is not in them.
&#39;Idealism&#39; is the quality that they, incessantly, in season
and out of season, claim for themselves. What do they mean by
&#39;idealism&#39;?&mdash;If they mean having a head filled with
idle clouds of half-formed ideas&mdash;shapeless, useless notions
without vitality or real purpose&mdash;childish, high-sounding, but
without thought or actual intention&mdash;then these people are
idealistic, yes. But if idealism means a quality of mind through
which a man will constructively labour toward the good, on
principle, because it is good, and not for personal reward; if it
means serving others unselfishly, then there is not one idealist
among these people.&quot;</p>

<p>It should be explained of this testimony that it was tacitly
meant to concern the upper-class Filipino&mdash;the mestizo,
cacique class&mdash;with whom the speaker&#39;s special intimacy
exists.</p>

<p>To it he added:</p>

<p>&quot;Any man who sets out to help them help themselves, in
whatever direction, will soon be driven to recognize two primary
facts. First: that the one great fundamental is to build character.
Second: that the sole motive that will influence the Filipino is
vanity. Simply vanity. So surely vanity that the wise course is to
recognize it and use it as a tool to beguile him to better
things.</p>

<p>&quot;And yet&mdash;they have some way of winding themselves
around your heart. They are a most lovable people!&quot;</p>

<p><i>El Debate,</i> one of the best-known Manila newspapers, said
editorially, early in January, 1924:</p>

<blockquote>It is sad to confess that vanity among us occupies a
pre-eminent place, especially if an occasion affords for
&quot;showing off.&quot; For the few examples of generosity shown
in the erection of school edifices and other public buildings, we
have in exchange the glaring example of liberal contributions for
the election of a queen, a goddess, or a star, in a carnival or
other festival. Twelve thousand pesos were recently spent to have a
beauty sit in a seat of momentary duration.</blockquote>

<p>The educated Filipino&mdash;the
&quot;ilustrado&quot;&mdash;continually says of himself that he is
&quot;sensitive&quot; and &quot;proud.&quot;</p>

<p>If pride be described as man&#39;s concern about his opinion of
himself, while vanity is his concern about others&#39; opinion of
him; if pride is based on actual possession of qualities desired
while vanity aches merely to be thought to possess them,&mdash;then
it is vanity, not pride, that distinguishes the Filipino.</p>

<p>Many concrete misfortunes may befall him&mdash;many clippings of
plumage and tyings of hands and yet the burden may be lightly
carried if he has not been made to &quot;lose face.&quot;</p>

<p>He may be caught in depths of mendacity and
double-dealing&mdash;may be discovered in situations that, to a
white man, would mean the depths of shame;&mdash;yet, by his code,
no shame lies in it unless the matter be so handled as to hurt his
<i>&quot;amor proprio&quot;&mdash;</i>his self-love.</p>

<p>A judge of the Court says:</p>

<p>&quot;A politico recently asked the Governor-General to appoint
him to the Legislature, to one of the few seats filled by Executive
choice. In making his request, he informed His Excellency that he,
the applicant, was a friend of mine and had been under my orders
for many years. The Governor-General referred the statement to me
for confirmation.</p>

<p>&quot;&#39;Yes,&#39; I replied. &#39;This man was certainly
under my orders when I made him return 440 pesos to a poor Igorot
whom he had grossly defrauded. And again, twice again, he was under
my orders, when I sentenced him to terms in Bilibid prison.&#39;
&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Another politico came straight to me to ask me to
recommend him to the Governor-General for a place of honour and
trust. And yet I had sentenced him, also, twice over, to terms in
Bilibid. I cite these incidents to show that their standard of
honour is not ours; that from our point of view they have no sense
of responsibility or of shame, nor any conception of what we mean
by the terms. I do not blame them; it is in the logic of their
history&mdash;I merely state the fact.&quot;</p>

<p>Educators of all grades, up to the highest, state that Filipino
students as a matter of course attempt to cheat in ex-animations.
To make the attempt to cheat and to be caught in the act means no
shame. The thing that counts is the securing of the diploma no
matter by what method. But to see the trait set down in print, from
an American press, will certainly gall that <i>amor proprio.</i>
Not because of pricking conscience, but simply because some hint of
inferiority will be felt to be implied.</p>

<p>In the matter of B.A.&#39;s, M.A.&#39;s, Ph.D.&#39;s and the
rest, the stranger is often amazed and perplexed by the number and
variety of such trophies claimed by a single very young Filipino,
male or female, since among the white races only a prodigy of
intelligence could have learned so much in so short a lifetime.
Leaving Filipino-conferred degrees out of the question, American
institutions of learning are not a little blamed in this matter by
Americans long at work in the Islands. The ultimate interest of the
student, they say, is poorly served by too liberal overseas
friends.</p>

<p>On this point one of the first and most experienced of the
educators gave the following opinion&mdash;an opinion the more
valuable since many of his confr&egrave;res expressed similar
views.</p>

<p>&quot;Our young Filipino &#39;pensionados,&#39; sent to America
by Government funds for their education, actually suffer in the
long run from the American spirit of fair play that goes beyond
fairness. Seeing them eagerly doing their best, and, in view of
their background, admiring their effort, this spirit gives them
credit beyond their deserts, puts half-earned rewards in their way,
and sends them home with very serious cases of &#39;swelled
head,&#39; much crippled for usefulness to their own people.</p>

<p>&quot;As students they actually are cleverer than the average
Anglo-Saxon, in the sense that they grasp theories more quickly.
The reason is that, as a race, our judgment is much more developed
than theirs. There is nothing in their minds that requires to be
convinced, but only an all-receptive blank, on which an eager,
childlike memory prints formulse and phrases. Thus with facility
and speed they acquire a superficial appearance of capacity.</p>

<p>&quot;But in subjects such as political economics&mdash;subjects
where book-knowledge must be turned to the sound and accurate
reasoning-out, in new fields, of cause and effect and to the making
of original working deductions therefrom&mdash;the Filipino,
however long the battery of letters after his name, manifests
extreme incapacity.</p>

<p>&quot;He will make a learned and facile speech. He will write a
high-sounding treatise, deft in the use of technical terms and
well-calculated to impress a reader unfamiliar with the facts. But
the facts themselves he has but dimly perceived and has never
understood in their broad and comparative meanings. Illustrations
of this will be found in articles by Filipino authors on the
subject of the Government business enterprises contributed from
time to time to the American press.</p>

<p>&quot;In an academic test the Filipino student may very probably
carry off the highest honours in a class of many
nationalities&mdash;as, indeed, he recently has done in Johns
Hopkins. But thus far it has been exceedingly rare to find him
successfully applying his theoretic knowledge to the solving of
material problems not specifically described on the pages of his
school text-book. As a field man, in practice, he comes to a
standstill, a stranger to the tools in his hand, unless some
competent director is over him to tell him in detail what to do,
and, more particularly, to see that he does it. Field work of all
sorts falters, dies and lies unburied, shrouded in documents
embroidered in fine words, when its direction is left to native
heads alone.&quot;</p>

<p>To the Filipino public, a college degree is like an
<i>anting-anting</i> to a Colorum. Its mere possession is expected
to act as a push-button to the impossible.</p>

<p>In America, the highest degree from the best agricultural
college wins for its owner no more than a trial at any farmer&#39;s
hands. The cleverest graduate, unless his background be one of long
practical experience, must serve his apprenticeship as common
labourer, and be watched and tested therein before the farmer will
risk him in any foreman&#39;s job in charge of stock or crops.</p>

<p>Among the Filipinos, however, the mere possession of a Cornell
or a Wisconsin diploma is held to qualify a man for departmental
administration. And nothing in the result discredits our American
caution.</p>

<p>At a Y.M.C.A. student conference, held in Baguio in the winter
of 1923-1924, Governor-General Wood addressed the meeting. Toward
the end of his speech he emphasized the need of filling all
government places by the standard of merit alone. &quot;We want,
everywhere, the men best qualified to render the best public
service,&quot; said he.</p>

<p>Then he made his adieux.</p>

<p>One of the most active pol&iacute;ticos, Mr. Camilo Osias,
president of a private political training camp called the National
University,<sup>2</sup> escorted His Excellency from the room. It
is reported that when, a few minutes later, Mr. Osias returned, he
took the audience into his confidence as to what had happened
without.</p>

<p class="sup"><sup>2</sup> Not to be confused with the University
of the Philippines.</p>

<p>&quot;You agree with me, Osias, don&#39;t you?&quot; he quoted
the General as saying. &quot;You believe that we want the best men
we can get, no matter who they are? The country&#39;s work comes
first, before friendships or party.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You agree that we don&#39;t want Ph.D.&#39;s as such? We
want the best men.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Mr. Osias. &quot;Yes&mdash;and we
don&#39;t want any American B.A. put over a Ph.D.
Filipino.&quot;</p>

<p>From the audience great applause, Mr. Osias had, by his own
implication, defended his country&#39;s honour against an enemy,
and had come off triumphant, with the last word.</p>

<p>But, in the midst of the applause, another Filipino sprang to
his feet demanding a hearing. His name was Roasa.</p>

<p>&quot;You&#39;re not fair, Osias,&quot; he called out. &quot;You
tell your own story and stop where it suits you. You don&#39;t tell
what the Governor-General said in reply. He answered you squarely
and considerately and kindly, and what he said was this:</p>

<p>&quot;With a little care and diplomacy, Osias, that situation
can be avoided.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;An incident like this,&quot; said its narrator,
&quot;gives the utmost comfort and encouragement to us who are
working for the Filipinos. Many of them have courage enough to
follow strong leaders anywhere. But very few have the moral courage
to stand up and oppose their friends.&quot;</p>

<p>Moral standards of any sort are commonly the fruit of old
inheritance borne up on supports of public opinion.</p>

<p>When their only sources of knowledge have been full of pictures
of morals as primitive as those of Greek mythology, where should
the people have learned another standard? The churches deplore
moral breaches, but little actual loss of public credit appears to
follow the most flagrant of these. Or, if notice be taken of them,
it is rather for political convenience.</p>

<p>The facts on this general subject, as reached through
authoritative channels, are scarcely printable in any book for
general readers. One thing, however, must be given voice. It is the
protest of a most devoted physician, now well on in a second decade
of continuous medical and surgical service in the Islands. For
obvious and imperative reasons this physician may not be named. To
do so would be to end abruptly a career of the utmost usefulness.
But the claim of almost a score of years of scientific life-saving
service freely rendered to the Filipino people in the name of
merciful America commands the most attentive and respectful hearing
from the American public.</p>

<p>This physician has earnestly requested to be thus quoted to the
people at home:</p>

<p>&quot;We cannot build on a foundation of degradation and filth.
We have done a costly wrong, both to ourselves and to the Filipino
people, in telling them always how fine they are&mdash;in
proclaiming always their remarkable advance in so short a period as
a quarter century&mdash;in uniting in a conspiracy of silence as to
their faults. Making all allowances for natural differences in the
nature of races, there are some things that we cannot condone if we
accept any commitment from our own Christianity. One of these is
the abuse of children. The youngest victim of rape for whom I have
had to care&mdash;and she terribly torn and infected&mdash;was
three weeks old. Those of six months or a year&mdash;of two, four,
five years&mdash;are very common. Fathers and brothers are often
the offenders. The children of girls of twelve or fourteen not
seldom belong to their own brothers, fathers or uncles. The
victimization of little school-girls by their school teachers as
the price of passing examinations is, in the provinces, almost a
matter of course. And in any of these cases little or no public
interest is felt&mdash;no reprobation. Between the top and the
bottom of the social ladder there is often little to choose. Of
course honourable exceptions exist. But we, in our well-meant
flattery, have made it a habit to talk only of those exceptions. To
tell the plain, straightforward truth would be the truest kindness,
and would undeceive Christian people at home who think
America&#39;s duty to the Filipino is almost completed.&quot;</p>

<p>The position of the Filipino woman is in many ways good. Except
where poverty compels, she is rarely a drudge. Many women are
practicing lawyers, doctors or dentists. Among the
<i>ilustrados,</i> the married woman quite commonly holds some
paying position, as librarian, teacher, secretary, which she
pursues in addition to her household cares; yet not to the neglect
thereof. She handles and sells the crops, where such are owned. She
is the household business head, frugal and thrifty in management.
She holds the household purse, disburses as she sees fit, and
carries the keys. More than that, the husband rarely embarks upon
any new enterprise, makes any important purchase or sale, or
undertakes any sort of business without first asking his wife&#39;s
opinion, by which he usually abides. The attitude of Diego Tecson,
shown in an earlier chapter, furnishes an example true to form.</p>

<p>In a roomful of University-trained Filipino women of the cacique
class, I once raised this point.</p>

<p>&quot;Is it true/&#39; I asked, &quot;that you are the business
heads of the household&mdash;that you receive from your husbands
their salaries or incomes and expend them according to your own
judgment? That if, for example, a house is to be bought or rented
or built or repaired, it is the wife who sees to it, not the
husband?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Certainly it is true,&quot; they all replied.</p>

<p>&quot;Do you mean it literally?&quot; I pursued.</p>

<p>&quot;Certainly,&quot; they repeated. And then, as if puzzled by
the unsatisfied insistence of the question, one of them added:</p>

<p>&quot;We should think it very undignified of our husbands if
they engaged in such matters&mdash;mere business.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What, then, are the proper pursuits for men?&quot; I
asked.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, <i>politics,&quot;</i> came the quick reply. To which
all the room heartily assented.</p>

<p>The women, it is generally held, show, on an average, stronger
moral natures, greater moral courage and more stability of
character than the men, constituting the sounder element of the
population. Their bearing is modest, refined, graceful and
attractive. They have pretty social accomplishments. They are
devoted mothers, and, although in the care of their young children
they are perhaps more indulgent than discreet, they go to endless
sacrifices to secure what they hold to be the proper education of
those that survive to later years.</p>

<p>Governor-General Wood, who has taken every opportunity to
express his admiration for the sterling qualities of the Filipino
women, has never ceased to urge their men to grant them the
suffrage. Every bill that has reached the Legislature, on this
errand, has, however, been quietly tabled. In his Annual Message to
the Philippine Legislature of 1922, General Wood gave the most
telling place in the document to this paragraph:</p>

<blockquote>There is one final recommendation to which I earnestly
invite your favourable consideration, and that is the extension of
the suffrage to the women of the Philippine Islands under the same
conditions and to the same extent that you have extended it to the
men. Such action will tend to build up and greatly extend
enlightened public opinion, to raise the standards of public and
private morality, to increase interest in public affairs, and
greatly to improve the efficiency of the Government; in a word it
will tend to the advancement and betterment of the people of the
Philippine Islands.</blockquote>

<p>Again, in his Message of 1923, Governor-General Wood urgently
repeated his plea for the women. And in his Report to the Secretary
of War, dated December 31, 1922, he said:</p>

<blockquote>One of the strongest influences for building up
interest in proper municipal and provincial government comes from
the numerous women&#39;s clubs. They have done excellent work,
especially in behalf of child welfare, public health, public
instruction, private and public morality and in the stimulating of
interest in local government&mdash;municipal and provincial...I am
convinced that the extension of suffrage to women...will be to the
advantage of the people of the Philippine Islands.</blockquote>

<p>Governor-General Wood&#39;s subsequent annual messages have
continued to advocate the measure which, however, elicits faint
interest from the pol&iacute;ticos.</p>

<p>The public work actually accomplished by Filipino women is
notable in comparison to the past, however, rather than for its
actual present volume. But it makes a hopeful beginning on a huge
task waiting to be done.</p>

<h2>Chapter XIX &mdash; THE DEVIL TAKES THE HINDMOST</h2>

<p>&quot;THE Filipino&quot;&mdash;so says one of the wisest of
them&mdash;&quot;loves dress and luxuries. If he has not a
Rolls-Royce it is only because he has not yet scraped together the
price. Once he has it, then he wants extra nickel trimmings to
spread money upon. He wants the dearest and the showiest always. He
loves to entertain, and thinks it beneath his dignity to entertain
frugally. More than that, he must do it handsomely, and he will not
hesitate to plunge into debt for the purpose.</p>

<p>&quot;If he is a landlord and has a season of bumper crops, he
will bring his family to Manila, buy diamonds and strip his purse
bare, long before next harvest season. Then, to get goods to tide
him over the hungry space, he will go, not to a bank but to a
commission house. And, once he is on those books, his own habits
see to it that he plunges deeper and deeper and never goes free
again.&quot;</p>

<p>Captain J. Y. Mason Blunt, writes:<sup>1</sup></p>

<blockquote>The Filipino...is quite as fond of money as any
Caucasian, but has no appreciation of its value in the European or
American sense of the word. His idea is that it should be used
while he is able to enjoy it and not be hoarded until he is past
the age of doing so, leaving it for some one else to spend.
Consequently while young he will squander it...<br>
<br>
What Americans call &quot;the dignity of labour&quot; is
meaningless to him. He can see nothing to admire or respect in it
as an idea, because he considers work in itself merely an
inconvenience, to be avoided if possible.</blockquote>

<p class="sup"><sup>1</sup> <i>&gt;An Army Officer&#39;s Philippine
Studies,</i> Manila, 1912, p. 9.</p>

<p>And it is. this conception, nurtured by his Spanish inheritance,
that leads him to aim at the law or even at a picayune Government
clerkship, leaving agriculture, manufacture, engineering or any
sort of productive occupation in a sort of tacit disrepute.</p>

<p>Law peculiarly suits him. He feels a comfortable dignity in it.
In other directions he has little initiative, but in law his
sinuous mind, quick in subterfuges, expedients and traps, finds a
natural field. It is the inherited mind of the Oriental,
Latin-mingled, Latin-trained.</p>

<p>The study of forestry is offered by the Government in most
attractive form, but enjoys no popularity, although a good supply
of trained foresters must long continue to be one of the vital
needs of the Islands. Smacking of the soil, forestry lacks
distinction.</p>

<p>To quote a practical local authority:</p>

<blockquote>We had last year over three thousand young chaps who
were studying to become lawyers and only 200 odd who were studying
to become farmers. In other words the prospective parasites
outnumber the producers 15 to 1. And yet agriculture is and must
always be the one great mainstay of the Islands, with no second in
sight. We have only eleven or twelve hundred educated doctors among
eleven to twelve million people. But we have four times as many
lawyers as we can use, and their proportion grows yearly. The point
is, our people love to talk and argue. They love to
orate.</blockquote>

<p>Meantime, in many a provincial barrio home, the son, returned
from the University, lounges idly in the front window all day long,
his splendid presence there and his framed diploma on the wall
being reward enough for the old parents who have sacrificed much
for the honour of pointing to an &quot;ilustrado&quot;
offspring.</p>

<p>A young Filipino official now working hard to help his people
testifies:</p>

<p>&quot;The majority of aspirant lawyers who are sent from the
provinces to be educated are greeted with enthusiasm, when they
come back, by the people. They are given banquets and are looked
upon with pride and hope, as saviours to be. But instead of helping
the people of their home country and sharing with them what they
gained in Manila, they quickly become caciques, join a political
party and are exactly as bad as the old ones, preying on the poor.
The prevailing idea concerning the tao is that he exists by divine
Providence for the comfort of the city gambler. As far as we have
yet developed, education only results in further oppression of the
poor.&quot;</p>

<p>The man just quoted has exhibited much moral courage in his own
work day by day. And yet perhaps the most appealing proof of his
sincerity lies in the fact that when he sees a real rock
ahead&mdash;a real show-down&mdash;when he must either solidly
withstand some formidable politico or else fail utterly on his job,
he is wont to go to his American superior for help. &quot;Will you
please handle this case?&quot; he frankly begs. &quot;I am afraid
to attempt it, I can&#39;t count on myself, I might
yield.&quot;</p>

<p>Another illustration of the quality last indicated may be found
in the comparative influence of American and Filipino Health
officials:&mdash;A rich man in the city keeps a filthy backyard in
which wicked smells and mosquito breeding-holes abound. The
Filipino sanitary inspector goes in, sees the condition and
notifies the owner.</p>

<p>&quot;What do you mean!&quot; blusters the rich man.
&quot;Nonsense! My yard is perfectly clean.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why, of course it is!&quot; rejoins the inspector.
&quot;But you see, here is this brute of an <i>Americano,</i> my
chief. He will have these silly notions, and he forces us to carry
them out. It is our common misfortune, as slaves to foreigners. And
so, although your yard is beautifully neat, you will have to do the
foreigner&#39;s will.&quot;</p>

<p>So the owner cleans up and one more malaria risk is gone.</p>

<p>But, if the chief of the Health Work is a Filipino, another
answer meets the inspector&#39;s request.</p>

<p>&quot;Curse your impudence!&quot; shouts the cacique.
&quot;I&#39;ll see whether such things can be said to me!&quot; and
off he goes to the Chief Health Officer&#39;s office.</p>

<p>&quot;What do you mean by sending your whipper-snapper to tell
<i>me</i> to &#39;clean up&#39; my beautiful place?&quot; he
demands.</p>

<p>And the official, appalled and shocked at the unpleasantness of
the situation, hastens to apologize and to smooth it down.</p>

<p>&quot;Of course it was all a mistake!&quot; he repeats.
&quot;The man was quite wrong. I know that your yard must be in
perfect condition...&quot;</p>

<p>And so the smells and the mosquitoes remain undisturbed.</p>

<p>On general principles the Filipino dislikes the unsuave, and is
ever inclined, regardless of his personal knowledge or opinion, to
say the thing he thinks his interlocutor desires to hear.</p>

<p>The claim of kinship is very potent, often constituting a
generously recognized title to share, at need, in all a man has.
Ob-versely, it operates to becloud the sense of mine and thine in
the trustee of public or private funds, when a kinsman calls.</p>

<p>Another Filipino virtue&mdash;respect for age and
seniority&mdash;is so dominant as often to become a pitfall. A
young doctor, for example, will throw to the four winds all his
exact modern knowledge gained in some American medical school to
conform without protest to the opinion of an old practitioner whom
he knows to be fatally wrong. And this he does simply because the
old fellow is an old fellow and has been wrong such a long
time.</p>

<p>The Filipino daily, <i>El Debate,</i> laments the Filipino&#39;s
complete &quot;absence of the spirit of co-operation.&quot;
<sup>2</sup></p>

<p class="sup"><sup>2</sup> January 8 or 9, 1924.</p>

<p>The root of this trait lies apparent in the people&#39;s early
history. The original settlement of the original emigrants
permanently determined the general human type of a given locality
and the boundaries thus established have in all things
survived.</p>

<p>One of the most discerning of the University of the Philippines
faculty speaks of his students thus:</p>

<p>&quot;When they say &#39;Filipino&#39; they are not thinking of
all the tribes that carry the name. They are thinking only of their
own tribe. In the University, as in politics (and the University is
riddled with politics) it is therefore difficult to keep out
favouritism based on tribal affiliation. I have known an instructor
in this University to give two-thirds of his class a failing grade
because of their having said something in criticism of his, the
instructor&#39;s, tribe.</p>

<p>&quot;They were Tagalogs and Visayans. He was an Ilocano. They
did not want an Ilocano instructor. So they mocked him and he
flunked them.</p>

<p>&quot;Tagalogs and Visayans are greatly in the majority in the
University. Ordinarily they pull dead against each other, simply as
such, in everything, even in electing class officers. Occasionally
all the other tribes combined will amount to enough to force the
Tagalogs and the Visayans to hang together to keep the others out.
But the idea that they all could and should work as one, for the
common good, is to-day a concept utterly beyond them.&quot;</p>

<p>This trait is not an undergraduate&#39;s tradition, like our own
Freshman-Sophomore wars, but a definite characteristic of the
people. Many thoughtful Filipinos not committed to politics state
that in their opinion, tribal jealousies would prove too strong to
permit any common government, but for the controlling hand of some
foreign power.</p>

<p>This sense of individualism&mdash;of separateness&mdash;this
lack of fellowship and of responsibility, exists as a fundamental
down to the original unit. Patriotism, to the great majority of the
Filipinos, means, therefore, an effort for personal profit. Though
he will not admit the truth of this statement, and perhaps has not
analyzed his own mind so far, his deeds furnish consistent proof.
It is almost impossible for him to understand in his heart the
possibility of any man&#39;s or any nation&#39;s acting on a
disinterested motive. It is like trying to visualize a new primary
colour; he has no grounds for a start.</p>

<p>Education, to him, has ever meant just this one thing: a means
for escaping work&mdash;never a means to power for more and better
work. With this in view, it will be seen what curious confusions
are invited to his mind when we ingenuously spread before him our
own American school textbooks, without change and without
preparation for his utterly different needs. Interpreting our
national history by his own race experience, he innocently sets up
parallels where none exist.</p>

<p>The models for which our books invite his admiration are Abraham
Lincoln, Daniel Webster, Patrick Henry. In them he inevitably fixes
his eyes upon the material end attained&mdash;not upon preliminary
training. He looks, not upon the rail-splitter hewing a way through
hardship; not upon the bare-foot boy determined by endless effort
to wring his place from fate; not upon the patriot literally ready
to give his all to his country, but simply upon the President, the
orator, the public favourite. Simply upon the finished product,
whose side he would reach at one step&mdash;by acquiring a college
degree, no matter how.</p>

<p>Lincoln&mdash;Webster&mdash;Patrick Henry. Orators all. How
all-sufficient, then, the calling of Orator!</p>

<p>The typical Filipino suffers cruelly under ridicule. Sarcasm
means nothing to him, but ridicule kills. And yet his sense of the
ridiculous is weak. The solemnity and persistence with which he
commits himself to this practice and career of oratory&mdash;in
which, by the way, he excels&mdash;the eagerness with which, from
childhood&#39;s hour to ripe old age, he will listen to and admire
the other man if only the other man will listen to and admire
him&mdash;give proof enough of this.</p>

<p>And yet oratory, in the Philippines, is rather a sickness than a
joke. Oratory is a menace to the future nation.</p>

<p>Behind the dazzling cloud of rhetoric and for all his borrowed
robe of noble phrases&mdash;&quot;slogans&quot;&mdash;the man is
untouched still.</p>

<p>In a sudden storm of bitter self-dissection&mdash;of bitter
resentment against the nation whose blindness, as he said, had
driven him so far, one mestizo official declared himself thus:</p>

<p>&quot;You Americans do not know how to handle us. You take the
position that we are all brothers&mdash;you and we
together&mdash;we your equals. Whereas every one of us knows in his
heart that he is not. This puts us in a false position because you
ask too much of us. You ask too much of me. More than I can
fulfill. You talk about &#39;honour&#39; and &#39;truth&#39; and
&#39;golden rule&#39; and &#39;common decency.&#39; I can see what
you mean. But I feel no impulse responding in my own heart to those
words as you mean them. They are not a part of my mentality and
when you put me on my honour or leave things to what you call my
good faith unchecked, you cruelly and stupidly doom me to failure
and that is true of all of us. Remember, it is you, not we, who
said in the beginning that we are your equals. You perhaps try to
mean it, but we know it is not true. It is shallow self-righteous
cant. You don&#39;t know how to handle us&mdash;and you are very
hard on us, because of it.&quot;</p>

<p>The churches, though endeavouring to train native clergy, have
all found need to bring out men from home. In the Roman Church
young Jesuits of the best ability are now being imported from
America, and it is everywhere apparent that the native type, with
rare exceptions, cannot hold church work up. Oriental indifference
to suffering, Oriental indifference to the welfare of the masses,
Oriental lack of interest in or sense of responsibility for the
poor, the sick, the helpless, Oriental lack of initiative and of
self-control are the characteristics that produce this result.</p>

<p>Blunt cites a well-known double murder committed by the only
painter of note that the Philippines have produced.<sup>3</sup> The
artist, a member of the cacique class, killed his wife and her
mother in their apartment in Paris. &quot;While the tragedy was
going on,&quot; says Blunt, &quot;a son and brother of the victims
was calmly walking up and down a courtyard below, although he knew
his mother and sister were being killed. This displays the
strangely impassive side of the Filipino character.&quot;</p>

<p class="sup"><sup>3</sup> <i>An Army Officer&#39;s Philippine
Studies,</i> p. 13. See also <i>La Gazette des Tribunaux,</i>
Paris, February gth, 1893.</p>

<p>The French court that tried the case recognized extenuating
circumstances in the racial status of the criminal.</p>

<p>&quot;If a horse falls down in the street, you stand by and
laugh. If any one helps him up, it is an American. Do we call
ourselves a civilized people?&quot; Dean Bocobo of the College of
Law is quoted as saying to Manila audiences.</p>

<p>But not by a single exhortation, not by brief decades of
influence, can ancient viewpoints be transformed.</p>

<p>Here is a story&mdash;a common little story of to-day:</p>

<p>Up near the north-east boundary of the Province of Nueva Ecija
the new highway meets the mountains head-on. Meets and suddenly
attacks them, zigzagging up and sharp up till it emerges on the
&quot;height of land&quot; at Balete Pass. Gates bar the way at
intervals, for the road is too narrow to permit the passing of
vehicles in safety, and it takes good driving under the best of
conditions to make those perilous turns. So Gustave goes not up
till Alphonse is safely down.</p>

<p>One noonday, last March, I arrived at the top of Balete
southward bound. And the gate was down. Of the several Filipinos
who sat about the place one volunteered the information that an
automobile was mounting and should soon appear.</p>

<p>Meantime, glad of a chance to look about on foot, I left my car
and started to stroll down the <i>zigzag.</i> In two minutes the
sharp swing of the road had shut me completely away from humanity
into the unknown.</p>

<p>On the left the mountain rose almost straight, gloriously
timbered, threaded with little streams. To the right it dropped as
precipitously, where from the dizzy edge one looked down upon tiers
on tiers of enormous treetops. On I strolled, and still on, lured
always by the secret beyond the next grim shoulder of rock.</p>

<p>It was very still. The occasional fluting of a solitary bird
stood out like a silver thread upon dark velvet. Still and soft and
hot.</p>

<p>Yet not quite still.</p>

<p>From above on the mountain side, somewhere behind the forest
screen, came at intervals a rhythmic sound as of beating upon a
metallic instrument, mingled with chanting voices of men. Somewhere
up there, as I knew, live certain of the head-hunting people. Only
two months before, indeed&mdash;in January, 1924&mdash;a party of
Ilongot tribesmen, coming down from these same mountains, had taken
three heads in a place but a few miles distant from the spot where
I now stood.</p>

<p>The Ilongots beat metallic instruments and chant. And when they
take human heads it may be for mere purposes of record, without any
personal rancour at all. So that almost anybody&#39;s head might
do.</p>

<p>They have a special knife for the purpose, and they make no
noise. In fact, if it is your head that they desire, you will
probably never get knowledge of the fact unless the welcoming
angels subsequently inform you.</p>

<p>All these things I thought of, being several corners removed
from the gate at the top of the pass. And at first their
consideration brought a little tingle of excitement.</p>

<p>There, certainly, were the capable Ilongots close at hand. Here,
also, was I, with my head on. No witnesses about. And nothing more
was necessary.</p>

<p>For a moment or two I rather enjoyed the full flavour of the
thing. Then I climbed straight back up that zigzag very fast
indeed, having been gone, as I now suddenly realized, two and
three-quarters hours.</p>

<p>At the top my car still stood, of course. The gate was still
down. The station keepers still idled about. Three of them.</p>

<p>&quot;This gate has been down at least two and three quarters
hours,&quot; I said.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; they answered, &quot;longer.&quot;</p>

<p>They spoke fair English. Spruce young high-school Filipinos with
government jobs.</p>

<p>&quot;That,&quot; I pursued, &quot;means that a car is in
trouble somewhere between here and the next gate below.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Undoubtedly such must be true,&quot; they agreed, pleased
to converse.</p>

<p>&quot;A car in trouble for over two hours, and no one has gone
down to see what is wrong?&quot; I asked.</p>

<p>&quot;No. No one.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They may be in some difficulty that they can&#39;t handle
without help. They may stop the road forever, unless some one goes
to their aid.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why, yes, that may be.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Or,&quot; I went on, warming up to the subject, &quot;the
driver may be taken ill. Or the car may have gone over the side and
every one in it may be hurt or killed.&quot;</p>

<p>Politely they listened to my speculations, gathering in their
full numbers to do so. They were calm, and entirely detached. Not
in any way did they see a personal bearing in the theme. A
discourse on petrography would have stirred them as much.</p>

<p>Suddenly I turned from warm to very hot and boiled over in
sincere and open wrath.</p>

<p>&quot;How is it possible,&quot; I exclaimed, &quot;that
you&mdash;the whole lot of you, able-bodied educated young
men&mdash;can stay here dozing half the afternoon when you say,
yourselves, that people may lie bleeding and helpless just below.
You know that, and yet you never stir yourselves to find
out!&quot;</p>

<p>I stopped for breath, glaring the rage I felt. Then one of them
unlimbered his thought.</p>

<p>&quot;Madam,&quot; he said, &quot;it would be fine&mdash;very
fine indeed&mdash;if one of us were paid to go down the road, at
times like this, to see what is wrong. It would be very fine. But
nobody, you see, has that job.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; chimed the others, brightly, &quot;that&#39;s
just it. Nobody has that job.&quot;</p>

<h2>Chapter XX &mdash; WHAT THEY SAY OF US</h2>

<p>America&#39;s history in the Philippine Islands from the
beginning of the Civil Establishment until to-day naturally divides
itself into three periods&mdash;the Constructive, from 1900 to
1913, the Destructive, from 1913 to 1921, and the Reconstructive,
which, beginning as 1921 drew to its close, is still in
progress.</p>

<p>Of all three the last has been immeasurably the most
difficult&mdash;a condition largely bred by the thick cloud of
ignorance that on every side enshrouds the scene of action.</p>

<p>Dense as it is, American ignorance of Philippine affairs
scarcely, if at all, exceeds the ignorance of the Filipino people
in the same direction. And such an atmosphere cannot but create the
maximum of embarrassment to an American Executive in the
Islands.</p>

<p>&quot;I complain that America learns about Philippine affairs
only from American politicians, who get their information from
Filipino politicians. And politicians belong to no country, but are
a curse common to all, concerned with nothing, anywhere, but their
own personal advancement.&quot;</p>

<p>These are the words of a Filipino business man, a considerable
wholesale merchant&mdash;spoken in February, 1924, in Manila.</p>

<p>Carrying out his thought, I later asked an eminent Filipino
politician, a leader of the majority party:</p>

<p>&quot;Why does your envoy in Washington talk as he does in
testifying before our Congressional Committees? Those Committees
are serious bodies whose time is valuable to America. They pay that
young man the courtesy of respectful attention. And you and I
agree, in reading the records of the hearings, that he abuses
Congress&#39;s courtesy. His statements are often distortions and
worse, not of opinion but of fact. He will surely get caught one
day. And that cannot but be costly to those who give him his
head.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said my caller. &quot;I begin to fear so. The
trouble is, he is too young.&quot;</p>

<p>To ask a Filipino for an opinion on the work of the present
American Administration amounts to asking for an opinion on
Governor-General Wood, since the whole trend of the last two
r&eacute;gimes has hinged on the personalities of the two American
Executives.</p>

<p>Mr. Jos&eacute; Abad Santos is an able lawyer and an ex-member
of the Cabinet&mdash;one of those who resigned at &quot;the
Crisis.&quot; Up to that time as Attorney General and Secretary of
the Department of Justice he had been a useful and diligent member
of the Government. His statement runs:</p>

<p>&quot;Governor-General Wood, had he come in Mr. Taft&#39;s
place, would have been acceptable and probably successful. Neither
Mr. Taft nor any other American could succeed as Governor-General
now. We have progressed too far. We want autonomy.</p>

<p>&quot;The Jones Law is our Constitution. Governor Harrison&#39;s
principle was that under that law the Governor-General&#39;s
authority is confined to our foreign relations. In accordance with
this interpretation we passed a considerable number of laws
concerning our internal affairs.</p>

<p>&quot;These laws the Wood-Forbes report pointed out to the
President and Congress of the United States as laws that should be
repealed. The final power lying with Washington, we waited for
Washington&#39;s decision. Congress remained silent and has taken
no action. Mr. Harding&#39;s personal response was: &#39;We shall
take no backward step.&#39;</p>

<p>&quot;From these circumstances we have drawn the only deduction
possible&mdash;namely that Congress disapproves the findings of the
Wood-Forbes report and sustains our interpretation of the Jones
Law; and, further, that Mr. Harding was of like opinion.</p>

<p>&quot;Congress and the President are our court of last resort.
The question has been put squarely up to them, and they by silence
have rendered their negative decision on the recommendations of
General Wood.</p>

<p>&quot;The Jones Law, like most laws, is capable of more than one
interpretation. We and Governor-General Harrison agreed on our
interpretation. The United States Congress and the President, by
silence, sided with us. Now comes a new Governor-General and gives
us a new interpretation. &quot;We are now told by some Americans:
&quot;&#39;Ah, but this is a Republican Administration. Mr.
Harrison and Mr. Wilson were Democrats. Under another party you
must expect another policy.&#39;</p>

<p>&quot;Where does that leave us? Each time you in America change
parties, are we in the Philippines to expect a change of the laws
under which we live? Evidently this is literally the case. Is it
reasonable to think that we can ever consent to live under a
government that administers with so uncertain a hand?&quot;</p>

<p>My notes record a large number of such opinions, very few of
which may here be attributed to their sources by name. Each
statement now to follow comes, however, from a mestizo Filipino in
high standing in the cacique ranks, whether in public life or in
other fields. And each is chosen for the reason that it represents
the private expressions of a considerable class.</p>

<p>An eminent legal personage not in politics, a man of undoubted
sincerity, said to me, in March, 1924:</p>

<p>&quot;I consider the Jones Bill a measure for testing our
ability to run our international affairs without interference from
the Governor-General. The Wood-Forbes Commission went to the
records and found we had gone astray&mdash;that we had not done as
well as they hoped and expected. The Governor-General [Wood] has
not exceeded his power. He has been careful. He is accused of
abusing the veto:&mdash;We must remember that the veto power is
given for a reason&mdash;to check movement harmful either to the
Filipinos or to the United States. It has been used by General Wood
so often as to make the impression of arbitrariness. But many of
the laws proposed in the present legislature are proposed solely to
force the veto, so that the cry of tyranny may be raised.</p>

<p>&quot;Again, our political leaders accuse General Wood of spite
against the country in his action on the Bank and the Railroad. As
to the Bank, the action of the Governor-General was just and
considerate. As to the Manila Railroad, unfortunately the
impression was set going that the Governor-General sympathizes with
the great Interests in the United States and wants to further their
wishes here. It must be considered that, when we bought that
railway, it was not so much to make money as to control the
property. We were told that the royalty of England had interest in
the road and that England might therefore protest against our
independence. Mr. Harrison personally gave much currency to this
idea, and it was generally believed. I do not yet know the truth
about it.</p>

<p>&quot;The greatest trouble here is made by Americans themselves
&mdash;people in the United States who continually demand
investigations and removals. It may not hurt the object of the
attack in the United States, but it certainly hurts your
Governor-Generals here. And, far more than that, it very seriously
damages the prestige of the United States in the eyes of our
people.</p>

<p>&quot;No one can get far into our political atmosphere without
finding that we have lost our respect for the President of the
United States, not as a man, but as an authority. Whoever he is, he
is so soon gone that we always feel his weakness. Because his
successor hastens to overturn all that he did his promises or his
threats therefore mean little. Presidents seem not to dare to begin
to handle us, knowing that they cannot make good whatever ground
they take. And the same with Congress. At best we have lost our
respect for Congress too. American training does not produce the
kind of man we need here.</p>

<p>&quot;Your type does not want to waste time on the little
courtesies that in the Orient go a long way. But even Mr. Taft
would have been savagely attacked if he had come here instead of
General Wood. You Americans ought to understand that no
Governor-General coming here after Harrison could escape great
trouble if he tried to govern according to the law.</p>

<p>&quot;I was recently listening to two members of our Legislature
while they discussed the best means of getting rid of General Wood.
One advocated the method of nagging persecution, at present in use.
The other said:</p>

<p>&quot;&#39;We are making a stupid mistake. Let him rather have
his own way and never interfere with him. In that way he will
rapidly build up such a great name, here, by accomplished work,
that he will be the obvious man for the presidency of the United
States and will be called home for the campaign.&#39;</p>

<p>&quot;Governor-General Wood has made mistakes, but it would be a
fatal mistake to remove him. First, the prestige of the whole
American people in the Orient is involved. It will be very
seriously damaged if, in answer to the noise and scheming of our
pol&iacute;ticos, you withdraw him. It would only invite more
unrest. Our pol&iacute;ticos would get the idea that all they have
to do is to whistle and the head of any American falls.</p>

<p>&quot;And then, General Wood has only just now worked this
country&#39;s finances out of bankruptcy. It took great skill and
knowledge to do it. From now on, if Washington supports him as it
should, and if he continues his policy of non-aggressiveness, he
will be able to make a success of his administration. The worst is
past. After the Presidential election things will settle down so
that he will be able to do his best for the Philippines.</p>

<p>&quot;It is a very great mistake under any circumstances to
change Governor-Generals as America does. The English system is the
right one. Their men serve in a given country years and years
before they are entrusted with the governorship. They go into
office knowing both the people and the language. And then, mark
you, the British Government backs them.</p>

<p>&quot;You Americans are not good business men. You don&#39;t
understand that your Executive must be backed. You seem always
half-hearted&mdash;always afraid of taking any stand and sticking
to it. How can we respect you? Your weakness injures and revolts
us.</p>

<p>&quot;If you could only have the English way. They know how to
handle us!&quot;</p>

<p>The man who speaks next is a mestizo merchant of the best
standing, of large means and of an unusual knowledge of the world
beyond the archipelago.</p>

<p>&quot;As to the Governor-General, I believe he came out in the
best faith to do his best for the Filipinos. He may possibly have
acted against the Jones Law, for the Jones Law is not clear. Where
the law is clear, then Governor-General Wood has followed it. Where
it is not clear he has chosen the interpretation best for the
people&#39;s need. He may have been right or he may have been
wrong, as far as the inward intention of the law is concerned. But,
in any case, his interpretation of the law is for the good of the
people. In his place I would do as he has done. He may have made
mistakes, but I think his judgment has been sound and good. I think
his purpose has always been so.&quot;</p>

<p>Now follows a prominent lawyer, an active member of the
opposition, a man generally respected:</p>

<p>&quot;I do not like it to be thought that the Filipinos are
unap-preciative of what the United States has done for them. They
are not. But up to Harrison we had little or no political
experience. Then came Harrison and, apparently by instruction,
threw everything suddenly into Filipino hands. It was extremely
unfair. We were entirely unprepared, and naturally disgraced
ourselves. Then came Governor-General Wood, who has tried to steer
a middle course, and who is, in consequence, decried by the
Americans here as too soft, and by the Filipinos&mdash;in public
speech&mdash;as the opposite. The accusation that the
Governor-General had abused the veto is very loud and wholly false.
Every one of his vetoes has been necessary.&quot;</p>

<p>One of the University faculty, a man prominent among the
majority pol&iacute;ticos, says of the present administration:</p>

<p>&quot;We suffer, under it, from lack of consideration of our
needs. The central Government should be fatherly. But General Wood
vetoes relief measures. The Calamity Bill,<sup>1</sup> for example.
And he pays undue attention to the desires of the Moros. We do not
know his motives. They may be honest, but we think they are spite.
He would have been better earlier in our history. Taft or Forbes
would now fail. We consider that Canada and Australia are far
better off than we. Their native governors treat on equal terms
with the British Premier. We go to Washington as a small
boy&mdash;as an inferior to a superior, petitioning.&quot;</p>

<p class="sup"><sup>1</sup> See pp. 146-8 ante.</p>

<p>A successful mestizo commission merchant who hates politics and
eschews them in the interest of his trade says:</p>

<p>&quot;You are not good colonizers. I greatly prefer the British
way of frankly colonizing, and then handling the colony with a firm
hand for its own best good by a steady policy that never changes no
matter what happens in the Mother Country. What America does is to
keep us always in a ferment of uncertainty, making us a toy of her
domestic politics. You have done a great deal for us materially,
but that is because for a long time you sent us a set of
first-class men.</p>

<p>&quot;And yet I don&#39;t know that we need to be very grateful
to you. You don&#39;t give us much real thought in Washington. If
you did, you would not have let Harrison, a bad man, play mischief
with us so long undisturbed, and you would now not leave a good man
unsupported, while you seem to be as much afraid of our rascal
caciques as we are. Or else are you charmed by their slick tongues?
Or else&mdash;and this I think is the truth&mdash;you are not
&#39;minding your own business.&#39;</p>

<p>&quot;Without consulting us, you made us your business. Now I
think the least you can do is to take the trouble to look into our
affairs as they actually exist and use better judgment as to what
these people are&mdash;both yours and ours&mdash;who blatherskite
about us in Washington.&quot;</p>

<p>Having quoted so many anonymous speakers, it is a pleasure, now,
to give the word of one who is never afraid to be quoted&mdash;Dr.
Trinidad H. Pardo de Tavera, man of European cultivation and
experience, citizen of the world, strong-hearted gentleman.</p>

<p>&quot;The first of all this trouble was that President Roosevelt
took Governor Taft away too soon. I told Mr. Roosevelt so.</p>

<p>&quot;In America you like to say: &#39;No man is
irreplaceable.&#39; But that is not true.</p>

<p>&quot;England knows. Look at Egypt. She kept Lord Cromer there
for many years.</p>

<p>&quot;It is like a general commanding a campaign. There is
something very personal in the art of leading men&mdash;an
individual, personal element. You cannot change leaders without
upsetting and unsettling everything in the field.</p>

<p>&quot;You should not change our Governors so often. You disturb
all progress.</p>

<p>&quot;The situation is now impossible. How it will come out I
don&#39;t know. But I say this:</p>

<p>&quot;The solution is in Washington.&quot;</p>

<h2>Chapter XXI &mdash; NAMELESS AND AFRAID</h2>

<p>This book&#39;s purpose is to furnish materials, not to draw
conclusions. And if the material seems sometimes rather rough, it
may be remembered that there is no kindness in glozing the
patient&#39;s case to the physician.</p>

<p>No people in the world, as far as records exist to show, are
affected with a larger number of inherent diseases than are the
Filipinos. Over 90 per cent have intestinal parasites. Probably
half have tuberculosis.</p>

<p>Thirty-eight thousand die annually of malaria. Five hundred
thousand are always in chills. Research has proved that the diet of
the masses&mdash;mainly polished rice&mdash;is entirely inadequate
to human needs, and that beriberi, a fatal sickness due to
insufficient nourishment, is steadily increasing in the Islands.
This general state of malnutrition, coupled with the many definite
maladies from which the people suffer, and with the fact that their
common habits of eating might have been expressly designed to
produce infection, makes physically poor bodies whose resistance to
any and all disease is terribly low.</p>

<p>These circumstances constitute a purely biological viewpoint,
bearing directly on the ability of the Filipinos to hold their own
with other races less seriously handicapped.</p>

<p>&quot;How,&quot; asked an eminent world-sanitarian, &quot;can
they stand the stress of modern civilization until they get their
bodies into better shape?&quot;</p>

<p>But to change the dietary and living habits of any people is no
easy matter. Even with absolute authority it could not be done over
night, especially when the general intelligence is low, and where
every stratum of the social fabric has almost equally to be
convinced and taught.</p>

<p>The question is also largely economic. The income of the average
Filipino having a wife and three children to support is, as has
already been said, not over $6.00 a month. With that sum of money
to live on, with conditions of agriculture, of financial recourse
and usury, of land tenure and peonage, such as are to-day permitted
or imposed by a Filipinized Government, the masses&#39; power of
self-help, like their hope of human mercy, is slight indeed.</p>

<p>Hookworm, with its tremendous hold upon the populace, is
probably responsible for much of the lassitude of
character&mdash;for the lack of continuity of effort, visible
everywhere. Even at the top of the ladder the whole present-day
history is a tale of grand beginnings,&mdash;of ambitious
conceptions begun with a flourish, carried on for a brief day and
then let fall, forgotten, as a child drops and forgets a toy.</p>

<p>It would be too much to attribute all this to a physical
malady&mdash;and the malady is to-day being combated, after a
fashion and in a measure, by the Filipinos themselves. But it is
scarcely reasonable to expect a hookworm-sapped people to stand up
straight and vigorously fight their master&mdash;that very same
hookworm that has them down for the count.</p>

<p>One direct consequence of the Filipino&#39;s small bodily
strength is seen in high costs of production. The experience of the
Manila Electric Company illustrates this point. It shows that while
Filipino and American may be exchanged, man for man, in the light
jobs, as street-car operators, three to four Filipino track
labourers are required to do the work that in America one white man
does. Add to this figure the expense of the much greater
supervision required in using Filipino hands, and you find
track-work costing nearly as much in the Philippines as in the
United States.</p>

<p>Carried into other fields and considered with the fact that the
Filipino&#39;s wage greatly exceeds that of the labourer of Java,
China or Japan, the physical factor gives an element not to be
overlooked in weighing the chances of Filipino products in a
competitive market where they must meet on equal terms those of
other tropical countries. And this condition will not be greatly
affected by the direction in which markets are sought.</p>

<p>In hemp, the Philippines are in a measure safe&mdash;with a
safety resting on nature&#39;s own gift of a fibre plant that makes
the best rope in the world. But, judging by the insane flaccid-ity,
the pottering idleness with which, in the winter of 1923-4, the
Filipinized Agricultural Department and the entirely preoccupied
Legislature confronted a deadly hemp pest, the life of the
Philippine hemp industry depends on its unaided star&mdash;and may
at any moment flicker out for all time.</p>

<p>But in exports other than hemp, Filipino producers have the
world to face if America&#39;s special favour is withdrawn.</p>

<p>The probable effect, in such an event<sub>;</sub> is thus
forecast in the minutes of the yearly meeting of the Hongkong and
Shanghai Banking Corporation held on February 23, 1924.</p>

<blockquote>In the Philippines trade has been prosperous owing to
the high prices still obtainable for their principal
exports&mdash;sugar and hemp. Should their political status remain
as it is and their favoured position as regards the U. S. tariff be
maintained, a few more years should see a complete rehabilitation
of the finance of the Islands.</blockquote>

<p>This favoured position is the mainstay of the export trade of
the Islands and, should it be withdrawn for any reason, the outlook
for merchants and agriculture would be extremely disquieting.</p>

<p>Nor was this opinion confined to foreign observers.</p>

<p>The uncertain mind of the American Congress as to granting
Philippine independence reflected great general uneasiness among
business men in Manila in the winter and spring of 1924. It is my
personal experience to know three men of means&mdash;two of them
merchants&mdash;who decided at that time to risk their fortunes no
further.</p>

<p>&quot;It will be too late to sell out at fair rates when America
has announced that she is going,&quot; said one of these three, on
a day late last March. &quot;My interests are heavy. They cannot be
quickly converted. I reckon that your country will soon tire of the
importunities of our pol&iacute;ticos and will pledge them what
they ask&mdash;at longest in ten years&#39; time. I have weighed
the chances and I have waited as long as I dare. Yesterday I
started in on a final and definite scheme of getting gradually rid
of all that I own here and of transferring my investments under
another flag.&quot;</p>

<p>In addition to the three men above indicated I am informed of
several others&mdash;Filipinos all&mdash;who are adopting the same
course.</p>

<p>In listening to these merchants, one does not get, after the
first formal stage is cut through., a very flattering reflection of
America. Again it is impossible to use names, but I quote none but
men of importance.</p>

<p>This speaker is a Spanish mestizo, an importer:</p>

<p>&quot;We do not want this country to become a United States
territory because we know that, if it were so, all its business
would be assumed by the Trusts. They would know how to see to it
that the laws here, as in America, favoured them. We have never had
a right tariff here since the American occupation. You are still
debating your own tariff. Right there at home you have never been
able to decide what is good for yourselves. How, then, should you
know how to make sound tariff regulations for a stranger country,
thousands of miles away, living under conditions in every way
different from yours?</p>

<p>&quot;What we need here to quiet our troubles is a political
definition&mdash;i.e., to be told by America exactly what she
intends to do with us.</p>

<p>&quot;But if you will let us make our own economic laws I
don&#39;t care what you do with the Government.</p>

<p>&quot;This talk about political independence is mere idleness
until we first shall have established economic independence.</p>

<p>&quot;It is as childish as the boy who declares himself
&#39;independent&#39; of his father and then goes back home for his
pocket money or his keep.</p>

<p>&quot;I am in favour of free entry of American goods into our
ports. America is sovereign here and has done much for us. She is
therefore entitled to certain privileges. But America enjoys in the
Philippines not only free trade but also tariff protection. The
tariff she puts on British, Japanese and other goods is
prohibitive. The result is that she has no competition in the
Islands; <i><sup>1</sup></i> that the prices for American
goods&mdash;which people here must buy or go without&mdash;are very
high. Consequently our profits as importers are small. We don&#39;t
want you to acquire any more control over our resources.</p>

<p class="sup"><sup>1</sup> Compare figures given on p. 7 ante.</p>

<p>&quot;As to Independence, I do not want Philippine Independence
now. If you quote me in that, I shall have to say, publicly, that
you are not speaking the truth, and even at that you will have done
me a lot of harm. But neither I nor any other Filipino business man
wants Philippine Independence. Only college students and
politicians cry for it. The students simply because they have been
taught the cry by the politicians. But not even the
politicians&mdash;not one&mdash;really want Independence. I know
them all&mdash;and I know what I am talking about. Yet, having
started their noise as a means of making a living, they have to
keep it up.&quot;</p>

<p>Here follows the statement of a professional man of conspicuous
legal standing and ability&mdash;one whose life is lived in Manila
among his brother mestizo <i>ilustrados.</i> He talked with great
care and earnestness, anxious to make the most of what he called a
unique opportunity&mdash;to express his view to the American people
without sacrificing both position and peace by exposing his
name:</p>

<p>&quot;We are not ready for Independence. Independence without
army or navy would be merely nominal, for we should fall into the
power of another nation, as Japan or China. Our people believe,
because our pol&iacute;ticos tell them, that under Independence
they would pay less taxes and would be freer in every way than they
are now. All that is now obtained by our taxes is needed to
maintain what we now have. Present financial conditions forbid the
assumption of farther expense on government account, such as the
construction of defences.</p>

<p>&quot;To show the prevalent ignorance on these matters, in a
recent meeting of prominent Filipinos and Spaniards we spoke of
means of defending ourselves as an independent state, whereupon one
of the foremost men present said:</p>

<p>&quot;&#39;That is a detail. We can fight with our
teeth.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We fought Spain with bolos, not teeth. But times have
changed and we could not fight a modern force even with rifles.</p>

<p>&quot;I have often thought that a good measure to sober us would
be to conduct parties of our responsible men through
Corregidor&mdash;to show them guns, ammunition, quantities, and to
tell them the actual cost of these things. Then they might see that
not all our government resources dedicated to that one object, the
fortification at Corregidor, would suffice to maintain it.</p>

<p>&quot;Not long ago I met a Major of the Reserve Corps, a
well-known American, a flier, a man friendly with the Filipinos. He
said, in a company of Filipinos:</p>

<p>&quot;&#39;It would be easy to defend this country with twenty
airplanes.&#39;</p>

<p>&quot;At the time, I had no absolute knowledge to dispute him,
but I know now that twenty airplanes would be no use whatever
against, for example, a Japanese force. They also have airplanes
and much else beside.</p>

<p>&quot;As for the Major, his speech was a very harmful one, a
very unfriendly one in fact, for he played upon the ignorance of my
people.</p>

<p>&quot;The demand for Independence&mdash;that was to be expected
from the first day of American occupation. We were told we were
being prepared for independent government; and from time to time,
ever since, individual Americans have encouraged the idea. Even the
training in the American public schools here in the Philippines
develops the natural wish for Independence. But the greatest
handicap of all, for contentment and peace, comes from the
Americans among us. A great many Americans have come here really to
do their best for the islanders. But many bring with them their
race prejudice and make us feel it.</p>

<p>&quot;If they were content to keep entirely away from Filipinos,
socially, as the English do in India, it would be far happier for
both sides, and the race feeling would not be so much noticed. But
they make the mistake of mixing in some degree, and then their race
feeling becomes evident. This gives the handle to the Spanish
friars, who are eager to point out to us the difference between the
American and the Spanish attitude toward us, to arouse thereby our
hurt pride and to stimulate anti-American feeling.</p>

<p>&quot;Many Americans here advocate fixing the future status of
the islands&mdash;that they shall become a Territory, or that
independence shall be granted on a fixed date.</p>

<p>&quot;I regard both these things as impossible.</p>

<p>&quot;Anything done now to fix our status as a Territory, or any
promise to give us our independence in a term of years, would mean
nothing to me because I know that no such promise could with
certainty be fulfilled. Take the promise to make us a Territory in
five or ten years&#39; time: when that time had elapsed, the
American people would realize that, being made a Territory, the
Islands would inevitably next demand statehood. It would not be
good for America to have in her Congress legislators from so great
a distance, with interests that might well be foreign to the
interests of the nation. And this fact would soon become
conspicuous to the public mind.</p>

<p>&quot;In the same way, I consider that no promise to give
freedom twenty-five years hence could be binding. No one can see
what conditions will obtain or what consideration will have to rule
twenty-five years hence. This matter of Independence and of status
cannot be settled now. It should be settled by our sons or our
grandsons.</p>

<p>&quot;Especially in a democratic country like America, political
and social conditions can never be foretold. The preamble of the
Jones Law was a very great mistake.<sup>2</sup> Americans claim it
is meaningless&mdash;a mere sop to the Filipinos. But I claim that
it is a promise. Yet, even so, it is very vague. Who is to be the
judge when our government is stable? Surely not we. No man can be
judge in his own case.&quot;</p>

<p class="sup"><sup>2</sup> The Jones Law itself contains no
mention of the question of future independence for the Philippines.
But the preamble, in its second clause, gave the text for much of
the present argument. See Appendix I.</p>

<p>It is probable that no one who has not really worked in the
Philippines, among the Filipinos, and on this general subject, can
fully realize the value of the foregoing testimonies&mdash;the
difficulty with which men&#39;s confidences are obtained in a
country where fear pulls always at the elbow, and where the
consequence of betrayal is destruction. The words here quoted will
sound commonplace enough in free America. In the Philippines, with
the shadow of Independence always in the air &mdash;with the
ever-present fear that America may withdraw and leave free
vengeance in the saddle, they are as startling as public
suicide.</p>

<p>Again I quote a distinguished Filipino lawyer: &quot;One
question I would consider prior to Independence: &quot;We now shut
out the Chinese and Japanese&mdash;or try to do so&mdash;not very
effectively. If we were independent could we keep them out? If the
Chinese came by the thousands and millions we could not survive.
They are born and trained to a strenuous life. They can live where
we would starve. We have so easy a climate that we are soft. We
could not fight them off. We should have to let them come. Our
people have taken none of these serious things into account. I
don&#39;t dare talk frankly to my Filipino friends. There is no use
arguing where arguing won&#39;t help. But I say, regarding the
Chinese and Japanese, that apart from any military aggression, we
would find them trying to dominate commercially and we should have
to respect their wishes. Under our flag they would oust the English
and Americans in a few years. If American products had to pay here
the same duty as those of Japan, they could not compete with Japan.
I know the Japanese. As to the belief that they would fight the
battle of the Orient against the West, they would as quickly fight
Filipinos as Chinese or Russians. There is no racial solidarity in
the Orient. We could combine with the Chinese, but not with the
Japanese. Their idea of greatness is too big.</p>

<p>&quot;As to exploitation of our resources by Americans, we fear
it as a future danger, but none has as yet taken place. There is no
big American business here now.</p>

<p>&quot;It may fairly be said, with blame to America, that the
shyness of American capital to come here prevents our development.
Our own people are not investors, but, beside that, aside from a
very few fortunes, we have very little wealth.</p>

<p>&quot;You may say capital is conservative and likes to be
assured of the conditions of a country in which it is to invest. To
that I answer: &#39;Yes, but that fact in no wise alters the real
question nor does it remove your blame. For America <i>should
know</i> what is going to happen here. She has the power to
dictate. Therefore she has the responsibility. If our conditions
are so uncertain that we cannot attract the capital we need to
develop our resources, then that sad condition is the fault of the
United States of America and of nobody else.&#39; &quot;</p>

<p>The following words are those of an outstanding mestizo merchant
with interests all over the Islands:</p>

<p>&quot;We are not ready for Independence. We lack the first two
requisites&mdash;money, and good leaders&mdash;responsible, moral,
Christian men educated in experience. In leaders we must have both
honesty and experience. Either one without the other will fail and
we have no such combination now visible in our political ranks.</p>

<p>&quot;We need a protector. Who shall it be? Japan? We don&#39;t
know her Why not America, who has already advanced us so greatly in
material things? But has she yet advanced us so much in moral and
spiritual things? You have done much for us, but you should do far
more.</p>

<p>&quot;At the bottom of the demand for Independence lies
chiefly</p>

<p><i>amor proprio.</i> So many Americans make light of us. Not
your generals and colonels, but your little lieutenants and their
wives. Not your principal business men, but their office clerks. We
understand this quite well. And yet they sting our pride; and
because we are stung we say, &#39;Give us Independence of these
people. Get them out of our country, no matter at what cost!
&#39;</p>

<p>&quot;This is particularly true among our young and radical
element who go in more for talk and know nothing of the meaning of
talk. They feel they would rather be poor and free than have the
help of people who look down on them. I thought that myself before
I had wealth. Poor people and young people always think so, for
they have nothing to lose.&quot;</p>

<p>From another legal light comes this expression:</p>

<p>&quot;If America goes, the first economic result will occur at
once; it will be the fall of the peso to its metal value and the
disappearance of all value in the currency of the Islands. The land
taxes have never been gathered in full, and our people will never
gather them&mdash;whether through favouritism or through slackness.
The taxes at present, plus all other revenues, do not meet the
expenses of the government, and the Insular Government has to
borrow from the United States. From whom shall we borrow if America
leaves entirely? America will then no longer lend at 4 or 5 per
cent and bonds tax free. We should have to pay her what other
countries pay. Or the American people might not then take up a loan
on any terms. Who, then? Some other country? Japan? Perhaps, but on
very profitable terms and with concessions granted. And if the
terms were not met, she would not then give herself the trouble of
conquest by arms. She would find an easier way effective.</p>

<p>&quot;We could never, of ourselves, produce the means to run a
modern government. Some other power, beyond dispute, would shortly
take us. Our people, though lightly taxed now, will submit to no
more.&quot;</p>

<p>None of the men quoted in this chapter is a politician. All are
either business or professional men in active life. But it is to be
remembered that the politico, not the business or professional man,
is speaking for the Philippines in Washington today; that the
politico is training the minds of the young upcoming mestizo
student class who will take the present political leaders&#39;
place.</p>

<p>To go into the political argument is remote from the purpose of
this book&mdash;excepting in so far as it is tied into a study of
the character and mentality of the people. Contributions to
character study come, for example, from the response of the
politico to certain definite questions.</p>

<p>&quot;How do you propose to maintain your Government, with
American markets no longer presenting free entry to your goods;
with America no longer carrying your expenses for foreign
representation in consulates and embassies all over the world; with
the sums now spent in the Islands by the United States Army and
Navy cut off; and with the necessity of floating your loans without
backing in foreign money markets?&quot;</p>

<p>This question, asked of dozens of professional Independentist
politicians, produced always the same result. To choose the words
of Senator Osme&ntilde;a:</p>

<p>&quot;Those are details to which we shall attend after
Independence is granted.&quot;</p>

<p>The answer has been so uniform in effect that it is useless to
burden the page by requoting it in slightly different phraseology.
It is understood that no more explicit statement has rewarded the
inquiries of Washington.</p>

<p>A further obvious question, often put, is this:</p>

<p>&quot;In view of the length of time in which you have been
asking for Independence, it is fair to assume that you have a plan
for meeting the costs of national defence out of your own
resources. What is the plan?&quot;</p>

<p>Here, again, a practically uniform answer is received. The
following&mdash;one of the most detailed and perhaps the most
intelligent&mdash;was given me by the principal Filipino political
economist.</p>

<p>&quot;Of course we realize that we must raise more state
revenues by taxation. But that will be easily done. We can live on
50 per cent of what we spend on living now. Our climate is
favourable. Our wants are simple. Given a few years&#39; time we
can find new markets, and become indifferent to those of America.
Besides, if the United States should impose taxes on imports from
the Philippines, we should retaliate by taxes on luxuries from the
States, such as automobiles. But the effect on us! of your taxing
our exports would not be great. As to the direct question of
defence, we have a citizenry willing to fight. We have no land
boundaries.<sup>3</sup> We have small vulnerability.</p>

<p class="sup"><sup>3</sup> The coast line of the Islands, however,
measures 10,850 statute miles.</p>

<p>&quot;But we hold we shall not be attacked. We are so rich that
the mutual jealousies of the Great Powers will defend us&mdash;the
one against the other. Further, military experts say that in ten
years tim&eacute; we could be rendered impregnable.&quot;</p>

<p>Q. &quot;As independent? At your own cost? What money will
supply your defences?&quot;</p>

<p>A. &quot;We can build submarines&mdash;and airplanes
also.&quot;</p>

<p>Q. &quot;Do you know what they cost?&quot;</p>

<p>A. &quot;No. I have not looked into that detail. But you must
remember that in 1898, when America took the Islands, we had a
strong arm able to defend the country. We therefore hold that the
United States, in leaving the Islands, has a moral duty to leave us
as well off relatively for self-defence, as we were then. In fact,
we feel it the continuous moral duty of the United States to see to
it that we are never attacked by any power at any time. We expect
that.&quot;</p>

<p>This statement shows the chief political economist of the
country looking to a 50 per cent reduction of living expenditures
levied on the whole people to produce revenues sufficient for
national defence. In connection herewith it is illuminating to
recall:</p>

<p>First:&mdash;That seven years of practical autonomy reduced the
country to bankruptcy.</p>

<p>Second:&mdash;That two years of very skilful work by a capable
American administrator, plus generous help by the United States
Government, pitted, after the first fright, against the frenzied
resistance of the political leaders, barely succeeded in restoring
credit and balancing revenues and budget.</p>

<p>Third:&mdash;That the whole cacique class, to which our
political economist belongs, does not exceed six or seven per cent
of the population.</p>

<p>Fourth:&mdash;That the remaining 93 or 94 per cent whom he
invites to reduce their living expenditures by 50 per cent to pay
the price oil a second experiment in autonomy, are now fighting for
their lives against tuberculosis, beriberi and hookworm on an
average sum of $70 per family of five, per annum.</p>

<p>One final glance must now be, given to the status of the
&quot;Independence Fund.&quot;</p>

<p>In preface it should be recalled that the Philippine Islands, in
accordance with the provisions of the Jones Law, are continuously
represented in the United States by two Resident Commissioners.
These men are chosen by the Philippine Legislature and hold office
for three years. Out of the United States Treasury they are paid
mileage, salary and allowances identical with those of our
Congressmen, and they are accorded, by law, official recognition in
all Federal Departments. The Filipino pol&iacute;ticos, however,
saw use for further representation.</p>

<p>They therefore caused their Legislature to create a Commission
of Independence, consisting of the presiding officers of both
Houses of Legislature and of such other members as these two might
select. The creative Act was adopted on November 7, 1918. The
duties of the Commission, in brief, were to study and recommend as
to the negotiation and organization of the independence of the
Philippine Islands; as to securing external guarantees of the
stability and permanence of independence and of territorial
integrity; and as to organizing a new internal government. The
Commission was given plenary power to act for the Legislature and
to represent it during its recesses; to appoint and instruct agents
and missions who should serve either at home or abroad; and to
exercise &quot;all other functions and powers that the presiding
officers may deem necessary incidental to the carrying out of the
purposes of the Commission&quot; which Commission &quot;shall
continue to exist until the purpose for which it was created shall
have been attained.&quot;</p>

<p>The newly created body immediately ordained &quot;an
extraordinary mission to the United States&quot; to be presided
over and directed by Mr. Quezon. This mission was to be composed of
not over twenty-five Filipino citizens, as designated by the
President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House. To the
Legislative resolution approving the above arrangement was appended
the following clause:</p>

<blockquote>Be it further resolved, That, to defray the expenses
incident to the fulfilment of the duties of the mission referred to
in the preceding paragraph, any funds appropriated for the
Philippine Legislature or for either of the Houses thereof, are
hereby made available.</blockquote>

<p>And a second resolution approved by Mr. Harrison helped out as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>Such per diems or additional compensation may be
granted as the Commission may authorize, any provision of existing
law to the contrary notwithstanding.</blockquote>

<p>But the Commission was to receive more definite and special
financial care. On December 15, 1920, Mr. Harrison approved Act No.
2933, providing a self-perpetuative million peso annual
appropriation, payable out of the Insular Treasury &quot;to defray
the expenses of the Independence Commission, including publicity
and all other expenses in connection with the performance of its
duties&quot; and no questions asked.</p>

<p>Yet, as has already been indicated,<sup>4</sup> grave doubt
arose in other quarters as to the legality of such use of public
funds&mdash;doubts that would have caused prompt action but for the
reluctance of Governor-General Wood to take any avoidable steps
resembling repression of a national impulse toward freedom. Again
and again, publicly and privately, he had said to the
pol&iacute;ticos:</p>

<p class="sup"><sup>4</sup> See pp. 142-4 ante.</p>

<p>&quot;You accuse me of being the enemy of your independence. I
am its best friend and worker. I show you the way to prove your
case before the people of America. Show accomplishment in public
works. Show care of your defectives, your helpless, your sick. Show
care for the welfare of your women and children and in an honest
desire to protect the rights of your masses and of foreigners. Show
constructive legislation, a building up of your agriculture,
commerce and finance and an intelligent co-operation with
America&#39;s proven friendship. Let me be your lawyer, take my
advice, and I will win your case.&quot;</p>

<p>Their answer had been barrenness and fresh cabals. And yet,
hopeful always, and patient, the Governor-General spared the
Independence Fund, for its name&#39;s sake, till the eleventh
hour.</p>

<p>At last, on or about February 15, 1924, Mr. Benjamin F Wright,
the Insular Auditor, definitely questioning the constitutionality
of the Act of the Philippine Legislature creating the standing
million-peso Independence Fund, suspended further payments under
that Act. In detail, he notified the Special Mission then in
Washington that he would suspend payment of its per diem pending an
investigation and decision on the question involved; that he would
allow $10,000 to settle its accounts in America up to March first;
that he would allow another $10,000 for home-coming expenses; and
that, in lieu of the suspended per diem, he would approve vouchers
for actual expenses and for all proper and legitimate expenditures.
He informed the Mission, however, that the payments would be made,
not through its Washington disbursing office, but through the U. S.
Bureau of Insular Affairs in Washington.</p>

<p>This step aroused frantic denunciation from those directly
affected and was followed by wild misrepresentation as to the
nature and consequences of the Insular Auditor&#39;s act. Mr.
Wright meantime received the hearty private thanks and
congratulations of many of the most important Filipinos in Manila,
and even the native press was not without its favourable response.
On March 5, 1924, <i>La Naci&oacute;n</i> (Filipino Independent),
said:</p>

<blockquote>The decision of Insular Auditor Wright...calls
attention to the fact that campaigns for Independence should be
maintained with private and not public funds, as is evident here,
considering the sources of the taxes; out of every million pesos
collected into the treasury eight hundred thousand come from
foreigners. Although it is true that this money, upon entering the
public coffers, becomes the property of the Government, yet it is a
fact that these taxpayers will not pay a cent voluntarily to carry
on such a campaign.</blockquote>

<p>Upon the Insular Auditor&#39;s announcement of suspended
payments, a movement was immediately started in the Philippines to
demonstrate the strength of the Independence movement, by raising
through popular subscription a new million-peso Independence Fund
beyond the Insular Auditor&#39;s reach.</p>

<p>But the Filipino people are little used to public giving.
Subscriptions accrued with difficulty. Some of the big gifts at
first proclaimed turned out to be either the I. O. U.&#39;s of
insolvents, or else no gifts at all, but merely vague promises of
loans or advances. Sinister reports came in of extortion inflicted
upon the always victimized Chinese merchants of the
provinces&mdash;of deceptions practised upon the Moros of the
South&mdash;both to swell the new fund from sources fundamentally
averse to Independence. Small government employ&eacute;s
complained, when they dared, of levies imposed upon their slender
pay. Individuals lamented that they feared to refuse contributions,
yet bitterly begrudged money wrung from their hands only &quot;to
be squandered by gamblers in Washington.&quot; And presently even
the political press began to rail at rich legislators who fought
for the chance to go junketing to America at public expense, but
who now found no cash in their private money-bags to give &quot;for
their country&#39;s good.&quot;</p>

<p>A considerable although disputed sum was finally, however,
raised. And because this &quot;Independence Fund,&quot; whatever it
was, came through individual effort, public interest for the first
time enquired as to its administration. <i>La Naci&oacute;n</i>
said:</p>

<blockquote>The beneficial influence of the action of Insular
Auditor Wright is now being observed, for at the meeting of the
National committee for the Independence Fund, Representative Rafols
explained the necessity of strict economy by abolishing superfluous
services and reducing salaries. It &quot;is understood that an,
account of all the expenses and activities of the independence
commission will be presented to the public, together with a list of
all the employ&eacute;s and their corresponding salaries which
until now have been kept from public knowledge...The sending of
useless missions, like that which went to the United States knowing
that it would find Congress adjourned and President Wilson in
Europe, will not be repeated.</blockquote>

<p>Yet not so easily, nor at all, did the officials of the
Commission accede to the demand for publicity in the matter of
disbursements,&mdash;and the Filipino press agreed that it was not
always advisable to publish expense accounts. <i>El Debate,</i> for
example, was ready to concede that the Commission should enjoy
&quot;intelligent publicity compatible with secrecy which they have
a right to, in view of their delicate work.&quot;</p>

<p>But in June 4, 1924, the <i>Manila Times</i> (American) carried
an open letter from Representative Gregorio Perfecto of the
National Committee on Collections, giving a list of the reduced
salaries or per diems as allotted from the new Independence Fund.
Aside from accounts with beneficiaries in the Philippines, this
letter gave figures as to the members of the mission then in
Washington as follows:</p>

<p>Manuel L. Quezon<br>
For clothes, P1800 ($900) monthly.<sup>5</sup> Per diem during stay
in the United States, at P180 a day, P5400 monthly.</p>

<p>Manuel Roxas<br>
For clothes, P1800 monthly.<sup>5</sup> Per diem, during stay in
the United States, at P180 per day, P5400 monthly.</p>

<p>Sergio Osme&ntilde;a<br>
For clothes, P1800 monthly.<sup>6</sup> Per diem, during his stay
in the United States at P90<i>&mdash;</i>P2700 monthly.</p>

<p>Claro M. Recto<br>
For clothes, P1800 monthly.<sup>5</sup> Per diem, during his stay
in the United States at <i>fgo</i>&mdash;P2700 monthly.</p>

<p class="sup"><sup>5</sup> Two days later the <i>Philippines
Herald</i> attributed to Representative Perfecto an indirect
statement to the effect that this sum represented, not a monthly
but a total clothing allowance per person. The point is
insufficiently established.</p>

<p>This statement omits mention of expense, entertainment and
transportation arrangements.</p>

<p>Next day, however, the <i>Philippines Herald,</i> violent
Independista organ, had a moment of emotion.</p>

<blockquote>In the past patriots not only fought but died for their
country...To-day we still have patriots who are also fighting for
their country...They are paid hundreds of pesos a day and are feted
and banqueted and honoured.<br>
<br>
And on top of that&mdash;<br>
<br>
P1800 given them for well-tailored suits that Beau Brummell may
hide his face in shame when they appear on Pennsylvania Avenue,
spick and span, the cynosure of feminine eyes.<br>
<br>
How times change!<br>
<br>
Poor Juan! <sup>6</sup> It is to weep!</blockquote>

<p class="sup"><sup>6</sup> Juan de la Cruz is the symbolic name of
the tao.</p>

<p>On April 30, 1924, the Attorney General of the United States
rendered his opinion on the question raised by the Insular Auditor
as to the constitutionality of the act of the Philippine
Legislature creating a standing Independence Fund. Upon this
opinion, the Insular Auditor made final his suspension of payments
under the Act.</p>

<p>Without going into the grounds of the Attorney General&#39;s
decision it may be stated that he held the Philippine Legislature
to be wholly outside its powers and province in the matters
concerned. Once again it was exhibited as committing its constant
offense&mdash;overlaying and confounding the executive with the
legislative. Once again it had broken the Jones Law, and at several
major points. Once again it had encroached upon authority belonging
solely to the United States Congress. As an epitaph upon the
grave-stone of the thing, the Insular Auditor quoted Mr. Justice
Field:</p>

<p>An unconstitutional act is not a law; it confers no rights; it
imposes no duties; it affords no protection; it creates no office;
it is, in legal contemplation, as unoperative as though it had
never been passed.</p>

<p>The Independence Commission still exists. But its million-peso
special drawing account upon taxpayers&#39; money is cancelled.</p>

<h2>Chapter XXII &mdash; AN ANGLO-SAXON PERFORMANCE</h2>

<p>The record of the present American Administration in the
Philippines has thus far been touched only here and there. It is a
great and a strange story, and, to be handled adequately, would
require a second volume. Think for yourself what needed to be done,
and then be assured that an honest American attempt has been made
to do it.</p>

<p>Passing over the restoration of credit to a&iexcl; bankrupt and
discredited government, the restoration of currency values and of
the vanished reserve fund, and the balancing of the
Government&#39;s budget, all accomplished in two years&#39; time by
sheer skill and persistence, not only against the grain of the
machine but against the machine&#39;s furious
opposition&mdash;passing over these points as already recorded, we
may glance here and there in other directions. For instance:</p>

<p>With the coming of Governor-General Wood, the use of the
governmental health structure as a political perquisite could no
longer go on undisturbed.</p>

<p>&quot;The tremendous waste of human life in these Islands can
and must be stopped,&quot; said the new Executive,
early.<sup>1</sup></p>

<p class="sup"><sup>1</sup> Message to the Sixth Philippine
Legislature, October 27, 1922.</p>

<p>And continued not only to say it but to act upon it so
vigorously that the idea has become almost as afflicting as that
embodied in His Excellency&#39;s companion verdict: &quot;Free and
unsecured circulation of public funds among political friends is
finished.&quot;</p>

<p>The attacks of the political leaders upon this salient have been
ceaseless and not without effect. But, in spite of their sapping
and mining, General Wood had succeeded, by the end of 1923, in
forcing down the general death-rate by 14 per cent below that of
the last year of Harrison. Real vaccination campaigns have been
renewed; smallpox has almost disappeared; cholera, too, has been
driven out; the fight against tuberculosis is once more
resumed&mdash;and so it continues along the line.</p>

<p>Again:&mdash;By the end of the second year of General Wood&#39;s
administration either he or a member of his staff had visited every
prison in the Islands, had investigated its condition and had
looked into the case of each several prisoner. The result has been,
not only a great improvement in the jails themselves, but the
release of a large number of persons frivolously or needlessly
confined, and the turning of thousands of wretched, diseased and
useless lives into sound productivity moving toward freedom.</p>

<p>A third example of reconstruction is the checking of the plagues
of locusts, of rinderpest and of anthrax that the previous lax
government had let loose upon the Islands. By the practical support
of General Wood, Dr. W. H. Boynton, inventor of the rinderpest
serum, was first able to put his great discovery into such shape as
to serve the whole archipelago. This one thing has already saved
the farmers over 110,000 draught animals, the main-springs of their
livelihood. The autonomized legislature&#39;s political plays are
still prone to reproduce their old fruit&mdash;criminally loose
quarantines. But to General Wood&#39;s strong, though ever
handicapped, intervention is due to-day the survival of the draught
animal in the islands.</p>

<p>Coming to the schools, public instruction has commanded the
Governor-General&#39;s lively interest, and, besides a continuous
effort to raise fallen and debased standards in general, he has
laid particular stress on the importance of farm schools, on the
teaching of trades and of domestic science, and on the study and
cultivation of the English language. The clearing-out of American
school-teachers, now so nearly complete, is rapidly reducing the
tongue taught in the provinces to &#39;&#39;bamboo English.&quot;
Many of the Filipino teachers themselves now speak a species of
patois dangerously near plain pidgin. And a distinct if somewhat
covert tendency is observable, on the part of the political
leaders, to minimize the importance of English, in favour of the
patriotic values of the dialects to the mass. Mr. Justice Taft thus
analyzed this last feature:</p>

<blockquote>The efforts of the American Government to teach the
ignorant their civil rights and to uplift them to self-governing
capacity find only a languid sympathy from many of the
&quot;ilustrados.&quot; From them comes the only objection to
teaching English to the common people, lest they lose their
national character...The real motive for the objection, whether
conscious or not, is the desire of the upper class to maintain the
relationship of the ruling class to the serving and obedient
class.</blockquote>

<p>Mr. Manuel Roxas, speaking in Washington on Feb. 17, 1924,
before the House Committee on Insular Affairs, said:</p>

<blockquote>We have about three important dialects in the
Philippines, but...I do not think the difference is any greater
than that which exists in the English spoken in the different
States of the Union.</blockquote>

<p>The fact is that of the eighty-seven distinct native dialects
spoken in the Philippines, some differ in about the same degree
that German differs from English, while a large percentage of the
rest differ as French differs from Italian. Their continuance in
popular use is one of the great forces against the people&#39;s
emancipation and development.</p>

<p>General Wood, as America&#39;s Executive in the Islands, has
consistently and vigorously pushed military training for young
civilian Filipinos. For this he has been severely criticized by
persons who feel that such training, given such soil, can only
produce a bantam turkey-cock spirit.</p>

<p>But General Wood has expressed his belief that his duty is to
advance the Filipino in every practical way toward ability for
self-government. He holds that any people desiring to stand alone
must be prepared for self-defence. Therefore he has spared no pains
to give these people a nucleus of trained soldiers.</p>

<p>In his Message to the Legislature, of 1923, he says:</p>

<blockquote>The military training units established in the
University of the Philippines and the Ateneo<sup>2</sup> are
progressing satisfactorily. They are organized on the general lines
followed by Reserve Officers&#39; Training Corps organizations in
colleges and universities in the United States...[This training]
should be extended until it includes all those of suitable age and
physical condition, not only in the University of the Philippines,
but in other universities, and normal and high schools, throughout
the Islands. This is as important a step in the organization of the
Islands for defence as is the development of our natural resources,
commerce and communications for the establishment and maintenance
of the [independent] government you desire. This training tends to
make better citizens, to build up a spirit of service, to create
respect for the constituted authorities, law and order, and to give
those who receive it better bodies. It makes them more effective
workers, as well as prepares them to discharge efficiently their
duty to their country in case of need.</blockquote>

<p class="sup"><sup>2</sup> Jesuit school for young men and boys in
Manila.</p>

<p>The several corps, especially that of the Ateneo, turn out very
smart drills, and the young men keenly enjoy and desire the
training. How greatly they need its physical part their amazingly
frail little bodies, when seen in uniform, the more conspicuously
testify.</p>

<p>From the Filipino pol&iacute;ticos, however, comes a continuous
fire of complaint of General Wood&#39;s &quot;militarism.&quot;
This is delivered for consumption in the United States, and
illustrates the shrewdness with which they choose weapons. Knowing
the handicap that the word &quot;military&quot; may become to a
public man in our Democracy, they have used that circumstance to
the utmost in the manufacture of a special bit of campaign
publicity in the form of a complaint against the Executive&#39;s
&quot;military advisers.&quot;</p>

<p>The facts are these:</p>

<p>First: The responsibilities of the Governor-General are great.
No one man, by any approach to ubiquity, can personally supervise
them all. He must, consequently, find assistants whose whole time
he can command and whose loyalty he can trust.</p>

<p>Second: In the present state of affairs, practically every
educated and trained Filipino shrinks in terror under the whip of
leaders who denounce any man daring openly to aid America in the
person of her Executive. Consequently no American Executive can
rely for loyal, single-purposed support in any emergency entirely
on Filipino counsel.</p>

<p>Third: The Insular budget makes no provision whatever for the
employment of special assistants to the Governor-General.</p>

<p>Therefore: Being in imperative need of assistants, for the
responsible handling of his job, General Wood took those assistants
from the sole available place&mdash;the United States Army; because
United States Army officers are paid by the United States of
America. The only tax in any way laid upon the Insular Government
by the use of these officers was a per diem of five dollars
apiece.<sup>3</sup></p>

<p class="sup"><sup>3</sup> This per diem of $5 apiece for the
Governor-General&#39;s assistants was omitted from the budget, by
the same Legislature that cut off the provision for the yacht
<i>Apo</i> (see pp. 144-8 ante). The incident may be compared with
the allotment of per diem plus transportation and special
entertainment charges, to the Filipino Independence Commission in
Washington. See pp. 143 and 241-2 ante.</p>

<p>With the last-given point in view it is illustrative of the
insincerity of the Filipino political leader toward his own people
that Mr. Camilo Osias, President of the National University and one
of Mr. Quezon&#39;s right-hand men, should write,<sup>4</sup> in a
string of charges preferred against our present Executive:</p>

<p class="sup"><sup>4</sup> <i>National Forum,</i> Manila, October,
1923, p. 30.</p>

<blockquote>He has surrounded himself with a Kitchen Cabinet
composed of men more or less military, chosen without regard to the
wishes of the people, who foot the bill...</blockquote>

<p>Mr. Osias&#39;s statement recalls the expression of our old and
unterrified friend, Deacon Prautch of the rice paddies:</p>

<p>&quot;&#39;Surround himself with military men?&#39; Of course he
does! He can&#39;t have those sneaking caciques around him and
trust his orders to be done. General Wood is the most
disinterested, unselfish gentlemen I have ever met. He has done
what he saw to be right and then has sat down silently and let them
bark. Far from being a military dictator, he has fouled his hands
with washing their sores. Suppose yourself in his position and that
you were to surround yourself with a lot of Filipinos as advisers
and aides. There would always be an incentive for them, as for any
person living here, to colour things for later on. These military
men are free. They have no connections, no obligations, nothing to
fear, nor to hope. They are not to be here to-morrow. Any one who
is going to live here would be sorely tempted to temper the wind.
The military aides may not be as patient as I am, and of course
they are brutes if they don&#39;t Gustave-Alphonse all over the
place. I will also admit they are not trained liars.&quot;</p>

<p>Brigadier General Frank R. McCoy, General Wood&#39;s chief
&quot;military adviser,&quot; is genuinely liked, even beloved, by
both classes of Filipinos and throughout the Philippine Islands.
The other two, Colonel Gordon Johnston and Colonel George T.
Langhorne, kindly, faithful men both, have proved their interest in
the common welfare by tireless service.</p>

<p>Any Filipino who applies the word &quot;militaristic&quot; to
them is in the position of the downy chick who should apply the
term to its broad-winged mother hen.</p>

<p>Just before I left America for Manila Mr. Edward Clark Carter,
late chief of the Y. M. C. A. with the American Army in France,
asked me to bear specially in mind, in the Philippines, the
question whether General Wood might have exercised to advantage
&quot;a greater tact and sweetness&quot; in dealing with the
people. An opportunity arose to submit that exact question to a man
intimately acquainted with the facts, a close friend of Mr.
Carter&#39;s, whose authority I had good reason to believe would
satisfy the inquirer&#39;s mind. He said:</p>

<p>&quot;In the first place, it must be remembered that General
Wood, where friction is felt, is not dealing with the Filipino
people. He is dealing with a very few men&mdash;whose whole game in
life is to take advantage of any weakness of an American governor
to acquire that power for their own personal aggrandizement. As it
is, the criticism of most Americans here is that General Wood has
displayed too much patience and kindliness to these
pol&iacute;ticos.</p>

<p>&quot;I do not think he has. I think his has been an astonishing
performance. He has never allowed the personal side to influence
his judgment or his personal treatment of these people, under the
most intense provocation. You have seen his patience under fire. He
has never once allowed his temper to show.</p>

<p>&quot;It is an Anglo-Saxon performance as against Oriental
trickery, treachery and sidestepping behind the scenes.</p>

<p>&quot;And then his physical achievement of standing the racket
for three years has been astonishing. We have all tried to get him
to take a leave of absence and go home, but he has been so tied up
in his work that he would not think of leaving. He thinks only of
his work and his interest&mdash;which is, the Filipino people. Both
he and Cameron Forbes like the Filipino people, and the great mass
of the Filipinos like them. This tempest in the teapot, on top, is
just a natural human phenomenon, having nothing whatever to do with
the real attitude of the mass. With them the relations of the
Governor-General are pleasantness itself.</p>

<p>&quot;Tell Ned Carter to set his mind at rest, and be proud of
one great American.&quot;</p>

<p>Rather an interesting incident occurred when the late Lord
Northcliffe visited the Philippines, in 1921. Enthusiastically
welcomed and feted by the Filipinos of Manila, he was twice
persuaded to address large meetings. Upon all occasions his speech
with Filipino pol&iacute;ticos contained an unexpected element.</p>

<p>&quot;Almost everywhere that I have been in the world,&quot; he
repeated, not a little to their embarrassment, &quot;I have been
approached by Filipinos with a request that I use my newspapers to
advocate Philippine Independence. It has never seemed to occur to
these men that I come of a nation of colonizers, that I have
studied this subject, that I understand it and that I cannot but
take pleasure and pride in this good Anglo-Saxon achievement of
America.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No people in the world,&quot; he said, speaking at the
University of the Philippines, &quot;have had a fairer deal than
you. I know of no other nation that would have assisted you to do
what you have done in so short a time. I am very sure that with no
other nation could you have effected an arrangement by which such a
small and scattered people as you are, by comparison with...the
great countries to the north of this place, would be saved the cost
of the protection of your country. I wonder if you realize what it
means to come from a land like I do, where we are taxed up to the
tops of our heads to support a great navy and army. You have all
that provided for you. You have a situation not unlike that of the
great British overseas states, Australia and Canada. You have the
widest liberty that I have ever seen accorded, and you have none of
the expenses of saving your existence. I talk very frankly about
these things because I can say what Americans do not say. I tell
you quite frankly, were it not for the American flag in my opinion
you would cease to exist. You imagine that your wealth is not known
to the whole world. Are you aware that some countries are so
overcrowded that they must go somewhere? Do you imagine that they
would not come here were it not for the American flag? How could
you defend your few millions against the thousand millions who are
not so very far away?</p>

<p>&quot;Sometimes I meet your Filipinos who talk about
independence. I tell them they have it, and, as well, one of the
finest blessings in the whole! world, and I have travelled a great
deal throughout the world. There are no better schools than those I
have seen this morning and I am bound to say I have never seen more
intelligent pupils. But, let me repeat: that would not prevent your
country being absorbed were it not for the United States. Perhaps
some of you may travel and see the land hunger that exists in other
parts of the world.</p>

<p>I am very sure you will then realize what it means to possess,
round about you, the wisdom and strength of the American
people.</p>

<p>&quot;Their last example of generosity was to send you one of
their greatest citizens [General Wood], If you knew his record as
well as I do you would know that you have a wise man, that you have
a just man, that you have a strong man. Strength of character is
greatly to be desired in the governor of a new people, and you are
a new people. The Filipino of to-day bears no relation to the
Filipino of fifty years ago. Fifty years ago the Philippine Islands
were known for but two things, cock-fighting and hemp. To-day the
Philippine Islands are becoming known throughout the world as the
centre of the greatest uplift the world has ever known. You have
done wonders in the very few years of your new life. But always
remember that under no other people or with no other people could
you have accomplished what you have accomplished with the aid of
the Americans.&quot;</p>

<p>Now, of the Filipinos quoted in recent chapters, all were
city-folk. Mestizos&mdash;either Chinese or Spanish. Members of the
small cacique class.</p>

<p>But do you remember the Governor of the Province of
Pam-pangas,<sup>5</sup>&mdash;that little square, pure-blooded
Malay farmer? He who fights like an Anglo-Saxon for the underdog?
He who comes straight out, as scarce a mestizo dares to come, and
defies the Big Caciques to their teeth? He who does this, not for
his own advantage, but in behalf of the victimized millions of his
poor brother Malay farmers&mdash;the real people of the
Islands?</p>

<p class="sup"><sup>5</sup> See pp. 42-46 ante. Gaspar de San
Agust&iacute;n, O.S.A., writing in 1725, claimed to have detected
in the Pampangans a strain of superiority to the other tribesmen.
He said: &quot;The Pampangans are truthful, love their honour, are
very brave, and inclined to work; and are more civil and of better
customs. In regard to their vices (for they are in the last
analysis Indians like the rest) they keep them more out of sight
and covered. In all things the Pampangans have a nobleness of mind
that makes them the Castilians of these same Indians. Consequently
these people must be distinguished from the rest. <i>Blair and
Robertson.</i> Vol. XL, p. 252.</p>

<p>Well, that same little square dark-brown fighting man did a
thing in the height of the cacique war upon America that, for clean
valour of spirit, few Christian Filipinos could be found to match.
As his immediate reward, the politico press called him too base to
couple in name with Benedict Arnold or with the faithless Brutus.
His deed as a matter of fact was worthy of the minute-men of
Lexington&mdash;and more than that, for the enemy he defied is no
chivalrous kinsman, and no embattled brethren stood at his
back.</p>

<p>Olimpio Guanzon, then, Governor of Pampangas, came out in the
<i>Manila Times,</i> on November n, 1923, with a sort of
proclamation. Printed on the front page, under his own name and
title, with big head-lines, it was more startling in its boldness
than can easily be realized in a country of protected liberty and
of free speech. This is what he said:</p>

<p>&quot;According to the theory of the Coalitionists,<sup>6</sup>
in order to be a patriot one has to be anti-American or
anti-Wood.</p>

<p class="sup"><sup>6</sup> Quezon&#39;s party. See p. 126
ante.</p>

<p>&quot;Now, may I ask what bad thing has America done during the
twenty-five years in which she has been on Philippine soil that she
should be treated thus?</p>

<p>&quot;Is it because she has implanted here freedom of culture,
education, speech, petition and the press?</p>

<p>&quot;Because she has reorganized the administration in the
Philippines?</p>

<p>&quot;Because she has constructed provincial roads all over the
country?</p>

<p>&quot;Because she has brought over here her best teachers to
teach us and educate us along modern and democratic ways?</p>

<p>&quot;Because she has constructed public buildings, public
markets, hospitals, bridges, artesian wells, systems of irrigation,
parks, an aquarium, dikes, etc.?</p>

<p>&quot;Because she has built the city of Baguio, and reclaimed
lands left by the sea (which we never dreamed of doing) and now
used by warehouses, the custom house and the piers?</p>

<p>&quot;Because she has pacified Mindanao and converted its
inhabitants into citizens?</p>

<p>&quot;Because she has given into Filipino hands all positions of
responsibility except that of the governor-general,
vice-governor-general and the posts in the supreme court?</p>

<p>&quot;Because she has consented to establish here a rural credit
system, one of the good things inaugurated during the American
r&eacute;gime, to help the small farmers, with the further security
that usury shall be done away with? Unfortunates!</p>

<p>&quot;And Wood, what bad thing has he done to be treated
thus?</p>

<p>&quot;Because he has equalized the expense of the government
with its income, for when he came there was more expense than
income?</p>

<p>&quot;Because he has decreased the number of automobiles in the
government service by selling them, when in their maintenance
millions of pesos were spent annually?</p>

<p>&quot;Because he has given a fixed allowance to provincial
governments?</p>

<p>&quot;Because he has eliminated some unnecessary employ&eacute;s
placed by conscienceless politicians to secure votes?</p>

<p>&quot;Because he has improved Philippine currency by putting it
at par, when except for his prompt action, good financier that he
is, our currency would have been the same as the German
currency?</p>

<p>&quot;Because he wished to close the Philippine National Bank
and all its branches, as well as to sell the sugar centrals because
of bad management, some of the latter being unable to pay back the
capital, and much less the interest?</p>

<p>&quot;Because he has asked the legislature to pass a bill which
would allow the sale of bonds in the United States amounting to
P150,000,000 of which P130,000,000 were to be used in paying
depositors of the bank?</p>

<p>&quot;Because he has ordered the trial and consented to the
imprisonment of some of those who have robbed the Philippine
National Bank? (I say some, because the really guilty parties are
free.) <sup>7</sup></p>

<p class="sup"><sup>7</sup> See p. no ante.</p>

<p>&quot;Because he has changed the directors of the Philippine
National Bank and the railroad which, because of mismanagement on
the part of Filipino directors, put them on the verge of ruin?</p>

<p>&quot;Because he has ordered the reinstatement of Conley after
he was absolved twice by the courts and once by the committee named
to investigate him due to lack of proofs?</p>

<p>&quot;Because he has given to a committee of Dem&oacute;crata
<sup>8</sup> representatives his proclamation and report of the
bank examiners which the presidents of both houses of the
legislature tried to keep secret?</p>

<p class="sup"><sup>8</sup> &quot;Dem&oacute;crata&quot; is the
title of the minority party.</p>

<p>&quot;If the leaders had borne themselves honourably and
impartially, I am sure that such scandals would not have occurred,
and perhaps we would have been independent by this time. But,
instead of punishing the guilty, they were given the reward of good
positions, and therefore instead of stopping the evil, it was
enhanced.</p>

<p>&quot;Why should we not lose in our enterprises when the men
placed in the jobs did not have any experience, but were made
directors or presidents without even filling the positions of
clerks in the institutions?...</p>

<p>&quot;It is better to keep silent, for the mere mention of these
things makes my blood boil.&quot;</p>

<h2>Chapter XXIII &mdash; THE HEAD HUNTERS</h2>

<p>Up to this point we have been deliberately speaking only of the
Christian Filipino&mdash;Malay tao or mestizo cacique&mdash;the man
of the hot lowlands, whatever his blood. Now we turn to the
mountaineers&mdash;the &quot;wild tribes&quot; of Luzon.</p>

<p>These are often classed together under the name of Igorots or
Igor rotes. The Igorots proper, however, number only about 70,000
and comprise but two of the distinct racial groups inhabiting
Luzon&#39;s high mountains. With such groups are also included the
Bontocs, Kalingas, Ifugaos, Apayaos, Gad-dangs, Ilongots and
others, to the number, roughly, of 450,000. No accurate census has
ever been taken.</p>

<p>The Ifugaos and Bontocs are of mixed physical types, among which
the Malay predominates. With the Igorots, the Mongol blood stands
out. The Kalingas, Apayaos, and Gad-dangs are chiefly
Indonesian.</p>

<p>All are dark-skinned folk practically unmixed for many
centuries, during which time they have continuously inhabited their
homes of to-day.</p>

<p>In general, the hill peoples are classed as semi-civilized. Yet
one of the Ifugaos&#39; handiworks ranks among the wonders of the
world&mdash;the greatest system of stone-walled rice-terraces in
existence. Covering the mountain sides from base to summit and
often sixty feet in height, the length of these terraces totals
about twelve thousand miles. The soil that fills them has been
brought in baskets on men&#39;s backs. They are irrigated by a most
efficient scheme of canals and ditches&mdash;ditches often several
miles long. Their annual upkeep costs a tremendous amount of labour
and their original construction, so scientists compute, must have
taken two thousand years.</p>

A BONTOC GIRL<br>

<p>Among other cultural features exhibited by the I fugaos in
Common with the Bontocs and the Igorots, are their building of
substantial pyramidal-roofed houses entirely of wood, elevated on
wooden pillars equipped with rat-guards in the form of hubs; their
excellent hand-loom weaving, their wood carving, pottery-making and
basketry; their original use of open and tactical methods of
warfare; their strong hereditary-clan type of social organization;
their highly developed system of private ownership of real property
and of laws of inheritance; <sup>1</sup> their intense sense of
personal dignity, of individual rights and of liberty, applied
equally to both sexes.</p>

<p class="sup"><sup>1</sup> R. F. Barton, <i>Ifugao Law,</i>
University of California Frees, 1919.</p>

<p>In their domestic relations, and in their attitude toward women
in general, the mountain people differ radically from the lowland
Christian tribes&mdash;Tagalogs, Visayans and all the many rest.
With the Ifugaos, for example, genealogies are often preserved for
from fifteen to thirty generations. This care for the line of
descent is a part of a system involving strictly observed marriage
laws, which, if not the laws of the occident, are at least as
rigorously enforced as ours.</p>

<p>As to religion, the hill peoples are diversely pagan, yet their
beliefs, says Dr. Beyer,<sup>2</sup> &quot;must not be dismissed as
mere superstitious practices.&quot; For their creed is a
well-developed polytheism comparable to that of Greece, preserved
and served by an organized priesthood exerting a considerable
influence in the community.</p>

<p class="sup"><sup>2</sup> H. Otley Beyer, <i>Population of the
Philippine Islands,</i> Manila, 1917, p. 16.</p>

<p>Spain scarcely touched these people. They and their country were
poor. Their fastnesses were exceedingly difficult of access. Their
life was Spartan and, primitive as were their arms&mdash;spears,
hatchets, bows and arrows&mdash;their fighting spirit made them not
a little formidable. So during all the era of Spain, a simple
manhood escaped the penalties of civilization, preserved intact its
ancient rigorous laws, and kept its physical state uncontaminated.
Divided by varying racial inheritances and by separate tongues, the
several tribes and even their clan subdivisions lived with little
or no intercommunication and gloried in continual warfare one upon
the other. In this warfare it was the common custom to bear home as
victor&#39;s trophy the fallen enemy&#39;s head. Hence the mountain
tribes have been known as &quot;Head Hunters.&quot;</p>

<p>Between the Filipino of the lowlands and the &quot;Igorot&quot;
of the hills no bond nor connection has ever existed. The Filipino
from a distance despises and resents the mountaineer&mdash;and
abuses him when he can. Close at hand he fears him. The mountaineer
from any position despises and resents the Filipino, refusing with
indignation to be included under that name.</p>

<p>The late Dean C. Worcester, who served for many years as
Secretary of the Interior, says: <sup>3</sup></p>

<blockquote>All the non-Christian tribes have two things in
common&mdash;their unwillingness to accept the Christian faith and
their hatred of the several Filipino peoples who profess it. Their
animosity is readily understood when it is remembered that their
ancestors and they themselves have suffered grievous wrong at the
hands of the Filipinos. In spite of all protestation to the
contrary, the Filipinos are absolutely without sympathy for the
non-Christian peoples, and have never voluntarily done anything for
them, but on the contrary have shamelessly exploited them whenever
opportunity has offered.</blockquote>

<p class="sup"><sup>3</sup> <i>The Philippines Past and
Present,</i> <b>pp.</b> 661-2.</p>

<p>America&#39;s first approach to the mountains, by the blessing
of Providence, was good. We sent splendid young men to blaze our
way there&mdash;men chosen as if by special inspiration, for their
steely nerve, their instinct for justice, their humour, humanity,
kindliness and horse sense.</p>

<p>By true service, and by a genuine passion for their task, these
young men made the word &quot;American&quot; synonymous with
&quot;Friend,&quot; to the mountain people. And their allies in
that achievement were the doctor and the nurse.</p>

<p>Much has been said, in earlier chapters, of our health work in
the Philippine Islands. Yet here again the subject must be
approached and from a new aspect. For the white magic of the
sanitary officer was to provide a touchstone to the wild man&#39;s
heart&mdash;to win by beneficent subterfuge a better victory than
that of arms and blood.</p>

<p>In this novel campaign our Chief Health Officer planted his
staff in little temporary dispensaries here and there on the edge
of the mountain regions. And each doctor scouted about the
doctoring business cannily, quietly, playing for confidence,
watching, ever, for the chance to do a spectacular cure.</p>

<p>The mountain tribes in general were and are superior to the
lowlander in physique and in general health. But some among them
bore the burden of pains or disfigurements that simple skill could
remove. Yaws, for example&mdash;a horribly distorting skin
disease&mdash;much afflicted certain of the peoples; and the cure
for yaws is easy to perform. Dr. Heiser thought it legitimate to
make use of that point to gain credit for the white man&#39;s
civilization. So he worked out a plan.</p>

<p>Now the hill man rarely bathes when he is sick. He wraps himself
in a blanket, which he does not remove while the illness lasts.
Also, he is apt to be somewhat vague in his count of time.</p>

<p>&quot;Take this stick and keep it fast,&quot; said the American
magician to the yaws victim. &quot;You see, I have tied ten loops
of cord fast around it, at regular intervals. Each morning, exactly
at sunrise, just as the first straight ray strikes over the hill,
you take your knife and you cut off one loop. But on no account, at
any time, let your eyes see the surface of your body. When the last
loop is cut off, take off your blanket and bathe. Then look.
Meantime, lie still in your blanket. Now just let me push this
medicine into your skin.&quot;</p>

<p>So then the doctor made his hypodermic injection of the
sovereign drug. And the sick man, on his part, faithfully did as he
was bid. On the tenth day, as the last loop of string fell from the
stick, he took off his blanket, bathed, looked, and, behold, his
skin was clean!</p>

<p>The effect, in his ingenuous mind and on the minds of all about
him, was enormous.</p>

<p>After that, the doctor could shift his little shack farther up
into the high wilderness. And so, move by move, before they
realized it, he was already established among their villages, a
fast friend whose word all would follow and trust. Thus he, at
length, could introduce his friend, the American school teacher.
And so at last, through the children, American influence began to
push freely toward progress and peace.</p>

<p>Another great influence for good, among the mountain people, was
the character and work of the late Dean C. Worcester who, as
Secretary for the Interior, developed a wizard-like intuition as
well as a great-hearted sympathy and understanding as to the
mountain peoples. Among other civilizing devices he started
inter-tribal ca&ntilde;aos (feasts) to bring together on a friendly
basis of pleasures shared men who, in all the ages before, had
scarcely met except in deadly combat. At these ca&ntilde;aos he
introduced athletic games, to which the people took with avidity.
And his introduction of the tug-of-war was perhaps the greatest
single element in the stopping of head-hunting.</p>

<p>&quot;Look here&quot;&mdash;Mr. Worcester would
say&mdash;&quot;you fellows measure the strength of your clans by
the number of fighting men&#39;s heads one can take from the other.
Here is a new way &mdash;American fashion. Let each clan pick its
six best men. Then we&#39;ll have a whale of a ca&ntilde;ao and
each six shall pull other sixes, till it is whipped. In that
way&mdash;by seeing who is left in the end&mdash;we&#39;ll find out
the strongest clan&mdash;and we&#39;ll find it out without
weakening everybody&#39;s show by continually killing off the
warriors. What?&quot;</p>

<p>They were willing to try. They tried. And then, to the last
vote, they were for it. And the sight of those gorgeous brown
bodies, strained to the full of each muscle and tendon in one great
moment of do-or-die&mdash;is a thing, once seen, that no man has
ever forgotten.</p>

<p>Also, it satisfied the &quot;head-hunting&quot; appetite.</p>

<p align="center"><a name="ill-17" id="ill-17"></a><img src=
"0300901h-images/0300901h-17.jpg" alt="0300901h-17.jpg"><br>
<br>
TUG OF WAR. BONTOCS</p>

<p>In these and similar ways, by tact and firmness, by goodwill and
understanding, was steady progress made without exposing an
innocent, primitive people to the usual forerunners of
&quot;civilization&quot;&mdash;whiskey, the shotgun, disease, the
exploiter, the cheating trader, religious confusions and learning
to lie.</p>

<p>And thus a wise and beautiful work went on&mdash;until the
coming of Harrison.</p>

<p>From that point the tide turned. American governors of the
Mountain Province disappeared, and with them the spirit of service.
The tribesmen from then forward were made to accept their old
enemies as rulers. Lassitude, carelessness, indifference,
incompetence at best, characterized the new administration. The
result was a heart-breaking waste of the past.</p>

<p>A different Governor-General now sits in Manila, but his hands
are tied. He may appoint the Governors of the Mountain Province,
but the Philippine Legislature must approve his appointments. And
it approves only its own kind.</p>

<p>The ruin of a great beginning is not yet wholly accomplished.
The mountain people still believe in America. A simple, loyal folk,
they still trust their friend. But America&#39;s help is almost
gone from them. She has handed them over to destruction, and she
strengthens their enemy&#39;s hand.</p>

<p>Aside from the schools&mdash;of which the best is the Farm
School at Trinidad&mdash;all that is done for them now is done by
private effort&mdash;by General Wood&#39;s personal friendship and
by the mountain missions of the Protestant Episcopal Church and of
the Church of Rome. Happy in spirit and in personnel, the work of
these stations is so excellent as to be cordially hated and
insidiously attacked by the cacique politico.</p>

<p>The mountain missions, strange to relate, are short-handed. I
know of no place in the world where young men and women volunteers
of hardihood, spirit and parts and of some private means of support
can hope to get back a more exhilarating reward for unlimited
personal expenditure.</p>

<h2>Chapter XXIV &mdash; AND THE STRENGTH OF THE HILLS IS OURS
ALSO</h2>

<p>This &quot;wild man&quot; of Luzon is a physical triumph
sufficiently dressed in a gee string. He is industrious,
courageous, imaginative, frank, loyal, honourable. He has not yet
learned to lie or to squirm. He has not escaped his share of
vanity, but he is not conceited&mdash;not an egoist. He has no
yearning for luxuries that his own prowess or industry may not
satisfy out of the means that a frugal Nature puts in his hand. He
is the best farmer, the best engineer and the hardest worker in all
the archipelago. He has had to throw his whole strength against the
unkindness of his native rocks to wrest from them food enough to
keep him alive. He can grow just so much rice. If that
fails&mdash;famine catches him. He has never a margin of surplus.
Each year, at best, brings him three hungry months in which food is
scarce. Also the air of his country is gloriously good. And at
night it is cold. So he is strong of body&mdash;and strong of will.
His pride has been to hold his own in arms against the clans. No
lowlander, no outside people, has ever dominated him or made him
crawl. He stands up straight before you with level eyes, seeks no
subterfuges and tells you the truth.</p>

<p>You can give him a huge load of supplies to carry&mdash;one that
you yourself can scarcely lift, and then you can forget it. For all
alone, he will pack it on his back a hundred miles across the
mountains, through raging streams and storms and untold hardships
and bring it safely to your door. He will not have broken open or
lost a single parcel, nor will he have loitered on the trail.</p>

<p>Experienced American school teachers agree that the mountaineer
radically differs from the Filipino, in that the former does his
school work not to escape work, but with the definite purpose to be
of practical help to his own people. And, through every
discouragement, he adheres to that end. Mountain children, given an
equal chance, in the end equal the Filipino in capacity. For what
the mountaineers lack in custom and facility, they make up in
virility, determination and persistence backed by superior physical
and moral stamina.</p>

<p>Carrying the comparison further, these teachers assert that the
mountain youth are more modest than the lowlanders, more tractable,
readier to take advice, and better able by character and by
inclination to absorb American standards of thought.</p>

<p>The boys often walk a month, in continuous journey, to get from
their remote eyries to the agricultural schools at Mu&ntilde;oz or
at Trinidad. An ordinary incident was that of the journey of a
party of little girls from far Sagada to Easter School at Baguio,
in the season of 1923. Accompanied only by an American priest, they
walked the whole distance barefooted, five days and nights of it in
a raging typhoon, soaked to the skin and always shivering cold,
each child carrying her own food. Each nightfall they made a fire
and steamed a little of the water out of their bits of clothes. As
dawn broke over the storm-swept peaks up they got, and off again.
And always they laughed, wholly cheerful, wholly self-dependent,
wholly determined and undismayed.</p>

<p>Individual Americans have given these people their very best;
for their characteristics are of the kind that go to the root of
Anglo-Saxon sympathy, and their handicaps of the sort that the
Anglo-Saxon by instinct lines up to combat. Individual Americans
will continue to give them their best, in a losing fight, if such
it must be, to the end.</p>

<p>I have talked privately to a hundred mountaineers, more or less,
of the various tribes. To each one I said in preface just what I
said to the lowlanders of all degrees&mdash;&quot;I have come to
find out your mind. I want to carry back to America a true report
of what you think and desire. I will convey your message whatever
it is. And if you trust me I will not betray your name.&quot;</p>

<p>They received this appeal with grave attention. All were ready
to speak, saying that the opportunity to address themselves
directly to America had never been offered them before. Many added
that they did not care to conceal their names; for if America
remained to protect them they feared nothing, while if America
should go, their lives were forfeit anyway. Not a few, having
spoken once, requested next day to speak again, in order, having
meditated, to amplify or emphasize their previous statement.
Several times since returning home I have received enquiries from
scattered points in the mountains: &quot;Have you told our words to
the people of America? Have you told them our trouble? What do they
say? Will they help?&quot;</p>

<p>I now feel justified in affirming that the following statements
express the mind of the whole mountain people, and that any
essential divergence will be found to come from some rare
individual who has been isolated and either terrorized or tempted
beyond his power to resist.</p>

<p>In essence, the statements agree so completely that to quote a
few is to express them all. But, despite the courage of the
witnesses, it would be inexcusable to expose them by revealing
their identity. Malay vengeance waits long for its prey.</p>

<p>The question put was this: &quot;Do you desire to see the
Independence of the Philippine Islands, the establishment of native
government, and the withdrawal of America?&quot; And I endeavoured
to convey the enquiry without colour or leading.</p>

<p>A Kalinga expressed his answer thus:</p>

<p>&quot;Mr. Quezon, of course, tells everybody that all the people
in these Islands want Independence. My people don&#39;t want
Independence. For that only means Tagalogs bullying us. Let more of
us be educated first. If Independence came now, none of us is
competent to fill higher offices. They would send Filipinos to
govern us, and then there would be trouble. My people are very
anxious to send their children to school now that they see what
schools can do. They say that if the Filipinos would spend some
money to give us schools and hospitals and nurses, and teach some
of us to be doctors, instead of sending missions to the United
States, they would have some use for Filipinos. The trouble is, my
people, except a few students who read papers, don&#39;t know what
goes on. The low-landers think themselves above the mountain
people. They always say &#39;Igorots know nothing. They can&#39;t
hold office.&#39; &quot;</p>

<p>A Bontoc said:</p>

<p>&quot;Most of my people are still savage. They can&#39;t read or
write. But they do not want to be under the Filipinos. Since
Spanish times we have known them. Pol&iacute;ticos have not
changed. No Filipino deals justly with us, and there will certainly
be insurrection in our country if Independence comes. We have
public schools and are going on all right up to now, but that is
just because one American is left with us. He is our old friend. We
wanted him for Provincial Governor. For he is just. He can control
our peoples easily because he uses an equal hand. All Filipinos are
Ilocano or Tagalog or something else. All favour their own side and
none would give us, even here in our own country, any chance. But
the Filipinos will not let us choose our own Governor.&quot;</p>

<p>The following is the statement of a Benguet&mdash;<i>a</i>
magnificent physical type:</p>

<p>&quot;We know that we are behind in civilization. And we know
that if the Filipinos were in full power, instead of teaching us
they would make us their workmen. They would take from us all our
wealth&mdash;our land and our animals, and raise our taxes. That is
the beginning of what &#39;Independence&#39; would mean to us.</p>

<p>&quot;I know that the Governor-General knows that the Igorots
are against Independence, because, whenever he comes to the
mountains, the representatives of all the different tribes make
journeys to him, asking him to use all his power to save us, that
Independence shall not come.</p>

<p>&quot;Most of the educators among us, in the public schools, are
Ilocanos. They seem not to want any of us to show progress.
Filipino officials almost never employ those of us who have a
little education and so give us a chance to learn more. Right now
there are several of us fitted to be secretary of a town, or
foreman of road building. I think we natives should be given
opportunities. But foreign Filipinos get them all.</p>

<p>&quot;We Igorots want an American Governor. This present one is
a Filipino. He sits in his house with his wife. He never goes
around to find the people&#39;s need.</p>

<p>&quot;The Filipinos trick us and steal from us. If one of them
steals a carabao, he will win, if he is rich, for the judges are
Filipinos, and they will sell the case any time. The Igorot is sure
to lose unless he pays the judge often. And the Igorot is
poor.&quot;</p>

<p>Said a Bontoc&mdash;one whose experience exceeds that of
most:</p>

<p>&quot;These Filipinos who have been put over us are really
trying to treat us better than they have ever done before. But I do
not think their hearts are changed. They hate us. It has happened
that Americans have taken pictures of Igorots and said &#39;These
are some of the people of the Philippines.&#39; And that makes the
pol&iacute;ticos angry for they think it puts Independence
back.</p>

<p>&quot;It is true that my people are very dirty. Like pigs. And
ignorant. But we want to do better. We want America to stay by us
and guide us till we learn how.</p>

<p>&quot;The mountain farm schools are the best for us. We
can&#39;t keep our health in the lowlands. But the real benefit is
they teach us on the farm schools how to go back and live
prosperously in our own place. But the pol&iacute;ticos hate our
farm schools, and are always trying to push away our American
teachers and put in little Filipinos who know nothing but what is
in their little book. We, who are farmers for thousands of years,
we can tie them all up in their little book.</p>

<p>&quot;We want to go to America to study. But they only send
Filipinos as <i>pensionados.</i> Only the American missionaries
have sent any Igorots to the United States.</p>

<p>&quot;At the time when Governor Forbes went through the Mountain
Province <sup>1</sup> the Provincial Governor did a trick. Governor
Forbes had received the <i>buknuns</i> (chiefs) privately and let
them speak their hearts to him. And the Provincial Governor was
afraid of this. So when Governor Forbes was gone, this Filipino
behaved like his kind. He sent a paper around to the chiefs of the
towns and barrios of all the Mountain Province and said:</p>

<p class="sup"><sup>1</sup> Wood-Forbes Commission, 1921.</p>

<p>&quot;&#39;Sign this paper. It is a paper saying that all the
tribes and peoples are now at peace together, according to the
law.&#39;</p>

<p>&quot;And then, when there were sheets and sheets of names, they
wrote above them something that said: &#39;We the undersigned do
hereby&mdash;so and so&mdash;and we want Independence right
away.&#39;</p>

<p>&quot;Our Mountain Provincial Governor, being a Filipino, did
that trick.</p>

<p>&quot;I suppose the paper was sent to Washington.</p>

<p>&quot;If I could go to Washington I would go to Congress and
stand up and say:</p>

<p>&quot;&#39;Don&#39;t leave the Igorots! For goodness&#39; sake
don&#39;t leave us. This is the prayer of every Igorot: &quot;Be
over us. Be our guardian. Don&#39;t leave the Philippines. Be over
us.&quot; &#39;</p>

<p>&quot;By law, one Igorot is appointed by the Governor-General to
represent us in legislature. But he cannot do a thing for the
Mountain Province. Because he is only one. He is nobody there. He
is ignored.</p>

<p>&quot;If America goes, we shall be exploited and maltreated
worse than the Spaniards ever maltreated the Filipinos. I myself
know the Filipino senator who was asked what would be done for the
Igorots under Independence.</p>

<p>&quot;&#39;Done for them?&#39; he said. &#39;Exterminate
them.&#39;</p>

<p>&quot;And that is true. They would.&quot;</p>

<p>Another Bontoc testified:</p>

<p>&quot;We don&#39;t want Independence. We know too much. We would
be treated like hell. The Ilpcanos, especially, abuse us Igorots
instead of helping us. They will rob us. They rob us now, and cheat
us. And their teachers will not give Igorot boys a chance to
learn.</p>

<p>&quot;Our mountain people want to be separated, in case of
Independence. If it comes, and if America won&#39;t keep us, but,
against our will, gives us to the Filipinos, to be their slaves, we
will make a revolt. And of course there will be fights between the
tribes too. Now, having some Americans still in Bontoc, we live in
peace&mdash;except for the weakness of the Governor, who is a
Filipino. Our Governor should be a big, strong chief, and wise and
just, like the Americans, and able to travel from place to place,
to explain and convince. We Bontocs, Kalingas, Ifugaos,
Apayaos&mdash;we are not yet civilized. We need much help, yet,
before we can hold our own.&quot;</p>

<p>The mother of an Igorot <i>buknun</i> sat in her house on the
mountainside, surrounded by little children, plucking rice-grain
from its straw. Her wrinkled old face was all sparkling with
smiles, the pose of her head and the brightness of her eyes
curiously birdlike. Her voice, like her face, crackled with life
and humour.</p>

<p>&quot;If America went away, the Filipinos would raise the price
of everything, and take away all that we have learned and gained.
America has shown us how to live and how to help ourselves. There
would be nothing for us if Americans went away. When the Filipinos
speak, they seem all right. But we are no match for them yet. We
are ignorant still. Do not let America go till these children&#39;s
children are as wise as theirs&mdash;and have guns.&quot;</p>

<p>Then comes a scene on a mountain-top. The moss-green slope is
clouded blue with ageratum and wreathed with small white roses,
golden-eyed&mdash;common weeds of a glorious land. Down, down and
away over the mighty hills like stairways of the hosts of heaven
run the rice-terraces. The air is clear and bright and cold as the
air at sea. The few little thatch-roofed houses where we stand
blend into the surface of things as do the rocks and the tufted
grass. Under their eaves many jaw-bones hang and swing, in long
encircling rows.</p>

THAT MOTHER OF AN IGOROT BUKNUN<br>
M. M. Newell</p>

<p>&quot;Why the jaw-bones?&quot; I ask.</p>

<p>&quot;Because the spirits of the ancestors like to see
them,&quot; a jolly old man in a gee string makes reply.</p>

<p>Then comes the head of the village, with three of the principal
men. One might be a Sioux Indian or a Roman of the days of Caesar.
Their speech is well-weighed, unhesitating, sure. Their bearing is
essentially poised. &quot;The Filipinos,&quot; says the chief,
&quot;lack the spirit to help any one. They certainly would never
help us. They will try to rob us if America leaves. Then we shall
fight, although our chance is poor.&quot;</p>

<p>Says the Roman: &quot;We mountain tribes are all divided now.
The American headmen were bringing us together and making us one.
Now, under the bad change, under these Filipinos that have been put
over us, we divide again and lose what we had gained. Before
Independence comes, we in the mountains should first be reconciled
and united, as one people. Then we should be able to protect
ourselves. I have seen a Filipino arguing with our people and
saying: &#39;When we are free you will have more money. Therefore
put your mark on this paper for Independence.&#39; But I know that
when taxes are not paid at the right time, then the tax is doubled.
And then, if the mountain man does not borrow money of the rich
Filipino to pay it, he goes to jail. And if you do borrow of him,
then you work for him as a slave the rest of your life&mdash;or, go
to jail.&quot;</p>

<p>Said an Apayao with a face broad as the sun:</p>

<p>&quot;We people of the Mountain Province are not yet half
educated&mdash;not even educated enough really to know what America
has been doing for us. If Independence came now, there would be a
great revolution against the Filipinos. With knives and
spears&mdash;because we must fight with what we have. And each
tribe will fight each other again, and go back to taking heads as
before America came.</p>

<p>&quot;Tell me this: If America must listen to the Filipinos, who
are false, why must she not listen to us?&quot;</p>

<p>In the commencement paper of one of the class of 1924 in a
mountain school appears this barbed passage:</p>

<p>&quot;Let us take to heart the sad spectacle of many of our
young lowland brothers who have acquired their education for the
purpose of escaping worlt, for the purpose of grafting on their own
of the tao class, and on us mountaineers...Let us here earnestly
resolve that we will always endeavour to carry out the tenets of
justice whether we be dealing with the most exalted of the land or
the most forlorn and ignorant of our fellows. Let us here resolve
never to be mouthing parasites, who prey on the ignorant and orate
on the principles of liberty, of which we possess more than any
people under the sun. Let us make our work and deeds talk for us,
leaving mouthing to weaker men.</p>

<p>&quot;We are of a sturdy race. Our forefathers were mighty
workers and mighty warriors&mdash;else our race would have perished
from the earth. So let us justify our heritage and show that
through our training we are better men than our fathers, and not
above laying our hands to the plough or the building of a road or a
wall. We have sturdy backs and strong hearts. Let us so build our
farms, our roads, our province. And above all let us build our
fellow tribesmen into a homogeneous race who will love justice and
freedom and never be afraid to raise their voices and their hands
against those who would violate that ideal.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;All mountain people love Governor-General Wood,&quot; said
a Benguet head man. &quot;We would do anything he asks, because he
is a man, and our friend. We do not like weaklings, nor liars. We
love General Wood. Once he called us together at a ca&ntilde;ao and
talked to us about a new thing. About eating dogs. He explained
that Americans do not eat dogs because dogs are friends. He said
that a dog&#39;s face shows that he has a heart like a brother, and
that dogs should be considered like children&mdash;taught wisdom
and obedience, and loved. He asked us not to eat them any more
because it made Americans feel sad and strange. So we have not
eaten dogs since, although we have been very hungry and sometimes
there has not been the smallest fish in any stream, nor any meat
for months. Many Filipinos eat dogs, though they pretend they do
not. And they can always get other meat. We often can get no other
meat. But we are Governor-General Wood&#39;s friends. And he asked
us not to eat dogs.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Bontocs don&#39;t understand Ifugaos&#39; speech,&quot;
said an Ifugao. &quot;No one understands any one else. Only our
boys who understand English; they can all understand each other.
And no Filipino understands any of us. In the old days this seemed
to us the way of the world. Now we see it is a great danger. Much
evil can come that way. It would be a terrible thing if
Independence came while we are still like this.&quot;</p>

<p>And then he told me a story:</p>

<p>Late in the year 1922, he related, there was much confusion, in
one of the far mountain districts, over a question of taxes. The
people did not understand, and the Filipino official would not or
could not explain to them. He only threatened. And they did not
understand.</p>

<p>&quot;The American Governor-General demands money/&#39; said the
Filipino. &quot;You must pay.&quot;</p>

<p>So the tribe took council together and said this:</p>

<p>&quot;If Governor-General Wood wants anything of us, that thing
must be right. He is our friend. We know that. He has come to visit
us. He has talked with us around our fire. He has taken our hands.
His word is enough. But is this his word? The Filipino is lazy and
a trickster, and he has no love for us. We know that. Can we
believe him now?&quot;</p>

<p>Again and again they discussed it. Finally their resolution was
framed: They would risk nothing, neither disobeying their friend
nor being tricked by their enemy. Four of their wisest men,
departing secretly, should go to their friend and ask him to
explain to them the truth.</p>

<p>So the chosen four, old men all, started out to walk to Manila.
To walk, because they had no money to pay carriage even over that
last small section of the road on which carriage could be had. A
month&#39;s journey it was, of constant trudging over the high
wind-swept trails and then down into the lowland heat, where the
mountaineer wilts in an hour.</p>

<p>At last Manila lay before them&mdash;a strange and monstrous
sight. With lifted hearts they entered the town. Now they would see
their friend. He would welcome them in his house, as they had
welcomed him. He would cheer them and give their weary old bodies
rest.</p>

<p>&quot;Please tell us the way to the house of the
Governor-General?&quot; they asked of one of the city crowd.</p>

<p>But the man only stared.</p>

<p>&quot;That must be a stranger here,&quot; one said to the other.
&quot;We will try again.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Please tell us the way to the house of the
Governor-General?&quot; This time it was an older man to whom they
appealed.</p>

<p>But the man, laughing in their faces, left them without a
word.</p>

<p>And so the day passed. Faint with anxiety, hunger and fatigue,
dazed by the crowd and its mockery, yet ever repeating their plea,
the four old strangers strayed through the streets&mdash;they who
were men of station, respected in their own place&mdash;they who
had never left their spacious hills before. But not a soul took
pity on them&mdash;not a creature was moved to compassion by their
all too-obvious distress.</p>

<p>The Bureau of Non-Christian Tribes exists ostensibly for the
care of these people&mdash;but it is significant of its quality and
influence that not one Filipino out of the staring city-ful who saw
these conspicuous visitors cared to connect them with the Bureau or
to get an interpreter thence.</p>

<p>Four old men in gee strings, among the sleek, smart, jeering
crowd&mdash;four old mountaineers, foot-sore, famished, pleading,
pleading&mdash;and not a soul to help.</p>

<p>That night they slept by the roadside. Next dawn they began
again. But the people only jostled and gaped and jeered. No one
could or would understand. No one would help.</p>

<p>At last, broken-hearted, they turned toward home. They had not
seen the Governor-General. They could not find him. And their
strength was gone.</p>

<p>Their hearts were broken&mdash;and their work undone.
So&mdash;three of them died by the wayside in the first three days
of the homeward march. The fourth alone, pushing on and still on,
survived to be rescued by the man who told this tale. And the tale
is true.</p>

<p>But probably not even the tale ever got to General Wood. It is
of the common stuff of daily history.</p>

<hr>
<a name="ch-25" id="ch-25"></a>
<h2>Chapter XXV &mdash; ALVAREZ</h2>

<p>Now for a people of character largely antipodal to that of the
Christian Filipino. Now for the inhabitant of the other end of this
1,150-mile-long archipelago. Now for the Moro&mdash;the man of the
Far South.</p>

<p>Yet first this shall be stated:</p>

<p>The Moro country, over which our flag flies, yet of which we
have scarcely heard, must during the last three years have
disgraced our name among nations ; must have forced itself on the
notice of the world by a wholesale madness of carnage, but for one
thing.</p>

<p>That one thing was the personal influence, not the official
power, of Major-General Wood.</p>

<p>Less and less is it possible for our Executive to bring any
actual relief to a situation daily more scandalous. For no step
that he might take&mdash;no appointment that any executive might
make with a primary view to serving the interests of the population
concerned&mdash;would be confirmed by the Filipino Legislature.</p>

<p>Manila, under existing primitive means of transportation, seems
as remote from the Moro country as does Constantinople from New
York. The little yacht <i>Apo</i> makes trips there, carrying the
Governor-General, or one of his aides, from time to time to visit
the people. But the Governor-General cannot even promise them
help&mdash;for America&#39;s hands are snared from her duty by a
tangle of lawless laws. He can only ease their over-burdened minds
by listening to their woes. He can only renew their realization of
his personal good-will and integrity and, in return, ask for
further forebearance. Then he must sail away and leave them to
their fears and their destiny.</p>

<p align="center"><a name="ill-20" id="ill-20"></a><img src=

ALVAREZ<br>
M. M. Newell</p>

<p>Without General Wood&#39;s name, and the faith the Moros bear
him personally, the peace could never have been kept. Yet without
some strong lieutenant stationed by the powder-magazine itself, to
see and quench at birth each sudden burst of flame, peace had
scarcely been possible. Each needed the other. And so, where our
American Executive was powerless to place a helper, Fate gave him a
helper of whose existence, perhaps, he scarcely knew&mdash;and with
Fate&#39;s own scorn of likelihood.</p>

<p>Young Alvarez&mdash;Milton Alvarez&mdash;was an American. His
mother came from Saint Paul, Minnesota, his father from Spain.
Young Alvarez was lean and dark and aquiline, with clear and
strikingly large grey eyes, a high-bridged, high-bred nose, a
Spanish mouth, a leader&#39;s jaw, and a free lift of the head
that, out of the blue, gave you the word &quot;hidalgo.&quot;</p>

<p>Further, the character he happened to have was nationally
important. He curiously combined a high, cold courage, physical and
moral, with a white-hot blazing devotion; an impersonal tenderness
of spirit with a chilled-steel power of purpose; an intense inner
solitude with an utter absence of self-concern. He could have loved
the comradeship of men&mdash;as he did that of books; but he did
not need men&#39;s approval. He suffered cruelly under the
misjudgment of his own kind; yet hugged it close as a fiercer spur
to that self-immolation that caused it. He had the face and the
mind of a passionate intellectual ascetic. He was so proud that he
never knew his pride, nor thought concerning it. In earlier days he
would have made a great gentleman and soldier, a great saint and
martyr of the Roman Catholic Church. As it was, his star made him
an American born, trained him as an engineer, broke him in in
Hawaii and in Mexico, and finally dropped him down on Zamboanga,
western tip of the island of Mindanao, to run the branch concerns
of a firm of American traders.</p>

<p>God knows how it could have happened&mdash;what was the meaning
of it all. The Moros say God sent him. Meantime, he worked along on
his job, opening trading stations, establishing sawmills, planting
cocoanut groves, stimulating production among the people&mdash;and
always, by instinct, living his way into their lives.</p>

<p>A scholar by nature and habit, he soon mastered their tongues
and their peculiar written Arabic. They were wild men&mdash;poor
men&mdash;men always in danger and surrounded by wrath. A simple
folk and friendless.</p>

<p>And he, Alvarez, seeing all this, put into his dealings an extra
measure of good will. He gave them fair prices for their few wares,
helped them escape the human sharks that forever beset them, showed
them how to save something of their own. Or, where they had already
fallen into a trap, he would drive off the enemy, if that might be,
and lift the victims out.</p>

<p>So throughout the island of Mindanao and over the Sulu Sea, the
Moros came to know and trust Alvarez and finally to make
pilgrimages to him, bringing their mystifications, their troubles
and their fears.</p>

<p>As for the man himself, definite orders from his firm required
that he &quot;steer clear of politics.&quot; For the firm&#39;s
investments were heavy and they would not jeopardize their fortunes
by mixing in the troubles of the day. All firms, all governments,
indeed, give like instruction to their representatives in Moro
land.</p>

<p>And all but Alvarez obeyed.</p>

<p>But Alvarez could not compass it&mdash;if &quot;steering clear
of politics&quot; meant standing quiet on the sidelines watching
brave men baited, gagged and done to death without a sporting
chance.</p>

<p>Not that he used his principal&#39;s time for such matters. Not
he; he did his firm&#39;s work well. But he took no time for
himself, cutting his hours of sleep till scarcely enough remained
to keep his body and soul in fellowship.</p>

<p>And the Moros sought him always more and more, until it seemed
that he had dealt with every phase that trouble could take in those
troubled and fear-harried lives.</p>

<p>Yet, in the end of the third year, it chanced that a new plea
reached him. The plea of an orphan girl of noble blood, shut away
in school and promised in marriage by her old uncle to a man she
abhorred.</p>

<p>&quot;I cannot marry him,&quot; she said. &quot;My father would
never have asked it of me. But my father is dead. My father was the
Datu Rajah Muda Mandi, friend of America. And now in my distress, I
hear of an American who is the friend of all Moros. Of him, being
helpless, and for my father&#39;s sake, I beg help.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Who is this girl?&quot; Alvarez asked of the head men.</p>

<p>&quot;Who, indeed!&quot; they repeated. &quot;We do not know.
Speaking of the flesh, she is our great Datu&#39;s
daughter&mdash;Rajah Muda Mandi&#39;s little daughter, whom he most
dearly cherished. Rajah Muda Mandi was the strongest ruler we ever
had, and the wisest. Had he lived we had not so lacked counsel. But
since he left us, we have marvelled concerning her. For she is so
altogether good, so calm, so gentle, so purely loving and so
sweet&mdash;so full of kindness without a cloud&mdash;that none of
us has seen her like in woman&#39;s shape. And we question if an
angel, for Allah&#39;s ends, can have taken woman&#39;s
form.&quot;</p>

<p>On these things all agreed, speaking with a hushed and special
reverence.</p>

<p>Then Alvarez went to the guardian uncle, asking him to consider
the hardship to his little niece involved in such a match; and,
having talked long and patiently, he departed with a mind at rest,
believing his point won.</p>

<p>But again, after some weeks, the messenger returned. &quot;My
uncle presses harder. He does not relent,&quot; ran the girl&#39;s
entreaty. &quot;I have heard of your intercession, but it has not
availed. Again I implore your aid, for I cannot marry that terrible
old man.&quot;</p>

<p>Once more Alvarez went to the uncle, this time with heat, for he
felt himself tricked. And in the course of the argument thus
provoked, he perceived with stupefaction an unimaginable thing: The
uncle believed that Alvarez wanted the girl for himself. So,
clearly, believed all the other Moros present&mdash;men of rank and
office among their people.</p>

<p>&quot;No!&quot; cried the American. &quot;God is my witness.
<i>No!</i> I have never once laid eyes on your niece nor spoken to
her. I know nothing of her except her distress under your harsh
hand. And as for marriage, be sure that I shall take no woman till,
after years passed and my work here done, I go to live in my own
country.&quot;</p>

<p>Through the black, glittering veil of the Moro&#39;s eyes the
hint of a smile gleamed and was gone. He answered at length
&mdash;suavely. But under his words still appeared his unchanged
rnind. In the other&#39;s most desperate denials he still saw
nothing but awkward man&oelig;uvres to reduce the sum of gifts by
Moro law payable to the guardian of the bride.</p>

<p>Baffled, furious, Alvarez flung hot denials back. At last the
Moro laughed aloud. As the two men parted, their eyes met like the
clashing of drawn knives.</p>

<p>That night Alvarez sat late at his desk. Midnight still found
him there, the strong breeze from the ocean teasing his heaped-up
papers, and pushing eternal mosquitoes back into the dripping heat.
One o&#39;clock&mdash;two o&#39;clock. Careless as ever of time, he
worked on&mdash;till, out of his own immersion, he grew suddenly
aware of a small thick scurrying
sound&mdash;growing&mdash;growing&mdash;of little hastening feet
and sweeping garments&mdash;of a presence, a stifled cry, a rush,
and a veiled girl&#39;s figure crouching at his feet.</p>

<p>In the doorway now stood an older woman&mdash;a Moro of rank, as
her dress and bearing showed.</p>

<p>&quot;I, too, am a daughter of Rajah Muda Mandi,&quot; said she,
breaking the breathless hush. &quot;My little sister, there, would
come to you, to-night. It was not fitting she should come alone.
Our uncle says that he will give her, in the morning, to that man.
And our uncle keeps his word.</p>

<p>&quot;If there be no way of escape, then she will go now, and
kill herself. I will take her, quietly, where it may be done.</p>

<p>But first, she would come to thank you. It was needful to wait
long till she could steal out unobserved, while those who watched
her slept.&quot;</p>

<p>Alvarez stared at the speaker&mdash;statuesque, sombre,
dispassionate. And then he stared down at the little gasping figure
at his feet, all swathed and hidden in its veil.</p>

<p>In that one moment his whole life cleared before him. He saw, as
a vision, the purpose and the end.</p>

<p>Brought from the width of the world to this far, hidden place,
his soul and brain had heard a voice that no other creature seemed
to hear&mdash;the call of a wild, strong people in the agony of
death. Now alone he stood between them and their persecutors.</p>

<p>In one bleak glare of light, he surveyed the road
ahead&mdash;barren rock, beset with hatred, lies and violence,
crowded with hopeless labours for a friendless cause&mdash;a road
lonely as death and as bitter, with death at the end. As he looked,
it was as if a hand pointed out his mortal bonds&mdash;his personal
desires&mdash;his hopes of place or ease or love. In a sort of
ecstasy of immolation he seized them all, tore them loose and flung
them behind.</p>

<p>From that point on, he was always to know his way, without one
shadow of doubt.</p>

<p>As to this child at his feet, because of his championship she
had already been named too often in talk. Now, behold her under his
roof, and at night.</p>

<p>And his life was pledged to the service of her people.</p>

<p>Therefore, for his part, what yesterday was madness to-day was a
command:</p>

<p>&quot;If your sister consents I shall marry her before the sun
is up. So she will be my wife, and safe,&quot; said Alvarez to the
elder woman. &quot;Then to-night you shall stay here. Myself I will
sleep outside, so that no one enters. Now, do not lift her veil
till I am gone.&quot;</p>

<p>Four years later, Alvarez told me the story, beginning in the
small hours of the night, on shipboard in the Sulu Sea.</p>

<p>The head of a carabao was dimly visible beyond his shoulder.
That half-naked snarl of humanity, our fellow passengers, coiling
in the blackness of the deck, occasionally thrust out a leg or an
arm, or coughed or groaned in its sleep. Also, the secret service
spy then watching us&mdash;a long, yellow mestizo with a
half-Spanish face&mdash;squatted against the deck-house just ahead,
listening backward like a cat.</p>

<p>And all this was commonplace enough.</p>

<p>But that Alvarez, the detached, the abstract, should speak of
himself was startling. Somehow, it stood at once clear that the
thing had never happened before and that it had, coming now, an
importance&mdash;like the signing of a last testament.</p>

<p>He spoke quietly, directly, without self-consciousness and
without reserve. He might have been talking of a stranger to us
both. And he asked no secrecy&mdash;a fact that, at the time, made
his confidence inviolable.</p>

<p>Since then, all is changed&mdash;so changed that to keep faith
means, now, to tell the whole.</p>

<p>&quot;You married, not a woman, but a cause,&quot; I said, when
his tale was done.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; he agreed, &quot;I never heard her voice or saw
her face till she was my wife. I wanted that memory, for a sign to
myself that I <i>had</i> &#39;married a cause.&#39;</p>

<p>&quot;But the people were right in what they said of her. She
has indeed the nature of an angel. Not once in the four years of
our marriage have I met a frown on her face, or heard a shade of
sullenness or anger in her voice. She is sweetness, tenderness,
innocent gaiety itself&mdash;and as obedient as a good child. When
I go on hard journeys into dangerous places, she insists on coming
too&mdash;to cook my food lest it be poisoned and to care for me if
I am sick or hurt; for she knows, as I do, that I am no more likely
than her father was to die a natural death. She is as fearless as
the bravest man. Several times she has saved my life. My house
under her influence is a sure haven of unruffled peace and
lovingkindness. Her little brothers, who live with us, treat me
with a deference and respect that never fail, and they obey at a
hint as though obedience were a happiness. I shall have no children
of my own. But no man could have a sweeter home.</p>

<p>&quot;My house has become, meantime, the council-place of the
people. And&mdash;these, you see, are an imaginative and mystic
race&mdash;they have discovered in me, they say, some strong
physical likeness to the Datu Rajah Muda Mandi, whose name they
venerate, and who died&mdash;&#39;suddenly&#39;&mdash;before I came
into their lives. Therefore, because of my relation to them and to
their Datu&#39;s favourite daughter, they believe that his spirit
is somehow reborn in me for their help and guidance. They come from
great distances bringing their troubles. I have had to build a
place to shelter them. One never knows at what moment or in what
numbers they may appear, and they must have such protection and
privacy as we can get. The secret service men follow me night and
day, as you have seen...&quot;</p>

<p>In those strange councils by Alvarez&#39;s deciding word was
many an outbreak forestalled&mdash;many a flame smothered down that
was ready to blaze into hell.</p>

<p>As to the secret service men, it is an amazing sensation, at
first, to be constantly tracked about by spies. I, too, became used
to the close attention of the round black eye applied through a
nearby crack&mdash;of the ear yearning thitherward from a carefully
averted head, of the presence under the floor, on the stair, in the
gallery, at the door, in the opposite window&mdash;or even, at some
critical moment, and on some queer pretext, in the very room in
which I sat. To a quiet American citizen going openly about
legitimate work under the American flag, it has an irritating as
well as comic effect to be so intimately watched. At times there
came an almost uncontrollable impulse to fling forth the English of
it, in words of one syllable. Yet, after all, these human barnacles
might develop some power to impede the job on hand&mdash;which was
not yet finished. So one pretended not to see.</p>

<p>Therefore, what happened all of itself, one day at sea, helped
wickedly.</p>

<p>We were heading for Jolo, Sulu&#39;s city. I stood by the
forward rail, watching the island&#39;s profile grow against the
sky. Next me stood a young Moro chief. Next him lounged one of my
guard of spies, his character, as such, supposedly unknown to each
and all.</p>

<p>&quot;What,&quot; asked the spy of the Moro, &quot;is likely to
happen to strangers who go inland over yonder?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah,&quot; said the Moro, his thin lips curving in a
blade-like smile, &quot;&#39;a stranger going inland in Sulu,&#39;
you say? Well, much would depend on that stranger, of course. Now,
if he were a Filipino going to preach independence from America, we
should simply cut off his head. But if&quot;&mdash;and here the
speaker smiled again, radiantly&mdash;&quot;if that Filipino agent
were also, by any chance, a secret service man&mdash;we should
first&mdash;ah&mdash;cut out his tongue&mdash;like this,&quot; and
he pointed his words with the hint of a gesture brittle with live
technique.</p>

<p>Then first it was that I grasped this fact:&mdash;The Moro has
often a strong and whimsical sense of humour&mdash;the Filipino
practically none at all.</p>

<h2>Chapter XXVI &mdash; THE SULU PIRATES</h2>

<p>&quot;Mono&quot; is the Spanish word for Moor.</p>

<p>The Spaniards, when they entered the Islands in the latter part
of the sixteenth century, applied the name to the people of the
southern archipelago. This they did because the people of the
southern archipelago were Mohammedan, and because, to a Spaniard,
the words &quot;Mohammedan&quot; and &quot;Moro&quot; were
synonymous.</p>

<p>Between the Moros and the &quot;Indians,&quot; as the Spaniards
called the tribes of the northern archipelago, the newcomers found
a wide difference, both in character and in status. The
&quot;Indian&quot; was a docile, light-brained child-savage,
cribbed in his own small jungle range, without well-formed
religious beliefs, without law or organized government, without
books or written records, without any art save the most
rudimentary.</p>

<p>The &quot;Moro,&quot; on the other hand, was a fighter, a
sea-rover, a reader of the Koran and a devotee of the Prophet. His
civil laws, like those of his religion, with which they inseparably
interlocked, were fixed and clear. His scheme of government and of
official control, though simple, was mature. His better classes
read and wrote their own languages, using the Hindu syllabaries and
the Arabic alphabet. He had a definite system of education. His
written records, histories, genealogies and religious works had
been preserved for many hundreds of years, and the pride of a chief
was in his collection of manuscripts.</p>

<p>He displayed much skill as a carver of wood and of ivory, as an
inlayer of precious metals, as a worker in gold, iron, steel and
bronze. He had a well-developed productive sense of beauty in form
and line. His weaving was remarkable both in quality of fabric and
in decorative design. He fought in metal armour of his own making,
cast bronze or brass cannon for his fortresses, and made side-arms
and gun-powder.<sup>1</sup> He built excellent swift boats of
various sorts and sizes, and was a master navigator.</p>

<p class="sup"><sup>1</sup> Miguel L&oacute;pez de Legazpi to
Felipe II, July <i>25,</i> 1570, Blair and Robertson, Vol. Ill, pp.
109-112.</p>

<p>He dealt in fine pearls, which his great men possessed in
quantities. His light-winged craft distributed silk, amber, silver,
scented woods and porcelains, from China and Japan. From Luzon and
the Visayas he took slaves&mdash;many slaves to do his menial work.
In fact he permanently incorporated the word &quot;visaya&quot;
into his language as meaning &quot;slave.&quot; From Borneo and
Malacca he carried home brass, copper, iron, rubies, diamonds and
spices. And his town of Jolo in the island of Sulu was a centre of
trade and the one city of the Philippines.</p>

<p>He cultivated his soil with skill, dwelling among gardens and
well-tilled fields and lived well on his own products. His
principal personages had sizable wooden houses decorated and
equipped, after their taste. The masses also lived in wooden
dwellings and were better lodged and fed than were the northern
islanders.</p>

<p>The Moro had a strict moral code and obeyed it. Public opinion,
resting on the decrees of the Koran, was exceedingly strong. By it
the chastity of women was held inviolable. And any infringement was
visited, by law, with the swiftest and fiercest of punishments. The
Moro&#39;s code as to property rights, as to punishments, penalties
and compensation for murders and for injuries, as to inheritance,
as to the protection of children, as to debts and debtors, as to
slander, was circumstantial, clear and plain. And it absolutely
governed his daily life.</p>

<p>He was a polygamist, a slave-holder and a most accomplished
pirate. But, according to his religious teachings, each of these
things was right. His piracies and his slave-raids he exercised
upon infidels only. He seldom weakened his fibre by a disloyalty to
the commands of his own severe law.</p>

<p>Historically, the &quot;Moro&quot; was an original Indonesian
pagan, whom the Chinese had known, traded with and economically
influenced since the first century A.D. and upon whom the Hindu
sovereigns of Java had laid their hands before the thirteenth
century. This latter contact had coloured his thought with
Brahminic or Vedic beliefs and had given him the elements of Hindu
civilization.</p>

<p>It was about the year 1380 that the first Mohammedan teacher, an
Arab, visited Sulu and the neighbouring islands&mdash;to find in
the nature of the people a strong natural sympathy for Islamic
doctrines. The seeds so planted made easy the way of succeeding
Mohammedan princes&mdash;missionary conquerors from Borneo. These
while retaining their suzerainty over north Borneo and their
possessions therein, became lords of Sulu, and, before another
century had passed, firmly established their rule in the whole
southern archipelago. Here the faith of Islam, assimilated by the
native stock, developed therein a wild strength and daring, a
vigorous spirit of independence, with the frankness that comes from
long enjoyment of militant civil liberty and of obedience to
law.</p>

<p>The people thus formed by fate&mdash;passionate religionists,
tremendous fighters, prosperous, proud, and free as the
wind&mdash;carried the standard of Islam north through the Islands.
The Sultans of Sulu, in particular, supported the advance of a
remarkable succession of Mohammedan missionaries. Yet, even without
the convictions of the sword, the creed itself would have won the
island peoples. But for the sudden appearance of Spain, and the
clash and deadlock that resulted, in a very few years more the
whole Philippine archipelago must have been Mohammedanized.</p>

<p>As to the methods and motives of the two contending forces
&mdash;Spain and Islam&mdash;Crescent and Cross&mdash;essential
differences were few. Both acted from sincere and intense
conviction, to the glory of God. In that cause both burned towns.
Both slew with enthusiasm. Both died as martyrs. Both took loot and
tribute. Both commandeered and enslaved the vanquished. Both
demanded acknowledgment of the one True Faith essential to
salvation.</p>

<p>When the two met, head on, Spain drew the first blood. This was
at Manila&mdash;then a Moro outpost. Rajah Soliman, governor of the
town, returned to the Spanish overture a stiff answer&mdash;
&quot;...they should understand,&quot; he said, &quot;that the
Moros were not painted Indians...They would not tolerate any abuse,
as had others. On the contrary they would repay with death the
least thing that touched their honour.&quot; <sup>2</sup> But Spain
surprised the fort, destroyed it, killed the garrison, burned the
town and seized the territory for His Most Catholic Majesty.</p>

<p class="sup"><sup>2</sup> Martin de Goite and Juan de Salcedo.
<i>Voyage to Luzon,</i> 1570.</p>

<p>In 1578, having with little or no difficulty established control
of the childlike lowland population of the northern islands, Spain
turned her mind to sterner work. She sent a fleet against Jolo,
rich market of the Malay East. The errand of the fleet was to
demand that the Sultan of Sulu surrender all his ammunition and
artillery and all his fighting ships, and cease trade with all
countries other than Spain; to exact control of the Sulu pearl
fisheries; to destroy all mosques; to seize and bring away all
Mohammedan priests and teachers; to denounce the doctrine of Islam
as wicked and false; to explain the heaviness of the costs incurred
by His Majesty of Spain in conveying this information; and finally,
in view of those costs, to collect a tribute of the best pearls in
hand, as an earnest of more pearls, hereafter continuously to be
produced by Sulu for the satisfaction of His Most Catholic
Majesty.</p>

<p>These demands, presented out of the blue, to a strong, old and
unconquered people, produced no fruit other than the rousing of
fierce resentment and the opening of a state of war. Continuing for
three hundred years, that conflict was to arrest the progress of
the &quot;Moro&quot; peoples, draining their strength and resources
and turning it all to arms. And it was to cost Spain herself a
great and profitless loss of men and treasure.</p>

<p>The fortunes of the struggle swung to and fro. Once and again
Spain planted her flag on Sulu soil, only to be dislodged by Moro
valour. In 1635 she secured a bare foothold, held it for nine
years, and was then forced out. Before her evacuation, however, she
effected an offensive and defensive alliance with the Sultan of
Sulu, professedly to secure peace between the two signatories, and
to insure the aid of each power to the other in case of foreign
attack.</p>

<p>Spain, in this treaty, recognized the sovereignty of the Sultan
of Sulu in his own territories of Borneo and the southern islands.
Not for two centuries thereafter did she re-establish herself on
Sulu soil.</p>

<p>Meantime, nevertheless, she hacked and worried at the lesser
towns of the Sulu coast and at the lesser dependent islands,
forever looting, burning, destroying; forever killing such life as
she could reach by means of swift raids from her hovering ships;
and sometimes storming Jolo itself. In return, the vintas of the
Sultan would surprise the Spanish ships and board them, to kill and
be killed, while other vinta fleets, darting away to the north,
raided the &quot;Christian&quot; islands and wiped out coast
settlements. To these, though her flag floated over them, Spain
could give small protection against the arms of the south. And the
ships of the Moros, returning from swift sorties to Luzon and the
Visayas, came laden with cargoes of picked women and of
boys&mdash;for they counted it too wearisome to teach the
&quot;Indian&quot; men to work. Of both they kept the best, and
sold the remainder in the markets of Borneo.</p>

<p>Raiding back and forth thus continued during the first hundred
years. Then, in 1737, Sultan Alimud Din I ratified a new treaty, in
which both Spain and Sulu again pledged themselves to mutual
assistance in time of need and to new efforts for order. Alimud Din
faithfully kept his word, doing his best to keep his people in
hand. He revised Sulu&#39;s law code and judicial system. He caused
the translation into Sulu of various Arabic books on law and
religion. And he encouraged, meantime, the use of Arabic among the
people and as the official tongue. He minted a coinage. He
instituted various social reforms, which his successors continued.
Incidentally he is the direct ancestor of all the principal Sulu
cjiiefs of to-day.</p>

<p>Nine years after Alimud Din&#39;s accession, the King of Spain
asked permission to send Jesuit missionaries to JoJo to teach the
Christian faith. This permission the Sultan gave&mdash;but with
disastrous results. For the zeal of the missionaries led to great
and greater exasperation of the people, who had not forgotten
Spain&#39;s pledge to respect their faith. At length they rose to
depose the Sultan and to drive the Jesuits out. The latter escaped
in haste, while the Sultan himself fled to Manila to ask Spanish
aid, in accordance with treaty terms.</p>

<p>At Manila Alimud Din was received with princely honour.
Triumphal arches were flung across streets lined with 2,000
men-at-arms. In the name of the King of Spain, the Governor-General
lavished upon his visitor presents of gems and silks and gold and
prepared a fine house where the Sultan and his large retinue were
entertained at the King&#39;s charge.<sup>3</sup> But a year and a
half passed before Spain saw fit to make good her treaty pledge.
Meantime the Sulus raided the northern archipelago with renewed
enthusiasm.</p>

<p class="sup"><sup>3</sup>Blair and Robertson, Vol. XLVIII, p.
150.</p>

<p>At last, in May, 1751, Spain sent an expedition to Sulu, which
negotiated terms for the return of Alimud Din. A Spanish frigate,
it was agreed, should bring the Sultan as far as Zamboanga. There
he should be met by a Sulu escort befitting his rank and brought
home.</p>

<p>All this was duly performed&mdash;excepting the essential part.
The Sulu escort, consisting of the Sultan&#39;s own young sons and
daughters, with several high dignitaries and their respective
retinues&mdash;217 persons in all&mdash;was seized by the Spaniards
on its arrival in Zamboanga and, with the Sultan himself, was
shipped off to Manila, there to be thrown into prison.</p>

<p>The news fell upon Sulu with an intolerable shock. The
people&#39;s passion of rage brought them together for better and
stronger organization, better and stronger equipment, better
fighting shape than ever they had before achieved. The whole Sulu
nation flung itself upon the islands of the north, pillaging,
destroying and carrying away captives, both Spanish and Indian, in
a series of raids of superlative daring.</p>

<p align="center"><a name="ill-21" id="ill-21"></a><img src=

<br>
TO-DAY IN THE SULU SEA</p>

<p>Then Spain, in high council at Manila, declared a real war of
extermination. To strengthen her regular troops&mdash;part Spanish,
part native&mdash;she called in the Visayan corsairs, granting them
special privileges in return for help against the south. They were
to have <i>carte blanche</i> for killing, destruction and looting,
and, provided they equipped themselves, they were to keep all the
loot. Further, they were to have or to sell, for their own profit,
all female captives, and all males under twelve and over thirty
years of age. Old people and cripples they were to kill on sight.
Males between twelve and thirty years Spain agreed to take off
their hands at from two to three dollars a head.</p>

<p>Not without reason did the courage of the Visayan outlaws need
this stimulation. And the Sulus&#39; revenge for their activities
made 1753 the most terrible year in all the fierce record. Every
part of the Visayas was ravaged by the fleets of the south and
Luzon itself paid high for Spain&#39;s broken faith and for the
hurt dealt Sulu honour. Spanish priests were cut down on sight,
towns reduced to ashes and desirable captives in thousands carried
away into slavery. In a word, Spain&#39;s sword turned back upon
herself.</p>

<p>The Sultan Alimud Din lay twelve long years in that Spanish
prison&mdash;until I763-<sup>4</sup> Then England, who had stormed
and taken Manila as an incident in her war with Spain, delivered
him from his bondage and reinstated him on his
throne.<sup>5</sup></p>

<p class="sup"><sup>4</sup> &quot;He would probably have been put
to death but it was feared that the Moros would retaliate by
slaughtering their Christian captives, who numbered some
10,000.&quot; Blair and Robertson, Vol. XLVIII, p. 165.</p>

<p class="sup"><sup>5</sup> Blair and Robertson, Vol. L, p. 43.</p>

<p>But Sulu wrath still burned. In 1769, Sulu ships swooped down
upon Manila taking captives from her streets. Raiding, with all its
grisly fruits, increased. But Jolo itself, for the interval,
enjoyed comparative peace.</p>

<p>Piracy with the Sulus was a fine art. Logically, perhaps, they
had as much right to that pastime as Spain had to harry them on
their own soil for their unswervable faith in their God, and for
their pearls. Yet it was their piracies that, in the end, broke
them.</p>

<p>For the Great Powers, in eventual rebellion, brought such
threatening pressure upon Spain either to police her seas or submit
to having it done for her, that Spain put desperate effort to the
task. In February, 1876, she attacked Jolo with a force of nine
thousand troops, partly native Filipinos officered by Spaniards,
and including one battalion of a Peninsula artillery regiment, a
company of mountain artillery, five regiments of infantry, and
ordnance and engineer troops. These were accompanied by twelve
gunboats under steam&mdash;which latter decided the day. For the
Moro had no steam craft. After heavy losses on both sides Jolo
fell.</p>

<p>But, although conquered by force, the Sulus by no means accepted
defeat. Their city occupied and heavily garrisoned by the victor,
their ruler removed, their chiefs dispersed, the people themselves
remained defiant. Loyal to their Sultan, their faith and their
country, the common people resented as an intolerable humiliation
and offence the intrusion of the stranger and infidel upon sacred
soil. Their history and their religious-civil governmental scheme
fostered in great and small alike independence of spirit, personal
dignity, self-respect, strong will, reckless bravery. Life itself
meant nothing to them, as against Islam and honour. No defeat could
bend such a people to submission.</p>

<p>Sulu had never possessed a standing army, but, of her teeming
population, every able-bodied male was a shipbuilder, a pastmaster
of sailing and a first-class fighting man, alike on land or sea. A
war such as Spain waged against them could mean only a war of
extermination.</p>

<p>Leaderless as they were, each individual man and boy now became,
by his own direction, a dynamo of vengeance. The Spanish garrison
in Jolo, for all its size, lived in terror&mdash;terror of the
individual human creatures at its back.</p>

<p>At last, after a year and a half of hopeless conflict between
the cooped-up, nerve-racked garrison and the furious and desperate
people, came a wise Spaniard, Colonel Carlos Mart&iacute;nez, as
Governor of Sulu. He, by skill and tact, and by cooperation with an
equally wise and skilful Sulu chief, Datu Harun al Rashid, arranged
with the Sultan a treaty to stop futile bloodshed.</p>

<p>This treaty, the last of many signed with Spain, and never
abrogated, secured to Sulu the free administration of all her
internal affairs, with the undisturbed enjoyment of her own laws
and all her old rights of trade. It gave the Sultan direct access
to the Spanish Governor-General of the Philippines, over the head
of warship commanders or of the Governor of Sulu. It recognized the
Sultan&#39;s privilege to collect duties from foreign vessels
outside of Jolo and to handle all Moro delinquents and criminals.
It recognized the right of all the people of Sulu to &quot;use
muzzle-loading rifles and <i>lantaka&quot;</i> (Moro-made cannon).
And&mdash;most important of all&mdash;it re-affirmed the pledge
that the customs, usages and religion of the people should be held
inviolable. It provided a fixed yearly payment from Spain to the
Sultan and to the members of the Sultan&#39;s council. It effected
the recognition, by the Sultan and his council, of Spanish
suzerainty. And it settled the status of Sulu as a protectorate of
Spain, not a dependency.</p>

<p>It was this treaty that America found in force when, in May,
1899, she took over from Spain the fortress of Jolo.</p>

<h2>Chapter XXVII &mdash; MEN&mdash;AND A CURSE</h2>

<p>Meantime, over to the east of the Sulu archipelago, among the
Moros of Mindanao, Basilan and the lesser islands, a parallel drama
had been enacted. There, during the last quarter of the sixteenth
century, Spain hectored the country, arousing fear and hatred,
killing and being killed, but making no real progress toward
occupation. Underestimating, at first, the quality of the people,
the Spanish brought to Mindanao only such &quot;forces as had
sufficed for the rapid and easy conquests of the Visayas and
Luzon.</p>

<p>In 1598, however, General Ronquillo was ordered &quot;to make a
last effort against the Mindanaos, doing them all possible
damage.&quot; Setting out from Oton, February 8, 1597, Ronquillo
sailed for the Mindanao river, meaning to proceed thereby up into
the country of the Sultan sa Maguindanao. At the river&#39;s mouth
he stopped to repair his ships and store his ammunition, then ran
up until he met the enemy&#39;s artillery outposts, where he
stopped to reconnoitre. Here, he reported: <i><sup>1</sup></i></p>

<blockquote>On the third day, as the work of reconnoitring was
proceeding, a large ambuscade of Indians attacked us in the open
near a palm-grove. As was learned later, they numbered about two
thousand. They attacked us with the greatest fury and
determination, in small bodies of skilful troops...Of a truth they
showed clearly that they were brave; for I do not believe that
there are many peoples who would attack with so gallant a
determination, when they were armed with nothing but shields and
campilans.<br>
<br>
I planted my battery of eight pieces...Although I battered the fort
hotly, I could not effect a breach through which to make an
assault. All the damage that I did them by day, they repaired by
night...I reconnoitred the fort...It is located at the entrance of
a lagoon, thus having only water at the back, and swampy and marshy
ground at the sides. It has a frontage of more than 1,000 paces, is
furnished with very good transversals, and is well supplied with
artillery and arquebuses. Moreover, it has a ditch of water more
than 4 brazas [24 feet] wide and 2 deep, and thus there was a space
of dry ground of only fifteen paces where it was possible to
attack; and this space was bravely defended...The inner parts were
water, where they sailed in vessels, while we had no footing at
all.</blockquote>

<p class="sup"><sup>1</sup> Don Juan de Ronquillo to Governor
Tello, Mindanao, 1597. Blair and Robertson, Vol. IX, pp. 284-6.</p>

<p>Under the circumstances General Ronquillo decided that to
negotiate and retire were wiser than to fight. In his subsequent
report, he added:</p>

<blockquote>These Indians are not like those in Luzon, but are
accustomed to power and sovereignty...<sup>2</sup></blockquote>

<p class="sup"><sup>2</sup>Blair and Robertson, Vol. IX, p.
289.</p>

<p>And again:</p>

<blockquote>...the inhabitants are Indians only in name&mdash;a
great force is needed, as well as much ammunition, in order to make
them pay tribute.<sup>3</sup></blockquote>

<p class="sup"><sup>3</sup> Ibid, p. 292.</p>

<p>The Jesuits, however, still pressed the Spanish government to
occupy southern Mindanao and especially to plant a fortress at
Zamboanga for the protection of their missionaries and of Christian
ships. At last, in 1635, a strong expedition actually began the
erection of a fort at Zamboanga.</p>

<p>Thus time wore on. In 1848, the progress made toward
pacification could be fairly measured by the incident of
Balan-gingi. Balangingi, an island not six miles square, lying
between Jolo and Basilan, is scarcely more than a mangrove swamp
half awash among reefs and shoals. Its inhabitants were
Sam&aacute;is&mdash;a Mohammedan sea-race that build their houses
over the water and drop from their doors to their boats.</p>

<p>Four forts, with walls of triple rows of piles containing
artillery embrasures, constituted the island&#39;s defence. The
Spaniards attacked in greatly superior force. The Moros fought
desperately. When the walls fell and the end was sure, they first
turned their krises upon their wives and children, then rushed out
to certain death from the Spanish guns. Gathering up the
loot&mdash;in this case rich&mdash;the Spaniards then proceeded
utterly to destroy all of use or value, down to the last cocoa-nut
tree, that the island contained. The Moro dead numbered about 500.
It is said that there were never any Moro wounded when a fight was
done.</p>

<p>Yet, out of pure defiance, a Samal datu renewed settlement and
built a fort on this same island within the year. And so, with
attack, defiance and rapid counterattack, the hopeless fight went
on. At last, about 1861, and chiefly by means of steam coast-guard
vessels, Spain reduced Zamboanga and Ba-silan to a sort of stormy
and intermittent acceptance.</p>

<p>None of all these activities appreciably affected either the
primeval pagan population inhabiting the interior of the island, or
the fierce and proud Lanao Moros of the lake region high in the
Mindanao hills.</p>

<p>Such were the peoples of the southern archipelago, whose destiny
fell into our hands from the broken grasp of Spain.</p>

<p>As for America&#39;s impact on the Moro mind, the Moro saw small
reason or beauty in the appearance on his horizon of a new foreign
assailant of his liberty. Sometimes he parleyed, sometimes he
fought, his women fighting at his side&mdash;together casting away
their lives. And American forces crushed these outbreaks
bloodily&mdash;perhaps also from lack of understanding of the mind
and background of the opponent&mdash;from lack of power of direct
speech or intelligent interpretation, either way.</p>

<p>But these fights had one great merit over the fights with
Spain&mdash;they were decisive.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the first men we sent out to make the beginnings of
government were of our best. Bolton, set down alone in far Davao
without troops at his back, governed seventeen fighting
tribes&mdash;governed them easily because of his even hand, his
manhood and his sympathy with the people. Stader dispensed order,
justice and humane good humour in the Sulu Sea. Febiger&#39;s name
is yet remembered with affection by the Maguindanaos. Bullard and
Pershing, at opposite ends of Lake Lanao, had each such backing
among the Moro chiefs as, for its sheer energy, almost caused a
war.</p>

<p>These and other young army officers similarly placed handled
each his own job by personal influence and prestige, by individual
touch, more or less successfully, to the best of his imagination.
They demanded order and rendered such protection as was possible.
They tried to avoid idle friction and to give no needless offence
to ancient prejudices or customs. When revolts broke out they
struck swiftly and hard. They acted as men to men. And simplicity
and justice gave the two great keynotes for all that they did.</p>

<p>The honourable and intelligent relations of these young soldiers
were the origin of the extraordinary faith in America yet held by
the Moro of to-day.</p>

<p>In 1903 we erected the whole Moro country into a &quot;Moro
Province&quot;&mdash;the largest in the Philippines. We gave it an
Organic Act, and we sent it General Leonard Wood as first civil
governor&mdash;under orders to keep peace if he could but to bring
on trouble if he must. The Government that General Wood set up was
practical, plain, quick in action, and extremely elastic. He did
everything through the head men, whom the Moros by their own law
and custom were used to trust and obey. When he punished, he
punished memorably, clearing the sky like a thunderstorm and
leaving no aftermath of grudges. He allowed the Moros to follow
their own habits and choice wherever their ideas did not conflict
with American vital principles&mdash;as they did in the question of
slavery.</p>

<p>And, where he could, he made use of his personal advantage. For
example:</p>

<p>Up among the La&ntilde;aos, where the men still look like Old
Testament heroes, where the earth is tilled like a garden, where
the houses of the aristocrats are beautifully carven, where
armourers and jewellers excel, live many chieftains, each
recognizing as higher than himself none but Allah and the Sultan of
Stamboul. They are like heads of the fighting Highland clans in the
days of Wallace and of Bruce. Each lives in his own stronghold, his
people in arms about him&mdash;anywhere from fifty to a thousand
men. Each maintains his priest and his tutor for his sons. Each,
when he goes forth to fight, shuts his women and his cattle into
his fort for protection from his antagonists. And each would die a
thousand deaths rather than cede a point of religion, of custom or
of pride.</p>

<p>One day, after General Wood had served for some time as civil
governor of the Moro Province and had become well-known to its
people, a long cable message came through from the Colonel of an
infantry regiment just newly arrived at Camp Keithley, the Federal
post at Lanao. The Sultan of Uatu, said the Colonel, was reported
to have acquired some slaves. The Colonel had sent to the Sultan
demanding the slaves and an explanation. With outrageous firmness
the Sultan had answered that he was giving neither. The Colonel,
therefore, was preparing an expedition with troops to wipe the
Sultan out, which expedition would start as quickly as
possible.</p>

<p>General Wood read the message without enthusiasm. In the next
breath he dictated an answer. But now the cable refused to work. In
the few moments between the reception of the Colonel&#39;s message
and the General&#39;s attempted reply, an earthquake had happened
along and wrecked the wire.</p>

<p>&quot;McCoy,&quot; said the General to his aide. &quot;Get
yourself out to Lanao, hot foot, and save our old friend the
Sultan.&quot;</p>

<p>So it happened that the officer who is now Brigadier-General
Frank McCoy of brilliant history, proceeding from Zamboanga
barracks to Lanao at the velocity indicated, touched Camp Keithley
on the very hour of the expedition&#39;s departure. In General
Wood&#39;s name, he ordered a halt pending negotiations. Then he
sent word to the Sultan of Uatu as to an interview.</p>

<p align="center"><a name="ill-22" id="ill-22"></a><img src=

<br>
DATU RAJAH MUDA MANDI WITH KAMLIYA, HIS WIFE</p>

<p>Back came the answer: The Sultan would come anywhere to see Datu
McCoy, excepting to Camp Keithley. The American there was the
Sultan&#39;s enemy.</p>

<p>&quot;Datu McCoy,&quot; therefore, left camp and, quite by
himself, moved over into the open country. Thither came the old
Chief, eager to pour out his tale and ready and glad to hear, to
concede, and also to do anything on earth that his good friend Datu
Wood might wish. But nothing at all, he affirmed, would he do for
that mannerless upstart at Keithley.</p>

<p>And so was settled, to everybody&#39;s satisfaction and to the
strengthening of friendship, what had nearly cost the lives of an
unknowable number of American soldiers and of a whole Moro clan,
besides starting a new grievance.</p>

<p>The clashes that came were sometimes violent and costly and
never wholly ceased. But more and more the Moros submitted to a
hand that in the main they recognized as just as well as strong,
meting out benefits or penalties according to deserts.</p>

<p>And, as had happened before, a man of honour, patience, tact,
and intelligent good-will being found to approach the Moro, the
Moro met that man in kind. Thus, General Wood&#39;s policy and
personal bearing toward the Moros of Mindanao drew forth on their
part a remarkable character&mdash;Datu Rajah Muda
Mandi,<sup>4</sup> the most influential chief those parts had ever
known. Of him Dr. N. M. Saleeby, scientist and scholar, who has
earned by long and fruitful years of study in the Moro country a
right to credence, writes: <sup>5</sup></p>

<p class="sup"><sup>4</sup> Cf., p. 277 ante.</p>

<p class="sup"><sup>5</sup> Najeeb M. Saleeby, <i>History of
Sulu,</i> Manila, pp. 252, <b>263.</b></p>

<blockquote>A close observation of Datu Mandi&#39;s ability and
attitude toward the Government renders it clear that the influence
this man could bring to bear on his people was immense...There
never existed a Moro chief more tactful, pliable, forceful and
favourable to the reorganization of the Moro community and its
system of government along modern and civilized lines.</blockquote>

<p>The help of one such personage surpassed in effectiveness an
army. A word from him brought to pass with certainty and speed
things for which troops would have killed and been killed in
vain.</p>

<p>On the firm foundation of friendliness, service and mutual good
faith that General Wood then laid, his successors as civil
Governors of the province built. Through these days great Moros
named their sons &quot;Wood,&quot; and &quot;Scott&quot; and
&quot;Bliss&quot; and &quot;Pershing.&quot; And poor Moros called
their sons &quot;Dooley,&quot; &quot;Tompkins&#39;&quot; or
whatever epithet described their particular friends in the
ranks.</p>

<p>It was in 1911 that General Pershing, then Governor, asked the
Moro chieftains to give up their fire-arms.<sup>6</sup></p>

<p class="sup"><sup>6</sup> Executive Order No. 24, Government of
the Moro Province, September 8, 1911.</p>

<p>&quot;How then,&quot; asked the Sultan and the datus, amazed,
&quot;how then should we defend ourselves against our
enemies?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Who are your enemies?&quot; asked the Governor.</p>

<p>&quot;The people of the north&mdash;the Filipinos&mdash;they who
have been our slaves since time began&mdash;whom the Spanish
brought to fight against us&mdash;whom America has now strengthened
and armed&mdash;who hate us and fear us to the marrow of their
bones &mdash;the little Filipinos are indeed our enemies.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Who would dare make war on you?&quot; came the answer.
&quot;Is not the shield of America held above you? Whoever should
attack you would thereby attack her.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But will America always remain with us? Will America
always be our friend and protect us?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;America will protect you always.&quot;</p>

<p>Yet still the datus hesitated.</p>

<p>&quot;Why do you hang back? Which is it you
question:&mdash;America&#39;s strength, or her honour? If you trust
her, give me the guns.&quot;</p>

<p>So, though from heavy hearts, the datus&#39; word went forth,
over the seas, into the mountains and the jungle, up the long
rivers, out among the lakes. And from near and far, by rising
thousands, the precious guns came in. Some were held back, through
invincible fear and doubt. Yet each American commandant of a remote
outpost became the recipient of many weapons, freely surrendered,
for faith in our word.</p>

<p>By the latter part of 1913, the disarmament of the Moros, not
only of guns but of fighting knives and spears, was practically
complete.</p>

<p>Meantime, in October, 1913, Mr. Harrison reached the Philippines
as Governor-General. And he, the Moros being then as nearly
helpless as man could make them, started in with despatch to
&quot;Filipinize&quot; the Moro territories.</p>

<p>It will not be necessary to trace the sequel step by step. Mr.
Harrison&#39;s object was to prove the homogeneity of the entire
population of the Philippine Islands&mdash;and to prove it at any
cost&mdash;by force if not otherwise demonstrable. The entire
population must appear to be a single people&mdash;demanding
Independence with one voice.</p>

<p>Therefore the Organic Law of the Moro Province was now
discarded, the general law of the Islands was applied&mdash;and
trouble began.</p>

<p>Trouble would have rolled up faster but for the character of the
first Governor under the new order&mdash;Mr. Frank W. Carpenter, an
experienced and tactful American able to salvage all possible good
out of the situation, able to persuade the Moros to many
concessions to which they could not have been forced. But no
administrator, however able, could alter the general trend of the
new policy&mdash;in due course of which the whole Moro country was
split up into a set of little provinces, each with its separate
governor and officialdom, and all operating under a system
absolutely incomprehensible as well as abhorrent to the people
concerned.</p>

<p>Under the discarded Organic Law, an a-b-c government using
Tribal Ward Courts and other elastic channels familiar and
acceptable to the people was gradually building up good will and
confidence, gradually bringing about a peaceful state of mind,
gradually getting land titles cleared, gradually effacing
inter-clan feuds, gradually introducing schools and gradually
stopping the habit of killings. Justice, meantime, was rapidly and
cleanly administered. The people were spared the confusion and
irritation of many taxes. Government ran on next to nothing. A
small poll tax, plus customs receipts, plus an insignificant sum
from the Insular Treasury, not only paid expenses but served to
build roads and other public improvements as well. Slowly but
steadily the people were responding &mdash;coming up.</p>

<p>But the application of the general laws of the Island, full of
twists and entanglements, heavy with masses of red tape and
paper-work, at once developed the inevitable. The Moros&#39;
training had not fitted them to handle anything of the kind.
Filipino mestizos therefore, could be plausibly poured in, to fill
the new offices. Carpet-bagging in its most vicious form began,
spread and flourished. A preposterous overhead quickly piled up.
Little districts that, by the Organic Law, were progressing
reasonably under one American administrator with the help of two
assistants, now fretted and chafed under a third-rate Filipino
governor surrounded by seventy-odd <i>ilustrado</i> clerks. The
revenue was consumed in salaries. Appropriations from the Insular
Treasury went the same way. The building of public works
practically ceased. The people were vexed and puzzled by a growing
mass of strange imposts, for which they got no return&mdash;except
more clerks with more salaries. Taxes on wells, taxes on graves,
taxes on picking up an armful of firewood on the beach, taxes on
cutting one&#39;s own timber, more than the timber was worth, taxes
on killing one&#39;s own cattle, taxes on digging a hole, taxes on
the little row of stakes that the poor man sets in the shallows of
the river in front of his hut to enclose a space of water perhaps
two by three yards square, in which his babies may bathe safe from
crocodiles. Taxes, in a word, on any act or any object that might
flit across the fancy of a little official wanting funds.</p>

<p>But the general atmosphere may better be felt through one
Moro&#39;s words:</p>

<p>&quot;In the beginning of this thing, none could understand.
Datu Wood was far away in his own country, preparing his tribes for
a war. None could consult his wisdom now. Day by day, the Americans
left us and Filipinos stepped into their places. We Moros could not
understand. Our hearts were troubled and our heads hurt. Each clan
herded apart in its own place, stricken with doubt and fear and
misgivings&mdash;like men astray by night in an enemy&#39;s
country, listening in the dark.</p>

<p>&quot;Our Moro country, we heard, was to be our country no more,
but Filipino country&mdash;governed by Filipino law. A pack of
little scribes and clerks and deputies who had sat in the American
schools in the north till their sharp slaves&#39; wits and their
glib slaves&#39; tongue had learned a mass of writing and of
chatter too hard for any Moro to comprehend, swarmed in to rule our
land. And the strong and steady hand of the Americans, our friends,
was replaced by the uneasy clutch of the slave a-horseback, in
whose mind hatred and vengeance worked with ancient fear.</p>

<p>&quot;Thus came the Scourge of Harrison.</p>

<p>&quot;In those days persecutions began, wrought in secret and
covered with fine words. Cruelties and humiliations inflicted
through orders that no man could grasp. And no longer were the
datus of the Moros interpreters of the orders to their people. No
one interpreted. Only, the Constabulary punished when the mysteries
were not performed. And the Constabulary itself was fallen low. For
its American officers had hurried away to a War&mdash;that distant
War for which Datu Wood was making ready his tribes&mdash;and into
their places, too, the little Filipinos stepped, with small hearts
steeped in gall. And these did not seek their purpose straight,
like men, but crept cowards&#39; ways, with bitter cunning pushing
Islam toward sheer suicide through rage and shame.</p>

<p>&quot;For if I have no weapon but this you see&mdash;my short
work-knife&mdash;while my enemy has guns that kill at half a mile,
is it battle, or is it suicide if I begin the fight?</p>

<p>&quot;Yet the odds were greater far than that. For the guns were
protected by America. Whoever raised his head against the
Constabulary, or any word of theirs, raised it against America. So
much every Moro understood, and, believing that the woes now heavy
upon us had come not by America&#39;s treachery, but rather because
her eyes were averted for a space, we would not risk her wrath till
we were sure. These many years she had been our friend. Her honour
and her justice we had proved. Now she was busy with far wars.
Surely her envoy in Manila must be abusing her faith. Let the Moro
then keep faith, endure in patience and wait for America to turn
again and remember her word. What had she pledged when she asked us
for our guns?</p>

<p>&quot;But to endure grew daily harder. And many men, indeed,
took their households in their vintas and departed into Borneo,
seeking the known protection of the British flag. For both we and
our fathers have seen that justice abides thereunder. And, by every
sign, it was here the set intent to goad disarmed Islam into
scattered outbreaks and revolts&mdash;that, here a family, there a
clan, by easy stages, the guns of the Constabulary might shoot them
down.</p>

<p>&quot;Also ships came from the north bringing loads of Filipinos
to whom were allotted ground. And when, again and yet again, these
people, poorest of their kind and brought in droves, like cattle,
without price or effort of their own, were spilled on the land, the
dullest of the Moros saw all too clearly what was meant. We were to
be written down outnumbered, in our own country. They said they
wanted intermarriages. But well they know no Moro will take a
Filipino for his wedded wife.</p>

<p>&quot;Since the beginning of the world we have dominated our
part of Mindanao and all the multitude of the southern isles. We
have owned it as Americans own America or as China is owned by the
Chinese. The Spaniards did, in truth, try weakly to bring the
slaves to settle here; and in latter peaceful days yet others crept
in to prey upon the timid folk of the inner hills. [The pagan
tribes.] Yet they are foreigners all&mdash;all these
visayas&mdash;these slaves&mdash;these Filipinos&mdash;intruders on
Islam&#39;s ancient birthright.</p>

<p>&quot;All land is Allah&#39;s. And nothing in the Koran shows
that taxes may be paid to any man. But now the new law says that
land-taxes must be paid, and back land-taxes, and taxes for
ever-multiplying other things&mdash;all at rates so various that
any child must perceive in him who gathers the taxes him who
invents their size. A man might be ordered to pay two pesos or
fifty pesos for the same matter. And, if he rebels, he takes the
chance of the jungle trail with the hungry rifle of an enemy at his
back.</p>

<p>&quot;And while he treads that trail, he knows his women at home
lie at the mercy of the Constabulary men&mdash;the little Filipino
Constabulary men!</p>

<p>&quot;To Islam, all the world knows, the honour of women is
sacred. The penalty of sin is death. And this, taken with the hate
and the lewdness of our enemy, gives him his dearest
chance.&quot;</p>

<a name="ch-28" id="ch-28"></a>
<h2>Chapter XXVIII &mdash; &quot;WE STAY WITH
AMERICA&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</h2>

<p>Space forbids a detailed description of this period. What
happened in the north happened in the south, but with virulence
enormously increased by the virility of the southern
population.</p>

<p>The Moro is wont to speak of time not by years but by named
intervals. Thus the interval from 1913 to 1921 is commonly
designated by the Moro to-day as &quot;the Scourge of
Harrison.&quot;</p>

<p>In the midst of it Governor Carpenter was practically withdrawn
and his place taken by a typical Filipino cacique. The
Constabulary, now almost wholly officered by Filipinos, became in
effect a provocative body, pitted against the helpless Moro
population. The attitude of the small Filipino government officials
everywhere saddled upon the people was treacherous, greedy and
vindictive. Laws and regulations multiplied like flies on a
dung-heap&mdash;and the poorest and remotest Moro, who had no
chance of hearing of the laws, who could not have understood the
laws even if he had heard them, since they were not given in his
language, was fined, manhandled and persecuted for every smallest
omission or commission. Let him resist on the spot, and on the spot
he paid the penalty with his life. Let him appeal to
justice&mdash;and &quot;justice&quot; wore him out, body, soul and
means, with summonses to court, meaning long and costly journeys;
with deferred trials, meaning months wasted in costly idleness and
summonses renewed, while his family lay exposed to attack, while
his crops went to ruin and while some little carpet-bagger,
manufacturing a pretext, jumped his land.</p>

<p>And yet, through it all, the Moro held to his trust in America.
In no point perhaps does he show difference from the Christian
Filipino more clearly than in this&mdash;that his mind could so
receive and keep the impress of America&#39;s honest men &mdash;and
that against all appearance he could hold fast to what amounted to
an abstract ideal through sufferings and humiliation such as Spain
at her worst had never been able to inflict.</p>

<p>Many things of many sorts illustrate this characteristic. One of
them was the Moro response to the Liberty Loans.</p>

<p>Here, in preface, it may be said that the Moro head men
everywhere came forward promptly, with a conviction and a
liberality in strong contrast to the conduct of the cacique of the
north. But the amazing thing was the response, man by man, of the
Moro common people. For example:</p>

<p>In the little island of Cagayan Sulu&mdash;a place where a peso
looks as large as the moon&mdash;the population numbered about
5,000. On the pledge and request of the American Government these
islanders had handed over all their arms&mdash;800 rifles and their
fighting knives. A few years later, while their consequent
sufferings were worsening day by day, they were told that America
being at war needed their help. And those few people, at the word,
laid hold upon their tiny hordes and subscribed a sum that must
indeed have &quot;hurt.&quot;</p>

<p>Again, in the Cotabato region word went forth that America asked
the Moros&#39; aid. Thousands of poor Moros, each carrying his few
coins, came streaming in from remotest places to put their money
down&mdash;&quot;for America, our friend.&quot; Some fifty thousand
pesos&mdash;twenty-five thousand dollars&mdash;was the total of the
Cotabato Moros&#39; contribution. &quot;It was indeed an enormous
sum to raise from such a source,&quot; to quote the man who
collected it, &quot;but they wanted to know only one
thing&mdash;that it was indeed America, not the Filipinos, who
would have their treasure.&quot;</p>

<p>Yet still the evils grew without relief&mdash;a tale of shame.
Until at last, in the spring of the eighth year, came one sharp ray
of light to cleave the bitter blackness: Rumour of the Wood-Forbes
Commission abroad in the world.</p>

<p>Becoming immediately personal, as happens in Moro-Iand, the
tidings took this guise:</p>

<p>&quot;Allah has heard us. Datu Wood is coming back. Bad days are
done.&quot;</p>

<p>And when the Commission reached Lanao, in the mid-summer of
1921, it found the datus and their people gathered in strength
eagerly waiting. Gravely, with burning eyes, they stood up, turn by
turn, and gave their evidence&mdash;a hard sum total for Americans
to hear, in a land &quot;protected&quot; by America. In climax each
man solemnly affirmed his unalterable desire and that of his people
that America remember her pledge and return to them, to govern them
forever under the American flag. Explicitly, they did not wish to
govern themselves, having found, through America&#39;s early help,
that they did better under her care. Finally:&mdash;Rather than be
ruled by Filipinos they would assuredly all die.</p>

<p>&quot;We hear the <i>visayas&#39;</i> talk,&quot; they said,
&quot;of &#39;Philippines for the Filipinos.&#39; If that be just,
then why shall not the Moros&#39; country be for the Moros? The
Filipino, as our writings show, has never dared to show his face
among us except as a slave or a convict or as brought and protected
by some foreign power. The land, under Allah, has been Islam&#39;s
these many hundred years. By what sort of right are we now bound
hand and foot and delivered, unarmed, into the hands of strangers
and enemies?</p>

<p>&quot;Stay with us. Take away this cursed Filipino Constabulary
and we will pledge our word upon the Koran before our priests that
we, the datus, will bring in all men who commit crime; also that
there will be no revolt nor any opposition to any laws, so long as
the laws be laws imposed by Americans and carried out by American
officers.</p>

<p>&quot;We know that America is just. We have proved her justice.
And she beat us in honourable war. We submitted, having fought our
best and being truly beaten by better men than we. Our Koran says
there is no shame in that. So now America is our Father and our
Mother according to our laws. And we have trusted her. And when we
knew that Datu Wood was coming back at last, our hearts were lifted
up to Allah in praise.&quot;</p>

<p>The Commission, having heard the datus and their people behind
them, passed on its way. And one by one, soon and steadily, the
chief of those who dared so to testify before it or to sign the
pro-American petition that the datus had presented, were
slain&mdash;picked off by Constabulary guns.</p>

<p>Not openly for that offence, but for pretexts, as pretexts
arose. Any little thing.</p>

<p>Or, if you sufficiently break a Moro&#39;s heart, he, being
practically weaponless, will invite you to come and kill him. Then,
putting on a fine white robe newly sewn by his wife for that
day&#39;s wear, he will walk out upon your row of Springfields to
be shot.</p>

<p>What has been practised in Filipinized Lanao is near enough to
murder to make the word turn pale. And what has been practised in
Lanao is fully matched, point for point, in other parts of the
unhappy Moro territory.</p>

<p>Now to account more particularly for the state of that once
justly famous body, the Constabulary:</p>

<p>Organized in 1903 by General J. G. Harbord, the Constabulary of
the Moro country was originally enlisted chiefly from Moros
themselves and officered by young Americans from the regular army.
It was then a fine, loyal and exceedingly useful instrument for
inducing law and order among the Moro people. But, instantly
Filipinization began, the Constabulary became its prime target.
First the red fez was debarred&mdash;pride and distinction of the
service. Then the Moro enlisted personnel was rapidly pushed out
and its places filled by Filipinos. Meantime Filipinos, as has
already been said, replaced the American officers.</p>

<p>Thus was created an organization whose tone has become not only
lax but undeniably inimical to the people over which it is set, an
organization by law in part under the Governor-General, but
actually under the influence of the politico forces at Manila, to
which it looks for rewards.</p>

<p>Working fairly creditably in Christian Filipino country, the
Constabulary among the Moros is to-day a curse&mdash;a curse that
would be blacker but for the sadly impeded efforts of the rare
remaining American officers. The Filipino Constabulary officer in
Moro districts often combines in his single person the powers of
deputy governor, justice of the peace, public prosecutor, jailer
and collector of poll-taxes as well as maker of arrests. The strain
is more than he can bear.</p>

<p>Things thus moved on, without possibility of change for the
better, well into the second year of Governor-General Wood&#39;s
administration. Yet, although the hand of the Filipino was heavy,
the Moros as a whole managed to keep themselves in check.</p>

<p>&quot;We will be good,&quot; they said again and again,
&quot;and wait the day of Datu Wood. We know he will not
forget.&quot;</p>

<p>To them, you see, &quot;Datu Wood&quot; means America.</p>

<p>And then while in Manila was brewing the Big Caciques&#39;
declaration of war&mdash;the &quot;Crisis&quot;&mdash;came Quezon
himself&mdash;greatly daring, up into Lanao to make a speech. In
June, 1923, he made that speech to the assembled chiefs and people.
And his judgment signally failed him there. For he fell into two
errors: He attacked the Moros&#39; friend and he threatened the
Moro people&mdash;threatened them with &quot;grave
consequences.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;America&#39;s day is done,&quot; he said in effect, by
report of many hearers. &quot;Her government in the Philippines
to-day is a fable. It is the Filipino Legislature that governs you
Moros. This man Wood is a figurehead. It is only a question of a
little time and every American in the Islands will be chased out.
You Moros will do well to submit to us now.&quot;</p>

<p>As he uttered the words, one old datu fainted dead away, falling
where he stood. The rest rose to the challenge as one man. Whatever
effect such words might have had upon a Filipino audience, to an
audience of Moros they came like oil to fire. Seeing America
attacked, seeing their friend attacked, they stood up straight
before the assailant and defied him to his face. It was the
response to the Liberty Loan over again and in far costlier
form&mdash;for this&mdash;and they knew it&mdash;was to cost them
their lives.</p>

<p>Chief among the spokesmen was the strongest man in Lanao, Ami
Binaning. Frank, intelligent, direct as an Anglo-Saxon, he had been
the first of the datus to send his boys to school, the first to pay
his taxes, the greatest help to the American government, the best
and most powerful influence for law and order in the region. And
his feeling against the cutting loose of the Moro countries from
America had been from the first outspoken and extreme. On the visit
of the Wood-Forbes Commission he had declared with emphasis to that
effect. &quot;Let the Filipinos go where they will. But they shall
not govern us. And we Moros will stay under America. Give us the
American flag,&quot; he had said. Now, in Quezon&#39;s teeth, and
with the Filipino Constabulary hedging him round about he repeated
his declaration. &quot;You shall not govern us. We stay with
America.&quot;</p>

<p>Quezon listened, smiling.</p>

<p>&quot;Go ahead and talk now, all of you,&quot; he rejoined, they
say. &quot;Soon there will be neither American government nor
American men here. And then, you friends of America, you&mdash;had
better clear off to the hills.&quot;</p>

<p>As he ceased speaking the datus went straight out and pulled
down the Filipino flag, wherever they found it, leaving the Stars
and Stripes to fly alone.</p>

<p>For it is the custom in Philippine government places to fly the
Filipino flag and the American flag together.</p>

<p>Shortly thereafter a young son of Ami Binaning came down from
Lanao with a message from his father to a certain American living
on the coast.</p>

<p>&quot;It seems that my days are soon done,&quot; that message
ran. &quot;I will not longer risk staying in my house, which has
already been shot up. I am going with my family into the hills. It
is because of my words to Quezon&mdash;of which I shall retract
nothing. This is to assure you of my good friendship, and if, as I
think, the Constabulary kill me soon, to say good-bye.&quot;</p>

<p>The mere fact that he did so withdraw furnished their pretext.
He had become a rebel they said&mdash;had gone on the warpath.</p>

<p>The refuge he chose was an abandoned and ruinous stockade
standing on a little hill in the wilderness, where a tumbledown
shack offered shelter. There he led his family&mdash;three young
men, two women and a little child. There, as soon as they had
tracked him, came the Filipino Constabulary, some twenty strong.
And when they had closely surrounded the place, Ami Binaning, with
his only weapon&mdash;his little short-bladed work-knife in his
hand&mdash;for he would not die unarmed &mdash;Ami Binaning walked
out, with his boys at his side, and came before them. And so they
shot him down. Also, they shot and killed the unarmed boys and the
women and the little child. Without any pretext of battle, or
excuse of women fighting. For no one fought at all. They had
nothing to fight with.</p>

<p>They simply died&mdash;for honour and for America.</p>

<h2>Chapter XXIX &mdash; BUT, YES, WE&#39;LL HAVE NO BANANAS</h2>

<p>After the killing of Ami Binaning matters grew rapidly worse.
The Lanao Moros felt a weight of personal loss. All Moros believed
that so conspicuous a murder was intended as an emphasis of
Quezon&#39;s threatening speech. They resented the affront to
America&mdash;and speculated uneasily as to how it came that such
an affront could be dared. Was America fallen upon evil days of
weakness and decay&mdash;an old watch-dog grown blind and deaf and
toothless? Was the end of the world at hand?</p>

<p>And then, as if planned as a spark to gunpowder, came the next
move. It took the shape of an identical letter addressed to the
<i>presidentes</i> of municipalities, signed by Teodoro M. Kalaw,
Secretary of the Filipino Commission of Independence in Manila.</p>

<p>Under date of August 22, 1923, the document read in part:</p>

<blockquote>Unless we are mistaken, the next Congress will again
see a battle royal between the supporters of Philippine
Independence and the advocates of retention. I...point out to you
and to the Municipal Council...the necessity and convenience that
the Council approve, as soon as possible, a resolution expressing
faithfully and sincerely its views and desires regarding the future
political status of our country. Such a resolution is absolutely
necessary...as the enemies of our cause are engaged in spreading
the news that independence is desired only by a few Filipinos, and
that a great majority of our people prefer the continuance of
American sovereignty...</blockquote>

<p>When this letter, carefully phrased, but with an unequivocal
implication, became known among the Lanao Moros, they understood it
to mean that the Filipinos had declared war on the United States.
And at that, almost to a man, they proclaimed themselves for
America to the finish&mdash;they with no guns, surrounded by armed
enemies.</p>

<p>Fire flashed all down the ranks. Young chiefs came out, each
with fifty to a hundred men at his back and swore on the Koran
before their priests&mdash;the unbreakable oath&mdash;to die
fighting. Poor men and women on their individual initiative did the
equivalent. For this, it is testified, some were dragged under the
staff of the flag they declared for, ordered to look up to it,
since they liked it so much, and then clubbed with rifle butts.
Others were punished in other ways. After which, such as remained
alive repeated just what they had said before. One whole village
was killed off at this time. And, with few exceptions throughout
the Moro country, such Filipino officials as up to now had seemed
to aim at justice so suddenly slacked off that the theory of chance
coincidence in the trend of events grew day by day less
tenable.</p>

<hr class="short">

<p>Now to speak in particular of the Zamboanga region:&mdash;The
town of Zamboanga stands alone&mdash;a unique case. Its core is the
old Spanish fort. Around that fort lie the military barracks, once
headquarters of the American Governors of the Moro Province, now
given over to a detachment of Scouts. Hugging the barracks, again,
crowds the little modern town, with a population chiefly
Filipino.</p>

<p>These Filipinos have sprung in the main from a nearby prison set
up in earlier days to take the overflow from Bilibid. The prison,
in its turn, disgorged its graduates upon the land. And the
convicts thus released&mdash;for the most part foreigners on an
unwelcoming soil&mdash;naturally huddled for cover as closely as
possible under the guns of the Spanish fortress, there making their
settlement. In later days&mdash;days of
Filipinization&mdash;Filipino clerks and officeholders implanted in
numbers have been added to their compatriots in Zamboanga
town.<sup>1</sup> Around the alien islet so constructed the native
Moro population spreads off and away over land and sea.</p>

<p class="sup"><sup>1</sup> Further, Zamboanga to-day has its small
American and European element&mdash;chiefly bank people,
vice-consulate staffs and the staffs of trading firms&mdash;and its
Chinese store-keepers. Taken together, exclusive of Filipinos,
these pay 98 per cent of the internal revenue and 94 per cent of
all taxes. They have, however, no representation on the municipal
board and no voice either as to assessment rates, which have
sometimes been quintupled for Americans, or as to the disposition
of the taxes collected. Since Filipinization taxes have doubled,
improvements have practically stopped, and public property and
public utilities alike are falling toward decay.</p>

<p>It was this islet, with its scattering offshoots, that, in 1922,
put into office the first elected Governor of Zamboanga
Province,<sup>2</sup> a young Filipino <i>ilustrado</i> named
Saguin&mdash;a quaint little figure perched like a toy on the chair
that General Pershing once found none too small.</p>

<p class="sup"><sup>2</sup> In this year four
provinces&mdash;Zamboanga, Agusan and Davao in Mindanao, and Nueva
Viscaya in Luzon, for the first time elected their governors by the
vote of the people. The percentage of voters averaged about 5 per
cent of the population.</p>

<p>In the beginning Saguin to all appearances was the best local
Filipino that could have been chosen&mdash;really anxious to do
good work. But it would have been unfair to expect him to develop
character and resistance strong enough to keep on the rails, with
the pressure from Manila rushing up as it did in the autumn of
1923. From the autumn of 1923 Governor Saguin began to travel
sidewise and to become, to his credit be it said, an uncomfortable
young man.</p>

<p>By December he had already sand-bagged his record, except as a
politico tool, and the Moros, who with their soothsayer&#39;s gaze
look any man through to his farthest side, knew exactly his weight
and his measure. Which was why they took him in part as a joke.</p>

<p>On December 31st&mdash;Rizal Day<sup>3</sup>&mdash;1923,
Zamboanga town, obedient to Manila&#39;s orders, held a
parade&mdash;a demonstration with banners, aimed against
subservience to America, against General Wood, and in especial
against the segregation of the Moro country as a United States
Territory, which idea is cherished by Moro hearts.</p>

<p class="sup"><sup>3</sup> A holiday invented by Mr. Taft during
his goyernor-generalcy, as an effort to create public spirit among
the Christian Filipinos. Mr. Taft&#39;s idea was that if a national
hero could be given them, a much-needed ideal might, in time, grow
up around that name. No Filipino was thus known to the people. Mr.
Taft, in consultation with the best available advice, decided,
therefore, to pick out Jos&eacute; Rizal, executed by Spain in 1896
for sedition, and, by a deliberate publicity campaign, artificially
to create him the Filipino hero. This was accordingly done.</p>

<p>All this they might have done without arousing counteraction.
But when, in posing the head of their column to be photographed in
the public square, they deliberately planted Moro figures as
apparent leaders in the forefront of the crowd, they touched a live
wire.</p>

<p>The onlooking Moros drew apart for council.</p>

<p>&quot;We must instantly make a parade of our own. We too must
wear tags, carry placards and be photographed,&quot; they decided;
&quot;we can&#39;t let this thing stand alone.&quot;</p>

<p>So some rushed to buy card-board&mdash;with their own money, be
it observed&mdash;while others sat down to devise mottoes and build
placards. Meantime three boys who had learned to print in Bishop
Brent&#39;s school dashed off to hire the school press.</p>

<p>Those three volunteer printers, toiling at the press, turned out
eleven hundred tags. Then the material gave out, although Moros
long after came flocking, begging for tags, under the impression
that tag-wearing, somehow, would help the cause.</p>

<p>With the speed of high excitement the work was finished, and
when, on the afternoon of the same day, the Moro parade advanced
through the town, every marcher who could get a tag wore a tag
proclaiming his mind.</p>

<p>And so this counter-procession wound round and round the town
and its suburbs. Every soul who could lay hands on such a prize
carried an American flag. At their head swept one big American
flag, carried by a man with a fez. Beside the standard moved a
large white placard, the paint yet wet, hand-printed in English and
reading:</p>

<p align="center">We Are Not Ungrateful<br>
To the United States<br>
The Voices of the Moros<br>
Are Not Heard in Manila<br>
Except by Our Friend<br>
General Wood</p>

<p align="center"><a name="ill-23" id="ill-23"></a><img src=
"0300901h-images/0300901h-23.jpg" alt="0300901h-23.jpg"><br>
<br>
BUT, YES, WE&#39;LL HAVE NO BANANAS!</p>

<p>A twin sign flanked it, written in Spanish, translating
thus:</p>

<p align="center">Luzon and Visayas for<br>
The Filipinos<br>
Mindanao, Sulu, for<br>
The Moros<br>
Long Live General Wood.</p>

<p>And then came another touch of that Moro humour so curiously
un-Filipino, so curiously Anglo-Saxon. To explain, it must be
prefaced that the word &quot;saguin,&quot; which is the name of the
Filipino governor of the province, means &quot;banana.&quot;</p>

<p>Slowly rolling in the lead of the procession moved a single
automobile containing three datus of the first rank&mdash;men
perhaps thirty years old. And these three, as they reached the
Government Building, flung the whole of their lusty voices into one
burst of clearly enunciated song.</p>

<p align="center">&quot;But, yes, we&#39;ll have no bananas,<br>
We&#39;ll have no bananas to-day.&quot;</p>

<p>Then on they swung, gently economizing their lungs in the
interlude, to launch interminably into a full-throated roar on
reaching the classic refrain.</p>

<p>Saguin, in his turn characteristically, saw nothing funny about
the performance, but writhed under the shrieks of the enchanted
crowd. On the morrow, it is said, he issued an order imposing a
fine of nine pesos upon any Moro who should again sing the song.
But this is as it may be.</p>

<p>In any case, the three malicious young datus were convinced that
the inward power of the banana song, which they had but just
discovered and learned, was revealed to them by their kindly genii
that day.</p>

<p>Humour enough floats in the field&mdash;as, for example, that
unwittingly afforded by Mr. J. S. Alano, Filipino politico of
Zamboanga, when recently asked:</p>

<p>&quot;Why, then, if you Filipinos really want Independence,
don&#39;t you work for it for yourselves, and let the Moros keep
their own country as they choose to have it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Impossible!&quot; came the protest reported. &quot;Why,
that would mean America ruling in Mindanao and Sulu. Then all our
northern people would move down here right away&mdash;and whom
would we, in Manila, have left to govern?&quot;</p>

<p>But life in the main is tragic in the south, and full of
sinister portent. The Moro Parade in Zamboanga brought evil fruits,
one of which was a hasty campaign on the part of the Filipinos to
gather Moro signatures for Independence petitions. The methods
first employed were directed at barrio officials.</p>

<p>The appointment of barrio presidents and lieutenants had been
necessitated in Moro land by the application of the general law of
the Islands. And where none but Moros lived, or desired to live,
such appointees, naturally, must be Moros. In Zamboanga, Filipino
agents now toured the Province, demanding of all Moro barrio
officials that they sign Independence petitions. On their refusal,
almost all were at once removed from office and the district left
as a rule without local government,&mdash;for the reason that not
one Moro could be found who would sign the paper. Or, where some
individual could be so persuaded, his standing and quality was such
that the people refused him obedience.</p>

<p>This method proving barren, the workers adopted another plan. On
any pretext they collected signatures&mdash;long sheets of
signatures or of thumb marks, affixed to blank paper. And in this,
because of the means they used, they were at the start successful.
But few Moros of position could be so caught; almost at once even
the simplest folk became too suspicious to be handled except by
force; and soon a sort of general panic set in as to what might be
afoot in the dark.</p>

<p>Now, it is indicative of the nature of the Moros and of their
difference from the Christian Filipino, tao or cacique, that in
this crux the common people often acted for themselves. Not a few
wrote letters to Governor-General Wood in the endeavour to offset a
false use of their names by trick or forgery. These letters, they
later came to believe, were mostly stopped in the mails, never
reaching their destination.</p>

<p>Meantime by hundreds, other poor Moros flocked to
Al-varez&mdash;Alvarez, the only American in all the Province who
dared listen to their woes and give them counsel in their need.</p>

<p>&quot;I never know how many I shall find waiting at my house
when I go home at night,&quot; he told me,
&quot;ten&mdash;fifty&mdash;a hundred&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>And often I, who write, found them there&mdash;strange,
savage-looking men.</p>

<p>&quot;What is this we have signed?&quot; they asked. &quot;We
were snatched from the road as we passed, and brought into an upper
room before two strange Filipinos. We heard they were Governor
Saguin, and Guingona, a senator. And there, beside the two, stood
Constabulary with guns. And they asked us foolish questions, like
&#39;Do you want good roads?&#39; &#39;Do you want lower
taxes?&#39; And, &#39;What are the names of the men in your
village?&#39; Then they wrote all the names down on paper. After
that they demanded our signatures, on the same paper, which had no
writing excepting columns of names. They must have got hundreds of
names on papers whose uses we do not know. Can those be petitions
pretending that we ask for Independence? Have we been tricked into
signing away our country? <i>What shall we do?&quot;</i></p>

<p>And then at last came Manila newspapers, drifting slowly south,
speaking of Independence petitions received&mdash;of anti-Wood
petitions, signed by many datus and high Moros. At that the feeling
rose to distraction.</p>

<p>I remember a night full of stars and rushing wind and the sound
of surf&mdash;and the shapes of lotus buds asleep in the
moonlight&mdash;and a dim light falling on the scarlet robe of an
old man&mdash;on his tragic face&mdash;and his weary measured
voice&mdash;and his words to me:</p>

<p>&quot;But lately I asked General Wood for his help in getting
justice for a man of mine. He helped me, kindly, as we Moros know
he always will do when he can. And now comes this lying paper. And
my heart is sick for fear lest he believe I really could be
ungrateful&mdash;that I could attack him&mdash;him&mdash;our
friend&mdash;and in the back. You are going north when you leave
us. To Manila? Yes? Then I have a favour to ask. Will you take a
paper that I shall bring you? Will you carry it with your own hand
to the Governor-General&#39;s door? For we think our sendings never
reach him if we trust them to the mails.&quot;</p>

<p>He gave me the paper in duplicate, sworn and signed. &quot;You
may keep one for the people of America,&quot; he said. &quot;No one
but you, these many years, has come to us from the people of
America, to sit down with us day after day in our own places, to
travel to see us where we live and to hear our voice. Tell the
people of America all. Beg them to help us. Beg them to remember
the past. Tell them my name, and who I am.&quot;</p>

<p>Every Moro said, &quot;Tell them my name.&quot; To do so would
mean their certain death.</p>

<p>Thus runs the old man&#39;s document:</p>

<blockquote>United States of America,<br>
Philippine Islands,<br>
Province of Zamboanga.<br>
<br>
Datu...being duly sworn, upon his oath states:<br>
<br>
That he has been informed that his alleged signature is attached to
a petition asking for Philippine Independence and containing
statements said to be derogatory to his Excellency Governor-General
Leonard Wood. That the affiant has never signed any such petition,
but that he has always, during the many years he has known
Governor-General Wood, had the greatest respect and admiration for
him, both as a man and as a public official.<br>
<br>
That he has never been a party to, nor has he ever signed a
petition or document criticizing the Governor-General in the
slightest degree. The affiant is in favour of the segregation of
Mindanao and Sulu and Palawan from the Philippine &quot;Islands and
the re-organization of same under the American Flag as an
unorganized territory of the United States, or otherwise as
Congress may deem best.</blockquote>

<p>From Cotabato, from Lanao, from Palawan, from Jolo, the Moros
poured out their written protests. To several of these I gave safe
conduct. Scores more I heard by word of mouth. Of these I cite but
one&mdash;that of a datu of ancient descent, of high standing among
his people and by them greatly respected. This man thus expressed
to me his troubled mind:</p>

<p>&quot;I have been loyal to the United States for twenty-five
years. With Datu Rajah Muda Mandi, I fought and worked to keep the
peace for America. I have learned to love America. I am an old man
now, and it is too late to change. But the protection of America
seems withdrawn from us. We see how General Wood is prevented, by
the laws made during the Scourge of Harrison, from giving us any
relief. And we know that the prevention is real because our old
friend would surely help us if any man could. And now these
Filipinos that have thrust themselves upon us&mdash;they persecute
us with strange taxes&mdash;and then they use the very money they
wring from us to force us away from America and to clutch us under
their own power.</p>

<p>&quot;And now it seems they set our names on false petitions to
send to America, saying that we ask for this evil thing. And,
taking our money, they go themselves to America and pretend to
speak for us. When I discovered this I came in fury to talk with
Alvarez&mdash;the only friend left in our country to whom we can
ease our hearts. I said:</p>

<p>&quot;&#39;I am going to make war. I am going to call out all my
people. And the women shall sew white robes for my fighting men and
we will all die.&#39; For this shame is endless, and without
sense.</p>

<p>&quot;But Alvarez said, &#39;No, Datu, Islam needs men. Wait.
America will remember one day. But it is true that America never
hears of your troubles. How can she learn? Do not think ill of
America. She is very far away.&#39;</p>

<p>&quot;Then I said, &#39;I will go among my people on an
errand.&#39;</p>

<p>&quot;Now we of Islam have seen that in Alvarez the Datu Rajah
Muda Mandi returns to us at times to counsel us in need. And at
those times we see the Datu Rajah Muda&#39;s very face.</p>

<p>&quot;Thus now perceiving, I replied:</p>

<p>&quot;&#39;So be it. I will depart and go among my people on an
errand.&#39;</p>

<p>&quot;Then I went forth to my people, and said to them, in all
their villages assembled:</p>

<p>&quot;&#39;The Filipino takes your tax money and with it sends
to America other Filipinos to speak folly in your name, saying that
you want Independence and to be governed by Filipinos. I ask you
now:&mdash;If we Moros send true Moros to America to tell the truth
for us, how much will you each give to help? For the journey is
dear. I do not ask your money now, but I want to know what may be
counted upon.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p>The response was like the response to the Liberty Loan.</p>

<p>And the secret service spies whom Governor Saguin had set upon
the old man&#39;s trail picked up the news and ran home with
it.</p>

<p>Saguin, alarmed, himself dashed out into the old chief&#39;s
territory, telling the people from village to village that
Governor-General Wood was no longer in authority, that
America&#39;s time was done, and that their duty was to &quot;tie
up&quot; their datu and send him in to jail.</p>

<p>Upon learning of this, according to my custom in such work I
went directly to consult Governor Saguin. I sat with him in his
office and told him at length the stories as I already had them,
asking for his comments and corrections.</p>

<p>Alas! His comments did not help. And he himself stood revealed
therein dancing on hot griddles to his master&#39;s
whip&mdash;ashamed&mdash;afraid to stop, afraid to go
on&mdash;above all most horribly afraid lest by some nightmare
chance he might have picked the losing side.</p>

<p>And just then, still further to the poor man&#39;s bewilderment,
came a report that the little yacht <i>Apo</i> was about to visit
Zamboanga!</p>

<p>At that, from all directions, a general movement of the Moros of
the Province set in toward Zamboanga town. Again, the Filipinos
took alarm, and in the outlying districts local officials hurried
about hotly threatening with fine and imprisonment&mdash;in one
place with twenty pesos fine and two years&#39;
imprisonment&mdash;any and all Moros who should dare go to
Zamboanga either to greet the Governor-General or to present to him
any sort of complaint or petition.</p>

<p>Had they the right to enforce such threats? The simpler Moros
did not know. But they knew the Constabulary guns.</p>

<h2>Chapter XXX &mdash; THE PLEA OF THE WOMEN</h2>

<p>Among foreign observers who have lived for a quarter of a
century with the Moro, but one testimony can be got as to Moro
morality.</p>

<p>&quot;If a man wants to draw from a Moro a black look and a
right hand quick to the knife-hilt,&quot; says one, &quot;let him
make some <i>risqu&eacute;</i> remark in the presence of Moro
women.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Reversing the Filipino,&quot; said another&mdash;and I
quote no weak witnesses&mdash;&quot;the Moro is no sniggerer. He
sees no humour at all in unclean language, stories and pictures.
They simply disgust and offend him.&quot;</p>

<p>As to the women themselves, no New England American is more
careful of her honour. The Moro girl feels that she belongs to her
father or her family until her marriage. Then she belongs to her
husband. Custom, severely enforced, forbids that any man outside
those bounds so much as touch her with a hand offered to help her
across a road. In earlier days a woman dishonoured was placed in a
fish-basket filled with stones and dropped into the sea. By the
letter of current Maguindanao law concerning adultery, both parties
to the crime are to be buried in the earth up to their necks and
then stoned to death.</p>

<p>But, so strong is Moro public opinion&mdash;so wholly does that
unity formed by Islamic law and religion govern Islam&#39;s daily
life&mdash;that offences of its moral code are exceedingly few.</p>

<p>Yet, by late figures, over 72 per cent of all crimes committed
in the Department of Mindanao and Sulu are sexual crimes. Of these,
over 50 per cent involve the acts of Filipino school-teachers or
small Filipino officials.</p>

<p>By the Manila politico much is made of the fact that the Moro
objects to sending his daughters to
school&mdash;&quot;because,&quot; says the politico, &quot;of his
bigotry.&quot; The Moro does object to sending his daughters to
school, and the true reason has just been given.</p>

<p>The one excellent school&mdash;the one piece of true
humanitarian work in all Moro-land, apart from Bishop Brent&#39;s
lesser place in Zamboanga, is the Moro Educational Foundation&#39;s
school at Jolo&mdash;a scrupulously non-proselyting effort also
founded by the Bishop and that gentle and fearless lady, Mrs.
Lorillard Spencer; largely assisted by Mrs. Thomas Emery of
Cincinnati and Mrs. Willard Straight of New York. Mrs. Spencer
spends much of her life on the spot, with the small American staff.
Her quiet influence and the affection and loyalty with which she
and her work are regarded by the Moro people, are incalculable
powers for good. A drop in the bucket, maybe&mdash;this Moro
Educational Foundation&mdash;but the sort of drop whence healing
rivers spring. I visited it, saw its work and heard its praises
with deep gratitude. It is an oasis of honour in a desert of
reproach.</p>

<p>Almost all public schools in Moro-land are taught by male
Filipinos. And the male Filipino school-teacher in the south is the
same character, with the same habits, that he is in his own
country. The difference in response lies in the different moral
quality of the populace. Put American teachers&mdash;or even
Filipino women&mdash;in place of the Filipino men, and you find the
Moro, other things being equal, ready to send his children to
school. But he will not willingly endure seeing his son made
personal servant to the Filipino school-master in lieu of being
taught. And, above all, he will not see his daughter
prostituted.</p>

<p>I cite the case before me of a Moro in jail because he refused
to send his daughter to school. The Superintendent of
Schools&mdash;an American&mdash;called on him there to
investigate.</p>

<p>&quot;I am afraid for her. Afraid of that Filipino
teacher,&quot; said the prisoner.</p>

<p>&quot;But you are wrong. The teacher is a reliable honest man
&mdash;I myself will respond for him,&quot; argued the
Superintendent, finally prevailing upon the prisoner to comply with
the law.</p>

<p>The outcome, almost at once, was exactly what the father had
feared&mdash;and the Superintendent&#39;s humiliation and helpless
rage could repay nothing of destruction wrought.</p>

<p>The following statement, which I choose from many simply because
of its commonplaceness, has been carefully checked. It is true.</p>

<p>Alvarez one day last winter found sitting at his door a poor
Moro, travel-stained, spent with hunger and weariness. The man
seemed in deep trouble, but waited patiently to be addressed. Then
he told his errand.</p>

<p>&quot;Sir,&quot; he said, &quot;I have come from...[and he named
a place that means many days&#39; foot-travel] to ask your wisdom.
I am in great distress. My case is this:</p>

<p>&quot;I have a little daughter, Idda, seven years old. She is
our only child. And now she will not go to school. I have tried all
my influence with her&mdash;for I want her to have an
education&mdash;but she will not go. She is afraid&mdash;so afraid!
I do not know why&mdash;just afraid of school. Then they fine me
for not sending her to school. I have been fined so much and so
many times because of this, that I can pay no more, for my money is
gone. My wife has even beaten the child&mdash;which hurts our
hearts. And then the officer has come and dragged her to school,
she screaming and struggling like a crazy thing, away, out of our
sight.</p>

<p>&quot;And when the officer left her with the teacher, she kicked
the teacher&mdash;fought him&mdash;bit him on his hand. My little
girl is almost frantic with fear. My wife and I, we have to watch
her all the time because she tries to get away to the river to
throw herself to the crocodiles.</p>

<p>&quot;As for me, since I have no money to pay more fines, they
will soon put me in jail and that means to leave my wife and the
child unprotected. I see only two things left to do. Either to kill
them both, for their safety, and then run amok, or else to call my
kinsmen and take to the hills as an outlaw. But first, I came here,
hoping light from your wisdom.&quot;</p>

<p>Alvarez took the matter up. It then transpired that Idda&#39;s
closest playmate had been caught in the schoolhouse, gagged, bound
and raped by the school-teacher&mdash;a Filipino. This child&#39;s
wild misery, and the things she had wailed into her comrade&#39;s
ears, had made such an impression on little Idda that the terror of
school was literally driving her mad.</p>

<p>The American Superintendent, being informed, could only say,
&quot;Let her stay at home for the present. In two months&#39; time
I shall be able to get up into that territory and see what is going
on.&quot;</p>

<p>I shall not soon forget the fixed, brooding horror stamped into
the face of an eleven-year-old girl, the victim of her Filipino
teacher, into whose case I also looked. One could scarcely have
believed that so young a child could so desperately have felt her
own tragedy. But examination led me to think that scarcely a girl
in the school here in question had escaped ruin. The man, in this
instance, got a heavy court sentence. But sentences, however heavy,
seem insufficient to reduce the number of offences. And for one
case that reaches court, who shall say how many go unheard.</p>

<p>How far, for instance, is a complaint likely to get when the
offender himself is not only the justice of the peace with whom
complaint must first be lodged, but is also the arresting and
investigating officer?</p>

<p>I am informed on the best authority, substantially re-enforced,
that when two refugee murderers were recently and erroneously said
to have escaped to the island of Basilan, the Filipino Constabulary
captain there adopted a policy of terror-ization that upset the
entire island. It is affirmed that he ordered all outlying natives
first to destroy their crops and then to move in to
<i>reconcentrado</i> camps. The Constabulary detachments enforcing
the order burned the people&#39;s houses almost over their heads,
throwing out the sick and helpless, and leaving little or no time
for the saving of goods. The labour thus secured was put to making
a road along the southern part of the island. Meantime, the
people&#39;s cattle strayed away, or were seized and sold as
ownerless, the wild hogs broke in and destroyed what remained of
the plantings, and thirty-two men were summarily shot, here and
there about the place&mdash;shot by Constabulary in satisfaction of
miscellaneous old grudges. After killing the men, it is stated, the
officers raped the women.</p>

<p>Basilan is a Moro island 482 miles square. Its population
numbers 8,000, and contains 54 voters. Its area comprises some one
hundred thousand acres of the best rubber-growing land in the
world, one-third of which is now grass land, the rest virgin
timber. About two thousand acres are now planted to rubber, and
two-thirds of the trees are being tapped. It is possible, or even
probable, however, that native instinct, rather than any
consideration of these facts, prompted the activities described in
the foregoing paragraph.</p>

<p>To move intimately among the Moro people is to become acutely
aware everywhere of tension drawn close to the breaking point.
Passing one day through a small village, I came -upon a
wedding-party. They were holding the ceremonial dance in a tent,
and the head man came forward with all eagerness to welcome an
American. At the top of the room sat the little bride and her
maids, straight and still, with hands extended flat upon their
knees, with chalk-white, delicately-painted faces, with downcast
eyes, immovable as carven goddesses.</p>

<p>&quot;Etiquette demands that they see nothing, hear nothing, and
seem apart from all earthly concern,&quot; some one explained.</p>

<p>But the rest of the party was full of life. Single dancers
succeeded each other upon the floor&mdash;sometimes a statuesque
woman, wrapped in long garments, subtly, rhythmically leading the
gongs with her flexing wrists and ankles&mdash;sometimes a youth,
dramatically dancing a story&mdash;sometimes a merry old man,
proudly proving the trim of his nerves by balancing a cup of water
upon his head while his body capered to the music. And the
audience&mdash;men, women and little children&mdash;in its wild
picturesqueness, its constant motion, its vivid interest and
applause, made a marvellous background to the picture.</p>

<p>But soon the head man reappeared&mdash;and there was urgence in
his manner&mdash;to ask that I come away for a talk. Then they led
me into one of their houses&mdash;into a room scrupulously clean,
whose furniture consisted in the main of large cushions covered
with brilliant cloths. They brought a stool and set a table before
it and laid the table with coffee and cakes for my refreshment.
Then one by one the men, all gay in their bridal best, but with
faces as stern as death, came and stood before the table and spoke.
The first said this:</p>

<p>&quot;You tell us you have come from the American people to ask
the Moros their mind. That is why we of this village are glad. Tell
the people in America that if this Independence comes all the Moros
will die in battle. The United States has been Father and Mother to
us and if you go, then that is the end of everything. We of this
village will be killed off to the last one before we will submit to
the Filipinos.</p>

<p>&quot;I used to be with General Pershing. We were happy then.
There were fights sometimes. But there was justice. And there was
liberty. Now our people are often hungry as well as angry and sad.
We can hardly earn any money now. We are taxed till our heads ache
to understand&mdash;for what is said in the morning is unsaid in
the afternoon&mdash;and the end, for us, is always punishments and
ruin and shame. And there is no work at all, except in the few
places where some American has work to give. No Filipino will give
employment to us. They shut us out wherever they can.&quot;</p>

<p>The other men amplified the statement of the first. And when
they had done, the little bride and all her women came suddenly
gliding in to seize and press my hand&mdash;again and
again&mdash;with clinging fingers that spoke for their silent
lips.</p>

<p>Those clinging fingers of women! Many a time was I to feel them,
and always with the same meaning&mdash;&quot;Tell
America!&quot;</p>

<p>Once it came in the house of a great datu, far from this wedding
village. The datu had been talking. In the end he said: &quot;I
have sent letters and petitions to the Governor-General and to
Washington until it is a weariness to think of them. I have spoken
my mind so often that I am tired and sick at heart. There is no use
in further speaking and petitioning. No fruit comes&mdash;no help.
But that General Wood is still there, and that he asks for patience
and peace, long ago I would have made an end. <i>Is Allah
dead?&quot;</i></p>

<p>His sombre voice dropped&mdash;stopped. And then came his pretty
young wife, holding her little girl-child upon her hip. And her
soft, long, clinging fingers seized and pressed and would not
release my hand, as she stood gazing up at me in silence, with
piteous tear-filled eyes.</p>

<p>Yet a third time it happened in one of the largest
towns&mdash;in the last quarter-hour of a visit that had won the
people&#39;s confidence. Now, at the end, the head man was
speaking&mdash;summing up. It was in the town square. Old cocoanut
trees &mdash;carven prows of vintas on the beach&mdash;a girl
sitting on a bullock laden with earthen pots&mdash;splendid figures
of men in bright silken draperies. The head man stood on some
elevated thing; behind him, close, his immediate retainers; below
and around, his people by hundreds. He spoke as all speak, without
a suspicion of oratory or of self-consciousness, deliberately, with
simple, certain words, born of established thought and inward
dignity. And the faces of his people caught and flashed back the
fire of his speech as a burnished sword flashes back the rays of
the sun.</p>

<p>Near him, well within ear-shot, a Filipino Constabulary officer
hovered behind the crowd. I stood it till I could stand it no
longer. Then I sent a message to interrupt the old man, pointing
out this other auditor.</p>

<p>The chief returned thanks. &quot;I knew it,&quot; he said,
&quot;but my life is already forfeit. And the one thing they cannot
take from me is my power to speak the truth. <i>Tell
America!&quot;</i></p>

<p>And there again, as I turned to go, came the tendril-like clutch
of fingers that clung and pressed hard, clinging, clinging, as if
by clinging to replace words. This time it was an old woman, the
wife of the head man, her heart in her face. Her lips were
struggling to make some word. At last it took shape, in a whisper
heavy with pleading.</p>

<p>&quot;America!&quot; and then, &quot;Poor Moros! Poor
Moros!&quot;</p>

<h2>Chapter XXXI &mdash; &quot;&mdash;OR GIVE US BACK OUR
GUNS&quot;</h2>

<p>The United States Congress, representing the responsibility of
the American people as to their Insular holdings, instructs itself
through a Senate Committee on Territories and Insular Possessions
and a House Committee on Insular Affairs.</p>

<p>Before these committees, during the session of 1923-4, appeared
Mr. Manuel Roxas, Speaker of the House of Representatives of the
Philippine Islands, to give information and to present a
request&mdash;a request for immediate Independence. Incidentally,
as in fairness must be added, it is alleged that if, toward the
end, Mr. Roxas flagged in his urgences, his gait was mended by the
spur of American beet sugar champions, privately but sharply
administered.</p>

<p>Mr. Roxas&#39;s statements, considering to whom they were
addressed, were amazingly disrespectful. For they rested on his
assumption of his hearers&#39; complete ignorance of the
facts&mdash;an ignorance that he felt himself at liberty grossly to
abuse.</p>

<p>Fully to support this statement from the text of the reports
would be burdensome to these pages. I therefore confine myself to a
specimen instance or two as relating to Moros.</p>

<hr class="short">

<p>In the hearing of February 17, 1924, Mr. Roxas said:</p>

<blockquote>...From 1913 to 1921, when we really enjoyed practical
autonomy in the Philippine Islands under the administration of
Governor Harrison during whose years we were in actual control,
running the affairs of our country, including Mindanao, and when
the officials of the government there were Filipinos, there was not
a single killing in that region for seven years.</blockquote>

<p>The official record shows during the period mentioned by Mr.
Roxas&mdash;1913-1921&mdash;one hundred and fifty-four Constabulary
engagements fought &quot;in that region.&quot; The total killings
of Moros by Constabulary recorded in these one hundred and
fifty-four engagements is four hundred and ninety-nine. As a rather
preposterously low minimum, this figure will not be questioned by
any person conversant with local affairs. What is done in far
places need seldom cumber the books. The dumb earth drinks the
blood.</p>

<p>In the House Committee&#39;s hearing of March <i>6,</i> 1924,
Mr. Roxas said:</p>

<blockquote>With reference to the assertion made by the Secretary
of War that the Moros are opposed to Independence, we beg to differ
with him. If there is any such opposition, it comes from those few
who, as a result of the organized activities of American enemies of
Independence in getting the Moros to express themselves as opposed
to Independence, salaried agents being employed for this purpose,
have been persuaded ...to express opposition.</blockquote>

<p>This accusation, ever since the Big Caciques&#39; declaration of
war upon General Wood, has frequently appeared in the Manila press.
It is the reverse of true. As to the few Americans now left in the
south, their policy has been, and is, to maintain a complete
aloofness from native political affairs. As to the one man upon
whom the caciques&#39; suspicions turned &mdash;Alvarez:&mdash;At
any moment during the past several years Al-varez could have
released a revolt that, guns or no guns, would have sent a swarm of
Filipino officialdom to its long reckoning. They have been treading
on ice far thinner than they knew&mdash;and they have actually owed
their daily lease of life to the sleepless watch of the two
men&mdash;General Wood in distant Manila, and Alvarez camping on
the spot&mdash;the two men whom they never ceased to plot against
and abuse.</p>

<p>Mr. Roxas proceeds:</p>

<blockquote>It is even reported that Hadji Gulamu<sup>1</sup>
Razul...has been offered a bribe of $3,000 if he would express
himself publicly as opposed to Independence. These are the findings
of a committee appointed by the legislature to investigate the
recent disturbances in Mindanao.</blockquote>

<p class="sup"><sup>1</sup> Moro member of the Independence
Commission to Washington.</p>

<p>Now, first of all, Hadji Gulamu&mdash;poor, vain, spoiled little
victim of somebody&#39;s ruinous kindness&mdash;would bring no
price at all except in the opposite camp, where he may appear to
have got it; and next, while cacique legislative committees pursued
Moro investigations at a safe and respectful distance, I myself
happened to be in the Moro country. Happened to be present in
several parts of that country when young Hadji Gulamu, Filipinized
Moro, drew nigh on an errand.</p>

<p>He came from Manila. His errand, if the word of any Moro or any
number of Moros be accepted as evidence, was to offer large rewards
to Moros of influence if they would declare for Independence.
Political preferment. Tax exemption for twenty years. Tax exemption
in perpetuity. Houses in Manila. Trips to Washington&mdash;to
testify. Cash down, promised in reckless figures&mdash;if promises
meant cash. And all pledged, it was repeated, in the name of Mr.
Quezon. Also, Hadji Gulamu was said to be offering to the common
people, in Jolo and in other parts, ingenious reasons why they
should add their names and thumb-marks to innocent sheets of paper
that he carried about in his pocket. Or even to write them in his
little memorandum book.</p>

<p>Of all these things I heard&mdash;and I also saw their
effect.</p>

<p>&quot;Hadji Gulamu, indeed!&quot; exclaimed one doughty old lady
of rank. &quot;Let him dare show his face in my country on his
dirty errand and my people will splash his body off the
dock.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That little beast Hadji Gulamu has sneaked into my
territory,&quot; growled a young datu, coming in haste to take
leave; &quot;a messenger brings word he is telling my people he has
my authority for his lies. I must hurry along home to throw him
out.&quot;</p>

<p>And so on, everywhere. Hadji Gulamu did not, perhaps, return
entirely empty-handed to whoever may have sent him. But his actual
gleanings can have been of but little worth.</p>

<p>Said Mr. Roxas, continuing to instruct our Congressmen:</p>

<blockquote>Associated Press dispatches from Manila have been
published in the press of this country to the effect that a
delegation of Moros had travelled from Mindanao to Manila to
express to the Governor-General their opposition to
Independence...This delegation of Moros was brought to Manila from
Mindanao by Colonel George T. Langhorne, one of the military
advisers of Governor Wood, and it is not necessary for us to say
here that pressure was probably brought to bear upon these Moros to
express themselves thus before the Governor-General. Certainly this
is not representative of the true sentiment among the
Moros.</blockquote>

<p>Again I am able to speak from personal knowledge. I saw and
talked with that delegation some hours before it reached
Governor-General Wood. I know that Colonel Langhorne had nothing
whatever to do with its coming. I know that the members of that
delegation made the journey on their own initiative, at the expense
of their individual pockets, and because their minds were as fully
obsessed with their mission as the mind of Joan of Arc was obsessed
with the cause of France.</p>

<p>I know, also, that during their brief stay in Manila they were
beset, and vainly beset, day and night, with every sort of bribe
and flattery and worriment to induce them to forswear their
people&#39;s cause.</p>

<p>Later on, in their own country, they gave me a copy of the
petition they brought. They had drafted it in council with the
other chiefs of their peoples. And Alvarez had set it into English,
from the Arabic, with scrupulous exactitude. Probably not another
man within their reach could or would have done them that service.
The signatures on the paper carry final weight as to authority, for
they represent the dictum of the several Moro peoples.</p>

<p>Many similar papers have been written before, by Moros in
council, and addressed and dispatched to the Governor-General and
to Congress. How far they got on their way, or by whom they were
sidetracked and stopped, none attempts to say. But this one at
least, if it may win a reading here, shall reach the eyes of
America. It follows: <sup>2</sup></p>

<p class="sup"><sup>2</sup> This document was accompanied by a
letter to Governor-General Wood &mdash;a copy of which I also
obtained from its writers. See Appendix II.</p>

<hr class="short">

<p>A DECLARATION OF RIGHTS AND PURPOSES ADDRESSED TO THE CONGRESS
OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</p>

<p>WHEREAS, a group of politicians, leading blindly certain
elements of the population who have a faith and culture differing
from our own, as well as widely different political aspirations,
have raised a clamour and outcry against the continuation of
American sovereignty in the Philippine Islands, thereby
jeopardizing our hope of prosperity, liberty and economic security,
through the possibility that the Congress of the United States of
America might inopportunely withdraw its sovereignty from these
Islands, permitting thereby to be created an independent government
under which the Mohammedan or Moro Nation would be destroyed or
placed under a galling yoke, we, the following representatives of
the Moro Nation, do, in the name of the same Creator, worshipped by
Christian and Mohammedan alike, set forth the following solemn
declaration of our rights, principles and intentions, for which we
pledge our lives and fortunes:</p>

<p>ASSUMING that in the course of time the United States of America
will grant complete independence, or a larger measure of autonomy
to the Philippine Islands, and due to the fact that the insecurity
of political tenure of the United States and the threat of
political domination of our people by the Christian Filipino
majority in the Islands of Luzon and the Visayas is holding back
the economic development of our country, and causing no little
unrest and unhappiness to our people, we hereby submit the
following suggestion for the solution of our present difficulties
to the consideration of the Congress of the United States of
America.</p>

<p>FIRST:&mdash;We are not seeking temporary or palliative
measures. We ask for a solution which will be permanent and lasting
in its effects. Therefore, we propose that the Islands of Mindanao
and Sulu, and the Island of Palawan be made an unorganized
territory of the United States of America.</p>

<p>In order that we may be fair to the Filipinos and in order that
they may not raise an outcry to the effect that we wish to
dismember the Philippine Islands, we propose that fifty (50) years
after independence may have been granted the rest of the Philippine
Islands, a plebiscite be held in the proposed unorganized territory
to decide by vote whether the proposed territory will be
incorporated in the government of the Islands of Luzon and Visayas,
remain a territory, or become independent.</p>

<p>This would apply the principles of justice and equity to all
elements of the population and imply a government through the
consent of the governed.</p>

<p>SECOND:&mdash;That a simple form of government be designed for
the new territory., taking into consideration that through lack of
education in English or Spanish our people cannot hope to exercise
suffrage for at least two generations, and with the following
objects in view:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) Justice and equity for Christian, Mohammedan, pagan and
foreigner alike. In order to attain this we must have Americans in
high places to act as referees between our tribal and religious
demarcations.</p>

<p>(2) No domination of one element over another.</p>

<p>(3) Freedom of speech and religion.</p>

<p>(4) Every opportunity for American capital to develop the
natural resources of our country, thereby affording our people the
opportunity to progress in the arts and sciences and in
agriculture, as well as to use the lessons of the school room after
leaving school. At present there is no outlet for the talents and
energies of our youths owing to the economic prostration of our
country.</p>

<p>(5) That the school system be reformed under American teachers
and made suitable to the needs and prejudices of the Mohammedan
population.</p>

<p>(6) That we do not vote in elections for President of the United
States, for the reason that we do not wish to do otherwise than
trust to the mercy and justice of the United States.</p>

<p>WHEREAS:&mdash;We enjoy none of the above benefits in their
fullest measure, and</p>

<p>WHEREAS:&mdash;We do not even enjoy the right of petition and
redress of wrongs which the Constitution of the United States
insures to its Citizens, owing to the fact that we have addressed
petitions without number to the Governor-General of the Philippine
Islands asking for the amelioration of our condition, and that even
when he has been disposed to grant our desires he has found himself
helpless to aid us owing to the provisions of the Organic Act known
as the Jones Law:&mdash;</p>

<p>THEREFORE, WE, in representation of nearly half a million
Mohammedan residents of Mindanao and Sulu, do solemnly affirm and
DECLARE:&mdash;</p>

<p class="sup"><sup>3</sup> THAT WE ARE LOYAL UNTO DEATH TO THE
UNITED STATES.</p>

<p>THAT IN PROOF OF THIS LOYALTY WE HAVE PLEDGED OURSELVES BY THE
MOST SOLEMN OATH KNOWN TO MOHAMMEDANS TO DIE RATHER THAN SUBMIT TO
DOMINATION BY CHRISTIAN FILIPINOS FROM THE NORTH, AND IF NECESSARY
TO DIE IN ORDER THAT THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS WHICH HERETOFORE
HAS LENT A DEAF EAR TO OUR PETITIONS MAY NOW HEAR US.</p>

<p>THAT IN THE EVENT THAT THE UNITED STATES GRANTS INDEPENDENCE TO
THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS WITHOUT PROVISION FOR OUR RETENTION UNDER
THE AMERICAN FLAG, IT IS OUR FIRM INTENTION AND RESOLVE TO DECLARE
OURSELVES AN INDEPENDENT CONSTITUTIONAL SULTANATE TO BE KNOWN TO
THE WORLD AS THE MORO NATION. IT IS THE DUTY OF THE CONGRESS OF THE
UNITED STATES TO MAKE PROVISION AT ONCE FOR THE SECURITY AND
PROTECTION PROMISED TO US WHEN WE SURRENDERED OUR ARMS TO THE
UNITED STATES ARMY. THIS PROMISE IS JUST AS SACRED AS ANY ALLEGED
PROMISES YOU MAY HAVE MADE TO THE CHRISTIAN FILIPINOS. YOU HAVE
LEFT US DEFENCELESS AND IT IS YOUR DUTY TO PROTECT US OR RETURN TO
US THE WEAPONS YOU TOOK FROM US AND WHICH WE FREELY GAVE YOU,
RELYING ON YOUR PROMISES.</p>

<p>THAT WHILE IT IS NOT OUR DESIRE TO DO SO, BY DISREGARDING OUR
RIGHTS AND WISHES WHILE AT THE SAME TIME CONCEDING POLITICAL AND
ECONOMIC FAVORS TO THE CHRISTIAN FILIPINOS, FAVORS WHICH ARE IN
TURN USED AGAINST US, YOU ARE FORCING US SURELY AND STEADILY TO
RECOURSE TO DESPERATE AND BLOODY MEASURES WHICH ARE ABHORRENT TO
US, IN VIEW OF OUR LOYALTY TO THE AMERICAN FLAG, OUR
GOVERNOR-GENERAL, AND OUR GRATITUDE TO THE UNITED STATES FOR THE
LIBERTY AND SECURITY OF LIFE WHICH WE ENJOYED UNTIL YOU DELEGATED
YOUR POWER AND AUTHORITY TO THE CHRISTIAN FILIPINOS.</p>

<p class="sup"><sup>3</sup> The capitalization is that of the
original document,</p>

<p>WE COMPLAIN THAT WE HAVE NOT ONE REPRESENTATIVE IN THE
PHILIPPINE LEGISLATURE ELECTED BY DIRECT VOTE OF THE PEOPLE. OUR
MEAGRE REPRESENTATION IS THROUGH REPRESENTATIVES APPOINTED BY THE
GOVERNOR-GENERAL WHO MUST HAVE THE APPROVAL OF A SENATE CONTROLLED
BY FILIPINOS. HENCE SUCH REPRESENTATION IS A FARCE.</p>

<p>WE COMPLAIN THAT THE PHILIPPINE LEGISLATURE APPROPRIATES ONE
MILLION PESOS PER ANNUM FOR PRO-INDEPENDENCE PROPAGANDA, THEREBY
FORCING US TO CONTRIBUTE THROUGH TAXATION WITHOUT REPRESENTATION TO
THE EFFORTS OF CERTAIN CHRISTIAN FILIPINOS TO SEVER THE BONDS
BETWEEN US AND THE UNITED STATES, ALL OF WHICH IS NOT IN ACCORDANCE
WITH OUR WISHES.</p>

<p>WE COMPLAIN THAT WHEN OUR PEOPLE, INCLUDING WOMEN AND CHILDREN,
HAVE BEEN SHOT DOWN BY THE CONSTABULARY, OR OTHERWISE MALTREATED,
INVESTIGATIONS HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED IN SUCH A MANNER AS TO GLOSS
OVER THE TRUTH.</p>

<p>WE COMPLAIN THAT IN SPITE OF THE LARGE VOLUME OF EVIDENCE OF
MISGOVERNMENT OF OUR PEOPLE PRESENTED TO THE WOOD-FORBES
COMMISSION, AND SUBSEQUENTLY TO THE GOVERNOR-GENERAL NOTHING
WHATEVER HAS BEEN DONE TO ASSURE OUR PEOPLE THAT REFORMS MEETING
WITH OUR APPROVAL WOULD BE UNDERTAKEN, FOR THE REASON THAT THE
POWER TO INSTITUTE REFORMS LIES IN YOURSELVES AND NOT IN THE
GOVERNOR-GENERAL, THE HANDS OF THE LATTER BEING TIED BY THE
PROVISIONS OF THE JONES LAW.</p>

<p>WE COMPLAIN THAT PETITIONS ARE BEING CIRCULATED WHICH OUR PEOPLE
BY MEANS OF PRESSURE FROM OFFICIAL SOURCES ARE OBLIGED TO SIGN.
THESE PETITIONS ARE FOR THE PURPOSE OF LEADING THE PEOPLE OF THE
UNITED STATES TO BELIEVE THAT WE ARE DISLOYAL TO THE UNITED STATES
AND TO OUR GOVERNOR-GENERAL, WHEN SUCH IS NOT THE CASE. EVEN
PROVINCIAL GOVERNORS AND OTHER HIGH OFFICIALS PROSTITUTE THEIR
OFFICES FOR THIS</p>

<p>PURPOSE. THEREFORE WE ARE FORCED TO TAKE CONCERTED AND VIOLENT
ACTION IN ORDER TO AVOID BEING MISREPRESENTED. EVEN AMERICANS WHO
SYMPATHIZE WITH OUR ASPIRATIONS AND LOYALTY TO THE UNITED STATES
ARE FORCED TO DISCUSS THE SITUATION IN WHISPERS, IF THEY DARE
DISCUSS IT AT ALL, FOR FEAR OF REPRISALS. SURELY THIS IS NOT IN
ACCORDANCE WITH IDEALS OF AMERICAN JUSTICE AND FAIR PLAY.</p>

<p>WE COMPLAIN THAT THE EFFORT IS BEING MADE TO SUBMERGE OUR
CIVILIZATION AND CULTURE THROUGH THE ASSIMILATION OF OUR PEOPLE BY
THE CHRISTIAN FILIPINOS. AS A MEANS TO THIS END COLONIES OF
CHRISTIAN FILIPINOS FINANCED BY THE GOVERNMENT ARE BEING INJECTED
INTO OUR MIDST, TO LATER CAUSE SUCH COMPLICATIONS AS HAVE CAUSED
UNTOLD MISERY IN THE BALKAN STATES AND EUROPEAN TURKEY,<sup>4</sup>
AND WHICH CONSTITUTE A PROBLEM TO-DAY WHICH AGAIN THREATENS THE
PEACE OF THE WORLD.</p>

<p>HAD WE THE MACHINERY OF GOVERNMENT AND TAXATION IN OUR HANDS, AS
HAVE THE CHRISTIAN FILIPINOS, WE COULD ALSO SEND MISSIONS TO
WASHINGTON TO PRESENT OUR SIDE OF THE QUESTION, BUT HAVING NEITHER,
WE CAN ONLY OFFER OUR LIVES IN ORDER THAT YOU MAY UNDERSTAND AND
ACT ACCORDINGLY.</p>

<p>THEREFORE, WE HEREBY SOLEMNLY AND RESPECTFULLY PETITION THE
CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES FOR REDRESS AND AMELIORATION OF OUR
PRESENT ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL SITUATION, AND ASK YOU, IN THE NAME
OF YOUR GOD, AND OUR GOD, WHO IS ONE AND THE SAME, THAT YOU
PROMPTLY GRANT US OUR REQUEST, IN ORDER THAT THIS, THE LAND OF OUR
FOREFATHERS, MAY NOT BE AGAIN DRENCHED IN THE BLOOD OF MOHAMMEDANS
AND CHRISTIANS WHO SHOULD BE DWELLING TOGETHER IN PEACE AND AMITY
IN THE SHELTER OF THE AMERICAN FLAG.</p>

<hr class="short">

<p class="sup"><sup>4</sup> Moros returning from pilgrimages to
Mecca or from visits to Borneo, bring in a fairly steady stream of
information as to affairs in the other East.</p>

<p>Since my return to America word has reached me of the sudden
death of Alvarez.</p>

<p>His last letter contained this passage:</p>

<blockquote>What power General Wood has&mdash;and it is not
one-tenth of what it should be&mdash;cannot be used to aid this
unhappy country without a storm of protest being raised and much
dust thrown in the eyes of America. No power but the United States
Congress can now save a people standing on the threshold of
extermination. I have done what I could and somehow I feel that my
end is near. My hope now is that you&mdash;remembering what you
have seen here&mdash;will tell America.</blockquote>

<p>So the Moros, to-day, are
leaderless&mdash;friendless&mdash;children beset by
pitfalls&mdash;hunted and betrayed, with no man to save them from
the cunning of their mortal enemy.</p>

<p>As for Alvarez&mdash;for his memory I bespeak whatever
gratitude, whatever respect, a man may earn by choosing a doomed
life and dying a martyr&#39;s death for the honour of his country
&mdash;for America.</p>

<hr class="short">

<p>It is sometimes suggested by persons profoundly unfamiliar with
the subject that the question of our presence in the Philippines be
determined by a plebiscite of the people.</p>

<p>As to the Mohammedan population of the Islands, the material
immediately foregoing is offered to indicate what the result of
such a plebiscite would be.</p>

<p>As to the &quot;wild tribes&quot; of the Luzon mountains, their
view, also, has been given here. As to the primitive pagans of
forest and fastness throughout the archipelago, the question
answers itself.</p>

<p>As to the great numerical majority in the Islands&mdash;the
Christian Filipino tao:</p>

<p>As easily and as intelligently could you take a plebiscite of
all the fowls of the air as to whether they would declare for a
gunner&#39;s perpetual open season. Were you to enquire of the taos
whether they would like a case of pneumonia, nine-tenths of them
would eagerly answer &quot;yes,&quot; and ask when and where they
might come to fetch the package. A friend of mine who has done his
best to help the taos of his neighbourhood to make and to save a
little cash, and who thereby has become their general agent and
counsel, was recently approached by his richest
prot&eacute;g&eacute; thus:</p>

<p>&quot;Sir, will you please buy me a <i>&#39;pendencia</i> next
time you go to town?&quot;</p>

<p>Now &quot;<i>&#39;pendencia&quot;</i> is the form that the
caciques&#39; watchword &quot;Independencia&quot; (independence)
takes on the tao&#39;s tongue. &laquo;</p>

<p>&quot;Buy you a &#39;pendencia, Manuel? What for?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh,&quot; answered the tao, comfortably, &quot;I hear
people talking about them. I have money now. I like to buy new
things and be in fashion.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then you want me and other Americans to leave the
Islands?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot; &#39;Sus-Maria-Jose! <i>No,</i> Sir! But what could that
have to do with it?&quot;</p>

<p>As to a plebiscite, finally, of that smallest minority, the
cacique, such a vote would produce an answer as of one man:
&quot;Give us immediate Independence. Sweep every American out of
here. Set us free to open the barrel&mdash;to get at these
cattle.&quot;</p>

<p>The Philippine Legislature, with one or two negligible
exceptions, is wholly cacique&mdash;wholly mestizo&mdash;half-caste
Chinese or half-caste Spanish. And rarely in that mental make-up
can be found the slightest conception of public office as anything
more than a chance at private gain.</p>

<p>For this the mestizo is not to blame. He is the inevitable human
product of his blood, his environment, his history, and, not least,
of his recent indigestible overdose of alien and superficial
education.</p>

<p>Should America, having so rapidly and so painfully stuffed him,
now do him a further injustice? Should she for his colic outcries
turn him loose with deadly weapons in his hand upon the helpless
millions of the people?</p>

<p>During the newspaper serialization of this volume prior to the
book publication, I have several times been asked to state my
personal opinion as to the course that America should pursue toward
the Philippine Islands. To this request I reply by re-stating the
book&#39;s purpose^ which is simply to present accurate material
for the formation of opinion, not to influence judgment. I may,
however, in closing my task, again draw attention to the fact that
the recommendations of the Wood-Forbes Commission, dated October 8,
1921, have never yet been acted upon by the United States Congress.
Neither, perhaps, has the great and illuminating mass of exhibits
submitted in support thereof been examined by Congress. The
recommendations of the Wood-Forbes Commission are as follows:</p>

<blockquote>1. We recommend that the present general status of the
Philippine Islands continue until the people have had time to
absorb and thoroughly master the powers already in their hands.<br>
<br>
2. We recommend that the responsible representative of the United
States, the Governor-General, have authority commensurate with the
responsibilities of his position. In case of failure to secure the
necessary corrective action by the Philippine Legislature, we
recommend that Congress declare null and void legislation which has
been enacted diminishing, limiting, or dividing the authority
granted the Governor-General under act of Congress No. 240 of the
Sixty-fourth Congress, known as the Jones Bill.<br>
<br>
3. We recommend that in case of a deadlock between the
Governor-General and the Philippine Senate in the confirmation of
appointments the President of the United States be authorized to
make and render the final decision.<br>
<br>
4. We recommend that under no circumstances should the American
Government permit to be established in the Philippine Islands a
situation which would leave the United States in a position of
responsibility without authority.</blockquote>

decision, pro or con, upon the validity of these recommendations,
the journey of a volunteer American to the Isles of Fear will have

JONES BILL</h2>

<p>An Act To declare the purpose of the people of the United States
as to the future political status of the people of the Philippine
Islands, and to provide a more autonomous government for those
islands.<br>
<br>
<br></p>

<p>Whereas it was never the intention of the people of the United
States in the incipiency of the War with Spain to make it a war of
conquest or for territorial aggrandizement; and</p>

<p>Whereas it is, as it has always been, the purpose of the people
of the United States to withdraw their sovereignty over the
Philippine Islands and to recognize their independence as soon as a
stable government can be established therein; and</p>

<p>Whereas for the speedy accomplishment of such purpose it is
desirable to place in the hands of the people of the Philippines as
large a control of their domestic affairs as can be given them
without, in the meantime, impairing the exercise of the rights of
sovereignty by the people of the United States, in order that, by
the use and exercise of popular franchise and governmental powers,
they may be the better prepared to fully assume the
responsibilities and enjoy all the privileges of complete
independence: Therefore <i>Be it enacted by the Senate and House of
Representatives of the United States of America in Congress
assembled,</i> That the provisions of this Act and the name
&quot;The Philippines&quot; as used in this Act shall apply to and

Legislature, herein provided for, is hereby authorized to provide
by law for the acquisition of Philippine citizenship by those
natives of the Philippine Islands who do not come within the

Islands who are citizens of the United States, or who could become

right to be heard by himself and counsel, to demand the nature and
cause of the accusation against him, to have a speedy and public

process to compel the attendance of witnesses in his behalf.</p>

without due process of law; and no person for the same offence

such suspension shall exist.</p>

<p>That no ex post facto law or bill of attainder shall be enacted
nor shall the law of primogeniture ever be in force in the
Philippines.</p>

<p>That no law granting a title of nobility shall be enacted, and
no person holding any office of profit or trust in said islands
shall, without the consent of the Congress of the United States,
accept any present, emolument, office, or title of any kind
whatever from any king, queen, prince, or foreign State.</p>

<p>That excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines
imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishment inflicted.</p>

<p>That the right to be secure against unreasonable searches and
seizures shall not be violated.</p>

Philippine Legislature shall have power to legislate with respect
to all such matters as it may deem advisable; but acts of the
Philippine Legislature with reference to land of the public domain,

law until approved by the President of the United States:
<i>Provided,</i> That upon the approval of such an act by the

the Governor-General. If he approve the same, he shall sign it; but
if not, he shall return it with his objections to that house in
which it shall have originated, which shall enter the objections at
large on its journal and proceed to reconsider it. If, after such
reconsideration, two-thirds of the members elected to that house
shall agree to pass the same, it shall be sent, together with the
objections, to the other house, by which it shall likewise be
reconsidered, and if approved by two-thirds of all the members
elected to that house it shall be sent to the Governor-General,
who, in case he shall then not approve, shall transmit the same to
the President of the United States. The vote of each house shall be
by the yeas and nays, and the names of the members voting for and
against shall be entered on the journal. If the President of the
United States approve the same, he shall sign it and it shall
become a law. If he shall not approve same, he shall return it to
the Governor-General, so stating, and it shall not become a law:
<i>Provided,</i> That if any bill or joint resolution shall not be
returned by the Governor-General as herein provided within twenty
days (Sundays excepted) after it shall have been presented to him
the same shall become a law in like manner as if he had signed it,
unless the legislature by adjournment prevent its return, in which
case it shall become a law unless vetoed by the Governor-General
within thirty days after adjournment: <i>Provided further,</i> That
the President of the United States shall approve or disapprove an
act submitted to him under the provisions of this section within
six months from and after its enactment and submission for his
approval ; and if not approved within such time, it shall become a
law the same as if it had been specifically approved. The
Governor-General shall have the power to veto any particular item
or items of an appropriation bill, but the veto shall not affect
the item or items to which he does not object. The item or items
objected to shall not take effect except in the manner heretofore
provided in this section as to bills and joint resolutions returned
to the legislature without his approval.</p>

<p>All laws enacted by the Philippine Legislature shall be reported
to the Congress of the United States, which hereby reserves the
power and authority to annul the same. If at the termination of any
fiscal year the appropriations necessary for the support of
government for the ensuing fiscal year shall not have been made,
the several sums appropriated in the last appropriation bills for
the objects and purposes therein specified, so far as the same may
be done, shall be deemed to be reappropriated for the several
objects and purposes specified in said last appropriation bill; and
until the legislature shall act in such behalf the treasurer shall,
when so directed by the Governor-General, make the payments
necessary for the purposes aforesaid.</p>

<p>SEC. 20. That at the first meeting of the Philippine Legislature
created by this Act and triennially thereafter there shall be

beginning with the fourth day of March following their election,
and who shall be entitled to an official recognition as such by all
departments upon presentation to the President of a certificate of
election by the Governor-General of said islands. Each of said
Resident Commissioners shall, in addition to the salary and the sum
in lieu of mileage now allowed by law, be allowed the same sum for
stationery and for the pay of necessary clerk hire as is now
allowed to the Members of the House of Representatives of the
United States, to be paid out of the Treasury of the United States,
and the franking privilege allowed by law to Members of Congress.
No person shall be eligible to election as Resident Commissioner
who is not a bona fide elector of said islands and who does not owe
allegiance to the United States and who is not more than thirty
years of age and who does not read and write the English language.
The present two Resident Commissioners shall hold office until the
fourth of March, nineteen hundred and seventeen. In case of vacancy
in the position of Resident Commissioner caused by resignation or
otherwise, the Governor-General may make temporary appointments
until the next meeting of the Philippine Legislature, which shall
then fill such vacancy ; but the Resident Commissioner thus elected
shall hold office only for the unexpired portion of the term
wherein the vacancy occurred.</p>

<p>SEC. 21. That the supreme executive power shall be vested in an
executive officer, whose official title shall be &quot;The
Governor-General of the Philippine Islands.&quot; He shall be

the Senate of the United States, and hold his office at the
pleasure of the President and until his successor is chosen and
qualified. The Governor-General shall reside in the Philippine
Islands during his official incumbency, and maintain his office at
the seat of government. He shall, unless otherwise herein provided,
appoint, by and with the consent of the Philippine Senate, such

commander in chief of all locally created armed forces and militia.
He is hereby vested with the exclusive power to grant pardons and
reprieves and remit fines and forfeitures, and may veto any
legislation enacted as herein provided. He shall submit within ten
days of the opening of each regular session of the Philippine
Legislature a budget of receipts and expenditures, which shall be
the basis of the annual appropriation bill. He shall commission all
officers that he may be authorized to appoint. He shall be
responsible for the faithful execution of the laws of the
Philippine Islands and of the United States operative within the
Philippine Islands, and whenever it becomes necessary he may call
upon the commanders of the military and naval forces of the United
States in the islands, or summon the posse comitatus, or call out
the militia or other locally created armed forces, to prevent or
suppress lawless violence, invasion, insurrection, or rebellion;
and he may, in case of rebellion or invasion, or imminent danger
thereof, when the public safety requires it, suspend the privileges
of the writ of habeas corpus, or place the islands, or any part

notify the President of the United States thereof, together with
the attending facts and circumstances, and the President shall have
power to modify or vacate the action of the Governor-General. He

such official report of the transactions of the government of the
Philippine Islands to an executive department of the United States
to be designated by the President, and his said annual report shall
be transmitted to the Congress of the United States ; and he shall
perform such additional duties and functions as may in pursuance of
law be delegated or assigned to him by the President.</p>

<p>SEC. <i>22.</i> That, except as provided otherwise in this Act,

vacate their offices as members of said commission:
<i>Provided,</i> That the heads of executive departments shall
continue to exercise their executive functions until the heads of
departments provided by the Philippine Legislature pursuant to the
provisions of this Act are appointed and qualified. The Philippine
Legislature may thereafter by appropriate legislation increase the
number or abolish any of the executive departments, or make such
changes in the names and duties thereof as it may see fit, and
shall provide for the appointment and removal of the heads of the
executive departments by the Governor-General: <i>Provided,</i>

respect to all government branches.</p>

<p>He shall keep the general accounts of the government and
preserve the vouchers pertaining thereto.</p>

<p>It shall be the duty of the auditor to bring to the attention of
the proper administrative officer expenditures of funds or property
which, in his opinion, are irregular, unnecessary, excessive, or
extravagant.</p>

<p>There shall be a deputy auditor appointed in the same manner as
the auditor. The deputy auditor shall sign such official papers as
the auditor may designate and perform such other duties as the
auditor may prescribe, and in case of the death, resignation,
sickness, or other absence of the auditor from his office, from any
cause, the deputy auditor shall have charge of such office. In case
of the absence from duty, from any cause, of both the auditor and
the deputy auditor, the Governor-General may designate an
assistant, who shall have charge of the office.</p>

<p>The administrative jurisdiction of the auditor over accounts,
whether of funds or property, and all vouchers and records
pertaining thereto, shall be exclusive. With the approval of the
Governor-General he shall from time to time make and promulgate
general or special rules and regulations not inconsistent with law
covering the method of accounting for public funds and property,
and funds and property held in trust by the government or any of
its branches: <i>Provided,</i> That any officer accountable for
public funds or property may require such additional reports or
returns from his subordinates or others as he may deem necessary
for his own information and protection.</p>

<p>The decisions of the auditor shall be final and conclusive upon
the executive branches of the government, except that appeal
therefrom may be taken by the party aggrieved or the head of the
department concerned within one year, in the manner hereinafter
prescribed. The auditor shall, except as hereinafter provided, have
like authority as that conferred by law upon the several auditors
of the United States and the Comptroller of the United States
Treasury and is authorized to communicate directly with any person
having claims before him for settlement, or with any department,
officer, or person having official relations with his office.</p>

<p>As soon after the close of each fiscal year as the accounts of
said year may be examined and adjusted the auditor shall submit to
the Governor-General and the Secretary of War an annual report of
the fiscal concerns of the government, showing the receipts and
disbursements of the various departments and bureaus of the
government and of the various Provinces and municipalities, and
make such other reports as may be required of him by the
Governor-General or the Secretary of War.</p>

<p>In the execution of their duties the auditor and the deputy
auditor are authorized to summon witnesses, administer oaths, and
to take evidence, and, in the pursuance of these provisions, may
issue sub-p&oelig;nas and enforce the attendance of witnesses, as
now provided by law.</p>

<p>The office of the auditor shall be under the general supervision
of the Governor-General and shall consist of the auditor and deputy
auditor and such necessary assistants as may be prescribed by
law.</p>

<p>SEC. 25. That any person aggrieved by the action or decision of
the auditor in the settlement of his account or claim may, within
one year, take an appeal in writing to the Governor-General, which
appeal shall specifically set forth the particular action of the
auditor to which exception is taken, with the reason and
authorities relied on for reversing such decision.</p>

<p>If the Governor-General shall confirm the action of the auditor,
he shall so indorse the appeal and transmit it to the auditor, and
the action shall thereupon be final and conclusive. Should the
Governor-General fail to sustain the action of the auditor, he
shall forthwith transmit his grounds of disapproval to the
Secretary of War, together with the appeal and the papers necessary
to a proper understanding of the matter. The decision of the
Secretary of War in such case shall be final and conclusive.</p>

<p>SEC. 26. That the supreme court and the courts of first instance
of the Philippine Islands shall possess and exercise jurisdiction
as heretofore provided and such additional jurisdiction as shall
hereafter be prescribed by law. The municipal courts of said
islands shall possess and exercise jurisdiction as now provided by
law, subject in all matters to such alteration and amendment as may
be hereafter enacted by law; and the chief justice and associate
justices of the supreme court shall hereafter be appointed by the
President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate of the
United States. The judges of the court of first instance shall be
appointed by the Governor-General, by and with the advice and
consent of the Philippine Senate: <i>Provided,</i> That the
admiralty jurisdiction of the supreme court and courts of first
instance shall not be changed except by Act of Congress. That in
all cases pending under the operation of existing laws, both
criminal and civil, the jurisdiction shall continue until final
judgment and determination.</p>

<p>SEC. 27. That the Supreme Court of the United States shall have
jurisdiction to review, revise, reverse, modify, or affirm the
final judgments and decrees of the Supreme Court of the Philippine
Islands in all actions, cases, causes, and proceedings now pending
therein or hereafter determined thereby in which the Constitution
or any statute, treaty, title, right, or privilege of the United
States is involved, or in causes in which the value in controversy
exceeds $25,000, or in which the title or possession of real estate
exceeding in value the sum of $25,000, to be ascertained by the
oath of either party or of other competent witnesses, is involved
or brought in question ; and such final judgments or decrees may
and can be reviewed, revised, reversed, modified, or affirmed by
said Supreme Court of the United States on appeal or writ of error
by the party aggrieved within the same time, in the same manner,
under the same regulations, and by the same procedure, as far
applicable, as the final judgments and decrees of the district
courts of the United States.</p>

<p>SEC. 28. That the government of the Philippine Islands may grant
franchises and rights, including the authority to exercise the
right of eminent domain, for the construction and operation of
works of public utility and service, and may authorize said works
to be constructed and maintained over and across the public
property of the United States, including streets, highways,
squares, and reservations, and over similar property of the
government of said islands, and may adopt rules and regulations
under which the provincial and municipal governments of the islands
may grant the right to use and occupy such public property
belonging to said Provinces or municipalities: <i>Provided,</i>
That no private property shall be damaged or taken for any purpose
under this section without just compensation, and that such
authority to take and occupy land shall not authorize the taking,
use, or occupation of any land except such as is required for the
actual necessary purposes for which the franchise is granted, and
that no franchise or right shall be granted to any individual,
firm, or corporation except under the conditions that it shall be
subject to amendment, alteration, or repeal by the Congress of the
United States, and that lands or right of use and occupation of
lands thus granted shall revert to the governments by which they
were respectively granted upon the termination of the franchises
and rights under which they were granted or upon their revocation
or repeal. That all franchises or rights granted under this Act
shall forbid the issue of stock or bonds except in exchange for
actual cash or for property at a fair valuation equal to the par
value of the stock or bonds so issued; shall forbid the declaring
of stock or bond dividends, and, in the case of public-service
corporations, shall provide for the effective regulation of the
charges thereof, for the official inspection and regulation of the
books and accounts of such corporations, and for the payment of a
reasonable percentage of gross earnings into the treasury of the
Philippine Islands or of the Province or municipality within which
such franchises are granted and exercised: <i>Provided further,</i>
That it shall be unlawful for any corporation organized under this
Act, or for any person, company, or corporation receiving any
grant, franchise, or concession from the government of said
islands, to use, employ, or contract for the labour of persons held
in involuntary servitude; and any person, company, or corporation
so violating the provisions of this Act shall forfeit all charters,
grants, or franchises for doing business in said islands, in an
action or proceeding brought for that purpose in any court of
competent jurisdiction by any officer of the Philippine government,
or on the complaint of any citizen of the Philippines, under such
regulations and rules as the Philippine Legislature shall
prescribe, and in addition shall be deemed guilty of an offence,
and shall be punished by a fine of not more than $10,000.</p>

<p>SEC. 29. That, except as in this Act otherwise provided, the
salaries of all the officials of the Philippines not appointed by
the President, including deputies, assistants, and other
employ&eacute;s, shall be such and be so paid out of the revenues
of the Philippines as shall from time to time be determined by the
Philippine Legislature; and if the legislature shall fail to make
an appropriation for such salaries, the salaries so fixed shall be
paid without the necessity of further appropriations therefor. The
salaries of all officers and all expenses of the offices of the
various officials of the Philippines appointed as herein provided
by the President shall also be paid out of the revenues of the
Philippines. The annual salaries of the following-named officials
appointed by the President and so to be paid shall be: The

compensation of their deputies, assistants, and other help, as well
as all other expenses incurred by the Provinces and municipalities,
shall be paid out of the provincial and municipal revenues in such
manner as the Philippine Legislature shall provide.</p>

<p>SEC. 31. That all laws or parts of laws applicable to the

<h3>Appendix II</h3>

<p>Covering letter handed to Governor-General Wood by the
Delegation of Moro Leaders who conveyed from Zamboanga to the
Governor-General, in Manila, the Declaration of Rights and
Purposes. See pp. 334-8 ante</p>

<p>Zamboanga, P. I., February i, 1924.</p>

<p>HIS EXCELLENCY,<br>
GOVERNOR-GENERAL LEONARD WOOD,<br>
MANILA, P. I.<br>
<br>
SIR:&mdash;</p>

<p>Herewith a &quot;Declaration of Rights and Purposes&quot;
addressed to the Congress of the United States of America. If your
Excellency deems it fit and proper that an expression of the views
of the Mohammedan population be made at this time, we respectfully
ask that the same be forwarded with such recommendations and
comment as may seem pertinent and proper. It is not the purpose or
desire of the Mohammedans of this region to embarrass in any way
your Excellency&#39;s administration at this time, but the recent
action of the Philippine Legislature in attempting to force on us
officials and measures which are repugnant to us makes it
imperative that we make the attempt at once to forcefully put
before Congress the necessity for remedial measures if bloodshed
and disorder are to be avoided in Mindanao-Sulu.</p>

<p>We are grateful to your Excellency for the proposals you have
advanced for the amelioration of our condition. However, they are
only palliative, and if we are to effect a cure for our woes, we
must apply the only remedy possible, and that is the separation of
Mindanao-Sulu and Palawan, and a guarantee of American sovereignty.
We realize that only Congress has the power to cure our ills.</p>

<p>We have, during past Administrations, addressed many petitions
to the Governor-General and to Congress. These have either been
intercepted or have fallen on deaf ears. Hence it is necessary that
we take steps which will ensure our being heard at Washington. On
the other hand, the Filipinos with the Legislative machinery at
their disposal, and with a fund of a million pesos at their
disposition, make themselves heard, and through control of the
Government, endeavour by force or otherwise to stifle our national
consciousness. No one can deny that the United States Congress when
it passed the Jones Bill, completely disenfranchised us and put us
under the domination of our traditional enemies, who are not even
natives of Mindanao-Sulu. This was due to the fact that when the
Jones Bill was presented to Congress there was no representative of
the Moros to say a word for us, and the Filipinos were not generous
enough to provide for us. In fact it was not in accordance with
their desires to give us any chance for self-expression.</p>

<p>In the presence of hundreds, and perhaps thousands, of our
people Secretary of War Dickenson promised us that we need never
fear the withdrawal of American sovereignty from Mindanao-Sulu.
This was in the presence of General Pershing. Governor-General
Burton Harrison made us the same promise. However, each year has
seen our liberties curtailed a little more, and more measures
repugnant to us forced upon us. Now our people ask daily, &quot;Are
promises only valid when made to the Christian Filipinos, or has
Congress forgotten our existence?&quot;</p>

<p>We respectfully suggest that if Congress takes favourable action
a Commission be appointed headed by your Excellency, and composed
of three Christian Filipino members, three Mohammedan members, all
of the above natives of Mindanao-Sulu and of Palawan, and three
Americans who have been residents of Mindanao-Sulu and of Palawan
for at least five years, to draw up a Constitution for the proposed
unorganized territory.</p>

<p>The Mohammedan population is almost unanimously actuated in this
connection by the highest sentiments of loyalty to the United
States, and of personal loyalty to your Excellency.</p>

<p>Respectfully,<br>
THE COMMITTEE OF PETITIONS AND COMMUNICATIONS.</p>
