<h2><a id="ch0"></a>PREFACE</h2>

<p class="first">
I HAVE been intimate with some who risked and with some who lost
life for causes to which they were devoted, and came to
understand that with many the political images in imagination
were but the psychic body of spiritual ideas.  Behind the open
argument lurked a spiritual mood which was the true decider of
destiny.  Nations conceive of themselves as guided or sustained
by a divine wisdom, and I have wondered in what manner impulse
might flow from Heaven to Earth.  Out of my meditation on this
came <em>The Interpreters</em>. Those who take part in the
symposium suppose of the universe that it is a spiritual being,
and they inquire what relation the politics of Time may have to
the politics of Eternity.  Their varying faiths have been held by
many ancients and by some who are modern, but the symposium has
been laid in a future century so that ideals over which there is
conflict today might be discussed divested of passion and apart
from transient circumstance.  I was not interested in the
creation of characters but in tracking political moods back to
spiritual origins, and <em>The Interpreters</em> may be taken as
a symposium between scattered portions of one nature dramatically
sundered as the soul is in dream. &mdash;A.E.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch1"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

<p class="first">
ON an evening in the late autumn a young man was hurrying
through the lit crowded streets of his city, his mind but dimly
aware of his fellow-citizens, for he was raised above himself by
the adventure on which he was bent, and what had been familiar
seemed now remote as the body is to the soul in spiritual
exaltation. Because the high purpose seeks the companionship of
high things, he paused awhile, looking beyond the dark roofs,
where, over horizons of murky citron, the air glowed through
regions of passionate green to a blue abyss becoming momentarily
more fathomless.  Never to his eyes had that vision appeared so
beautiful, trembling from one exquisite transience of color to
another.  Tall pillars crested with a ruby glow marked the
airways, and their dark lines and lights sank westward over the
city.  On each side the freighted galleons, winged shapes of dusk
and glitter, roared overhead, whirring up swiftly from the
horizon or fading with all their glitter into the green west. Not
these hurrying lights his eye sought, but those changeless lights
which have watched earth from its beginnings.  Some cosmic
emotion made him feel akin with those heavenly lights.  A world
empire was in trouble.  A nation long restless under its rule had
resurrected ancient hopes, and this young man with many others
was bent on a violent assertion of its right to freedom.  His
imagination had long passed beyond fear of death.  But, having in
thought cast life aside, life strangely had become richly
augmented.  He seemed to himself a being of fire dwelling in a
body of air, so intense was feeling, so light his limbs.  In that
mood the people in the streets, on his own level yesterday,
appeared faint as shadows; but as compensation a new
multitudinous life sprang up within him as if all those who had
his hope and were with him in his deed had come to a mystic unity
in the spirit.  In this dilation of consciousness he felt the
gods were with him, and it was then he looked up at the stars,
feeling in an instant of vision that he was comrade with them and
with all god-inspired life, and they, with earth and its people,
were sustained and directed by one inflexible cosmic will.  He
felt it strange he had not realized before how high was the
enterprise to which he had been led by a study of the history and
culture of his nation.  He moved confidently as a warrior of
antiquity with whom Athene or Hera went invisibly to battle.  He
was a poet, and because his soul was a treasure-house stored with
the thoughts of the great who lived before him, he interpreted
his own emotions as his more uneducated comrades never could have
done, they whose action was instinctive, and whose minds were not
subtle enough to discern the immortal mingling with their moods,
and who would perhaps have lost enthusiasm if they had been told
what purposes Nature had with them, and to what event, aeons
away, they were being led, and that this heroic enterprise of
their life was but an hour's incident in a cyclic pilgrimage.</p>

<p>As he crossed an open square there came a roar which shook the
air. An orange flame spurted athwart the dusky citron of the sky,
and after that clouds of smoke ruddily obscure, began to pile
themselves up gigantically in the higher blue of night.  He gazed
at this uprising of flame as the Israelites of old might have
looked on the cloud and the fire which mantled the Shepherd of
their host, for this was the signal that at the other end of the
city the revolt had begun.  Yet his body shivered, for the
intelligence in it which stood sentinel guarding its mortality
knew that this conflagration began a struggle in which itself
might  perish, and which for it would be the end of all.  That
mute appeal was unheeded, for the will of the young man was like
a drawn bow, and life the arrow ready to be sped by the will.  He
experienced the terrible joy of life which has been emancipated.
The spirit of man had risen from the grave which was fear, was
emerging from that narrow prison cell like the sky-reaching genie
from the little copper vessel in the tale of Arabian enchantment.
Like a god it was laying hands on the powers of storm and
commotion.  Life had broken its moulds. It was no longer static
but fluid, a river moving to some ocean. He watched the ruddily
glowing smoke hungrily.  Underneath it he imagined faces pale and
bright.  There were comrades, fearless, willful, laughing,
intoxicated as he was himself, breaking the iron law of the Iron
Age.  After centuries of frustrated effort the nation, long
dominated by an alien power which seemed immutable, had a
resurrection.  It would join the great procession of states, of
beings mightier than man created by man.  It would become like
Egypt, Assyria, Greece, or Rome.  The genius of multitudes would
unite to give it spiritual greatness.  Thoughts like these
thronged the brain of the young man as he moved closer to the
great building which he and others had planned to take by
surprise.  The moment arranged drew nigh.  Hundreds of men were
mysteriously gathering, loitering with intent, gazing at the
distant illumination in the sky yet all the time nearing the gate
of the arsenal.  What had brought about that orchestration of
life?  They were united in the deed.  Were they really united in
soul?  Was the same mood in the heart of that sombre concentrated
workman as in the imaginative poet or that sharp-featured cynical
journalist?  Were they all raised above themselves by the same
aspiration?  Here were men hardly able to restrain themselves
from action, which was their life.  Here were thinkers drawn by
some agony of conscience which bade them leave the fireside and
the intimate lives about it, trusting their young to a destiny
which, had they thought over it, had ever seemed heedless of
life.  Had each one his own dream which he believed his nation
would fulfill?  Or was there a Wisdom moving all for purposes of
its own?  Was there an inexorable war waged by the gods upon
humanity, shattering its peace, never allowing it to rest,
shepherding the host from cycle to cycle until it had grown to
power and those divine enemies became its kinsmen?  Of what lay
beneath that gathering the poet, for all his imagination, knew
little, for he was so blinded by his own impulse, that he imputed
it to those who moved with him, that crowd which grew ever
thicker, casting furtive glances at each other, at those they did
not recognize, who might be agents of the power they sought to
overthrow.  Every heart heard its own beating.  Here were
resolute men who would act.  Then the hour struck from a tall
spire, bell after bell tolling slowly as if it symbolized the
beating of the heart of the nation.  On the instant men
everywhere put on their sleeves the scarf which revealed all to
each other.  Those hitherto only known to the leaders of their
groups could now recognize their comrades.  Weapons of all kinds
were drawn forth.  Voices rang out sternly in command, and the
crowd, a river of fiery life, surged through the open gate of the
arsenal.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch2"></a>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p class="first">
WE waken from dream, from a nightmare in which we fought with
demons, to find the body cold, clammy, and trembling, but all
recollection of that dark agony is soon lost beyond recall.  The
body still shudders but knows not why.  Our ascents to Heaven,
our descents into Hell, lay too high or too heavy a burden upon
the soul for memory.  It cannot mirror them for more than an
instant, and they melt dreamlike from consciousness.  Of the
physical conflict in the arsenal the poet remembered little.  It
was blurred to his intellect by excess of energy or passion as
objects are blurred to the eye by excess of light.  He came back
to himself at last crowded into a corner with a group of his
surviving comrades cut off from escape.  Here at least the
revolution had failed. Empires are like those beings in the
Apocalypse full of eyes within and without.</p>

<p>One of these eyes had discovered a detail of the conspiracy
and the open gate of the arsenal was a trap.  Another of these
apocalyptic eyes overlooked them searching for persons of power
among the rebels.  They were taken one by one as a finger pointed
them out.  The poet was of these.  He was led by his guards up
many steps and along many dim-lit corridors and was halted at
last by a door about which armed men stood sentinel.  He was
thrust within and the door was locked behind him.  He was greeted
by a tumult of gay and exalted voices.  It was a spiritual
gaiety.  The voices had the exaltation of those who had been
engaged in a death-struggle not so much with others as with
themselves and had been conquerors.  They could not have
explained why they were so gay. They were prisoners and defeated.
Some of them were wounded.  On the morrow they might be standing
with their backs to a wall taking a wild farewell of the sky,
drinking greedily the last drop in the cup of life before a voice
called on the executioners to fire. The exaltation was secret and
of the spirit, for all conflicts are at the last between soul and
body and here the soul had triumphed; the immortal in each one
had made a great stride to conscious dwelling within them and it
was sustaining them with its own lavish power.  Outwardly they
were but men who had not failed each other however they had
failed in their enterprise.  Their gaze on each other was frank
and affectionate.  The young poet was hailed uproariously by
those who knew him.  Others who had heard of him gazed on him
with pride.</p>

<p>"All here for Valhalla!"'</p>

<p>"I also am a traveler," said the newcomer.</p>

<p>"They will never allow you to go, Lavelle.  You might be
admitted. There will be no lingering over our fate.  Hell was
built for such rascals as we are."</p>

<p>"Hush, fools, we may be out before day-break.  Does that sound
like a city subdued?"</p>

<p>The room was reddening in a glow from without.  There was a
rattle increasing in intensity, not in one place but over the
city.  Then came a sinister noise like a sabre of sound swishing
through the air and deeper and more tremendous notes boomed from
further distances.</p>

<p>"See! see!" cried one.  "The air lights have gone out."</p>

<p>They crowded to the windows.  The towering poles which had
lifted up their red lamps through the dusk to guide the night
journeying airships were now lightless and darkly silhouetted
against glowing masses of smoke.  The airships were scattering,
flying wildly, like winged dragons on some fabulous adventure who
had met a volcano in eruption on their path.  Some had ascended,
their lights scintillating remotely in the higher darkness, while
others in lower levels flashed flame-colored against the blue,
their wings gilded with fire from the glowing city below.</p>

<p>"They must come down!  They will be ours!  There were men
ready to rush the boats.  They cannot risk passage east or west
with the ways unlighted!"</p>

<p>Rumor started mysteriously among the prisoners.  Some one had
heard or surmised something, and in the fever of feeling it grew
in a moment, like a phantasmal tree created by the magic of a
fakir, to be of gigantic import.  This rumor dwindled to give
place to others more exciting.  The poet soon turned away, gazing
through a window at the spectacle of the night which never tired
him. Imagination was at work.  It created huge figures of gods
seated on the mountains that lay around the city, figures still
as if cast in gold, with immense pondering brows bent downward,
waiting, perhaps, for god folk to rise up from men folk out of
that furnace into which so many had cast themselves as a
sacrifice.</p>

<p>"You should feel proud as Helen looking over the ruins of
Troy."</p>

<p>An intense guttural voice was in his ear.  Lavelle turned
round and saw a pallid face with beaked nose, lips thick but not
sensual, humorous rather, even mocking, quick moving black eyes
like polished ebony, bushy gray brows and hair, every feature
carved and etched by mind, the head large on a shrunken body.  It
was the writer he had seen in the crowd, Leroy, a notoriety, in
whose work fantastical humor hardly disguised the agony of the
idealist without faith in society.  There existed between himself
and the poet that attraction which opposites have for each other.
His feeling for Lavelle was friendly, almost tender.  He looked
sorrowfully upon the face of the young poet so unlike his own,
upon a noble beauty whose invisible sculptors were ecstasy,
ardour, and the music of murmured or chanted speech.</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Why, who created the spirit of this revolt?  Who led the
people to quit the beer which gives peace, to drink the heady
wine of imagination?  Who ransacked the past and revived the
traditions of the nation?  Who but you found in the fairy tales
of its infancy the basis of a future civilization?  The wine has
gone to peoples' heads.  What are they doing?  Thinking they are
building a heaven on earth while they are fighting like
devils!"</p>

<p>"Ah!" said the poet.  "I wish it were true.  But you know how
little high traditions move the people."</p>

<p>"It may be so with them but not with the leaders.  The people
may not guess the thoughts that move the mightier of their kind
but they follow all the same.  And the leaders are aglow from a
phosphorescence engendered in the brains of poets like you, or
imaginative historians like Brehon.  What is it they are led by
in the end but a fragile thought;  a colored dream;  a thing of
air!"</p>

<p>"No! no!" said Lavelle impetuously.  "It is not unreal.
Heaven is in the kindled spirit of man.  How do you come to be
here yourself? Are you not with us?  For what but a dream do you
cast away life?"</p>

<p>"Oh," said the other, "I am an anarchist and I wish to be
free, and also my Dark Angel told me there was nothing real in my
character and I wished to test it."</p>

<p>"What did you find in yourself?"</p>

<p>"Nothing!  More foam on wilder waters!  But who is this?"</p>

<p>The door had opened again, and a man, by attire, manner, and
voice evidently a personage, was pushed in backwards protesting
vehemently of his innocence, that he was not a rebel, that he
hated them, when an ungentle thrust from the weapon of his guard
cut short speech from him, and he was propelled from the doorway
into the room.</p>

<p>"You can explain all that tomorrow," said a surly voice,
evidently skeptical that the prisoner could explain the
circumstance which caused his arrest.  The door was again closed.
The newcomer turned to face the curious and not too friendly
faces of the prisoners.</p>

<p>"You are the fanatics who have upset the city!  I hope there
will not be one of you alive tomorrow night!"</p>

<p>"Sir," said Leroy, "I do not know how you came to be here, but
I am sure it is not your good angel who inspires you to speak as
you do.  There are some here who might insist on your escape
through the window, and the distance from the window to the
pavement is exactly the distance from life to death."</p>

<p>"I think I know who this is," said another prisoner.  Then
turning to the last arrival he asked "Why did they take you?  You
are not of us."</p>

<p>Then newcomer was quieting, his agitation overcome by coolness
of those about him.  He had picked up a colored scarf in the
street, missing the owner who was hurrying on, and he was still
holding it when he was arrested by a patrol.  The scarf was worn
by those active in the revolt.  One of the prisoners whispered to
Leroy it was more likely the arrest was made because of the
prisoner's personal likeness to one of their own leaders.  The
newcomer mentioned his name, Heyt, the autocrat of one of those
great economic federations which dominated state policy and whose
operations had created deep bitterness among the revolting
people. The name was greeted with roars of laughter.  The patrol
had arrested a pillar of state.   "The guilty on both sides in
the same prison!" cried Leroy.  "I never believed Deity had any
attributes but I must now endow it with the attribute of humor.
Sir," he said, turning to Heyt, "If you should be shot before me
tomorrow you may die with the consolation that your death has
shaken a skeptic in his unbelief."</p>

<p>Heyt, whose features had assumed the expression of haughtiness
which seemed habitual to them, looked disdainfully at Leroy and
made no reply.  He sat down on a bench which ran along by the
wall, ignoring his fellow-prisoners who also ignored him as an
unlikely source of information about the progress of the revolt.
The excitement began to dwindle, a more solemn mood to replace
the gaiety and to turn their thoughts to that other world, in
which, had they known it, they already existed, entering it in
all hours of intense and deeper being.  Even to the heaven lit
spirit of the saint the prospect of death and the transit from
familiar things induces solemnity of feeling, though the heart
has the certitude that there is the heart's desire.   These for
the most part had taken little thought of that morrow or what
spiritual raiment might be put on them, but they remembered the
popular persistent talk about death and judgment, and they began
to speculate among themselves upon such things as men who knew
their stay here may be short and who must think of their further
traveling.  Leroy with his back to them listened irritably to
their anticipations of death and after.  Looking out through a
window he began whistling softly and savagely to himself.  That
men who were in revolt against the conventions of this world
should accept the conventions of the next world, which to him
were even more objectionable, angered him so that he could hardly
trust himself to speech.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch3"></a>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<p class="first">
IT is rarely that a single mood stays long with those who
believe they are nigh to death.  A horde of thoughts and feelings
rush from the subconscious as if they knew how little time
remained for them to prove themselves.  There is swift reaction.
Leroy's desperate mood soon passed, his ironic humor kindled by
the desire of a prisoner for consolation by a priest of his
church.</p>

<p>"Do you really believe his blessing will secure you welcome in
the Kingdom of Heaven?" he said.  "My Dark Angel tells me there
has been very little difference between his ideas of religion and
the churches' for a very long time, so little, indeed, that his
master was thinking of quietly dropping his old title and calling
himself God.  Myself I hold the substitution was effected
centuries ago and was quite unnoticed.  Everything went on as
before.  The princes of religion sat undisturbed upon episcopal
thrones.  I think," he added grimly, their long and faithful
services to their new master merit sympathetic consideration from
the judge of all the world."</p>

<p>The prisoners gathered, laughing around Leroy.  His resolute
spirit dominated the rest as resolute spirits do all men in time
of peril. They began to even their mood to his.</p>

<p>"Come, tell us all about it!  What is to be our fate?  Will
there be another court-martial in Heaven when we are dispatched
here?"</p>

<p>"What are we guilty of before Heaven?  What relation have the
politics of time to the politics of eternity?  Are we concerned
with the battles of beasts in the jungle, or the pursuit and
flight under the waters?  If there are beings above us, not of
our order, how do we offend them?  Do we throw Heaven into
disorder when we revolt against tyranny here?  I do not think the
ridgepole of the universe is so fragile as to be shaken by our
rubbing ourselves against it."</p>

<p>"I think," said Lavelle, "that Heaven and Earth must be a
Unity, and that men are often Heaven inspired, and that ideas
descend on us from a divine world, and they must finally make a
conquest of Earth and draw us into a conscious unity with the
Heavens.  If the universe is a spiritual being, everything
finally must be in harmony with it, and wild creatures, the
elements even, undergo a transfiguration, fierce things becoming
gentle, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The shark becoming vegetarian," interrupted Leroy.  "O
Lavelle, Lavelle, you are the imperialist of idealism.  When you
had remade the nation in your own image you would impose the law
of your being upon the world.  Even the fishes would be swept
into your net.  How wise was the Chinese sage who said 'when a
man begins to reform the world I perceive there will be no end to
it.'  There, would be no place in your universe for an
individualist like myself.  I would be a gnat irritating its
spiritual body."</p>

<p>"You may laugh at the marriage of Heaven and Earth," Lavelle
spoke again.  "But there is a power behind ideas.  I remember
what a dispirited group met to discuss the revolt, what a burden
lay upon every heart.  Yet when we decided to act for the nation
what a magical transformation took place!  How joyful every one
became! They were gay and laughed and cried as if it was
resurrection morn. What was the source of that joy?  By what
alchemy was the chill made fiery?  I felt glowing as if Heaven
had lifted me up to itself. What was that but the power of an
idea?  You felt it yourself.  Is there one even here who would
wish now to withdraw?  Would we not all prefer death with our
nation fighting against the rule of the iron powers?"</p>

<p>"No, no, not one of us repents," cried the prisoners.</p>

<p>"I prefer to be here, it is true," said Leroy.  "But I cannot
convince myself that I am not a fool.  It is ludicrous to me to
feel heroic irrational emotions welling up in me overturning
reason. It is doubtless heredity.  Some remote ancestor of mine
ought to be executed in my place."</p>

<p>"No, no, Leroy.  The heroic is the deep reality in you and all
of us.  It is translucent to spirit and the will of Heaven is
seen in its actions."</p>

<p>"Are our actions then all Heaven inspired?  If I am anything I
am an anarchist.  I would break up tyrannies because I am a lover
of liberty.  I wish to be free to come and go, to do or not to
do, to think as I will, to speak as I will.  You would have your
nation free that it might come under another domination;  that
there might be but one cultural mood in it.  You want an
orchestration of life so that every one in the nation may have
the same character and their works make one harmony.  There is
Rian, who is an artist.  I think he is with us truly because the
state does not create beauty. I found him in a rage cursing the
last imperial edifice in our city. It was designed by a
blockhead, he said, to house blockheads whose work it would be to
make the whole nation into blockheads.  Men ought to revolt
against a state which imposes a dull ugliness upon us all our
lives.  Was not that so, Rian?"  Leroy said to a young man who
was listening to the talk.</p>

<p>"Well, it helped to bring me here anyhow," said Rian,
smiling.</p>

<p>"Rian is fighting for beauty.  Between himself and Heaven that
is his motive.  He is a creature of aesthetic passions.  Put
power into his hands and he would arrest people for wearing
inharmonious colors in the streets.  Our great Culain is a
socialist.  He has an economic ideal while you have a cultural
ideal.  I think every one who is with us turned different faces
to Heaven in their prayers. Does Heaven accept them all?  Are all
these conflicting ideals in the cosmic plan?  If it approves
everything it designs nothing.  I am sure too that there are
those fighting against us who believe their empire is a
manifestation of the Absolute, and they are filled with as pure a
glow as you are."</p>

<p>"Do you really believe, Leroy, that the same quality of
inspiration can exist in opposites?"</p>

<p>"Well, the opposites at least are willing to pay for their
inspiration in the same coin of life as you are.  Is it not
better to base your case simply on obvious right than to bring in
a mystical theory of nationality?  Every people today fights in
the name of God. The ancients were more logical.  They had tribal
deities.  But you, my dear Lavelle, while you are satisfied with
your tribe on earth, claim that all Heaven is with you.  In one
of the old tales of our people it is told of two heroes that they
paused and embraced in the midst of their conflict.  They saw
noble things in each other. Life was a game to be played nobly as
indeed you play it;  but if you insist on Heaven as the ally of
your race you can only suppose that the forces of Hell are behind
your antagonist, and then there is an end of chivalry.  You
cannot weep over the fallen.  You can only curse them as that old
savage Dante denied pity to the spirit that uprose out of the
miry pool in the Inferno."</p>

<p>"But you have too subtle a mind to believe the soul of man is
completely isolated, is a being by itself and receives no light
except from the sun, stars, and lamp-posts."</p>

<p>"We exist, it is true, in some miraculous being which bathes
us, but I do not know whether it does not lend itself to my
whimsies, whether it is not a mirror of our being rather than we
of it. When I dream I create like a God, but I know my dreams
spring out of my desires.  Though they seem to melt into infinity
I know that infinity is an illusion in the hollow of my brain.  I
dreamed a few nights ago that I saw God, really an august being,
moving on His rolling throne through His dominions contemplating
His children the stars.  He came close to our earth, but had to
skip back very quickly, so high up were the shells bursting, and
the anti-aircraft guns were taking no chances with suspicious
luminosities.  He called me and asked, 'What is the trouble
here?' and I said, 'Lord, it is a spiritual conflict.'  'That
interests me.  Tell me all about it,' and I explained that the
people of the earth were at war to decide whether they would
receive their culture from such organs of public opinion as 'The
Horn of Empire' or 'The Clarion of the People,' and old God
looked at me and looked through me, and He burst out laughing,
and He laughed and laughed until the aether began rocking, and on
the waves of the aether the stars went dancing and scintillating,
tossing up and down in the wildest gymnastics, like corks on wild
waters.  I pretended to be amused also, but I really could not
see what the joke was about.  Then I awoke hearing people
laughing uncontrollably below my window, and it was that laughter
caused the dream.  It was a miraculous creation in a second, but
I know it sprang out of my humor.  You, if you dreamed, would see
a vision so beautiful that you would imagine it was a vision of
Paradise, but it would be no less of yourself than my fantasy.
That magical element which bathes us would have made itself for
you a mirror with the illusion of infinite reality, just as it
made itself a theatre and supplied the properties to stage my
ironic imagination. Perhaps that miraculous element which creates
illusions in us with such swiftness may be God, and It may like a
joke about Itself.  Now neither you nor Rian would admit my
fantasy was a divine revelation, though it was swift, coherent,
and complete, in fact as much a miracle as any vision of
Ezekiel."</p>

<p>"I'll admit it.  There is character and originality in it,"
said the artist.</p>

<p>"I would not despair, if I had time, of proving your
imagination an extension of the imagination of our ancestors,"
laughed Lavelle.</p>

<p>Leroy placed his hand affectionately on the shoulder of the
poet. He was an older man than any there, more master of himself,
and he was talking deliberately to lead a reaction of mood to the
normal after the fierce excitement of the struggle in which they
had been captured.  Leroy and Lavelle were men who lived by
intellect and imagination, and to the last their outlook would be
intellectual rather than bodily;  but there were some of the
prisoners who were realists and who had no interest in
metaphysical discussion, and these had been watching with
passionate interest everything in the city which could be seen
from the high windows from which they gazed.  There came a shout
from these, and all hurried to the windows of the great room to
see what new action was taking place in the drama in whose yet
unfolded finale their fate was hidden.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch4"></a>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<p class="first">
LAVELLE gazing from the high window saw at first only the
restless and ruddy glimmering of fire and shadow over the city.
But looking up he saw the vision which had excited his
companions.  The guardians of empire had sent a summons for
aircraft to overawe the revolting people, and they were coming, a
blazing caravan traveling across the limitless desert of the sky.
Not Babylon nor Luxor to overawe the denizens of their cities
ever created in the squat magnificence of their palaces such
images of power as these dragons of the air which drew up from
far horizons.  Irresistible and disdainful as eagles of a tumult
of earth-crawling mice, they floated with all their lights
displayed that the city might know what might overhung it. The
air, everywhere was vibrant from the deep purring of their
engines, and it shook as Heaven might have shaken at the opening
of the seals in the Apocalypse.  The heart felt strained
dreading, not individual doom, but the annihilation of cities and
races.  The conflict below was now too interknit for action, but
the ships floated high up like palaces of gods built on some
mountain slope of night, minatory to those who gazed and who knew
not at what instant the glow of life might be extinguished in an
obliterating rain from the sky.  From these aerial cruisers the
high admirals of empire overawed the subject peoples.  There was
nothing which could oppose them in the underworld.  Their crews
were apart from the earth dwelling races, made distinct by the
ecstasy of the high air they breathed, by a culture and poetry of
their own fully intelligible only to the air-dwellers.  Lifted up
by pride and united by a spirit which seemed almost a new
manifestation of cosmic consciousness, they regarded themselves
less as servants of the empire than as acting under a mandate
from Heaven to keep the peace of the world.  Their vision of
earth was wide and etherealized, for there were no frontiers to
the realm they traveled in.  Their isolation begot dreams
disdainful of the differences between races.  A world empire was
the only politic which harmonized with their mood, and they were
ruthless in suppression of revolt in territories whose people
remembered an ancient sovereignty over themselves.  Nothing
exasperates the spirit in man more than power which seems
unconquerable and which makes impotent all protest. One of the
prisoners cursed bitterly.  But with Lavelle, the poet in him
made him for an instant almost traitor to his nation, stirred as
he was by that vision of the culmination of human power soaring
above the planet.  The problem of the interpretation of cosmic
consciousness raised by Leroy recurred to him.  Was his sense of
an infinity in his emotion a criterion of truth, or was that
antiquity true that might indicated right?  Did the long overflow
of power through centuries into the organism of empire reveal a
harmony with cosmic purpose?  Or was that vast being in which all
life germinated as indifferent to the creatures which became in
it as the night which enveloped the passionate city in an even
calm?  The thinkers of his time had divined an all-pervading
element by which life seemed to be manifested.  By it everything
was born.  Thought and desire by it were translated into deed and
energy.  It lay between the seed and the corn, between the germ
and the fulfilled being. It seemed to vitalize the good and the
bad indifferently.  As a child equally pleased by flower or
glittering serpent, so this omnipotent child seemed to delight
equally in bringing to birth monstrous and beautiful forms in
nature.  That miraculous element withheld itself from nothing
which desired manifestation in nature or man.  To some, like the
poet, it gave the vision of beauty, and to others, to those who
floated so high in the aether, it gave almost an omnipotence of
power.  He felt how frail were his dreams for such a battle as he
was engaged in;  as frail as clouds cast aside like smoke from
the prow of an aerial cruiser.  Turning away with bitterness in
his heart he was aware of Leroy by his side.</p>

<p>"Leroy," he said, "I understand the stories of men who sold
themselves to a devil.  There are powers which seem as if they
would be overcome only by super-natural power.  What forces can
we summon up to deliver us from these?"</p>

<p>"Well by our death we may become supernatural beings
ourselves, and so assail our conquerors with legions of spirits.
The primitive believed he absorbed the spirit of the savage he
killed and added its force to his own, which perhaps meant that
he felt the foe within himself fighting beyond death.  Most of
our comrades are quite savage enough to continue fighting in that
way."</p>

<p>"Leroy, I can find no comfort in fantasies.  Can you, in the
evolution of world forces, foresee what may bring about the
downfall of power such as we see yonder in the sky?  We could not
submit to it.  We took the only way we knew.  We die and go out.
Yet I feel there must be a way even in this world by which right
may find its appropriate might.  If there be no way we are only
struggling against the nature of things."</p>

<p>"I think a revolt so widespread in the world must shake them
even up yonder in their heaven, and I do not believe the
influence of the dead on the living is altogether a fantasy.  The
victors in great wars have always been spiritually defeated by
the conquered. Rome came to be dominated by Greek culture, and in
the world war some centuries ago the last vengeance of the dying
German Empire on its conquerors was to imprint on them its own
characteristics. Your poetry and Brehon's History will be
favorite studies in imperial circles in a few years."</p>

<p>The poet smiled but faintly.  He was one of those who suffer
on behalf of their nation that agony which others feel over
personal misfortunes.  He pursued his meditation dreamily.  Why
did the Earth spirit inspire so many millions of its children in
such contrary ways?  Could a cosmic plan be divined amid these
opposites? Had Earth any dream of a culmination of her humanity,
or was there some trouble in the heavenly house, a division of
purpose among gods?  He might himself soon be absorbed into that
being, and in the light of that new dawn of consciousness his
thoughts were less about his own race and its immediate problems
than about ultimates. He might have pursued this obscure
meditation further, only the door opened, and two figures
appeared in the doorway, their faces dark and undistinguishable
against the light beyond.  They were thrust in by the guards and
the door again closed.  Out of the shadow one of the newcomers, a
huge figure of a man, came forward. The red light through a
window fell upon him and a cry of dismay broke from the
prisoners.  "Oh, it is Culain! Culain!" and they crowded about
the man by whose influence the workers of the nation had been
brought to take part in the revolt.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch5"></a>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<p class="first">
THE figure which emerged from the shadowy into the red air was
massive, noble, and simple.  It might have stood for an adept of
labor or avatar of the Earth spirit incarnated in some grand
laborer to inspire the workers by a new imagination of society.
To the workers this Culain appeared an almost superhuman type of
themselves, a clear utterer of what in them was inarticulate.
That deep, slow, thrilling voice myriads had listened to as the
voice of their own souls.  It affected Lavelle strangely as it
came, the one thing firm and tranquil, out of the excited mass of
prisoners.  Every figure in that group was momentarily changing
in, a moth-like flickering from pale to dark caused by the
leaping of flame or rolling of smoky clouds over the city.
Everything appeared, unreal, the room itself, face, limb, body,
mass, all that the imagination normally rested upon as solid
seemed vague and thin as dream.  Only that deep voice seemed real
as if it was the undisturbed voice of immortality.</p>

<p>"No! No!" that deep voice was saying.  "It is not over.  It is
only beginning.  It is an earth movement.  All that will topple
from the sky before it is over."  And he waved a hand towards the
glittering menace in the air.</p>

<p>"But we have no sky craft of our own!"</p>

<p>"If the roots deny sap the leaves fall from the tree.  They
have the air now but we have the earth.  We are not using
violence. We deny labor.  Every tributary which fed them with
power ceases to flow from today.  For a while they may rain
death, but they must descend and be as we are."</p>

<p>"I wish I could believe that," cried one.  "But their power
comes from sources beyond our control."</p>

<p>"This is not a revolt of two or three nations.  It is a revolt
of humanity.  To you it may be a rebellion of your nation.  To us
it is a revolution.  The workers of the world have dreamed
towards this for centuries.  They are organized and know now
their own power and their own hearts.  They wish nations to be
free, but they wish more to be free themselves.  We would not be
in this struggle merely to exchange world masters for nation
masters. The workers will have no master except their own
collective will. All who have tried to raise humanity from above
have only pressed more weightily on those below.  Those who are
beneath life alone can raise life.  Tomorrow no ships will leave
harbor.  No wagons will carry on land.  The air will soon be
empty.  The armies will starve if they fight.  Our terms of peace
are the surrender of the world to the workers of the world."</p>

<p>Here indeed was vaster trouble than the prisoners had planned,
or imagined possible, though they might have known that never did
one wild power awaken in the world but its kinsmen followed fast
as the wild riders follow one another in the vision of St.
John.</p>

<p>"It is a new tyranny," muttered Leroy.</p>

<p>"I am with it," cried Rian the artist.  "We will make
something out of this old world after all.  Culain, I will design
the most wonderful cities for you if we ever get out of this.  We
will build palaces for everybody.  I have always hated designing
houses for the rich.  It seemed like the sin of simony, selling
beautiful imaginations for money.  We artists built first for the
gods and we did our best work for them.  Since then we have built
for the Caesars, the aristocracies, and the oligarchies, and our
work was worse with every change of masters.  To work for the
world will, be like working for the gods again."</p>

<p>"The more masters you have the worse will it be," growled
Leroy.</p>

<p>"Cannot you see the majestic things harmony of effort makes
possible, old grumbler that you are?" said Rian.  "I have looked
at the remains of the Parthenon, and have sat for days brooding
over the ruins of temples in Egypt.  The people who saw such
beauty and magnificence must have been proud and uplifted in
heart.  However mean their original nature they lived in an
atmosphere of greatness.  That divine architecture must have
colored their thought as a sunset makes everything in harmony
with its own light.  If the empire had created beauty I might
have been with it.  I am afraid I could always be bribed by fairy
gold.  But it cannot create.  It can only suppress.  It
multiplies images of stupidity everywhere.  Beauty is flying from
the gray cities and the mean streets where people live out their
lives.  If this continues humanity will grow gray and ugly as the
world it lives in.  We will forget what beauty means. It will be
a word with lost meanings like the Etruscan inscriptions. You are
frightened at the idea of any kind of state as a mouse is of a
trap.  Such oppression as we live under I will revolt against
with you.  But I have imagination of a state of another
character. You are so much an individualist that you speak as if
every man was a distinct species of being by himself, that no
harmonious action was possible, and we were all as apart in
character from each other as the lion is from the tiger."</p>

<p>"We are really much more distinct from each other than animals
of different species are,"' Leroy retorted.  "One law for the
lion and the tiger would not be oppression.  They have the same
appetites. The lion and the tiger go one path to the pool to
drink and to the same covert to stalk the same prey.  Our souls
drink from a pool deeper and wider than ocean.  You and I see
different eternities. We have the universe to roam in, in
imagination.  It is our virtue to be infinitely varied.  The
worst tyranny is uniformity."</p>

<p>"Do you conceive of that being within you as indefinite in
character and purpose?" a quiet voice behind Leroy made question.
Lavelle, Rian, and Leroy turned.  They saw a tall, slightly
stooping man, white-haired, a face aquiline and eager, the dark
eyes with fire in them which turned from one to another
indicating unabated intellectual vigor.  It was the prisoner who
had entered behind Culain, but who had been overlooked in the
excitement caused by the entrance of so notable a personality.
The name of the newcomer was familiar to all, but Lavelle alone
recognized the historian of the nation.  "How do you come to be
here, sir?" he asked.  "You were not in our councils, though you
are the father of us all."</p>

<p>"Well, since you young men made a bible of my history, our
rulers seem to think it is better I should be out of the way
while the trouble you created continues."</p>

<p>"People think the state obtains information by incredibly
secret methods," said Leroy.  "I believe it occupies itself in an
incredibly unintelligent study of popular journals.  It is
sufficient for it to find a name there associated with a thing to
warrant arrest. But after all it only anticipates. If its
prisoners are not guilty before arrest they are ready to join any
conspiracy afterwards."</p>

<p>"I shall not regret my loss of liberty," said the newcomer.
"I am sure I would hear nothing so interesting without these
walls as I shall hear within them."</p>

<p>Fifty years before, when national sentiment appeared almost
extinct, Brehon, then a young man, proposed to himself to write
the history of his country, and in the labor of twenty years he
had unveiled so extraordinary a past, so rich a literature in a
language almost forgotten, that his work became an object of
passionate study by his countrymen, and what had been intended
almost as a funeral oration or panegyric over a dead nation had
the effect of rekindling it, and it came forth, young and living
from its grave.  The historian had been followed by creative
writers like Lavelle, in whom the submerged river of nationality
again welled up shining and life-giving.  The Youth of the nation
bathed in it, washing from their souls the grime of empire, its
mechanical ideals, and the characterless culture it had imposed
on them.  But after his history appeared the historian seemed to
take no interest in the great movement he had inspired.  He
became absorbed in more abstruse studies, the nature of which was
known to but few among his countrymen.</p>

<p>"I have for a long time thought revolutions spring from other
than the ostensible causes to which they are attributed, though
these may seem adequate.  Even in the moments I have been here I
have heard reference to principles which are not commonly
discussed. You," said the historian, addressing Leroy, "were
explaining some political ideal as being an extension of a
spiritual concept."</p>

<p>"Oh, if the people fighting without there had only known the
ideas Lavelle and Leroy discuss among themselves, there would
have been no revolt," said Rian.  "They would not have understood
what their leaders were talking about.  The room before you came
in was less like a prison for rebels than an academy of
philosophers discussing what relation the politics of time had to
the politics of eternity."</p>

<p>"Could we not continue that discussion and try to discover
whether political emotions are not in reality spiritual
emotions?" asked the historian.  "The poets and lovers before
Plato traced the divine ancestry of love, and other emotions have
been related by the mystics to divine originals.  Yet political
emotions, which are as profound as any, and are powerful enough
to draw the lover away from love, are not made sacred by
association with an Oversoul.  Historical and objective origins
are attributed to passions deep and absorbing as those evoked by
great religions.  We shall not sleep here tonight, I fancy;  and
how could we employ the hours better than by each telling as
between himself and Heaven what imagination about society brought
him to consider his imagination more important than life?"</p>

<p>"As between myself and Heaven," said Rian, "I believe I
desired passionately to build the palaces and cities of dream
here on the earth, and I wanted the prophets of beauty like
Lavelle to prepare the way in people's souls.  I never peered
inside myself except to search for unearthly compounds of stone
and mortar. But Lavelle and Leroy have probed deeper things in
their being. Lavelle will tell us what brought him from dream to
action.  We cannot spend the night better.  Tell us, Lavelle, how
the national idea turned a poet into a fighter.  You were moved,
I know, by impulses you never uttered to the crowds you inspired.
I suspect you talked, like Moses, to gods upon the
mountains."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch6"></a>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<p class="first">
"WHERE else," answered Lavelle, "but on lone earth or mountain
come inspiration, and how but by divine visitations, whisperings
and breathings from the dark were nations inspired?  Every race,
Greek, Egyptian, Hindu, or Judaean, whose culture moves us
deeply, looked back to divine origins.  My  belief in such
inspirations has, I confess, been more I to me than the thoughts
about the nation I have shared with others.  But I do not know if
I can make clear reasons for my belief in an oversoul guiding and
inspiring our people.  You will agree, I think, that we do not
bring about revolutions because of the few people we may know
personally.  We do so because of the millions we do not know. And
I think it is true also that we are stirred less by the ideas we
make clear to ourselves than by the myriad uncomprehended ideas
and forces which pour on us and through us, which are hardly
intelligible to ourselves, which we cannot rationalize, but which
give us impulse, direction, and the sensation of fullness of
being."</p>

<p>"I guess what you mean," said Rian.  "I rarely designed a
building without imagination creating a city in harmony with it,
and from this piling up of fanciful cities in the imagination
comes the inspiration for the single house."</p>

<p>"Do you see the buildings in your imaginary city clearly?"
asked Lavelle.</p>

<p>"I do in part.  Sometimes I can see the sun shining on
architrave, carving, or pillar, casting clear-cut shadows.  This
I think strange and wonder how it all was born in me.  I often
feel a mere craftsman employed by a supernatural architect to
carry out a few of his prodigal designs."</p>

<p>"You believe," Brehon asked of Lavelle, "these intuitions
about the nation have their origin in a being which has an
organic life of its own, just as the half-perceived buildings of
imagination with him give the sense they are really complete like
a city in the heavens before he becomes aware of them?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I think that is a parallel.  But Rian, for all his
vision of cities, would find it difficult to draw in detail one
after another the buildings he surmises in that architectural
atmosphere around the one building he concentrates on.  It is no
less difficult for me to give substance to a multitude of
feelings, which, if I pass them through a filter of words, will
not sound like planetary murmurs, though I feel they come out of
the soul of the world.  I will try, however, to isolate some of
these moods and interpret them.  I feel it is easier now to do
this because here we are, it may be, in the antechamber of death
where unrealities are rare visitors.  Here I find the thoughts I
shared with others fade in power and the spiritual concept of
nationality alone remains with me."</p>

<p>"I think we shall have some light on the problem how
theocratic states were born," said Leroy. "Lavelle is an
antique."</p>

<p>"It is a long history, beginning when I was a boy," said the
poet, who accepted the ironical comment of his friend with good
nature. "You remember, Rian, our holiday among the mountains? One
day you wished to climb to the top of the hill, and I would not,
and you went on and for hours I was alone.  But as I lay on the
hillside I was no longer solitary, but smitten through and
through with another being, and I knew it was the earth, and it
was living, and its life was mingling with my own.  Some majesty
was shining on me all the day, nodding at me behind the veil of
light and air, or playing hide and seek within the shade, or it
was in me as a spirit beseeching love from my own.  It seemed
older than life, yet younger and nigher to me than my own
boyhood.  I lay there drenched in the light and all the while
imagination, as a cloud which wanders between the Earth and
Heaven, was wandering between my transience and some immortal
youth.  I can remember that magical day.  I can see the white sun
blinding the sky, and light in dazzling cataracts outpoured and
foam from cloud to cloud, and the earth glow beneath an ocean of
light with purple shaded valleys, and lakes that mirrored back
the burning air, and woods vaporous as clouds along the hills,
and jutting crags, and mountains hewn in pearl, all lustrous as
dream images and all remote as dream. Earth had suffused its body
with its soul, and I lay on the mountain side clinging to it in a
passion.  When Rian came down I heard his voice beside me as from
an immense distance calling me back to myself;  and I was
irritated by his coming for I wanted to be alone with that spirit
which had found me."  "Oh, I know," groaned Leroy.  "If nature
catches the soul young it is lost to humanity."</p>

<p>"No, no, the Earth spirit does not draw us aside from life.
How could that which is father and mother of us all lead us to
err from the law of our being?"</p>

<p>"The earth may be our mother," retorted Leroy, "'but I am sure
it is not our father.  We get intellect from something beyond
planets or sun."</p>

<p>"Be quiet, Leroy," said Rian, "we will hear your reasons for
revolution later.  I am sure they will be the maddest of all,
though Lavelles political  thinking appears to me to begin in
very abstract regions."</p>

<p>"No, there are the true realities," cried the poet.
"Abstractions begin when we get away from the Earth spirit, which
has begotten us. Out of it have come plant; animal and
man&mdash;all real things.  Do plant and animal arrange their own
evolution? Does the flower dream its own color and scent?  Does
the bee devise its own wings or the polity of the hive?  Are we
less exempt from that dominion over our ways?  Since I was born
some wisdom, never sleeping though I slept, was in me, and cell
by cell I was fashioned and woven together and over my making I
had no control.  We dwell in the house of the body but its
perfection and intricate life are the work of a wisdom which
never relaxes dominion over a single cell.  I believe that wisdom
is within the soul to guide it.  It is ready at every instant to
declare to us the evolutionary purpose.  It has planned for us a
polity as it has planned for the bee the polity of the hive.  We
are higher than plant or animal.  We can be conscious co-workers
with the spirit of nature.  We fall into unreal fantasy or thin
abstraction when we think apart from it.  We are empty as a
vessel turned down-ward which fills itself only with air.  If we
think with the Earth spirit our souls become populous with
beauty, for we turn the cup of our being to a spring which is
always gushing.</p>

<p>"The Earth spirit speaks with one voice to you on your
mountain and with another voice to some solitary in a desert in
Araby."</p>

<p>"The Earth spirit throws itself into innumerable forms of
life," answered Lavelle.  "Did you expect it to make its children
all of one pattern?  For every race its own culture.  Every great
civilization, I think, had a deity behind it, or a divine
shepherd who guided it on some plan in the cosmic imagination.
'Behold,' said an ancient oracle, 'how the Heavens glitter with
intellectual sections.'  These are archetypal images we follow
dimly in our evolution."</p>

<p>"How do you conceive of these powers as affecting
civilization?"</p>

<p>"I believe they incarnate in the race:  more in the group than
in the individual;  and they tend to bring about an orchestration
of the genius of the race to make manifest in time their portion
of eternal beauty.  So arises that unity of character which
existed in the civilization of Egypt or Attica, where art,
architecture, and literature were in such harmony that all that
is best seems almost the creation of one myriad-minded
artist."</p>

<p>"But," said the indefatigable Leroy, "your world spirit does
not merely inspire variety of civilization in Greece, Egypt, or
China, it inspires individuals in the same country to work in
contrary directions.  How do you distinguish among varieties of
national ideals those which have the divine signature from the
rest?  How do you thus distinguish your inspirations from those
of my Dark Angel?"  It was as a Dark Angel Leroy wrote his
fantasies.</p>

<p>"It is difficult to answer you," said Lavelle, "and if there
was a general certainty in human thought I might be regarded as
foolish to risk life because of momentary illuminations.  But to
all of us life is a mystery, and we are like Columbus who was
encouraged to venture further on the unraveled seas because he
saw a single leafy branch floating on the water.  We likewise
dare all things if we hear a horn blown from some height of being
and remember that some who lived before us reported that they too
heard that horn.  We have control over the work of our hands but
little over the working of the soul.  But yet we must yield to
it, for without it we have nothing.  You or I may write something
and others will say of it that there is a mastery over our art;
or Rian may design a building all will applaud for its beauty;
but the fountains of thought or vision are not under our control.
If vision ceased suddenly with you or me how could we regain it?
If ideas did not well up spontaneously from some deep none of us
would know how to trap them, so far beyond conscious life is the
true begetter of thought or vision.  We would appear to ourselves
to have no real being but for the continuity of character of the
ideas which well up within us. Because of this continuity and
harmony we infer some being out of which they arise.  I have come
by a round-about way to answer your question.  As it is by the
continuity of character in our ideas we infer a soul in
ourselves, so it is by continuity and harmony of inspiration in a
race we distinguish those inspirations which come from the
national genius from ideas which are personal.  I came but slowly
myself to see these distinctions, for many years passed before
imagination and feeling passed into vision and I began to see in
that interior light figures which enchanted me with their beauty.
These were at first mythological in character and I could not
connect them with anything in the world.  Then I read the history
of our nation, and I was excited by that tale which began among
the gods, and from history I turned to literature, and it was
then I knew the forms I had seen in vision had been present to
the ancestors thousands of years ago, and ever since they had
been in the imagination of the poets.  I felt the continuity of
national inspiration, that the same light was cast upon
generation after generation just as the lamp in that high window
casts a steadfast glow and shape on the smoke which hurries
past," and he pointed to the ruddy coilings of smoke which flowed
by a high building beyond the square.</p>

<p>"What do you mean when you describe forms as mythological in
character?"</p>

<p>"There are certain figures which appear continually in our
literature, spoken of as a divine folk, apparitions of light
taller than human, riding on winged horses, or shining musicians
circled by dazzling birds, or queens bearing branches with
blossoms of light or fruit from the world of immortal youth, all
moving in a divine aether.  These were messengers of the gods and
through these came about that marriage of Heaven and Earth in our
literature which made it for long centuries seem almost the
utterance of a single voice.  These divine visitations have been
the dominant influence in our literature so that our poets have
sung of their country as the shadow of Heaven.  The hills were
sacred, the woods were sacred, and holy too were the lakes and
rivers because of that eternal beauty which was seen behind them
as the flame is seen within the lamp.  Political thought with us
too has been more inspired by the national culture than by the
economic needs which almost completely inspire political activity
elsewhere.  But why should I try to convince you of the reality
of national character? Has it not been noted by all who come to
us?  If we had not been restrained by alien power from control
over our own destiny we would have manifested the national genius
in a civilization of our own and it would have been molded nearer
to the divine polity.  While all can see the unity of mood and
character I am perhaps alone among you here, though not alone in
the nation, in believing it comes from the soul of the world.
Such beliefs are perhaps above proof, though we may know the
truth after tomorrow's sun has set, falling back into that
fountain from which we came."</p>

<h2><a id="ch7"></a>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<p class="first">
"I FAIL to see Leroy a harmonious bee in the divine hive,"
said Rian slyly glancing at that personality.  "I remember a
temple wall in Egypt all solemn with immemorial forms, and some
ribald ancient had scrawled a comic crocodile upon it.  Leroy
would be a creator of comic crocodiles in your scheme of things,
Lavelle.  I am trying to imagine him the slave of the inner
light.  But&mdash;" he broke off laughing.</p>

<p>The other was intellectually indignant.  "I am the slave of
the inner light," he said.  "But I do not wish to be the slave of
the inner Lavelle.  I do not know why you delight to see
everywhere the echo of a single mood.  I take joy in Lavelle's
imagination, in yours, and in all free imagination, but you
desire to impose your dream on others.  I, if I met a man with
imagination like my own, would turn my back on him.  I believe
the emanations of all creatures are poisonous to themselves."</p>

<p>"Well, I am with Lavelle.  There could be no place for my art
in the world without the aid of others.  Architects by themselves
do not build cities.  Nor would we continue imagining a beauty
which could never be manifested.  This must also be true of
statesmen. They could not go on with the noble labor of
civilization unless there was to be harmonious effort among many
to bring it about."'</p>

<p>"An idea may be heaven inspired, but is the will to enforce it
by violence part of the inspiration?" the historian asked of
Lavelle.</p>

<p>"Every idea which arises in the heaven world of consciousness
must ally itself with an appropriate force if it is to be born in
this world.  When we devise anything for ourselves our thought
allies itself with force to move the body, and in carrying out
what we devise we must often suppress energies and passions which
would impel the body to contrary action.  So the national genius,
if it is to move the body politic, must ally itself with force to
overbear what is hostile to it.  How else can right find its
appropriate might?  How could national genius create a
civilization if an alien power controls the economic and cultural
activities of the people, if it substitutes in youth a mongrel
culture for the national culture?  How but by force can the
nation free itself from a power which has taken the sceptre from
it, which has killed its noblest children and broken up its laws?
Now, being in peril, it would force us to fight for it, to fight
for the power which enslaves us. So," added Lavelle bitterly,
"might a man who had violated a woman, on the ground of this
enforced intimacy expect the woman to sacrifice herself for him
ever afterwards."</p>

<p>"You spoke of a mongrel culture.  Did you mean an alien
culture only, or had you another meaning?  Do you contend for the
superiority of the culture of our nation over the culture of all
other races?"</p>

<p>"Could we argue for the superiority of poet over musician and
having decided this ask poet or musician to express themselves in
the superior art?  No, we realize that natural aptitudes are not
interchangeable, and each person must of biological or spiritual
necessity practice the art for which he is fitted.  If there be a
true national culture it is best for the nation.  It associates
what is manifested with what is yet unmanifested in the soul of
the country, and tends to draw down from heaven to earth a
complete, embodiment of the divine idea.  I feel it to be true
about poetry that it is born in the dream consciousness and made
perfect there before it enters the waking consciousness.  If a
verse or even a line I think beautiful sounds in my brain, I know
that by brooding upon it.  I can draw down the complete poem.  I
think in the same way when we brood on what is beautiful in the
dream of the ancestors we attract out of the deeps of being all
beauty which is akin to it.  But to argue about the abstract
superiority of cultures would be to enter upon a futile
controversy like an argument between ants and bees over their
civilizations, as if those who had the worst of the argument
could change their species."</p>

<p>"Yet there are no biological distinctions between men such as
divide ants from bees.  The literature of other races we
understand as we do our own.  Nothing which is human can be alien
to humanity."</p>

<p>"We can draw inspiration from other races, but their culture
can never be a substitute for our own," said Lavelle.  "The
wisdom of others is full of danger, for we may lose what is ours
and break up our natural mould of mind.  A Chaldaean oracle
uttered a warning against changing the ancient names of evocation
in a country because such had a power affixed to them by the mind
of the Father. A national culture evokes by association of ideas
a thousand moods which an alien culture, however noble, cannot
evoke because the symbols and forces referred to are not always
present in us.  If all wisdom was acquired from without it might
be politic for us to make our culture cosmopolitan.  But I
believe our best wisdom does not come from without, but arises in
the soul and is an emanation from the earth spirit, a voice
speaking directly to us dwellers in this land.  We are among the
few races still remaining on earth whose traditions run back to
the gods and the divine origin of things.  There have been men in
every generation who have seen through earth as through a colored
transparency into the world of which this is a  shadow.  Hence it
comes that our land, the earth underfoot, is holy ground.  In the
earliest mythological tales the sacred mountains, lakes, and
rivers are named.  And why were they sacred?  Because there, as
on Sinai, men spake with divinities;  or, starting hence, they
were visitors to the Country of Immortal Youth, and returning
reported of it that it was not far off but near and it was
accessible to all of us.  Even where the literature is unread
something of the tradition remains with the peasant, and at times
he has vision so that he sees in waste places the blaze of
supernatural palaces, and people look out upon him with eyes
which are brighter than human.  He broods on such things, and in
dream he visits the world he broods on, and there arises from
this a commingling of natures, and a certainty about spiritual
things, and the soul follows a true path and is not led into the
<em>maya</em> of abstractions.  I know there are few now who
travel on the primeval highways of being, and they have become
tangled byways for most, and are rarely traveled, but still the
way to those who walk in light is known and I would preserve what
remains of knowledge so that we may continue to draw from out our
own well of wisdom.  In countries where they have lost the
primeval consciousness of unity with the earth spirit they either
have no mythology and cosmogony and thought is materialistic, or
else they go to Greek or Jew for their spiritual culture.  So
distant lands are made sacred, but not the air they breathe;  not
the earth underfoot.  A culture so created has rarely deep roots,
for its is derivative, and nobody can climb into heaven by its
aid, and it is of such cultures I spoke as mongrel.  We find
something false even in the greatest masterpieces of such
literature.  We admire the grandiose style of Milton, but feel
his heaven-world is rootless and unreal and not very noble
phantasy.  We wander in such literature into many palaces of the
soul where there are no windows looking out into eternity, and
their beauty at last becomes a weariness to us, for we seem for
ever to be imprisoned in personal phantasy, and we come to think
there is nothing but individual life and the race drops out of
the divine procession.</p>

<p>"The roots of your being seem remote from humanity, Lavelle,
though I have heard you move crowds as deeply as Culain.  Your
heart, I think, you use only on public occasions, but privately
its temperature seems a little Arctic."</p>

<p>"Were we not to discuss our ideals as between ourselves and
Heaven and the relation of our politics to the politics of
eternity?" Lavelle defended himself.</p>

<p>"I have tried to make clear to you where I think the Spirit
breathed in the deeps of my being and what ideas of our destiny
arose in me. I do not think I am unconcerned, about the quality
of human life. Why am I here?  Why did I take a part in this
revolt?  I saw a spiritual culture being extinguished and a
materialistic and ignoble culture being imposed on us to the
degradation of human life.  I believe humanity divine at its
root.  Out of this root comes beauty, intellect, imagination, and
will.  Out of this was born everything we adore in humanity.  The
heroes of our own race, all those we hold in our memory, had this
half divine character.  They were transparent to spirit.  Though
I believe with the apostle if we find the Kingdom of Heaven
within ourselves everything else will come to us, yet if I had to
build up a social order and could not wait for the slow evolution
I would begin it with consideration for the poorest first and I
would have Culain as my architect."</p>

<p>The Socialist leader, a huge figure half hidden in shadow, had
been listening with head bent as if brooding doubtfully over
ideas remote from his own but which came by long detours to a
sudden harmony in action.  He lifted up his head as if he was
about to speak, but out of the silence which followed Lavelle's
words there came a disdainful voice.</p>

<p>"All this is very well in poetry.  Our wives and daughters may
read such things in pretty books.  But what a basis for world
politic!  Such imaginations as these may allure romantic boys and
girls, but Nature does not endow them with vitality. The tribal
communities are gone behind time irrevocably and are like fossils
in human memory."</p>

<p>The prisoners peered into the shadow.  The voice came from
Heyt, the president of the great air federation who had been so
strangely thrust into their company.  The world state was here to
defend itself from its rebels.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch8"></a>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<p class="first">
THE disdainful voice went on, "You are intellectuals, in your
political thinking like those mathematicians who pursue the
elements beyond aether into mathematical space, and when their
calculations are worked out are unable to find the material
analogue of the result.  You have lost relation to the body
politic, and political thinking apart from an organism is futile.
The intention of Nature is seen in the forms it creates and not
in the dreams of its creatures.  The kid which hears a lion
roaring may desire limbs of a colossus and a neck powerful to
toss like the rhinoceros, but does Nature therefore enlarge its
stature?  You cry out against the world state which Nature has
made like the lion, but the will of the world soul is seen in the
organisms it endows with power.  The might of an organism is a
measure of its rightness, for no organism could grow to power
through centuries maintaining itself against the evolutionary
purpose.  The upholding of a regional ideal is like the display
of a ruined house inhabited by a few shadowy ghosts.  If Nature
was with your thought it would have bestowed power on it, but the
world soul has decreed the world state."</p>

<p>"That decree," an angry voice protested, "if ever was made, is
now annulled in this city and over the world," and there was a
clamor of prisoners repudiating Heyt's interpretation of cosmic
purpose.</p>

<p>"Our discussion would be unprofitable," said the historian
finally, "if it became merely controversial as to the outcome of
the present conflict.  Our fellow-prisoner was explaining why as
between himself and Heaven he is for a world empire.  Should we
not listen to him also, for, if fire falls on this city from the
sky ships, he may be a fellow-traveler with us to the great
Original, and I think myself in every dream and hope of man there
is some story of the glory of that King."</p>

<p>"Well," said Leroy, "I am ready to hear any politic discussed.
It would be one of the finest ironies of life if he converted
any, and they were brought out to die for the nation having just
become initiates of the empire.  Go on, sir," he said to Heyt. "I
represent individual as you collective humanity.  Perhaps our
extremes may meet."</p>

<p>"How does this power enter the organism of empire?" the
historian asked of the imperialist.  "An avalanche gathers power
as it slides down the mountain, and a man may gather power
momentarily from the summoning up of the baser passions of his
nature.  You will admit power may be generated in many ways, but
you, in your use of the word, implied purpose and an overflow
from the world soul."</p>

<p>"I find the design of Nature in the organisms which have birth
in it, and from the energy which fills them I divine their future
development,"  Heyt made answer.  "The power I spoke of does not
lie in the generation of mechanical force but in the minds which
organize control.  Nor do I think the intellectual power which
comprehends natural law and uses cosmic forces low in the scale
of human faculties.  There are many with such wisdom in the
service of the world state.  Why?  Because their science has
revealed to them the unity of law and the harmony of power which
make the universe a solidarity, and their politic is to make this
unity self-conscious in humanity.  Minds with this idea leap to
each other as atoms of the same element leap to each other in the
chemistry of nature.  I felt what I believe to be cosmic
consciousness stirring in myself and others when organizing unity
of control in the many fleets which had roamed the air.  Before
that each had brought into an element with no frontiers petty
ideas of nationality born in regions bounded by hill, river, or
sea.  What place has nationality in the  limitless sky, and yet
the little nations, if permitted, would proclaim territorial
rights in the aether up to the infinite.  The cosmic
consciousness manifests in the world state and to it these tribal
distinctions are invisible."</p>

<p>"If you get at a sufficient distance from Earth," said the
ironical Leroy  "it also will disappear and need not be
considered.  At present altitudes only humanity is
invisible."</p>

<p>"Humanity has heights and depths which are invisible to each
other. It is possible the heights may seem inhuman to the
depths," retorted Heyt, equally ironical.</p>

<p>Leroy persisted, "Lavelle interprets cosmic consciousness in a
sense contrary to you.  I think you both err.  I heard a street
orator zealous for souls interpreting cosmic consciousness in his
own fashion:  'In that last dreadful day,' he cried, 'God will
flout at you.  He will point His finger at you.  He will say,
"Ha! ha!"  You had your chance.  You would not take it.  Now you
will go to Hell!" You and Lavelle are more dignified.  You do not
create Deity in the image of the corner boy.  But are you less
anthropomorphic in your conceptions?  You justify the molding of
humanity to your will by imperialism in the heavens.  I believe
in the intensive cultivation of human life and think the cosmic
purpose is seen in the will of myself and others to be individual
and free.  The cosmic consciousness I conceive to be an autocracy
gradually resolving itself into a democracy of free spirits.  You
would make me the slave of a light I do not see, a law I do not
know.  How is cosmic consciousness to be recognized when it can
be so variously interpreted?"</p>

<p>"The interpretation," said Heyt, "which is most in consonance
with Nature has first claim to consideration.  To men of science
the universe is demonstrably under the dominion of unalterable
and inflexible law.  And it can be sustained in argument that
apprehension of that law is the only light of cosmic
consciousness in man.  I perceive you hold democratic ideas, but
where in Nature do you find traces of democracy to justify you in
surmising it in supernature?  Do you suppose the heavenly host is
a democracy and planetary affairs are arranged in council as with
men in some petty commune?  If you think so argue it out with the
mathematicians."</p>

<p>Every one in this age sought for the source and justification
of their own activities in that divine element in which matter,
energy, and consciousness when analyzed disappeared.  It was an
era of arcane speculation, for science and philosophy had become
esoteric after the visible universe had been ransacked and the
secret of its being had eluded the thinkers.  Heyt was high in
the councils of the world state.  On such men as upon deities
converged all the forces of protest, and to them also came all
that was to be said in support of state policy by the thinkers
who, as priesthoods have always done, supported established
authority.  The prisoners were irritated by his tone as of one
speaking from an immense height, who could with difficulty
discern the ideas stirring in the world beneath him.  But the
historian in his endeavor to relate political moods to their
spiritual ancestry went on.</p>

<p>"To perceive law in Nature does not of necessity lead to the
conception of a world state.  Where do you get natural or
supernatural justification for your denial of freedom of
evolution to so many millions?  On what truth do you rely to
balance all that curbing of life?"</p>

<p>"On the unity of Nature," was Heyt's answer.  "Has not our
science tracked the elements back to one primordial substance,
and the forces operating in Nature to one fountain?  Our science
in its theory and practice is based on these conceptions.  Our
politic in its theory and practice rests also on these
fundamental unities. Through the world state humanity moves
upwards to its source and becomes conscious of its own
majesty.</p>

<p>"It is the begetter of very bad art," interrupted Rian.  "I
refuse to believe there can be truth in the spirit which does not
create beauty."</p>

<p>"When the building is well built we may think about the
decoration."</p>

<p>"Beauty is not decoration.  If it is not in the design, if it
is not laid with the foundation stone, it will never be in the
completed edifice.  Where there is no beauty there is no
spiritual authority.  You shall not rule us with that story until
the words you cry even in wrath break in a foam of beauty on the
ear."</p>

<p>"Possibly," said Heyt scornfully, "you are mourning so much
over the ruins which must be removed that the design of the world
state is to you invisible.  I have no doubt the scrub which
withers under the shadow of a great tree can see no shapeliness
in the strength, which pushes it aside and denies it sunlight.
But the decay beneath fertilizes the forest.  Nature works the
material into higher forms. The world state will absorb its
romantics and transmute emotion into wisdom.  The change of phase
is inevitable as the change from childhood to manhood."</p>

<p>"How can the state be an organism in the sense that I am?"
cried Leroy.  "Is there anything affecting simultaneously its
disconnected cells?  With us the cells are knit and thrill
together.  In what sense other than mere metaphor is the world
state an organism at all?"</p>

<p>"The state is a true organism because its units exist in an
element which is the vehicle of emotion and thought, so that the
units vibrate together.  Have you never seen an orator by his
magic make one creature, of which he is head and heart, out of a
thousand people?  Is that unity only brought about by the words
he utters? Do we not know that as water is stained ruby by wine
his passion colors the element which bathes his audience so that
they vibrate in unison.  This is an internal or psychic unity,
and by this they become for the moment as much one being as you
are.  The orator creates a temporary unity.  The state creates an
enduring unity. Every state begins with some powerful personality
more absorbent than others of the element which is the source of
power, and he gathers myriads about him as an atom of crystal
flung into a bath draws to itself the atoms of that element in
solution.  The organism so created continues until a higher phase
of consciousness is reached, and humanity instinctively turns and
regroups itself about the higher power, realizing a profounder
consciousness in the contact.   Human evolution is the eternal
revealing of the Self to the selves.  In the ancient world the
state had the character of the most powerful person in it.  The
state gradually becomes impersonal through science and the
comprehension of Nature whose energies are becoming self-
conscious in humanity.  Science now sits in the seat of Caesar.
It is sustained in power because through it life rises from
ignorance to wisdom and it clings to the revealer.  I do not
think your revolution will shake the unity of powerful minds
which control human destiny through the world state.  Your ideas
are weeds growing in the fields of being and they must be
uprooted like weed."</p>

<p>Heyt paused for a moment and there was a certain grandeur
about him as he continued:</p>

<p>"I know that I am part of an organism lit up by a cosmic
consciousness which shall rule the world.  Humanity has yet to be
born from the world egg but it shall be born by the stirring of
cosmic consciousness through all its units.  It shall control the
elements and extend its dominion illimitably through Nature."</p>

<p>"He will next threaten to subdue the Ruler of Heaven!" cried
Leroy fascinated in spite of himself.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Heyt turning on him, "we may storm His
Paradise!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch9"></a>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<p class="first">
"WITH such ideas," said Leroy gaily, "you will hardly be
welcome in the Kingdom of Heaven.  Though I would myself cast out
from that majesty all souls who would wriggle in as worms and
miserable sinners, insulting Heaven by their abasement before it.
Here you are an enchanting companion.  In prison you enlarge our
imagination. But you imprison our minds when you are free.  It is
true the orator may make a myriad replica of his own passion out
of those who listen to him.  But that does not prove he is right
or they are not fools. The state may create a more long enduring
unity of mood among minions but it does not prove that they are
not being dehumanized.  They become fractional elements in an
organism rather than complete beings. The more scientifically
efficient is the organism you create the more does it dominate
the units and remake them in its own image, and when has the mass
ever risen to the level of the individual?  Though there be one
thousand millions in your world state does totality equal one
Shakespeare?  I am with Lavelle in the struggle for national
freedom, and if the nation wins I shall fight in it for the
freedom of the local community and for the greatest richness and
variety in life. Prove to me that your world state is a human
organism, that the law of its being is the law of my being:  let
your multitude in action give me the inspiration I receive when
solitary, and I will consider it."</p>

<p>"The culture of the individual!  What is that but images and
shadows of happenings in mighty states?"  retorted Heyt.  "The
very words you utter are sparks smitten from the anvil of
civilization, and there has been no civilization apart from the
highly organized state.  You speak of the law of your being.  Do
you know what is the law of your being?  You would probably have
denied thirty years ago the being you are today.  Is there any
law for you which is not the law of my being and of all being?
Only egomania demands consideration apart from the species.  You
speak as if the individual mind could be a mirror of
infinity."</p>

<p>"It can," said Leroy calmly.</p>

<p>"It cannot be the channel of infinite power," said the other.
"If the Absolute could have manifested itself and become self-
conscious in an individual would it have created multitudes?  The
individual will is not a magnet powerful enough to attract the
mighty forces which are becoming self-conscious in humanity.
Without these energies operating in the human mind it would be in
a state of arrested development&mdash;be unable to transmute its
vision into being."</p>

<p>"What," asked the old historian, "is the nature of the power
you speak of and how is it to be discerned apart from the
individual energies we are endowed with?"</p>

<p>"The energy of universal mind, the fountain of all the
energies in Nature," was Heyt's reply.  "It is this we discern in
the highest human intelligences and they are conscious of
direction. In the great laboratories of the state men seem at
first to be absorbed in special studies, but, when they confer
later, they find their special labors were only contributory to
great discoveries made in common and all had unconsciously worked
to one end.  We have come to believe every energy and element in
nature has intellectual guidance, and the human mind can enter
into relation with the mind in Nature.  We are passing beyond the
stage where scientist or inventor harnessed Nature energies to a
mechanism and tapped them for power.  We are nearing the
possibility of direct intellectual control of these Nature
energies through a growing comprehension of their relation to
their own intellectual guiders."</p>

<p>"It is not science sits in the seat of the Caesars," cried
Leroy, "but the magicians.  We are coming back in a spiral of
three thousand years to the rule of magician and astrologer!"</p>

<p>"The ancients," said Lavelle, "comprehended and used spiritual
powers, but your science only uses material energies.  The
ancients attained to a divine vision and saw beauty in its very
essence where you only lay hold of some force like
electricity."</p>

<p>"If they indeed attained such a vision of the universe," said
Heyt, "it may have come by uniting their consciousness with the
very force you despise.  I believe this mighty force through all
its correlations and manifestations to be guided by intelligence,
and that intelligence is the artificer of the universe, of planet
and atom, of state and individual alike.  The more we understand
its operations the more does it enter into consciousness, and the
cosmic will reinforces our own.  We attain our fullest life by
becoming its slaves, for we can have no real being setting
ourselves against the cosmic will."</p>

<p>"You conceive then of cosmic mind shaping world history,
acting by its intellectual energy on us through a hierarchy of
powers and intelligences, and using the world state as its
vehicle because it has widest ramifications?"  Brehon asked of
Heyt.</p>

<p>"Yes. You may so state it."</p>

<p>"The design is to endow humanity with power transmitted from
higher to lower?"</p>

<p>"Of course as it is all Heaven inspired it is blasphemy of any
of us to question the wisdom of the interpreters of Heaven,"
cried Leroy raging.  "We know earth history even if we do not
know heavenly history.  A union of economic federations first
strangle national life, then they become international and create
world councils and at last dominate everything.  Then they
discover divine justification for autocratic rule.  It is all in
the cosmic plan!  You concentrate power in the hands of a few and
assert you are endowing all humanity with power and
intellect."</p>

<p>"Intellect in any organism must act from some centre," said
the imperialist.  "I have not asserted the evolution of society
is complete.  The body of a child is first animated by childish
passions.  The being of the grown thinker finally is thrilled by
the majesty of law.  Humanity as a whole will finally absorb and
be moved by those powers which are now the heritage of a few. The
power passes from mind to mind linking them by a common impulse
or will.  If there is revolt against the law the power will
overcome it or break it.  An allegory of this you may find in the
tale of the master who made a feast and invited all to it. When
they would not come he sent out into the highways and byways and
compelled them with an iron hand.  The freedom you conceive of is
a chimera. You were born without your consent being asked. Your
body, as another here has said, is shaped by a power beyond
yourself and you are in it as in a prison.  Only in a little nook
in your brain you nourish a fantastic conception of  freedom,
while every cell in your body, the air you breathe, the sounds
you hear, the vision of Nature you behold stir you with impulses
beyond your control."</p>

<p>"I am not certain that I did not, like Ulysses in the Platonic
myth, choose my own body," said Leroy, "or that through the labor
of ages my spirit did learn how to build it.  And I am certain it
is not for another to dictate to me thought or action."</p>

<p>"You claim too much for the individual from the universe."</p>

<p>"You see too little of humanity for a ruler.  It is easy for
you to be slave to your own imagination, and you think it easy
for others to be slave to the same imagination, but your world
state will be broken upon myriads of wills as rooted in eternity
as your own, as passionate for freedom as mine."</p>

<p>"I believe," said Lavelle, "it will be broken by the national
will because it tries to blot out the past of nations and would
substitute an arid and inhuman science for the infinitely varied
cultures which had enriched the world. You train men to run a
machine efficiently but they cannot guide their own souls.  When
the labor of their day is over there is a riot of uncultivated
senses, Walpurgis nights where everything that is obscene or
vulgar meets undisciplined by any memory of beauty.  I count it
the greatest of tragedies for a man that he should suddenly lose
memory so that he could not recollect what songs were sung about
his cradle, or the dreams of his youth, or for what ideal he had
labored.  And your ideals have brought on many nations the
greatest of spiritual tragedies for they lose memory of their
past and do not see the way they came and by what unnumbered
dreams they were led.  They lose the beauty of poetry, the
ennobling influence of heroic story;  and the cavalcade which set
out thousands of years before miss their destiny and wander
without spiritual guidance in a desert of vulgarity.  We have
rediscovered our ancient history, language, and literature, our
treasure-house or paradise of beautiful memories, and we resume
the pilgrimage to our own goal.  Other nations with us revolt
against the domination your world state would impose on them. The
river of national life though submerged for a while rises up
again.  The momentum of a thousand ages, the character and the
deep life created cannot be destroyed in a generation."</p>

<p>"The future is as living in eternity as the  past," said Heyt.
"It is destiny you oppose. Your revolt will not succeed.  Too
many myriads have been liberated from the tyranny of the past and
the narrow prison cells of its cultures which were but the
heaping up of fantastic and personal conception's.  The wisdom of
Nature which science reveals constitutes a true intellectual
culture which knits the whole earth together in a brotherhood
with universal Nature. Humanity can now speak one language.  Will
it return to the past&mdash;put on itself the ancient fetters of
frontiers, tariffs, and languages which hindered it from a
realization of its myriad unity? I do not think so.  Break, if
you can, us who brought about a world unity, but you will find
you can only continue our work.  You must pursue the science of
power which has made the skies as native to us as earth to our
ancestors, which made unending airways in great spaces, and
thronged them with a life which but for us had crawled beneath,
or had its movements limited by regional rights.  You speak of
beauty as if it had perished because of our science, but what
beauty ever glimmered in the imagination to equal the vision of
earth made possible by our art?  You can leave this city at dawn
and see the sun set in the valley of Kashmir at night, and you
can, if you will, picnic meanwhile on the Mountains of the Moon.
Oh, yes! to do this we trampled on a thousand prejudices, but we
created a magnificence of power earth has not before known.  You
see above you in air those who keep watch and ward for the world
state.  At a word they could destroy this city.  If they were
destroyed a thousand more could darken the day overhead for you
or illuminate your night.  What power can you invoke mighty
enough to overcome that power?"</p>

<p>"It will be overcome by pity;" came in answer the voice of
Culain.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch10"></a>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<p class="first">
"The power of empire," said the Socialist, does not descend
from any sky, but is earth born and sucked up from human depths
where millions pay tribute in labor and pain.  You breathe the
magnificence but do not feel the agony out of which it is born.
Pity for that human agony has grown until it has become mightier
than empire and has marshaled against it armies that are
numberless.  There are two among you here who find inspiration
outside the circle of human life for the deeds they do.  But I
believe humanity itself is its own absolute, and within itself
are its own fountains of beauty and power. Its destiny is to
realize its own nature and the unity inherent in that being, not
a unity imposed from without.  It cannot acknowledge as above its
own the beauty of another being, or allow another power to
dominate it.  You look outside humanity.  I look within it and
find its profoundest impulse is to itself.  Lavelle as a boy
began to dream about Heaven and Earth.  I as a child began a long
meditation about human life, for I was born in a city of many
millions, in the dark heart of it where the sunlight was gray
before it lit our faces, and the air before we inhaled it had
traveled through long leagues of pollution.  I lived in a
tenement crowded with necessitous life, in an abyss where most
had come to the very end of all, where there was nothing more to
be feared and there was that peace in pain.  It was there I found
pity lay at the root of our profoundest being and there was a
secret joy in self-forgetfulness. My first thought beyond myself
came because of an old woman who wept a quarter of an hour or so
before she died being unable to rise and give help to another.
That self-forgetfulness when the self was passing from life
seemed to me to be wonderful.  I have read poets who sung of
fabulous and magic things, of starbright, clear, immortal drops
of life, and how whoso drinks of that elixir has never fear of
death, nor sickness comes, nor anything which wounds.  But the
life which forgets itself turns to its true immortality, and in
that taming there is a deeper life than the poets have fabled.
The immortality they imagined was but a shadow."</p>

<p>"Oh, it is true, Culain," cried the poet, "it is true, that
was the deepest life.  We follow too much after shadows for their
beauty.  But we do so thinking we will become what we
contemplate."</p>

<p>"Take care, Lavelle, lest you be dragged out of yourself by
your virtues as other people are by their vices," Leroy warned
the poet. "Culain exalts pity over beauty or strength.  He would
lead you by that star into his fold.  You will find his humanity
has one soul with a single idea which is to sacrifice the many to
the One.  To sacrifice life!  That would be easy!  But to
sacrifice the self! To do that is to oppose nature, whose purpose
is to bring innumerable personalities into being.  It was the
labor of ages to bring us to be ourselves and it is no duty of
ours to hurry away from ourselves."</p>

<p>"To think like that is also to mistake shadow for substance,"
Culain went on.  "You dream you have a rich life when you only
have a multitude of ideas.  To think is not to live.  I believe
it is true we become what we brood on, and if it be true, then
only an image of life can give us life.  On what should we brood
but upon humanity, the only life we know?  I too have sat on the
mountains.  The Earth there did not whisper to me of a life of
its own:  but with closed eyes as I sat there came up before me
images and scenes of human life, not as external things, but as
souls they entered into and burned my very soul, and I
comprehended and felt agonies, aspirations, doubts, despairs, and
striving.  I saw in my vision that these souls were brighter as
they turned from themselves, and their shining darkened as they
clutched at the personal, and I knew the shining came because
they were rising to their fount. That this vision was of
realities I know, for afterwards I met some I knew first when in
an illumined deep of brooding.  I know we can open the soul to
that innumerable life so that it can reflect itself in us, and
truly we become it, for it is at its root one being, one Heavenly
Man manifesting in legions of forms.  I am communist and
socialist because I believe humanity to be a single being in
spite of its myriad forms, faces, and eyes, and there is only in
it such seeming separation as we find in our own being when it is
dramatically sundered in dream.  Whatever makes us clutch at the
personal, whatever strengthens the illusion of separateness,
whether it be the possession of wealth, or power over the weak,
or fear of the strong, all delay the awakening from this pitiful
dream of life by fostering a false egoism."</p>

<p>"You know, Culain," Leroy spoke earnestly, "that I love your
mind and heart.  You have vision but it is of a life so
innumerable that it can only be revealed in the simplest of
generalizations. You say humanity is one being, and you would
build on that formula a social order for the whole earth, a
social order where everybody possesses everything, and nobody has
anything, and the infinite complexities of human nature are
constrained into one mould of thought.  You have vision and you
see infinitude, but you cannot give your vision to those who will
build up your communist state. Your organization will be to them
an opaque idea, an end in itself, not an avenue to the soul.
Life by it will be constrained and limited, and there will be
unspeakable cruelty to the souls of men. The greater the
organization you build the more must it be governed by regulation
and formula.  It will force on humanity an iron brotherhood, a
brotherhood of force not of affection, and that would be the
deepest of the human hells!  You offer your candle of vision to
the blind.  But what use can it be to the blind except as a
bludgeon?"</p>

<p>"All this," said Heyt, "would merely result in a spineless
society dominated by vague emotionalism.  In every vital organism
there must be an element of power.  A grandiose conception of
society is a worthy aspiration.  Love will follow the swift and
strong but will not make itself its own ideal.  Nothing is
sufficient for itself, not even humanity.  It must still enlarge
its boundaries, because if it feeds on itself it will get thin
and weedy like herds where there is too much. inbreeding."</p>

<p>"I too think an imagination which is over humanity is engaged
in its molding," said the poet.  "Culain, you admit no influence
from Nature, though we come out of its womb, nay, are still in
its womb. That Nature in which we are bathed is our real nurse.
It is she who moulds us in clans yet in infinite variety.  When
we surrender ourselves to her how full of life we feel!  She
transmits to her lovers her own power of making beauty and
whatever is done by those who live nigh to her is lovely.  When
men live too long in great cities the cord which connects them
with the mother being is cut, and what becomes then is
misshapen.</p>

<p>The works of art conceived in cities are first hectic with the
colors of decay, and, lastly, there is nothing which has not
erred in every line from its natural beauty."</p>

<p>There was a friendship born of ancient enmity of ideals
between Leroy and Culain, and the latter may have considered it
useless renewing a controversy already plumbed to its depth
between them, for he began a commentary on Heyt's conception of
power.</p>

<p>"What is power?  To be able to move life as we desire?  We
call a ruler powerful who at a word can fill the sky with
armadas."  But what is it moves the ruler?  An emotion? a
passion? or a vanity? And those armadas which leap into air at
his will&mdash;what is the link between them and their ruler but
an emotion?   Such power at its root is on a unity of sentiment
or feeling among many.  What is it has made a hundred million of
workers withdraw labor from the world state?  What but a feeling,
pity for human life?  Can you arouse a deeper feeling than pity
to compel them to renew their labors?  I think too that as all
human power arises from feeling or desire so the forces in Nature
if we had knowledge of their mode of motion are also moved by
some desire.  Is there a chemist in your laboratories who could
deny that the affinity between atom and atom was not an affinity
of life with life rather than a destiny inherent in the mechanism
of their structure?"</p>

<p>"The will in itself is power," said Heyt.  "The will is the
self, the king principle in our being, and it orders all other
emotions."</p>

<p>"In the heroic tales of our people," said Lavelle, "one story
is more famous than the rest which tells how an aristocracy of
lordly warriors was rent asunder by pity for a beauty which had
been bowed to sorrow by their king.  Beauty itself exercises the
most sovereign power over the soul and the will bends before it.
There is a divine beauty which is overlord of our being."</p>

<p>"The beauty in humanity is inherent in it," Culain replied.
"As the beauty of a flower is hidden in the seed cell so the
beauty of humanity flows from its ancestral self, a mightier Adam
or heavenly Man."</p>

<p>"Do you conceive of that oversoul to humanity as conscious of
its unity with its children?"  asked Brehon, "or is its
consciousness of its unity now lost as we in dream are divided up
into This and That and Thou and I, and while we dream have not
the sense that the <em>dramatis personae</em> are but one
character?"</p>

<p>"I cannot say I know," answered Culain.  "I can only say I
believe, and yet I feel that that which upholds belief has
knowledge. I can argue here and make the plea for a communist
state so logical that it is without flaw, and it needs in this
world for its completeness no argument drawn from a deeper life.
Yet for myself I elect to be socialist not merely because logic
and justice unite in the theory, but because of a vision which is
incomplete, but which weighs more heavily with me than the most
perfect logic.  By faith only can I complete the segment I
perceive of the vaster circle of human life which includes the
Heavenly Man.  I know it to be true indeed that soul can have
vision of soul, not seeing only as the eyes see, but feeling the
being of another as we feel the passion of our own hearts.
Because of this the ancient Buddha commanded his followers to
meditate with love and sympathy on life in the four quarters of
the world.  This I have done for many years, and there broke in
upon that meditation intimate and poignant, the sense of myriads
of lives, and I saw and felt them as portion of myself, and they
burned my very soul."</p>

<p>He paused for a while as if he hesitated to reveal himself
further, but continued in his slow speech:  "Once at the height
of vision, overwhelmed with that intermingled life, I cried out
in my heart to know its hope and way and end, and in my vision
these myriad souls became transfigured, and all even the darkest
of them I saw as gods, all shining and ancient with youth;  and a
fire which was within them all seemed to consume them and draw
them into itself and they fled into it and disappeared or were
melted in darkness and rapture into that Ancestral Self."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch11"></a>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<p class="first">
"WHY do you speak of pity as the profoundest emotion in such a
being?" asked the historian.</p>

<p>"There are no words but pity or compassion to indicate
likeness to that feeling which, indeed is not so much pity as an
emotion of infinite desire, or the yearning rather of a life
limited and divided from itself for the being it has lost, and
which should be as much itself as the beatings of the heart.  As
between myself and Heaven it was the intuition of the unity of
humanity which led me to become communist.  Wherever in history
any were born with that knowledge life near to them reflected it
as in a glowing glass, and there was no fierce thought of thine
and mine. What was the polity of those who listened to Christ or
Buddha? Had they not all things in common?  They forbade warfare,
for they would not have the spirit at enmity with that which was
intimately itself, and they would overcome hatred by love.  Those
who are with me do not arm.  We separate ourselves from a social
order which is oppressive.  We deny it the strength of labor, and
when that is denied the old social order with its passionate
possessive instincts must crumble.  On its ruins we will build a
new social order restoring the world to humanity.  No one in the
new earth will have private property in the earth.  There will be
nothing to make men feel they have interests distinct from the
being of which they are part."</p>

<p>"I do not believe," said Leroy, "if you put devils in Paradise
they become angels.  If there are any heavens they must be holy
only because of things which are imagined there, not because the
streets are as fabled of gold or the gates of precious stones.  A
man may gain his soul by giving up the world, but if his share of
the world is taken from him by force it by no means follows his
soul will be paid him, as compensation.  I am skeptical about all
methods of achieving spiritual ends by material means.  You say
there will be nothing in the new social order to make men feel
they have interests distinct from the being of which they are
part.  You will never create such a world.  A man can be a
glutton upon a crust of bread as well as upon a Neronian banquet,
and if he has not great material possessions his vanity will glut
itself upon the shapeliness of his nose, or his ideas, or
anything else which is his."</p>

<p>"If we bring about the ownership of the world by the people of
the world, by the race, not by individuals, such a change is
itself evidence the inner attitude of the soul has changed,"
answered Culain. "The spiritual change comes and must come before
the material change. If it had not come the will of the workers
would not have been set upon this polity.  The collective will
acts in this way because its hidden throne is upon this interior
unity."</p>

<p>"You believe then," asked the historian, "that in some region
of our being we are conscious of unity with that myriad life?
Our being here you say is dramatically sundered as it is in
dream. Is there any sphere where this dream does not dominate the
spirit?"</p>

<p>"I believe," said Culain, "in sleep and death we go back to
ourselves, and the meanest of us here is there as a god.  There
have been men at all times who have known this to be true.  A
great religion based its psychology upon the unity of the soul
with all other life in that state which is dreamless sleep to us.
In one of its scriptures we are told of a sage who found an
outcast sleeping by the roadside, and he hailed that outcast by
heavenly names, 'Thou great one, clad in shining!  King!' and of
that outcast he said, so high was his being in sleep he was then
like a king moving among his dominions.  From that high being men
come forth every morning to take up and renew their cyclic labor,
which is to make the mightier Adam conscious in all its children,
and they of it as their oversoul and very self."</p>

<p>"You think the unity inherent in deepest being must at last
become conscious in our life here and express itself in a social
order and polity in harmony with itself?"</p>

<p>"I believe we are evolving to a state where the individual
life will reflect in itself the entire being of humanity.  The
heart will attain its own infinitude of feeling as our eyes have
already attained their own infinitude of seeing.  They reflect
the external universe with its multitudinous forms.  The soul
will reflect the internal world of multitudinous life.  When it
has attained this consciousness the polity of earth must be
transfigured.  Who then would grasp at sceptre or crown or
possessions for a self which he knows to be unreal?"</p>

<p>"I do not understand," said a prisoner who had listened with
puzzled face to the symposium."</p>

<p>"Never mind, Rudd," said Leroy kindly.  "Nothing Culain has
said need affect your faith in your leader.  It only means his
communism is more absolute than any one had ever imagined, and if
he has his way nobody will be able to call his soul his own."</p>

<p>"All this," persisted that prisoner obstinately, "seems to be
less our concern than the churches.  The priests can tell me
about God and the next world, if I want to know about them.  I
expect my leader to tell me how this world is to be made fit to
live in.  I do not like the mixing of religion with politic."</p>

<p>"The God you heard about in the churches died a very long time
ago," said Leroy.  "It is centuries since His voice was able to
be heard even in a whisper in the sanctuary.  It came to pass
that spirit fell into matter while matter was ascending to
spirit.  That means, my dear Rudd, that if you want to understand
business in its most subtle forms you must now go to the
churches.  If on the other hand you wish to understand the
heavenly things you must now consult the politicals."</p>

<p>"I do not understand," repeated Rudd.</p>

<p>"Well, if Culain's ideas are true you only need to fall asleep
to understand everything.  Here are two who are now like kings
moving among their dominions," said Leroy pointing to some
prisoners stretched asleep upon the floor.  He gazed on them with
a kind of exasperated admiration.</p>

<p>"I do not know whether I should praise them for their courage
or despise them for their indifference to living.  Here are the
last exquisite drops in the cup of life and they turn down the
cup.  I never enjoyed life more intensely.  It is worth while to
take Death as a companion because it brings out all that is most
alive in Life.  'Oh,' he cried, 'there are some people out there
who are living intensely."'</p>

<p>A thunder as of some vast concussion, in the city smote on
their ears.  It was followed by a flare which made momentarily a
wild illumination in the room.  The faces of the prisoners
gleamed in a magic moonlight of many colors.  The sleepers awoke.
All hurried to the windows.  The lofty night was pierced by a
thousand circling rays.  The airships were searching the dark
above and below, and the revolving beams made each appear the
fiery hub of a wheel whose vast spokes rayed out to some remote
and incalculable circumference, and these were the chariots of
gods rolling across the sky.  One of the rays rested on a little
mist overhead.  It surmised something sinister within it.  There
was a vibration in the air as if a brazen gong had been beaten,
and at that signal all the ray's converged on that mist.
Something fell from the cloud.  One of the great airships blazed
out as if stricken by fire and it dropped within the city.  A
fountain of flame leaped up where it fell, and there was another
fierce illumination of the room and of the staring faces of the
watchers at the windows, who all, breathless and still, were
intent on the spectacle in the sky.  Those aerial cruisers,
hitherto floating slumberously over the city, were now in wild
activity.  Rising to that higher dark where their enemy had been
hidden they became hunters of the heavens.  For that solitary
airship of the rebels there was no escape.  Soon it dropped like
a falling star.  There came a sigh as of pent-up breath escaping,
and then Rian broke the silence.</p>

<p>"Oh! that was heroic, that deed of our comrades.  With that
little ship to lie up there waiting for these giants and for
death!  That fall!  My heart went dropping with them.  Oh, what
was life to them in those ten tragic seconds!"</p>

<p>"I wonder," said Leroy, did consciousness fly from the centre
to the circumference, from earth to heaven?  Or did everything in
their being race to the centre in a mad concentration on the self
that was to perish?"</p>

<p>"All physical combats are a nightmare," Culain said, "hate,
despair, terror, every emotion called into being suck the soul
down and further away from heavenly being."</p>

<p>"No, no, it cannot be so with these," cried Lavelle.  "Death
was a terror sunken below far horizons ere they rose on that
adventure. The self had already perished for they had abandoned
themselves to the genius of their race and it was captain of
their souls.  The last of life they knew was the rapture of
sacrifice."</p>

<p>"I would like such an exit," said Leroy.  "Oh, from all that
would crowd on me I think I would know myself truly.  While we
live a thought hardly lights the brain ere it vanishes.  Our
emotions have but warmed the heart and they go.  They all hide in
caves, and we can be conscious of but the minutest fraction of
our being at any one time, never the whole being.  I think if I
took part in such an adventure the whole populace of thoughts and
feelings would rush out of their caves and I could be my entire
self if but for a few seconds.  Perhaps if they put an end to me
tomorrow I may have such an instant looking down a rifle before
it is fired.  I would not lose it.  What I fear is that these
airships will wreck the city, and I may go out without a moment
to arouse the habitants of my being so that they may all answer
the call and I may know myself in death."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch12"></a>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<p class="first">
"WHAT an epicure of the spirit!" cried Rian, "The feasts of
Heliogabalus are pale images of gluttony set by this desire to
swallow life in an instant.  I hope if I am shot I will not see
rising all at once before me the cities I might have builded. The
one thing which might make death bitter would be the thought such
imaginations never could be realized."</p>

<p>"You like the others want to externalize yourself.  I want to
internalize and be myself fully.  The end of life is to be, not
to do.  If your desire is to act all that is infinite in you will
try to drag others out of themselves to aid you in your labors.
You will try to build the world in your own image and there will
be no freedom.  The world can only be free when men are content
in themselves and each draws from his own fountain."</p>

<p>"Many people," urged Lavelle, "are born under one star and are
kinsmen of each other in the spirit and find themselves most
truly when they follow together that single light."</p>

<p>But Leroy would admit nothing which subdued the individual to
the group idea.</p>

<p>"When you speak of people following one star all that means is
that they are weak enough to surrender their individuality to
some more powerful than themselves.  Every man must be original
or be nothing.  Who is interested in the followers of greatness?
Were there any Christians worth thinking about after Christ?  If
we remember any it was because they revealed something in their
spirit which was not in the original gospel.  No life inspires us
because it is like another life.  I was once indeed converted to
a church, but it was in a dream.  I saw a procession in a squalid
street in the core of some grimy city, and a venerable old man
was there being consecrated as prince of his church.  He was
adjudged by it most Christlike;  and the highest dignity it could
confer on him was to name him prince;  to give him a garret in
those squalid streets so that he might live among the poorest
like his Master.  In that church of a dream all the priestly work
done by archbishops and other dignitaries was intrusted to the
newly consecrated for it was only business.  The profound science
of the soul was not for youth.  I remember in my dream cheering
that old man with the tears streaming down my cheeks, and then I
awoke and knew it was only a dream and could never happen in
life. Though the church endured for an hundred thousand years it
would never produce another Christ.  I do not believe a second
Christ could ever inspire the world as the first did, for time
has no story which inspires us when told a second time.  The
great spiritual clans, the great national clans, all try to cast
humanity into a single mould.  I am against the state as I am
against a state religion.  Nature in the infancy of the spirit
may have been behind the religions and the nationalities;  it may
have been in them as the spirit of the hive.  But in far ages the
time came, I think, when some unknown god whispered to man, 'Now,
you yourself, my darling, must create yourself by your own
efforts. The universe is before you.  Its powers are yours.  Take
whatever you can.'  We are to reverse the ancient process by
which Saturn devoured his children.  It is for the children now
to devour Saturn, and absorb the universe into themselves
individuality. The universe is infinite and there can be
infinitely varied personalities.  If there are differences of
character among you it is in spite of yourselves.  You are all
jealous in demanding adhesion to national dogma, imperial dogma,
or social dogma and you imprison the soul in little cubicles of
thought, the soul which might have grown into a myriad
wisdom."</p>

<p>"Oh, now!" Rian managed to interrupt the torrent of speech,
"you need not be so indignantly individual.  I remember a few
years ago you had built a civilization in your own head, and
wanted us all to come into it.  You were proud of it as
Nebuchadnezzar when he walked on the roof of his palace and cried
out, 'Is not this great Babylon that I have built?' "</p>

<p>"Yes, but I learned wisdom like Nebuchadnezzar.  My Dark Angel
told me the truth about that myth.  The great King found the
Babylon he created was only the shadow of himself, and he felt
solitary as the man who sees replicas of his own face in a
thousand mirrors, and he retired to the simple life.  I escaped
from the coils of the net.  I live and feed myself on an acre of
ground, but I am free and have the universe to roam in thought. I
measure men by the magnificence of their imagination, not by the
height of their cities."</p>

<p>"What is the universe to roam in if the spirit never meets its
own kinsmen?" cried Lavelle.</p>

<p>"Do you really so love to meet your spiritual kinsmen?" asked
Leroy slyly.  "I never found you so happy or animated with them
as with Culain or myself.  You liked us because of our
unlikeness. Confess, dear Lavelle, you were tired of your
followers.  They never enlarged the boundaries of your spirit but
only multiplied ideas you were already familiar with.  Should not
that lassitude have filled you with terror it the thought that
your enterprise might succeed and millions of many colored
characters be dimmed to one tone.</p>

<p>"I do not admit the lassitude," said Lavelle, smiling, "nor
the terrible character of the uniformity of thought you surmise
among my friends."</p>

<p>"Oh, I do not deny minor variations.  You permit variety in
the little things but not in the great.  The dogma of the nation
dominates everything and obscures the end of being.  You are like
people who can only look out on the world through a single
keyhole!"</p>

<p>"You know," said Lavelle, "I do not think national character
or culture is imposed on men from without by other men, but in
their highest form or spirit are the extension of divine
consciousness into the human.  You will not agree with me in
this, but you will admit there must be identities of thought or
culture among those who live in the same region, or else chaos or
mere anarchy, not in your sense but in the physical, will
follow."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, we preserve language which is necessary for
communication of thought as light is for perception of form. But
I do not agree that there need be more in common between the
souls of men than the spirit of kindness which reconciles all
things otherwise incompatible."</p>

<p>Here the historian interposed.  "You said something a little
while ago inferring an original unity for all living things. You
spoke of the universe as an autocracy gradually resolving itself
into a democracy of free spirits.  Can these spirits divest
themselves altogether of any relation to that being of which they
are emanations?  What is the relation?  You use language which
pre-supposes identity and yet you affirm separateness.  If there
be any dependence of your being upon heavenly being you must
surmise that relation for the rest of humanity.  And if there be
a link of identity of consciousness on some plane of being this
naturally would express itself in life.  Do you assume any
relation between Heaven and your spirit?"</p>

<p>"You may think of me as a rebel angel," answered Leroy.  "I am
in revolt against Heaven."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch13"></a>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<p class="first">
"I AM not averse to Heaven.  I confess an artist's longing to
see the fabled palaces, the gates of precious stones, and the
streets of gold which some rail at.  What is amiss with Heaven?
Is the government oppressive?" asked Rian, laughing.</p>

<p>"Leroy is lapsing into fantasy," said Lavelle.  "His Dark
Angel will not allow him to be long serious."</p>

<p>"Fantasy!" cried Leroy, "when I utter the thing I hold to be
most true, when I reveal myself most, you think I am not serious!
I am rebel against the Heaven to which in imagination, you are
slaves. You all rest on divine powers to which humanity must be
subservient. Yet it was to escape from their dominion over the
spirit I verily believe a migration set in from Heaven to Earth.
You assume it was in the divine plan.  Have you never dreamed it
might be our own primal will carried us here, that  we would not
be the slaves of light, and we chose free individual existence
full of agony even rather than spiritual passivity.  Do you
remember too Dante, overwhelmed in Paradise, Beatrice
speaking?</p>
<br>

<p class="verse">"What overmasters thee<br>

A virtue is from which naught shields itself."</p>

<br>

<p>When we gaze at the sun we are blinded to all else.  What
could the spirit be in Heaven but a mirror of that glory?  There
would be nothing for it but vision and it could have no being of
its own. What wisdom could there be for 'those who are pure by
birthright, who have not suffered or struggled nor willed in
freedom their own destiny.  We grow into a myriad wisdom through
aeons of pain, and by that wisdom we are higher than seraph or
archangel who have not wept as we have nor stayed themselves
against the cosmic powers. You read the scriptures of the world
but forget that the seers who revealed the architecture of Heaven
told us to fly from Heaven, and that the highest was not there,
and it seduced by its sweetness. Aeons ago the spirit of man
revolted against Heaven, but it has forgotten its primal will.
Heaven through the religions and philosophies and through
statecraft renews its lordship over the soul so that in all that
is done it defers to some divine power. Yet we have in ourselves
the seed of something higher than the Heaven you worship."</p>

<p>"The extremes have met!" cried Rian.  "The representatives of
individual as of collective humanity both dream of storming the
Heavens."</p>

<p>"That was the one thrilling thought expressed here," answered
Leroy, "But he will never storm the Heavens with an army of
slaves. The more the world state dominates humanity the more is
the will of the individual made incapable of powerful
effort."</p>

<p>"The Will grows stronger by self-suppression than in self-
assertion," said Heyt.  "In  the first case it truly overcomes
something.  In the other desire is mistaken for will, and the man
is most driven when he most thinks he is the driver."</p>

<p>"That," said Leroy, "is one of those subtleties which can be
uttered in a sentence but which need hours for their refutation.
I will say no more than this that the truth of it depends upon
what self is suppressed.  I hold your statecraft would suppress
manifestation of the deep inner being of man, and when that is
overlaid, when you have submission to the world state, there must
creep into society that stagnation, which is the precursor of
death.  Whether it be you or Lavelle or Culain achieves the
harmony of society individuality must be weakened, and the will
lose that diamond hardness which can only be maintained by
continuous effort never relaxed for a single instant.  If the
will be relaxed the powers we should oppose sweep like a tide
over the soul and carry it away.  We are then like one who has
rowed against the stream but who rests on his oars and drifts
back and loses all he has gained.  I have purchased freedom at a
great price, warring against all those who would draw me into an
unintellectual harmony with themselves.  I give no allegiance to
the principles you speak of as the divine beauty or power or
soul. If I am swayed by any deity it is some unknown god."</p>

<p>"Your unknown god is suspiciously like the ancient devil,"
said Rian.</p>

<p>"What, was the ancient devil but some still earlier deity,
some rebel of the Heavens who whispered freedom to the spirit of
man; who against all external rule urged on it still to persist,
still to defy, still to obey the orders of another captain, that
Dweller in the Innermost whose least whisper sounds louder than
all the cries of men?"</p>

<p>"Well,"' said Rian, "'it is heroic to, defy the universe.  I
admire even if I cannot follow.  For all your prickles, Leroy,
you are sweet at heart, and I wonder how all this was born with
you.  Had you a vision on a hill like Lavelle? or did you like
Culain find your heart the council chamber where humanity
met?"</p>

<p>"We all develop from the first contact of the spirit with the
body, and the governing myth in my life was a dream which was
born in me as a child.  I believe it came from the same primeval
consciousness from which welled up the Promethean myth, the
legend of Lucifer and the wars in Heaven and many another myth of
revolt, that mood in which the many eternally break from the One.
In that dream I was one of the 'Children of Light' dwelling in
Paradise.  Outside that circle, were the Children of Darkness
whom we knew not but they were rumored to us as dreadful and
abhorrent; and in my dream I wandered away from that Paradise
into lonely and interstellar spaces, and I was there overshadowed
by some dark divine presence, and I know it was one of the Host
of Darkness and I trembled.  But it whispered gently, 'We of the
Darkness are more ancient than you of the Light,' and of many
other things it said I recall this only, 'When most you rebel
against the known God the lips of the unknown God are tenderest
upon your forehead.'  That, without then understanding, I
remembered when I awoke, but because it was the first visitation
of the spirit it became powerful in memory and everything in the
conscious mind gathered about it, and at last I think that Dark
Angel became my Soul."</p>

<p>"From such fragile and gentle dreams what mighty movements in
the human mind begin!" the wondering Rian mused aloud.  "Lavelle
hears a whisper from the Earth-spirit in his native land, and it
becomes at last a sacred land, to him, and he fights as
desperately to keep it inviolate as the ancient Jews fought for
their holy city. Culain saw some one die who had forgotten she
had a self, and he began to remake the world in her image.  You
hear a voice in dream which hints of something higher than
Heaven, and you become the most potent scatterer of revolt
against all that men worship. Yes, I can see from the foundation
stone how grew up the whole architecture of your thought.  Talk
of beauty leading us by a single hair!  Here is a world in
revolt, and three who have each a multitude of followers
themselves follow phantoms that none other but themselves may
see!  O, earth whisper! dream of the heart! Dark Angel! who
visited these in childhood, do you know what a storm you have
created in the world?  I revolt against the evil I see and I
would replace it with a civilization and social order I see no
less clearly in the mind.  In the civilization Lavelle advocates,
or in the social order Culain would establish, I see how the
means provide a bulwark against the end to which they would lead
us.  The common mind of humanity can assert itself in council and
need go no further.  But to what anarchy of life would not your
philosophy bring us!"</p>

<p>"I never asserted," said Leroy, "because I protested against
human law that the universe itself was without law.  If we are
true to the law of our being Nature provides the balance.  Let us
all be individual, myriad-minded, godlike, acting from our own
wills and our own centres, and will Nature therefore be upset?
No, the law will adjust everything and bring about a harmony of
diversities. Lavelle, Culain, and Heyt want to do Nature's work
by providing a harmony of identities.  I think it was old
Plotinus who said that when each utters its own voice all are
brought into accord by universal law.  So I have absolute faith
that if we are ourselves fully we do not become enemies but see
more fully the beauty in each other's eyes."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch14"></a>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<p class="first">
A SILENCE followed during which Rian watched that prisoner of
puzzled countenance who could not understand Culain, and whose
expression indicated that now less than ever could he relate the
politics of time to the politics of eternity.  The sullen eyes,
knit brow, and impatient feet grinding on the floor, betrayed the
anger of one at home in practical action who finds himself
trapped in a web of incomprehensible abstractions.  The artist
nature in Rian, sensitive to moods, feared some outbreak of
exasperated common mentality, and he turned to the historian.</p>

<p>"Sir, I do not know whether in the long silence since the
completion of your history you have passed from the self which
was in that book; whether you have grown apart in soul from the
nation you did so much to raise from oblivion, and whether we now
seem to you to be vain necromancers in our endeavor to continue
its life.  I feel myself as if the earth was no longer firm under
my feet.  All these political ideas which inspire my comrades
appear to be but the psychic body of ideas descended from heaven,
but which have no companionship with each other when they dwell
in our minds.  Is there some warfare too in the heavenly house?
Yet the stars yonder and this earth we trouble, which are
celestial bodies, keep their places and seem to have no feuds
like ours.  You who are older than any here, who have feasted
more richly than any upon the wisdom of the world, can you effect
any reconcilement?  Here are men who have made themselves
formidable by the imagination and intellect they brought to bear
on the rights of the individual, or the constitution of society
and the state, who have many followers to whom they have spoken
in the language the commonalty understand, but what allures
themselves is something they cannot rationalize, something
frailer than the laughter of Helen before which kingdoms faded
away.  I begin to wonder whether all desperate wars in history
were not really fought to enable some fugitive beauty to endure
in human thought.  These magicians who have enchanted others, do
they weave about their own spirits an enchantment no more real
than the blossoms of illusion which flicker under the hands of an
eastern juggler?  I cannot believe as they believe.  I can divine
a nobler order in the world as the sculptor divined his statue in
the unshapen marble.  But it is this world suggests its own
perfection to me, not another world which would have us fashion
this in its own image.  I confess I am frightened to think how
lightly this earth, so solid to my imagination, weighs with these
comrades of mine, so that if the faintest breathing from another
nature falls on the scales, this earth with all its state,
cities, and history, tilts up as if the earth scale was freighted
with nothing."</p>

<p>"I think," answered the historian, "there is some
reconcilement of these ideas in my own being, for they have
entered it, and are in friendly unison;  but I could not now
formulate in any completeness a conception of cosmic being in
which such varied or contrary impulses are harmonized.  Nor do I
think, even with years of pondering over a choice of words
befitting our imagination, could words ever represent, to one who
has no direct vision or intuition of his own, what the words
signify.  I utter the word 'spirit' or 'beauty,' and in my own
being these words are symbols of emotion, moods, memories,
powers, intricate and intermingled, and so it is with almost
everything we give name to.  No single mental process, except
perhaps the mathematical, has ever been adequately translated
into an external symbolism. Speech is not like a mirror which
reflects fully the form before it;  but in speech, things which
by their nature are innumerable and endless, are indicated by
brief symbols.  For speech to convey true meanings there must be
clairaudience in the hearing. Those who have spoken here have
spoken intuitionally and without the laborious processes of
logic.  I also will say what I imagine in regard to these things
evoking in my mind images, and powers, and trusting to the
intuition with which you have apprehended each other to see what
is in my being also.  It may help us to a reconcilement if we
remember our infinitely varied human nature when analyzed is a
simple trinity of qualities.  Whatever we do, think, feel, or
imagine, whether about ourselves or the cosmos, we think in terms
of these three fundamentals, which are matter, energy, and
spirit.  We can surmise beyond these nothing except that
transcendental state where all raised above themselves exist in
the mystic unity we call Deity. In themselves they are as
mysterious as Deity, and when we ponder upon them they allure us
to regions where they become dark and blind with glory;  so that
the solid rock, melted and transfigured into its ultimate
essence, becomes primordial substance and is the garment of Deity
or mirror of its being, and, therefore, that ancient beauty which
is the archetype of all other transitory beauty. The powers which
shepherd the elements our science and intuition tell us spring
from one cosmic fountain.  This is true also of the powers we
ourselves use, for some who have passed through the Arcana where
the will has its throne found it rooted in the inflexible and
intellectual power, which sustains the universe.  Consciousness
also prolongs itself in meditation and ecstasy into a vaster
being, as Culain has said, and we do not know whether there is
any end to our being.  All that is substance in us aspires to the
ancestral beauty. All that is power in us desires to become
invincible.  All that is consciousness longs for fullness of
being.  These aspirations have molded philosophies and religions
as with Plato and Plotinus who conceived of Deity as beauty in
its very essence.  There were Indian sages who taught that the
will when concentrated had a mastery which extended from the
atomic to the infinite, and, in union with the divine will, gave
man almost an omnipotence of power.  Other religions again led
the soul to the fount of being and said to it, 'Thou art That.' I
think these desires express themselves no less in the symbolism
of politics, so that when one or another quality is predominant
in men or races their polity tends to create that world order in
which the predominant spiritual quality will have freest
play."</p>

<p>The historian was interrupted by Rian who said, 'But the
spiritual bases of four political theories have been discussed by
us, and your trinity of qualities omits to find an ancestry for
one of these. Is it Leroy's anarchic ideas that have no spiritual
foundation?"</p>

<p>To this Brehon replied, "If we can imagine this trinity
exalted above itself and existing in a unity, so also can we
imagine natures so balanced that they may be said to be more
complete symbols of the Self-existent or Solitary of the Heaven's
in whom all qualities inhere.  Such men tend to be self-sufficing
and to assert absolute kingship over their own being.  They exist
in increasing numbers; and the philosophy of anarchy which they
profess from being the most despised of political theories has in
three hundred years become one of the most powerful.  That has
come not only because the right or justice of the individual,
which appeals to the highly evolved soul, is asserted, but also,
I think, because the creation of great individuals is the intent
of Nature, which it has been said exists for the purposes of
soul.  The external law imposed by the greatest of states must
finally give way before the instinct for self-rule which alone is
consonant with the dignity and divinity of man. Though these are
traveling on the true path I do not think they will attain their
full stature until they comprehend the spiritual foundations on
which other political theories rest, and can build on them as do
the devotees of beauty or love or power."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch15"></a>CHAPTER XV.</h2>

<p class="first">
"I CAN understand Lavelle, Leroy, or Culain stirred by the
spirit, but the mass of men seem immovable as rock by that wind,"
said Rian. "I know when I see Lavelle walking down the street he
may be treading heavenly pavements, and that Culain sees souls
not bodies, but most men walk on concrete pavements and are
themselves but animated matter.  They nurse some dream of power
for their party or profit for themselves, and these desires
converge on the state, and so the world is made which we are
trying to unmake.  I can see when humanity is in a state of flux,
as it now is, how men with imagination spiritually quickened
could create new moulds into which the molten humanity may pour
itself.  But you suggest the spiritual powers at all times
influence the world order, whereas I think those so influenced
are few, and hardly in a thousand years is the multitude melted
into a spiritual mood.  If the divine nature is so interwoven
with our humanity it conceals itself marvelously from our
eyes."</p>

<p>"Our philosophy supposes the universe to be a spiritual
being," answered Brehon, "and if it be so the least creature
which becomes in it cannot escape infection from that which is
its own original. The most subtle analysis of consciousness
brings us to the apostle who said 'In Him we live and move and
have our being.'  We find that miraculous or transcendental
element involved in the swift creation which takes place in
dream, in the instant and marvelous harmonizing of consciousness
with the perpetually varying infinitude of nature, and minute
analysis leads us step by step to the realization that the least
motion of body or soul involves this transcendental element.  Nor
do we merely exist in this divine nature.  It exists also in us,
and I think men ever follow a spiritual light even when they seem
to be most turned away from it. When we analyze their desires,
even those which seem gross, we find what allures them is some
beauty or majesty mirrored in this from a loftier nature.  So the
lustful man is tormented by an inversion of the holy spirit or
creative fire.  The drunkard thirsts for fullness of being as the
god-intoxicated do.  Vanity in us is an echo of the consciousness
of beauty in the artificer of the cosmos, while hate is the dark
descendant of that wisdom which is perpetually regenerating the
universe.  Even those lost and hopeless who pursue their desires
to spiritual death are still seeking spiritual life.  They follow
a gleam mistakenly as we may imagine light-demented moths dashing
themselves at a moon on water. As in their private lusts men
still follow something in its essence universal, so too in their
imaginations about society are they allured by images and shadows
of their own hidden divinity."</p>

<p>"They are all god inspired then?" Rian interposed doubtfully.
"But how is it if all depend on the One we are here in conflict
with each other?"</p>

<p>"I think it might be truer to say of men that they are God
animated rather than God guided.  Yet in a sense it would be true
to say that of them also.  It is not necessary to infer because
there are contraries here there must be discord in the heavens.
We do not assume Nature is at strife with itself when there is
storm or earthquake, for we know the elements from atom to mass
are subject to a law from which none can escape, for it inheres
in the being of nature which maintains through its myriad
transformations music and balance in itself.  We can imagine our
own antagonisms also harmonized in the being in which they exist
and that too by a law from which there is no escape.  The law at
last makes us conscious of itself and we discover where it
constrains us and where there is freedom.  In this sense if we
equate Deity with law we may be said to be God guided.  We are
free of abyss or height, but if we descend to the depths the
spiritual powers desert us, as in the Chaldean myth of the
descent of Ishtar the goddess at every gate was bereft of some
symbol, and sceptre or diadem or robe or girdle or sandals were
taken from her until at last she entered the Underworld naked and
shorn of divinity.  That was a myth of the soul.  To us too as we
rise from the depths the spiritual powers return as to Ishtar at
the gate of every sphere was restored some of her regalia, until
entering through the, Ever-lasting gate she was once more crowned
and Queen of Heaven.  I do not think there can be finality for us
in politic, even in theory, because man is a still evolving being
not yet come to his fullness.  A change of mood, and what he held
to be precious yesterday is no longer so to him and, unregretful,
he lets it slip behind time.  Every high imagination of man is
the opening for him of some door to the divine world and there,
like Ishtar, he takes on some new attribute. He may have a vision
of beauty or feel the majesty of law, or the love which links the
Everliving together;  and as he sees or feels he imagines a world
order in harmony.  As his aspiration is so is his inspiration. He
becomes maker of beauty, revealer of law, avatar of power,
dispenser of justice, or seer of the heart. Whatever he has
apprehended of the divine nature he wishes that to prevail on
earth."</p>

<p>"We cannot live truly by mimicry of things either seen or
conceived," interposed Leroy.  It is life itself we ought to
exalt.  All this would reduce us to some kind of logical
existence in which the premise was not within us but without.  If
we are to live truly it must be by inward impulse."</p>

<p>"Why do we not walk out of this prison?" answered Brehon.
"Because there are walls all about us and a closed door.  If
there is immutable law the soul must take cognizance of it.  Yet,
if we consider truly, what is any vision of beauty but the
lighting up in us of some lordlier chamber of the soul than it
has hitherto inhabited?  The apprehension of law is but the
growth in ourselves of a profounder self-consciousness.  The
mighty is apprehended only by the mighty, and no dew of pity ever
seemed to fall from the sky save on those who themselves were
tender of heart.  The universe perpetually echoes back to us our
own attributes, and our furthest reaching out to understanding of
the nature which envelops us is our deepest comprehension of our
own being.  The universe exists for the soul not the soul for the
universe.  We cannot imagine a transformation of the Absolute
which could have meaning to itself, but for the spark wandering
in the immensity of that being we can imagine endless progress
from atomic to infinite life.  They are wise who study the
architecture of the cosmos, for the heaven and the heaven of
heavens were builded for us, and that majesty is but the mirror
in which we become conscious of our own magnificence. I do not
think as you do that recognition of the divine powers will take
sceptre or crown from the spirit of man, for all meditation ends
at last with the thinker, and he finds he is what he has himself
conceived.  The poet Blake said:</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">"It is impossible for thought,<br>

A greater than itself to know."</p>

<br>

<p>So too the Indian seers of old brought the soul by a thousand
pathways to the divine world, but never allowed it to fall down
or to worship divine being as beyond it, but whispered it in the
ecstasy of contemplation 'Thou art immortal. Thou art that."'</p>

<p>"But where are you now leading us?" cried Rian.  "It is a long
way from world polity to spiritual ultimates!"</p>

<p>"But that is where all these as they have revealed themselves
are tending.  All their politic is but a groping through the
symbols of earth to the Kingdom of Heaven.  They are all citizens
of that Kingdom and they drink in imagination from the same
fountain. Politic is a profane science only because it has not
yet discovered it has its roots in sacred or spiritual things and
must deal with them."</p>

<p>"Shall we find this Kingdom on earth?" asked Rian, "or must we
adventure into another world.  Must we take the Kingdom by
violence? I can understand the logic of fighting on earth but if
we are truly seeking for the Kingdom of Heaven can we gain it by
conquest?"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch16"></a>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>

<p class="first">
"If we accept the idea of a divine humanity brought to harmony
in some remote Golden Age, how can this better us today?" asked
Lavelle. "Must we not still fight for the good we are assured of?
I believe the ideals for which men are not ready to die soon
perish, for they have not drawn nourishment from what is immortal
in them.  If we do not throw life into the scale we are
outweighed by those who are ready for this sacrifice.  If we
become philosophical onlookers our nation, its culture and
ideals, perish, being undefended, and an unresisted materialism
takes its place.  The world becomes less lovely by what is
actually beautiful fading out of human life, not dying nobly, as
it might, overcome by a superior beauty.  The incarnate love came
not with peace but a sword.  It does not speak only with the Holy
Breath but has in its armory death and the strong weapons of the
other immortals.  We cannot put on the ideals of other peoples or
future ages as a garment.  It is better to remain unbroken to the
last, and I count it as noble to fight God's battles as to keep
His peace."</p>

<p>"I do not advocate philosophical indifference, for I believe
we can be fighters in the spirit and use immortal powers," the
old man answered the poet.  "In the divine economy nothing is
lost, for the spiritual nature exerts always an influence equal
to the intensity of its being.  You desire things which can only
be a possession of the spirit, but you yet act as if they were
material possessions which might be lost or stolen.  This may be
because you have not yet come to understand the laws of that
being in which all spiritual adventures take place.  I do not
think any one can lose what is his own save by descent from the
sphere where the things loved have their natural life.  I believe
spiritual ideals, except for the few who can maintain them
through all conflict, are lost if we defend them by material
means.  There are other ways by which right can find its
appropriate might."</p>

<p>"If we could be assured of that we would all be fighters in
the spirit!" cried Lavelle.   "But when did our nation win
anything save when I it stood armed and ready for the last
sacrifice?"</p>

<p>"You will find," answered the historian, "that every great
conflict has been followed by an era of materialism in which the
ideals for which the conflict ostensibly was waged were
submerged.  The gain if any was material.  The loss was
spiritual.  That was so inevitably because warfare implies a
descent of the soul to the plane where it is waged, and on that
plane it cannot act in fullness, or bring with it love, pity, or
forgiveness, or any of its diviner elements. There is another
reason why spiritual ideals may not be preserved by warfare, and
that is because it is its nature to evoke hatred.  Love and hate
have a magical transforming power.  They are the great soul
changers.  We grow through their exercise into the likeness of
what we contemplate.  By intensity of hatred nations create in
themselves the character they imagine in their enemies.  Hence it
comes that all passionate conflicts result in an interchange of
characteristics.  We might say with truth those who hate open a
door by which their enemies enter and make their own the secret
places of the heart."</p>

<p>"That is a terrible thought," said Lavelle.  "But is it more
than the expression of an ethical exaltation beyond human nature?
Is there not such a thing as a righteous anger which is proper to
us and not ignoble, nor implicating us in such a tragic
fate?"</p>

<p>"Can there be a beneficent union of what is good and evil in a
single mood?"</p>

<p>"If warfare indeed brings such on us such a lamentable
destiny, by what means may right find its appropriate might?  You
seemed to affirm that the spiritual powers by themselves win
victories for us.  How may we be made certain of this, for no one
will lay aside a powerful weapon until he is assured he may exert
another equal or a greater power?"</p>

<p>The historian made answer, "I came myself to such a certitude
through experience, being led to brood upon the nature of the
soul, when I was nearing completion of the history of our nation.
Though everything was done better than I had thought possible I
felt desolate in spirit and there came even an aversion to my
work. The light which had hitherto inspired me seemed now to lead
in a contrary direction.  For as one whose eyes from gazing on
Vivid orange turn and rest on a vacancy finds it pervaded by a
mist of blue, so my mind began to create in its emptiness the
contrary of all I had loved and the lure of national ideals begin
to be superseded by imaginations of a world state.  Where I might
have been led by this reaction I do not know but that I met and
afterwards became one of a company of men existing in many lands
who were unknown to the world and were bent on the conquest of
that vast life which is normally subconscious to us, so that they
might have more than speculative knowledge and be nearer to what
they truly were."</p>

<p>"Why was a quest so important pursued in secrecy?" asked
Lavelle.</p>

<p>"It was necessary lest there might be diverted to outward
argument and controversy the energies which were all needed for
the ascent to spirit, for this quest requires an heroic
enthusiasm, a courage rising again and again from defeat with
indestructible hope.  There was also a wisdom in it, for the mood
must be solemn when any would enter the cathedral of the
universe.  All enmities must be laid aside, as in the East the
worshippers lay their sandals outside the mosque.  A serenity of
feeling in which all diversities are harmonized has to be
attained, so that out of many a new being which can act with
power might be created.  In that psychic unity the faculties of
each one in the group gradually became the possession of all, a
possibility which Culain has already apprehended; and the will of
many in unison was powerful enough to transcend the bodily life
so that in meditation together consciousness rose like a tower
into heaven, and we were able to bring back some knowledge of the
higher law."</p>

<p>"Was there not peril in this meditation that the most powerful
character might impose his imagination upon the rest?" asked
Leroy. "An Indian fakir can impose his mental fantasy upon a
crowd so that they will see him swallowing  a poisonous snake
which exists only in his imagination and their vision.  And this
would be easier with groups such as you describe stilled to one
intent and porous to each others emanations."</p>

<p>"Of this, too, we were aware," said Brehon.  "For we were
guided by ancient wisdom, an experience garnered through
generations. It is true that the purification of nature,
obligatory if we were to succeed, makes the psyche sensitive and
translucent so that the feelings and imaginations of others
affect it swiftly, but the will at the same time is quickened to
more intense activity and made positive, so that to perceive or
receive the emanations of others is not to be overcome by them.
It is because I was in so close a psychic unity with others, and
that in a brotherhood which existed in many lands, that I was
made certain feeling and imagination radiate their influence to
the boundaries of the world soul as stars shed their light
through space.  These influences pour on us and through us and
illuminate or darken our lives.  I have come to believe even the
solitary or captive can by intensity of imagination and feeling
affect myriads so that he can act through many men and speak
through many voices.  The deeper the being the more powerful are
its radiations.  So far as the intellectual transcends the
physical so does the spiritual transcend the intellectual.  The
avatars of the spirit, the Christs and Buddhas, do more by single
gentleness, than conquerors with armies do, and build more
enduring kingdoms in the spirit of man.  The devotees of the
spirit, though few, give light to many.  With them the deed is
done when the thought is born, for if it is of the spirit it has
more than the swiftness of light, and a deeper penetrative power,
and it illuminates many hearts which have as yet no light of
their own.  If a kingdom is won by force, it must be sustained by
force, and, as Leroy has said, there is no real freedom.  But if
there is reliance on spiritual law, if we seek to be truly
ourselves, we draw naturally to seek for a like fullness of their
own being."</p>

<p>"Our civilizations have not been built up by the spiritual
imagination acting alone but by manifold labors of mind and
body," said Rian.  "I can imagine a house, but who could live in
the house of my dream unless the builders remake it in the
substance of this world?  If I poets or music makers never went
beyond the ecstasy of conception or brought down from heaven what
they had seen or heard would not our life be the poorer?  Would
we have any civilization at all?</p>

<p>"We do not lessen the power of the outer man by increasing the
power of the spiritual man, for the spirit cannot be quickened
without the strength of imagination and intellect being also
increased.  Nor can the life of man be spiritual only for he must
oscillate between Heaven and Earth until he has reached his own
centre and the immortal stills all in its Own being.  Until we
can act from our own centre our ascents to Heaven involve
reactions to outward life, but the soul returns to Earth,
wrapping its memories of Heaven about it like a cloth, and
shining as Moses going down from the Holy Mount.  Its deeds then,
are of a lordlier character and reflect the magnificence of its
imaginations.  As men come higher to the immortal their
civilizations will transcend ours as the Parthenon transcended
the huts of those who herded their flocks in a more ancient
Attica."</p>

<h2><a id="ch17"></a>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>

<p class="first">
"All distinctions of nationality seem to dissipate in a haze
in this transcendentalism," Lavelle protested.  "I mistrust the
philosophy which universalizes overmuch.  I admit a being which
is the fountain of all being, but what emerges from that fountain
is diversity of beauty in nature and humanity.  You spoke of
ancient Attica.  We find there as in Egypt, China, India, and
other lands, a character in the culture which does not appear
elsewhere, and this, I think, arose because the more sensitive
minds in every country came into contact with archetypal images
of a nature peculiar to these regions of the earth.  If for every
man on earth there is a divinity in the heavens who is his
ancestral self, should there not also be a varied and diviner
nature overshadowing this earth we know and influencing it as the
soul the body?  The ancients spoke of a many colored earth above
this and temples wherein the gods do truly dwell, and may not
these be the archetypes of our civilizations and the spiritual
basis of nationalities?  I must believe there are differences
above as below.  When we come to our own immortal it cannot be
that we cease to have individual character.  We cannot in the
perfection of the spirit be only perfect images of each other.  I
believe also in the heaven of which earth is a shadow there are
the divine originals of the lands we know.  Is not this what was
meant by the saying, 'In our Father's House are many mansions?'
As I listen to you these diversities of beauty and culture which
have enriched the world, which have, as I think, their root in a
deeper being and should be defended as part of the divine polity,
all seem to fade before some gigantic and undefined ideal.  Must
national distinctions be lost, and if so to what world order are
we tending?"</p>

<p>"I think," said the old man, "we are, evolving through all our
activities, through politics as through the arts and sciences to
realization of our full human stature, and in that realization
nothing that is rightly related to our humanity can be lost, no
spiritual influence from earth or sky.  If those influences you
speak are Heaven born the more humanity is transparent to spirit
the more will life be penetrated by them.  An oracle of the
Oversoul states the law 'Seek first the kingdom of Heaven and
everything else will be added to you.'  How by this quest may we
attain so rich a being?  Because as the psyche evolves, and we
become ourselves more fully, we awaken and attract all the powers
and elements which are akin to our expanding consciousness.  As
we absorb so we radiate influences equal to our intensity of
life.  We have not yet come to the limit of our faculties.  There
are uncharted regions of psychic nature, to which the perfected
faculties give us access and which we may aspire to rule.  The
ear has not attained that infinitude of hearing in which sounds
not only human but celestial are apprehended.  The heart has not
attained its infinity of feeling, nor the intellect its full
power of penetration, nor has the will yet found its conscious
root in the power which sustains the cosmos. With those who
recognize this incompleteness there can be neither certainty nor
finality in the relation of existing human groups to each other.
But to you who have gone beyond the bodily life and have
apprehended a spiritual nature I would point out a more excellent
way than conflict.  There is a justice, a law, which operates
beneath all physical appearances.  It is this which has brought
us together tonight.  It was spiritual affinity not the power of
empire which constrained us, though the law may use material
agencies to carry out its decrees.  The forces which shut us in
whether they know it or not are the servants of that law which
shapes outward circumstance in harmony with inward nature.
Because life is so molded for all of us there is no way of
bringing about the perfecting of human relations other than by
the transfiguration of the individual.  Everything we do
unaccompanied by an evolution of our consciousness to a higher
being is but futile readjustment of surfaces.  However we toil,
alter, or build we can give nothing more than is in ourselves,
and at the close of our ceaseless multiplication the total
remains the same.  I rely absolutely on this justice in the
universe.  I will not protest against anything which happens to
me because that would be to protest against my kingship over my
own destiny.  I am moved here and there by what I am.  If there
is pain to me in these happenings I shall try to discover where
there was misdirection of will which brought it about.  Those who
begin to live consciously in the spirit must be guided by an
ethic based on the nature of the ancestral self or heavenly man.
In that being, as Culain has said, all human life is reflected,
so that none can be our enemies, and we can overcome only by the
fierce and tender breath of love, if love be the heavenly name of
that which yearns in us to be intimate with the innermost of all
life.  Once that spiritual awakening has begun for any the old
life should be over, and they should no longer be concerned in
the politics of time, and should leave the life of conflict and
passion and fit themselves for the politics of eternity.  Men
cling because of old habit to formulae they have really outgrown
and which have lost their lure.  Below the old ideals vaster
desires spring up, to win mastery over the elements, to chase the
divinities.  For a time they try to achieve the new ends by the
old methods.  But it is in vain, for nothing can be won save by
the full devotion of the heart.  If we do not enlarge the
political ideals with the expanding spiritual consciousness, if
we shut any out of our heart by making emotional or intellectual
boundaries to human brotherhood, if any race or class are
excluded, we pervert the spiritual energies whose natural flow is
from each to all;  and these energies, diverted from their
natural goal, turn backwards and downward, and poison the very
deeps of life, and they there generate spiritual pestilences,
hates, frenzies, madnesses, and the sinister ecstasy making for
destruction which is the divine power turned to infernal uses.
Through ignorance of spiritual law idealists who take to warfare
are perpetually defeated, for they do not realize the dark shadow
which follows all conflict and which must follow this present
conflict by the perversion of spiritual forces.  These perverted
energies endanger human life, not merely because they lead men to
conflict with each other, but because they bring about a warfare
of nature on humanity.  We have supposed of the Universe it is a
spiritual being, and the elements have intellectual guidance. The
possibility of direct control of these nature forces through a
growing comprehension of their relation to our own intellectual
being has been referred to here. These powers await our
sovereignty.  There are legions of allies for us in air, in
earth, in sea, ready to do our bidding when we come to our full
stature and can command them with wisdom and power. But it is an
error, I think, to suppose of them that they are not moved by us
now, for there is perpetual communication between the elements in
our being and their counterparts in nature.  If we poison or
infect them by our frenzies and passions, the distraught powers
bring about cataclysms, earthquakes, and subsidences, and the
evil humanity is shaken off the back of nature.  The old poet who
said, 'There is not a breathing of the common wind that will
forget thee' was wiser than he knew.  We ray our influence not
only on each other but on Nature, which more slowly, but
inevitably, operates her own justice.  Who can say there was no
conscious intent in Nature when Atlantis sunk under water;  who
can say our mad humanity is not making inevitable a similar doom
for this continent?  I say that for those whose spiritual nature
has awakened the old life should be over and they should be the
fighters in the spirit and use immortal powers.  Nor need there
be fear lest by this re-direction of energy strength should be
lost to any cause which has a basis in the spirit.  In the ascent
to Heaven, as Socrates said, we create a multitude of high and
noble thoughts, our own nature expanding until at last we attain
a science which is equal to a beauty so vast.  Our science tells
us that the impact of a heavenly body on the sun makes it to glow
with a fiercer heat. Even so when the soul ascends to the
spiritual sun a more blinding radiance is emitted from that
being.  It is the benediction on Earth for yielding to Heaven the
things which are Heaven's, and this benediction falls on the path
by which the soul had mounted upwards, and it illuminates and
strengthens what it touches, the power as it flows outward
following the chain of thought and mood by which the soul had
ascended.  Indeed the soul is perpetually receiving this
benediction, for, as I said, every imagination of man is the
opening or the closing of a door to the divine world, and in
whatever way he truly approaches it it meets him.  From that
being in which he lives and moves a fight enters through every
transparency, however momentary, of his nature, and it extends
itself through all that is akin to it.  That which enters us is
the sap of the eternal sacred tree whose roots are in the heavens
and whose branches grow downward to earth.  Whatever way we
approach it it answers us.  It entered into Lavelle as a boy upon
his mountain, and was with Culain in his dark streets, and with
Heyt in his state laboratories and thought of a demiurgic power,
and with Leroy in his passion for freedom.  It endows one with
power and bestows abundantly of life on another, and to all who
make sacrifice it responds by a law which is so wonderful that if
it was understood it would be the delight of the heart.  I do not
think of it as law. I call it rather Own-Being.  The yearning of
our innermost life is for that sweet and stern and infallible
justice, which brings us to Heaven or Hell as our desires rise or
fall in the scale of being. We are the children of Deity, and
with us consciousness extends from the dim flicker in heart or
brain up to the Heaven of Heavens. We live in many worlds, but
the links are lost between the divided portions of our manifold
being so that we forget in waking what we were in dream, or what
majesty was ours in the regions beyond dream. While we are on
this earth matter conditions energy and dominates life.  In the
mid region which we also inhabit energy or desire is the master
and mind and matter its slaves.  But in that heaven world in
which man attains his full stature the soul is master and
whenever it imagines or wills the energies and elements act in
obedience to it.  Those who would mould life in accord with
divine nature must remember until their faculties are perfected
they look at it through the stained glass of the personal and be
watchful lest they limit in imagination that which is boundless.
They must equal themselves to its vastness, for does not the
Scripture say, 'Be ye perfect even as the Father in Heaven is
also perfect.'  Those who seek for beauty will never master its
magic unless they also have power, and those who seek for power
will find that the mighty surrenders itself fully only to that
which is most gentle;  and we shall be repulsed perpetually until
we have made perfect in ourselves those elements out of which
both we and the universe are fashioned and which, made pure, will
relate us to the vaster life of the cosmos.  Therefore we ought
to regard none who differ from us as enemies but to contemplate
them rather with yearning as those who possess some power or
vision from which we are I shut out but which we ought to share.
If we seek for the fullness of being there can be no decay of
what is beautiful in the world, for what is right always
exercises its appropriate might.  If we do not realize this it is
because we do not know the sum total of our character and what
uncomprehended elements in ourselves and others defeat what is
noblest.  But if we seek for the highest in ourselves and have
this reliance on the law to justify and sustain us we shall see
the Kingdom.  Yes, we shall rule in the Kingdom."</p>

<p>"It seems easy," said Rian, "to reshape the world simply by
going on thinking and imagining and leaving to others the
execution of what we devise.  I do this in my own art, but the
philosophy seems to have a kind of incompleteness when applied to
the shaping of human destiny."</p>

<p>"It is not easy," answered the old man.  "To cross that red
mid-region between heaven and earth is to undertake labors
greater and more painful than these fabled of Hercules.  In that
red mid-region the martyrdom of the passionate soul, its
crucifixion in the spirit, takes place until all that is gross is
etherealized and it yields itself finally in absolute resignation
to the ancestral being.  It is not easy to stay the will against
the desire of the world or to draw ourselves from the attraction
of that magnet, as Leroy knows. But if we persist a time comes
when the spiritual outweighs the bodily with us, and it will be
so with all men, and finally they will at first with pain, but in
the end with rejoicing, journey in multitude to the Land of
Promise.  They will do so because man is spiritual at the root
and cannot escape from himself for ever and the promise of the
spirit to the spark wandering in the immensity of its own being
was 'I will not leave thee nor forsake thee!"</p>

<h2><a id="ch18"></a>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>

<p class="first">
LEROY, a very sincere, but rarely a solemn being for long,
grew restless towards the close of Brehon's commentary on the
symposium, and broke a rather strained silence with one of his
whimsies.</p>

<p>"I once had a vision of a funeral service in the other world
before I was born, where I was committed to the grave of this
body, and the angelic being who presided murmured something about
his hopes for a joyful resurrection of their brother who was now
buried in matter.  But I felt there was little real confidence in
his voice, and when he departed I heard a dialogue between a
skeptical spirit who said he did not believe any came back from
Earth to Heaven. He had met none.  The other spirit, more
credulous, thought there was good evidence that certain beings
had risen out of the grave of the body, but the skeptic said if
they had they were merely cases of premature burial.  I have felt
while I listened to you all I was prematurely buried myself and
was still under that ancient domination of Heaven from which I
hoped I had escaped."</p>

<p>"Oh, you need not be afraid," cried Rian. "Your egomania is so
concentrated it will persist when all the rest of us have gone
back into the primeval silences, and you will be a solitary of
the universe wandering about in quest for something to revolt
against."</p>

<p>"Well!" said Leroy, "let us discover who are truly human.
What do you think of all this?"  He turned to Rudd, and that
prisoner, long baffled in his efforts to understand things remote
from his mentality, and at last irritated, broke out with much
profanity that he never heard so much folly.  One world was
enough for him; one small country all he could think about.  The
empire found half a world too big to govern.  It could only hold
together by exterminating any who did not submit to it.  If he
had to comprehend three worlds before he could act in this he
would go mad.  He hated being bullied in the name of a law he had
no share in making.  He hated being instructed how to live in the
name of science which was unintelligible, and most of all he
hated being told in the name of God how to think.  And after
this, and much else, he walked indignantly to the other end, of
the room.</p>

<p>"I have much sympathy with Rudd," said Rian. "He expresses
emotions we have all shared, and which, I fancy, had as much to
do with bringing us here as these fine imaginations of the
Oversoul.  I cannot think of him as influenced by beauty or any
of the other divinities.  I think he belongs to your household,
Leroy."</p>

<p>"I accept him."</p>

<p>"How did you come to share in this, Mara?" Rian asked another
prisoner.</p>

<p>"Oh, because I wanted to be with Lavelle and you," was the
answer.</p>

<p>"I am afraid that is the mob instinct.  It is a sub-species of
Culain's mood.  You lose your identity in that of others.  What
drew you to fight, Owen?"</p>

<p>"I wanted excitement, I am afraid.  I never felt really alive
until I was body and soul in our conspiracy."</p>

<p>"It was the same mood which drew Leroy out of Paradise
millenniums ago.  What was your inspiration, Gavin?"</p>

<p>"I think the thought of death for our country was sweet to
me."</p>

<p>"Ah, your emotions must seem lovely to you before you are
stirred by them.  You comrade dimly with Lavelle.  And you,
Morane?"</p>

<p>"I was in a rage with life I think."</p>

<p>"That rage with you I know rose out of pity.  You were born
under the same star as Culain.  And you, Brugha?"</p>

<p>"I heard rebellion talked since I was a child.  It was so with
my family for generations.  They were in every insurrection.  It
is a tradition with us."</p>

<p>"That is ancestor worship.  I could not place you in any of
our categories unless I knew the mood of the first ancestor.  He
may have been another Leroy.  The others are asleep and I am not
going to waken them for the purpose of this symposium.  It comes
to an end.  I wonder if I had heard all this a year ago would it
have made any difference.  It can make little difference
now."</p>

<p>A silence came over the room.  Rian, who sat on the floor,
watched Lavelle, who was in one of the windows.  He saw after a
while the dark head begin to nod, the lips to move and murmur.
Being himself tired he wondered at the inexhaustible energy of
mind which could so pursue beauty, for he knew by the Movement of
head and lips the poet had returned to his art.  Lavelle began
writing on a scrap of paper in the dim light, and when he had
finished Rian came and sat beside him.</p>

<p>"Your imagination is a river running for ever," he said.
"What is it you write?  I hope it is not a swan-song."</p>

<p>"I was completing the last poem in a Book of Voyages wherein
I, like the poets of our country before me, tell of journeyings
to the Land of Immortal Youth."</p>

<p>"We may soon be travelers there ourselves if all that legend
relates of the other worlds be true.  I myself only wanted to
make this world lovely.  I never tried to scale the heavens to
look on another beauty.  But I would like to hear the adventures
of your voyager."</p>

<p>"It is a dream about one who died in an old insurrection of
our people hundreds of years ago.  I had thought it finished but
I was moved by what was said here tonight to add some
interpretation to the dream."</p>

<p>Lavelle's lips moved soundlessly for a little as if he was
trying to find if memory ran easily, and then, in a voice low at
first but which soon became rich and vibrant, he chanted the
story he had imagined of Michael, a voyager to the Heaven World.
Leroy, Rian, and the old historian alone listened, for the others
had composed themselves to sleep, which they did soon, being
weary, and Culain sat with his head bowed on his arms on the
table, and none knew whether he was in a sleep or was
meditating.</p>

<h2><a id="ch19"></a>CHAPTER XIX.</h2>

<p class="verse">A wind blew by from icy hills,<br>

Shook with cold breath the daffodils,<br>

And shivered as with silver mist<br>

The lake's pale leaden amethyst.<br>

It pinched the barely budded trees<br>

And rent the twilight tapestries:<br>

Left for one hallowed instant bare<br>

A single star in lonely air<br>

O'er stony lanes the bitter wind<br>

Had swept of all their human kind.</p>

<p class="verse">Ere that the fisher folk were all<br>

Snug under thatch and sheltering wall,<br>

Breathing the cabin's air of gold,<br>

Safe from blue storm and nipping cold.<br>

And, clustered round the hearth within,<br>

With fiery hands and burnished chin,<br>

They sat and listened to old tales,<br>

Or legends of gigantic gales.<br>

Some told of phantom craft they knew<br>

That sailed with a flame-colored crew,<br>

And came up strangely through the wind<br>

Havens invisible to find<br>

By those rare cities poets sung,<br>

Cresting the Islands of the Young.</p>

<p class="verse">How do the heights above our head,<br>

The depths below the water spread,<br>

Waken the spirit in such wise<br>

That to the deep the deep replies,<br>

And in far spaces of the soul<br>

The oceans stir, the heavens roll?</p>

<p class="verse">Michael must leave the morrow morn<br>

The countryside where he was born;<br>

And all day long had Michael clung<br>

Unto the kin he lived among.<br>

But at some talk of sea and sky<br>

He heard an older mother cry.<br>

The cabin's golden air grew dim:<br>

The cabin's walls drew down on him:<br>

The cabin's rafters hid from sight<br>

The cloudy rooftree of the night.<br>

And Michael could not leave behind<br>

His kinsmen of the wave and wind<br>

Without farewell. The way he took<br>

Ran like a twisted, shining brook,<br>

Speckled with stones and ruts and rills,<br>

'Mid a low valley of dark hills,<br>

And trees so tempest-bowed that they<br>

Seemed to seek double root in clay.</p>

<p class="verse">At last the dropping valley turned:<br>

A sky of murky citron burned.<br>

Above through flying purples seen<br>

Lay pools of heavenly blue and green.<br>

From the sea rim unto the caves,<br>

Rolled on a mammoth herd of waves.<br>

While all about the rocky bay<br>

Leaped up gray forests of wild spray,<br>

Glooming above the ledges brown<br>

Ere their pale drift came drenching down.</p>

<p class="verse">Things delicate and dewy clung<br>

To Michael's cheeks. The salt air stung.<br>

From crag to crag did Michael leap<br>

Until he overhung the deep;<br>

Saw in vast caves the waters roam,<br>

The ceaseless ecstasy of foam,<br>

Whirlpools of opal, lace of light<br>

Strewn over quivering malachite,<br>

Ice-tinted mounds of water rise<br>

Glinting as with a million eyes,<br>

Reel in and out of light and shade,<br>

Show depths of ivory or jade,<br>

New broidery every instant wear,<br>

Spun by the magic weaver, Air.</p>

<p class="verse">Then Michael's gaze was turned from these<br>

Unto the far, rejoicing seas,<br>

Whose twilight legions onward rolled,<br>

A turbulence of dusky gold,<br>

A dim magnificence of froth,<br>

A thunder tone which was not wrath,<br>

But such a speech as earth might cry<br>

Unto far kinsmen in the sky.<br>

The spray was tossed aloft in air:<br>

A bird was flying here and there.<br>

Foam, bird, and twilight to the boy<br>

Seemed to be but a single joy.<br>

He closed his eyes that he might be<br>

Alone with all that ecstasy.</p>

<p class="verse">What was it unto Michael gave<br>

This joy, the life of earth and wave?<br>

Or did his candle shine so bright<br>

But by its own and natural light?<br>

Ah, who can answer for what powers<br>

Are with us in the secret hours!<br>

Though wind and wave cried out no less,<br>

Entranced into forgetfulness,<br>

He heard no more the water's din;<br>

A golden ocean rocked within.<br>

A boat of bronze and crystal wrought<br>

And steered by the enchanter, Thought,<br>

Was flying with him fast and far<br>

To isles that glimmered, each a star<br>

Hung low upon the distant rim,<br>

And then the vision rushed on him.</p>

<p class="verse">The palaces of light were there,<br>

With towers that faded up in air,<br>

With amethyst and silver spires.<br>

And casements lit with precious fires,<br>

And mythic forms with wings outspread,<br>

And faces from which light was shed.<br>

High upon gleaming pillars set,<br>

On turret and on parapet,<br>

The bells were chiming all around<br>

And the sweet air was drunk with sound.</p>

<p class="verse">Too swift did Michael pass to see<br>

Ildathich's mystic chivalry<br>

Graved on the walls, its queens and kings<br>

Girt round with eyes and stars and wings<br>

The magic boat with Michael drew<br>

To some deep being that he knew,<br>

Some mystery that to the wise<br>

Is clouded o'er by Paradise.<br>

Some will that would not let him stay<br>

Hurried the boat away, away.<br>

At last its fiery wings were still,<br>

Folded beneath some heavenly hill.</p>

<p class="verse">But was that Michael light as air<br>

Was traveling up the mighty stair?<br>

Or had impetuous desire<br>

Woven for him that form of fire,<br>

Which with no less a light did shine<br>

Than those with countenance divine,<br>

Who thronged the gateway as he came,<br>

Faces of rapture and of flame,<br>

The glowing, deep, unwavering eyes<br>

Of those eternity makes wise.<br>

And lofty things to him were said<br>

As to one risen from the dead.<br>

What, there beyond the gate befell<br>

Michael could never after tell.<br>

Imagination still would fail<br>

Some height too infinite to scale,<br>

Some being too profound to scan,<br>

Some time too limitless to span.<br>

Yet when he lifted up his eyes<br>

That foam was gray against the skies,<br>

That same wild bird was on the wing,<br>

That twilight wave was glimmering.<br>

And twilight wave and foam and bird<br>

Had hardly in his vision stirred<br>

Since he had closed his eyes to be<br>

Of that majestic company.</p>

<p class="verse">And can a second then suffice<br>

To hurry us to Paradise?<br>

What seemed so endlessly sublime<br>

Shrink to a particle of time?<br>

Why was the call on Michael made?<br>

What charge was on his spirit laid?<br>

And could the way for him be sure<br>

Made by excess of light obscure?<br>

However fiery is the dream,<br>

How faint in life the echoing gleam!<br>

And faint was all that happed that day<br>

As home he went his dreamy way.</p>

<p class="verse">And now has Michael, for his share<br>

Of life, the city's dingy air,<br>

By the black reek of chimneys smudged<br>

O'er the dark warehouse where he drudged,<br>

Where for dull life men pay in toll<br>

Toil and the shining of the soul.<br>

Within his attic he would fret<br>

Like a wild creature in a net,<br>

And on the darkness he would make<br>

The jewel of a little lake,<br>

A bloom of fairy blue amid<br>

The bronze and purple heather hid;<br>

Make battlemented cliffs grow red<br>

Where the last rose of day was shed,<br>

Be later in rich darkness seen<br>

Against a sky of glowing green.<br>

Or he would climb where quiet fills<br>

With dream the shepherd on the hills,<br>

Where he could see as from high land<br>

The golden sickle of the sand,<br>

Curving around the bay to where<br>

The granite cliffs were worn by air,<br>

And watch the wind and waves at play,<br>

The heavenly gleam of falling spray,<br>

The sunlit surges foam below<br>

In wrinklings as of liquid snow.<br>

And he could breathe the airs that blew<br>

From worlds invisible he knew:<br>

How far away now from the boy!<br>

How unassailable their joy!</p>
<br>

<p>"Oh, Lavelle!  Lavelle!" cried Rian, I know those hills and
little lakes.  Shall we ever see them again?"</p>
<br>

<p class="verse">So Michael would recall each place<br>

As lovers a remembered face.<br>

But, though the tender may not tire,<br>

Memory is but a fading fire.<br>

And Michael's might have sunken low,<br>

Changed to gray ash its colored glow,<br>

Did not upon his hearing fall<br>

The mountain speech of Donegal,<br>

And that he swiftly turned to greet<br>

The tongue whose accent was so sweet;<br>

And found one of that eager kind,<br>

The army of the Gaelic mind,<br>

Still holding through the Iron Age<br>

The spiritual heritage,<br>

The history from the gods that ran<br>

Through many a circle down to man<br>

And soon with them had Michael read<br>

The story of the famous dead,<br>

From him who with his single sword<br>

Stayed a great army at the ford,<br>

Down to the vagrant poets, those<br>

Who gave their hearts to the Dark Rose;<br>

And of the wanderers who set sail<br>

And found a lordlier Innisfail,<br>

And saw a sun that never set<br>

And all their hearts' desires were met.</p>

<p class="verse">How may the past, if it be dead,<br>

Its light within the living shed?<br>

Or does the Ever-living hold<br>

Earth's memories from the Age of Gold?<br>

And are our dreams, ardors, and fires<br>

But ancient unfulfilled desires?<br>

And do they shine within our clay,<br>

And do they urge us on their way?<br>

As Michael read the Gaelic scroll<br>

It seemed the story of the soul;<br>

And those who wrought, lest there should<br>

From earth the legend of the Gael,<br>

Seemed warriors of Eternal Mind,<br>

Still holding in a world grown blind.<br>

From which belief and hope had gone,<br>

The lovely magic of its dawn.</p>

<p class="verse">Thrice on the wheel of time recurred<br>

The season of the risen Lord<br>

Since Michael left his home behind<br>

And faced the chilly Easter wind,<br>

And saw the twilight waters gleam<br>

And dreamed an unremembered dream.<br>

Was it because the Easter time<br>

With mystic nature was in chime<br>

That memory was roused from sleep,<br>

Or was deep calling unto deep?<br>

The lord in man had risen here,<br>

From the dark sepulchre of fear,<br>

Was willful, laughing, undismayed,<br>

Though on a fragile barricade<br>

The bullet rang, the death star broke,<br>

The street waved dizzily in smoke,<br>

And there the fierce and lovely breath<br>

Of flame in the gray mist was death.</p>

<p class="verse">Yet Michael felt within him rise<br>

The rapture that is sacrifice.<br>

What miracle was wrought on him,<br>

So that each leaden-freighted limb<br>

Seemed lit with fire, seemed light as air?<br>

How came upon him dying there,<br>

Amid the city's burning piles,<br>

The vision of the mystic isles?<br>

For underneath and through the smoke<br>

A glint of golden waters broke:<br>

And floated on that phantom tide,<br>

With fiery wings expanded wide,<br>

A bark of bronze and crystal wrought<br>

And steered by the enchanter, Thought.<br>

And noble faces glowed above,<br>

Faces of ecstasy and love,<br>

And eyes whose shining calm and pure<br>

Was in eternity secure,<br>

And lofty forms of burnished air<br>

Stood on the deck by Michael there.<br>

And spirit upon spirit gazed,<br>

And one to Michael's lips upraised<br>

A cup filled from that Holy Well<br>

On which the Nuts of Wisdom fell.<br>

And as he drank there reeled away<br>

Vision of earth and night and day,<br>

And he was far away from these,<br>

Afloat upon the heavenly seas.</p>
<br>

<p>"Here the voyage as I had written it ended," said the poet.
"But I have added what follows in interpretation, for indeed I
was moved by what was said in this room."</p>

<p>"Are you at this hour forgetting your own ideals?" asked
Rian.</p>

<p>"You shall judge," answered Lavelle, continuing his
narrative.</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">I do not know if such a band<br>

Came from the Many-Colored Land:<br>

Or whether in our being we<br>

Make such a magic phantasy<br>

Of images which draw us hence<br>

Unto our own magnificence.<br>

Yet many a one a tryst has kept<br>

With the immortal while he slept,<br>

Woke unremembering, went his way.<br>

Life seemed the same from day to day,<br>

Till the predestined hour came,<br>

A hidden will leaped up in flame,<br>

And through its deed the risen soul<br>

Strode on self-conquering to the goal.</p>

<p class="verse">This was the dream of one who died<br>

For country, said his countryside.<br>

We choose this cause or that, but still<br>

The Everlasting works its will.<br>

The slayer and the slain may be<br>

Knit in a secret harmony.<br>

What does the spirit urge us to?<br>

Some sacrifice that may undo<br>

The bonds that hold us to the clay,<br>

And limit life to this cold day?<br>

Some for a gentle dream will die:<br>

Some for an empire's majesty:<br>

Some for a loftier humankind,<br>

Some to be free as cloud or wind,<br>

Will leave their valley, climb their slope.<br>

Whate'er the deed, whate'er the hope,<br>

Through all the varied battle cries<br>

A Shepherd with a single voice<br>

Still draws us nigh the Gates of Gold<br>

That lead unto the heavenly fold.</p>

<p class="verse">So it may be that Michael died<br>

For some far other countryside<br>

Than that gray island he had known.<br>

Yet on his dream of it was thrown<br>

Some light from that consuming Fire<br>

Which is the end of all desire.<br>

If men adore It as the power,<br>

Empires and cities, tower on tower,<br>

Are built in worship by the way,<br>

High Babylon or Nineveh.<br>

Seek It as love and there may be<br>

A Golden Age and Arcady.<br>

All shadows are they of one thing<br>

To which all life is journeying.</p>

<br>

<p>When he had made an end Rian said, "Where, I wonder, in this
universe of many dimensions shall we really go after death?  Is
there one heavenly house for us all, or will we live in ourselves
as so many suppose, our genius playing a fantasy, on our memories
and desires?  I remember one mystic telling me that we all had a
genie like Aladdin, and it would build marvelous palaces for us
and exalt our dreams into unimaginable light.  Such solitary
magnificence would please Leroy more than me.  I am a sociable
person, but I am now too drowsy for more speculation."  Leroy, as
tireless in mind as Lavelle, would have made a commentary on all
that had been said, but he saw Lavelle was sinking into reverie
and was not inclined for further speech, so he made a pretence of
imitating Rian who was trying to sleep in a chair.  But no sleep
during the night came to that restless soul.</p>

<h2><a id="ch20"></a>CHAPTER XX.</h2>

<p class="first">
FROM the recess of the window Lavelle gazed into the night
enveloping the monstrous fabric of the city.  In an abeyance of
will brought about by weariness he became oppressed by the
melancholy which so often arises through contemplation of an
external vastness in which humanity becomes dwarfed, and what
seemed lofty in the heart shrivels to littleness by the
measurement of the eye.  Beyond the murky city shining seas were
rolling by shadowy mountains, and over them heavens which lost
themselves in their own depths, rumoring their own infinitudes,
fainting and faltering in their speech, for light, though it be
swiftest of all things, ere it has found a final resting-place or
hamlet in the gloom, the worlds it spake of have long ceased to
be.  The stare of the night seemed pitiless and immutable, and he
did not then remember that those heavens had always echoed his
mood and were gay or solemn as he was exultant or mournful,
reflecting as a glass from hour to hour the transformations in
his own spirit. The poetic nature has all childhood's excess of
emotion, and in an anguish such as the heart of childhood might
hold he thought of the Golden Age passed away from the world and
the terrible and material powers ruling in the Iron Age.  Through
a night of time endless to his imagination he foresaw the
martyrdom of those who like himself had nourished longing for the
light and an earth made gay by a laughter which was worse than
sobbing.  Out of this meditation arose an immense pity for life;
and because the sadness was spiritual and was not for himself,
was indeed self-forgetful, it was marvelously rolled away and a
deep serenity took its place.  He felt the universe was sweet at
heart, and that same majesty which had played with him as a boy
among the hills was with him and he knew it would be with him to
the end, and by it all dreams would be fulfilled.  He murmured to
himself the words of promise "Long lost hearts burn in the oil of
the lamp of the King."  Like a spell the utterance quickened a
memory which had kept his life austere for many years, and a
young beauty which had been made dust glowed before him as if it
had never perished.  She seemed to live in a luminous and blessed
air, and was running to him along hills strangely like the hills
his boyhood knew, and face and eyes were more ecstatic than life.
"Oh, Magic! Magic!" he whispered, calling her by the sweet name
his fancy had bestowed on so vivid and lovely a girlhood.  Then
form and face faded, swallowed up in the Ever-living out of which
they came, and her last look seemed to echo back the promise of
the words, "long lost hearts burn in the oil of the lamp of the
King."  And then his yearning brought him nigh to the fountain in
which that and all other beauty had been born;  and he knew that
all that was cast up by it was lovely, and if rust or decay came
over the spirit they were burned away as it fell back into the
fountain where it received once more the primal blessings of
youth, ecstasy, and beauty.  In that hour innumerable images of
life, hopes, and dreams hitherto uncomprehended, causes to which
he had closed his heart, men from whom he had been remote in
soul, all came nigh him with some revelation of their inmost
being in which they reflected the ancient beauty.  In each was
some ray of Eternal Mind.  The Eternal Mind going forth knew
itself in them, and they returning knew themselves in it.  The
All-seeing and All-knowing had not withheld life from any, and
while they were sustained by It and It had not condemned them, it
was not for man to take life away.  He remembered the words of
the old man, "We should cast none out of the heart."  And
brooding on himself he saw how he had closed the doors to many by
devotion, to one form of beauty only, and he realized that what
was cast out of the heart must force entry by pain, for life
would be denied entry to none of its realms.  All this was
revealed to him when thought had ceased, and he was carried
beyond himself, and his spirit seemed to be bathed by some
shoreless ocean of sweet unterminable being.  Never was he so
remote from the vision of life, and never more intimate with
being.  Everything was understood.  Everything was loved.
Everything was forgiven.  He knew after that exaltation he could
never be the same again.  Never could he be fierce or passionate.
And his wisdom must be to retain this serenity, and he forbore to
think of the conflict that had brought him there, and he stilled
every earthly memory lest he might be cast out from the
spirit.</p>

<p>Through the night he sat with closed eyes made radiant within
and sustained by that profundity of being men worship as the
Father. At last his eyes opened.  A dawn was beginning to lighten
in the East.  Gold began to mix with the blue, and the armada
which had been floating invisibly in the high air was fired by
light from a sun not yet over the horizon.  He saw the old
historian seated beside him.  His eyes were fixed on Lavelle, and
he whispered to the poet, "You have come nigh to the Kingdom.
You have seen the Kingdom."  Because of that recognition Lavelle
felt the old man more the intimate of his spirit than even that
beauty he had so long remembered and loved, but which had never
shared with him the revelation of the Eternal.</p>

<p>As the dawn kindled, the tumult in the city, which had been
stilled for a while, broke out again furiously.  There were
shouts and concussions and reverberations.  The prisoners in the
great room woke from uneasy slumbers.  The conflict came closer
to the great building in which they were confined and the rattle
was deafening. Leroy, alert as ever, was first to understand what
was taking place. "Our comrades are winning in the city," he
cried.  "They are encircling the arsenal."</p>

<p>He had hardly spoken when the door opened and an officer
appeared, who said, "We may have to evacuate this building and
fight our way through the city.  We cannot take prisoners with
us.  I have to tell you if we evacuate we shall blow up the
arsenal."  The prisoners were silent for a moment, but Leroy,
always generous, said, "This prisoner," pointing to Heyt, "is not
of us.  He is here by error.  He is for empire and is not worthy
to die with us."</p>

<p>He told the officer who Heyt was, and the officer, startled by
the name, sent for another who recognized the president of the
Air Federation.  Lavelle would have intervened on behalf of the
old historian.  But Brehon placed his hand gently on the arm of
the poet and he knew it was forbidden.  The Imperialist, moved by
what he had heard and understanding these men were different from
all he had imagined of them, hesitated for a moment as if he
would have said or urged something.  Then he shook his head as if
he realized how impossible it now was to effect anything, and he
left them without a word and went out to make the world in his
own image.</p>

<h2><a id="app1"></a>THE AUTHOR...</h2>

<p class="first">AE, pseudonym of George William Russell, (born April 10, 1867, Lurgan, County Armagh, Ireland; died July 17, 1935, Bournemouth, Hampshire, England), poet, artist, and mystic, a leading figure in the Irish literary renaissance of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Russell took his pseudonym from a proofreader's query about his earlier pseudonym, "AEon."</p>

<p>After attending the Metropolitan School of Art, Dublin, where he met the poet William Butler Yeats, Russell became an accounts clerk in a drapery store but left in 1897 to organize agricultural cooperatives. Eventually he became editor of the periodicals <em>The Irish Homestead</em> (1904-23) and <em>The Irish Statesman</em> (1923-30). In 1894 he published the first of many books of verse, <em>Homeward: Songs by the Way</em>. His first volume of <em>Collected Poems</em> appeared in 1913 and a second in 1926. He maintained a lifelong interest in theosophy, the origins of religion, and mystical experience. <em>The Candle of Vision</em> (1918) is the best guide to his religious beliefs.</p>
