  <h2><a name="pre"
     id="pre">PREFACE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THIS work has grown from small disconnected chapters into a
  narrative which covers in a way the whole history of the Spiritualistic
  movement. This genesis needs some little explanation. I had written certain
  studies with no particular ulterior object save to gain myself, and to pass
  on to others, a clear view of what seemed to me to be important episodes in
  the modern spiritual development of the human race. These included the
  chapters on Swedenborg, on Irving, on A. J. Davis, on the Hydesville
  incident, on the history of the Fox sisters, on the Eddys and on the life of
  D.D. Home. These were all done before it was suggested to my mind that I had
  already gone some distance in doing a fuller history of the Spiritualistic
  movement than had hitherto seen the light&mdash;a history which would have
  the advantage of being written from the inside and with intimate personal
  knowledge of those factors which are characteristic of this modern
  development.</p>

  <p>It is indeed curious that this movement, which many of us regard as the
  most important in the history of the world since the Christ episode, has
  never had a historian from those who were within it, and who had large
  personal experience of its development. Mr. Frank Podmore brought together a
  large number of the facts, and, by ignoring those which did not suit his
  purpose, endeavoured to suggest the worthlessness of most of the rest,
  especially the physical phenomena, which in his view were mainly the result
  of fraud. There is a history of Spiritualism by Mr. McCabe which turns
  everything to fraud, and which is itself a misnomer, since the public would
  buy a book with such a title under the impression that it was a serious
  record instead of a travesty. There is also a history by J. Arthur Hill which
  is written from a strictly psychic research point of view, and is far behind
  the real provable facts. Then we have "Modern American Spiritualism: A Twenty
  Years' Record," and "Nineteenth Century Miracles," by that great woman and
  splendid propagandist, Mrs. Emma Hardinge Britten, but these deal only with
  phases, though they are exceedingly valuable. Finally&mdash;and best of all
  &mdash;there is "Man's Survival After Death," by the Rev. Charles L.
  Tweedale; but this is rather a very fine connected exposition of the truth of
  the cult than a deliberate consecutive history. There are general histories
  of mysticism, like those of Ennemoser and Howitt, but there is no clean-cut,
  comprehensive story of the successive developments of this world-wide
  movement. Just before going to press a book has appeared by Campbell-Holms
  which is a very useful compendium of psychic facts, as its title, "The Facts
  of Psychic Science and Philosophy," implies, but here again it cannot claim
  to be a connected history.</p>

  <p>It was clear that such a work needed a great deal of research&mdash;far
  more than I in my crowded life could devote to it. It is true that my time
  was in any case dedicated to it, but the literature is vast, and there were
  many aspects of the movement which claimed my attention. Under these
  circumstances I claimed and obtained the loyal assistance of Mr. W. Leslie
  Curnow, whose knowledge of the subject and whose industry have proved to be
  invaluable. He has dug assiduously into that vast quarry; he has separated
  out the ore from the rubbish, and in every way he has been of the greatest
  assistance. I had originally expected no more than raw material, but he has
  occasionally given me the finished article, of which I have gladly availed
  myself, altering it only to the extent of getting my own personal point of
  view. I cannot admit too fully the loyal assistance which he has given me,
  and if I have not conjoined his name with my own upon the title-page it is
  for reasons which he understands and in which he acquiesces.</p>

    <p class="caption">Emanuel Swedenborg.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p class="first">IT is impossible to give any date for the early appearances
  of external intelligent power of a higher or lower type impinging upon the
  affairs of men. Spiritualists are in the habit of taking March 31, 1848, as
  the beginning of all psychic things, because their own movement dates from
  that day. There has, however, been no time in the recorded history of the
  world when we do not find traces of preternatural interference and a tardy
  recognition of them from humanity. The only difference between these episodes
  and the modern movement is that the former might be described as a case of
  stray wanderers from some further sphere, while the latter bears the sign of
  a purposeful and organized invasion. But as an invasion might well be
  preceded by the appearance of pioneers who search out the land, so the spirit
  influx of recent years was heralded by a number of incidents which might well
  be traced to the Middle Ages or beyond them. Some term must be fixed for a
  commencement of the narrative, and perhaps no better one can be found than
  the story of the great Swedish seer, Emanuel Swedenborg, who has some claim
  to be the father of our new knowledge of supernal matters.</p>

  <p>When the first rays of the rising sun of spiritual knowledge fell upon the
  earth they illuminated the greatest and highest human mind before they shed
  their light on lesser men. That mountain peak of mentality was this great
  religious reformer and clairvoyant medium, as little understood by his own
  followers as ever the Christ has been.</p>

  <p>In order fully to understand Swedenborg one would need to have a
  Swedenborg brain, and that is not met with once in a century. And yet by our
  power of comparison and our experience of facts of which Swedenborg knew
  nothing, we can realize some part of his life more clearly than he could
  himself. The object of this study is not to treat the man as a whole, but to
  endeavour to place him in the general scheme of psychic unfolding treated in
  this work, from which his own Church in its narrowness would withhold
  him.</p>

  <p>Swedenborg was a contradiction in some ways to our psychic
  generalizations, for it has been the habit to say that great intellect stands
  in the way of personal psychic experience. The clean slate is certainly most
  apt for the writing of a message. Swedenborg's mind was no clean slate, but
  was criss-crossed with every kind of exact learning which mankind is capable
  of acquiring. Never was there such a concentration of information. He was
  primarily a great mining engineer and authority on metallurgy. He was a
  military engineer who helped to turn the fortunes of one of the many
  campaigns of Charles XII of Sweden. He was a great authority upon astronomy
  and physics, the author of learned works upon the tides and the determination
  of latitude. He was a zoologist and an anatomist. He was a financier and
  political economist who anticipated the conclusions of Adam Smith. Finally,
  he was a profound Biblical student who had sucked in theology with his
  mother's milk, and lived in the stern Evangelical atmosphere of a Lutheran
  pastor during the most impressionable years of his life. His psychic
  development, which occurred when he was fifty-five, in no way interfered with
  his mental activity, and several of his scientific pamphlets were published
  after that date.</p>

  <p>With such a mind it is natural enough that he should be struck by the
  evidence for extra-mundane powers which comes in the way of every thoughtful
  man, but what is not natural is that he should himself be the medium for such
  powers. There is a sense in which his mentality was actually detrimental and
  vitiated his results, and there was another in which it was to the highest
  degree useful. To illustrate this one has to consider the two categories into
  which his work may be divided.</p>

  <p>The first is the theological. This seems to most people outside the chosen
  flock a useless and perilous side of his work. On the one hand he accepts the
  Bible as being in a very particular sense the work of God. Upon the other he
  contends that its true meaning is entirely different from its obvious
  meaning, and that it is he, and only he, who, by the help of angels, is able
  to give the true meaning. Such a claim is intolerable. The infallibility of
  the Pope would be a trifle compared with the infallibility of Swedenborg if
  such a position were admitted. The Pope is at least only infallible when
  giving his verdict on points of doctrine ex cathedra with his cardinals
  around him. Swedenborg's infallibility would be universal and un restricted.
  Nor do his explanations in the least commend themselves to one's reason.
  When, in order to get at the true sense of a God-given message, one has to
  suppose that a horse signifies intellectual truth, an ass signifies
  scientific truth, a flame signifies improvement, and so on and on through
  countless symbols, we seem to be in a realm of make-believe which can only be
  compared with the ciphers which some ingenious critics have detected in the
  plays of Shakespeare. Not thus does God send His truth into the world. If
  such a view were accepted the Swedenborgian creed could only be the mother of
  a thousand heresies, and we should find ourselves back again amid the
  hair-splittings and the syllogisms of the mediaeval schoolmen. All great and
  true things are simple and intelligible. Swedenborg's theology is neither
  simple nor intelligible, and that is its condemnation.</p>

  <p>When, however, we get behind his tiresome exegesis of the Scriptures,
  where everything means something different from what it obviously means, and
  when we get at some of the general results of his teaching, they are not
  inharmonious with liberal modern thought or with the teaching which has been
  received from the Other Side since spiritual communication became open. Thus
  the general proposition that this world is a laboratory of souls, a
  forcing-ground where the material refines out the spiritual, is not to be
  disputed. He rejects the Trinity in its ordinary sense, but rebuilds it in
  some extraordinary sense which would be equally objectionable to a Unitarian.
  He admits that every system has its divine purpose and that virtue is not
  confined to Christianity. He agrees with the Spiritualist teaching in seeking
  the true meaning of Christ's life in its power as an example, and he rejects
  atonement and original sin. He sees the root of all evil in selfishness, yet
  he admits that a healthy egoism, as Hegel called it, is essential. In sexual
  matters his theories are liberal to the verge of laxity. A Church he
  considered an absolute necessity, as if no individual could arrange his own
  dealings with his Creator. Altogether, it is such a jumble of ideas, poured
  forth at such length in so many great Latin volumes, and expressed in so
  obscure a style, that every independent interpreter of it would be liable to
  found a new religion of his own. Not in that direction does the worth of
  Swedenborg lie.</p>

  <p>That worth is really to be found in his psychic powers and in his psychic
  information which would have been just as valuable had no word of theology
  ever come from his pen. It is these powers and that information to which we
  will now turn.</p>

  <p>Even as a lad young Swedenborg had visionary moments, but the extremely
  practical and energetic manhood which followed submerged that more delicate
  side of his nature. It came occasionally to the surface, however, all through
  his life, and several instances have been put on record which show that he
  possessed those powers which are usually called "travelling clairvoyance,"
  where the soul appears to leave the body, to acquire information at a
  distance, and to return with news of what is occurring elsewhere. It is a not
  uncommon attribute of mediums, and can be matched by a thousand examples
  among Spiritualistic sensitives, but it is rare in people of intellect, and
  rare also when accompanied by an apparently normal state of the body while
  the phenomenon is proceeding. Thus, in the oft-quoted example of Gothenburg,
  where the seer observed and reported on a fire in Stockholm, 300 miles away,
  with perfect accuracy, he was at a dinner-party with six teen guests, who
  made valuable witnesses. The story was investigated by no less a person than
  the philosopher Kant, who was a contemporary.</p>

  <p>These occasional incidents were, however, merely the signs of latent
  powers which came to full fruition quite suddenly in London in April of the
  year 1744 It may be remarked that though the seer was of a good Swedish
  family and was elevated to the Swedish nobility, it was none the less in
  London that his chief books were published, that his illumination was begun
  and finally that he died and was buried. From the day of his first vision he
  continued until his death, twenty-seven years later, to be in constant touch
  with the other world. "The same night the world of spirits, hell and heaven,
  were convincingly opened to me, where I found many persons of my acquaintance
  of all conditions. Thereafter the Lord daily opened the eyes of my spirit to
  see in perfect wakefulness what was going on in the other world, and to
  converse, broad awake, with angels and spirits."</p>

  <p>In his first vision Swedenborg speaks of "a kind of vapour steaming from
  the pores of my body. It was a most visible watery vapour and fell downwards
  to the ground upon the carpet." This is a close description of that ectoplasm
  which we have found to be the basis of all physical phenomena. The substance
  has also been called "ideoplasm," because it takes on in an instant any shape
  with which it is impressed by the spirit. In this case it changed, according
  to his account, into vermin, which was said to be a sign from his Guardians
  that they disapproved of his diet, and was accompanied by a clairaudient
  warning that he must be more careful in that respect.</p>

  <p>What can the world make of such a narrative? They may say that the man was
  mad, but his life in the years which followed showed no sign of mental
  weakness. Or they might say that he lied. But he was a man who was famed for
  his punctilious veracity. His friend Cuno, a banker of Amsterdam, said of
  him, "When he gazed upon me with his smiling blue eyes it was as if truth
  itself was speaking from them." Was he then self-deluded and honestly
  mistaken? We have to face the fact that in the main the spiritual
  observations which he made have been confirmed and extended since his time by
  innumerable psychic observers. The true verdict is that he was the first and
  in many ways the greatest of the whole line of mediums, that he was subject
  to the errors as well as to the privileges which mediumship brings, that only
  by the study of mediumship can his powers be really understood, and that in
  endeavouring to separate him from Spiritualism his New Church has shown a
  complete misapprehension of his gifts, and of their true place in the general
  scheme of Nature. As a great pioneer of the Spiritual movement his position
  is both intelligible and glorious. As an isolated figure with
  incomprehensible powers, there is no place for him in any broad comprehensive
  scheme of religious thought.</p>

  <p>It is interesting to note that he considered his powers to be intimately
  connected with a system of respiration. Air and ether being all around us, it
  is as if some men could breathe more ether and less air and so attain a more
  etheric state. This, no doubt, is a crude and clumsy way of putting it, but
  some such idea runs through the work of many schools of psychic thought.
  Laurence Oliphant, who had no obvious connexion with Swedenborg, wrote his
  book "Sympneumata" in order to explain it. The Indian system of Yoga depends
  upon the same idea. But anyone who has seen an ordinary medium go into trance
  is aware of the peculiar hissing intakes with which the process begins and
  the deep expirations with which it ends. A fruitful field of study lies there
  for the Science of the future. Here, as in other psychic matters, caution is
  needed. The author has known several cases where tragic results have followed
  upon an ignorant use of deep-breathing psychic exercises. Spiritual, like
  electrical power, has its allotted use, but needs some knowledge and caution
  in handling.</p>

  <p>Swedenborg sums up the matter by saying that when he communed with spirits
  he would for an hour at a time hardly draw a breath, "taking in only enough
  air to serve as a supply to his thoughts." Apart from this peculiarity of
  respiration, Swedenborg was normal during his visions, though he naturally
  preferred to be secluded at such times. He seems to have been privileged to
  examine the other world through several of its spheres, and though his
  theological habit of mind may have tinctured his descriptions, on the other
  hand the vast range of his material knowledge gave him unusual powers of
  observation and comparison. Let us see what were the main facts which he
  brought back from his numerous journeys, and how far they coincide with those
  which have been obtained since his day by psychic methods.</p>

  <p>He found, then, that the other world, to which we all go after death,
  consisted of a number of different spheres representing various shades of
  luminosity and happiness, each of us going to that for which our spiritual
  condition has fitted us. We are judged in automatic fashion, like going to
  like by some spiritual law, and the result being determined by the total
  result of our life, so that absolution or a death-bed repentance can be of
  little avail. He found in these spheres that the scenery and conditions of
  this world were closely reproduced, and so also was the general framework of
  society. He found houses in which families lived, temples in which they
  worshipped, halls in which they assembled for social purposes, palaces in
  which rulers might dwell.</p>

  <p>Death was made easy by the presence of celestial beings who helped the
  new-comer into his fresh existence. Such new-comers had an immediate period
  of complete rest. They regained consciousness in a few days of our time.</p>

  <p>There were both angels and devils, but they were not of another order to
  ourselves. They were all human beings who had lived on earth and who were
  either undeveloped souls, as devils, or highly developed souls, as
  angels.</p>

  <p>We did not change in any way at death. Man lost nothing by death, but was
  still a man in all respects, though more perfect than when in the body. He
  took with him not only his powers but also his acquired modes of thought, his
  beliefs and his prejudices.</p>

  <p>All children were received equally, whether baptized or not. They grew up
  in the other world. Young women mothered them until the real mother came
  across.</p>

  <p>There was no eternal punishment. Those who were in the hells could work
  their way out if they had the impulse. Those in the heavens were also in no
  permanent place, but were working their way to something higher.</p>

  <p>There was marriage in the form of spiritual union in the next world. It
  takes a man and a woman to make a complete human unit. Swedenborg, it may be
  remarked, was never married in life.</p>

  <p>There was no detail too small for his observation in the spirit spheres.
  He speaks of the architecture, the artisans' work, the flowers and fruits,
  the scribes, the embroidery, the art, the music, the literature, the science,
  the schools, the museums, the colleges, the libraries and the sports. It may
  all shock conventional minds, though why harps, crowns and thrones should be
  tolerated and other less material things denied, it is hard to see.</p>

  <p>Those who left this world old, decrepit, diseased, or deformed, renewed
  their youth, and gradually assumed their full vigour. Married couples
  continued together if their feelings towards each other were close and
  sympathetic. If not, the marriage was dissolved. "Two real lovers are not
  separated by the death of one, since the spirit of the deceased dwells with
  the spirit of the survivor, and this even to the death of the latter, when
  they again meet and are reunited, and love each other more tenderly than
  before."</p>

  <p>Such are some gleanings out of the immense store of information which God
  sent to the world through Swedenborg. Again and again they have been repeated
  by the mouths and the pens of our own Spiritualistic illuminates. The world
  has so far disregarded it, and clung to outworn and senseless conceptions.
  Gradually the new knowledge is making its way, however, and when it has been
  entirely accepted the true greatness of the mission of Swedenborg will be
  recognized, while his Biblical exegesis will be forgotten.</p>

  <p>The New Church, which was formed in order to sustain the teaching of the
  Swedish master, has allowed itself to become a backwater instead of keeping
  its rightful place as the original source of psychic knowledge. When the
  Spiritualistic movement broke out in 1848, and when men like Andrew Jackson
  Davis supported it with philosophic writings and psychic powers which can
  hardly be distinguished from those of Swedenborg, the New Church would have
  been well advised to hail this development as being on the lines indicated by
  their leader. Instead of doing so, they have preferred, for some reason which
  is difficult to understand, to exaggerate every point of difference and
  ignore every point of resemblance, until the two bodies have drifted into a
  position of hostility. In point of fact, every Spiritualist should honour
  Swedenborg, and his bust should be in every Spiritualist temple, as being the
  first and greatest of modern mediums. On the other hand, the New Church
  should sink any small differences and join heartily in the new movement,
  contributing their churches and organization to the common cause.</p>

  <p>It is difficult on examining Swedenborg's life to discover what are the
  causes which make his present-day followers look askance at other psychic
  bodies. What he did then is what they do now. Speaking of Polhem's death the
  seer says: "He died on Monday and spoke with me on Thursday. I was invited to
  the funeral. He saw the hearse and saw them let down the coffin into the
  grave. He conversed with me as it was going on, asking me why they had buried
  him when he was alive. When the priest pronounced that he would rise again at
  the Day of judgment he asked why this was, when he had risen already. He
  wondered that such a belief could obtain, considering that he was even now
  alive."</p>

  <p>This is entirely in accord with the experience of a present-day medium. If
  Swedenborg was within his rights, then the medium is so also.</p>

  <p>Again: "Brahe was beheaded at 10 in the morning and spoke to me at 10 that
  night. He was with me almost without interruption for several days."</p>

  <p>Such instances show that Swedenborg had no more scruples about converse
  with the dead than the Christ had when He spoke on the mountain with Moses
  and Elias.</p>

  <p>Swedenborg has laid down his own view very clearly, but in considering it
  one has to remember the time in which he lived and his want of experience of
  the trend and object of the new revelation. This view was that God, for good
  and wise purposes, had separated the world of spirits from ours and that
  communication was not granted except for cogent reasons&mdash;among which
  mere curiosity should not be counted. Every earnest student of the psychic
  would agree with it, and every earnest Spiritualist is averse from turning
  the most solemn thing upon earth into a sort of pastime. As to having a
  cogent reason, our main reason is that in such an age of materialism as
  Swedenborg can never have imagined, we are endeavouring to prove the
  existence and supremacy of spirit in so objective a way that it will meet and
  beat the materialists on their own ground. It would be hard to imagine any
  reason more cogent than this, and therefore we have every right to claim that
  if Swedenborg were now living he would have been a leader in our modern
  psychic movement.</p>

  <p>Some of his followers, notably Dr. Garth Wilkinson, have put forward
  another objection thus: "The danger of man in speaking with spirits is that
  we are all in association with our likes, and being full of evil these
  similar spirits, could we face them, would but confirm us in our own state of
  views."</p>

  <p>To this we can only reply that though it is specious it is proved by
  experience to be false. Man is not naturally bad. The average human being is
  good. The mere act of spiritual communication in its solemnity brings out the
  religious side. Therefore as a rule it is not the evil but the good influence
  which is encountered, as the beautiful and moral records of séances will
  show. The author can testify that in nearly forty years of psychic work,
  during which he has attended innumerable séances in many lands, he has never
  on any single occasion heard an obscene word or any message which could
  offend the ears of the most delicate female. Other veteran Spiritualists
  bring the same testimony. Therefore, while it is undoubtedly true that evil
  spirits are attracted to an evil circle, in actual practice it is a very rare
  thing for anyone to be incommoded thereby. When such spirits come the proper
  procedure is not to repulse them, but rather to reason gently with them and
  so endeavour to make them realize their own condition and what they should do
  for self-improvement. This has occurred many times within the author's
  personal experience and with the happiest results.</p>

  <p>Some little personal account of Swedenborg may fitly end this brief review
  of his doctrines, which is primarily intended to indicate his position in the
  general scheme. He must have been a most frugal, practical, hard-working and
  energetic young man, and a most lovable old one. Life seems to have mellowed
  him into a very gentle and venerable creature. He was placid, serene, and
  ever ready for conversation which did not take a psychic turn unless his
  companions so desired. The material of such conversations was always
  remarkable, but he was afflicted with a stammer which hindered his
  enunciation. In person he was tall and spare, with a spiritual face, blue
  eyes, a wig to his shoulders, dark clothing, knee-breeches, buckles, and a
  cane.</p>

  <p>Swedenborg claimed that a heavy cloud was formed round the earth by the
  psychic grossness of humanity, and that from time to time there was a
  judgment and a clearing up, even as the thunderstorm clears the material
  atmosphere. He saw that the world, even in his day, was drifting into a
  dangerous position owing to the unreason of the Churches on the one side and
  the reaction towards absolute want of religion which was caused by it. Modern
  psychic authorities, notably Vale Owen, have spoken of this ever-
  accumulating cloud, and there is a very general feeling that the necessary
  cleansing process will not be long postponed.</p>

  <p>A notice of Swedenborg from the Spiritualistic standpoint may be best
  concluded by an extract from his own diary. He says: "All confirmations in
  matters pertaining to theology are, as it were, glued fast into the brains,
  and can with difficulty be removed, and while they remain, genuine truths can
  find no place." He was a very great seer, a great pioneer of psychic
  knowledge, and his weakness lay in those very words which he has written.</p>

  <p>The general reader who desires to go further will find Swedenborg's most
  characteristic teachings in his "Heaven and Hell," "The New Jerusalem," and
  "Arcana Coelestia." His life has been admirably done by Garth Wilkinson,
  Trobridge, and Brayley Hodgetts, the present president of the English
  Swedenborg Society. In spite of all his theological symbolism, his name must
  live eternally as the first of all modern men who has given a description of
  the process of death, and of the world beyond, which is not founded upon the
  vague ecstatic and impossible visions of the old Churches, but which actually
  corresponds with the descriptions which we ourselves obtain from those who
  endeavour to convey back to us some clear idea of their new existence.</p>

    <p class="caption">Edward Irving (1792-1834)</p>
  </div><br>

  <p class="first">THE story of Edward Irving and his experience of spiritual
  manifestations in the years from 1830 to 1833 are of great interest to the
  psychic student, and help to bridge the gap between Swedenborg on one side
  and Andrew Jackson Davis on the other. The facts are as follows:</p>

  <p>Edward Irving was of that hard-working poorer-class Scottish stock which
  has produced so many great men. Of the same stock and at the same time and
  district came Thomas Carlyle. Irving was born in Annan in the year 1792.
  After a hard, studious youth, he developed into a very singular man. In
  person he was a giant and a Hercules in strength, his splendid physique being
  only marred by a bad outward cast of one eye&mdash;a defect which, like
  Byron's lame foot, seemed in some sort to present an analogy to the extremes
  in his character. His mind, which was virile, broad and courageous, was
  warped by early training in the narrow school of the Scottish Church, where
  the hard, crude views of the old Covenanters&mdash;an impossible
  Protestantism which represented a reaction against an impossible Catholicism
  &mdash;still poisoned the human soul. His mental position was strangely
  contradictory, for while he had inherited this cramped theology he had failed
  to inherit much which is the very birthright of the poorer Scot. He was
  opposed to all that was liberal, and even such obvious measures of justice as
  the Reform Bill of 1832 found in him a determined opponent.</p>

  <p>This strange, eccentric, and formidable man had his proper environment in
  the 17th century, when his prototypes were holding moorland meetings in Gallo
  way and avoiding, or possibly even attacking with the arms of the flesh, the
  dragoons of Claverhouse. But, live when he might, he was bound to write his
  nacre in some fashion on the annals of his time. We read of his strenuous
  youth in Scotland, of his rivalry with his friend Carlyle in the affections
  of the clever and vivacious Jane Welsh, of his enormous walks and feats of
  strength, of his short career as a rather violent school-teacher at
  Kirkcaldy, of his marriage to the daughter of a minister in that town, and
  finally of his becoming curate or assistant to the great Dr. Chalmers, who
  was, at that time, the most famous clergyman in Scotland, and whose
  administration of his parish in Glasgow is one of the outstanding chapters in
  the history of the Scottish Church. In this capacity he gained that
  man-to-man acquaintance with the poorer classes which is the best and most
  practical of all preparations for the work of life. Without it, indeed, no
  man is complete.</p>

  <p>There was at that time a small Scottish church in Hatton Garden, off
  Holborn, in London, which had lost its pastor and was in a poor position,
  both spiritually and financially. The vacancy was offered to Dr. Chalmers's
  assistant, and after some heart-searchings was accepted by him. Here his
  sonorous eloquence and his thoroughgoing delivery of the Gospel message began
  to attract attention, and suddenly the strange Scottish giant became the
  fashion. The humble street was blocked by carriages on a Sunday morning, and
  some of the most distinguished men and women in London scrambled for a share
  of the very scanty accommodation. There is evidence that this extreme
  popularity did not last, and possibly the preacher's habit of expounding a
  text for an hour and a half was too much for the English weakling, however
  acceptable north of the Tweed. Finally a move was made to a larger church in
  Regent Square which could hold two thousand people, and there were sufficient
  stalwarts to fill this in decent fashion, though the preacher had ceased to
  excite the interest of his earlier days. Apart from his oratory, Irving seems
  to have been a conscientious and hardworking pastor, striving assiduously for
  the temporal needs of the more humble of his flock, and ever ready at all
  hours of the day or night to follow the call of duty.</p>

  <p>Soon, however, there came a rift between him and the authorities of his
  Church. The matter in dispute made a very fine basis for a theological
  quarrel of the type which has done more harm in the world than the smallpox.
  The question was whether the Christ had in Him the possibility of sin, or
  whether the Divine portion of His being was a complete and absolute bar to
  physical temptations. The assessors contended that the association of such
  ideas as sin and Christ was a blasphemy. The obdurate clergyman, however,
  replied with some show of reason that unless the Christ had the capacity for
  sin, and successfully resisted it, His earthly lot was not the same as ours,
  and His virtues deserved less admiration. The matter was argued out in London
  with immense seriousness and at intolerable length, with the result that the
  presbytery declared its unanimous disapproval of the pastor's views. As,
  however, his congregation in turn expressed their unqualified approval, he
  was able to disregard the censure of his official brethren.</p>

  <p>But a greater stumbling-block lay ahead, and Irving's encounter with it
  has made his name live as all names live which associate themselves with real
  spiritual issues. It should first be understood that Irving was deeply
  interested in Biblical prophecy, especially the vague and terrible images of
  St. John, and the strangely methodical forecasts of Daniel. He brooded much
  over the years and the days which were fixed as the allotted time before the
  days of wrath should precede the Second Coming of the Lord. There were others
  at that time&mdash;1830 and onwards&mdash;who were deeply immersed in the
  same sombre speculations. Among these was a wealthy banker named Drummond,
  who had a large country house at Albury, near Guildford. At this house these
  Biblical students used to assemble from time to time, discussing and
  comparing their views with such thoroughness that it was not unusual for
  their sittings to extend over a week, each day being fully taken up from
  breakfast to supper. This band was called the "Albury Prophets." Excited by
  the political portents which led up to the Reform Bill, they all considered
  that the foundations of the deep had been loosened. It is hard to imagine
  what their reaction would have been had they lived to witness the Great War.
  As it was, they were convinced that the end of all things was at hand, and
  they looked out eagerly for signs and portents, twisting the vague and
  sinister words of the prophets into all manner of fantastic
  interpretations.</p>

  <p>Finally, above the monotonous horizon of human happenings there did
  actually appear a strange manifestation. There had been a legend that the
  spiritual gifts of earlier days would reassert themselves before the end, and
  here apparently was the forgotten gift of tongues coming back into the
  experience of mankind. It had begun in 1830 on the western side of Scotland,
  where the names of the sensitives, Campbell and MacDonald, spoke of that
  Celtic blood which has always been more alive to spiritual influences than
  the heavier Teutonic strain. The Albury Prophets were much exercised in their
  minds, and an emissary was sent from Mr. Irving's church to investigate and
  report. He found that the matter was very real. The people were of good
  repute, one of them, indeed, a woman whose character could best be described
  as saintly. The strange tongues in which they both talked broke out at
  intervals, and the manifestation was accompanied by healing miracles and
  other signs of power. Clearly it was no fraud or pretence, but a real influx
  of some strange force which carried one back to apostolic times. The faithful
  waited eagerly for further developments.</p>

  <p>These were not long in coming, and they broke out in Irving's own church.
  It was in July, 1831, that it was rumoured that certain members of the
  congregation had been seized in this strange way in their own homes, and
  discreet exhibitions were held in the vestry and other secluded places. The
  pastor and his advisers were much puzzled as to whether a more public
  demonstration should be tolerated. The matter settled itself, however, after
  the fashion of affairs of the spirit, and in October of the same year the
  prosaic Church of Scotland service was suddenly interrupted by the strange
  outcry of the possessed. It came so suddenly and with such vehemence, both at
  the morning and afternoon service, that a panic set in in the church, and had
  it not been for their giant pastor thundering out, "Oh, Lord, still the
  tumult of the people!" a tragedy might have followed. There was also a good
  deal of hissing and uproar from those who were conservative in their tastes.
  Altogether the sensation was a considerable one, and the newspapers of the
  day were filled with it, though their comments were far from respectful or
  favourable.</p>

  <p>The sounds came from both women and men, and consisted in the first
  instance of unintelligible noises which were either mere gibberish, or some
  entirely unknown language. "Sudden, doleful, and unintelligible sounds," says
  one witness. "There was a force and fulness of sound," said another
  description, "of which the delicate female organs would seem incapable." "It
  burst forth with an astounding and terrible crash," says a third. Many,
  however, were greatly impressed by these sounds, and among them was Irving
  himself. "There is a power in the voice to thrill the heart and overawe the
  spirit after a manner which I have never felt. There is a march and majesty
  and sustained grandeur of which I have never heard the like. It is likest to
  one of the simplest and most ancient chants in the cathedral service in so
  much that I have been led to think that these chants, which can be traced as
  high as Ambrose, are recollections of the inspired utterances of the
  primitive Church."</p>

  <p>Soon, moreover, intelligible English words were added to the strange
  outbursts. These usually consisted of ejaculations and prayers, with no
  obvious sign of any supernormal character save that they broke out at
  unseasonable hours and independently of the will of the speaker. In some
  cases, however, these powers developed until the gifted one was able, while
  under the influence, to give long harangues, to lay down the law in most
  dogmatic fashion over points of doctrine, and to issue reproofs which
  occasionally were turned even in the direction of the longsuffering
  pastor.</p>

  <p>There may have been&mdash;in fact, there probably was&mdash;a true psychic
  origin to these phenomena, but they had developed in a soil of narrow bigoted
  theology, which was bound to bring them to ruin. Even Swedenborg's religious
  system was too narrow to receive the full undistorted gifts of the spirit, so
  one can imagine what they became when contracted within the cramped limits of
  a Scottish church, where every truth must be shorn or twisted until it
  corresponds with some fantastic text. The new good wine will not go into the
  old narrow bottles. Had there been a fuller revelation, then doubtless other
  messages would have been received in other fashions which would have
  presented the matter in its just proportions, and checked one spiritual gift
  by others. But there was no development save towards chaos. Some of the
  teaching received could not be reconciled with orthodoxy, and was therefore
  obviously of the devil. Some of the sensitives condemned others as heretics.
  Voice was raised against voice. Worst of all, some of the chief speakers
  became convinced themselves that their own speeches were diabolical. Their
  chief reason seems to have been that they did not accord with their own
  spiritual convictions, which would seem to some of us rather an indication
  that they were angelic. They entered also upon the slippery path of prophecy,
  and were abashed when their own prophecies did not materialize.</p>

  <p>Some of the statements which came through these sensitives, and which
  shocked their religious sensibilities, might seem to deserve serious
  consideration by a more enlightened generation. Thus one of these Bible-
  worshippers is recorded as saying, concerning the Bible Society, "That it was
  the curse going through the land, quenching the Spirit of God, by the letter
  of the Word of God." Right or wrong, such an utterance would seem to be
  independent of him who uttered it, and it is in close accord with many of the
  spiritual teachings which we receive to-day. So long as the letter is
  regarded as sacred, just so long can anything, even pure materialism, be
  proved from that volume.</p>

  <p>One of the chief mouthpieces of the spirit was a certain Robert Baxter
  &mdash;not to be confused with the Baxter who some thirty years later was
  associated with certain remarkable prophecies. This Robert Baxter seems to
  have been a solid, earnest, prosaic citizen who viewed the Scriptures much as
  a lawyer views a legal document, with an exact valuation of every phrase
  &mdash;especially of such phrases as fitted into his own hereditary scheme of
  religion. He was an honest man with a restless conscience, which continually
  worried him over the smaller details, while leaving him quite unperturbed as
  to the broad platform upon which his beliefs were constructed. This man was
  powerfully affected by the influx of spirit&mdash;to use his own phrase, "his
  mouth was opened in power." According to him, January 14, 1832, was the
  beginning of those mystical 1,260 days which were to precede the Second
  Coming and the end of the world. Such a prediction must have been
  particularly sympathetic to Irving with his millennial dreams. But long
  before the days were fulfilled Irving was in his grave, and Baxter had
  forsworn those voices which had, in this instance at least, deceived him.</p>

  <p>Baxter has written a pamphlet with the portentous title, "Narrative of
  Facts, Characterising the Supernatural Manifestations, in Members of Mr.
  Irving's Congregation, and other Individuals, in England and Scotland, and
  formerly in the Writer Himself." Spiritual truth could no more come through
  such a mind than white light could come through a prism, and yet in this
  account he has to admit the occurrence of many things which seem clearly
  preternatural, mixed up with much that is questionable, and some things which
  are demonstrably false. The object of the pamphlet is mainly to forswear his
  evil and invisible guides, so that he may return to the safe if flattish
  bosom of the Scottish Church. It is noticeable, however, that a second member
  of Irving's congregation wrote an answering pamphlet with an even longer
  title, which showed that Baxter was right so long as he was prompted by the
  spirit, and wrong in his Satanic inferences. This pamphlet is interesting as
  containing letters from various people who possessed the gift of tongues,
  showing that they were earnest-minded folk who were incapable of any
  conscious deception.</p>

  <p>What is an impartial psychic student who is familiar with more modern
  phases to say to this development? Personally it seems to the author to have
  been a true psychic influx, blanketed and smothered by a petty sectarian
  theology of the letter-perfect description for which the Pharisees were
  reproved. If he may venture his individual opinion, it is that the perfect
  recipient of spiritual teaching is the earnest man who has worked his way
  through all the orthodox creeds, and whose mind, eager and receptive, is a
  blank surface ready to register a new impression exactly as received. He
  becomes the true child and pupil of other-world teaching, and all other types
  of Spiritualist appear to be compromises.</p>

  <p>This does not alter the fact that personal nobility of character may make
  the honest compromiser a far higher type than the pure Spiritualist, but it
  applies only to the actual philosophy. The field of Spiritualism is
  infinitely broad, and on it every variety of Christian, as well as the
  Moslem, the Hindu or the Parsee, can dwell in brotherhood. But a mere
  acceptance of spirit return and communion is not enough. Many savages have
  that. We need a moral code as well, and whether we regard Christ as a
  benevolent teacher or as a divine ambassador, His actual ethical teaching in
  one form or another, even if not coupled with His name, is an essential thing
  for the upliftment of mankind. But always it must be checked by reason, and
  acted upon in the spirit and not according to the letter.</p>

  <p>This, however, is digression. In the voices of 1831 there are the signs of
  real psychic power. It is a recognized spiritual law that all psychic
  manifestations become distorted when seen through the medium of narrow
  sectarian religion. It is also a law that pompous, inflated persons attract
  mischievous entities and are the butts of the spirit world, being made game
  of by the use of large names and by prophecies which make the prophet
  ridiculous. Such were the guides who descended upon the flock of Mr. Irving,
  and produced various effects, good or bad, according to the instrument
  used.</p>

  <p>The unity of the Church, which had been shaken by the previous censure of
  the presbytery, dissolved under this new trial. There was a large secession,
  and the building was claimed by the trustees. Irving and the stalwarts who
  were loyal to him wandered forth in search of new premises, and found them in
  the hall used by Robert Owen, the Socialist, philanthropist, and
  free-thinker, who was destined twenty years later to be one of the pioneer
  converts to Spiritualism. Here, in Gray's Inn Road, Irving rallied the
  faithful. It cannot be denied that the Church, as he organized it, with its
  angel, its elders, its deacons, its tongues, and its prophecies, was the best
  reconstruction of a primitive Christian Church that has ever been made. If
  Peter or Paul reincarnated in London they would be bewildered, and possibly
  horrified, by St. Paul's or by Westminster Cathedral, but they would
  certainly have been in a perfectly familiar atmosphere in the gathering over
  which Irving presided. A wise man recognizes that God may be approached from
  innumerable angles. The minds of men and the spirit of the times vary in
  their reaction to the great central cause, and one can only insist upon a
  broad charity both in oneself and in others. It was in this that Irving seems
  to have been wanting. It was always by the standard of that which was a sect
  among sects that he would measure the universe. There were times when he was
  vaguely conscious of this, and it may be that those wrestlings with Apollyon,
  of which he complains, even as Bunyan and the Puritans of old used to comes
  plain, had a strange explanation. Apollyon was really the Spirit of Truth,
  and the inward struggle was not between Faith and Sin, but was really between
  the darkness of inherited dogma, and the light of inherent and instinctive
  reason, God-given, and rising for ever in revolt against the absurdities of
  man.</p>

  <p>But Irving lived very intensely and the successive crises through which he
  had passed had broken him down. These contests with argumentative theologians
  and with recalcitrant members of his flock may seem trivial things to us when
  viewed far off down the vista of years, but to him, with his eager, earnest,
  storm-torn soul, they were vital and terrible. To the unfettered mind this
  sect or that seems a matter of indifference, but to Irving, both from
  heredity and from education, the Scottish Church was the ark of God, and yet
  he, its zealous, faithful son, driven by his own conscience, had rushed forth
  and had found the great gates which contained Salvation slammed and barred
  behind him. He was a branch cut from the tree, and he withered. It is a true
  simile, and it is more than a simile, for it became an actual physical fact.
  This giant in early middle age wilted and shrank. His great frame stooped.
  His cheeks became hollow and wan. His eyes shone with the baleful fever which
  was consuming him. And so, working to the very end and with the words, "If I
  die, I die with the Lord," upon his lips, his soul passed forth into that
  clearer and more golden light where the tired brain finds rest and the
  anxious spirit enters into a peace and assurance which life has never
  given.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Apart from this isolated incident of Irving's Church, there was one other
  psychic manifestation of those days which led more directly to the Hydesville
  revelation. This was the outbreak of spiritual phenomena among the Shaker
  communities in the United States, which has received less attention than it
  deserves.</p>

  <p>These good people seem to have had affiliations on the one side with the
  Quakers, and, on the other, with the refugees from the Cevennes, who came to
  England to escape the persecution of Louis XIV. Even in England their
  harmless lives did not screen them from the persecution of the bigots, and
  they were forced to emigrate to America about the time of the War of
  Independence.</p>

  <p>There they founded settlements in various parts, living simple cleanly
  lives upon communistic principles, with sobriety and chastity as their
  watchword. It is not surprising that as the psychic cloud of other-world
  power slowly settled upon the earth it should have found its first response
  from such altruistic communities. In 1837 there were sixty such bodies in
  existence, and all of them responded in various degrees to the new power.
  They kept their experiences very strictly to themselves at the time, for as
  their elders subsequently explained, they would certainly have been all
  consigned to Bedlam had they told what had actually occurred. Two books,
  however, "Holy Wisdom" and "The Sacred Roll," which arose from their
  experiences, appeared afterwards.</p>

  <p>The phenomena seem to have begun with the usual warning noises, and to
  have been followed by the obsession from time to time of nearly all the
  community. Everyone, man and woman, proved to be open to spirit possession.
  The invaders only came, however, after asking permission, and at such
  intervals as did not interfere with the work of the community. The chief
  visitants were Red Indian spirits, who came collectively as a tribe. "One or
  two elders might be in the room below, and there would be a knock at the door
  and the Indians would ask whether they might come in. Permission being given,
  a whole tribe of Indian spirits would troop into the house, and in a few
  minutes you would hear 'Whoop!' here and 'Whoop!' there all over the house."
  The whoops emanated, of course, from the vocal organs of the Shakers
  themselves, but while under the Indian control they would talk Indian among
  themselves, dance Indian dances, and in all ways show that they were really
  possessed by the Redskin spirits.</p>

  <p>One may well ask why should these North American aborigines play so large
  a part not only in the inception, but in the continuance of this movement?
  There are few physical mediums in this country, as well as in America, who
  have not a Red Indian guide, whose photograph has not infrequently been
  obtained by psychic means, still retaining his scalp-locks and his robes. It
  is one of the many mysteries which we have still to solve. We can only say
  for certain, from our own experience, that such spirits are powerful in
  producing physical phenomena, but that they never present the higher teaching
  which comes to us either from European or from Oriental spirits. The physical
  phenomena are still, however, of very great importance, as calling the
  attention of sceptics to the matter, and therefore the part assigned to the
  Indians is a very vital one. Men of the rude open-air type seem in spirit
  life to be especially associated with the crude manifestations of spirit
  activity, and it has been repeatedly asserted, though it is hard to say how
  it could be proved, that their chief organizer was an adventurer who in life
  was known as Henry Morgan, and died as Governor of Jamaica, a post to which
  he had been appointed in the time of Charles II. Such unproved assertions
  are, it must be admitted, of no value in our present state of knowledge, but
  they should be put on record as further information may in time shed some new
  light upon them. John King, which is the spirit name of the alleged Henry
  Morgan, is a very real being, and there are few Spiritualists of experience
  who have not seen his heavily-bearded face and heard his masterful voice. As
  to the Indians who are his colleagues or his subordinates, one can but hazard
  the conjecture that they are children of Nature who are nearer perhaps to the
  primitive secrets than other more complex races. It may be that their special
  work is of the nature of an expiation and atonement&mdash;an explanation
  which the author has heard from their lips.</p>

  <p>These remarks may well seem a digression from the actual experience of the
  Shakers, but the difficulties raised in the mind of the inquirer arise
  largely from the number of new facts, without any order or explanation, which
  he is forced to encounter. His mind has no possible pigeon-hole into which
  they can be fitted. Therefore, the author will endeavour in these pages to
  provide so far as possible from his own experience, or from that of those
  upon whom he can rely, such sidelights as may make the matter more
  intelligible, and give at least a hint of those laws which lie behind, and
  are as binding upon spirits as upon ourselves. Above all, the inquirer must
  cast away for ever the idea that the discarnate are necessarily wise or
  powerful entities. They have their individuality and their limitations, even
  as we have, and these limitations become the more marked when they have to
  manifest themselves through so foreign a substance as matter.</p>

  <p>The Shakers had among them a man of outstanding intelligence named F. W.
  Evans, who gave a very clear and entertaining account of all this matter,
  which may be sought by the curious in the <i>New York Daily Graphic</i> of
  November 24, 1874, and has been largely copied into Colonel Olcott's work,
  "People From the Other World."</p>

  <p>Mr. Evans and his associates after the first disturbance, physical and
  mental, caused by this spirit irruption, settled down to study what it really
  meant. They came to the conclusion that the matter could be divided into
  three phases. The first phase was the actual proving to the observer that the
  thing was real. The second phase was one of instruction, as even the humblest
  spirit can bring information as to his own experience of after-death
  conditions. The third phase was called the missionary phase and was the
  practical application. The Shakers came to the unexpected conclusion that the
  Indians were there not to teach but to be taught. They proselytized them,
  therefore, exactly as they would have done in life. A similar experience has
  occurred since then in very many Spiritualistic circles, where humble and
  lowly spirits have come to be taught that which they should have learned in
  this world had true teachers been available. One may well ask why the higher
  spirits over there do not supply this want? The answer given to the author
  upon one notable occasion was, "These people are very much nearer to you than
  to us. You can reach theta where we fail."</p>

  <p>It is clear from this that the good Shakers were never in touch with the
  higher guides&mdash;possibly they did not need guidance&mdash;and that their
  visitors were on a low plane. For seven years these visitations continued.
  When the spirits left they informed their hosts that they were going, but
  that presently they would return, and that when they did so they would
  pervade the world and enter the palace as well as the cottage. It was just
  four years later that the Rochester knockings broke out. When they did so,
  Elder Evans and another Shaker visited Rochester and saw the Fox sisters.
  Their arrival was greeted with great enthusiasm from the unseen forces, who
  proclaimed that this was indeed the work which had been foretold.</p>

  <p>One remark of Elder Evans is worth transcribing. When asked, "Don't you
  think your experience is much the same as that of monks and nuns in the
  Middle Ages?" he did not answer. "Ours were angelic but these others were
  diabolical," as would have been said had the situation been reversed, but he
  replied with fine candour and breadth of mind, "Certainly. That is the proper
  explanation of them through all the ages. The visions of Saint Theresa were
  Spiritualistic visions just such as we have frequently had vouchsafed to the
  members of our society." When further asked whether magic and necromancy did
  not belong to the same category, he answered, "Yes. That is when Spiritualism
  is used for selfish ends." It is clear that there were men living nearly a
  century ago who were capable of instructing our wise men of to-day.</p>

  <p>That very remarkable woman, Mrs. Hardinge Britten, has recorded in her
  "Modern American Spiritualism" how she came in close contact with the Shaker
  community, and was shown by them the records, taken at the time, of their
  spiritual visitation. In them it was stated that the new era was to be
  inaugurated by an extraordinary discovery of material as well as of spiritual
  wealth. This is a most remarkable prophecy, as it is a matter of history that
  the goldfields of California were discovered within a very short time of the
  psychic outburst. A Swedenborg with his doctrine of correspondences might
  perhaps contend that the one was complementary to the other.</p>

  <p>This episode of the Shaker manifestations is a very distinct link between
  the Swedenborg pioneer work and the period of Davis and the Fox sisters. We
  shall now consider the career of the former, which is intimately associated
  with the rise and progress of the modern psychic movement.</p>

    <p class="caption">Andrew Jackson Davis.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p class="first">ANDREW JACKSON DAVIS was one of the most remarkable men of
  whom we have any exact record. Born in 1826 on the banks of the Hudson, his
  mother was an uneducated woman, with a visionary turn which was allied to
  vulgar superstition, while his father was a drunken worker in leather. He has
  written the details of his own childhood in a curious book, "The Magic
  Staff," which brings home to us the primitive and yet forceful life of the
  American provinces in the first half of last century. The people were rude
  and uneducated, but their spiritual side was very much alive, and they seem
  to have been reaching out continually for some new thing. It was in these
  country districts of New York in the space of a few years that both Mormonism
  and modern Spiritualism were evolved.</p>

  <p>There never could have been a lad with fewer natural advantages than
  Davis. He was feeble in body and starved in mind. Outside an occasional
  school primer he could only recall one book that he had ever read up to his
  sixteenth year. Yet in that poor entity there lurked such spiritual forces
  that before he was twenty he had written one of the most profound and
  original books of philosophy ever produced. Could there be a clearer proof
  that nothing came from himself, and that he was but a conduit pipe through
  which flowed the knowledge of that vast reservoir which finds such
  inexplicable outlets? The valour of a Joan of Arc, the sanctity of a Theresa,
  the wisdom of a Jackson Davis, the supernormal powers of a Daniel Home, all
  come from the same source.</p>

  <p>In his later boyhood, Davis's latent psychic powers began to develop. Like
  Joan, he heard voices in the fields&mdash;gentle voices which gave him good
  advice and comfort. Clairvoyance followed this clairaudience. At the time of
  his mother's death, he had a striking vision of a lovely home in a land of
  brightness which he conjectured to be the place to which his mother had gone.
  His full capacity was tapped, however, by the chance that a travelling
  showman who exhibited the wonders of mesmerism came to the village and
  experimented upon Davis, as well as on many other young rustics who desired
  to experience the sensation. It was soon found that Davis had very remarkable
  clairvoyant powers.</p>

  <p>These were developed not by the peripatetic mesmerist, but by a local
  tailor named Levingston, who seems to have been a pioneer thinker. He was so
  intrigued by the wonderful gifts of his subject, that he abandoned his
  prosperous business and devoted his whole time to working with Davis and to
  using his clairvoyant powers for the diagnosis of disease. Davis had
  developed the power, common among psychics, of seeing without the eyes,
  including things which could not be seen in any case by human vision. At
  first, the gift was used as a sort of amusement in reading the letters or the
  watches of the assembled rustics when his eyes were bandaged. In such cases
  all parts of the body can assume the function of sight, and the reason
  probably is that the etheric or spiritual body, which possesses the same
  organs as the physical, is wholly or partially disengaged, and that it
  registers the impression. Since it might assume any posture, or might turn
  completely round, one would naturally get vision from any angle, and an
  explanation is furnished of such cases as the author met in the north of
  England, where Tom Tyrrell, the famous medium, used to walk round a room,
  admiring the pictures, with the back of his head turned towards the walls on
  which they were hung. Whether in such cases the etheric eyes see the picture,
  or whether they see the etheric duplicate of the picture, is one of the many
  problems which we leave to our descendants.</p>

  <p>Levingston used Davis at first for medical diagnosis. He described how the
  human body became transparent to his spirit eyes, which seemed to act from
  the centre of his forehead. Each organ stood out clearly and with a special
  radiance of its own which was dimmed in case of disease. To the orthodox
  medical mind, with which the author has much sympathy, such powers are
  suspect as opening a door for quackery, and yet he is bound to admit that all
  that was said by Davis has been corroborated within his own experience by Mr.
  Bloomfield, of Melbourne, who described to him the amazement which he felt
  when this power came suddenly upon him in the street, and revealed the
  anatomy of two persons who were walking in front of him. So well attested are
  such powers that it has been not unusual for medical men to engage
  clairvoyants as helpers in diagnosis. Hippocrates says, "The affections
  suffered by the body the soul sees with shut eyes." Apparently, then, the
  ancients knew something of such methods. Davis's ministrations were not
  confined to those who were in his presence, but hi; soul or etheric body
  could be liberated by the magnetic manipulation of his employer, and could be
  sent forth like a carrier pigeon with the certainty that it would come home
  again bearing any desired information. Apart from the humanitarian mission on
  which it was usually engaged it would sometimes roam at will, and he has
  described in wonderful passages how he would see a translucent earth beneath
  him, with the great veins of mineral beds shining through like masses of
  molten metal, each with its own fiery radiance.</p>

  <p>It is notable that at this earlier phase of Davis's psychic experience he
  had no memory when he returned from trance of what his impressions had been.
  They were registered, however, upon his subconscious mind, and at a later
  date he recalled them all clearly. For the time he was a source of
  instruction to others but remained ignorant himself.</p>

  <p>Until then his development had been on lines which are not uncommon, and
  which could be matched within the experience of every psychic student. But
  then there occurred an episode which was entirely novel and which is
  described in close detail in the autobiography. Put briefly, the facts were
  these. On the evening of March 6, 1844, Davis was suddenly possessed by some
  power which led him to fly from the little town of Poughkeepsie, where he
  lived, and to hurry off, in a condition of semi-trance, upon a rapid journey.
  When he regained his clear perceptions he found himself among wild mountains,
  and there he claims to have met two venerable men with whom he held intimate
  and elevating communion, the one upon medicine and the other upon morals. All
  night he was out, and when he inquired his whereabouts next morning he was
  told that he was in the Catskill Mountains and forty miles from his home. The
  whole narrative reads like a subjective experience, a dream or a vision, and
  one would not hesitate to place it as such were it not for the details of his
  reception and the meal he ate upon his return. It is a possible alternative
  that the flight into the mountains was a reality and the interviews a dream.
  He claims that he afterwards identified his two mentors as Galen and
  Swedenborg, which is interesting as being the first contact with the dead
  which he had ever recognized. The whole episode seems visionary, and had no
  direct bearing upon the lad's remarkable future.</p>

  <p>He felt higher powers stirring within him, and it was remarked to him that
  when he was asked profound questions in the mesmeric trance he always
  replied, "I will answer that in my book." In his nineteenth year he felt that
  the hour for writing the book had come. The mesmeric influence of Levingston
  did not, for some reason, seem suited for this, and a Dr. Lyon was chosen as
  the new mesmerist. Lyon threw up his practice and went with his singular
  protege to New York, where they presently called upon the Rev. William
  Fishbough to come and act as amanuensis. The intuitional selection seems to
  have been justified, for he also at once gave up his work and obeyed the
  summons. Then, the apparatus being ready, Lyon threw the lad day after day
  into the magnetic trance, and his utterances were taken down by the faithful
  secretary. There was no money and no publicity in the matter, and even the
  most sceptical critic cannot but admit that the occupation and objects of
  these three men were a wonderful contrast to the money-making material world
  which surrounded them. They were reaching out to the beyond, and what can man
  do that is nobler?</p>

  <p>It is to be understood that a pipe can carry no more than its own diameter
  permits. The diameter of Davis was very different from that of Swedenborg.
  Each got knowledge while in an illuminated state. But Swedenborg was the most
  learned man in Europe, while Davis was as ignorant a young man as could be
  found in the State of New York. Swedenborg's revelation was perhaps the
  greater, though more likely to be tinged by his own brain. The revelation of
  Davis was incomparably the greater miracle.</p>

  <p>Dr. George Bush, Professor of Hebrew in the University of New York, who
  was one of those present while the trance orations were being taken down,
  writes:</p>

  <p class="quote">I can solemnly affirm that I have heard Davis correctly
quote the Hebrew
  language in his lectures, and display a knowledge of geology which would have
  been astonishing in a person of his age, even if he had devoted years to the
  study. He has discussed, with the most signal ability, the profoundest
  questions of historical and biblical archeology, of mythology, of the origin
  and affinity of language, and the progress of civilization among the
  different nations of the globe, which would do honour to any scholar of the
  age, even if in reaching them he had the advantage of access to all the
  libraries in Christendom. Indeed, if he had acquired all the information he
  gives forth in these lectures, not in the two years since he left the
  shoemaker's bench, but in his whole life, with the most assiduous study, no
  prodigy of intellect of which the world has ever heard would be for a moment
  compared with him, yet not a single volume or page has he ever read.</p>

  <p>Davis has a remarkable pen-picture of himself at that moment. He asks us
  to take stock of his equipment. "The circumference of his head is unusually
  small," says he. "If size is the measure of power, then this youth's mental
  capacity is unusually limited. His lungs are weak and unexpanded. He had not
  dwelt amid refining influences&mdash;manners ungentle and awkward. He has not
  read a book save one. He knows nothing of grammar or the rules of language,
  nor associated with literary or scientific persons." Such was the lad of
  nineteen from whom there now poured a perfect cataract of words and ideas
  which are open to the criticism not of simplicity, but of being too complex
  and too shrouded in learned terms, although always with a consistent thread
  of reason and method beneath them.</p>

  <p>It is very well to talk of the subconscious mind, but this has usually
  been taken as the appearance of ideas which have been received and then
  submerged. When, for example, the developed Davis could recall what had
  happened in his trances during his undeveloped days, that was a clear
  instance of the emerging of the buried impressions. But it seems an abuse of
  words to talk of the unconscious mind when we are dealing with something
  which could never by normal means have reached any stratum of the mind,
  whether conscious or not.</p>

  <p>Such was the beginning of Davis's great psychic revelation which extended
  eventually over many books and is all covered by the name of the "Harmonica
  Philosophy." Of its nature and its place in psychic teaching we shall treat
  later.</p>

  <p>In this phase of his life Davis claims still to have been under the direct
  influence of the person whom he afterwards identified as Swedenborg&mdash;a
  name quite unfamiliar to him at the time. From time to time he received a
  clairaudient summons to "go up into the mountain." This mountain was a hill
  on the farther bank of the Hudson opposite Poughkeepsie. There on the
  mountain he claims that he met and spoke with a venerable figure. There seems
  to have been none of the details of a materialization, and the incident has
  no analogy in our psychic experience, save indeed&mdash;and one speaks with
  all reverence&mdash;when the Christ also went up into a mountain and communed
  with the forms of Moses and Elias. There the analogy seems complete.</p>

  <p>Davis does not appear to have been at all a religious man in the ordinary
  conventional sense, although he was drenched with true spiritual power. His
  views, so far as one can follow them, were very critical as regards Biblical
  revelation, and, to put it at the lowest, he was no believer in literal
  interpretation. But he was honest, earnest, unvenal, anxious to get the truth
  and conscious of his responsibility in spreading it.</p>

  <p>For two years the unconscious Davis continued to dictate his book upon the
  secrets of Nature, while the conscious Davis did a little self-education in
  New York with occasional restorative visits to Poughkeepsie. He had begun to
  attract the attention of some serious people, Edgar Allan Poe being one of
  his visitors. His psychic development went on, and before he reached his
  twenty-first year he had attained a state when he needed no second person to
  throw him into trance but could do it for himself. His subconscious memory
  too was at last opened, and he was able to go over the whole long vista of
  his experiences. It was at this time that he sat by a dying woman and
  observed every detail of the soul's departure, a wonderful description of
  which is given in the first volume of the "Great Harmonia." Although this
  description has been issued as a separate pamphlet it is not as well known as
  it should be, and a short epitome of it may interest the reader.</p>

  <p>He begins by the consoling reflection that his own soul-flights, which
  were death in everything save duration, had shown him that the experience was
  "interesting and delightful," and that those symptoms which appear to be
  signs of pain are really the unconscious reflexes of the body, and have no
  significance. He then tells how, having first thrown himself into what he
  calls the "Superior condition," he thus observed the stages from the
  spiritual side. "The material eye can only see what is material, and the
  spiritual what is spiritual," but as everything would seem to have a
  spiritual counterpart the result is the same. Thus when a spirit comes to us
  it is not us that it perceives but our etheric bodies, which are, however,
  duplicates of our real ones.</p>

  <p>It was this etheric body which Davis saw emerging from its poor outworn
  envelope of protoplasm, which finally lay empty upon the bed like the
  shrivelled chrysalis when the moth is free. The process began by an extreme
  concentration in the brain, which became more and more luminous as the
  extremities became darker. It is probable that man never thinks so clearly,
  or is so intensely conscious, as he becomes after all means of indicating his
  thoughts have left him. Then the new body begins to emerge, the head
  disengaging itself first. Soon it has completely freed itself, standing at
  right-angles to the corpse, with its feet near the head, and with some
  luminous vital band between which corresponds to the umbilical cord. When the
  cord snaps a small portion is drawn back into the dead body, and it is this
  which preserves it from instant putrefaction. As to the etheric body, it
  takes some little time to adapt itself to its new surroundings, and in this
  instance it then passed out through the open doors. "I saw her pass through
  the adjoining room, out of the door and step from the house into the
  atmosphere . Immediately upon her emergement from the house she was joined by
  two friendly spirits from the spiritual country, and after tenderly
  recognizing and communing with each other the three, in the most graceful
  manner, began ascending obliquely through the ethereal envelopment of our
  globe. They walked so naturally and fraternally together that I could
  scarcely realize the fact that they trod the air&mdash;they seemed to be
  walking on the side of a glorious but familiar mountain. I continued to gaze
  upon them until the distance shut them from my view."</p>

  <p>Such is the vision of Death as seen by A. J. Davis&mdash;a very different
  one from that dark horror which has so long obsessed the human imagination.
  If this be the truth, then we can sympathize with Dr. Hodgson in his
  exclamation, "I can hardly bear to wait." But is it true? We can only say
  that there is a great deal of corroborative evidence.</p>

  <p>Many who have been in the cataleptic condition, or who have been so ill
  that they have sunk into deep coma, have brought back impressions very
  consistent with Davis's explanation, though others have returned with their
  minds completely blank. The author, when at Cincinnati in 1923, was brought
  into contact with a Mrs. Monk, who had been set down as dead by her doctors,
  and for an hour or so had experienced a post-mortem existence before some
  freak of fate restored her to life. She wrote a short account of her
  experience, in which she had a vivid remembrance of walking out of the room,
  just as Davis described, and also of the silver thread which continued to
  unite her living soul to her comatose body. A remarkable case was reported in
  <i>Light</i>, also (March 25, 1922), in which the five daughters of a dying
  woman, all of them clairvoyant, watched and reported the process of their
  mother's death. There again the description of the process was very analogous
  to that given, and yet there is sufficient difference in this and other
  accounts to suggest that the sequence of events is not always regulated by
  the same laws. Another variation of extreme interest is to be found in a
  drawing done by a child medium which depicts the soul leaving the body and is
  described in Mrs. De Morgan's "From Matter to Spirit" (p. 121). This book,
  with its weighty preface by the celebrated mathematician Professor De Morgan,
  is one of the pioneer works of the spiritual movement in Great Britain. When
  one reflects that it was published in 1863 one's heart grows heavy at the
  success of those forces of obstruction, reflected so strongly in the Press,
  which have succeeded for so many years in standing between God's message and
  the human race.</p>

  <p>The prophetic power of Davis can only be got over by the sceptic if he
  ignores the record. Before 1856 he prophesied in detail the coining of the
  motor car and of the typewriter. In his book, "The Penetralia," appears the
  following:</p>

  <p class="quote">"Question: Will utilitarianism make any discoveries in
other locomotive
  directions?"</p>

  <p class="quote">"Yes; look out about these days for carriages and
travelling saloons on
  country roads&mdash;without horses, without steam, without any visible motive
  power moving with greater speed and far more safety than at present.
  Carriages will be moved by a strange and beautiful and simple admixture of
  aqueous and atmospheric gases&mdash;so easily condensed, so simply ignited,
  and so imparted by a machine somewhat resembling our engines, as to be
  entirely concealed and manageable between the forward wheels. These vehicles
  will prevent many embarrassments now experienced by persons living in thinly
  populated territories. The first requisite for these land-locomotives will be
  good roads, upon which with your engine, without your horses, you may travel
  with great rapidity. These carriages seem to me of uncomplicated
  construction."</p>

  <p class="quote">"He was next asked:</p>

  <p class="quote">"Do you perceive any plan by which to expedite the art of
writing?"</p>

  <p class="quote">"Yes; I am almost moved to invent an automatic
psychographer&mdash;that
  is, an artificial soul-writer. It may be constructed something like a piano,
  one brace or scale of keys to represent the elementary sounds; another and
  lower tier to represent a combination, and still another for a rapid
  re-combination; so that a person, instead of playing a piece of music, may
  touch off a sermon or a poem."</p>

  <p>So, too, this seer, in reply to a query regarding what was then termed
  "atmospheric navigation," felt "deeply impressed" that "the necessary
  mechanism&mdash;to transcend the adverse currents of air, so that we may sail
  as easily and safely and pleasantly as birds&mdash;is dependent on a new
  motive power. This power will come. It will not only move the locomotive on
  the rail, and the carriage on the country road, but the aerial cars also,
  which will move through the sky from country to country."</p>

  <p>He predicted the coming of Spiritualism in his "Principles of Nature,"
  published in 1847, where he says:</p>

  <p class="quote">It is a truth that spirits commune with one another while
one is in the
  body and the other in the higher spheres&mdash;and this, too, when the person
  in the body is unconscious of the influx, and hence cannot be convinced of
  the fact; and this truth will ere long present itself in the form of a living
  demonstration. And the world will hail with delight the ushering-in of that
  era when the interiors of men will be opened, and the spiritual communion
  will be established such as is now being enjoyed by the inhabitants of Mars,
  Jupiter and Saturn.</p>

  <p>In this matter Davis's teaching was definite, but it must be admitted that
  in a good deal of his work he is indefinite and that it is hard reading, for
  it is disfigured by the use of long words, and occasionally he even invents a
  vocabulary of his own. It was, however, on a very high moral and intellectual
  level, and might be best described as an up-to-date Christianity with
  Christ's ethics applied to modern problems and entirely freed from all trace
  of dogma. "Documentary Religion," as Davis called it, was not in his opinion
  religion at all. That name could only be applied to the personal product of
  reason and spirituality. Such was the general line of teaching, mixed up with
  many revelations of Nature, which was laid down in the successive books of
  the "Harmonial Philosophy" which succeeded "Nature's Divine Revelations," and
  occupied the next few years of his life. Much of the teaching appeared in a
  strange paper called "The Univercoelum," and much was spread by lectures in
  which he laid before the public the results of his revelations.</p>

  <p>In his spiritual vision Davis saw an arrangement of the universe which
  corresponds closely with that which Swedenborg had already noted, and with
  that afterwards taught by the spirits and accepted by the Spiritualists. He
  saw a life which resembled that of earth, a life that may be called
  semi-material, with pleasures and pursuits that would appeal to our natures
  which had been by no means changed by death. He saw study for the studious,
  congenial tasks for the energetic, art for the artistic, beauty for the lover
  of Nature, rest for the weary ones. He saw graduated phases of spiritual
  life, through which one slowly rose to the sublime and the celestial. He
  carried his magnificent vision onward beyond the present universe, and saw it
  dissolve once more into the fire-mist from which it had consolidated, and
  then consolidate once more to form the stage on which a higher evolution
  could take place, the highest class here starting as the lowest class there.
  This process he saw renew itself innumerable times, covering trillions of
  years, and ever working towards refinement and purification. These spheres he
  pictured as concentric rings round the world, but as he admits that neither
  time nor space define themselves clearly in his visions, we need not take
  their geography in too literal a sense. The object of life was to qualify for
  advancement in this tremendous scheme, and the best method of human
  advancement was to get away from sin&mdash;not only the sins which are
  usually recognized, but also those sins of bigotry, narrowness and hardness,
  which are very especially blemishes not of the ephemeral flesh but of the
  permanent spirit. For this purpose the return to simple life, simple beliefs,
  and primitive brotherhood was essential. Money, alcohol, lust, violence and
  priestcraft&mdash;in its narrow sense&mdash;were the chief impediments to
  racial progress.</p>

  <p>It must be admitted that Davis, so far as one can follow his life, lived
  up to his own professions. He was very humble-minded, and yet he was of the
  stuff that saints are made of. His autobiography extends only to 1857, so
  that he was little over thirty when he published it, but it gives a very
  complete and sometimes an involuntary insight into the man. He was very poor,
  but he was just and charitable. He was very earnest, and yet he was patient
  in argument and gentle under contradiction. The worst motives were imputed to
  him, and he records them with a tolerant smile. He gives a full account of
  his first two marriages, which were as unusual as everything else about him,
  but which reflect nothing but credit upon him. From the date at which "The
  Magic Staff" finishes he seems to have carried on the same life of alternate
  writing and lecturing, winning more and more the ear of the world, until he
  died in the year 1910 at the age of eighty-four. The last years of his life
  he spent as keeper of some small book-store in Boston. The fact that his
  "Harmonial Philosophy" has now passed through some forty editions in the
  United States is a proof that the seed which he scattered so assiduously has
  not all fallen upon barren ground.</p>

  <p>What is of importance to us is the part played by Davis at the
  commencement of the spiritual revelation. He began to prepare the ground
  before that revelation occurred. He was clearly destined to be closely
  associated with it, for he was aware of the material demonstration at
  Hydesville upon the very day when it occurred. From his notes there is quoted
  the sentence, under the vital date of March 31, 1848: "About daylight this
  morning a warm breathing passed over my face and I heard a voice, tender and
  strong, saying, 'Brother, the good work has begun&mdash;behold, a living
  demonstration is born.' I was left wondering what could be meant by such a
  message." It was the beginning of the mighty movement in which he was to act
  as prophet. His own powers were themselves supernormal upon the mental side,
  just as the physical signs were upon the material side. Each supplemented the
  other. He was, up to the limit of his capacity, the soul of the movement, the
  one brain which had a clear vision of the message which was heralded in so
  novel and strange a way. No man can take the whole message, for it is
  infinite, and rises ever higher as we come into contact with higher beings,
  but Davis interpreted it so well for his day and generation that little can
  be added even now to his conception.</p>

  <p>He had advanced one step beyond Swedenborg, though he had not Swedenborg's
  mental equipment with which to marshal his results. Swedenborg had seen a
  heaven and hell, even as Davis saw it and has described it with fuller
  detail. Swedenborg did not, however, get a clear vision of the position of
  the dead and the true nature of the spirit world with the possibility of
  return as it was revealed to the American seer. This knowledge came slowly to
  Davis. His strange interviews with what he described as "materialized
  spirits" were exceptional things, and he drew no common conclusions from
  them. It was later when he was brought into contact with actual spiritual
  phenomena that he was able to see the full meaning of them. This contact was
  not established at Rochester, but rather at Stratford in Connecticut, where
  Davis was a witness of the Poltergeist phenomena which broke out in the
  household of a clergyman, Dr. Phelps, in the early months of 1850. A study of
  these led him to write a pamphlet, "The Philosophy of Spiritual Intercourse,"
  expanded afterwards to a book which contains much which the world has not yet
  mastered. Some of it, in its wise restraint, may also be commended to some
  Spiritualists. "Spiritualism is useful as a living demonstration of a future
  existence," he says. "Spirits have aided me many times, but they do not
  control either my person or my reason. They can and do perform kindly offices
  for those on earth. But benefits can only be secured on the condition that we
  allow them to become our teachers and not our masters&mdash;that we accept
  them as companions, not as gods to be worshipped." Wise words&mdash;and a
  modern restatement of the vital remark of Saint Paul that the prophet must
  not be subject to his own gifts.</p>

  <p>In order to explain adequately the life of Davis one has to ascend to
  supernormal conditions. But even then there are alternative explanations.
  When one considers the following undeniable facts:</p>

  <p>1. That he claims to have seen and heard the materialized form of
  Swedenborg before he knew anything of his teachings.</p>

  <p>2. That <i>something</i> possessed this ignorant youth, which gave him
  great knowledge.</p>

  <p>3. That this knowledge took the same broad sweeping universal lines which
  were characteristic of Swedenborg.</p>

  <p>4. But that they went one step farther, having added just that knowledge
  of spirit power which Swedenborg may have attained after his death.</p>

  <p>Considering these four points, then, is it not a feasible hypothesis that
  the power which controlled Davis was actually Swedenborg? It would be well if
  the estimable but very narrow and limited New Church took such possibilities
  into account. But whether Davis stood alone, or whether he was the reflection
  of one greater than himself, the fact remains that he was a miracle man, the
  inspired, learned, uneducated apostle of the new dispensation. So permanent
  has been his influence that the well-known artist and critic Mr. E. Wake
  Cook, in his remarkable book "Retrogression in Art,"* harks back to Davis's
  teaching as the one modern influence which could recast the world. Davis left
  his mark deep upon Spiritualism. "Summerland," for example, as a name for the
  modern Paradise, and the whole system of Lyceum schools with their ingenious
  organization, are of his devising. As Mr. Baseden Butt has remarked, "Even
  to-day the full and final extent of his influence is extremely difficult, if
  not impossible, to assess."</p>

  </div><br>

  <p class="first">WE have now traced various disconnected and irregular
  uprushes of psychic force in the cases which have been set forth, and we come
  at last to the particular episode which was really on a lower level than
  those which had gone before, but which occurred within the ken of a practical
  people who found means to explore it thoroughly and to introduce reason and
  system into what had been a mere object of aimless wonder. It is true that
  the circumstances were lowly, the actors humble, the place remote, and the
  communication sordid, being based on no higher motive than revenge. When,
  however, in the everyday affairs of this world one wishes to test whether a
  telegraphic wire is in operation, one notices whether a message comes
  through, and the high or low nature of that message is quite a secondary
  consideration. It is said that the first message which actually came through
  the Transatlantic cable was a commonplace inquiry from the testing engineer.
  None the less, kings and presidents have used it since. So it is that the
  humble spirit of the murdered peddler of Hydesville may have opened a gap
  into which the angels have thronged. There is good and bad and all that is
  intermediate on the Other Side as on this side of the veil. The company you
  attract depends upon yourself and your own motives.</p>

  <p>Hydesville is a typical little hamlet of New York State, with a primitive
  population which was, no doubt, half-educated, but was probably, like the
  rest of those small American centres of life, more detached from prejudice
  and more receptive of new ideas than any other set of people at that time.
  This particular village, situated about twenty miles from the rising town of
  Rochester, consisted of a cluster of wooden houses of a very humble type. It
  was in one of these, a residence which would certainly not pass the
  requirements of a British district council surveyor, that there began this
  development which is already, in the opinion of many, by far the most
  important thing that America has given to the commonweal of the world. It was
  inhabited by a decent farmer family of the name of Fox&mdash;a name which, by
  a curious coincidence, has already been registered in religious history as
  that of the apostle of the Quakers. Besides the father and mother, who were
  Methodists in religion, there were two children resident in the house at the
  time when the manifestations reached such a point of intensity that they
  attracted general attention. These children were the daughters &mdash;
  Margaret, aged fourteen, and Kate, aged eleven. There were several other
  children out in the world, of whom only one, Leah, who was teaching music in
  Rochester, need come into this narrative.</p>

  <p>The little house had already established a somewhat uncanny reputation.
  The evidence to this effect was collected and published very shortly after
  the event, and seems to be as reliable as such evidence can be. In view of
  the extreme importance of everything which bears upon the matter, some
  extracts from these depositions must be inserted, but to avoid dislocation of
  the narrative the evidence upon this point has been relegated to the
  Appendix. We will therefore pass at once to the time of the tenancy of the
  Fox family, who took over the house on December 11, 1847. It was not until
  the next year that the sounds heard by the previous tenants began once more.
  These sounds consisted of rapping noises. A rap would seem to be the not
  unnatural sound to be produced by outside visitors when they wished to notify
  their presence at the door of human life and desired that door to be opened
  for them. Just such raps (all unknown to these unread farmers) had occurred
  in England in 1661 at the house of Mr. Mompesson, at Tedworth.* Raps, too,
  are recorded by Melancthon as having occurred at Oppenheim, in Germany, in
  1520, and raps were heard at the Epworth Vicarage in 1716. Here they were
  once more, and at last they were destined to have the closed door open.</p>

  <p class="footnote">* <i>Saducismus Triumphatus</i>, by Rev. Joseph
  Glanvil.</p>

  <p>The noises do not seem to have incommoded the Fox family until the middle
  of March, 1848. From that date onwards they continually increased in
  intensity. Sometimes they were a mere knocking; at other times they sounded
  like the movement of furniture. The children were so alarmed that they
  refused to sleep apart and were taken into the bedroom of their parents. So
  vibrant were the sounds that the beds thrilled and shook. Every possible
  search was made, the husband waiting on one side of the door and the wife on
  the other, but the rappings still continued. It was soon noticed that
  daylight was inimical to the phenomena, and this naturally strengthened the
  idea of trickery, but every possible solution was tested and failed. Finally,
  upon the night of March 31 there was a very loud and continued outbreak of
  inexplicable sounds. It was on this night that one of the great points of
  psychic evolution was reached, for it was then that young Kate Fox challenged
  the unseen power to repeat the snaps of her fingers. That rude room, with its
  earnest, expectant, half-clad occupants with eager upturned faces, its circle
  of candlelight, and its heavy shadows lurking in the corners, might well be
  made the subject of a great historical painting. Search all the palaces and
  chancelleries of 1848, and where will you find a chamber which has made its
  place in history as secure as this little bedroom of a shack?</p>

  <p>The child's challenge, though given with flippant words, was instantly
  answered. Every snap was echoed by a knock. However humble the operator at
  either end, the spiritual telegraph was at last working, and it was left to
  the patience and moral earnestness of the human race to determine how high
  might be the uses to which it was put in the future. Unexplained forces were
  many in the world, but here was a force claiming to have independent
  intelligence at the back of it. That was the supreme sign of a new
  departure.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Fox was amazed at this development, and at the further discovery that
  the force could apparently see as well as hear, for when Kate snapped her
  fingers without sound the rap still responded. The mother asked a series of
  questions, the answers to which, given in numerals, showed a greater
  knowledge of her own affairs than she herself possessed, for the raps
  insisted that she had had seven children, whereas she protested that she had
  borne only six, until one who had died early came back to her mind. A
  neighbour, Mrs. Redfield, was called in, and her amusement was changed to
  wonder, and finally to awe, as she also listened to correct answers to
  intimate questions.</p>

  <p>The neighbours came flocking in as some rumours of these wonders got
  about, and the two children were carried off by one of them, while Mrs. Fox
  went to spend the night at Mrs. Redfield's. In their absence the phenomena
  went on exactly the same as before, which disposes once for all of those
  theories of cracking toes and dislocating knees which have been so frequently
  put forward by people unaware of the true facts.</p>

  <p>Having formed a sort of informal committee of investigation, the crowd, in
  shrewd Yankee fashion, spent a large part of the night of March 31 in playing
  question and answer with the unseen intelligence. According to its own
  account he was a spirit; he had been injured in that house; he rapped out the
  name of a former occupant who had injured him; he was thirty-one years old at
  the time of death (which was five years before); he had been murdered for
  money; he had been buried in the cellar ten feet deep. On descending to the
  cellar, dull, heavy thumps, coming apparently from under the earth, broke out
  when the investigator stood at the centre. There was no sound at other times.
  That, then, was the place of burial! It was a neighbour named Duesler who,
  first of all modern men, called over the alphabet and got answers by raps on
  the letters. In this way the name of the dead man was obtained &mdash;
  Charles B. Rosma. The idea of connected messages was not developed until four
  months later, when Isaac Post, a Quaker, of Rochester, was the pioneer.
  These, in very brief outline, were the events of March 31, which were
  continued and confirmed upon the succeeding night, when not fewer than a
  couple of hundred people had assembled round the house. Upon April 2 it was
  observed that the raps came in the day as well as at night.</p>

  <p>Such is a synopsis of the events of the night of March 31, 1848, but as it
  was the small root out of which sprang so great a tree, and as this whole
  volume may be said to be a monument to its memory, it would seem fitting that
  the story should be given in the very words of the two original adult
  witnesses. Their evidence was taken within four days of the occurrence, and
  forms part of that admirable piece of psychic research upon the part of the
  local committee which will be described and commented upon later. Mrs. Fox
  deposed:</p>

  <p>On the night of the first disturbance we all got up, lighted a candle and
  searched the entire house, the noises continuing during the time, and being
  heard near the same place. Although not very loud, it produced a jar of the
  bedsteads and chairs that could be felt when we were in bed. It was a
  tremulous motion, more than a sudden jar. We could feel the jar when standing
  on the floor. It continued on this night until we slept. I did not sleep
  until about twelve o'clock. On March 30th we were disturbed all night. The
  noises were heard in all parts of the house. My husband stationed himself
  outside of the door while I stood inside, and the knocks came on the door
  between us. We heard footsteps in the pantry, and walking downstairs; we
  could not rest, and I then concluded that the house must be haunted by some
  unhappy restless spirit. I had often heard of such things, but had never
  witnessed anything of the kind that I could not account for before.</p>

  <p>On Friday night, March 31st, 1848, we concluded to go to bed early and not
  permit ourselves to be disturbed by the noises, but try and get a night's
  rest. My husband was here on all these occasions, heard the noises, and
  helped search. It was very early when we went to bed on this night &mdash;
  hardly dark. I had been so broken of my rest I was almost sick. My husband
  had not gone to bed when we first heard the noise on this evening. I had just
  lain down. It commenced as usual. I knew it from all other noises I had ever
  heard before. The children, who slept in the other bed in the room, heard the
  rapping, and tried to make similar sounds by snapping their fingers.</p>

  <p>My youngest child, Cathie, said: "Mr. Splitfoot, do as I do," clapping her
  hands. The sound instantly followed her with the same number of raps. When
  she stopped, the sound ceased for a short time. Then Margaretta said, in
  sport, "Now, do just as I do. Count one, two, three, four," striking one hand
  against the other at the same time; and the raps came as before. She was
  afraid to repeat them. Then Cathie said in her childish simplicity, "Oh,
  mother, I know what it is. To-morrow is April-fool day, and it's somebody
  trying to fool us."</p>

  <p>I then thought I could put a test that no one in the place could answer. I
  asked the noise to rap my different children's ages, successively. Instantly,
  each one of my children's ages was given correctly, pausing between them
  sufficiently long to individualize them until the seventh, at which a longer
  pause was made, and then three more emphatic raps were given, corresponding
  to the age of the little one that died, which was my youngest child.</p>

  <p>I then asked: "Is this a human being that answers my questions so
  correctly?" There was no rap. I asked: "Is it a spirit? If it is, make two
  raps." Two sounds were given as soon as the request was made. I then said "If
  it was an injured spirit, make two raps," which were instantly made, causing
  the house to tremble. I asked: "Were you injured in this house?" The answer
  was given as before. "Is the person living that injured you?"</p>

  <p>Answered by raps in the same manner. I ascertained by the same method that
  it was a man, aged thirty-one years, that he had been murdered in this house,
  and his remains were buried in the cellar; that his family consisted of a
  wife and five children, two sons and three daughters, all living at the time
  of his death, but that his wife had since died. I asked: "Will you continue
  to rap if I call my neighbours that they may hear it too?" The raps were loud
  in the affirmative.</p>

  <p>My husband went and called in Mrs. Redfield, our nearest neighbour. She is
  a very candid woman. The girls were sitting up in bed clinging to each other,
  and trembling with terror. I think I was as calm as I am now. Mrs. Redfield
  came immediately (this was about half-past seven), thinking she would have a
  laugh at the children. But when she saw them pale with fright, and nearly
  speechless, she was amazed, and believed there was something more serious
  than she had supposed. I asked a few questions for her, and was answered as
  before. He told her age exactly. She then called her husband, and the same
  questions were asked and answered.</p>

  <p>Then Mr. Redfield called in Mr. Duesler and wife, and several others. Mr.
  Duesler then called in Mr. and Mrs. Hyde, also Mr. and Mrs. Jewell. Mr.
  Duesler asked many questions, and received answers. I then named all the
  neighbours I could think of, and asked if any of them had injured him, and
  received no answer. Mr. Duesler then asked questions and received answers. He
  asked: "Were you murdered?" Raps affirmative. "Can your murderer be brought
  to justice?" No sound. "Can he be punished by the law?" No answer. He then
  said: "If your murderer cannot be punished by the law, manifest it by raps,"
  and the raps were made clearly and distinctly. In the same way, Mr. Duesler
  ascertained that he was murdered in the east bedroom about five years ago and
  that the murder was committed by a Mr. on a Tuesday night at twelve o'clock;
  that he was murdered by having his throat cut with a butcher knife; that the
  body was taken down to the cellar; that it was not buried until the next
  night; that it was taken through the buttery, down the stairway, and that it
  was buried ten feet below the surface of the ground. It was also ascertained
  that he was murdered for his money, by raps affirmative.</p>

  <p>"How much was it&mdash;one hundred?" No rap. "Was it two hundred?" etc.,
  and when he mentioned five hundred the raps replied in the affirmative.</p>

  <p>Many called in who were fishing in the creek, and all heard the same
  questions and answers. Many remained in the house all night. I and my
  children left the house.</p>

  <p>My husband remained in the house with Mr. Redfield all night. On the next
  Saturday the house was filled to overflowing. There were no sounds heard
  during day, but they commenced again in the evening. It was said that there
  were over three hundred persons present at the time. On Sunday morning the
  noises were heard throughout the day by all who came to the house.</p>

  <p>On Saturday night, April 1st, they commenced digging in the cellar; they
  dug until they carne to water, and then gave it up. The noise was not heard
  on Sunday evening nor during the night. Stephen B. Smith and wife (my
  daughter Marie), and my son David S. Fox and wife, slept in the room this
  night.</p>

  <p>I have heard nothing since that time until yesterday. In the forenoon of
  yesterday there were several questions answered in the usual way by rapping.
  I have heard the noise several times to-day.</p>

  <p>I am not a believer in haunted houses or supernatural appearances. I am
  very sorry that there has been so much excitement about it. It has been a
  great deal of trouble to us. It was our misfortune to live here at this time;
  but I am willing and anxious that the truth should be known, and that a true
  statement should be made. I cannot account for these noises; all that I know
  is that they have been heard repeatedly, as I have stated. I have heard this
  rapping again this (Tuesday) morning, April 4. My children also heard it.</p>

  <p>I certify that the foregoing statement has been read to me, and that the
  same is true; and that I should be willing to take my oath that it is so, if
  necessary."</p>

  <p>(<i>Signed</i>) MARGARET FOX.</p>

   <p><i>April</i> 11, 1848.</p>
   <br>

  <p class="cp"><em>Statement by John D. Fox</em></p>

  <p>I have heard the above statement of my wife, Margaret Fox, read, and
  hereby certify that the same is true in all its particulars. I heard the same
  rappings which she has spoken of, in answer to the questions, as stated by
  her. There have been a great many questions besides those asked, and answered
  in the same way. Some have been asked a great many times, and they have
  always received the same answers. There has never been any contradiction
  whatever.</p>

  <p>I do not know of any way to account for those noises, as being caused by
  any natural means. We have searched every nook and corner in and about the
  house, at different times, to ascertain, if possible, whether anything or
  anybody was secreted there that could make the noise, and have not been able
  to find anything which would or could explain the mystery. It has caused a
  great deal of trouble and anxiety.</p>

  <p>Hundreds have visited the house, so that it is impossible for us to attend
  to our daily occupations; and I hope that, whether caused by natural or
  supernatural means, it will be ascertained soon. The digging in the cellar
  will be resumed as soon as the water settles, and then it can be ascertained
  whether there are any indications of a body ever having been buried there;
  and if there are, I shall have no doubt but that it is of supernatural
  origin.</p>

  <p>(<i>Signed</i>) JOHN D. FOX.</p>

  <p><i>April </i>11, 1848</p>
  <br>

  <p>The neighbours had formed themselves into a committee of investigation,
  which for sanity and efficiency might be a lesson to many subsequent re
  searchers. They did not begin by imposing their own conditions, but they
  started without prejudice to record the facts exactly as they found them. Not
  only did they collect and record the impressions of everyone concerned, but
  they actually had the evidence in printed form within a month of the
  occurrence. The author has in vain attempted to get an original copy of the
  pamphlet, "A Report of the Mysterious Noises heard in the House of Mr. John
  D. Fox," published at Canandaigua, New York, but he has been presented with a
  facsimile of the original, and it is his considered opinion that the fact of
  human survival and power of communication was definitely proved to any mind
  capable of weighing evidence from the day of the appearance of that document.
  71</p>

  <p>The statement made by Mr. Duesler, chief of the committee, gives important
  testimony to the occurrence of the noises and jars in the absence of the Fox
  girls from the house, and disposes once and for ever of all suspicion of
  their complicity in these events. Mrs. Fox, as we have seen, referring to the
  night of Friday, March 31, said: "I and my children left the house." Part of
  Mr. Duesler's statement reads:</p>

  <p class="quote">I live within a few rods of the house in which these sounds
have been
  heard. The first I heard anything about them was a week ago last Friday
  evening (March 31st). Mrs. Redfield came over to my house to get my wife to
  go over to Mrs. Fox's. Mrs. R. appeared to be very much agitated. My wife
  wanted me to go over with them, and I accordingly went . This was about nine
  o'clock in the evening. There were some twelve or fourteen persons present
  when I left them. Some were so frightened that they did not want to go into
  the room.</p>

  <p class="quote">I went into the room and sat down on the bed. Mr. Fox asked
a question and
  I heard the rapping, which they had spoken of, distinctly. I felt the
  bedstead jar when the sounds were produced.</p>

  <p>The Hon. Robert Dale Owen,* a member of the United States Congress, and
  formerly American Minister to Naples, supplies a few additional particulars
  in his narrative, written after conversations with Mrs. Fox and her
  daughters, Margaret and Catharine. Describing the night of March 31, 1848, he
  says ("Footfalls, etc.," p. 287):</p>

  <p class="footnote">* Author of <i>Footfalls On The Boundary Of Another
  World</i> (1860), and <i>The Debatable Land</i> (1871).</p>

  <p class="quote">The parents had had the children's beds removed into their
bedroom, and
  strictly enjoined them not to talk of noises even if they heard them. But
  scarcely had the mother seen them safely in bed and was retiring to rest
  herself when the children cried out, "Here they are again!" The mother chid
  them, and lay down. Thereupon the noises became louder and more startling.
  The children sat up in bed. Mrs. Fox called in her husband. The night being
  windy, it suggested itself to him that it might be the rattling of the
  sashes. He tried several, shaking them to see if they were loose. Kate, the
  youngest girl, happened to remark that as often as her father shook a
  window-sash the noises seemed to reply. Being a lively child, and in a
  measure accustomed to what was going on, she turned to where the noise was,
  snapped her fingers, and called out, "Here, old Splitfoot, do as I do."
  <i>The knocking instantly responded</i>. That was the very commencement. Who
  can tell where the end will be? . Mr. Mompesson, in bed with his little
  daughter (about Kate's age) whom the sound seemed chiefly to follow,
  "observed that it would exactly answer, in drumming, anything that was beaten
  or called for." But his curiosity led him no further. Not so Kate Fox. She
  tried, by silently bringing together her thumb and forefinger, whether she
  could still obtain a response. Yes! It could see, then, as well as hear! She
  called her mother. "Only look, mother!" she said, bringing together her
  finger and thumb as before. And as often as she repeated the noiseless
  motion, just so often responded the raps.</p>

  <p>In the summer of 1848 Mr. David Fox, with the assistance of Mr. Henry
  Bush, Mr. Lyman Granger, of Rochester, and others, resumed digging in the
  cellar. At a depth of five feet they found a plank, and further digging
  disclosed charcoal and quicklime, and finally human hair and bones, which
  were pronounced by expert medical testimony to belong to a human skeleton. It
  was not until fifty-six years later that a further discovery was made which
  proved beyond all doubt that someone had really been buried in the cellar of
  the Fox house.</p>

  <p>This statement appeared in <i>The Boston Journal</i> (a non-
  Spiritualistic paper) of November 23, 1904, and runs as follows:</p>

  <p class="quote">Rochester, N.Y., Nov. 22nd, 1904: The skeleton of the man
supposed to have
  caused the rappings first heard by the Fox sisters in 1848 has been found in
  the walls of the house occupied by the sisters, and clears them from the only
  shadow of doubt held concerning their sincerity in the discovery of spirit
  communication.</p>

  <p class="quote">The Fox sisters declared they learned to communicate with
the spirit of a
  man, and that he told them he had been murdered and buried in the cellar.
  Repeated excavations failed to locate the body and thus give proof positive
  of their story.</p>

  <p class="quote">The discovery was made by school-children playing in the
cellar of the
  building in Hydesville known as the "Spook House," where the Fox sisters
  heard the wonderful rappings. William H. Hyde, a reputable citizen of Clyde,
  who owns the house, made an investigation and found an almost entire human
  skeleton between the earth and crumbling cellar walls, undoubtedly that of
  the wandering peddler who, it was claimed, was murdered in the east room of
  the house, and whose body was hidden in the cellar.</p>

  <p class="quote">Mr. Hyde has notified relatives of the Fox sisters, and the
notice of the
  discovery will be sent to the National Order of Spiritualists, many of whom
  remember having made pilgrimage to the "Spook House," as it is commonly
  called. The finding of the bones practically corroborates the sworn statement
  made by Margaret Fox, April 11, 1848.</p>

  <p>There was discovered a peddler's tin box as well as the bones, and this
  box is now preserved at Lilydale, the central country head-quarters of the
  American Spiritualists, to which also the old Hydesville house has been
  transported.</p>

  <p>These discoveries settle the question for ever and prove conclusively that
  there was a crime committed in the house, and that this crime was indicated
  by psychic means. When one examines the result of the two diggings one can
  reconstruct the circumstances. It is clear that in the first instance the
  body was buried with quicklime in the centre of the cellar. Later the
  criminal was alarmed by the fact that this place was too open to suspicion
  and he had dug up the body, or the main part of it, and reburied it under the
  wall where it would be more out of the way. The work had been done so
  hurriedly, however, or in such imperfect light, that some clear traces were
  left, as has been seen, of the original grave.</p>

  <p>Was there independent evidence of such a crime? In order to find it we
  have to turn to the deposition of Lucretia Pulver, who served as help during
  the tenancy of Mr. and Mrs. Bell, who occupied the house four years before.
  She describes how a peddler came to the house and how he stayed the night
  there with his wares. Her employers told her that she might go home that
  night.</p>

  <p class="quote">I wanted to buy some things off the peddler but had no
money with me, and
  he said he would call at our house next morning and sell them to me. I never
  saw him after this. About three days after this they sent for me to come
  back. I accordingly came back .</p>

  <p class="quote">I should think this peddler of whom I have spoken was about
thirty years
  of age. I heard him conversing with Mrs. Bell about his family. Mrs. Bell
  told me that he was an old acquaintance of theirs&mdash;that she had seen him
  several times before. One evening, about a week after this, Mrs. Bell sent me
  down to the cellar to shut the outer door. In going across the cellar I fell
  down near the centre of it. It appeared to be uneven and loose in that part.
  After I got upstairs, Mrs. Bell asked me what I screamed for and I told her.
  She laughed at me being frightened, and said it was only where the rats had
  been at work in the ground. A few days after this, Mr. Bell carried a lot of
  dirt into the cellar just at night and was at work there some time. Mrs. Bell
  told me that he was filling up the rat-holes.</p>

  <p class="quote">A short time after this Mrs. Bell gave me a thimble which
she said she had
  bought of this peddler. About three months after this I visited her and she
  said the peddler had been there again and she showed me another thimble which
  she said she had bought from him. She showed me some other things which she
  said she had bought from him.</p>

  <p>It is worth noting that a Mrs. Lape in 1847 had claimed to have actually
  <i>seen</i> an apparition in the house, and that this vision was of a middle-
sized
  man who wore grey pants, a black frock-coat and black cap. Lucretia Pulver
  deposed that the peddler in life wore a black frock-coat and light-coloured
  pants.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, it is only fair to add that the Mr. Bell who occupied
  the house at that time was not a man of notorious character, and one would
  willingly concede that an accusation founded entirely upon psychic evidence
  would be an unfair and intolerable thing. It is very different, however, when
  the proofs of a crime have actually been discovered, and the evidence then
  centres merely upon which tenant was in possession at that particular time.
  The deposition of Lucretia Pulver assumes vital importance in its bearing
  upon this matter.</p>

  <p>There are one or two points about the case which would bear discussion.
  One is that a man with so remarkable a name as Charles B. Rosma should never
  have been traced, considering all the publicity which the case acquired. This
  would certainly at the time have appeared a formidable objection, but with
  our fuller knowledge we appreciate how very difficult it is to get names
  correctly across. A name apparently is a purely conventional thing, and as
  such very different from an idea. Every practising Spiritualist has received
  messages which were correct coupled with names which were mistaken. It is
  possible that the real name was Ross, or possibly Rosmer, and that this error
  prevented identification. Again, it is curious that he should not have known
  that his body had been moved from the centre of the cellar to the wall, where
  it was eventually found. We can only record the fact without attempting to
  explain it.</p>

  <p>Again, granting that the young girls were the mediums and that the power
  was drawn from them, how came the phenomena when they had actually been
  removed from the house? To this one can only answer that though the future
  was to show that the power did actually emanate from these girls, none the
  less it seemed to have permeated the house and to have been at the disposal
  of the manifesting power for a time at least when the girls were not
  present.</p>

  <p>The Fox family were seriously troubled by the disturbances&mdash;Mrs.
  Fox's hair turned white in a week&mdash;and as it became apparent that these
  were associated with the two young daughters, these were sent from home. But
  in the house of her brother, David Fox, where Margaret went, and in that of
  her sister Leah, whose married name was Mrs. Fish, at Rochester, where
  Catharine was staying, the same sounds were heard. Every effort was made to
  conceal these manifestations from the public, but they soon became known.
  Mrs. Fish, who was a teacher of music, was unable to continue her profession,
  and hundreds of people flocked to her house to witness the new marvels. It
  should be stated that either this power was contagious, or else it was
  descending upon many individuals independently from some common source. Thus
  Mrs. Leah Fish, the elder sister, received it, though in a less degree than
  Kate or Margaret. But it was no longer confined to the Fox family. It was
  like some psychic cloud descending from on high and showing itself on those
  persons who were susceptible. Similar sounds were heard in the home of Rev.
  A. H. Jervis, a Methodist minister, living in Rochester. Strong physical
  phenomena also began in the family of Deacon Hale, of Greece, a town close to
  Rochester. A little later Mrs. Sarah A. Tamlin and Mrs. Benedict, of Auburn,
  developed remarkable mediumship. Mr. Capron, the first historian of the
  movement, describes Mrs. Tamlin as one of the most reliable mediums he had
  ever met, and says that though the sounds occurring in her presence were not
  so loud as those with the Fox family, the messages were equally
  trustworthy.</p>

  <p>It speedily became evident, then, that these unseen forces were no longer
  attached to any building, but that they had transferred themselves to the
  girls. In vain the family prayed with their Methodist friends that relief
  would come. In vain also were exorcisms performed by the clergy of various
  creeds. Beyond joining with loud raps in the Amens, the unseen presences took
  no notice of these religious exercises.</p>

  <p>The danger of blindly following alleged spirit guidance was clearly shown
  some months later in the neighbouring town of Rochester, where a man
  disappeared under suspicious circumstances. An enthusiastic Spiritualist had
  messages by raps which announced a murder. The canal was dragged and the wife
  of the missing man was actually ordered to enter the canal, which nearly cost
  her her life. Some months later the absentee returned, having fled to Canada
  to avoid a writ for debt. This, as may well be imagined, was a blow to the
  young cult. The public did not then understand what even now is so little
  understood, that death causes no change in the human spirit, that mischievous
  and humorous entities abound, and that the inquirer must use his own
  instincts and his own common sense at every turn. "Try the spirits that ye
  may know them." In the same year, in the same district, the truth of this new
  philosophy upon the one side, and its limitations and dangers on the other,
  were most clearly set forth. These dangers are with us still. The silly man,
  the arrogant inflated man, the cocksure man, is always a safe butt. Every
  observer has had some trick played upon him. The author has himself had his
  faith sorely shaken by deception until some compensating proof has come along
  to assure him that it was only a lesson which he had received, and that it
  was no more fiendish or even remarkable that disembodied intelligences should
  be hoaxers than that the same intelligence inside a human body should find
  amusement in the same foolish way.</p>

  <p>The whole course of the movement had now widened and taken a more
  important turn. It was no longer a murdered man calling for justice. The
  peddler seemed to have been used as a pioneer, and now that he had found the
  opening and the method, a myriad of Intelligences were swarming at his back.
  Isaac Post had instituted the method of spelling by raps, and messages were
  pouring through. According to these the whole system had been devised by the
  contrivance of a band of thinkers and inventors upon the spirit plane,
  foremost among whom was Benjamin Franklin, whose eager mind and electrical
  knowledge in earth life might well qualify him for such a venture. Whether
  this claim was true or not, it is a fact that Rosma dropped out of the
  picture at this stage, and that the intelligent knockings purported to be
  from the deceased friends of those inquirers who were prepared to take a
  serious interest in the matter and to gather in reverent mood to receive the
  messages. That they still lived and still loved was the constant message from
  the beyond, accompanied by many material tests, which confirmed the wavering
  faith of the new adherents of the movement. When asked for their methods of
  working and the laws which governed them, the answers were from the beginning
  exactly what they are now: that it was a matter concerned with human and
  spirit magnetism; that some who were richly endowed with this physical
  property were mediums; that this endowment was not necessarily allied to
  morality or intelligence; and that the condition of harmony was especially
  necessary to secure good results. In seventy odd years we have learned very
  little more; and after all these years the primary law of harmony is
  invariably broken at the so-called test séances, the members of which imagine
  that they have disproved the philosophy when they obtain negative or
  disordered results, whereas they have actually confirmed it.</p>

  <p>In one of the early communications the Fox sisters were assured that
  "these manifestations would not be confined to them, but would go all over
  the world." This prophecy was soon in a fair way to be fulfilled, for these
  new powers and further developments of them, which included the discerning
  and hearing of spirits and the movement of objects without contact, appeared
  in many circles which were independent of the Fox family. In an incredibly
  short space of time the movement, with many eccentricities and phases of
  fanaticism, had swept over the Northern and Eastern States of the Union,
  always retaining that solid core of actual tangible fact, which might be
  occasionally simulated by impostors, but always reasserted itself to the
  serious investigator who could shake himself free from preconceived
  prejudice. Disregarding for the moment these wider developments, let us
  continue the story of the original circles at Rochester.</p>

  <p>The spirit messages had urged upon the small band of pioneers a public
  demonstration of their powers in an open meeting at Rochester&mdash;a
  proposition which was naturally appalling to two shy country girls and to
  their friends. So incensed were the discarnate Guides by the opposition of
  their earthly agents that they threatened to suspend the whole movement for a
  generation, and did actually desert them completely for some weeks. At the
  end of that time communication was restored and the believers, chastened by
  this interval of thought, put themselves unreservedly into the hands of the
  outside forces, promising that they would dare all in the cause. It was no
  light matter. A few of the clergy, notably the Methodist minister, the Rev.
  A. H. Jervis, rallied to their aid, but the majority thundered from their
  pulpits against them, and the snob eagerly joined in the cowardly sport of
  heretic-baiting. On November 14, 1849, the Spiritualists held their first
  meeting at the Corinthian Hall, the largest available in Rochester. The
  audience, to its credit, listened with attention to the exposition of facts
  from Mr. Capron, of Auburn, the principal speaker. A committee of five
  representative citizens was then selected to examine into the matter and to
  report upon the following evening, when the meeting would reassemble. So
  certain was it that this report would be unfavourable that the <i>Rochester
  Democrat</i> is stated to have had its leading article prepared, with the
  headline: "Entire Exposure of the Rapping Humbug." The result, however,
  caused the editor to hold his hand. The committee reported that the raps were
  undoubted facts, though the information was not entirely correct, that is,
  the answers to questions were "not altogether right nor altogether wrong."
  They added that these raps came on walls and doors some distance from the
  girls, causing a sensible vibration. "They entirely failed to find any means
  by which it could be done."</p>

  <p>This report was received with disapproval by the audience, and a second
  committee from among the dissentients was formed. This investigation was con
  ducted in the office of a lawyer. Kate, for some reason, was away, and only
  Mrs. Fish and Margaret were present. None the less, the sounds continued as
  before, though a Dr. Langworthy was introduced to test the possibility of
  ventriloquism. The final report was that "the sounds were heard, and their
  thorough investigation had conclusively shown them to be produced neither by
  machinery nor ventriloquism, though what the agent is they were unable to
  determine."</p>

  <p>Again the audience turned down the report of their own committee, and
  again a deputation was chosen from among the most extreme opponents, one of
  whom vowed that if he could not find out the trick he would throw himself
  over the falls of the Genesee River. Their examination was thorough to the
  length of brutality, and a committee of ladies was associated with it. The
  latter stripped the frightened girls, who wept bitterly under their
  afflictions. Their dresses were then tied tightly round their ankles and they
  were placed upon glass and other insulators. The committee was forced to
  report, "when they were standing on pillows with a handkerchief tied round
  the bottom of their dresses, tight to the ankles, we all heard the rapping on
  the wall and floor distinctly." The committee further testified that their
  questions, some of them mental, had been answered correctly.</p>

  <p>So long as the public looked upon the movement as a sort of joke it was
  prepared to be tolerantly amused, but when these successive reports put the
  matter in a more serious light, a wave of blackguardism swept over the town,
  which reached such a pitch that Mr. Willetts, a gallant Quaker, was compelled
  at the fourth public meeting to declare that "the mob of ruffians who
  designed to lynch the girls should do so, if they attempted it, over his dead
  body." There was a disgraceful riot, the young women were smuggled out by a
  back door, and reason and justice were for the moment clouded over by force
  and folly. Then, as now, the minds of the average men of the world were so
  crammed with the things that do not matter that they had no space for the
  things that do matter. But Fate is never in a hurry, and the movement went
  on. Many accepted the findings of the successive committees as being final,
  and indeed, it is difficult to see how the alleged facts could have been more
  severely tested. At the same time, this strong, new, fermenting wine began to
  burst some of the old bottles into which it was poured to the excusable
  disgust of the public.</p>

  <p>The many discreet, serious and religious circles were for a season almost
  obscured by swollen-headed ranters who imagined themselves to be in touch
  with every high entity from the Apostles downwards, some even claiming the
  direct afflatus of the Holy Ghost and emitting messages which were only saved
  from being blasphemous by their crudity and absurdity. One community of these
  fanatics, who called themselves the Apostolic Circle of Mountain Cove,
  particularly distinguished themselves by their extreme claims and furnished
  good material for the enemies of the new dispensation. The great body of
  Spiritualists turned away in disapproval from such exaggerations, but were
  unable to prevent them. Many well-attested supernormal phenomena came to
  support the failing spirits of those who were distressed by the so excesses
  of the fanatics. On one occasion, which is particularly convincing and
  well-reported, two bodies of investigators in separate rooms, at Rochester,
  on February 20, 1850, received the same message simultaneously from some
  central force which called itself Benjamin Franklin. This double message was:
  "There will be great changes in the nineteenth century. Things that now look
  dark and mysterious to you will be laid plain before your sight. Mysteries
  are going to be revealed. The world will be en lightened." It must be
  admitted that, up to now, the prophecy has been only partially fulfilled, and
  it may at the same time be conceded that, with some startling exceptions, the
  forecasts of the spirit people have not been remarkable for accuracy,
  especially where the element of time is concerned.</p>

  <p>The question has often been asked: "What was the purpose of so strange a
  movement at this particular time, granting that it is all that it claims to
  be?" Governor Tallmadge, a United States senator of repute, was one of the
  early converts to the new cult, and he has left it upon record that he asked
  this question upon two separate occasions in two different years from
  different mediums. The answer in each case was almost identical. The first
  said: "It is to draw mankind together in harmony, and to convince sceptics of
  the immortality of the soul." The second said: "To unite mankind and to
  convince sceptical minds of the immortality of the soul." Surely this is no
  ignoble ambition and does not justify those narrow and bitter attacks from
  ministers and the less progressive of their flocks from which Spiritualists
  have up to the present day had to suffer. The first half of the definition is
  particularly important, for it is possible that one of the ultimate results
  of this movement will be to unite religion upon a common basis so strong,
  and, indeed, so self-sufficient, that the quibbles which separate the
  Churches of to-day will be seen in their true proportions and will be swept
  away or disregarded. One could even hope that such a movement might spread
  beyond the bounds of Christianity and throw down some of the barriers which
  stand between great sections of the human race.</p>

  <p>Attempts to expose the phenomena were made from time to time. In February,
  1851, Dr. Austin Flint, Dr. Charles A. Lee, and Dr. C. B. Coventry of the
  University of Buffalo, published a statement [Capron "Modern Spiritualism,
  etc.," pp. 310-31.] showing to their own satisfaction that the sounds
  occurring in the presence of the Fox sisters were caused by the snapping of
  knee joints. It called forth a characteristic reply in the Press from Mrs.
  Fish and Margaret Fox, addressed to the three doctors:</p>

  <p class="quote">As we do not feel willing to rest under the imputation of
being impostors,
  we are very willing to undergo a proper and decent examination, provided we
  can select three male and three female friends who shall be present on the
  occasion. We can assure the public that there is no one more anxious than
  ourselves to discover the origin of these mysterious manifestations. If they
  can be explained on "anatomical" or "physiological" principles, it is due to
  the world that the investigation be made, and that the "humbug" be exposed.
  As there seems to be much interest manifested by the public on that subject,
  we would suggest that as early an investigation as is convenient would be
  acceptable to the undersigned.</p>

  <p class="quote">Ann L. Fish. Margaretta Fox.</p>

  <p>The investigation was held, but the results were negative. In an appended
  note to the doctors' report in the <i>New York Tribune</i>, the editor
  (Horace Greeley) observes:</p>

  <p class="quote">The doctors, as has already appeared in our columns,
commenced with the
  assumption that the origin of the "rapping" sounds <i>must</i> be physical,
and
  their primary cause the volition of the ladies aforesaid&mdash;in short, that
  these ladies were "The Rochester impostors." They appear, therefore, in the
  above statement, as the prosecutors of an impeachment, and ought to have
  selected other persons as judges and reporters of the trial . It is quite
  probable that we shall have another version of the matter.</p>

  <p>Much testimony in support of the Fox sisters was quickly forthcoming, and
  the only effect of the professors' "exposure" was to redouble the public
  interest in the manifestations.</p>

  <p>There was also the alleged confession of Mrs. Norman Culver, who deposed,
  on April 17, 1851, that Catharine Fox had revealed to her the whole secret of
  how the raps were produced. It was an entire fabrication, and Mr. Capron
  published a crushing answer, showing that on the date when Catharine Fox was
  supposed to have made the confession to Mrs. Culver, she was residing at his
  house seventy miles distant.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Fox and her three daughters began public sittings in New York in the
  spring of 1850, at Barnum's Hotel, and they attracted many curious visitors.
  The Press was almost unanimous in denunciation of them. A brilliant exception
  to this was found in Horace Greeley, already quoted, who wrote an
  appreciative article in his paper under his own initials. A portion of this
  will be found in the Appendix.</p>

  <p>After a return to Rochester, the Fox family made a tour of the Western
  States, and then paid a second visit to New York, when the same intense
  public interest was displayed. They had obeyed the spirits' mandate to
  proclaim these truths to the world, and the new era that had been announced
  was now ushered in. When one reads the detailed accounts of some of these
  American sittings, and considers the brain power of the sitters, it is
  amazing to think that people, blinded by prejudice, should be so credulous as
  to imagine that it was all the result of deception. At that time was shown
  moral courage which has been conspicuously lacking since the reactionary
  forces in science and in religion combined to stifle the new knowledge and to
  make it dangerous for its professors. Thus in a single sitting in New York in
  1850 we find that there were gathered round the table the Rev. Dr. Griswold,
  Fenimore Cooper the novelist, Bancroft the historian, Rev. Dr. Hawks, Dr. J.
  W. Francis, Dr. Marcy, Willis the Quaker poet, Bryant the poet, Bigelow of
  <i>The Evening Post</i>, and General Lyman. All of these were satisfied as to
  the facts, and the account winds up "The manners and bearing of the ladies"
  (I.E. the three Fox sisters) "are such as to create a prepossession in their
  favour." The world since then has dug up much coal and iron; it has erected
  great structures and it has invented terrible engines of war, but can we say
  that it has advanced in spiritual knowledge or reverence for the unseen?
  Under the guidance of materialism the wrong path has been followed, and it
  becomes increasingly clear that the people must return or perish.</p>

    Fox-Kane.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p class="first">FOR the sake of continuity the subsequent history of the Fox
  sisters will now be given after the events at Hydesville. It is a remarkable,
  and to Spiritualists a painful, story, but it bears its own lesson and should
  be faithfully recorded. When men have an honest and whole-hearted aspiration
  for truth there is no development which can ever leave them abashed or find
  no place in their scheme.</p>

  <p>For some years the two younger sisters, Kate and Margaret, gave séances at
  New York and other places, successfully meeting every test which was applied
  to them. Horace Greeley, afterwards a candidate for the United States
  presidency, was, as already shown, deeply interested in them and convinced of
  their entire honesty. He is said to have furnished the funds by which the
  younger girl completed her very imperfect education.</p>

  <p>During these years of public mediumship, when the girls were all the rage
  among those who had no conception of the religious significance of this new
  revelation, and who concerned themselves with it purely in the hope of
  worldly advantage, the sisters exposed themselves to the enervating
  influences of promiscuous séances in a way which no earnest Spiritualist
  could justify. The dangers of such practices were not then so clearly
  realized as now, nor had it occurred to people that it is unlikely that high
  spirits would descend to earth in order to advise as to the state of railway
  stocks or the issue of love affairs. The ignorance was universal, and there
  was no wise mentor at the elbow of these poor pioneers to point the higher
  and the safer path. Worst of all, their jaded energies were renewed by the
  offer of wine at a time when one at least of them was hardly more than a
  child. It is said that there was some family predisposition towards
  alcoholism, but even without such a taint their whole procedure and mode of
  life were rash to the last degree. Against their moral character there has
  never been a breath of suspicion, but they had taken a road which leads to
  degeneration of mind and character, though it was many years before the more
  serious effects were manifest.</p>

  <p>Some idea of the pressure upon the Fox girls at this time may be gathered
  from Mrs. Hardinge Britten's* description from her own observation. She talks
  of "pausing on the first floor to hear poor patient Kate Fox, in the midst of
  a captious, grumbling crowd of investigators, repeating hour after hour the
  letters of the alphabet, while the no less poor, patient spirits rapped out
  names, ages and dates to suit all comers." Can one wonder that the girls,
  with vitality sapped, the beautiful, watchful influence of the mother
  removed, and harassed by enemies, succumbed to a gradually increasing
  temptation in the direction of stimulants?</p>

  <p class="footnote">* <i>Autobiography</i>, p. 40.</p>

  <p>A remarkably clear light is thrown upon Margaret at this period in that
  curious booklet, "The Love Letters of Dr. Elisha Kane." It was in 1852 that
  Dr. Kane, afterwards the famous Arctic explorer, met Margaret Fox, who was a
  beautiful and attractive girl. To her Kane wrote those love letters which
  record one of the most curious courtships in literature. Elisha Kane, as his
  first name might imply, was a man of Puritan extraction, and Puritans, with
  their belief that the Bible represents the absolutely final word in spiritual
  inspiration and that they understand what that last word means, are
  instinctively antagonistic to a new cult which professes to show that new
  sources and new interpretations are still available.</p>

  <p>He was also a doctor of medicine, and the medical profession is at the
  same time the most noble and the most cynically incredulous in the world.
  From the first Kane made up his mind that the young girl was involved in
  fraud, and formed the theory that her elder sister Leah was, for purposes of
  gain, exploiting the fraud. The fact that Leah shortly afterwards married a
  wealthy man named Underhill, a Wall Street insurance magnate, does not appear
  to have modified Kane's views as to her greed for illicit earnings. The
  doctor formed a close friendship with Margaret, put her under his own aunt
  for purposes of education whilst he was away in the Arctic, and finally
  married her under the curious Gretna Green kind of marriage law which seems
  to have prevailed at the time. Shortly afterwards he died (in 1857), and the
  widow, now calling herself Mrs. Fox-Kane, forswore all phenomena for a time,
  and was received into the Roman Catholic Church.</p>

  <p>In these letters Kane continually reproaches Margaret with living in
  deceit and hypocrisy. We have very few of her letters, so that we do not know
  how far she defended herself. The compiler of the book, though a non-
  Spiritualist, says: "Poor girl, with her simplicity, ingenuousness and
  timidity, she could not, had she been so inclined, have practised the
  slightest deception with any chance of success." This testimony is valuable,
  as the writer was clearly intimately acquainted with everyone concerned. Kane
  himself, writing to the younger sister Kate, says: "Take my advice and never
  talk of the spirits either to friends or strangers. You know that with all my
  intimacy with Maggie after a whole month's trial I could make nothing of
  them. Therefore they are a great mystery."</p>

  <p>Considering their close relations, and that Margaret clearly gave Kane
  every demonstration of her powers, it is inconceivable that a trained medical
  man would have to admit after a month that he could make nothing of it, if it
  were indeed a mere cracking of a joint. One can find no evidence for fraud in
  these letters, but one does find ample proof that these two young girls,
  Margaret and Kate, had not the least idea of the religious implications
  involved in these powers, or of the grave responsibilities of mediumship, and
  that they misused their gift in the direction of giving worldly advice,
  receiving promiscuous sitters, and answering comic or frivolous questions. If
  in such circumstances both their powers and their character were to
  deteriorate, it would not surprise any experienced Spiritualist. They
  deserved no better, though their age and ignorance furnished an excuse.</p>

  <p>To realize their position one has to remember that they were little more
  than children, poorly educated, and quite ignorant of the philosophy of the
  subject. When a man like Dr. Kane assured Margaret that it was very wrong, he
  was only saying what was dinned into her ears from every quarter, including
  half the pulpits of New York. Probably she had an uneasy feeling that it was
  wrong, without in the least knowing why, and this may account for the fact
  that she does not seem to remonstrate with him for his suspicions. Indeed, we
  may admit that <i>au fond</i> Kane was right, and that the proceedings were
  in some ways unjustifiable. At that time they were very unvenal themselves,
  and had they used their gift, as D.D. Home used his, with no relation to
  worldly things, and for the purpose only of proving immortality and consoling
  the afflicted, then, indeed, they would have been above criticism. He was
  wrong in doubting their gift, but right in looking askance at some examples
  of their use of it.</p>

  <p>In some ways Kane's position is hopelessly illogical. He was on most
  intimate and affectionate terms with the mother and the two girls, although
  if words have any meaning he thought them to be swindlers living on the
  credulity of the public. "Kiss Katie for me," he says, and he continually
  sends love to the mother. Already, young as they were, he had a glimpse of
  the alcoholic danger to which they were exposed by late hours and promiscuous
  company. "Tell Katie to drink no champagne, and do you follow the same
  advice," said he. It was sound counsel, and it would have been well for
  themselves and for the movement if they had both followed it; but again we
  must remember their inexperienced youth and the constant temptations.</p>

  <p>Kane was a curious blend of the hero and the prig. Spirit-rapping,
  unfortified by any of the religious or scientific sanctions which came later,
  was a low-down thing, a superstition of the illiterate, and was he, a man of
  repute, to marry a spirit-rapper? He vacillated over it in an extraordinary
  way, beginning a letter with claims to be her brother, and ending by
  reminding her of the warmth of his kisses. "Now that you have given me your
  heart, I will be a brother to you," he says. He had a vein of real
  superstition running through him which was far below the credulity which he
  ascribed to others. He frequently alludes to the fact that by raising his
  right hand he had powers of divination and that he had learned it "from a
  conjurer in the Indies." Occasionally he is a snob as well as a prig. "At the
  very dinner-table of the President I thought of you"; and again: "You could
  never lift yourself up to my thoughts and my objects. I could never bring
  myself down to yours." As a matter of fact, the few extracts given from her
  letters show an intelligent and sympathetic mind. On at least one occasion we
  find Kane suggesting deceit to her, and she combating the idea.</p>

  <p>There are four fixed points which can be established by the letters:</p>

  <p>1. That Kane thought in a vague way that there was trickery; 2. That in
  the years of their close intimacy she never admitted it; 3. That he could not
  even suggest in what the trickery lay; 4. That she did use her powers in a
  way which serious Spiritualists would deplore.</p>

  <p>She really knew no more of the nature of these forces than those around
  her did. The editor says: "She had always averred that she never fully
  believed the rappings to be the work of spirits, but imagined some occult
  laws of nature were concerned." This was her attitude later in life, for on
  her professional card she printed that people must judge the nature of the
  powers for themselves.</p>

  <p>It is natural that those who speak of the danger of mediumship, and
  especially of physical mediumship, should point to the Fox sisters as an
  example. But their case must not be exaggerated. In the year 1871, after more
  than twenty years of this exhausting work, we find them still receiving the
  enthusiastic support and admiration of many leading men and women of the day.
  It was only after forty years of public service that adverse conditions were
  manifested in their lives, and therefore, without in any way glossing over
  what is evil, we can fairly claim that their record hardly justifies those
  who allude to mediumship as a soul-destroying profession.</p>

  <p>It was in this year 1871 that Kate Fox's visit to England was brought
  about through the generosity of Mr. Charles F. Livermore, a prominent banker
  of New York, in gratitude for the consolation he had received from her
  wonderful powers, and to advance the cause of Spiritualism. He provided for
  all her needs, and thus removed any necessity for her to give professional
  sittings. He also arranged for her to be accompanied by a congenial woman
  companion.</p>

  <p>In a letter [<i>The Spiritual Magazine</i>, 1871, pp. 525-6.] to Mr.
  Benjamin Coleman, a well-known worker in the Spiritualist movement, Mr.
  Livermore says:</p>

  <p class="quote">Miss Fox, taken all in all, is no doubt the most wonderful
living medium.
  Her character is irreproachable and pure. I have received so much through her
  powers of mediumship during the past ten years which is solacing, instructive
  and astounding, that I feel greatly indebted to her, and desire to have her
  taken good care of while absent from her home and friends.</p>

  <p>His further remarks have some bearing possibly on the later sad events of
  her life:</p>

  <p class="quote">That you may the more thoroughly understand her
idiosyncrasies, permit me
  to explain that she is a sensitive of the highest order and of childlike
  simplicity; she feels keenly the atmospheres of everyone with whom she is
  brought in contact, and to that degree that at times she becomes exceedingly
  nervous and apparently capricious.</p>

  <p class="quote">For this reason I have advised her not to sit in dark
séances, that she
  may avoid the irritation arising from the suspicion of sceptics, mere
  curiosity-mongers, and lovers of the marvellous.</p>

  <p class="quote">The perfection of the manifestations to be obtained through
her depends
  upon her surroundings, and in proportion as she is in rapport or sympathy
  with you does she seem receptive of spiritual power. The communications
  through her are very remarkable, and have come to me frequently from my wife
  (Estelle), in perfect idiomatic French, and sometimes in Spanish and Italian,
  whilst she herself is not acquainted with any of these languages. You will
  understand all this, but these explanations may be necessary for others. As I
  have said, <i>she will not give séances as a professional medium</i>, but I
  hope she will do all the good she can in furtherance of the great truth, in a
  quiet way, while she remains in England.</p>

  <p>Mr. Coleman, who had a sitting with her in New York, says that he received
  one of the most striking evidences of spirit identity that had ever occurred
  to him in his experience of seventeen years. Mr. Cromwell F. Varley, the
  electrician who laid the Atlantic cable, in his evidence before the London
  Dialectical Society in 1869, spoke of interesting electrical experiments he
  made with this medium.</p>

  <p>The visit of Kate Fox to England was evidently regarded as a mission, for
  we find Mr. Coleman advising her to choose only those sitters who are not
  afraid to have their names published in confirmation of the facts they have
  witnessed. This course seems to have been adopted to some extent, for there
  is preserved a fair amount of testimony to her powers from, among others,
  Professor William Crookes, Mr. S. C. Hall, Mr. W. H. Harrison (editor of
  <i>The Spiritualist</i>), Miss Rosamund Dale Owen (who afterwards married
  Laurence Oliphant), and the Rev. John Page Hopps.</p>

  <p>The new-comer began to hold sittings soon after her arrival. At one of the
  first of these, on November 24, 1871, a representative of <i>The Times</i>
  was present, and he published a detailed account of the séance, which was
  held jointly with D.D. Home, a close friend of the medium. This appeared in
  an article entitled "Spiritualism and Science," occupying three and a half
  columns of leading type. <i>The Times</i> Commissioner speaks of Miss Fox
  taking him to the door of the room and inviting him to stand by her and to
  hold her hands, which he did, "when loud thumps seemed to come from the
  panels, as if done with the fist. These were repeated at our request any
  number of times." He mentioned that he tried every test that he could think
  of, that Miss Fox and Mr. Home gave every opportunity for examination, and
  that their feet and hands were held.</p>

  <p>In the course of a leading article on the above report and the
  correspondence that came from it, <i>The Times</i> (January 6, 1873) declared
  that there was no case for scientific inquiry:</p>

  <p class="quote">Many sensible readers, we fear, will think we owe them an
apology for
  opening our columns to a controversy on such a subject as Spiritualism and
  thus treating as an open or debatable question what should rather be
  dismissed at once as either an imposture or a delusion. But even an imposture
  may call for unmasking, and popular delusions however-absurd, are often too
  important to be neglected by the wiser portion of mankind . Is there, in
  reality, anything, as lawyers would say, to go to a jury with? Well, on the
  one hand, we have abundance of alleged experience which can hardly be called
  evidence, and a few depositions of a more notable and impressive character.
  On the other hand, we have many accounts of convicted impostors, and many
  authentic reports of precisely such disappointments or discoveries as we
  should be led to expect.</p>

  <p>On December 14, 1872, Miss Fox married Mr. H. D. Jencken, a London
  barrister-at-law, author of "A Compendium of Modern Roman Law," etc., and
  honorary general secretary of the Association for the Reform and Codification
  of the Law of Nations. He was one of the earliest Spiritualists in
  England.</p>

  <p><i>The Spiritualist</i>, in its account of the ceremony, says that the
  spirit people took part in the proceedings, for at the wedding breakfast loud
  raps were heard coming from various parts of the room, and the large table on
  which stood the wedding-cake was repeatedly raised from the floor.</p>

  <p>A contemporary witness states that Mrs. Kate Fox-Jencken (as she came to
  be known) and her husband were to be met in the early 'seventies in good
  social circles in London. Her services were eagerly sought after by
  investigators.</p>

  <p>John Page Hopps describes her at this time as "a small, thin, very
  intelligent, but rather simpering little woman, with nice, gentle manners and
  a quiet enjoyment of her experiments which entirely saved her from the
  slightest touch of self-importance or affectation of mystery."</p>

  <p>Her mediumship consisted chiefly of raps (often of great power), spirit
  lights, direct writing, and the appearance of materialized hands. Full form
  materializations, which had been an occasional feature of her sittings in
  America, were rare with her in England. On a number of occasions objects in
  the séance-room were moved by spirit agency, and in some cases brought from
  another room.</p>

  <p>It was about this time that Professor William Crookes conducted his
  inquiries into the medium's powers, and issued that whole-hearted report
  which is dealt with later when Crookes's early connexion with Spiritualism
  comes to be discussed. These careful observations show that the rappings
  constituted only a small part of Kate Fox's psychic powers, and that if they
  could be adequately explained by normal means they would still leave us amid
  mysteries. Thus Crookes recounts how, when the only people present besides
  himself and Miss Fox were his wife and a lady relative "I was holding the
  medium's two hands in one of mine, while her feet were resting on my feet.
  Paper was on the table before us, and my disengaged hand was holding a
  pencil.</p>

  <p>"A luminous hand came down from the upper part of the room, and after
  hovering near me for a few seconds, took the pencil from my hand, rapidly
  wrote on a sheet of paper, threw the pencil down, and then rose over our
  heads, gradually fading into darkness.</p>

  <p>Many other observers describe similar phenomena with this medium on
  various occasions.</p>

  <p>A very extraordinary phase of Mrs. Fox-Jensen's mediumship was the
  production of luminous substances. In the presence of Mrs. Makdougall
  Gregory, Mr. W. H. Harrison, the editor of a London newspaper, and others, a
  hand appeared carrying some phosphorescent material, about four inches
  square, with which the floor was struck and a sitter's face touched.* The
  light proved to be cold. Miss Rosamund Dale Owen, in her account of this
  phenomenon, describes the objects as "illumined crystals," and says that she
  has seen no materialization which gave so realistic a feeling of spirit
  nearness as did these graceful lights. The author can also corroborate the
  fact that these lights are usually cold, as on one occasion, with another
  medium, such a light settled for some seconds upon his face. Miss Owen also
  speaks of books and small ornaments being carried about, and a heavy musical
  box, weighing about twenty-five pounds, being brought from a side-table. A
  peculiarity of this instrument was that it had been out of order for months
  and could not be used until the unseen forces repaired it and wound it
  themselves.</p>

  <p class="footnote">* <i>The Spiritualist</i>, Vol. VIII, p. 299.
  <i>Light</i>, 1884, p. 170.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Jencken's mediumship was interwoven in the texture of her daily life.
  Professor Butlerof says that when he paid a morning social call on her and
  her husband in company with M. Aksakof he heard raps upon the floor. Spending
  an evening at the Jenckens' house, he reports that raps were numerous during
  tea. Miss Rosamund Dale Owen also refers* to the incident of the medium
  standing in the street at a shop window with two ladies, when raps joined in
  the conversation, the pavement vibrating under their feet. The raps are
  described as having been loud enough to attract the attention of passers by.
  Mr. Jencken relates many cases of spontaneous phenomena in their home
  life.</p>

  <p class="footnote">* <i>Light</i>, 1884, p. 39. <i>The Spiritualist</i>, IV,
  p. 138, and VII, p. 66. <i>Light</i>, 1882, pp. 439-40.</p>

  <p>A volume could be filled with details of the séances of this medium, but
  with the exception of one further record we must be content with agreeing
  with the dictum of Professor Butlerof, of the University of St. Petersburg,
  who, after investigating her powers in London, wrote in <i>The
  Spiritualist</i> (February 4, 1876):</p>

  <p class="quote">From all that I was able to observe in the presence of Mrs.
Jencken, I am
  forced to come to the conclusion that the phenomena peculiar to that medium
  are of a strongly objective and convincing nature, and they would, I think,
  be sufficient for the most pronounced but <i>Honest</i> sceptic to cause him
  to reject ventriloquism, muscular action, and every such artificial
  explanation of the phenomena.</p>

  <p>Mr. H. D. Jencken died in 1881, and his widow was left with two sons.
  These children showed wonderful mediumship at a very early age, particulars
  of which will be found in contemporary records.</p>

  <p>Mr. S. C. Hall, a well-known literary man and a.prominent Spiritualist,
  describes a sitting at his house in Kensington on his birthday, May 9, 1882,
  at which his deceased wife manifested her presence:</p>

  <p class="quote">Many interesting and touching messages were conveyed to me
by the usual
  writing of Mrs. Jencken. We were directed to put out the light. Then
  commenced a series of manifestations such as I have not often seen equalled,
  and very seldom surpassed . I removed a small handbell from the table and
  held it in my own hand. I felt a hand take it from me, when it was rung in
  all parts of the room during at least five minutes. I then placed an
  accordion under the table, whence it was removed, and at a distance of three
  or four feet from the table round which we were seated, tunes were played.
  The accordion was played and the bell was rung in several parts of the room,
  while two candles were lit on the table. It was not, therefore, what is
  termed a dark sitting, although occasionally the lights were put out. During
  all the time Mr. Stack held one of the hands of Mrs. Jencken and I held the
  other&mdash;each frequently saying, "I have Mrs. Jencken's hand in mine."</p>

  <p class="quote">About fifty flowers of heartsease were placed on a sheet of
paper before
  me. I had received some heartsease flowers from a friend in the morning, but
  the vase that contained them was not in the sitting-room. I sent for it and
  found it intact. The bouquet had not been in the least disturbed. In what is
  called "Direct Writing" I found these words written in pencil in a very small
  hand, on a sheet of paper that lay before me, "I have brought you my token of
  love." At a sitting some days previously (when alone with Mrs. Jencken) I had
  received this message, "On your birthday I will bring you a token of
  love."</p>

  <p>Mr. Hall adds that he had marked the sheet of paper with his initials,
  and, as an extra precaution, had torn off one of the corners in such a manner
  as to ensure recognition.</p>

  <p>It is evident that Mr. Hall was greatly impressed by what he had seen. He
  writes: "I have witnessed and recorded many wonderful manifestations; I doubt
  if I have seen any more convincing than this; certainly none more refined;
  none that gave more conclusive evidence that pure and good and holy spirits
  alone were communicating." He states that he has consented to become Mrs.
  Jencken's "banker," presumably for funds for the education of her two boys.
  In view of what afterwards happened to this gifted medium, there is a sad
  interest in his concluding words:</p>

  <p class="quote">I feel confidence approaching certainty that, in all
respects, she will so
  act as to increase and not lessen her power as a medium while retaining the
  friendship and trust of the many who cannot but feel for her a regard in some
  degree resembling (as arising from the same source) that which the New Church
  accords to Emanuel Swedenborg, and the Methodists render to John Wesley.
  Assuredly Spiritualists owe to this lady a huge debt for the glad tidings she
  was largely the instrument, selected by Providence, to convey to them.</p>

  <p>We have given this account in some detail because it shows that the gifts
  of the medium were at this time of a high and powerful order. A few years
  earlier, at a séance at her house on December 14, 1873, on the occasion of
  the first anniversary of her wedding, a spirit message was rapped out: "When
  shadows fall upon you, think of the brighter side." It was a prophetic
  message, for the end of her life was all shadows.</p>

  <p>Margaret (Mrs. Fox-Kane) had joined her sister Kate in England in 1876,
  and they remained together for some years until the very painful incident
  occurred which has now to be discussed. It would appear that a very bitter
  quarrel broke out between the elder sister Leah (now Mrs. Underhill) and the
  two younger ones. It is probable that Leah may have heard that there was now
  a tendency to alcoholism, and may have interfered with more energy than tact.
  Some Spiritualists interfered also, and incurred the fury of the two sisters
  by some suggestion that Kate's children should be separated from her.</p>

  <p>Looking round for some weapon&mdash;any weapon&mdash;with which they could
  injure those whom they so bitterly hated, it seems to have occurred to
  them&mdash;or, according to their subsequent statement, to have been
  suggested to them, with promises of pecuniary reward&mdash;that if they
  injured the whole cult by an admission of fraud they would wound Leah and her
  associates in their most sensitive part. On the top of alcoholic excitement
  and the frenzy of hatred there was added religious fanaticism, for Margaret
  had been lectured by some of the leading spirits of the Church of Rome and
  persuaded, as Home had been also for a short time, that her own powers were
  evil. She mentions Cardinal Manning as having influenced her mind in this
  way, but her statements are not to be taken too seriously. At any rate, all
  these causes combined and reduced her to a state which was perilously near
  madness. Before leaving London she had written to <i>The New York Herald</i>
  denouncing the cult, but stating in one sentence that the rappings were "the
  only part of the phenomena that is worthy of notice." On reaching New York,
  where, according to her own subsequent statement, she was to receive a sum of
  money for the newspaper sensation which she promised to produce, she broke
  out into absolute raving against her elder sister.</p>

  <p>It is a curious psychological study, and equally curious is the mental
  attitude of the people who could imagine that the assertions of an unbalanced
  woman, acting not only from motives of hatred but also from&mdash;as she
  herself stated&mdash;the hope of pecuniary reward, could upset the critical
  investigation of a generation of observers.</p>

  <p>None the less, we have to face the fact that she did actually produce
  rappings, or enable raps to be produced, at a subsequent meeting in the New
  York Academy of Music. This might be discounted upon the grounds that in so
  large a hall any prearranged sound might be attributed to the medium. More
  important is the evidence of the reporter of the Herald, who had a previous
  private performance. He describes it thus:</p>

  <p class="quote">I heard first a rapping under the floor near my feet, then
under the chair
  in which I was seated, and again under a table on which I was leaning. She
  led me to the door and I heard the same sound on the other side of it. Then
  when she sat down on the piano stool the instrument reverberated more loudly
  and the tap-tap resounded throughout its hollow structure.</p>

  <p>This account makes it clear that she had the noises under control, though
  the reporter must have been more unsophisticated than most pressmen of my
  acquaintance, if he could believe that sounds varying both in quality and in
  position all came from some click within the medium's foot. He clearly did
  not know how the sounds came, and it is the author's opinion that Margaret
  did not know either. That she really had something which she could exhibit is
  proved, not only by the experience of the reporter but by that of Mr.
  Wedgwood, a London Spiritualist, to whom she gave a demonstration before she
  started for America. It is vain, therefore, to contend that there was no
  basis at all in Margaret's exposure. What that basis was we must endeavour to
  define.</p>

  <p>The Margaret Fox-Kane sensation was in August and September, 1888 &mdash;
  a welcome boon for the enterprising paper which had exploited it. In October
  Kate came over to join forces with her sister. It should be explained that
  the real quarrel, so far as is known, was between Kate and Leah, for Leah had
  endeavoured to get Kate's children taken from her on the grounds that the
  mother's influence was not for good. Therefore, though Kate did not rave, and
  though she volunteered no exposures in public or private, she was quite at
  one with her sister in the general plot to "down" Leah at all costs.</p>

  <p class="quote">She was the one who caused my arrest last spring (she said)
and the
  bringing of the preposterous charge that I was cruel to my children. I don't
  know why it is she has always been jealous of Maggie and me; I suppose
  because we could do things in Spiritualism that she couldn't.</p>

  <p class="quote">She was present at the Hall of Music meeting on October 21,
when Margaret
  made her repudiation and produced the raps. She was silent on that occasion,
  but that silence may be taken as a support of the statements to which she
  listened.</p>

  <p>If this were indeed so, and if she spoke as reported to the interviewer,
  her repentance must have come very rapidly. Upon November 17, less than a
  month after the famous meeting, she wrote to a lady in London, Mrs. Cottell,
  who was the tenant of Carlyle's old house, this remarkable letter from New
  York (<i>Light</i>, 1888, p. 619):</p>

  <p class="quote">I would have written to you before this but my surprise was
so great on my
  arrival to hear of Maggie's exposure of Spiritualism that I had no heart to
  write to anyone.</p>

  <p class="quote">The manager of the affair engaged the Academy of Music, the
very largest
  place of entertainment in New York City; it was filled to overflowing.</p>

  <p class="quote">They made fifteen hundred dollars clear. I have often
wished I had
  remained with you, and if I had the means I would now return to get out of
  all this.</p>

  <p class="quote">I think now I could make money in proving that the
knockings are not made
  with the toes. So many people come to me to ask me about this exposure of
  Maggie's that I have to deny myself to them.</p>

  <p class="quote">They are hard at work to expose the whole thing if they
can; but they
  certainly cannot.</p>

  <p class="quote">Maggie is giving public exposures in all the large places
in America, but
  I have only seen her once since I arrived.</p>

  <p>This letter of Kate's points to pecuniary temptation as playing a large
  part in the transaction. Maggie, however, seems to have soon found that there
  was little money in it, and could see no profit in telling lies for which she
  was not paid, and which had only proved that the Spiritualistic movement was
  so firmly established that it was quite unruffled by her treachery. For this
  or other reasons&mdash;let us hope with some final twinges of conscience as
  to the part she had played&mdash;she now admitted that she had been telling
  falsehoods from the lowest motives. The interview was reported in the New
  York Press, November 20, 1889, about a year after the onslaught.</p>

  <p>"Would to God," she said, in a voice that trembled with intense
  excitement, "that I could undo the injustice I did the cause of Spiritualism
  when, under the strong psychological influence of persons inimical to it, I
  gave expression to utterances that had no foundation in fact. This retraction
  and denial has not come about so much from my own sense of what is right as
  from the silent impulse of the spirits using my organism at the expense of
  the hostility of the treacherous horde who held out promises of wealth and
  happiness in return for an attack on Spiritualism, and whose hopeful
  assurances were so deceitful .</p>

  <p>"Long before I spoke to any person on this matter, I was unceasingly
  reminded by my spirit control what I should do, and at last I have come to
  the conclusion that it would be useless for me further to thwart their
  promptings ."</p>

  <p>"Has there been no mention of a monetary consideration for this
  statement?"</p>

  <p>"Not the smallest; none whatever."</p>

  <p>"Then financial gain is not the end which you are looking to?"</p>

  <p>"Indirectly, yes. You know that even a mortal instrument in the hands of
  the spirit must have the maintenance of life. This I propose to derive from
  my lectures. Not one cent has passed to me from any person because I adopted
  this course."</p>

  <p>"What cause led up to your exposure of the spirit rappings?"</p>

  <p>"At that time I was in great need of money, and persons&mdash;who for the
  present I prefer not to name&mdash;took advantage of the situation; hence the
  trouble. The excitement, too, helped to upset my mental equilibrium."</p>

  <p>"What was the object of the persons who induced you to make the confession
  that you and all other mediums traded on the credulity of people?"</p>

  <p>"They had several objects in view. Their first and paramount idea was to
  crush Spiritualism, to make money for themselves, and to get up a great
  excitement, as that was an element in which they flourish."</p>

  <p>"Was there any truth in the charges you made against Spiritualism?"</p>

  <p>"Those charges were false in every particular. I have no hesitation in
  saying that ."</p>

  <p>"No, my belief in Spiritualism has undergone no change. When I made those
  dreadful statements I was not responsible for my words. Its genuineness is an
  incontrovertible fact. Not all the Herrmans that ever breathed can duplicate
  the wonders that are produced through some mediums. By deftness of fingers
  and smartness of wits they may produce writing on papers and slates, but even
  this cannot bear close investigation. Materialization is beyond their mental
  calibre to reproduce, and I challenge anyone to make the 'rap' under the same
  conditions which I will. There is not a human being on earth can produce the
  'raps' in the same way as they are through me."</p>

  <p>"Do you propose to hold séances?"</p>

  <p>"No, I will devote myself entirely to platform work, as that will find me
  a better opportunity to refute the foul slanders uttered by me against
  Spiritualism."</p>

  <p>"What does your sister Kate say of your present course?"</p>

  <p>"She is in complete sympathy with me. She did not approve my course in the
  past ."</p>

  <p>"Will you have a manager for your lecture tour?" "No, sir. I have a horror
  of them. They, too, treated me most outrageously. Frank Stechen acted
  shamefully with me. He made considerable money through his management for me,
  and left me in Boston without a cent. All I got from him was five hundred and
  fifty dollars, which was given to me at the beginning of the contract."</p>

  <p>To give greater authenticity to the interview, at her suggestion the
  following open letter was written to which she placed her signature:</p>

  <p class="quote">128, West Forty-third Street, New York City,<br>
  <i>November</i> 16, 1889.</p>

  <p class="quote">TO THE PUBLIC.</p>

  <p class="quote">The foregoing interview having been read over to me I find
nothing
  contained therein that is not a correct record of my words and truthful
  expression of my sentiments.
  I have not given a detailed account of the ways and means which were
  devised to bring me under subjection, and so extract from me a declaration
  that the spiritual phenomena as exemplified through my organism were a fraud.
  But I shall fully atone for this incompleteness when I get upon the
  platform.</p>

  <p>The exactness of this interview was testified to by the names of a number
  of witnesses, including J. L. O'Sullivan, who was U.S. Minister to Portugal
  for twenty-five years. He said, "If ever I heard a woman speak truth, it was
  then."</p>

  <p>So it may have been, but the failure of her lecture-agent to keep her in
  funds seems to have been the determining factor.</p>

  <p>The statement would settle the question if we could take the speaker's
  words at face value, but unfortunately the author is compelled to agree with
  Mr. Isaac Funk, an indefatigable and impartial researcher, that Margaret at
  this period of her life could not be relied upon.</p>

  <p>What is a good deal more to the purpose is that Mr. Funk sat with
  Margaret, that he heard the raps "all round the room" without detecting their
  origin, and that they spelt out to him a name and address which were correct
  and entirely beyond the knowledge of the medium. The information given was
  wrong, but, on the other hand, abnormal power was shown by reading the
  contents of a letter in Mr. Funk's pocket. Such mixed results are as puzzling
  as the other larger problem discussed in this chapter.</p>

  <p>There is one factor which has been scarcely touched upon in this
  examination. It is the character and career of Mrs. Fish, afterwards Mrs.
  Underhill, who as Leah, the elder sister, plays so prominent a part in the
  matter. We know her chiefly by her book, " The Missing Link in Modern
  Spiritualism" (Knox &amp; Co., New York, 1885). This book was written by a
  friend, but the facts and documents were provided by Mrs. Underhill, who
  checked the whole narrative. It is simply and even crudely put together, and
  the Spiritualist is bound to conclude that the entities with whom the Fox
  circle were at first in contact were not always of the highest order. Perhaps
  on another plane, as on this, it is the plebeians and the lowly who carry out
  spiritual pioneer work in their own rough way and open the path for other and
  more refined agencies. With this sole criticism, one may say that the book
  gives a sure impression of candour and good sense, and as a personal
  narrative of one who was so nearly concerned in these momentous happenings,
  it is destined to outlive most of our current literature and to be read with
  close attention and even with reverence by generations unborn. Those humble
  folk who watched over the new birth&mdash;Capron, of Auburn, who first
  lectured upon it in public; Jervis, the gallant Methodist minister, who
  cried, "I know it is true, and I will face the frowning world!"; George
  Willetts, the Quaker; Isaac Post, who called the first spiritual meeting; the
  gallant band who testified upon the Rochester platform while the rowdies were
  heating the tar&mdash;all of them are destined to live in history. Of Leah it
  can truly be said that she recognized the religious meaning of the movement
  far more clearly than her sisters were able to do, and that she set her face
  against that use of it for purely worldly objects which is a degradation of
  the celestial. The following passage is of great interest as showing how the
  Fox family first regarded this visitation, and must impress the reader with
  the sincerity of the writer:</p>

  <p class="quote">The general feeling of our family was strongly adverse to
all this strange
  and uncanny thing. We regarded it as a great misfortune which had fallen upon
  us; how, whence or why we knew not . We resisted it, struggled against it,
  and constantly and earnestly prayed for deliverance from it, even while a
  strange fascination attached to these marvellous manifestations thus forced
  upon us, against our will, by invisible agencies and agents whom we could
  neither resist, control nor understand. If our will, earnest desires and
  prayers could have prevailed or availed, the whole thing would have ended
  then and there, and the world outside of our little neighbourhood would never
  have heard more of the Rochester Rappings, or of the unfortunate Fox
  family.</p>

  <p>These words give the impression of sincerity, and altogether Leah stands
  forth in her book, and in the evidence of the many witnesses quoted, as one
  who was worthy to play a part in a great movement.</p>

  <p>Both Kate Fox Jencken and Margaret Fox-Kane died in the early 'nineties,
  and their end was one of sadness and gloom. The problem which they present is
  put fairly before the reader, avoiding the extremes of the too sensitive
  Spiritualist who will not face the facts, and the special-pleading sceptics
  who lay stress upon those parts of the narrative which suit their purpose and
  omit or minimize everything else. Let us see, at the cost of a break in our
  narrative, if any sort of explanation can be found which covers the double
  fact that what these sisters could do was plainly abnormal, and yet that it
  was, to some extent at least, under their control. It is not a simple
  problem, but an exceedingly deep one which exhausts, and more than exhausts,
  the psychic knowledge which is at this date available, and was altogether
  beyond the reach of the generation in which the Fox sisters were alive.</p>

  <p>The simple explanation which was given by the Spiritualists of the time is
  not to be set aside readily&mdash;and least readily by those who know most.
  It was that a medium who ill-uses her gifts and suffers debasement of moral
  character through bad habits, becomes accessible to evil influences which may
  use her for false information or for the defilement of a pure cause. That may
  be true enough as a <i>causa causans</i>. But we must look closer to see the
  actual how and why.</p>

  <p>The author is of opinion that the true explanation will be found by
  coupling all these happenings with the recent investigations of Dr. Crawford
  upon the means by which physical phenomena are produced. He showed very
  clearly, as is detailed in a subsequent chapter, that raps (we are dealing at
  present only with that phase) are caused by a protrusion from the medium's
  person of a long rod of a substance having certain properties which
  distinguish it from all other forms of matter. This substance has been
  closely examined by the great French physiologist, Dr. Charles Richet, who
  has named it "ectoplasm." These rods are invisible to the eye, partly visible
  to the sensitive plate, and yet conduct energy in such a fashion as to make
  sounds and strike blows at a distance.</p>

  <p>Now, if Margaret produced the raps in the same fashion as Crawford's
  medium, we have only to make one or two assumptions which are probable in
  them selves, and which the science of the future may definitely prove in
  order to make the case quite clear. The one assumption is that a centre of
  psychic force is formed in some part of the body from which the ectoplasm rod
  is protruded. Supposing that centre to be in Margaret's foot, it would throw
  a very clear light upon the evidence collected in the Seybert inquiry. In
  examining Margaret and endeavouring to get raps from her, one of the
  committee, with the permission of the medium, placed his hand upon her foot.
  Raps at once followed. The investigator cried: "This is the most wonderful
  thing of all, Mrs. Kane. I distinctly feel them in your foot. There is not a
  particle of motion in your foot, but there is an unusual pulsation."</p>

  <p>This experiment by no means bears out the idea of joint dislocation or
  snapping toes. It is, however, exactly what one could imagine in the case of
  a centre from which psychic power was projected. This power is in material
  shape and is drawn from the body of the medium, so that there must be some
  nexus. This nexus may vary. In the case quoted it was in Margaret's foot. It
  was observed by the Buffalo doctors that there was a subtle movement of a
  medium at the moment of a rap. The observation was correct, though the
  inference was wrong. The author has himself distinctly seen in the case of an
  amateur medium a slight general pulsation when a rap was given&mdash;a
  recoil, as it were, after the discharge of force.</p>

  <p>Granting that Margaret's power worked in this way, we have now only to
  discuss whether ectoplasmic rods can under any circumstances be protruded at
  will. So far as the author knows, there are no observations which bear
  directly upon the point. Crawford's medium seems always to have manifested
  when in trance, so that the question did not arise. In other physical
  phenomena there is some reason to think that in their simpler form they are
  closely connected with the medium, but that as they progress they pass out of
  her control and are swayed by forces outside herself. Thus the ectoplasm
  pictures photographed by Madame Bisson and Dr. Schrenck Notzing (as shown in
  his recent book) may in their first forms be ascribed to the medium's
  thoughts or memories taking visible shape in ectoplasm, but as she becomes
  lost in trance they take the form of figures which in extreme cases are
  endowed with independent life. If there be a general analogy between the two
  classes of phenomena, then it is entirely possible that Margaret had some
  control over the expulsion of ectoplasm which caused the sound, but that when
  the sound gave forth messages which were beyond her possible knowledge, as in
  the case instanced by Funk, the power was no longer used by her but by some
  independent intelligence.</p>

  <p>It is to be remembered that no one is more ignorant of how effects are
  produced than the medium, who is the centre of them. One of the greatest
  physical mediums in the world told the author once that he had never
  witnessed a physical phenomenon, as he was himself always in trance when they
  occurred; the opinion of any one of the sitters would be more valuable than
  his own. Thus in the case of these Fox sisters, who were mere children when
  the phenomena began, they knew little of the philosophy of the subject, and
  Margaret frequently said that she did not understand her own results. If she
  found that she had herself some power of producing the raps, however obscure
  the way by which she did it, she would be in a frame of mind when she might
  well find it impossible to contradict Dr. Kane when he accused her of being
  concerned in it. Her confession, too, and that of her sister, would to that
  extent be true, but each would be aware, as they afterwards admitted, that
  there was a great deal more which could not be explained and which did not
  emanate from themselves.</p>

  <p>There remains, however, one very important point to be discussed &mdash;
  the most important of all to those who accept the religious significance of
  this movement. It is a most natural argument for those who are unversed in
  the subject to say, "Are these your fruits? Can a philosophy or religion be
  good which has such an effect upon those who have had a prominent place in
  its establishment?" No one can cavil at such an objection, and it calls for a
  clear answer, which has often been made and yet is in need of repetition.</p>

  <p>Let it then be clearly stated that there is no more connexion between
  physical mediumship and morality than there is between a refined ear for
  music and morality. Both are purely physical gifts. The musician might
  interpret the most lovely thoughts and excite the highest emotions in others,
  influencing their thoughts and raising their minds. Yet in himself he might
  be a drug-taker, a dipsomaniac, or a pervert. On the other hand, he might
  combine his musical powers with an angelic personal character. There is
  simply no connexion at all between the two things, save that they both have
  their centre in the same human body.</p>

  <p>So it is in physical mediumship. We all, or nearly all, exude a certain
  substance from our bodies which has very peculiar properties. With most of
  us, as is shown by Crawford's weighing chairs, the amount is negligible. With
  one in 100,000 it is considerable. That person is a physical medium. He or
  she gives forth a raw material which can, we hold, be used by independent
  external forces. The individual's character has nothing to do with the
  matter. Such is the result of two generations of observation.</p>

  <p>If it were exactly as stated, then, the physical medium's character would
  be in no way affected by his gift. Unfortunately, that is to understate the
  case. Under our present unintelligent conditions, the physical medium is
  subjected to certain moral risks which it takes a strong and well-guarded
  nature to withstand. The failures of these most useful and devoted people may
  be likened to those physical injuries, the loss of fingers and hands,
  incurred by those who have worked with the X-rays before their full
  properties were comprehended. Means have been taken to overcome these
  physical dangers after a certain number have become martyrs for science, and
  the moral dangers will also be met when a tardy reparation will be made to
  the pioneers who have injured themselves in forcing the gates of knowledge.
  These dangers lie in the weakening of the will, in the extreme debility after
  phenomenal sittings, and the temptation to gain temporary relief from
  alcohol, in the temptation to fraud when the power wanes, and in the mixed
  and possibly noxious spirit influences which surround a promiscuous circle,
  drawn together from motives of curiosity rather than of religion. The remedy
  is to segregate mediums, to give them salaries instead of paying them by
  results, to regulate the number of their sittings and the character of the
  sitters, and thus to remove them from influences which overwhelmed the Fox
  sisters as they have done other of the strongest mediums in the past. On the
  other hand, there are physical mediums who retain such high motives and work
  upon such religious lines that they are the salt of the earth. It is the same
  power which is used by the Buddha and by the Woman of Endor. The objects and
  methods of its use are what determine the character.</p>

  <p>The author has said that there is little connexion between physical
  mediumship and morality. One could imagine the ectoplasmic flow being as
  brisk from a sinner as from a saint, impinging upon material objects in the
  same way and producing results which would equally have the good effect of
  convincing the materialist of forces outside his ken. This does not apply,
  however, to internal mediumship, taking the form not of phenomena but of
  teaching and messages, given either by spirit voice, human voice, automatic
  writing, or any other device. Here the vessel is chosen that it may match
  what it contains. One could not imagine a small nature giving temporary
  habitation to a great spirit. One must be a Vale Owen before one gets Vale
  Owen messages. If a high medium degenerated in character, I should expect to
  find the messages cease or else share in the degeneration. Hence, too, the
  messages of a divine spirit such as is periodically sent to cleanse the
  world, of a mediaeval saint, of Joan of Arc, of Swedenborg, of Andrew Jackson
  Davis, or of the humblest automatic writer in London, provided that the
  impulse is a true one, are really the same thing in various degrees. Each is
  a genuine breath from beyond, and yet each intermediary tinges with his or
  her personality the message which comes through. So, as in a glass darkly, we
  see this wondrous mystery, so vital and yet so undefined. It is its very
  greatness which prevents it from being defined. We have done a little, but we
  hand back many a problem to those who march behind us. They may look upon our
  own most advanced speculation as elementary, and yet may see vistas of
  thought before them which will stretch to the uttermost bounds of their
  mental vision.</p>

  </div><br>

  <p class="first">HAVING dealt with the history of the Fox family and the
  problems which that history raises, we shall now return to America and note
  the first effects of this invasion from another sphere of being.</p>

  <p>These effects were not entirely excellent. There were follies on the part
  of individuals and extravagances on that of communities.</p>

  <p>One of these, based on communications received through the mediumship of
  Mrs. Benedict, was the Apostolic Circle. It was started by a small group of
  men, strong believers in a second advent, who sought through spirit
  communications to confirm that belief. They obtained what they proclaimed to
  be communications from Apostles and prophets of the Bible. In 1849 James L.
  Scott, a Seventh Day Baptist minister of Brooklyn, joined this circle at
  Auburn, which now became known as the Apostolic Movement, and its spiritual
  leader was said to be the Apostle Paul. Scott was joined by the Rev. Thomas
  Lake Harris, and they established at Mountain Cove the religious community
  which attracted a strong following, until after some years their dupes became
  disillusioned and deserted their autocratic leaders.</p>

  <p>This man, Thomas Lake Harris, is certainly one of the most curious
  personalities of whom we have any record, and it is hard to say whether
  Jekyll or Hyde predominated in his character. He was compounded of extremes,
  and everything which he did was outstanding for good or for evil. He was
  originally a Universalist minister, whence he derived the "Rev." which he
  long used as a prefix. He broke away from his associates, adopted the
  teachings of Andrew Jackson Davis, became a fanatical Spiritualist, and
  finally, as already stated, claimed to be one of the autocratic rulers of the
  souls and purses of the colonists of Mountain Cove. There came a time,
  however, when the said colonists concluded that they were quite capable of
  looking after their own affairs both spiritual and material, so Harris found
  his vocation gone. He then came to New York and threw himself violently into
  the Spiritualistic movement, preaching at Dodworth Hall, the head-quarters of
  the cult, and gaining a great and deserved reputation for remarkable
  eloquence. His megalomania&mdash;possibly an obsession&mdash;broke out once
  more, and he made extravagant claims which the sane and sober Spiritualists
  around him would not tolerate. There was one claim, however, which he could
  go to some length in making good, and that was inspiration from a very true
  and high poetic afflatus, though whether inborn or from without it is
  impossible to say. While at this stage of his career he, or some power
  through him, produced a series of poems, "A Lyric of the Golden Age," "The
  Morning Land," and others, which do occasionally touch the stars. Piqued by
  the refusal of the New York Spiritualists to admit his supernal claims,
  Harris then (1859) went to England, where he gained fame by his eloquence,
  shown in lectures which consisted of denunciations of his own former
  colleagues in New York. Each successive step in the man's life was
  accompanied by a defilement of the last step from which he had come.</p>

  <p>In 1860, in London, Harris's life suddenly assumes a closer interest to
  Britons, especially to those who have literary affinities. Harris lectured at
  Steinway Hall, and while there Lady Oliphant listened to his wild eloquence,
  and was so affected by it that she brought the American preacher into touch
  with her son, Laurence Oliphant, one of the most brilliant men of his
  generation. It is difficult to see where the attraction lay, for the teaching
  of Harris at this stage had nothing uncommon in its matter, save that he
  seems to have adopted the Father-God and Mother-Nature idea which was thrown
  out by Davis. Oliphant placed Harris high as a poet, referring to him as "the
  greatest poet of the age as yet unknown to fame." Oliphant was no mean judge,
  and yet in an age which included Tennyson, Longfellow, Browning, and so many
  more, the phrase seems extravagant. The end of the whole episode was that,
  after delays and vacillations, both mother and son surrendered themselves
  entirely to Harris, and went forth to manual labour in a new colony at
  Brocton in New York, where they remained in a condition which was virtual
  slavery save that it was voluntary. Whether such self-abnegation is saintly
  or idiotic is a question for the angels. It certainly seems idiotic when we
  learn that Laurence Oliphant had the greatest difficulty in getting leave to
  marry, and expressed humble gratitude to the tyrant when he was at last
  allowed to do so. He was set free to report the Franco-German War of 1870,
  which he did in the brilliant manner that might be expected of him, and then
  he returned to his servitude once more, one of his duties being to sell
  strawberries in baskets to the passing trains, while he was arbitrarily
  separated from his young wife, she being sent to Southern California and he
  retained at Brocton. It was not until the year 1882, twenty years from his
  first entanglement, that Oliphant, his mother being then dead, broke these
  extraordinary bonds, and after a severe struggle, in the course of which
  Harris took steps to have him incarcerated in an asylum, rejoined his wife,
  recovered some of his property, and resumed his normal life. He drew the
  prophet Harris in his book "Masollam," written in his later years, and the
  result is so characteristic both of Oliphant's brilliant word-painting and of
  the extraordinary man whom he painted, that the reader will perhaps be glad
  to refer to it in the Appendix.</p>

  <p>Such developments as Harris and others were only excrescences on the main
  Spiritualistic movement, which generally speaking was sane and progressive.
  The freaks stood in the way of its acceptance, however, as the communistic or
  free love sentiments of some of these wild sects were unscrupulously
  exploited by the opposition as being typical of the whole.</p>

  <p>We have seen that though the spiritual manifestations obtained wide public
  notice through the Fox girls, they were known long before this. To the pre
  ceding testimony to this effect we may add that of Judge Edmonds, who says:*
  "It is about five years since the subject first attracted public attention,
  though we discover now that for the previous ten or twelve years there had
  been more or less of it in different parts of the country, but it had been
  kept concealed, either from fear of ridicule or from ignorance of what it
  was." This explains the surprising number of mediums who began to be heard of
  immediately after the publicity obtained through the Fox family. It was no
  new gift they exhibited, it was only that their courageous action in making
  it widely known made others come forward and confess that they possessed the
  same power. Also this universal gift of mediumistic faculties now for the
  first time began to be freely developed. The result was that mediums were
  heard of in ever-increasing numbers. In April, 1849, manifestations occurred
  in the family of the Rev. A. H. Jervis, the Methodist minister of Rochester,
  in that of Mr. Lyman Granger, also of Rochester, and in the home of Deacon
  Hale, in the neighbouring town of Greece. So, too, six families in the
  adjoining town of Auburn began to develop mediumship. In none of these cases
  had the Fox girls any connexion with what took place. So these leaders simply
  blazed the trail along which others followed.</p>

  <p class="footnote">* <i>Spiritualism</i>, by John W. Edmonds and George T.
  Dexter, M.D., New York, 1853, p. 36.</p>

  <p>Outstanding features of the next succeeding years were the rapid growth of
  mediums on every side, and the conversion to a belief in Spiritualism of
  great public men like Judge Edmonds, ex-Governor Tallmadge, Professor Robert
  Hare, and Professor Mapes. The public support of such well-known men gave
  enormous publicity to the subject, while at the same time it increased the
  virulence of the opposition, which now perceived it had to deal with more
  than a handful of silly, deluded people. Men such as these could command a
  hearing in the Press of the day. There was also a change in the character of
  the spiritual phenomena. In the years 1851-2 Mrs. Hayden and D.D. Home were
  instrumental in making many converts. We shall have more to say about these
  mediums in later chapters.</p>

  <p>In a communication addressed "To the Public," published in the <i>New York
  Courier</i> and dated New York, August 1, 1853, Judge Edmonds, a man of high
  character and clear intellect, gave a convincing account of his own
  experience. It is a curious thing that the United States, which at that time
  gave conspicuous evidence of moral courage in its leading citizens, has
  seemed to fall behind in recent years in this respect, for the author in his
  recent journeys there found many who were aware of psychic truth and yet
  shrank in the face of a jeering Press from publishing their convictions.</p>

  <p>Judge Edmonds, in the article alluded to, began by detailing the train of
  events which caused him to form his opinions. It is dwelt upon here in some
  detail, because it is very important as showing the basis on which a highly
  educated than received the new teaching:</p>

  <p class="quote">It was January 1851 that my attention was first called to
the subject of
  "spiritual intercourse." I was at the time withdrawn from general society; I
  was labouring under great depression of spirits. I was occupying all my
  leisure in reading on the subject of death and man's existence afterward. I
  had, in the course of my life, read and heard from the pulpit so many
  contradictory and conflicting doctrines on the subject, that I hardly knew
  what to believe. I could not, if I would, believe what I did not understand,
  and was anxiously seeking to know, if, after death, we should again meet with
  those whom we had loved here, and under what circumstances. I was invited by
  a friend to witness the "Rochester Knockings." I complied more to oblige her,
  and to while away a tedious hour. I thought a good deal on what I witnessed,
  and I determined to investigate the matter and find out what it was. If it
  was a deception, or a delusion, I thought that I could detect it. For about
  four months I devoted at least two evenings in a week and sometimes more to
  witnessing the phenomena in all its phases. I kept careful records of all I
  witnessed, and from time to time compared them with each other, to detect
  inconsistencies and contradictions. I read all I could lay my hands on on the
  subject, and especially all the professed "exposures of the humbug." I went
  from place to place, seeing different mediums, meeting with different parties
  of persons&mdash;often with persons whom I had never seen before, and
  sometimes where I was myself entirely unknown&mdash;sometimes in the dark and
  sometimes in the light&mdash;often with inveterate unbelievers, and more
  frequently with zealous believers.</p>

  <p class="quote">In fine, I availed myself of every opportunity that was
afforded,
  thoroughly to sift the matter to the bottom. I was all this time an
  unbeliever, and tried the patience of believers sorely by my scepticism, my
  captiousness, and my obdurate refusal to yield my belief. I saw around me
  some who yielded a ready faith on one or two sittings only; others again,
  under the same circumstances, avowing a determined unbelief; and some who
  refused to witness it at all, and yet were confirmed unbelievers. I could not
  imitate either of these parties, and refused to yield unless upon most
  irrefragable testimony. At length the evidence came, and in such force that
  no sane man could withhold his faith.</p>

  <p>It will thus be seen that this, the earliest outstanding convert to the
  new revelation, took the utmost pains before he allowed the evidence to
  convince him of the validity of the claims of the spirit. General experience
  shows that a facile acceptance of these claims is very rare among earnest
  thinkers, and that there is hardly any prominent Spiritualist whose course of
  study and reflection has not involved a novitiate of many years. This forms a
  striking contrast to those negative opinions which are founded upon initial
  prejudice and the biased or scandalous accounts of partisan authors.</p>

  <p>Judge Edmonds, in the excellent summary of his position given in the
  article already quoted&mdash;an article which should have converted the whole
  American people had they been ready for assimilation&mdash;proceeds to show
  the solid basis of his beliefs. He points out that he was never alone when
  these manifestations occurred, and that he had many witnesses. He also shows
  the elaborate precautions which he took:</p>

  <p class="quote">After depending upon my senses, as to these various phases
of the
  phenomenon, I invoked the aid of science, and, with the assistance of an
  accomplished electrician and his machinery, and eight or ten intelligent,
  educated, shrewd persons, examined the matter. We pursued our inquiries many
  days, and established to our satisfaction two things: first, that the sounds
  were not produced by the agency of any person present or near us; and,
  second, that they were not forthcoming at our will and pleasure.</p>

  <p>He deals faithfully with the alleged "exposures" in newspapers, some of
  which at long intervals are true indictments of some villain, but which
  usually are greater deceptions, conscious or unconscious, of the public than
  the evils which they profess to attack. Thus:</p>

  <p class="quote">While these things were going on, there appeared in the
newspapers various
  explanations and "exposures of the humbug," as they were termed. I read them
  with care, in the expectation of being assisted in my researches, and I could
  not but smile at once at the rashness and the futility of the explanations.
  For instance, while certain learned professors in Buffalo were congratulating
  themselves on having detected it in the toe and knee joints, the
  manifestations in this city changed to ringing a bell placed under the table.
  They were like the solution lately given by a learned professor in England,
  who attributes the tipping of tables to a force in the hands which are laid
  upon them, overlooking the material fact that tables quite as frequently move
  when there is no hand upon them.</p>

  <p>Having dealt with the objectivity of the phenomena, the judge next touched
  upon the more important question of their source. He commented upon the fact
  that he had answers to mental questions and found that his own secret
  thoughts were revealed, and that purposes which he had privily entertained
  had been made manifest. He notes also that he had heard the mediums use
  Greek, Latin, Spanish, and French, when they were ignorant of these
  languages.</p>

  <p>This drives him to the consideration of whether these things may not be
  explained as the reflection of the mind of some other living human being.
  These considerations have been exhausted by every inquirer in turn, for
  Spiritualists do not accept their creed in one bound, but make the journey
  step by step, with much timid testing of the path. Judge Edmonds's epitome of
  his course is but that which many others have followed. He gives the
  following reasons for negativing this question of other human minds:</p>

  <p class="quote">Facts were communicated which were unknown then, but
afterward found to be
  true; like this, for instance when I was absent last winter in Central
  America, my friends in town heard of my whereabouts and of the state of my
  health seven times; and on my return, by comparing their information with the
  entries in my journal it was found to be invariably correct. So, in my recent
  visit to the West my whereabouts and my condition were told to a medium in
  this city, while I was travelling on the railroad between Cleveland and
  Toledo. So thoughts have been uttered on subjects not then in my mind, and
  utterly at variance with my own notions. This has often happened to me and to
  others, so as fully to establish the fact that it was not our minds that gave
  birth to or affected the communication.</p>

  <p>He then deals with the object of this marvellous development, and he
  points out its overwhelming religious significance on the general lines with
  which it is defined in a subsequent chapter of this work. Judge Edmonds's
  brain was indeed a remarkable one, and his judgment clear, for there is very
  little which we can add to his statement, and perhaps it has never been so
  well expressed in so small a compass. As we point to it one can claim that
  Spiritualism has been consistent from the first, and that the teachers and
  guides have not mixed their message. It is a strange and an amusing
  reflection that the arrogant science which endeavoured by its mere word and
  glare to crush this upstart knowledge in 1850 has been proved to be
  essentially wrong on its own ground. There are hardly any scientific axioms
  of that day, the finality of the element, the indivisibility of the atom, the
  separate origin of species, which have not been controverted, whereas the
  psychic knowledge which was so derided has steadily held its own, adding
  fresh facts but never contradicting those which were originally put
  forward.</p>

  <p>Writing of the beneficent effects of this knowledge the judge says:</p>

  <p class="quote">There is that which comforts the mourner and binds up the
broken-hearted;
  that which smooths the passage to the grave and robs death of its terrors;
  that which enlightens the atheist and cannot but reform the vicious; that
  which cheers and encourages the virtuous amid all the trials and vicissitudes
  of life; and that which demonstrates to man his duty and his destiny, leaving
  it no longer vague and uncertain.</p>

  <p>The matter has never been better summed up than that.</p>

  <p>There is, however, one final passage in this remarkable document which
  causes some sadness. Speaking of the progress which the movement had made
  within four years in the United States, he says: "There are ten or twelve
  newspapers and periodicals devoted to the cause and the spiritual library
  embraces more than one hundred different publications, some of which have
  already attained a circulation of more than 10,000 copies. Besides the
  undistinguished multitude there are many men of high standing and talent
  ranked among them&mdash;doctors, lawyers, and clergymen in great numbers, a
  Protestant bishop, the learned and reverend president of a college, judges of
  our higher courts, members of Congress, foreign ambassadors and ex-members of
  the United States Senate." In four years the spirit force had done as much as
  this. How does the matter stand to-day? The "undistinguished multitude" has
  carried bravely on and the hundred publications have grown into many more,
  but where are the men of light and leading who point the path? Since the
  death of Professor Hyslop it is difficult to point to one man of eminence in
  the United States who is ready to stake his career and reputation upon the
  issue. Those who would have never feared the tyranny of man have shrank from
  the cat-calling of the public Press. The printing-machine has succeeded where
  the rack would have failed. The worldly loss in reputation and in business
  sustained by Judge Edmonds himself, who had to resign his seat upon the
  Supreme Court of New York, and by many others who testified to the truth,
  established a reign of terror which warns the intellectual classes from the
  subject. So the matter stands at present.</p>

  <p>But the Press, for the moment, was well-disposed and Judge Edmonds's
  famous summing-up, perhaps the finest and most momentous that any judge has
  ever delivered, met with respect, if not with concurrence. <i>The New York
  Courier</i> wrote:</p>

  <p class="quote">The letter from Judge Edmonds, published by us on Saturday,
with regard to
  the so-called spiritual manifestations, coming as it did from an eminent
  jurist, a man remarkable for his clear common sense in the practical affairs
  of life, and a gentleman of irreproachable character, arrested the attention
  of the community, and is regarded by many persons as one of the most
  remarkable documents of the day.</p>

  <p>The <i>New York Evening Mirror</i> said:</p>

  <p class="quote">John W. Edmonds, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court for
this district,
  is an able lawyer, an industrious judge and a good citizen. For the last
  eight years occupying without interruption the highest judicial stations,
  whatever may be his faults no one can justly accuse him of lack of ability,
  industry, honesty or fearlessness. No one can doubt his general saneness, or
  can believe for a moment that the ordinary operations of his mind are not as
  rapid, accurate and reliable as ever. Both by the practitioners and suitors
  at his bar he is recognized as the head, in fact and in merit, of the Supreme
  Court for this District.</p>

  <p>The experience of Dr. Robert Hare, Professor of Chemistry in the
  University of Pennsylvania, is also of interest, because he was one of the
  first eminent men of science who, setting out to expose the delusion of
  Spiritualism, became finally a firm believer. It was in 1853 that, in his own
  words, he "felt called upon, as an act of duty to his fellow creatures, to
  bring whatever influence he possessed to the attempt to stem the tide of
  popular madness which, in defiance of reason and science, was fast setting in
  favour of the gross delusion called Spiritualism." A denunciatory letter of
  his published in the newspapers of Philadelphia, where he lived, was copied
  by other newspapers all over the country, and it was made the text of
  numerous sermons. But, as with Sir William Crookes many years later, the
  jubilation was premature. Professor Hare, though a strong sceptic, was
  induced to experiment for himself, and after a period of careful testing he
  became entirely convinced of the spiritual origin of the manifestations. Like
  Crookes, he devised apparatus for use with mediums. Mr. S. B. Brittan, editor
  of <i>The Spiritual Telegraph</i>, gives the following condensed account of
  some of Hare's experiments:</p>

  <p class="quote">First, to satisfy himself that the movements were not the
works of
  mortals, he took brass billiard balls, placed them on zinc plates and placed
  the hands of the mediums on the balls and, to his very great astonishment the
  tables moved. He next arranged a table to slide backward and forward, to
  which attachments were made, causing a disc to revolve containing the
  alphabet, <i>hidden from the view of the mediums</i>. The letters were
  variously arranged, out of their regular consecutive order, and the spirit
  was required to place them consecutively or in their regular places. And
  behold, it was done! Then followed intelligent sentences which the medium
  could not see or know the import of till they were told him.</p>

  <p class="quote">Again he tried another capital test. The long end of a
lever was placed on
  spiral scales with an index attached and the weight marked; the medium's hand
  rested on the short end of the beam, where it was impossible to give pressure
  downward, but if pressed it would have a contrary effect and raise the long
  end; and yet, most astounding, the weight was increased several pounds on the
  scale.</p>

  <p>Professor Hare embodied his careful researches and his views on
  Spiritualism in an important book published in New York in 1855, entitled
  "Experimental Investigation of the Spirit Manifestations." In this (p. 55) he
  sums up the results of his early experiments as follows:</p>

  <p class="quote">The evidence of the manifestations adduced in the foregoing
narrative does
  not rest upon myself only, since there have been persons present when they
  were observed, and they have in my presence been repeated essentially under
  various modifications in many instances not specially alluded to.</p>

  <p class="quote">The evidence may be contemplated under various phases;
first, those in
  which rappings or other noises have been made which could not be traced to
  any mortal agency; secondly, those in which sounds were so made as to
  indicate letters forming grammatical, well-spelt sentences, affording proof
  that they were under the guidance of some rational being; thirdly, those in
  which the nature of the communication has been such as to prove that the
  being causing them must, agreeably to accompanying allegations, be some known
  acquaintance, friend, or relative of the inquirer.</p>

  <p class="quote">Again, cases in which movements have been made of
ponderable bodies of a
  nature to produce intellectual communications resembling those obtained, as
  abovementioned, by sounds.</p>

  <p class="quote">Although the apparatus by which these various proofs were
attained <i>with
  the greatest possible precaution and precision</i>, modified them as to the
  manner, essentially all the evidence which I have obtained tending to the
  conclusions above mentioned, has likewise been substantially obtained by a
  great number of observers. Many who never sought any spiritual communication
  and have not been induced to enroll themselves as Spiritualists, will
  nevertheless not only affirm the existence of the sounds and movements, but
  also admit their inscrutability.</p>

  <p>Mr. James J. Mapes, LL.D., of New York, an agricultural chemist and member
  of various learned societies, commenced his investigation into Spiritualism
  in order to rescue, as he said, his friends, who were "running to imbecility"
  over the new craze. Through the mediumship of Mrs. Cora Hatch, afterwards
  Mrs. Richmond, he received what are described as marvellous scientific
  answers to his questions. He ended by becoming a thorough believer, and his
  wife, who had no artistic talent, became a drawing and painting medium. His
  daughter had, unknown to him, become a writing medium, and when she spoke to
  him about this development he asked her to give him an exhibition of her
  power. She took a pen and rapidly wrote what professed to be a message from
  Professor Mapes's father. The Professor asked for a proof of identity. His
  daughter's hand at once wrote: "You may recollect that I gave you, among
  other books, an Encyclopaedia; look at page 120 of that book, and you will
  find my name written there, which you have never seen." The book referred to
  was stored with others at a warehouse. When Professor Mapes opened the case,
  which had been undisturbed for twenty-seven years, to his astonishment he
  found his father's name written on page 120. It was this incident which first
  led him to make a serious investigation, for, like his friend Professor Hare,
  he had up till that time been a strong materialist.</p>

  <p>In April, 1854, the Hon. James Shields presented a memorial,* praying for
  inquiry, to the United States legislature, with thirteen thousand signatures
  attached, and with the name of Governor Tallmadge at the head of the list.
  After a frivolous discussion, in which Mr. Shields, who presented the
  petition, referred to the belief held by the petitioners as due to a delusion
  arising from defective education or deranged mental faculties, it was
  formally agreed that the petition should lie upon the table. Mr. E. W. Capron
  has this comment**:</p>

  <p class="footnote">*See Capron, <i>Modern Spiritualism</i>, pp. 359-
  363.<br>
  ** <i>Modern Spiritualism</i>, p. 375. <i>Modern Spiritualism</i>, p.
  197.</p>

  <p class="quote">It is not probable that any of the memorialists expected
more favourable
  treatment than they received. The carpenters and fishermen of the world are
  the ones to investigate new truths and make Senates and Crowns believe and
  respect them. It is in vain to look for the reception or respect of new
  truths by men in high places.</p>

  <p>The first regular Spiritualist organization was formed in New York on June
  10, 1854. It was entitled the "Society for the Diffusion of Spiritual
  Knowledge," and included among its members such prominent people as Judge
  Edmonds and Governor Tallmadge, of Wisconsin.</p>

  <p>Among the activities of the society was the establishment of a newspaper
  called The Christian Spiritualist, and the engagement of Miss Kate Fox to
  hold daily séances, to which the public were admitted free each morning from
  ten till one o'clock.</p>

  <p>Writing in 1855 Capron says:</p>

  <p class="quote">It would be impossible to state particulars in regard to
the spread of
  Spiritualism in New York up to the present time. It has become diffused
  throughout the city, and has almost ceased to be a curiosity or a wonder to
  any. Public meetings are regularly held, and the investigation is constantly
  going on, but the days of excitement on the subject have passed away, and all
  parties look upon it as, at least, something more than a mere trick. It is
  true that religious bigotry denounces it, but without disputing the
  occurrences, and occasionally a pretended expose' is made for purposes of
  speculation; but the fact of spiritual intercourse has become an acknowledged
  fact in the Empire city.</p>

  <p>Perhaps the most significant fact of the period we have been considering
  was the development of mediumship in prominent people, as, for instance,
  Judge Edmonds and Professor Hare. The latter writes*:</p>

  <p class="quote">Having latterly acquired the powers of a medium in a
sufficient degree to
  interchange ideas with my spirit friends, I am no longer under the necessity
  of defending media from the charge of falsehood and deception. It is now my
  own character only that can be in question.</p>

  <p class="footnote">* <i>Experimental Investigation Of The Spirit
  Manifestations</i>, p. 54.</p>

  <p>Thus, dismissing the Fox girls from the field altogether, we have the
  private mediumship of Rev. A. H. Jervis, Deacon Hale, Lyman Granger, Judge
  Edmonds, Professor Hare, Mrs. Mapes, Miss Mapes, and the public mediumship of
  Mrs. Tamlin, Mrs. Benedict, Mrs. Hayden, D.D. Home, and dozens of others.</p>

  <p>It is not within the scope of this work to deal with the great number of
  individual cases of mediumship, some of them most dramatic and interesting,
  which occurred during this first period of demonstration. The reader is
  referred to Mrs. Hardinge Britten's two important compilations, "Modern
  American Spiritualism" and "Nineteenth Century Miracles," books which will
  always be a most valuable record of early days. The series of phenomenal
  cases was so great that Mrs. Britten has counted over five thousand separate
  instances recorded in the Press in the first few years, which probably
  represents some hundreds of thousands not so recorded. Religion so-called and
  Science so-called united for once in an unholy attempt to misrepresent and
  persecute the new truth and its supporters, while the Press unfortunately
  found that its interest lay in playing up to the prejudices of the majority
  of its subscribers. It was easy to do this, for naturally, in so vital and
  compelling a movement, there were some who became fanatical, some who threw
  discredit upon their opinions by their actions, and some who took advantage
  of the general interest to imitate, with more or less success, the real gifts
  of the spirit. These fraudulent rascals were sometimes mere cold-blooded
  swindlers, and sometimes seem to have been real mediums whose psychic power
  had for a time deserted them. There were scandals and exposures, some real
  and some pretended. These exposures were then, as now, due often to the
  Spiritualists themselves, who strongly objected to their sacred ceremonies
  being a screen for the hypocrisies and blasphemies of those villains who,
  like human hyenas, tried to make a fraudulent living out of the dead. The
  general result was to take the edge off the first fine enthusiasm, and to set
  back the acceptance of what was true by an eternal harping on what was
  false.</p>

  <p>The brave report of Professor Hare led to a disgraceful persecution of
  that venerable savant, who was at that moment, with the exception of Agassiz,
  the best-known man of science in America. The professors of Harvard&mdash;a
  university which has a most unenviable record in psychic matters &mdash;
  passed a resolution denouncing him and his "insane adherence to a gigantic
  humbug." He could not lose his professorial chair at Pennsylvania University
  because that had been already resigned, but he suffered much in loss of
  reputation.</p>

  <p>The crowning and most absurd instance of scientific intolerance&mdash;an
  intolerance which has always been as violent and unreasonable as that of the
  mediaeval Church&mdash;was shown by the American Scientific Association. This
  learned body howled down Professor Hare when he attempted to address them,
  and put it on record that the subject was unworthy of their attention. It was
  remarked, however, by the Spiritualists, that the same society at the same
  session held an animated debate as to why cocks crow between twelve and one
  at night, coming finally to the conclusion that at that particular hour a
  wave of electricity passes over the earth from north to south, and that the
  fowls, disturbed out of their slumbers and "being naturally of a crowing
  disposition," register the event in this fashion. It had not then been
  learned&mdash;and perhaps it has hardly been learned yet&mdash;that a man, or
  a body of men, may be very wise upon those subjects on which they are
  experts, and yet show an extraordinary want of common sense when faced with a
  new proposition which calls for a complete readjustment of ideas. British
  science and, indeed, science the whole world over, have shown the same
  intolerance and want of elasticity which marked those early days in
  America.</p>

  <p>These days have been drawn so fully by Mrs. Hardinge Britten, who herself
  played a large part in them, that those who are interested can always follow
  them in her pages. Some notes about Mrs. Britten herself may, however, be
  fitly introduced at this place, for no history of Spiritualism could be
  complete without an account of this remarkable woman who has been called the
  female St. Paul of the movement. She was a young Englishwoman who had gone to
  New York with a theatrical company, and had then, with her mother, remained
  in America. Being strictly Evangelical she was much repelled by what she
  considered the unorthodox views of Spiritualists, and fled in horror from her
  first séance. Later, in 1856, she was again brought into contact with the
  subject and received proofs which made it impossible for her to doubt its
  truth. She soon discovered that she was herself a powerful medium, and one of
  the best attested and most sensational cases in the early history of the
  movement was that in which she received intimation that the mail steamer
  <i>Pacific</i> had gone down in mid-Atlantic with all souls, and was
  threatened with prosecution by the owners of the boat for repeating what had
  been told her by the returning spirit of one of the crew. The information
  proved to be only too true, and the vessel was never heard of again.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Emma Hardinge&mdash;who became, by a second marriage, Mrs. Hardinge
  Britten&mdash;threw her whole enthusiastic temperament into the young
  movement and left a mark upon it which is still visible. She was an ideal
  propagandist, for she combined every gift. She was a strong medium, an
  orator, a writer, a well-balanced thinker and a hardy traveller. Year after
  year she travelled the length and breadth of the United States proclaiming
  the new doctrine amid much opposition, for she was militant and
  anti-Christian in the views which she professed to get straight from her
  spirit guides. As these views were, however, that the morals of the Churches
  were far too lax and that a higher standard was called for, it is not likely
  that the Founder of Christianity would have been among her critics. These
  opinions of Mrs. Hardinge Britten had more to do with the broadly Unitarian
  view of the official Spiritualist bodies, which still exists, than any other
  cause.</p>

  <p>In 1866 she returned to England, where she worked indefatigably, producing
  her two great chronicles, "Modern American Spiritualism" and, later,
  "Nineteenth Century Miracles," both of which show an amazing amount of
  research together with a very clear and logical mind. In 1870 she married Dr.
  Britten, as strong a Spiritualist as herself. The marriage seems to have been
  an ideally happy one. In 1878 they went together as missionaries for
  Spiritualism to Australia and New Zealand, and stayed there for several
  years, founding various churches and societies which the author found still
  holding their own when he visited the Antipodes forty years later upon the
  same errand. While in Australia she wrote her "Faiths, Facts and Frauds of
  Religious History," a book which still influences many minds. There was at
  that time undoubtedly a close connexion between the free thought movement and
  the new spirit revelation. The Hon. Robert Stout, Attorney-General of New
  Zealand, was both President of the Free Thought Association and an ardent
  Spiritualist. It is more clearly understood now, however, that spirit
  intercourse and teaching are too wide to be fitted into any system, whether
  negative or positive, and that it is possible for a Spiritualist to profess
  any creed so long as he has the essentials of reverence to the unseen and
  unselfishness to those around him.</p>

  <p>Among other monuments of her energy, Mrs. Hardinge Britten founded <i>The
  Two Worlds</i> of Manchester, which has still as large a circulation as any
  Spiritualistic paper in the world. She passed onwards in 1899, having left
  her mark deep upon the religious life of three continents.</p>

  <p>This has been a long but necessary digression from the account of the
  early days of American progress. Those early days were marked by great
  enthusiasm, much success, and also considerable persecution. All the leaders
  who had anything to lose lost it. Mrs. Hardinge says:</p>

  <p class="quote">Judge Edmonds was pointed at in the streets as a crazy
Spiritualist.
  Wealthy merchants were compelled to assert their claims to be considered sane
  and maintain their commercial rights by the most firm and determined action.
  Professional men and tradesmen were reduced to the limits of ruin, and a
  relentless persecution, originated by the Press and maintained by the pulpit,
  directed the full flow of its evil tides against the cause and its
  representatives. Many of the houses where circles were being held were
  disturbed by crowds who would gather together after nightfall and with yells,
  cries, whistles and occasional breaking of windows try to molest the quiet
  investigators in their unholy work of "waking the dead," as one of the papers
  piously denominated the act of seeking for the "Ministry of Angels."</p>

  <p>Passing the smaller ebb and flow of the movement, the rising of new true
  mediums, the exposure of occasional false ones, the committees of inquiry
  (negatived often by the want of perception of the inquirers that a psychic
  circle depends for success upon the psychic condition of <i>all</i> its
members),
  the development of fresh phenomena and the conversion of new initiates, there
  are a few outstanding incidents of those early days which should be
  particularly noted. Prominent among them is the mediumship of D.D. Home, and
  of the two Davenport boys, which form such important episodes, and attracted
  public attention to such a degree and for so long a time, that they are
  treated in separate chapters. There are, however, certain lesser mediumships
  which call for a shorter notice.</p>

  <p>One of these was that of Linton, the blacksmith, a man who was quite
  illiterate and yet, like A. J. Davis, wrote a remarkable book under alleged
  spirit control. This book of 530 pages, called "The Healing of the Nations,"
  is certainly a remarkable production whatever its source, and it is obviously
  impossible that it could have been normally produced by such an author. It is
  adorned by a very long preface from the pen of Governor Tallmadge, which
  shows that the worthy senator was no mean student of antiquity. The case from
  the point of view of the classics and the early Church has seldom been better
  stated.</p>

  <p>In 1857 Harvard University again made itself notorious by the persecution
  and expulsion of a student named Fred Willis, for the practice of medium
  ship. It would almost seem that the spirit of Cotton Mather and the old
  witch-finders of Salem had descended upon the great Boston seat of learning,
  for in those early days it was constantly at issue with those unseen forces
  which no one can hope to conquer. This matter began by an intemperate attempt
  upon the part of a Professor Eustis to prove that Willis was fraudulent,
  whereas all the evidence shows clearly that he was a true sensitive, who
  shrank greatly from any public use of his powers. The matter caused
  considerable excitement and scandal at the time. This and other cases of hard
  usage may be cited, but it must nevertheless be acknowledged that the hope of
  gain on the one hand, and the mental effervescence caused by so terrific a
  revelation on the other, did at this period lead to a degree of dishonesty in
  some so-called mediums, and to fanatical excesses and grotesque assertions in
  others, which held back that immediate success which the more sane and steady
  Spiritualists expected and deserved.</p>

  <p>One curious phase of mediumship which attracted much attention was that of
  a farmer, Jonathan Koons and his family, living in a wild district of Ohio.
  The phenomena obtained by the Eddy brothers are discussed at some length in a
  subsequent chapter, and as those of the Koons family were much on the same
  lines they need not be treated in detail. The use of musical instruments came
  largely into the demonstrations of spirit force, and the Koons's log-house
  became celebrated through all the adjoining states&mdash;so celebrated that
  it was constantly crowded, although it was situated some seventy miles from
  the nearest town. It would appear to have been a case of true physical
  mediumship of a crude quality, as might be expected where a rude uncultured
  farmer was the physical centre of it. Many investigations were held, but the
  facts always remained untouched by criticism. Eventually, however, Koons and
  his family were driven from their home by the persecution of the ignorant
  people among whom they lived. The rude open-air life of the farmer seems to
  be particularly adapted to the development of strong physical mediumship. It
  was in an American farmer's household that it first developed, and Koons in
  Ohio, the Eddys in Vermont, Foss in Massachusetts, and many others, have
  shown the same powers.</p>

  <p>We may fitly end this short review of the early days in America by an
  event where spirit intervention proved to be of importance in the world's
  history. This was the instance of the inspired messages which determined the
  action of Abraham Lincoln at the supreme moment of the Civil War. The facts
  are beyond dispute, and are given with the corroborative evidence in Mrs.
  Maynard's book on Abraham Lincoln. Mrs. Maynard's maiden name was Nettie
  Colburn, and she was herself the heroine of the story.</p>

  <p>The young lady was a powerful trance medium, and she visited Washington in
  the winter of 1862 in order to see her brother who was in the hospital of the
  Federal Army. Mrs. Lincoln, the wife of the President, who was interested in
  Spiritualism, had a sitting with Miss Colburn, was enormously impressed by
  the result, and sent a carriage next day to bring the medium to see the
  President. She describes the kindly way in which the great man received her
  in the parlour of the White House, and mentions the names of those who were
  present. She sat down, passed into the usual trance, and remembered no more.
  She continued thus:</p>

  <p class="quote">For more than an hour I was made to talk to him, and I
learned from my
  friends afterwards that it was upon matters that he seemed fully to
  understand, while they comprehended very little until that portion was
  reached that related to the forthcoming Emancipation Proclamation. He was
  charged with the utmost solemnity and force of manner not to abate the terms
  of its issue and not to delay its enforcement as a law beyond the opening of
  the year; and he was assured that it was to be the crowning event of his
  administration and his life; and that while he was being counselled by strong
  parties to defer the enforcement of it, hoping to supplant it by other
  measures and to delay action, he must in no wise heed such counsel, but stand
  firm to his convictions and fearlessly perform the work and fulfil the
  mission for which he had been raised up by an overruling Providence. Those
  present declared that they lost sight of the timid girl in the majesty of the
  utterance, the strength and force of the language, and the importance of that
  which was conveyed, and seemed to realize that some strong masculine spirit
  force was giving speech to almost divine commands.</p>

  <p class="quote">I shall never forget the scene around me when I regained
consciousness. I
  was standing in front of Mr. Lincoln, and he was sitting back in his chair,
  with his arms folded upon his breast, looking intently at me. I stepped back,
  naturally confused at the situation&mdash;not remembering at once where I
  was; and glancing around the group where perfect silence reigned. It took me
  a moment to remember my whereabouts.</p>

  <p class="quote">A gentleman present then said in a low tone, "Mr.
President, did you
  notice anything peculiar in the method of address?" Mr. Lincoln raised
  himself, as if shaking off his spell. He glanced quickly at the full-length
  portrait of Daniel Webster that hung above the piano, and replied: "Yes, and
  it is very singular, very!" with a marked emphasis.</p>

  <p class="quote">Mr. Somes said: "Mr. President, would it be improper for me
to inquire
  whether there has been any pressure brought to bear upon you to defer the
  enforcement of the Proclamation?" To which the President replied "Under these
  circumstances that question is perfectly proper, as we are all friends."
  (Smiling upon the company). "It is taking all my nerve and strength to
  withstand such a pressure." At this point the gentlemen drew around him and
  spoke together in low tones, Mr. Lincoln saying least of all. At last he
  turned to me, and laying his hand upon my head, uttered these words in a
  manner I shall never forget. "My child, you possess a very singular gift, but
  that it is of God I have no doubt. I thank you for coming here to-night. It
  is more important than perhaps anyone present can understand. I must leave
  you all now, but I hope I shall see you again." He shook me kindly by the
  hand, bowed to the rest of the company, and was gone. We remained an hour
  longer, talking with Mrs. Lincoln and her friends, and then returned to
  Georgetown. Such was my first interview with Abraham Lincoln, and the memory
  of it is as clear and vivid as the evening on which it occurred.</p>

  <p>This was one of the most important instances in the history of
  Spiritualism, and may also have been one of the most important in the history
  of the United States, as it not only strengthened the President in taking a
  step which raised the whole moral tone of the Northern armies and put
  something of the crusading spirit into the men, but a subsequent message
  urged Lincoln to visit the camps, which he did with the best effect upon the
  <i>morale</i> of the army. And yet the reader might, I fear, search every
history of
  the great struggle and every life of the President without finding a mention
  of this vital episode. It is all part of that unfair treatment which
  Spiritualism has endured so long.</p>

  <p>It is impossible that the United States, if it appreciated the truth,
  would allow the cult which proved its value at the darkest moment of its
  history to be persecuted and repressed by ignorant policemen and bigoted
  magistrates in the way which is now so common, or that the Press should
  continue to make mock of the movement which produced the Joan of Arc of their
  country.</p>

  <h2><a name="chap7"
     id="chap7">VII. &mdash; THE DAWN IN ENGLAND</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE early Spiritualists have frequently been compared with
  the early Christians, and there are indeed many points of resemblance. In one
  respect, however, the Spiritualists had an advantage. The women of the older
  dispensation did their part nobly, living as saints and dying as martyrs, but
  they did not figure as preachers and missionaries. Psychic power and psychic
  knowledge are, however, as great in one sex as in another, and therefore many
  of the great pioneers of the spiritual revelation were women. Especially may
  this be claimed for Emma Hardinge Britten, one whose name will grow more
  famous as the years roll by. There have, however, been several other women
  missionaries outstanding, and the most important of these from the British
  point of view is Mrs. Hayden, who first in the year 1852 brought the new
  phenomena to these shores. We had of old the Apostles of religious faith.
  Here at last was an apostle of religious fact.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Hayden was a remarkable woman as well as an excellent medium. She was
  the wife of a respectable New England journalist who accompanied her in her
  mission, which had been organized by one Stone, who had some experience of
  her powers in America.</p>

  <p>At the time of her visit she was described as being "young, intelligent,
  and at the same time simple and candid in her manners." Her British critic
  added:</p>

  <p class="quote">She disarmed suspicion by the unaffected artlessness of her
address, and
  many who came to amuse themselves at her expense were shamed into respect and
  even cordiality by the patience and good temper which she displayed. The
  impression invariably left by an interview with her was that if, as Mr.
  Dickens contended, the phenomena developed by her were attributed to art, she
  herself was the most perfect artist, as far as acting went, that had ever
  presented herself before the public.</p>

  <p>The ignorant British Press treated Mrs. Hayden as a common American
  adventuress. Her real mental calibre, however, may be judged from the fact
  that some years later, after her return to the United States, Mrs. Hayden
  graduated as a doctor of medicine and practised for fifteen years. Dr. James
  Rodes Buchanan, the famous pioneer in psychometry, speaks of her as "one of
  the most skilful and successful physicians I have ever known." She was
  offered a medical professorship in an American college, and was employed by
  the Globe Insurance Company in protecting the company against losses in
  insurance on lives. A feature of her success was what Buchanan describes as
  her psychometric genius. He adds a unique tribute to the effect that her name
  was almost forgotten at the Board of Health because for years she had not a
  single death to report.</p>

  <p>This sequel, however, was beyond the knowledge of the sceptics of 1852,
  and they cannot be blamed for insisting that these strange claims of
  other-world intervention should be tested with the utmost rigour before they
  could be admitted. No one could contest this critical attitude. But what does
  seem strange is that a proposition which, if true, would involve such glad
  tidings as the piercing of the wall of death and a true communion of the
  saints, should arouse not sober criticism, however exacting, but a storm of
  insult and abuse, inexcusable at any time, but particularly so when directed
  against a lady who was a visitor in our midst. Mrs. Hardinge Britten says
  that Mrs. Hayden no sooner appeared upon the scene than the leaders of the
  Press, pulpit and college levelled against her a storm of ribaldry,
  persecution and insult, alike disgraceful to themselves and humiliating to
  the boasted liberalism and scientific acumen of their age. She added that her
  gentle womanly spirit must have been deeply pained, and the harmony of mind
  so essential to the production of good psychological results constantly
  destroyed, by the cruel and insulting treatment she received at the hands of
  many of those who came, pretending to be investigators, but in reality
  burning to thwart her, and laying traps to falsify the truths of which Mrs.
  Hayden professed to be the instrument. Sensitively alive to the animus of her
  visitors, she could feel, and often writhed under the crushing force of the
  antagonism brought to bear upon her, without&mdash;at that time &mdash;
  knowing how to repel or resist it.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the whole nation was not involved in this irrational
  hostility, which in a diluted form we still see around us. Brave men arose
  who were not afraid to imperil their worldly career, or even their reputation
  for sanity, by championing an unpopular cause with no possible motive save
  the love of truth and that sense of chivalry which revolted at the
  persecution of a woman. Dr. Ashburner, one of the Royal physicians, and Sir
  Charles Isham, were among those who defended the medium in the public
  Press.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Hayden's mediumship seems, when judged by modern standards, to have
  been strictly limited in type. Save for the raps, we hear little of physical
  phenomena, nor is there any question of lights, materializations or Direct
  Voices. In harmonious company, however, the answers as furnished by raps were
  very accurate and convincing. Like all true mediums, she was sensitive to
  discord in her surroundings, with the result that the contemptible crew of
  practical jokers and ill-natured researchers who visited her found her a
  ready victim. Deceit is repaid by deceit and the fool is answered according
  to his folly, though the intelligence behind the words seems to care little
  for the fact that the passive instrument employed may be held accountable for
  the answer. These pseudo-researchers filled the Press with their humorous
  accounts of how they had deceived the spirits, when as a fact they had rather
  deceived themselves. George Henry Lewes, afterwards consort of George Eliot,
  was one of these cynical investigators. He recounts with glee how he had
  asked the control in writing: "Is Mrs. Hayden an impostor?" to which the
  control rapped out: "Yes." Lewes was dishonest enough to quote this
  afterwards as being a confession of guilt from Mrs. Hayden. One would rather
  draw from it the inference that the raps were entirely independent of the
  medium, and also that questions asked in a spirit of pure frivolity met with
  no serious reply.</p>

  <p>It is, however, by the positives and not by the negatives that such
  questions must be judged, and the author must here use quotations to a larger
  extent than is his custom, for in no other way can one bring home how those
  seeds were first planted in England which are destined to grow to such a
  goodly height. Allusion has already been made to the testimony of Dr.
  Ashburner, the famous physician, and it would be well perhaps to add some of
  his actual words. He says*:</p>

  <p class="quote">Sex ought to have protected her from injury, if you
gentlemen of the Press
  have no regard to the hospitable feelings due to one of your own cloth, for
  Mrs. Hayden is the wife of a former editor and proprietor of a journal in
  Boston having a most extensive circulation in New England. I declare to you
  that Mrs. Hayden is no impostor, and he who has the daring to come to an
  opposite conclusion must do so at the peril of his character for truth.</p>

  <p class="footnote">* <i>The Leader</i>, March 14, 1853; June 1 and 8,
  1853.</p>

  <p>Again, in a long letter to <i>The Reasoner</i>, after admitting that he
  visited the medium in a thoroughly incredulous frame of mind, expecting to
  witness "the same class of transparent absurdities" he had previously
  encountered with other so-called mediums, Ashburner writes: "As for Mrs.
  Hayden, I have so strong a conviction of her perfect honesty that I marvel at
  anyone who could deliberately accuse her of fraud," and at the same time he
  gives detailed accounts of veridical communications he received.</p>

  <p>Among the investigators was the celebrated mathematician and philosopher,
  Professor De Morgan. He gives some account of his experiences and conclusions
  in his long and masterly preface to his wife's book, "From Matter to Spirit,"
  1863, as follows:</p>

  <p class="quote">Ten years ago Mrs. Hayden, the well-known American medium,
came to my
  house <i>alone</i>. The sitting began immediately after her arrival. Eight or
  nine persons of all ages, and of all degrees of belief and unbelief in the
  whole thing being imposture, were present. The raps began in the usual way.
  They were to my ear clean, clear, faint sounds such as would be said to ring,
  had they lasted. I likened them at the time to the noise which the ends of
  knitting-needles would make, if dropped from a small distance upon a marble
  slab, and instantly checked by a damper of some kind; and subsequent trial
  showed that my description was tolerably accurate . At a late period in the
  evening, after nearly three hours of experiment, Mrs. Hayden having risen,
  and talking at another table while taking refreshment, a child suddenly
  called out, "Will all the spirits who have been here this evening rap
  together?" The words were no sooner uttered than a hailstorm of
  knitting-needles was heard, crowded into certainly less than two seconds; the
  big needle sounds of the men, and the little ones of the women and children,
  being clearly distinguishable, but perfectly disorderly in their arrival.</p>

  <p>After a remark to the effect that for convenience he intends to speak of
  the raps as coming from spirits, Professor De Morgan goes on:</p>

  <p class="quote">On being asked to put a question to the first spirit, I
begged that I
  might be allowed to put my question mentally&mdash;that is, without speaking
  it, or writing it, or pointing it out to myself on an alphabet &mdash;and
  that Mrs. Hayden might hold both arms extended while the answer was in
  progress. Both demands were instantly granted by a couple of raps. I put the
  question and desired the answer might be in one word, which I assigned; all
  mentally.</p>

  <p class="quote">I then took the printed alphabet, put a book upright before
it, and,
  bending my eyes upon it, proceeded to point to the letters in the usual way.
  The word "chess" was given by a rap at each letter. I had now a reasonable
  certainty of the following alternative: either some thought-reading of a
  character wholly inexplicable, or such superhuman acuteness on the part of
  Mrs. Hayden that she could detect the letter I wanted by my bearing, though
  she (seated six feet from the book which hid my alphabet) could see neither
  my hand nor my eye, nor at what rate I was going through the letters. I was
  fated to be driven out of the second alternative before the sitting was
  done.</p>

  <p>As the next incident of the sitting, which he goes on to relate, is given
  with extra details in a letter written ten years earlier to the Rev. W.
  Heald, we quote this version published in his wife's "Memoir of Augustus De
  Morgan" (pp. 221-2):</p>

  <p class="quote">Presently came <i>my father</i> (OB., 1816), and after some
conversation I
  went on as follows:</p>

  <p class="quote">"Do you remember a periodical I have in my head?" "Yes."
"Do you remember
  the epithets therein applied to yourself?" "Yes." "Will you give me the
  initials of them by the card?" "Yes." I then began pointing to the alphabet,
  with a book to conceal the card, Mrs. H. being at the opposite side of a
  round table (large), and a bright lamp between us. I pointed letter by letter
  till I came to F, which I thought should be the first initial. No rapping.
  The people round me said, "You have passed it; there was a rapping at the
  beginning." I went back and heard the rapping distinctly at C. This puzzled
  me, but in a moment I saw what it was. The sentence was begun by the rapping
  agency earlier than I intended. I allowed C to pass, and then got D T F O C,
  being the initials of the consecutive words which I remembered to have been
  applied to my father in an old review published in 1817, which no one in the
  room had ever heard of but myself. C D T F O C was all right, and when I got
  so far I gave it up, perfectly satisfied that something, or somebody, or some
  spirit, was reading my thoughts. This and the like went on for nearly three
  hours, during a great part of which Mrs. H. was busy reading the "Key to
  Uncle Tom's Cabin," which she had never seen before, and I assure you she set
  to it with just as much avidity as you may suppose an American lady would who
  saw it for the first time, while we were amusing ourselves with the raps in
  our own way. All this I declare to be literally true. Since that time I have
  seen it in my house frequently, various persons presenting themselves. The
  answers are given mostly by the table, on which a hand or two is gently
  placed, tilting up at the letters. There is much which is confused in the
  answers, but every now and then comes something which surprises us. I have no
  theory about it, but in a year or two something curious may turn up. I am,
  however, satisfied of the reality of the phenomenon. A great many other
  persons are as cognizant of these phenomena in their own houses as myself.
  Make what you can of it if you are a philosopher.</p>

  <p>When Professor De Morgan says that some spirit was reading his thoughts,
  he omits to observe that the incident of the first letter was evidence of
  something that was not in his mind. Also, from Mrs. Hayden's attitude
  throughout the séance, it is clear that it was her atmosphere rather than her
  actual conscious personality which was concerned. Some further important
  evidence from the De Morgans is relegated to the Appendix.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Fitzgerald, a well-known figure in the early days of Spiritualism in
  London, gives, in <i>The Spiritualist</i> of November 22, 1878, the following
  very striking experience with Mrs. Hayden:</p>

  <p class="quote">My first introduction to Spiritualism commenced at the time
of the first
  visit of the well-known medium, Mrs. Hayden, to this country nearly thirty
  years ago. I was invited to meet her at a party given by a friend in Wimpole
  Street, London. Having made a pre-engagement for that evening, which I could
  not avoid, I arrived late, after what appeared an extraordinary scene, of
  which they were all talking with great animation. My look of blank
  disappointment was noticed, and Mrs. Hayden, whom I then met for the first
  time, came most kindly forward, expressed her regrets, and suggested that I
  should sit at a small table by myself apart from the others, and she would
  ask the spirits if they would communicate with me. All this appeared so new
  and surprising I scarcely understood what she was talking about, or what I
  had to expect. She placed before me a printed alphabet, a pencil, and a piece
  of paper. Whilst she was in the act of doing this, I felt extraordinarily
  rappings all over the table, the vibrations from which I could feel on the
  sole of my foot as it rested against the table's leg. She then directed me to
  note down each letter at which I heard a distinct rap, and with this short
  explanation she left me to myself. I pointed as desired&mdash;a distinct rap
  came at the letter E&mdash;others followed, and a name that I could not fail
  to recognize was spelt out. The date of death was given, which I had not
  before known, and a message added which brought back to my memory the almost
  last dying words of an old friend&mdash;namely, "I shall watch over you." And
  then the recollection of the whole scene was brought vividly before me. I
  confess I was startled and somewhat awed.</p>

  <p class="quote">I carried the paper upon which all this was written at the
dictation of my
  spirit friend to his former legal adviser, and was assured by him that the
  dates, etc., were perfectly correct. They could not have been in my mind
  because I was not aware of them.</p>

  <p>It is interesting to note that Mrs. Fitzgerald stated that she believed
  that Mrs. Hayden's first séance in England was held with Lady Combermere, her
  son, Major Cotton, and Mr. Henry Thompson, of York.</p>

  <p>In the same volume of <i>The Spiritualist</i> (p. 264) there appears an
  account of a séance with Mrs. Hayden, taken from the life of Charles Young,
  the well-known tragedian, written by his son, the Rev. Julian Young:</p>

  <p class="quote">1853, <i>April</i> 19th. I went up to London this day for
the purpose of
  consulting my lawyers on a subject of some importance to myself, and having
  heard much of a Mrs. Hayden, an American lady, as a spiritual medium, I
  resolved, as I was in town, to discover her whereabouts, and judge of her
  gifts for myself. Accidentally meeting an old friend, Mr. H., I asked him if
  he could give me her address. He told me that it was 22, Queen Anne Street,
  Cavendish Square. As he had never been in her company, and had a great wish
  to see her, and yet was unwilling to pay his guinea for the treat, I offered
  to frank him, if he would go with me. He did so gladly. Spirit-rapping has
  been so common since 1853 that I should irritate my reader's patience by
  describing the conventional mode of communicating between the living and the
  dead. Since the above date I have seen very much of spirit-rapping; and
  though my organs of wonder are largely developed, and I have a weakness for
  the mystic and supernatural, yet I cannot say that I have ever witnessed any
  spiritual phenomena which were not explicable on natural grounds, except in
  the instance I am about to give, in which collusion appeared to be out of the
  question, the friend who accompanied me never having seen Mrs. Hayden, and
  she knowing neither his name nor mine. The following dialogue took place
  between Mrs. H. and myself:</p>

  <p class="quote">Mrs. H.: Have you, sir, any wish to communicate with the
spirit of any
  departed friend?</p>

  <p class="quote">J. C. Y.: Yes.</p>

  <p class="quote">Mrs. H.: Be pleased then to ask your questions in the
manner prescribed by
  the formula, and I dare say you will get satisfactory replies.</p>

  <p class="quote">J. C. Y.: (Addressing himself to one invisible yet supposed
to be
  present): Tell me the name of the person with whom I wish to communicate.</p>

  <p class="quote">The letters written down according to the dictation of the
taps when put
  together spelt "George William Young."</p>

  <p class="quote">J. C. Y.: On whom are my thoughts now fixed?</p>

  <p class="quote">A.: Frederick William Young.</p>

  <p class="quote">J. C. Y.: What is he suffering from?</p>

  <p class="quote">A.: Tic douloureux.</p>

  <p class="quote">J. C. Y.: Can you prescribe anything for him?</p>

  <p class="quote">A.: Powerful mesmerism.</p>

  <p class="quote">J. C. Y.: Who should be the administrator?</p>

  <p class="quote">A.: Someone who has strong sympathy with the patient.</p>

  <p class="quote">J. C. Y.: Should I succeed?</p>

  <p class="quote">A.: No.</p>

  <p class="quote">J. C. Y.: Who would?</p>

  <p class="quote">A.: Joseph Ries. (A gentleman whom my uncle much
respected.)</p>

  <p class="quote">J. C. Y.: Have I lost any friend lately?</p>

  <p class="quote">A.: Yes.</p>

  <p class="quote">J. C. Y.: Who is it? (I thinking of a Miss Young, a distant
cousin.)</p>

  <p class="quote">A.: Christiana Lane.</p>

  <p class="quote">J. C. Y.: Can you tell me where I sleep to-night?</p>

  <p class="quote">A.: James B.'s, Esq., 9 Clarges Street.</p>

  <p class="quote">J. C. Y.: Where do I sleep to-morrow?</p>

  <p class="quote">A.: Colonel Weymouth's, Upper Grosvenor Street.</p>

  <p class="quote">I was so astounded by the correctness of the answers I
received to my
  inquiries that I told the gentleman who was with me that I wanted
  particularly to ask a question to the nature of which I did not wish him to
  be privy, and that I should be obliged to him if he would go into the
  adjoining room for a few minutes. On his doing so I resumed my dialogue with
  Mrs. Hayden.</p>

  <p class="quote">J. C. Y.: I have induced my friend to withdraw because I
did not wish him
  to know the question I want to put, but I am equally anxious that you should
  not know it either, and yet, if I understand rightly, no answer can be
  transmitted to me except through you. What is to be done under these
  circumstances?</p>

  <p class="quote">Mrs. H.: Ask your question in such a form that the answer
returned shall
  represent by one word the salient idea in your mind.</p>

  <p class="quote">J. C. Y.: I will try. Will what I am threatened with take
place?</p>

  <p class="quote">A.: No.</p>

  <p class="quote">J. C. Y.: That is unsatisfactory. It is easy to say Yes or
No, but the
  value of the affirmation or negation will depend on the conviction I have
  that you know what I am thinking of. Give me one word which shall show that
  you have the clue to my thoughts.</p>

  <p class="quote">A.: Will.</p>

  <p class="quote">Now, a will by which I had benefited was threatened to be
disputed. I
  wished to know whether the threat would be carried out. The answer I received
  was correct.</p>

  <p>It may be added that Mr. Young had no belief, before or after this séance,
  in spirit agency, which surely, after such an experience, is no credit to his
  intelligence or capacity for assimilating fresh knowledge.</p>

  <p>The following letter in <i>The Spiritualist</i> from Mr. John Malcom, of
  Clifton, Bristol, mentions some well-known sitters. Discussing the question
  that had been raised as to where the first séance in England was held and who
  were the witnesses present at it, he says:</p>

  <p class="quote">I do not remember the date; but calling on my friend Mrs.
Crowe, authoress
  of "The Night Side of Nature," she invited me to accompany her to a spiritual
  séance at the house of Mrs. Hayden in Queen Anne Street, Cavendish Square.
  She informed me that Mrs. Hayden had just arrived from America to exhibit the
  phenomena of Spiritualism to people in England who might feel interested in
  the subject. There were present Mrs. Crowe, Mrs. Milner Gibson, Mr. Colley
  Grattan (author of "High Ways and Bye Ways"), Mr. Robert Chambers, Dr.
  Daniels, Dr. Samuel Dickson, and several others whose names I did not hear.
  Some very remarkable manifestations occurred on that occasion. I afterwards
  had frequent opportunities of visiting Mrs. Hayden, and, though at first
  disposed to doubt the genuineness of the phenomena, such convincing evidence
  was given me of spirit communion that I became a firm believer in the truth
  of it.</p>

  <p>The battle in the British Press raged furiously. In the columns of <i>The
  London Critic</i>, Mr. Henry Spicer (author of "Sights and Sounds") replied
  to the critics in <i>Household Words</i>, <i>The Leader</i>, and <i>The
  Zoist</i>. There followed in the same newspaper a lengthy contribution from a
  Cambridge clergyman, signing himself "M.A.," considered to be the Rev. A. W.
  Hobson, of St. John's College, Cambridge.</p>

  <p>This gentleman's description is graphic and powerful, but too long for
  complete transcription. The matter is of some importance, as the writer is,
  so far as is known, the first English clergyman who had gone into the matter.
  It is strange, and perhaps characteristic of the age, how little the
  religious implications appear to have struck the various sitters, and how
  entirely occupied they were by inquiries as to their grandmother's second
  name or the number of their uncles. Even the more earnest seem to have been
  futile in their questions, and no one shows the least sense of realization of
  the real possibilities of such commerce, or that a firm foundation for
  religious belief could at last be laid. This clergyman did, however, in a
  purblind way, see that there was a religious side to the matter. He finishes
  his report with the paragraph:</p>

  <p class="quote">I will conclude with a few words to the numerous clerical
readers of the
  <i>Critic</i>. Being myself a clergyman of the Church of England, I consider
that
  the subject is one in which my brother clergy must, sooner or later, take
  some interest, however reluctant they may be to have anything to do with it.
  And my reasons are briefly as follow: If such excitement become general in
  this country as already exists in America&mdash;and what reason have we to
  suppose that it will not?&mdash;then the clergy throughout the kingdom will
  be appealed to on all sides, will have to give an opinion, and may probably
  be obliged, by their very duties, to interfere and endeavour to prevent the
  delusions to which, in many cases, this "mystery" has already led. One of the
  most sensible and able writers on the subject of these spirit manifestations
  in America, viz., Adin Ballou, in his work has expressly cautioned his
  readers not to believe all these spirits communicate, nor allow themselves to
  give up their former opinions and religious creeds (as so many thousands have
  done) at the bidding of these rappers. The thing has scarcely begun in
  England as yet; but already, within the few months since Mr. and Mrs. Hayden
  arrived in London, it has spread like wild-fire, and I have good reason for
  saying that the excitement is only commencing. Persons who at first treated
  the whole affair as a contemptible imposture and humbug, on witnessing these
  strange things for themselves, become first startled and astonished, then
  rush blindly into all sorts of mad conclusions&mdash;as, for instance, that
  it is all the work of the devil, or (in the opposite degree) that it is a new
  revelation from Heaven. I see scores of the most able and intelligent people
  whom I know utterly and completely mystified by it; and no one knows what to
  make of it. I am ready to confess, for my own part, that I am equally
  mystified. That it is not imposture, I feel perfectly and fully convinced. In
  addition to the tests, etc., above-named, I had a long conversation in
  private with both Mr. and Mrs. Hayden separately, and everything they said
  bore the marks of sincerity and good faith. Of course, this is no evidence to
  other people, but it is to me. If there is any deception, they are as much
  deceived as any of their dupes.</p>

  <p>It was not the clergy but the Free Thinkers who perceived the real meaning
  of the message, and that they must either fight against this proof of life
  eternal, or must honestly confess, as so many of us have done since, that
  their philosophy was shattered, and that they had been beaten on their own
  ground. These men had called for proofs in transcendent matters, and the more
  honest and earnest were forced to admit that they had had them. The noblest
  of them all was Robert Owen, as famous for his humanitarian works as for his
  sturdy independence in religious matters. This brave and honest man declared
  publicly that the first rays of this rising sun had struck him and had gilded
  the drab future which he had pictured. He said:</p>

  <p class="quote">I have patiently traced the history of these
manifestations, investigated
  the facts connected with them (testified to in innumerable instances by
  persons of high character), have had fourteen séances with the medium Mrs.
  Hayden, during which she gave me every opportunity to ascertain if it were
  possible there could be any deception on her part.</p>

  <p>I am not only convinced that there is no deception with truthful media in
  these proceedings, but that they are destined to effect, at this period, the
  greatest class="quote" moral revolution in the character and condition of
the human
  race.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Emma Hardinge Britten comments on the interest and astonishment
  created by the conversion of Robert Owen, the influence of whose purely
  materialistic belief was regarded as exerting an injurious effect on
  religion. She says that one of England's most prominent statesmen declared
  "that Mrs. Hayden deserved a monument, if only for the conversion of Robert
  Owen."</p>

  <p>Shortly afterwards the famous Dr. Elliotson, who was the president of the
  Secular Society, was also converted after, like St. Paul, violently assailing
  the new revelation. He and Dr. Ashburner had been two of the most prominent
  supporters of mesmerism in the days when even that obvious phenomenon had to
  fight for its existence, and when every medical man who affirmed it was in
  danger of being called a quack. It was painful to both of them, therefore,
  when Dr. Ashburner threw himself into this higher subject with enthusiasm,
  while his friend was constrained not only to reject but actively to attack
  it. However, the breach was healed by the complete conversion of Elliotson,
  and Mrs. Hardinge Britten relates how in his declining years he insisted upon
  her coming to him, and how she found him a "warm adherent of Spiritualism, a
  faith which the venerable gentleman cherished as the brightest revelation
  that had ever been vouchsafed to him, and one which finally smoothed the dark
  passage to the life beyond, and made his transition a scene of triumphant
  faith and joyful anticipation."</p>

  <p>As might have been expected, it was not long before the rapid growth of
  table phenomena compelled scientific sceptics to recognize their existence,
  or at least to take steps to expose the delusion of those who attributed to
  the movements an external origin. Braid, Carpenter, and Faraday stated
  publicly that the results obtained were due simply to unconscious muscular
  action. Faraday devised ingenious apparatus which he considered conclusively
  proved his assertion. But, like so many other critics, Faraday had had no
  experience with a good medium, and the well-attested fact of the movement of
  tables without contact is sufficient to demolish his pretty theories. If one
  could imagine a layman without a telescope contradicting with jeers and
  contempt the conclusions of those astronomers who had used telescopes, it
  would present some analogy to those people who have ventured to criticize
  psychic matters without having had any personal psychic experience.</p>

  <p>The contemporary spirit is no doubt voiced by Sir David Brewster. Speaking
  of an invitation from Monckton Milnes to meet Mr. Galla, the African
  traveller, "who assured him that Mrs. Hayden told him the names of persons
  and places in Africa which nobody but himself knew," Sir David comments, "The
  world is obviously going mad."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Hayden remained in England about a year, returning to America towards
  the close of 1853. Some day, when these matters have found their true
  proportion to other events, her visit will be regarded as historical and
  epoch-making. Two other American mediums were in England during her visit
  &mdash;Mrs. Roberts and Miss Jay&mdash;having followed shortly after, but
  they appear to have had little influence on the movement, and seem to have
  been very inferior in psychic power.</p>

  <p>A contemporary sidelight on those early days is afforded by this extract
  from an article on Spiritualism in <i>The Yorkshireman</i> (October 25,
  1856), a non-Spiritualist journal:</p>

  <p class="quote">The English public in general, we believe, are but
imperfectly acquainted
  with the nature of the Spiritualist doctrines, and many of our readers are,
  doubtless, unprepared to believe that they prevail to any extent in this
  country. The ordinary phenomena of table-moving, etc., are, it is true,
  familiar to most of us. Some two or three years ago there was not an evening
  party which did not essay the performance of a Spiritualist miracle . In
  those days you were invited to "Tea and Table Moving" as a new excitement,
  and made to revolve with the family like mad round articles of furniture.</p>

  <p>After declaring that Faraday's attack made "the spirits suddenly subside,"
  so that for a time no more was heard of their doings, the journal
  continues:</p>

  <p class="quote">We have ample evidence, however, that Spiritualism as a
vital and active
  belief is not confined to the United States, but that it has found favour and
  acceptance among a considerable class of enthusiasts in our own country.</p>

  <p>But the general attitude of the influential Press was much the same then
  as now&mdash;ridicule and denial of the facts, and the view that even if the
  facts were true, of what use were they? <i>The Times</i>, for instance (a
  paper which has been very ill-informed and reactionary in psychic matters),
  in a leading article of a little later date suggests:</p>

  <p class="quote">It would be something to get one's hat off the peg by an
effort of
  volition, without going to fetch it, or troubling a servant.</p>

  <p class="quote">If table-power could be made to turn even a coffee-mill, it
would be so
  much gained.</p>

  <p class="quote">Let our mediums and clairvoyants, instead of finding out
what somebody
  died of fifty years ago, find out what figure the Funds will be at this day
  three months.</p>

  <p>When one reads such comments in a great paper one wonders whether the
  movement was not really premature, and whether in so base and material an age
  the idea of outside intervention was not impossible to grasp. Much of this
  opposition was due, however, to the frivolity of inquirers who had not as yet
  realized the full significance of these signals from beyond, and used them,
  as the Yorkshire paper states, as a sort of social recreation and a new
  excitement for jaded worldlings.</p>

  <p>But while in the eyes of the Press the death-blow had been given to a
  discredited movement, investigation went on quietly in many quarters. People
  of common sense, as Howitt points out, "were successfully testing those
  angels, under their own mode of advent, and finding them real," for, as he
  well says, public mediums have never done more than inaugurate the
  movement."</p>

  <p>If one were to judge from the public testimony of the time, Mrs. Hayden's
  influence might be considered to have been limited in extent. To the public
  at large she was only a nine days' wonder, but she scattered much seed which
  slowly grew. The fact is, she opened the subject up, and people, mostly in
  the humbler walks of life, began to experiment and to discover the truth for
  themselves, though, with a caution born of experience, they kept their
  discoveries for the most part to themselves. Mrs. Hayden, without doubt,
  fulfilled her ordained task.</p>

  <p>The history of the movement may well be compared to an advancing sea with
  its successive crests and troughs, each crest gathering more volume than the
  last. With every trough the spectator has thought that the waves had ended,
  and then the great new billow gathered. The time between the leaving of Mrs.
  Hayden in 1853 until the advent of D.D. Home in 1855 represents the first
  lull in England. Superficial critics thought it was the end. But in a
  thousand homes throughout the land experiments were being carried on; many
  who had lost all faith in the things of the spirit, in what was perhaps the
  deadest and most material age in the world's history, had begun to examine
  the evidence and to understand with relief or with awe that the age of faith
  was passing and that the age of knowledge, which St. Peter has said to be
  better, was at hand. Devout students of the Scriptures remember the words of
  their Master: "I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear
  them now," and wondered whether these strange stirrings of outside forces
  might not be part of that new knowledge which had been promised.</p>

  <p>Whilst Mrs. Hayden had thus planted the first seeds in London, a second
  train of events had brought spiritual phenomena under the notice of the
  people of Yorkshire.</p>

  <p>This was due to a visit of a Mr. David Richmond, an American Shaker, to
  the town of Keighley, when he called upon Mr. David Weatherhead and
  interested him in the new development. Table manifestations were obtained and
  local mediums discovered, so that a flourishing centre was built up which
  still exists. From Yorkshire the movement spread over Lancashire, and it is
  an interesting link with the past that Mr. Wolstenholme, of Blackburn, who
  died in 1925 at a venerable age, was able as a boy to secrete himself under a
  table at one of these early séances, where he witnessed, though we will hope
  that he did not aid, the phenomena. A paper, <i>The Yorkshire Spiritual
  Telegraph</i>, was started at Keighley in 1855, this and other expenses being
  borne by David Weatherhead, whose name should be honoured as one who was the
  first to throw his whole heart into the movement. Keighley is still an active
  centre of psychic work and knowledge.</p>

  <h2><a name="chap8"
     id="chap8">VIII. &mdash; CONTINUED PROGRESS IN ENGLAND</a></h2>

  <p class="first">MRS. DE MORGAN'S account of ten years' experience of
  Spiritualism covers the ground from 1853 to 1863. The appearance of this
  book, with the weighty preface by Professor De Morgan, was one of the first
  signs that the new movement was spreading upwards as well as among the
  masses. Then came the work of D.D. Home and of the Davenports, which is
  detailed elsewhere. The examination of the Dialectical Society began in 1869,
  which is also dealt with in a later chapter. The year 1870 was the date of
  the first researches of William Crookes, which he undertook after remarking
  upon the scandal caused by the refusal of scientific men "to investigate the
  existence and nature of facts asserted by so many competent and credible
  witnesses." In the same periodical, the Quarterly journal of Science, he
  spoke of this belief being shared by millions, and added: "I wish to
  ascertain the laws governing the appearance of very remarkable phenomena,
  which, at the present time, are occurring to an almost incredible
  extent."</p>

  <p>The story of his research was given in full in 1874, and caused such a
  tumult among the more fossilized men of science&mdash;those who may be said
  to have had their minds subdued to that at which they worked&mdash;that there
  was some talk of depriving him of his Fellowship of the Royal Society. The
  storm blew over, but Crookes was startled by its violence, and it was
  noticeable that for many years, until his position was impregnable, he was
  very cautious in any public expression of his views. In 1872-73, the Rev.
  Stainton Moses appeared as a new factor, and his automatic writings raised
  the subject to a more spiritual plane in the judgment of many. The phenomenal
  side may attract the curious, but when over-emphasized it is likely to repel
  the judicious mind.</p>

  <p>Public lectures and trance addresses became a feature. Mrs. Emma Hardinge
  Britten, Mrs. Cora L. V. Tappan, and Mr. J. J. Morse gave eloquent orations,
  purporting to come from spirit influence, and large gatherings were deeply
  interested. Mr. Gerald Massey, the well-known poet and writer, and Dr. George
  Sexton, also delivered public lectures. Altogether, Spiritualism had much
  publicity given to it.</p>

  <p>The establishment of the British National Association of Spiritualists in
  1873 gave the movement an impetus, because many well-known public men and
  women joined it. Among them may be mentioned the Countess of Caithness, Mrs.
  Makdougall Gregory (widow of Professor Gregory, of Edinburgh), Dr. Stanhope
  Speer, Dr. Gully, Sir Charles Isham, Dr. Maurice Davies, Mr. H. D. Jencken,
  Dr. George Sexton, Mrs. Ross Church (Florence Marryat), Mr. Newton Crosland,
  and Mr. Benjamin Coleman.</p>

  <p>Mediumship of a high order in the department of physical phenomena was
  supplied by Mrs. Jencken (Kate Fox) and Miss Florence Cook. Dr. J. R. Newton,
  the famous healing medium from America, arrived in 1870, and numbers of
  extraordinary cures were registered at free treatments. From 1870 Mrs.
  Everitt's wonderful mediumship exercised, like that of D.D. Home, without
  charge, convinced many influential people. Herne and Williams, Mrs. Guppy,
  Eglinton, Slade, Lottie Fowler, and others, secured many converts through
  their mediumship. In 1872 Hudson's spirit photographs created enormous
  interest, and in 1875 Dr. Alfred Russel Wallace published his famous book,
  "On Miracles and Modern Spiritualism."</p>

  <p>A good means of tracing the growth of Spiritualism at this period is to
  examine the statements of worthy contemporary witnesses, especially those
  qualified by position and experience to give an opinion. But before we glance
  at the period we are considering, let us look at the situation in 1866, as
  viewed by Mr. William Howitt in a few paragraphs which are so admirable that
  the author is constrained to quote thetas verbatim. He says:</p>

  <p class="quote">The present position of Spiritualism in England, were the
Press, with all
  its influence, omnipotent, would be hopeless. After having taken every
  possible means to damage and sneer down Spiritualism; after having opened its
  columns to it, in the hope that its emptiness and folly would be so apparent
  that its clever enemies would soon be able to knock it on the head by
  invincible arguments, and then finding that all the advantages of reason and
  fact were on its side; after having abused and maligned it to no purpose, the
  whole Press as by one consent, or by one settled plan, has adopted the system
  of opening its columns and pages to any false or foolish story about it, and
  hermetically closing them to any explanation, refutation, or defence. It is,
  in fact, resolved, all other means of killing it having failed, to burke it.
  To clap a literary pitch-plaster on its mouth, and then let anyone that likes
  cut its throat if he can. By this means it hopes to stamp it out like the
  rinderpest....</p>

  <p class="quote">If anything could annihilate Spiritualism, its present
estimation by the
  English public, its treatment by the Press and the courts of law, its
  attempted suppression by all the powers of public intelligence, its hatred by
  the heroes of the pulpits of all churches and creeds, the simple acceptance
  of even the public folly and wickedness attributed to it by the Press, its
  own internal divisions&mdash;in a word, its pre-eminent unpopularity would
  put it out of existence. But does it? On the contrary, it never was more
  firmly rooted into the mass of advanced minds; its numbers never more rapidly
  increased; its truths were never more earnestly and eloquently advocated; the
  enquiries after it never more abundant or more anxious. The soirees in Harley
  Street have, through the whole time that Press and horsehair wig have been
  heaping every reproach and every scorn upon it, been crowded to excess by
  ladies and gentlemen of the middle and higher classes, who have listened in
  admiration to the eloquent and ever-varied addresses of Emma Hardinge.
  Meantime, the Davenports, a thousand times denounced as impostors, and
  exposed impostors, have a thousand times shown that their phenomena remain as
  unexplainable as ever on any but a spiritual theory.</p>

  <p class="quote">What means all this? What does it indicate? That Press and
pulpit, and
  magistrate and law courts, have all tried their powers, and have failed. They
  stand nonplussed before the thing which they themselves have protested is
  poor and foolish and false and unsubstantial. If it be so poor and foolish
  and false and unsubstantial, how is it that all their learning, their
  unscrupulous denunciation, their vast means of attack and their not less
  means of prevention of fair defence, their command of the ears and the
  opinions of the multitude&mdash;how happens it that all their wit and sarcasm
  and logic and eloquence cannot touch it? So far from shaking and diminishing
  it, they do not even ruffle a hair on its head, or a fringe of its robe.</p>

  <p class="quote">Is it not about time for these combined hosts of the great
and wise, the
  scientific, the learned, the leaders of senates and colleges and courts of
  law, the eloquent favourites of Parliament, the magnates of the popular
  Press, furnished with all the intellectual artillery which a great national
  system of education, and great national system of Church and State and
  aristocracy, accustomed to proclaim what shall be held to be true and of
  honourable repute by all honourable men and women&mdash;is it not time, I
  say, that all this great and splendid world of wit and wisdom should begin to
  suspect that they have something solid to deal with? That there is something
  vital in what they have treated as a phantom?</p>

  <p class="quote">I do not say to these great and world-commanding bodies,
powers and
  agencies, open your eyes and see that your efforts are fruitless, and
  acknowledge your defeat, for probably they never will open their eyes and
  confess their shame; but I say to the Spiritualists themselves, dark as the
  day may seem to you, never was it more cheering. Leagued as all the armies of
  public instructors and directors are against it, never was its bearing more
  anticipatory of ultimate victory. It has upon it the stamp of all the
  conquering influences of the age. It has all the legitimatism of history on
  its head. It is but fighting the battle that every great reform &mdash;
  social or moral or intellectual or religious&mdash;has fought and eventually
  won.</p>

  <p>As showing the change that occurred after Mr. Howitt wrote in 1866, we
  find <i>The Times</i> of December 26, 1872, publishing an article entitled
  "Spiritualism and Science," occupying three and a half columns, in which the
  opinion is expressed that now "it is high time competent hands undertook the
  unravelling of this Gordian Knot," though why the existing hands of Crookes,
  Wallace or De Morgan were incompetent is not explained.</p>

  <p>The writer, speaking of Lord Adare's little book (privately printed) on
  his experiences with D.D. Home, seems to be impressed by the social status of
  the various witnesses. Clumsy humour and snobbishness are the characteristics
  of the article:</p>

  <p class="quote">A volume now lying before us may serve to show how this
folly has spread
  throughout society. It was lent to us by a disinguished Spiritualist, under
  the solemn promise that we should not divulge a single name of those
  concerned. It consists of about 150 pages of reports of séances, and was
  privately printed by a noble Earl, who has lately passed beyond the House of
  Lords; beyond also, we trust, the spirit-peopled chairs and tables which in
  his lifetime he loved, not wisely, but too well. In this book things more
  marvellous than any we have set down are circumstantially related, in a
  natural way, just as though they were ordinary, everyday matters of fact. We
  shall not fatigue the reader by quoting any of the accounts given, and no
  doubt he will take our word when we say that they range through every species
  of "manifestation," from prophesyings downwards.</p>

  <p class="quote">What we more particularly wish to observe is, that the
attestation of
  fifty respectable witnesses is placed before the title-page. Among them are a
  Dowager Duchess and other ladies of rank, a Captain in the Guards, a
  nobleman, a Baronet, a Member of Parliament, several officers of our
  scientific and other corps, a barrister, a merchant, and a doctor. Upper and
  upper middle-class society is represented in all its grades, and by persons
  who, to judge by the position they hold and the callings they follow, ought
  to be possessed of intelligence and ability.</p>

  <p>Dr. Alfred Russel Wallace, the eminent naturalist, in the course of a
  letter to <i>The Times</i> (January 4, 1873), describing his visit to a
  public medium, said:</p>

  <p class="quote">I consider it no exaggeration to say that the main facts
are now as well
  established and as easily verifiable as any of the more exceptional phenomena
  of Nature which are not yet reduced to law. They have a most important
  bearing on the interpretation of history, which is full of narratives of
  similar facts, and on the nature of life and intellect, on which physical
  science throws a very feeble and uncertain light; and it is my firm and
  deliberate belief that every branch of philosophy must suffer till they are
  honestly and seriously investigated, and dealt with as constituting an
  essential portion of the phenomena of human nature.</p>

  <p>One becomes bemused by ectoplasm and laboratory experiments which lead the
  thoughts away from the essential. Wallace was one of the few whose great,
  sweeping, unprejudiced mind saw and accepted the truth in its wonderful
  completeness from the humble physical proofs of outside power to the highest
  mental teaching which that power could convey, teaching that far surpasses in
  beauty and in credibility any which the modern mind has known.</p>

  <p>The public acceptance and sustained support of this great scientific man,
  one of the first brains of his age, were the more important since he had the
  wit to understand the complete religious revolution which lay at the back of
  these phenomena. It has been a curious fact that with some exceptions in
  these days, as of old, the wisdom has been given to the humble and withheld
  from the learned. Heart and intuition have won to the goal where brain has
  missed it. One would think that the proposition was a simple one. It may be
  expressed in a series of questions after the Socratic form: "Have we
  established connexion with the intelligence of those who have died?" <i>The
  Spiritualist</i> says: "Yes." "Have they given us information of the new life
  in which they find themselves, and of how it has been affected by their earth
  life?" Again "Yes." "Have they found it correspond to the account given by
  any religion upon earth?" "No." Then if this be so, is it not clear that the
  new information is of vital religious import? The humble Spiritualist sees
  this and adapts his worship to the facts.</p>

  <p>Sir William (then Professor) Barrett brought the subject of Spiritualism
  before the British Association for the Advancement of Science in 1876. His
  paper was entitled "On Some Phenomena associated with Abnormal Conditions of
  Mind." He had difficulty in obtaining a hearing. The Biological Committee
  refused to accept the paper and passed it on to the Anthropological
  Sub-section, who only accepted it on the casting vote of the chairman, Dr.
  Alfred Russel Wallace. Colonel Lane Fox helped to overcome the opposition by
  asking why, as they had discussed ancient witchcraft the previous year, they
  should not examine modern witchcraft that year. The first part of Professor
  Barrett's paper dealt with mesmerism, but in the second part he related his
  experiences of Spiritualistic phenomena, and urged that further scientific
  examination should be given to the subject. He gave the convincing details of
  a remarkable experience he had had of raps occurring with a child.*</p>

  <p class="footnote">* <i>The Spiritualist</i>, Sept. 22, 1876, Vol. IX, pp.
  87-88.</p>

  <p>In the ensuing discussion Sir William Crookes spoke of the levitations he
  had witnessed with D.D. Home, and said of levitation: "The evidence in favour
  of it is stronger than the evidence in favour of almost any natural
  phenomenon the British Association could investigate." He also made the
  following remarks concerning his own method of psychic research:</p>

  <p class="quote">I was asked to investigate when Dr. Slade first came over,
and I mentioned
  my conditions. I have never investigated except under these conditions. It
  must be at my own house, and my own selection of friends and spectators,
  under my own conditions, and I may do whatever I like as regards apparatus. I
  have always tried, where it has been possible, to make the physical apparatus
  test the things themselves, and have not trusted more than is possible to my
  own senses. But when it is necessary to trust to my senses, I must entirely
  dissent from Mr. Barrett, when he says a trained physical inquirer is no
  match for a professional conjurer. I maintain a physical inquirer is more
  than a match.</p>

  <p>An important contribution to the discussion was made by Lord Rayleigh, the
  distinguished mathematician, who said:</p>

  <p class="quote">I think we are much indebted to Professor Barrett for his
courage, for it
  requires some courage to come forward in this matter, and to give us the
  benefit of his careful experiments. My own interest in the subject dates back
  two years. I was first attracted to it by reading Mr. Crookes's
  investigations. Although my opportunities have not been so good as those
  enjoyed by Professor Barrett, I have seen enough to convince me that those
  are wrong who wish to prevent investigation by casting ridicule on those who
  may feel inclined to engage in it.</p>

  <p>The next speaker, Mr. Groom Napier, was greeted with laughter when he
  described verified psychometric descriptions of people from their handwriting
  enclosed in sealed envelopes, and when he went on to describe spirit lights
  that he had seen, the uproar forced him to resume his seat. Professor
  Barrett, in replying to his critics, said:</p>

  <p class="quote">It certainly shows the immense advance that this subject
has made within
  the last few years, that a paper on the once laughed-at phenomena of
  so-called Spiritualism should have been admitted into the British
  Association, and should have been permitted to receive the full discussion it
  has had to-day.</p>

  <p>The London <i>Spectator</i>, in an article entitled "The British
  Association on Professor Barrett's Paper," opened with the following broad-
  minded view:</p>

  <p class="quote">Now that we have before us a full report of Professor
Barrett's paper, and
  of the discussion upon it, we may be permitted to express our hope that the
  British Association will really take some action on the subject of the paper,
  in spite of the protests of the party which we may call the party of
  superstitious incredulity. We say superstitious incredulity because it is
  really a pure superstition, and nothing else, to assume that we are so fully
  acquainted with the laws of Nature, that even carefully-examined facts,
  attested by an experienced observer, ought to be cast aside as utterly
  unworthy of credit, only because they do not at first sight seem to be in
  keeping with what is most clearly known already.</p>

  <p>Sir William Barrett's views steadily progressed until he accepted the
  Spiritualistic position in unequivocal terms before his lamented death in
  1925. He lived to see the whole world ameliorate its antagonism to such
  subjects, though little difference perhaps could be observed in the British
  Association which remained as obscurantist as ever. Such a tendency, however,
  may not have been an unmixed evil, for, as Sir Oliver Lodge has remarked, if
  the great pressing material problems had been complicated by psychic issues,
  it is possible that they would not have been solved. It may be worth
  remarking that Sir William Barrett in conversation with the author recalled
  that of the four men who supported him upon that historical and difficult
  occasion, every one lived to receive the Order of Merit&mdash;the greatest
  honour which their country could bestow. The four were Lord Rayleigh,
  Crookes, Wallace and Huggins.</p>

  <p>It was not to be expected that the rapid growth of Spiritualism would be
  without its less desirable features. These were of at least two kinds. First
  the cry of fraudulent mediumship was frequently heard. In the light of our
  later, fuller knowledge we know that much that bears the appearance of fraud
  is not necessarily fraud at all. At the same time, the unbounded credulity of
  a section of Spiritualists undoubtedly provided an easy field for charlatans.
  In the course of a paper read before the Cambridge University Society for
  Psychological Investigation in 1879, the President of the Society, Mr. J. A.
  Campbell, said*:</p>

  <p class="quote">Since the advent of Mr. Home, the number of media has
increased yearly,
  and so has the folly and the imposture. Every spook has become, in the eyes
  of fools, a divine angel; and not even every spook, but every rogue, dressed
  up in a sheet, who has chosen or shall choose to call himself a materialized
  "spirit." A so-called religion has been founded in which the honour of the
  most sacred names has been transferred to the ghosts of pickpockets. Of the
  characters of which divinities, and of the doctrines taught by them, I shall
  not insult you by speaking; so it ever is when folly and ignorance get into
  their hands the weapon of an eternal fact, abuse, distortion, crime itself;
  such were ever the results of children playing with edged tools, but who but
  an ignoramus would cry, naughty knife? Gradually the movement is clearing
  itself of such excretions, gradually is it becoming more sober and pure, and
  strong, and as sensible men and educated men study and pray and work,
  striving to make good use of their knowledge, will it become more so.</p>

  <p class="footnote">* <i>The Spiritualist</i>, April 11, 1879, p. 170.</p>

  <p>The second feature was the apparent increase of what may be termed
  anti-Christian, though not antireligious, Spiritualism. This led to William
  Howitt and other stalwart supporters ceasing their connexion with the
  movement. Powerful articles against this tendency were contributed to <i>The
  Spiritual Magazine</i> by Howitt and others.</p>

  <p>A suggestion of the need for caution and balance is afforded in the
  remarks of Mr. William Stainton Moses, who said in a paper read before the
  British National Association of Spiritualists on January 26, 1880*:</p>

  <p class="quote">We are emphatically in need of discipline and education. We
have hardly
  yet settled down after our rapid growth. The child, born just thirty years
  ago, has increased in stature (if not in wisdom) at a very rapid rate. It has
  grown so fast that its education has been a little neglected. In the
  expressive phraseology of its native country, it has been "dragged up" rather
  promiscuously; and its phenomenal growth has absorbed all other
  considerations. The time has now come when those who have regarded it as an
  ugly monster which was born by one of Nature's freaks only to die an early
  death, begin to recognize their mistake. The ugly brat means to live; and
  beneath its ugliness the least sympathetic gaze detects a coherent purpose in
  its existence. It is the presentation of a principle inherent in man's
  nature, a principle which his wisdom has improved away until it is wellnigh
  eliminated altogether, but which crops out again and again in spite of him
  &mdash;the principle of Spirit as opposed to Matter, of Soul acting and
  existing independently of the body which enshrines it. Long years of denial
  of aught but the properties of matter have landed the chief lights of modern
  science in pure Materialism. To them, therefore, this Spiritualism is a
  portent and a problem. It is a return to superstition; a survival of
  savagery; a blot on nineteenth century intelligence. Laughed at, it laughs
  back; scorned, it gives back scorn for scorn.</p>

  <p class="footnote">* <i>The Psychological Review</i>, Vol. II, p. 546.</p>

  <p>In 1881, <i>Light</i>, a high-class weekly Spiritualist newspaper, was
  begun, and 1882 saw the formation of the Society for Psychical Research.</p>

  <p>Speaking generally, it may be said that the attitude of organized science
  during these thirty years was as unreasonable and unscientific as that of
  Galileo's cardinals, and that if there had been a Scientific Inquisition, it
  would have brought its terrors to bear upon the new knowledge. No serious
  attempt of any sort, up to the formation of the S.P.R. was made to understand
  or explain a matter which was engaging the attention of millions of minds.
  Faraday in 1853 put forward the theory that table-moving was caused by
  muscular pressure, which may be true enough in some cases, but bears no
  relation to the levitation of tables, and in any case applies only to the one
  limited class of psychic phenomena. The usual "scientific" objection was that
  nothing occurred at all, which neglected the testimony of thousands of
  credible witnesses. Others argued that what did happen was capable of being
  exposed by a conjurer, and any clumsy imitation such as Maskelyne's parody of
  the Davenports was eagerly hailed as an exposure, with no reference to the
  fact that the whole mental side of the question with its overwhelming
  evidence was untouched thereby.</p>

  <p>The "religious" people, furious at being shaken out of their time-
  honoured ruts, were ready, like savages, to ascribe any new thing to the
  devil. Roman Catholics and the Evangelical sects, alike, found themselves for
  once united in their opposition. That low spirits may be reached, and low,
  lying messages received, is beyond all doubt, since every class of spirit
  exists around us, and like attracts like; but the lofty, sustaining and
  philosophic teaching which comes to every serious and humble-minded inquirer
  shows that it is Angelism and not Diabolism which is within our reach. Dr.
  Carpenter put forward some complex theory, but seems to have been in a
  minority of one in its acceptance or even in its comprehension. The doctors
  had an explanation founded upon the cracking of joints, which is ludicrous to
  anyone who has had personal experience of those percussive sounds which vary
  in range from the tick of a watch to the blow of a sledge-hammer.</p>

  <p>Further explanations, either then or later, included the Theosophic
  doctrine, which admitted the facts but depreciated the spirits, describing
  them as astral shells with a sort of dreamy half-consciousness, or possibly
  an attenuated conscience which made them sub-human in their intelligence or
  morality. Certainly the quality of spirit communion does vary greatly, but
  the highest is so high that we can hardly imagine that we are in touch with
  only a fraction of the speaker. As it is asserted, however, that even in this
  world our subliminal self is far superior to our normal workaday
  individuality, it would seem only fair that the spirit world should confront
  us with something less than its full powers.</p>

  <p>Another theory postulates the <i>Anima Mundi</i>, a huge reservoir or
  central bank of intelligence, with a clearing-house in which all inquiries
  are honoured. The sharp detail which we receive from the Other Side is
  incompatible with any vague grandiose idea of the sort. Finally, there is the
  one really formidable alternative, that man has an etheric body with many
  unknown gifts, among which a power of external manifestation in curious forms
  may be included. It is to this theory of Cryptesthesia that Richet and others
  have clung, and up to a point there is an argument in its favour. The author
  has satisfied himself that there is a preliminary and elementary stage in all
  psychic work which depends upon the innate and possibly unconscious power of
  the medium. The reading of concealed script, the production of raps upon
  demand, the description of scenes at a distance, the remarkable effects of
  psychometry, the first vibrations of the Direct Voice&mdash;each and all of
  these on different occasions have seemed to emanate from the medium's own
  power. Then in most cases there would appear an outside intelligence which
  was able to appropriate that force and use it for its own ends. An
  illustration might be given in the experiments of Bisson and Schrenck Notzing
  with Eva, where the ectoplasmic forms were at first undoubtedly reflections
  of newspaper illustrations, somewhat muddled by their passage through the
  medium's mind. Yet there came a later and deeper stage where an ectoplasmic
  form was evolved which was capable of movement and even of speech. Richet's
  great brain and close power of observation have been largely centred upon the
  physical phenomena, and he does not seem to have been brought much in contact
  with those personal mental and spiritual experiences which would probably
  have modified his views. It is fair to add, however, that those views have
  continually moved in the direction of the Spiritualistic explanation.</p>

  <p>There only remains the hypothesis of complex personality, which may well
  influence certain cases, though it seems to the author that such cases might
  be explained equally well by obsession. These instances, however, can only
  touch the fringe of the subject, and ignore the whole phenomenal aspect, so
  that the matter need not be taken very seriously. It cannot be too often
  repeated, however, that the inquirer should exhaust every possible normal
  explanation to his own complete satisfaction before he adopts the
  Spiritualistic view. If he has done this his platform is stable&mdash;if he
  has not done it he can never be conscious of its solidity. The author can say
  truly, that year after year he clung on to every line of defence until he was
  finally compelled, if he were to preserve any claim to mental honesty, to
  abandon the materialistic position.</p>

    <p class="caption">Daniel Dunglas Home.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p class="first">DANIEL DUNGLAS HOME was born in 1833 at Currie, a village
  near Edinburgh. There was a mystery about his parentage, and it has been both
  asserted and denied that he was related in some fashion to the family of the
  Earl of Home. Certainly he was a man who inherited elegance of figure,
  delicacy of feature, sensitiveness of disposition and luxury in taste, from
  whatever source he sprang. But for his psychic powers, and for the
  earnestness which they introduced into his complex character, he might have
  been taken as the very type of the aristocratic younger son who inherits the
  tendencies, but not the wealth, of his forbears.</p>

  <p>Home went from Scotland to New England, at the age of nine years, with his
  aunt who had adopted him, a mystery still surrounding his existence. When he
  was thirteen he began to show signs of the psychic faculties he had
  inherited, for his mother, who was descended from an old Highland family, had
  the characteristic second-sight of her race. His mystical trend had shown
  itself in a conversation with his boy friend, Edwin, about a short story
  where, as the result of a compact, a lover, after his death, manifested his
  presence to his lady-love. The two boys pledged themselves that whoever died
  first would come and show himself to the other. Home removed to another
  district some hundreds of miles distant, and about a month later, just after
  going to bed one night, he saw a vision of Edwin and announced to his aunt
  his death, news of which was received a day or two after. A second vision in
  1850 concerned the death of his mother, who with her husband had gone to live
  in America. The boy was ill in bed at the time, and his mother away on a
  visit to friends at a distance. One evening he called loudly for help, and
  when his aunt came she found him in great distress. He said that his mother
  had died that day at twelve o'clock; that she had appeared to him and told
  him so. The vision proved to be only too true. Soon loud raps began to
  disturb the quiet household, and furniture to be moved by invisible agency.
  His aunt, a woman of a narrow religious type, declared the boy had brought
  the Devil into her house, and turned him out of doors.</p>

  <p>He took refuge with friends, and in the next few years moved among them
  from town to town. His mediumship had become strongly developed, and at the
  houses where he stopped he gave frequent séances, sometimes as many as six or
  seven a day, for the limitations of power and the reactions between physical
  and psychic were little understood at that time. These proved a great drain
  on his strength, and he was frequently laid up with illness. People flocked
  from all directions to witness the marvels which occurred in Home's presence.
  Among those who investigated with him at this time was the American poet
  Bryant, who was accompanied by Professor Wells, of Harvard University. In New
  York he met many distinguished Americans, and three&mdash;Professor Hare,
  Professor Mapes, and Judge Edmonds, of the New York Supreme Court&mdash;had
  sittings with him. All three became, as already stated, convinced
  Spiritualists.</p>

  <p>In these early years the charm of Home's personality, and the deep
  impression created by his powers, led to his receiving many offers. Professor
  George Bush invited him to stay with him and study for the Swedenborgian
  ministry; and Mr. and Mrs. Elmer, a rich and childless couple, who had grown
  to cherish a great affection for him, offered to adopt him and make him their
  heir on condition of his changing his name to Elmer.</p>

  <p>His remarkable healing powers had excited wonder and, yielding to the
  persuasion of friends, he began to study for the medical profession. But his
  general delicate health, coupled with actual lung trouble, forced him to
  abandon this project and, acting under medical advice, he left New York for
  England.</p>

  <p>He arrived in Liverpool on April 9, 1855, and has been described as a
  tall, slim youth with a marked elegance of bearing and a fastidious neatness
  of dress, but with a worn, hectic look upon his very expressive face which
  told of the ravages of disease. He was blue-eyed and auburn-haired, of a type
  which is peculiarly liable to the attack of tubercle, and the extreme
  emaciation of his frame showed how little power remained with him by which he
  might resist it. An acute physician watching him closely would probably have
  gauged his life by months rather than years in our humid climate, and of all
  the marvels which Home wrought, the prolongation of his own life was perhaps
  not the least. His character had already taken on those emotional and
  religious traits which distinguished it, and he has recorded how, before
  landing, he rushed down to his cabin and fell upon his knees in prayer. When
  one considers the astonishing career which lay before him, and the large part
  which he played in establishing those physical foundations which
  differentiate this religious development from any other, it may well be
  claimed that this visitor was among the most notable missionaries who has
  ever visited our shores.</p>

  <p>His position at that moment was a very singular one. He had hardly a
  relation in the world. His left lung was partly gone. His income was modest,
  though sufficient. He had no trade or profession, his education having been
  interrupted by his illness. In character he was shy, gentle, sentimental,
  artistic, affectionate, and deeply religious. He had a strong tendency both
  to Art and the Drama, so that his powers of sculpture were considerable, and
  as a reciter he proved in later life that he had few living equals. But on
  the top of all this, and of an unflinching honesty which was so
  uncompromising that he often offended his own allies, there was one gift so
  remarkable that it threw everything else into insignificance. This lay in
  those powers, quite independent of his own volition, coming and going with
  disconcerting suddenness, but proving to all who would examine the proof,
  that there was something in this man's atmosphere which enabled forces
  outside himself and outside our ordinary apprehension to manifest themselves
  upon this plane of matter. In other words, he was a medium&mdash;the greatest
  in a physical sense that the modern world has ever seen.</p>

  <p>A lesser man might have used his extraordinary powers to found some
  special sect of which he would have been the undisputed high priest, or to
  surround himself with a glamour of power and mystery. Certainly most people
  in his position would have been tempted to use it for the making of money. As
  to this latter point, let it be said at once that never in the course of the
  thirty years of his strange ministry did he touch one shilling as payment for
  his gifts. It is on sure record that as much as two thousand pounds was
  offered to him by the Union Club in Paris in the year 1857 for a single
  séance, and that he, a poor man and an invalid, utterly refused it. "I have
  been sent on a mission," he said. "That mission is to demonstrate
  immortality. I have never taken money for it and I never will." There were
  certain presents from Royalty which cannot be refused without boorishness:
  rings, scarf-pins, and the like&mdash;tokens of friendship rather than
  recompense; for before his premature death there were few monarchs in Europe
  with whom this shy youth from the Liverpool landing-stage was not upon terms
  of affectionate intimacy. Napoleon the Third provided for his only sister.
  The Emperor of Russia sponsored his marriage. What novelist would dare to
  invent such a career?</p>

  <p>But there are more subtle temptations than those of wealth. Home's
  uncompromising honesty was the best safeguard against those. Never for a
  moment did he lose his humility and his sense of proportion. "I have these
  powers," he would say; "I shall be happy, up to the limit of my strength, to
  demonstrate them to you, if you approach me as one gentleman should approach
  another. I shall be glad if you can throw any further light upon them. I will
  lend myself to any reasonable experiment. I have no control over them. They
  use me, but I do not use them. They desert me for months and then come back
  in redoubled force. I am a passive instrument&mdash;no more." Such was his
  unvarying attitude. He was always the easy, amiable man of the world, with
  nothing either of the mantle of the prophet or of the skull-cap of the
  magician. Like most truly great men, there was no touch of pose in his
  nature. An index of his fine feeling is that when confirmation was needed for
  his results he would never quote any names unless he was perfectly certain
  that the owners would not suffer in any way through being associated with an
  unpopular cult. Sometimes even after they had freely given leave he still
  withheld the names, lest he should unwittingly injure a friend. When he
  published his first series of "Incidents in my Life," <i>The Saturday
  Review</i> waxed very sarcastic over the anonymous "evidence of Countess
  O&mdash;, Count B&mdash;, Count de K&mdash;, Princess de B&mdash; and Mrs.
  S&mdash;, who were quoted as having witnessed manifestations. In his second
  volume, Home, having assured himself of the concurrence of his friends,
  filled the blanks with the names of the Countess Orsini, Count de Beaumont,
  Count de Komar, Princess de Beauveau, and the well-known American hostess,
  Mrs. Henry Senior. His Royal friends he never quoted at all, and yet it is
  notorious that the Emperor Napoleon, the Empress Eugenie, the Tsar Alexander,
  the Emperor William the First of Germany, and the Kings of Bavaria and
  Wurtemberg were all equally convinced by his extraordinary powers. Never once
  was Home convicted of any deception, either in word or in deed.</p>

  <p>On first landing in England he took up his quarters at Cox's Hotel in
  Jermyn Street, and it is probable that he chose that hostelry because he had
  learned that through Mrs. Hayden's ministry the proprietor was already
  sympathetic to the cause. However that may be, Mr. Cox quickly discovered
  that his young guest was a most remarkable medium, and at his invitation some
  of the leading minds of the day were asked to consider those phenomena which
  Home could lay before them. Among others, Lord Brougham came to a séance and
  brought with him his scientific friend, Sir David Brewster. In full daylight
  they investigated the phenomena, and in his amazement at what happened
  Brewster is reported to have said: "This upsets the philosophy of fifty
  years." If he had said "fifteen hundred" he would have been within the mark.
  He described what took place in a letter written to his sister at the time,
  but published long after.* Those present were Lord Brougham, Sir David
  Brewster, Mr. Cox and the medium.</p>

  <p class="quote">"We four," said Brewster, "sat down at a moderately-sized
table, the
  structure of which we were invited to examine. In a short time the table
  struggled, and a tremulous motion ran up all our arms; at our bidding these
  motions ceased and returned. The most unaccountable rappings were produced in
  various parts of the table, and the table actually rose from the ground when
  no hand was upon it. A larger table was produced, and exhibited similar
  movements.</p>

  <p class="quote">"A small hand-bell was laid down with its mouth upon the
carpet, and after
  lying for some time, it actually rang when nothing could have touched it." He
  adds that the bell came over to him and placed itself in his hand, and it did
  the same to Lord Brougham; and concludes "These were the principal
  experiments. We could give no explanation of them, and could not conjecture
  how they could be produced by any kind of mechanism."</p>

  <p class="footnote">* <i>Home Life Of Sir David Brewster</i>, by Mrs. Gordon
  (his daughter), 1869.</p>

  <p>The Earl of Dunraven states that he was induced to investigate the
  phenomena by what Brewster had told him. He describes meeting the latter, who
  said that the manifestations were quite inexplicable by fraud, or by any
  physical laws with which we were acquainted. Home sent an account of this
  sitting in a letter to a friend in America, where it was published with
  comments. When these were reproduced in the English Press, Brewster became
  greatly alarmed. It was one thing to hold certain views privately, it was
  quite another to face the inevitable loss of prestige that would occur in the
  scientific circles in which he moved. Sir David was not the stuff of which
  martyrs or pioneers are made. He wrote to <i>The Morning Advertiser</i>,
  stating that though he had seen several mechanical effects which he could not
  explain, yet he was satisfied that they could all be produced by human hands
  and feet. At the time had, of course, never occurred to him that his letter
  to his sister, just quoted, would ever see the light.</p>

  <p>When the whole correspondence came to be published, <i>The Spectator</i>
  remarked of Sir David Brewster:</p>

  <p class="quote">It seems established by the clearest evidence that he felt
and expressed,
  at and immediately after his séances with Mr. Home, a wonder and almost awe,
  which he afterwards wished to explain away. The hero of science does not
  acquit himself as one could wish or expect.</p>

  <p>We have dwelt a little on this Brewster incident because it was typical of
  the scientific attitude of the day, and because its effect was to excite a
  wider public interest in Home and his phenomena, and to bring hundreds of
  fresh investigators. One may say that scientific men may be divided into
  three classes: those who have not examined the matter at all (which does not
  in the least prevent them from giving very violent opinions); those who know
  that it is true but are afraid to say so; and finally the gallant minority of
  the Lodges, the Crookes, the Barretts and the Lombrosos, who know it is true
  and who dare all in saying so.</p>

  <p>From Jermyn Street, Home went to stay with the Rymer family in Ealing,
  where many séances were held. Here he was visited by Lord Lytton, the famous
  novelist, who, although he received striking evidence, never publicly avowed
  his belief in the medium's powers, though his private letters, and indeed his
  published novels, are evidence of his true feeling. This was the case with
  scores of well-known men and women. Among his early sitters were Robert Owen
  the Socialist, T. A. Trollope the author, and Dr. J. Garth Wilkinson the
  alienist.</p>

  <p>In these days, when the facts of psychic phenomena are familiar to all
  save those who are wilfully ignorant, we can hardly realize the moral courage
  which was needed by Home in putting forward his powers and upholding them in
  public. To the average educated Briton in the material Victorian era a man
  who claimed to be able to produce results which upset Newton's law of
  gravity, and which showed invisible mind acting upon visible matter, was
  prima facie a scoundrel and an impostor. The view of Spiritualism pronounced
  by Vice-Chancellor Giffard at the conclusion of the Home-Lyon trial was that
  of the class to which he belonged. He knew nothing of the matter, but took it
  for granted that anything with such claims must be false. No doubt similar
  things were reported in far-off lands and ancient books, but that they could
  occur in prosaic, steady old England, the England of bank-rates and free
  imports, was too absurd for serious thought. It has been recorded that at
  this trial Lord Giffard turned to Home's counsel and said: "Do I understand
  you to state that your client claims that he has been levitated into the
  air?" Counsel assented, on which the judge turned to the jury and made such a
  movement as the high priest may have made in ancient days when he rent his
  garments as a protest against blasphemy. In 1868 there were few of the jury
  who were sufficiently educated to check the judge's remarks, and it is just
  in that particular that we have made some progress in the fifty years
  between. Slow work&mdash;but Christianity took more than three hundred years
  to come into its own.</p>

  <p>Take this question of levitation as a test of Home's powers. It is claimed
  that more than a hundred times in good light before reputable witnesses he
  floated in the air. Consider the evidence. In 1857, in a chateau near
  Bordeaux, he was lifted to the ceiling of a lofty room in the presence of
  Madame Ducos, widow of the Minister of Marine, and of the Count and Countess
  de Beaumont. In 1860 Robert Bell wrote an article, "Stranger than Fiction,"
  in <i>The Cornhill</i>. "He rose from his chair," says Bell, "four or five
  feet from the ground . We saw his figure pass from one side of the window to
  the other, feet foremost, lying horizontally in the air." Dr. Gully, of
  Malvern, a well-known medical man, and Robert Chambers, the author and
  publisher, were the other witnesses. Is it to be supposed that these men were
  lying confederates, or that they could not tell if a man were floating in the
  air or pretending to do so? In the same year Home was raised at Mrs. Milner
  Gibson's house in the presence of Lord and Lady Clarence Paget, the former
  passing his hands underneath him to assure himself of the fact. A few months
  later Mr. Wason, a Liverpool solicitor, with seven others, saw the same
  phenomenon. "Mr. Home," he says, "crossed the table over the heads of the
  persons sitting around it." He added: "I reached his hand seven feet from the
  floor, and moved along five or six paces as he floated above me in the air."
  In 1861 Mrs. Parkes, of Cornwall Terrace, Regent's Park, tells how she was
  present with Bulwer Lytton and Mr. Hall when Home in her own drawing-room was
  raised till his hand was on the top of the door, and then floated
  horizontally forward. In 1866 Mr. and Mrs. Hall, Lady Dunsany, and Mrs.
  Senior, in Mr. Hall's house saw Home, his face transfigured and shining,
  twice rise to the ceiling, leaving a cross marked in pencil upon the second
  occasion, so as to assure the witnesses that they were not the victims of
  imagination.</p>

  <p>In 1868 Lord Adare, Lord Lindsay, Captain Wynne, and Mr. Smith Barry saw
  Home levitate upon many occasions. A very minute account has been left by the
  first three witnesses of the occurrence of December 16* of this year, when at
  Ashley House Home, in a state of trance, floated out of the bedroom and into
  the sitting-room window, passing seventy feet above the street. After his
  arrival in the sitting-room he went back into the bedroom with Lord Adare,
  and upon the latter remarking that he could not understand how Home could
  have fitted through the window which was only partially raised, "he told me
  to stand a little distance off. He then went through the open space head
  first quite rapidly, his body being nearly horizontal and apparently rigid.
  He came in again feet foremost." Such was the account given by Lords Adare
  and Lindsay. Upon its publication Dr. Carpenter, who earned an unenviable
  reputation by a perverse opposition to every fact which bore upon this
  question, wrote exultantly to point out that there had been a third witness
  who had not been heard from, assuming without the least justification that
  Captain Wynne's evidence would be contradictory. He went the length of saying
  "a single honest sceptic declares that Mr. Home was sitting in his chair all
  the time "a statement which can only be described as false. Captain Wynne at
  once wrote corroborating the others and adding: "If you are not to believe
  the corroborative evidence of three unimpeached witnesses, there would be an
  end to all justice and courts of law."</p>

  <p class="footnote">* The almanac shows it to be Sunday the 13th.</p>

  <p>To show how hard put to it the critics have been to find some loophole of
  escape from the obvious, they have made much of the fact that Lord Lindsay,
  writing some time after the event, declared that it was seen by moonlight;
  whereas the calendar shows that the moon was not at that time visible. Mr.
  Andrew Lang remarks: "Even in a fog, however, people in a room can see a man
  coming in by the window, and go out again, head first, with body rigid." * It
  would seem to most of us that if we saw so marvellous a sight we would have
  little time to spare to determine whether we viewed it by the light of the
  moon or by that of the street lamps. It must be admitted, however, that Lord
  Lindsay's account is clumsily worded&mdash;so clumsily that there is some
  excuse for Mr. Joseph McCabe's reading of it that the spectators looked not
  at the object itself and its shadow on the window-sill, but that they stood
  with their backs to it and viewed the shadow on the wall. When one considers,
  however, the standing of the three eye-witnesses who have testified to this,
  one may well ask whether in ancient or modern times any preternatural event
  has been more clearly proved.</p>

  <p class="footnote">* <i>Historical Mysteries</i>, p. 236.</p>

  <p>So many are the other instances of Home's levitations that a long article
  might easily be written upon this single phase of his mediumship. Professor
  Crookes was again and again a witness to the phenomenon, and refers to fifty
  instances which had come within his knowledge. But is there any fair-minded
  person who has read the incident here recorded who will not say, with
  Professor Challis: "Either the facts must be admitted to be such as are
  reported, or the possibility of certifying facts by human testimony must be
  given up."</p>

  <p>"Are we, then, back in the age of miracles?" cries the reader. There is no
  miracle. Nothing on this plane is supernatural. What we see now, and what we
  have read of in ages past, is but the operation of law which has not yet been
  studied and defined. Already we realize something of its possibilities and of
  its limitations, which are as exact in their way as those of any purely
  physical power. We must hold the balance between those who would believe
  nothing and those who would believe too much. Gradually the mists will clear
  and we will chart the shadowy coast. When the needle first sprang up at the
  magnet it was not an infraction of the laws of gravity. It was that there had
  been the local intervention of another stronger force. Such is the case also
  when psychic powers act upon the plane of matter. Had Home's faith in this
  power faltered, or had his circle been unduly disturbed, he would have
  fallen. When Peter lost faith he sank into the waves. Across the centuries
  the same cause still produced the same effect. Spiritual power is ever with
  us if we do not avert our faces, and nothing has been vouchsafed to Judma
  which is withheld from England.</p>

  <p>It is in this respect, as a confirmation of the power of the unseen, and
  as a final answer to materialism as we now understand it, that Home's public
  career is of such supreme importance. He was an affirmative witness of the
  truth of those so-called "miracles" which have been the stumbling-block for
  so many earnest minds, and are now destined to be the strong solid proof of
  the accuracy of the original narrative. Millions of doubting souls in the
  agony of spiritual conflict had cried out for definite proof that all was not
  empty space around us, that there were powers beyond our grasp, that the ego
  was not a mere secretion of nervous tissue, and that the dead did really
  carry on their personal unbroken existence. All this was proved by this
  greatest of modern missionaries to anyone who could observe or reason. It is
  easy to poke superficial fun at rising tables and quivering walls, but they
  were the nearest and most natural objects which could record in material
  terms that power which was beyond our human ken. A mind which would be
  unmoved by an inspired sentence was struck into humility and into new paths
  of research in the presence of even the most homely of these inexplicable
  phenomena. It is easy to call them puerile, but they effected the purpose for
  which they were sent by shaking to its foundations the complaisance of those
  material men of science who were brought into actual contact with them. They
  are to be regarded not as ends in themselves, but as the elementary means by
  which the mind should be diverted into new channels of thought. And those
  channels of thought led straight to the recognition of the survival of the
  spirit. "You have conveyed incalculable joy and comfort to the hearts of many
  people," said Bishop Clark, of Rhode Island. "You have made dwelling-places
  light that were dark before." "Mademoiselle," said Home to the lady who was
  to be his wife, "I have a mission entrusted to me. It is a great and a holy
  one." The famous Dr. Elliotson, immortalized by Thackeray under the name of
  Dr. Goodenough, was one of the leaders of British materialism. He met Home,
  saw his powers, and was able soon to say that he had lived all his life in
  darkness and had thought there was nothing in existence but the material, but
  he now had a firm hope which he trusted he would hold while on earth.</p>

  <p>Innumerable instances could be quoted of the spiritual value of Home's
  work, but it has never been better summed up than in a paragraph from Mrs.
  Webster, of Florence, who saw much of his ministry. "He is the most
  marvellous missionary of modern times in the greatest of all causes, and the
  good that he has done cannot be reckoned. When Mr. Home passes he bestows
  around him the greatest of all blessings, the certainty of a future
  life."</p>

  <p>Now that the details of his career can be read, it is to the whole wide
  world that he brings this most vital of all messages. His attitude as to his
  own mission was expressed in a lecture given in London in Willis's Rooms on
  February 15, 1866. He said: "I believe in my heart that this power is being
  spread more and more every day to draw us nearer to God. You ask if it makes
  us purer? My only answer is that we are but mortals, and as such liable to
  err; but it does teach that the pure in heart shall see God. It teaches us
  that He is love, and that there is no death. To the aged it comes as a
  solace, when the storms of life are nearly over and rest cometh. To the young
  it speaks of the duty we owe to each other, and that as we sow so shall we
  reap. To all it teaches resignation. It comes to roll away the clouds of
  error, and bring the bright morning of a never-ending day."</p>

  <p>It is curious to see how his message affected those of his own generation.
  Reading the account of his life written by his widow&mdash;a most convincing
  document, since she of all living mortals must have known the real
  man&mdash;it would appear that his most utterly whole-hearted support and
  appreciation came from those aristocrats of France and Russia with whom he
  was brought into contact. The warm glow of personal admiration and even
  reverence in their letters is such as can hardly be matched in any biography.
  In England he had a close circle of ardent supporters, a few of the upper
  classes, with the Halls, the Howitts, Robert Chambers, Mrs. Milner Gibson,
  Professor Crookes, and others. But there was a sad lack of courage among
  those who admitted the facts in private and stood aloof in public. Lord
  Brougham and Bulwer Lytton were of the type of Nicodemus, the novelist being
  the worst offender. "Intelligentsia" on the whole came badly out of the
  matter, and many an Honoured name suffers in the story. Faraday and Tyndall
  were fantastically unscientific in their methods of prejudging a question
  first, and offering to examine it afterwards on the condition that their
  prejudgment was accepted. Sir David Brewster, as already shown, said some
  honest things, and then in a panic denied that he had said them, forgetting
  that the evidence was on actual record. Browning wrote a long poem&mdash;if
  such doggerel can be called poetry&mdash;to describe an exposure which had
  never taken place. Carpenter earned an unenviable notoriety as an
  unscrupulous opponent, while proclaiming some strange Spiritualistic thesis
  of his own. The secretaries of the Royal Society refused to take a cab-drive
  in order to see Crookes's demonstration of the physical phenomena, while they
  pronounced roundly against them.</p>

  <p>Lord Giffard inveighed from the Bench against a subject the first elements
  of which he did not understand.</p>

  <p>As to the clergy, such an order might not have existed during the thirty
  years that this, the most marvellous spiritual outpouring of many centuries,
  was before the public. One cannot recall the name of one British clergyman
  who showed any intelligent interest; and when in 1872 a full account of the
  St. Petersburg séances began to appear in <i>The Times</i>, it was cut short,
  according to Mr. H. T. Humphreys, "on account of strong remonstrances to Mr.
  Delane, the editor, by certain of the higher clergy of the Church of
  England." Such was the contribution of our official spiritual guides. Dr.
  Elliotson the Rationalist, was far more alive than they. The rather bitter
  comment of Mrs. Home is: "The verdict of his own generation was that of the
  blind and deaf upon the man who could hear and see."</p>

  <p>Home's charity was among his more beautiful characteristics. Like all true
  charity it was secret, and only comes out indirectly and by chance. One of
  his numerous traducers declared that he had allowed a bill for £5o to be sent
  in to his friend, Mr. Rymer. In self-defence it came out that it was not a
  bill but a cheque most generously sent by Home to help this friend in a
  crisis. Considering his constant poverty, fifty pounds probably represented a
  good part of his bank balance. His widow dwells with pardonable pride upon
  the many evidences found in his letters after his death. "Now it is an
  unknown artist for whose brush Home's generous efforts had found employment;
  now a distressed worker writes of his sick wife's life saved by comforts that
  Home provided; now a mother thanks him for a start in life for her son.</p>

  <p>How much time and thought he devoted to helping others when the
  circumstance of his own life would have led most men to think only of their
  own needs and cares."</p>

  <p>"Send me a word from the heart that has known so often how to cheer a
  friend!" cries one of his proteges.</p>

  <p>"Shall I ever prove worthy of all the good you have done me?" says another
  letter.</p>

  <p>We find him roaming the battlefields round Paris, often under fire, with
  his pockets full of cigars for the wounded. A German officer writes
  affectionately to remind him how he saved him from bleeding to death, and
  carried him on his own weak back out of the place of danger. Truly Mrs.
  Browning was a better judge of character than her spouse, and Sir Galahad a
  better name than Sludge.</p>

  <p>At the same time, it would be absurd to depict Home as a man of flawless
  character. He had the weakness of his temperament, and something feminine in
  his disposition which showed itself in many ways. The author, while in
  Australia, came across a correspondence dating from 1856 between Home and the
  elder son of the Rymer family. They had travelled together in Italy, and Home
  had deserted his friend under circumstances which showed inconstancy and
  ingratitude. It is only fair to add that his health was so broken at the time
  that he could hardly be called normal. "He had the defects of an emotional
  character," said Lord Dunraven, "with vanity highly developed, perhaps wisely
  to enable him to hold his own against the ridicule that was then poured out
  on Spiritualism and everything connected with it. He was liable to fits of
  great depression and to nervous crises difficult to understand, but he was
  withal of a simple, kindly, humorous, loving disposition that appealed to me
  . My friendship remained without change or diminution to the end."</p>

  <p>There are few of the varied gifts which we call "mediumistic" and St. Paul
  "of the spirit" which Home did not possess&mdash;indeed, the characteristic
  of his psychic power was its unusual versatility. We speak usually of a
  Direct Voice medium, of a trance speaker, of a clairvoyant or of a physical
  medium, but Home was all four. So far as can be traced, he had little
  experience of the powers of other mediums, and was not immune from that
  psychic jealousy which is a common trait of these sensitives. Mrs. Jencken,
  formerly Miss Kate Fox, was the only other medium with whom he was upon terms
  of friendship. He bitterly resented any form of deception, and carried this
  excellent trait rather too far by looking with eyes of suspicion upon all
  forms of manifestations which did not exactly correspond with his own. This
  opinion, expressed in an uncompromising manner in his last book, "Lights and
  Shadows of Spiritualism," gave natural offence to other mediums who claimed
  to be as honest as himself. A wider acquaintance with phenomena would have
  made him more charitable. Thus he protested strongly against any séance being
  held in the dark, but this is certainly a counsel of perfection, for
  experiments upon the ectoplasm which is the physical basis of all
  materializations show that it is usually affected by light unless the light
  is tinted red. Home had no large experience of complete materializations such
  as were obtained in those days by Miss Florence Cook, or Madame d'Esperance,
  or in our own time, by Madame Bisson's medium, and therefore he could
  dispense with complete darkness in his own ministry. Thus, his opinion was
  unjust to others. Again, Home declared roundly that matter could not pass
  through matter, because his own phenomena did not take that form; and yet the
  evidence that matter can in certain cases be passed through matter seems to
  be overwhelming. Even birds of rare varieties have been brought into séance
  rooms under circumstances which seem to preclude fraud, and the experiments
  of passing wood through wood, as shown before Zollner and the other Leipzig
  professors, were quite final as set forth in the famous physicist's account
  in "Transcendental Physics" of his experiences with Slade. Thus, it may count
  as a small flaw in Home's character that he decried and doubted the powers
  which he himself did not happen to possess.</p>

  <p>Some also might count it as a failing that he carried his message rather
  to the leaders of society and of life than to the vast toiling masses. It is
  probable that Home had, in fact, the weakness as well as the graces of the
  artistic nature and that he was most at ease and happiest in an atmosphere of
  elegance and refinement, with a personal repulsion from all that was sordid
  and ill-favoured. If there were no other reason the precarious state of his
  health unfitted him for any sterner mission, and he was driven by repeated
  hemorrhages to seek the pleasant and refined life of Italy, Switzerland and
  the Riviera. But for the prosecution of his mission, as apart from personal
  self-sacrifice, there can be no doubt that his message carried to the
  laboratory of a Crookes or to the Court of a Napoleon was more useful than if
  it were laid before the crowd. The assent of science and of character was
  needed before the public could gain assurance that such things were true. If
  it was not fully gained the fault lies assuredly with the hidebound men of
  science and thinkers of the day, and by no means with Home, who played his
  part of actual demonstration to perfection, leaving it to other and less
  gifted men to analyse and to make public that which he had shown them. He did
  not profess to be a man of science, but he was the raw material of science,
  willing and anxious that others should learn from him all that he could
  convey to the world, so that science should itself testify to religion while
  religion should be buttressed upon science. When Home's message has been
  fully learned an unbelieving man will not stand convicted of impiety, but of
  ignorance.</p>

  <p>There was something pathetic in Home's efforts to find some creed in which
  he could satisfy his own gregarious instinct&mdash;for he had no claims to be
  a strong-minded individualist&mdash;and at the same time find a niche into
  which he could fit his own precious packet of assured truth. His pilgrimage
  vindicates the assertion of some Spiritualists that a man may belong to any
  creed and carry with him the spiritual knowledge, but it also bears out those
  who reply that perfect harmony with that spiritual knowledge can only be
  found, as matters now stand, in a special Spiritualist community. Alas! that
  it should be so, for it is too big a thing to sink into a sect, however great
  that sect might become. Home began in his youth as a Wesleyan, but soon left
  them for the more liberal atmosphere of Congregationalism. In Italy the
  artistic atmosphere of the Roman Catholic Church, and possibly its record of
  so many phenomena akin to his own, caused him to become a convert with an
  intention of joining a monastic Order&mdash;an intention which his common
  sense caused him to abandon. The change of religion was at a period when his
  psychic powers had deserted him for a year, and his confessor assured him
  that as they were of evil origin they would certainly never be heard of again
  now that he was a son of the true Church. None the less, on the very day that
  the year expired they came back in renewed strength. From that time Home
  seems to have been only nominally a Catholic, if at all, and after his second
  marriage&mdash;both his marriages were to Russian ladies &mdash;he was
  strongly drawn towards the Greek Church, and it was under their ritual that
  he was at last laid to rest at St. Germain in 1886. "To another discerning of
  Spirits" (I Cor. xii. 10) is the short inscription upon that grave, of which
  the world has not yet heard the last.</p>

  <p>If proof were needed of the blamelessness of Home's life, it could not be
  better shown than by the fact that his numerous enemies, spying ever for some
  opening to attack, could get nothing in his whole career upon which to
  comment save the wholly innocent affair which is known as the Home-Lyon case.
  Any impartial judge reading the depositions in this case&mdash;they are to be
  found verbatim in the second series of "Incidents in My Life" &mdash; would
  agree that it is not blame but commiseration which was owing to Home. One
  could desire no higher proof of the nobility of his character than his
  dealings with this unpleasant freakish woman, who first insisted upon
  settling a large sum of money upon him, and then, her whim having changed and
  her expectations of an immediate introduction into high society being
  disappointed, stuck at nothing in order to get it back again. Had she merely
  asked for it back there is little doubt that Home's delicate feelings would
  have led him to return it, even though he had been put to much trouble and
  expense over the matter, which had entailed a change of his name to
  Home-Lyon, to meet the woman's desire that he should be her adopted son. Her
  request, however, was so framed that he could not honourably agree to it, as
  it would have implied an admission that he had done wrong in accepting the
  gift. If one consults the original letters&mdash;which few of those who
  comment upon the case seem to have done&mdash;one finds that Home, S. C. Hall
  as his representative and Mr. Wilkinson as his solicitor, implored the woman
  to moderate the unreasonable benevolence which was to change so rapidly into
  even more unreasonable malevolence. She was absolutely determined that Home
  should have the money and be her heir. A less mercenary man never lived, and
  he begged her again and again to think of her relatives, to which she
  answered that the money was her own to do what she pleased with, and that no
  relatives were dependent upon it. From the time that he accepted the new
  situation he acted and wrote as a dutiful son, and it is not uncharitable to
  suppose that this entirely filial attitude may not have been that which this
  elderly lady had planned out in her scheming brain. At any rate, she soon
  tired of her fad and reclaimed her money upon the excuse&mdash;a monstrous
  one to anyone who will read the letters and consider the dates&mdash;that
  spirit messages had caused her to take the action she had done.</p>

  <p>The case was tried in the Court of Chancery, and the judge alluded to Mrs.
  Lyon's "innumerable misstatements on many important particulars &mdash;
  misstatements upon oath so perversely untrue that they have embarrassed the
  Court to a great degree and quite discredited the plaintiff's testimony." In
  spite of this caustic comment, and in spite also of elementary justice, the
  verdict was against Home on the general ground that British law put the
  burden of disproof upon the defendant in such a case, and complete disproof
  is impossible when assertion is met by counter-assertion. Lord Giffard might,
  no doubt, have risen superior to the mere letter of the law had it not been
  that he was deeply prejudiced against all claims to psychic power, which were
  from his point of view manifestly absurd and yet were persisted in by the
  defendant under his nose in his own Court of Chancery. Even Home's worst
  enemies were forced to admit that the fact that he had retained the money in
  England and had not lodged it where it would have been beyond recovery proved
  his honest intentions in this the most unfortunate episode of his life. Of
  all the men of honour who called him friend, it is not recorded that he lost
  one through the successful machinations of Mrs. Lyon. Her own motives were
  perfectly obvious. As all the documents were in order, her only possible way
  of getting the money back was to charge Home with having extorted it from her
  by misrepresentation, and she was cunning enough to know what chance a medium
  &mdash;even an amateur unpaid medium&mdash;would have in the ignorant and
  material atmosphere of a mid-Victorian court of law. Alas! that we can omit
  the "mid-Victorian" and the statement still holds good.</p>

  <p>The powers of Home have been attested by so many famous observers, and
  were shown under such frank conditions, that no reasonable man can possibly
  doubt them. Crookes's evidence alone is conclusive.* There is also the
  remarkable book, reprinted at a recent date, in which Lord Dunraven gives the
  story of his youthful connexion with Home. But apart from these, among those
  in England who investigated in the first few years and whose public testimony
  or letters to Home show they were not only convinced of the genuineness of
  the phenomena, but also of their spiritual origin, may be mentioned the
  Duchess of Sutherland, Lady Shelley, Lady Gomm, Dr. Robert Chambers, Lady
  Otway, Miss Catherine Sinclair, Mrs. Milner Gibson, Mr. and Mrs. William
  Howitt, Mrs. De Burgh, Dr. Gully (of Malvern), Sir Charles Nicholson, Lady
  Dunsany, Sir Daniel Cooper, Mrs. Adelaide Senior, Mr. and Mrs. S. C. Hall,
  Mrs. Makdougall Gregory, Mr. Pickersgill, R.A., Mr. E. L. Blanchard, and Mr.
  Robert Bell.</p>

  <p class="footnote">* <i>Researches In The Phenomena Of Spiritualism</i>, and
  <i>S.P.R. Proceedings</i>, VI., p. 98.</p>

  <p>Others who went so far as to admit that the theory of imposture was
  insufficient to account for the phenomena were: Mr. Ruskin, Mr. Thackeray
  (then editor of <i>The Cornhill Magazine</i>), Mr. John Bright, Lord
  Dufferin, Sir Edwin Arnold, Mr. Heaphy, Mr. Durham (sculptor), Mr. Nassau
  Senior, Lord Lyndhurst, Mr. J. Hutchinson (ex-Chairman of the Stock
  Exchange), and Dr. Lockhart Robertson.</p>

  <p>Such were his witnesses and such his works. And yet, when his most useful
  and unselfish life had come to an end, it must be recorded to the eternal
  disgrace of our British Press that there was hardly a paper which did not
  allude to him as an impostor and a charlatan. The time is coming, however,
  when he will be recognized for what he was, one of the pioneers in the slow
  and arduous advance of Humanity into that jungle of ignorance which has
  encompassed it so long.</p>

    <p class="caption">The Davenport Brothers.</p>
  </div>

  <p class="first">IN order to present a consecutive story the career of D.D.
  Home has been traced in its entirety. It is necessary now to return to
  earlier days in America and consider the development of the two Davenports.
  Home and the Davenports both played an international part, and their history
  helps to cover the movement both in England and in the States. The Davenports
  worked upon a far lower level than Home, making a profession of their
  remarkable gifts, and yet by their crude methods they got their results
  across to the multitude in a way which a more refined mediumship could not
  have done. If one considers this whole train of events as having been
  engineered by a wise but by no means infallible or omnipotent force upon the
  Other Side, one observes how each occasion is met by the appropriate
  instrument, and how as one demonstration fails to impress some other one is
  substituted.</p>

  <p>The Davenports have been fortunate in their chroniclers. Two writers have
  published books* describing the events of their life, and the periodical
  literature of the time is full of their exploits.</p>

  <p>Ira Erastus Davenport and William Henry Davenport were born at Buffalo in
  the State of New York, the former on September 17, 1839, and the latter on
  February 1, 1841. Their father, who was descended from the early English
  settlers in America, occupied a position in the police department of Buffalo.
  Their mother was born in Kent, England, and went to America when a child.
  Some indications of psychic gifts were observed in the mother's life. In 1846
  the family were disturbed in the middle of the night by what they described
  as "raps, thumps, loud noises, snaps, crackling noises." This was two years
  before the outbreak in the Fox family. But it was the Fox manifestations
  which, in this case as in so many others, led them to investigate and
  discover their mediumistic powers.</p>

  <p class="footnote">* <i>A Biography Of The Brothers Davenport</i>, by T. L.
  Nichols, M.D., London, 1864. <i>Supramundane Facts In The Life Of Rev. J. B.
  Ferguson, LL.D.</i>, by T. L. Nichols, M.D., London, 1865. <i>Spiritual
  Experiences: Including Seven Months with the Brothers Davenport</i>, by
  Robert Cooper, London, 1867.</p>

  <p>The two Davenport boys and their sister Elizabeth, the youngest of the
  three, experimented by placing their hands on a table. Loud and violent
  noises were heard and messages were spelt out. The news leaked abroad, and as
  with the Fox girls, hundreds of curious and incredulous people flocked to the
  house. Ira developed automatic writing, and handed to those present messages
  written with extraordinary rapidity and containing information he could not
  have known. Levitation quickly followed, and the boy was floated in the air
  above the heads of those in the room at a distance of nine feet from the
  floor. Next, the brother and sister were influenced in the same way, and the
  three children floated high up in the room. Hundreds of respectable citizens
  of Buffalo are reported to have seen these occurrences. Once when the family
  was at breakfast the knives, forks, and dishes danced about and the table was
  raised in the air. At a sitting soon after this a lead pencil was seen to
  write in broad daylight, with no human contact. Seances were now held
  regularly, lights began to appear, and musical instruments floated and played
  above the heads of the company. The Direct Voice and other extraordinary
  manifestations too numerous to mention followed. Yielding to requests from
  the communicating intelligences, the brothers started journeying to various
  places and holding public séances. Among strangers, tests were insisted upon.
  At first the boys were held by persons selected from those present, but this
  being found unsatisfactory because it was thought that those holding them
  were confederates, the plan of tying them with ropes was adopted. To read the
  list of ingenious tests successively proposed, and put into operation without
  interfering with the manifestations, shows how almost impossible it is to
  convince resolute sceptics. As soon as one test succeeded another was
  proposed, and so on. The professors of Harvard University in 1857 conducted
  an examination of the boys and their phenomena. Their biographer writes*:</p>

  <p class="quote">The professors exercised their ingenuity in proposing
tests. Would they
  submit to be handcuffed? Yes. Would they allow men to hold them? Yes. A dozen
  propositions were made, accepted, and then rejected by those who made them.
  If any test was adopted by the brothers, that was reason enough for not
  trying it. They were supposed to be prepared for that, so some other must be
  found.</p>

  <p class="footnote">* <i>A Biography Of The Brothers Davenport</i>, by T. L.
  Nichols, M.D., pp. 87-8.</p>

  <p>Finally, the professors bought five hundred feet of new rope, bored with
  holes the cabinet set up in one of their rooms, and trussed the boys in what
  is described as a brutal manner. All the knots in the rope were tied with
  linen thread, and one of their number, Professor Pierce, took his place in
  the cabinet between the two brothers. At once a phantom hand was shown,
  instruments were rattled and were felt by the professor about his head and
  face. At every movement he felt for the boys with his hands, only to find
  them still securely bound. The unseen operators at last released the boys
  from their bindings, and when the cabinet was opened the ropes were found
  twisted round the neck of the professor! After all this, the Harvard
  professors made no report. It is instructive also to read the account of the
  really ingenious test-apparatus consisting of what may be described as wooden
  sleeves and trousers, securely fastened, devised by a man named Darling, in
  Bangor (U.S.A.). Like other tests, it proved incapable of preventing instant
  manifestations. It is to be remembered that many of these tests were applied
  at a time when the brothers were mere boys, too young to have learned any
  elaborate means of deception.</p>

  <p>It is not strange to read that the phenomena raised violent opposition
  almost everywhere, and the brothers were frequently denounced as jugglers and
  humbugs. It was after ten years of public work in the largest cities and
  towns in the United States that the Davenport Brothers came to England. They
  had submitted successfully to every test that human ingenuity could devise,
  and no one had been able to say how their results were obtained. They had won
  for themselves a great reputation. Now they had to begin all over again.</p>

  <p>The two brothers, Ira and William, at this time were aged twenty-five and
  twenty-three years respectively. <i>The New York World</i> thus describes
  them:</p>

  <p class="quote">They looked remarkably like each other in almost every
particular, both
  quite handsome with rather long, curly black hair, broad, but not high
  foreheads, dark keen eyes, heavy eyebrows, moustache and "goatee," firm-set
  lips, muscular though well-proportioned frame. They were dressed in black
  with dress-coats, one wearing a watch-chain.</p>

  <p>Dr. Nichols, their biographer, gives this first impression of them:</p>

  <p class="quote">The young men, with whom I have had but a brief personal
acquaintance, and
  whom I never saw until their arrival in London, appear to me to be in
  intellect and character above the average of their young countrymen, they are
  not remarkable for cleverness, though of fair abilities, and Ira has some
  artistic talent . The young men seem entirely honest, and singularly
  disinterested and unmercenary&mdash;far more anxious to have people satisfied
  of their integrity and the reality of their manifestations than to make
  money. They have an ambition, without doubt, which is gratified in their
  having been selected as the instruments of what they believe will be some
  great good to mankind.</p>

  <p>They were accompanied to England by the Rev. Dr. Ferguson, formerly pastor
  of a large church at Nashville, Tennessee, at which Abraham Lincoln attended,
  Mr. D. Palmer, a well-known operatic manager, who acted as secretary, and Mr.
  William M. Fay, who was also a medium.</p>

  <p>Mr. P. B. Randall, in his biography of the Davenports (Boston 1869,
  published anonymously), points out that their mission to England was "to meet
  on its own low ground and conquer, by appropriate means, the hard materialism
  and scepticism of England." The first step to knowledge, he says, is to be
  convinced of ignorance, and adds:</p>

  <p class="quote">If the manifestations given by the aid of the Brothers
Davenport can prove
  to the intellectual and scientific classes that there are forces&mdash;and
  intelligent forces, or powerful intelligences&mdash;beyond the range of their
  philosophies, and that what they consider physical impossibilities are
  readily accomplished by invisible, and to them unknown, intelligences, a new
  universe will be open to human thought and investigation.</p>

  <p>There is little doubt that the mediums had this effect on many minds.</p>

  <p>The manifestations of Mrs. Hayden's mediumship were quiet and unobtrusive,
  and while those of D.D. Home were more remarkable, they were confined
  entirely to exclusive sets of people to whom no fees were charged. Now these
  two brothers hired public halls and challenged the world at large to come and
  witness phenomena which passed the bounds of all ordinary belief. It needed
  no foresight to predict for them a strenuous time of opposition, and so it
  proved. But they attained the end which the unseen directors undoubtedly had
  in view. They roused public attention as it had never been roused before in
  England on this subject. No better testimony in proof of that could be had
  than that of their strongest opponent, Mr. J. N. Maskelyne, the celebrated
  conjurer.</p>

  <p>He writes*: "Certain it is, England was completely taken aback for a time
  by the wonders presented by these jugglers." He further adds:</p>

  <p class="quote">The Brothers did more than all other men to familiarize
England with the
  so-called Spiritualism, and before crowded audiences and under varied
  conditions, they produced really wonderful feats. The hole-and-corner séances
  of other media, where with darkness or semi-darkness, and a pliant, or
  frequently a devoted assembly, manifestations are occasionally said to occur,
  cannot be compared with the Davenport exhibitions in their effect upon the
  public mind.</p>

  <p class="footnote">* <i>Modern Spiritualism</i>, p. 65.</p>

  <p>Their first séance in London, a private one, was held on September 28,
  1864, at the residence in Regent Street of Mr. Dion Boucicault, the famous
  actor and author, in the presence of leading newspaper men and distinguished
  men of science. The Press reports of the séance were remarkably full and, for
  a wonder, fair.</p>

  <p>The account in the <i>Morning Post</i> the next day says that the guests
were
  invited to make the most critical examination and to take all needful
  precautions against fraud or deception, and continues:</p>

  <p class="quote">The party invited to witness the manifestations last night
consisted of
  some twelve or fourteen individuals, all of whom are admitted to be of
  considerable distinction in the various professions with which they are
  connected. The majority have never previously witnessed anything of the kind.
  All, however, were determined to detect and if possible expose any attempt at
  deception. The Brothers Davenport are slightly built, gentleman-like in
  appearance, and about the last persons in the world from whom any great
  muscular performances might be expected. Mr. Fay is apparently a few years
  older, and of more robust constitution.</p>

  <p>After describing what occurred, the writer goes on:</p>

  <p class="quote">All that can be asserted is, that the displays to which we
have referred
  took place on the present occasion under conditions and circumstances that
  preclude the presumption of fraud.</p>

  <p><i>The Times</i>, <i>The Daily Telegraph</i>, and other newspapers
  published long and honest reports. We omit quotations from them because the
  following important statement from Mr. Dion Boucicault, which appeared in
  <i>The Daily News</i> as well as in many other London journals, covers all
  the facts. It describes a later séance at Mr. Boucicault's house on October
  11, 1864, at which were present, among others Viscount Bury, M.P., Sir
  Charles Wyke, Sir Charles Nicholson, the Chancellor of the University of
  Sydney, Mr. Robert Chambers, Charles Reade, the novelist, and Captain
  Inglefield, the Arctic explorer.</p>

  <p class="quote">SIR,</p>

  <p class="quote">A séance by the Brothers Davenport and Mr. W. Fay took
place in my house
  yesterday in the presence of... (here he mentions twenty-four names including
  all those already quoted)...</p>

  <p class="quote">At three o'clock our party was fully assembled... We sent
to a neighbouring
  music-seller for six guitars and two tambourines, so that the implements to
  be used should not be those with which the operators were familiar.</p>

  <p class="quote">At half-past three the Davenport Brothers and Mr. Fay
arrived, and found
  that we had altered their arrangements by changing the room which they had
  previously selected for their manifestations.</p>

  <p class="quote">The séance then began by an examination of the dress and
persons of the
  Brothers Davenport, and it was certified that no apparatus or other
  contrivance was concealed on or about their persons. They entered the
  cabinet, and sat facing each other. Captain Inglefield then, with a new rope
  provided by ourselves, tied Mr. W. Davenport hand and foot, with his hands
  behind his back, and then bound him firmly to the seat where he sat. Lord
  Bury, in like manner, secured Mr. I. Davenport. The knots on these ligatures
  were then fastened with sealing-wax, and a seal was affixed. A guitar,
  violin, tambourine, two bells, and a brass trumpet were placed on the floor
  of the cabinet. The doors were then closed, and a sufficient light was
  permitted in the room to enable us to see what followed.</p>

  <p class="quote">I shall omit any detailed account of the babel of sounds
which arose in
  the cabinet, and the violence with which the doors were repeatedly burst open
  and the instruments expelled; the hands appearing, as usual, at a
  lozenge-shaped orifice in the centre door of the cabinet. The following
  incidents seem to us particularly worthy of note:</p>

  <p class="quote">While Lord Bury was stooping inside the cabinet, the door
being open and
  the two operators seen to be sealed and bound, a detached hand was clearly
  observed to descend upon him, and he started back, remarking that a hand had
  struck him. Again, in the full light of the gas chandelier and during an
  interval in the séance, the doors of the cabinet being open, and while the
  ligatures of the Brothers Davenport were being examined, a very white, thin,
  female hand and wrist quivered for several seconds in the air above. This
  appearance drew a general exclamation from all the party.</p>

  <p class="quote">Sir Charles Wyke now entered the cabinet and sat between
the two young men
  &mdash;his hands being right and left on each, and secured to them. The doors
  were then closed, and the babel of sounds recommenced. Several hands appeared
  at the orifice&mdash;among them the hand of a child. After a space, Sir
  Charles returned amongst us and stated that while he held the two brothers,
  several hands touched his face and pulled his hair; the instruments at his
  feet crept up, played round his body and over his head&mdash;one of them
  lodging eventually on his shoulders. During the foregoing incidents the hands
  which appeared were touched and grasped by Captain Inglefield, and he stated
  that to the touch they were apparently human hands, though they passed away
  from his grasp.</p>

  <p class="quote">I omit mentioning other phenomena, an account of which has
already been
  rendered elsewhere.</p>

  <p class="quote">The next part of the séance was performed in the dark. One
of the Messrs.
  Davenport and Mr. Fay seated themselves amongst us. Two ropes were thrown at
  their feet, and in two minutes and a half they were tied hand and foot, their
  hands behind their backs bound tightly to their chairs, and their chairs
  bound to an adjacent table. While this process was going on, the guitar rose
  from the table and swung or floated round the room and over the heads of the
  party, and slightly touching some. Now a phosphoric light shot from side to
  side over our heads; the laps and hands and shoulders of several were
  simultaneously touched, struck, or pawed by hands, the guitar meanwhile
  sailing round the room, now near the ceiling, and then scuffling on the head
  and shoulders of some luck less Wight. The bells whisked here and there, and
  a light thrumming was maintained on the violin. The two tambourines seemed to
  roll hither and thither on the floor, now shaking violently, and now visiting
  the knees and hands of our circle&mdash;all these foregoing actions, audible
  or tangible, being simultaneous. Mr. Rideout, holding a tambourine, requested
  it might be plucked from his hand; it was almost instantaneously taken from
  him. At the same time, Lord Bury made a similar request, and a forcible
  attempt to pluck a tambourine from his grasp was made which he resisted. Mr.
  Fay then asked that his coat should be removed. We heard instantly a violent
  twitch, and here occurred the most remarkable fact. A light was struck before
  the coat had quite, left Mr. Fay's person, and it was seen quitting him,
  plucked off him upwards. It flew up to the chandelier, where it hung for a
  moment and then fell to the ground. Mr. Fay was seen meanwhile bound hand and
  foot as before. One of our party now divested himself of his coat, and it was
  placed on the table. The light was extinguished and this coat was rushed on
  to Mr. Fay's back with equal rapidity. During the above occurrences in the
  dark, we placed a sheet of paper under the feet of these two operators, and
  drew with a pencil an outline around them, to the end that if they moved it
  might be detected. They of their own accord offered to have their hands
  filled with flour, or any other similar substance, to prove they made no use
  of them, but this precaution was deemed unnecessary; we required them,
  however, to count from one to twelve repeatedly, that their voices constantly
  heard might certify to us that they were in the places where they were tied.
  Each of our own party held his neighbour firmly, so that no one could move
  without two adjacent neighbours being aware of it.</p>

  <p class="quote">At the termination of this séance, a general conversation
took place on
  the subject of what we had heard and witnessed. Lord Bury suggested that the
  general opinion seemed to be that we should assure the Brothers Davenport and
  Mr. W. Fay that after a very stringent trial and strict scrutiny of their
  proceedings, the gentlemen present could arrive at no other conclusion than
  that there was no trace of trickery in any form, and certainly there were
  neither confederates nor machinery, and that all those who had witnessed the
  results would freely state in the society in which they moved that, so far as
  their investigations enabled them to form an opinion, the phenomena which had
  taken place in their presence were not the product of legerdemain. This
  suggestion was promptly acceded to by all present.</p>

  <p>There is a concluding paragraph in which Mr. Dion Boucicault states that
  he is not a Spiritualist, and at the close of the report his name and the
  date are affixed.</p>

  <p>This wonderfully full and lucid account is given without abbreviation
  because it supplies the answer to many objections, and because the character
  of the narrator and the witnesses cannot be questioned. It surely must be
  accepted as quite final so far as honesty is concerned. All subsequent
  objections are mere ignorance of the facts.</p>

  <p>In October, 1864, the Davenports began to give public séances at the
  Queen's Concert Rooms, Hanover Square. Committees were appointed from the
  audience, and every effort made to detect how it was all done, but without
  avail. These séances, interspersed with private ones, were continued almost
  nightly until the close of the year. The daily Press was full of accounts of
  them, and the brothers' names were on everyone's lips. Early in 1865 they
  toured the English provinces, and in Liverpool, Huddersfield, and Leeds they
  suffered violence at the hands of excited mobs. At Liverpool, in February,
  two members of the audience tied their hands so brutally that blood flowed,
  and Mr. Ferguson cut the rope and released them. The Davenports refused to
  continue, and the mob rushed the platform and smashed up the cabinet. The
  same tactics were resorted to at Huddersfield on February 21, and then at
  Leeds with increased violence, the result of organized opposition. These
  riots led to the Davenports cancelling any other engagements in England. They
  next went to Paris, where they received a summons to appear at the Palace of
  St. Cloud, where the Emperor and Empress and a party of about forty witnessed
  a séance. While in Paris, Hamilton, the successor of the celebrated
  conjurer., Robert Houdin, visited them, and in a letter to a Paris newspaper,
  he said: "The phenomena surpassed my expectations, and the experiments are
  full of interest for me. I consider it my duty to add they are inexplicable."
  After a return visit to London, Ireland was visited at the beginning of 1866.
  In Dublin they had many influential sitters, including the editor of the
  <i>Irish Times</i> and the Rev. Dr. Tisdal, who publicly proclaimed his
  belief in the manifestations.</p>

  </div><br>

  <p>In April of the same year the Davenports went to Hamburg and then to
  Berlin, but the expected war (which their guides told them would come about)
  made the trip unremunerative. Theatre managers offered them liberal terms for
  exhibitions, but, heeding the advice of their ever-present spirit monitor,
  who said that their manifestations, being supernatural, should be kept above
  the level of theatrical entertainments, they declined, though much against
  the wish of their business manager. During their month's stay in Berlin they
  were visited by members of the Royal family. After three weeks in Hamburg
  they proceeded to Belgium, where considerable success was attained in
  Brussels, and all the principal towns. They next went to Russia, arriving in
  St. Petersburg on December 27, 1866. On January 7, 1867, they gave their
  first public séance to an audience numbering one thousand. The next séance
  was at the residence of the French Ambassador to a gathering of about fifty
  people, including officers of the Imperial Court, and on January q they gave
  a séance in the Winter Palace to the Emperor and the Imperial family. They
  afterwards visited Poland and Sweden. On April 11, 1868, they reappeared in
  London at the Hanover Square Rooms, and received an enthusiastic welcome from
  a crowded audience. Mr. Benjamin Coleman, a prominent Spiritualist, who
  arranged their first public séances in London, writing at this time of their
  stay of close on four years in Europe, says*:</p>

  <p class="quote">I desire to convey to those of my friends in America who
introduced them
  to me, the assurance of my conviction that the Brothers' mission to Europe
  has been of great service to Spiritualism; that their public conduct as
  mediums&mdash;in which relation I alone know them&mdash;has been steady and
  unexceptionable.</p>

  <p class="footnote">* <i>Spiritual Magazine</i>, 1868, p. 321.</p>

  <p>He adds that he knows no form of mediumship better adapted for a large
  audience than theirs. After this visit to London the Davenports returned home
  to America. The brothers visited Australia in 1876, and on August 24 gave
  their first public séance in Melbourne. William died in Sydney in July,
  1877.</p>

  <p>Throughout their career the Davenport Brothers excited the deep envy and
  malice of the conjuring fraternity. Maskelyne, with amazing effrontery,
  pretended to have exposed them in England. His claims in this direction have
  been well answered by Dr. George Sexton, a former editor of <i>The Spiritual
  Magazine</i>, who described in public, in the presence of Mr. Maskelyne, how
  his tricks were done, and comparing them with the results achieved by the
  Davenports, said: "The two bear about as much resemblance to each other as
  the productions of the poet Close to the sublime and glorious dramas of the
  immortal bard of Avon."* Still the conjurers made more noise in public than
  the Spiritualists, and with the Press to support them they made the general
  public believe that the Davenport Brothers had been exposed.</p>

  <p class="footnote">* Address at Cavendish Rooms, London, June 15, 1873.</p>

  <p>In announcing the death in America of Ira Davenport in 1911, <i>Light</i>
  comments on the outpouring of journalistic ignorance for which it furnished
  the opportunity. The Daily News is quoted as saying of the brothers: "They
  made the mistake of appearing as sorcerers instead of as honest conjurers.
  If, like their conqueror, Maskelyne, they had thought of saying, 'It's so
  simple,' the brethren might have achieved not only fortune but
  respectability." In reply to this, <i>Light</i> asks why, if they were mere
  conjurers and not honest believers in their mediumship, did the Davenport
  Brothers endure hardships, insults, and injuries, and suffer the indignities
  that were put upon them, when by renouncing their claims to mediumship they
  might have been "respectable" and rich?</p>

  <p>An inevitable remark on the part of those who are not able to detect
  trickery is to ask what elevating purpose can be furthered by phenomena such
  as those observed with the Davenports. The well-known author and sturdy
  Spiritualist, William Howitt, has given a good answer:</p>

  <p class="quote">Are these who play tricks and fling about instruments
spirits from Heaven?
  Can God really send such? Yes, God sends them, to teach us this, if nothing
  more: that He has servants of all grades and tastes ready to do all kinds of
  work, and He has here sent what you call low and harlequin spirits to a low
  and very sensual age. Had He sent anything higher it would have gone right
  over the heads of their audiences. As it is, nine-tenths cannot take in what
  they see.</p>

  <p>It is a sad reflection that the Davenports&mdash;probably the greatest
  mediums of their kind that the world has ever seen&mdash;suffered throughout
  their lives from brutal opposition and even persecution. Many times they were
  in danger of their lives.</p>

  <p>One is forced to think that there could be no clearer evidence of the
  influence of the dark forces of evil than the prevailing hostility to all
  spiritual manifestations.</p>

  <p>Touching this aspect, Mr. Randall says*:</p>

  <p class="quote">There seems to be a sort of chronic dislike, almost hatred,
in the minds
  of some persons toward any and everything spiritual. It seems as if it were a
  vapour floating, in the air&mdash;a kind of mental spore flowing through the
  spaces, and breathed in by the great multitude of humankind, which kindles a
  rankly poisonous fire in their hearts against all those whose mission it is
  to bring peace on earth and good will to men. The future men and women of the
  world will marvel greatly at those now living, when they shall, as they will,
  read that the Davenports, and all other mediums, were forced to encounter the
  most inveterate hostility; that they, and the writer among them, were
  compelled to endure horrors baffling description, for no other offence than
  trying to convince the multitude that they were not beasts that perish and
  leave no sign, but immortal, deathless, grave-surviving souls.</p>

  <p class="quote">Mediums <i>alone</i> are capable of <i>demonstrating</i>
the fact of man's
  continued existence after death; and yet (strange inconsistency of human
  nature) the very people who persecute these, their truest and best friends,
  and fairly hound them to premature death or despair, are the very ones who
  freely lavish all that wealth can give upon those whose office it is merely
  to <i>guess</i> at human immortality.</p>

  <p class="footnote">* <i>Biography</i>, p. 82.</p>

  <p>In discussing the claims of various professional magicians to have exposed
  or imitated the Davenports, Sir Richard Burton said:</p>

  <p class="quote">I have spent a great part of my life in Oriental lands, and
have seen
  their many magicians. Lately I have been permitted to see and be present at
  the performances of Messrs. Anderson and Tolmaque. The latter showed, as they
  profess, clever conjuring, but they do not even attempt what the Messrs.
  Davenport and Fay succeed in doing: for instance, the beautiful management of
  the musical instruments. Finally, I have read and listened to every
  explanation of the Davenport "tricks" hitherto placed before the English
  public, and, believe me, if anything would make me take that tremendous jump
  "from matter to spirit," it is the utter and complete unreason of the reasons
  by which the "manifestations" are explained.</p>

  <p>It is to be remarked that the Davenports themselves, as contrasted with
  their friends and travelling companions, never claimed any preternatural
  origin for their results. The reason for this may have been that as an
  entertainment it was more piquant and less provocative when every member of
  the audience could form his own solution. Writing to the American conjurer
  Houdini, Ira Davenport said in his old age, "We never in public affirmed our
  belief in Spiritualism. That we regarded as no business of the public, nor
  did we offer our entertainment as the result of sleight-of-hand, or, on the
  other hand, as Spiritualism. We let our friends and foes settle that as best
  they could between themselves, but, unfortunately, we were often the victims
  of their disagreements."</p>

  <p>Houdini further claimed that Davenport admitted that his results were
  normally effected, but Houdini has himself stuffed so many errors of fact
  into his book, "A Magician Among the Spirits," and has shown such
  extraordinary bias on the whale question, that his statement carries no
  weight. The letter which he produces makes no such admission. A further
  statement quoted as being made by Ira Davenport is demonstrably false. It is
  that the instruments never left the cabinet. As a matter of fact, The Timer
  representative was severely struck in the face by a floating guitar, his brow
  being cut, and on several occasions when a light was struck instruments
  dropped all over the room. If Houdini has completely misunderstood this
  latter statement, it is not likely that he is very accurate upon the former
  (<i>Vide</i> Appendix).</p>

  <p>It may be urged, and has been urged, by Spiritualists as well as by
  sceptics that such mountebank psychic exhibitions are undignified and
  unworthy. There are many of us who think so, and yet there are many others
  who would echo these words of Mr. P. B. Randall:</p>

  <p class="quote">The fault lies not with the immortals, but in us; for, as
is the demand,
  so is the supply. If we cannot be reached in one way, we must be, and are,
  reached in another; and the wisdom of the eternal world gives the blind race
  just as much as it can bear and no more. If we are intellectual babes, we
  must put up with mental pap till our digestive capacities warrant and demand
  stronger food; and, if people can best be convinced of immortality by
  spiritual pranks and antics, the ends resorted to justify the means. The
  sight of a spectral arm in an audience of three thousand persons will appeal
  to more hearts, make a deeper impression, and convert more people to a belief
  in their hereafter, in ten minutes, than a whole regiment of preachers, no
  matter how eloquent, could in five years.</p>

    <p class="caption">Sir William Crookes.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p class="first">The research into the phenomena of Spiritualism by Sir
  William Crookes &mdash;or Professor Crookes, as he then was&mdash;during the
  years from 1870 to 1874 is one of the outstanding incidents in the history of
  the movement. It is notable on account of the high scientific standing of the
  inquirer, the stern and yet just spirit in which the inquiry was conducted,
  the extraordinary results, and the uncompromising declaration of faith which
  followed them. It has been a favourite device of the opponents of the
  movement to attribute some physical weakness or growing senility to each
  fresh witness to psychic truth, but none can deny that these researches were
  carried out by a man at the very zenith of his mental development, and that
  the famous career which followed was a sufficient proof of his intellectual
  stability. It is to be remarked that the result was to prove the integrity
  not only of the medium Florence Cook with whom the more sensational results
  were obtained, but also that of D.D. Home and of Miss Kate Fox, who were also
  severely tested.</p>

  <p>Sir William Crookes, who was born in 1832 and died in 1919, was pre-
  eminent in the world of science.</p>

  <p>Elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1863, he received from this body
  in 1875 a Royal Gold Medal for his various chemical and physical researches,
  the Davy Medal in 1888, and the Sir Joseph Copley Medal in 1904. He was
  knighted by Queen Victoria in 1897, and was awarded the Order of Merit in
  1910. He occupied the position of President at different tunes of the Royal
  Society, the Chemical Society, the Institution of Electrical Engineers, the
  British Association, and the Society for Psychical Research. His discovery of
  the new chemical element which he named "Thallium," his inventions of the
  radiometer, the spinthariscope, and the "Crookes' tube," only represent a
  slight part of his great research. He founded in 1859 <i>The Chemical
  News</i>, which he edited, and in 1864 he became editor of the <i>Quarterly
  Journal Of Science</i>. In 1880 the French Academy of Sciences awarded him a
  gold medal and a prize of 3,000 francs in recognition of his important
  work.</p>

  <p>Crookes confesses that he began his investigations into psychical
  phenomena believing that the whole matter might prove to be a trick. His
  scientific brethren held the same view, and were delighted at the course he
  had adopted. Profound satisfaction was expressed because the subject was to
  be investigated by a man so thoroughly qualified. They had little doubt that
  what were considered to be the sham pretensions of Spiritualism would now be
  exposed. One writer said, "If men like Mr. Crookes grapple with the subject
  we shall soon know how much to believe." Dr. (afterwards Professor) Balfour
  Stewart, in a communication to Nature, commended the boldness and honesty
  which had led Mr. Crookes to take this step. Crookes himself took the view
  that it was the duty of scientists to make such investigation. He writes: "It
  argues ill for the boasted freedom of opinion among scientific men that they
  have so long refused to institute a scientific investigation into the
  existence and nature of facts asserted by so many competent and credible
  witnesses, and which they are freely invited to examine when and where they
  please. For my own part, I too much value the pursuit of truth, and the
  discovery of any new fact in Nature, to avoid inquiry because it appears to
  clash with prevailing opinions." In this spirit he began his inquiry.</p>

  <p>It should be stated, however, that though Professor Crookes was sternly
  critical as to the physical phenomena, already he had had acquaintance with
  the mental phenomena, and would appear to have accepted them. Possibly this
  sympathetic spiritual attitude may have aided him in obtaining his remarkable
  results, for it cannot be too often repeated&mdash;because it is too often
  forgotten&mdash;that psychic research of the best sort is really "psychic,"
  and depends upon spiritual conditions. It is not the bumptious
  self-opinionated man, sitting with a ludicrous want of proportion as a judge
  upon spiritual matters, who attains results; but it is he who appreciates
  that the strict use of reason and observation is not incompatible with
  humility of mind, and that courteous gentleness of demeanour which makes for
  harmony and sympathy between the inquirer and his subject.</p>

  <p>Crookes's less material inquiries seem to have begun in the summer of
  1869. In July of that year he had sittings with the well-known medium, Mrs.
  Marshall, and in December with another famous medium, J. J. Morse. In July,
  1869, D.D. Home who had been giving séances in St. Petersburg, returned to
  London with a letter of introduction to Crookes from Professor Butlerof.</p>

  <p>An interesting fact emerges from a private diary kept by Crookes during
  his voyage to Spain in December, 1870, with the Eclipse Expedition. Under the
  date December 31, he writes:*</p>

  <p class="quote">I cannot help reverting in thought to this time last year.
Nelly (his
  wife) and I were then sitting together in communion with dear departed
  friends, and as twelve o'clock struck they wished us many happy New Years. I
  feel that they are looking on now, and as space is no obstacle to them, they
  are, I believe, looking over my dear Nelly at the same time. Over us both I
  know there is one whom we all&mdash;spirits as well as mortals&mdash;bow down
  to as Father and Master, and it is my humble prayer to Him&mdash;the Great
  Good as the mandarin calls Him&mdash;that He will continue His merciful
  protection to Nelly and me and our dear little family. May He also allow us
  to continue to receive spiritual communications from my brother who passed
  over the boundary when in a ship at sea more than three years ago.</p>

  <p class="footnote">* <i>Life Of Sir William Crookes</i>, by E. E. Fournier
  d'Albe, 1923.</p>

  <p>He further adds New Year loving greetings to his wife and children, and
  concludes:</p>

  <p class="quote">And when the earthly years have ended may we continue to
spend still
  happier ones in the spirit land, glimpses of which I am occasionally
  getting.</p>

  <p>Miss Florence Cook, with whom Crookes undertook his classical series of
  experiments, was a young girl of fifteen who was asserted to possess strong
  psychic powers, taking the rare shape of complete materialization. It would
  appear to have been a family characteristic, for her sister, Miss Kate Cook,
  was not less famous. There had been some squabble with an alleged exposure in
  which a Mr. Volckman had taken sides against Miss Cook, and in her desire for
  vindication she placed herself entirely under the protection of Mrs. Crookes,
  declaring that her husband might make any experiments upon her powers under
  his own conditions, and asking for no reward save that he should clear her
  character as a medium by giving his exact conclusions to the world.
  Fortunately, she was dealing with a man of unswerving intellectual honesty.
  We have had experience in these latter days of mediums giving themselves up
  in the same unreserved way to scientific investigation and being betrayed by
  the investigators, who had not the moral courage to admit those results which
  would have entailed their own public acceptance of the spiritual
  interpretation.</p>

  <p>Professor Crookes published a full account of his methods in <i>the
  Quarterly Journal Of Science</i>, of which he was then editor. In his house
  at Mornington Road a small study opened into the chemical laboratory, a door
  with a curtain separating the two rooms. Miss Cook lay entranced upon a couch
  in the inner room. In the outer in subdued light sat Crookes, with such other
  observers as he invited. At the end of a period which varied from twenty
  minutes to an hour the materialized figure was built up from the ectoplasm of
  the medium. The existence of this substance and its method of production were
  unknown at that date, but subsequent research has thrown much light upon it,
  an account of which has been embodied in the chapter on ectoplasm. The actual
  effect was that the curtain was opened, and there emerged into the laboratory
  a female who was usually as different from the medium as two people could be.
  This apparition, which could move, talk, and act in all ways as an
  independent entity, is known by the name which she herself claimed as her
  own, "Katie King."</p>

  <p>The natural explanation of the sceptic is that the two women were really
  the same woman, and that Katie was a clever impersonation of Florence. The
  objector could strengthen his case by the observation made not only by
  Crookes but by Miss Marryat and others, that there were times when Katie was
  very like Florence.</p>

  <p>Herein lies one of the mysteries of materialization which call for careful
  consideration rather than sneers. The author, sitting with Miss Besinnet, the
  famous American medium, has remarked the same thing, the psychic faces
  beginning when the power was weak by resembling those of the medium, and
  later becoming utterly unlike. Some speculators have imagined that the
  etheric form of the medium, her spiritual body, has been liberated by the
  trance, and is the basis upon which the other manifesting entities build up
  their own simulacra. However that may be, the fact has to be admitted; and it
  is paralleled by Direct Voice phenomena, where the voice often resembles that
  of the medium at first and then takes an entirely different tone, or divides
  into two voices speaking at the same time.</p>

  <p>However, the student has certainly the right to claim that Florence Cook
  and Katie King were the same individual until convincing evidence is laid
  before him that this is impossible. Such evidence Professor Crookes is very
  careful to give.</p>

  <p>The points of difference which he observed between Miss Cook and Katie are
  thus described:</p>

  <p class="quote">Katie's height varies; in my house I have seen her six
inches taller than
  Miss Cook. Last night, with bare feet and not tip-toeing, she was four and a
  half inches taller than Miss Cook. Katie's neck was bare last night; the skin
  was perfectly smooth both to touch and sight, whilst on Miss Cook's neck is a
  large blister, which under similar circumstances is distinctly visible and
  rough to the touch. Katie's ears are unpierced, whilst Miss Cook habitually
  wears ear-rings. Katie's complexion is very fair, while that of Miss Cook is
  very dark. Katie's fingers are much longer than Miss Cook's, and her face is
  also larger. In manners and ways of expression there are also many decided
  differences.</p>

  <p>In a later contribution, he adds:</p>

  <p class="quote">Having seen so much of Katie lately, when she has been
illuminated by the
  electric light, I am enabled to add to the points of difference between her
  and her medium which I mentioned in a former article. I have the most
  absolute certainty that Miss Cook and Katie are two separate individuals so
  far as their bodies are concerned. Several little marks on Miss Cook's face
  are absent on Katie's. Miss Cook's hair is so dark a brown as almost to
  appear black; a lock of Katie's, which is now before me, and which she
  allowed me to cut from her luxuriant tresses, having first traced it up to
  the scalp and satisfied myself that it actually grew there, is a rich golden
  auburn.</p>

  <p class="quote">On one evening I timed Katie's pulse. It beat steadily at
75, whilst Miss
  Cook's pulse a little time after was going at its usual rate of 90. On
  applying my ear to Katie's chest, I could hear a heart beating rhythmically
  inside, and pulsating even more steadily than did Miss Cook's heart when she
  allowed me to try a similar experiment after the séance. Tested in the same
  way, Katie's lungs were found to be sounder than her medium's, for at the
  time I tried my experiment Miss Cook was under medical treatment for a severe
  cough.</p>

  <p>Crookes took forty-four photographs of Katie King by the aid of electric
  light. Writing in <i>The Spiritualist</i> (1874, p. 270), he describes the
  methods he adopted:</p>

  <p class="quote">During the week before Katie took her departure, she gave
séances at my
  house almost nightly, to enable me to photograph her by artificial light.
  Five complete sets of photographic apparatus were accordingly fitted up for
  the purpose, consisting of five cameras, one of the whole-plate size, one
  half-plate, one quarter-plate, and two binocular stereoscopic cameras, which
  were all brought to bear upon Katie at the same time on each occasion on
  which she stood for her portrait. Five sensitizing and fixing baths were
  used, and plenty of plates were cleaned ready for use in advance, so that
  there might be no hitch or delay during the photographing operations, which
  were performed by myself, aided by one assistant.</p>

  <p class="quote">My library was used as a dark cabinet. It has folding doors
opening into
  the laboratory; one of these doors was taken off its hinges, and a curtain
  suspended in its place to enable Katie to pass in and out easily. Those of
  our friends who were present were seated in the laboratory facing the
  curtain, and the cameras were placed a little behind them, ready to
  photograph Katie when she came outside, and to photograph anything also
  inside the cabinet, whenever the curtain was withdrawn for the purpose. Each
  evening there were three or four exposures of plates in the five cameras,
  giving at least fifteen separate pictures at each séance; some of these were
  spoilt in the developing, and some in regulating the amount of light.
  Altogether I have forty-four negatives, some inferior, some indifferent, and
  some excellent.</p>

  <p>Some of these photographs are in the author's possession, and surely there
  is no more wonderful impression upon any plate than that which shows Crookes
  at the height of his manhood, with this angel&mdash;for such in truth she
  was&mdash;leaning upon his arm. The word "angel" may seem an exaggeration,
  but when an other-world spirit submits herself to the discomforts of
  temporary and artificial existence in order to convey the lesson of survival
  to a material and worldly generation, there is no more fitting term.</p>

  <p>Some controversy has arisen as to whether Crookes ever saw the medium and
  Katie at the same moment. Crookes says in the course of his report that he
  frequently followed Katie into the cabinet, "and have sometimes seen her and
  her medium together, but most generally I have found nobody but the entranced
  medium lying on the floor, Katie and her white robes having instantaneously
  disappeared."</p>

  <p>Much more direct testimony, however, is given by Crookes in a letter to
  the <i>Banner Of Light</i> (U.S.A.), which is reproduced in <i>The
  Spiritualist</i> (London) of July 17, 1874, p. 29. He writes:</p>

  <p class="quote">In reply to your request, I beg to state that I saw Miss
Cook and Katie
  together at the same moment, by the light of a phosphorus lamp, which was
  quite sufficient to enable me to see distinctly all I described. The human
  eye will naturally take in a wide angle, and thus the two figures were
  included in my field of vision at the same time, but the light being dim, and
  the two faces being several feet apart, I naturally turned the lamp and my
  eyes alternately from one to the other, when I desired to bring either Miss
  Cook's or Katie's face to that portion of my field of view where vision is
  most distinct. Since the occurrence here referred to took place, Katie and
  Miss Cook have been seen together by myself and eight other persons, in my
  own house, illuminated by the full blaze of the electric light. On this
  occasion Miss Cook's face was not visible, as her head had to be closely
  bound up in a thick shawl, but I specially satisfied myself that she was
  there. An attempt to throw the light direct on to her uncovered face, when
  entranced, was attended with serious consequences.</p>

  <p>The camera, too, emphasizes the points of difference between the medium
  and the form. He says:</p>

  <p class="quote">One of the most interesting of the pictures is one in which
I am standing
  by the side of Katie; she has her bare foot upon a particular part of the
  floor. Afterwards I dressed Miss Cook like Katie, placed her and myself in
  exactly the same position, and we were photographed by the same cameras,
  placed exactly as in the other experiment, and illuminated by the same light.
  When these two pictures are placed over each other, the two photographs of
  myself coincide exactly as regards stature, etc., but Katie is half a head
  taller than Miss Cook, and looks a big woman in comparison with her. In the
  breadth of her face, in many of the pictures, she differs essentially in size
  from her medium, and the photographs show several other points of
  difference.</p>

  <p>Crookes pays a high tribute to the medium, Florence Cook:</p>

  <p class="quote">The almost daily séances with which Miss Cook has lately
favoured me have
  proved a severe tax upon her strength, and I wish to make the most public
  acknowledgment of the obligations I am under to her for her readiness to
  assist me in my experiments. Every test that I have proposed she has at once
  agreed to submit to with the utmost willingness; she is open and
  straightforward in speech, and I have never seen anything approaching the
  slightest symptom of a wish to deceive. Indeed, I do not believe she could
  carry on a deception if she were to try, and if she did she would certainly
  be found out very quickly, for such a line of action is altogether foreign to
  her nature. And to imagine that an innocent schoolgirl of fifteen should be
  able to conceive and then successfully carry out for three years so gigantic
  an imposture as this, and in that time should submit to any test which might
  be imposed upon her, should bear the strictest scrutiny, should be willing to
  be searched at any time, either before or after a séance, and should meet
  with even better success in my own house than at that of her parents, knowing
  that she visited me with the express object of submitting to strict
  scientific tests&mdash;to imagine, I say, the Katie King of the last three
  years to be the result of imposture, does more violence to one's reason and
  common sense than to believe her to be what she herself affirms.*</p>

  </div><br>

  <p>Granting that a temporary form was built up from the ectoplasm of Florence
  Cook, and that this form was then occupied and used by an independent being
  who called herself "Katie King," we are still faced with the question, "Who
  was Katie King?" To this we can only give the answer which she gave herself,
  while admitting that we have no proof of it. She declared that she was the
  daughter of John King, who had long been known among Spiritualists as the
  presiding spirit at séances held for material phenomena. His personality is
  discussed later in the chapter upon the Eddy brothers and Mrs. Holmes, to
  which the reader is referred. Her earth name had been Morgan, and King was
  rather the general title of a certain class of spirits than an ordinary name.
  Her life had been spent two hundred years before, in the reign of Charles the
  Second, in the island of Jamaica. Whether this be true or not, she
  undoubtedly conformed to the part, and her general conversation was
  consistent with her account. One of the daughters of Professor Crookes wrote
  to the author and described her vivid recollection of tales of the Spanish
  Main told by this kindly spirit to the children of the family. She made
  herself beloved by all. Mrs. Crookes wrote:</p>

  <p class="quote">At a séance with Miss Cook in our own house when one of our
sons was an
  infant of three weeks old, Katie King, a materialized spirit, expressed the
  liveliest interest in him and asked to be allowed to see the baby. The infant
  was accordingly brought into the séance room and placed in the arms of Katie,
  who, after holding him in the most natural way for a short time, smilingly
  gave him back again.</p>

  <p>Professor Crookes has left it on record that her beauty and charm were
  unique in his experience.</p>

  <p>The reader may reasonably think that the subdued light which has been
  alluded to goes far to vitiate the results by preventing exact observation.
  Professor Crookes has assured us, however, that as the series of séances
  proceeded toleration was established, and the figure was able to bear a far
  greater degree of light. This toleration had its limits, however, which were
  never passed by Professor Crookes, but which were tested to the full in a
  daring experiment described by Miss Florence Marryat (Mrs. Ross-Church). It
  should be stated that Professor Crookes was not present at this experience,
  nor did Miss Marryat ever claim that he was. She mentions, however, the name
  of Mr. Carter Hall as being one of the company present. Katie had very
  good-humouredly consented to testing what the effect would be if a full light
  were turned upon her image:</p>

  <p class="quote">She took up her station against the drawing-room wall, with
her arms
  extended as if she were crucified. Then three gas-burners were turned on to
  their full extent in a room about sixteen feet square. The effect upon Katie
  King was marvellous. She looked like herself for the space of a second only,
  then she began gradually to melt away. I can compare the dematerialization of
  her form to nothing but a wax doll melting before a hot fire. First the
  features became blurred and indistinct; they seemed to run into each other.
  The eyes sunk in the sockets, the nose disappeared, the frontal bone fell in.
  Next the limbs appeared to give way under her, and she sank lower and lower
  on the carpet, like a crumbling edifice. At last there was nothing but her
  head left above the ground&mdash;then a heap of white drapery only, which
  disappeared with a whisk, as if a hand had pulled it after her&mdash;and we
  were left staring by the light of three gas-burners at the spot on which
  Katie King had stood.*</p>

  <p class="footnote">* <i>There Is No Death</i>, p. 143.</p>

  <p>Miss Marryat adds the interesting detail that at some of these séances
  Miss Cook's hair was nailed to the ground, which did not in the least
  interfere with the subsequent emergence of Katie from the cabinet.</p>

  <p>The results obtained in his own home were honestly and fearlessly reported
  by Professor Crookes in his Journal, and caused the greatest possible
  commotion in the scientific world. A few of the larger spirits, men like
  Russel Wallace, Lord Rayleigh, the young and rising physicist William
  Barrett, Cromwell Varley, and others, had their former views confirmed, or
  were encouraged to advance upon a new path of knowledge. There was a fiercely
  intolerant party, however, headed by Carpenter the physiologist, who derided
  the matter and were ready to impute anything from lunacy to fraud to their
  illustrious colleague. Organized science carne badly out of the matter. In
  his published account Crookes gave the letters in which he asked Stokes, the
  secretary of the Royal Society, to come down and see these things with his
  own eyes. By his refusal to do so, Stokes placed himself in exactly the same
  position as those cardinals who would not look at the moons of Jupiter
  through Galileo's telescope. Material science, when faced with a new problem,
  showed itself to be just as bigoted as mediaeval theology.</p>

  <p>Before quitting the subject of Katie King one should say a few words as to
  the future of the great medium from whom she had her physical being. Miss
  Cook became Mrs. Corner, but continued to exhibit her remarkable powers. The
  author is only aware of one occasion upon which the honesty of her mediumship
  was called in question, and that was when she was seized by Sir George
  Sitwell and accused of personating a spirit. The author is of opinion that a
  materializing medium should always be secured so that she cannot wander
  around&mdash;and this as a protection against herself. It is unlikely that
  she will move in deep trance, but in the half-trance condition there is
  nothing to prevent her unconsciously, or semi-consciously, or in obedience to
  suggestion from the expectations of the circle, wandering out of the cabinet
  into the room. It is a reflection of our own ignorance that a lifetime of
  proof should be clouded by a single episode of this nature. It is worthy of
  remark, however, that upon this occasion the observers agreed that the figure
  was white, whereas when Mrs. Corner was seized no white was to be seen. An
  experienced investigator would probably have concluded that this was not a
  materialization, but a transfiguration, which means that the ectoplasm, being
  insufficient to build up a complete figure, has been used to drape the medium
  so that she herself may carry the simulacrum. Commenting upon such cases, the
  great German investigator, Dr. Schrenck Notzing, says*:</p>

  <p class="footnote">* <i>Phenomena Of Materialization</i> (English
  Translation).</p>

  <p class="quote">This (a photograph) is interesting as throwing a light on
the genesis of
  the so-called transfiguration, I.E. the medium takes upon herself the part of
  the spirit, endeavouring to dramatize the character of the person in question
  by clothing herself in the materialized fabrics. This transition stage is
  found in nearly all materialization mediums. The literature of the subject
  records a large number of attempts at exposure of mediums thus impersonating
  "spirits," e.g. that of the medium Bastian by the Crown Prince Rudolph, that
  of Crookes's medium, Miss Cook, that of Madame d'Esperance, etc. In all these
  cases the medium was seized, but the fabrics used for masking immediately
  disappeared, and were not afterwards found.</p>

  <p>It would appear, then, that the true reproach in such cases lies with the
  negligent sitters rather than with the unconscious medium.</p>

  <p>The sensational nature of Professor Crookes's experiments with Miss Cook,
  and the fact, no doubt, that they seemed more vulnerable to attack, have
  tended to obscure his very positive results with Home and with Miss Fox,
  which have established the powers of those mediums upon a solid basis.
  Crookes soon found the usual difficulties which researchers encounter, but he
  had sense enough to realize that in an entirely new subject one has to adapt
  oneself to the conditions, and not abandon the study in disgust because the
  conditions refuse to adapt themselves to our own preconceived ideas. Thus, in
  speaking of Home, he says:</p>

  <p class="quote">The experiments I have tried have been very numerous, but
owing to our
  imperfect knowledge of the conditions which favour or oppose the
  manifestations of this force, to the apparently capricious manner in which it
  is exerted, and to the fact that Mr. Home himself is subject to unaccountable
  ebbs and flows of the force, it has but seldom happened that a result
  obtained on one occasion could be subsequently confirmed and tested with
  apparatus specially contrived for the purpose.*</p>

  <p class="footnote">* <i>Researches In The Phenomena Of Spiritualism</i>, p.
  10.</p>

  <p>The most marked of these results was the alteration in the weight of
  objects, which was afterwards so completely confirmed by Dr. Crawford working
  with the Goligher circle, and also in the course of the "Margery"
  investigation at Boston. Heavy objects could be made light, and light ones
  heavy, by the action of some unseen force which appeared to be under the
  influence of an independent intelligence. The checks by which all possible
  fraud was eliminated are very fully set out in the record of the experiments,
  and must convince any unprejudiced reader. Dr. Huggins, the well-known
  authority on the spectroscope, and Serjeant Cox, the eminent lawyer, together
  with several other spectators, witnessed the experiments. As already
  recorded, however, Crookes found it impossible to get some of the official
  heads of science to give the matter one hour of their attention.</p>

  <p>The playing upon musical instruments, especially an accordion, under
  circumstances when it was impossible to reach the notes, was another of the
  phenomena which was very thoroughly examined and then certified by Crookes
  and his distinguished assistants. Granting that the medium has himself the
  knowledge which would enable him to play the instrument, the author is not
  prepared to admit that such a phenomenon is an absolute proof of independent
  intelligence. When once the existence of an etheric body is granted, with
  limbs which correspond with our own, there is no obvious reason why a partial
  detachment should not take place, and why the etheric fingers should not be
  placed upon the keys while the material ones remain upon the medium's lap.
  The problem resolves itself, then, into the simpler proposition that the
  medium's brain can command his etheric fingers, and that those fingers can be
  supplied with sufficient force to press down the keys. Very many psychic
  phenomena, the reading with blindfolded eyes, the touching of distant
  objects, and so forth, may, in the opinion of the author, be referred to the
  etheric body and may be classed rather under a higher and subtler materialism
  than under Spiritualism. They are in a class quite distinct from those mental
  phenomena such as evidential messages from the dead, which form the true
  centre of the spiritual movement. In speaking of Miss Kate Fox, Professor
  Crookes says: "I have observed many circumstances which appear to show that
  the will and intelligence of the medium have much to do with the phenomena."
  He adds that this is not in any conscious or dishonest way, and continues, "I
  have observed some circumstances which seem conclusively to point to the
  agency of an outside intelligence not belonging to any human being in the
  room." * This is the point which the author has attempted to make as
  expressed by an authority far higher than his own.</p>

  <p class="footnote">* <i>Researches In The Phenomena Of Spiritualism</i>, p.
  95.</p>

  <p>The phenomena which were chiefly established in the investigation of Miss
  Kate Fox were the movement of objects at a distance, and the production of
  percussive sounds&mdash;or raps. The latter covered a great range of sound,
  "delicate ticks, sharp sounds as from an induction coil in full work,
  detonations in the air, sharp metallic taps, a crackling like that heard when
  a frictional machine is at work, sounds like scratching, the twittering as of
  a bird, etc." All of us who have had experience of these sounds have been
  compelled to ask ourselves how far they are under the control of the medium.
  The author has come to the conclusion, as already stated, that up to a point
  they are under the control of the medium, and that beyond that point they are
  not. He cannot easily forget the distress and embarrassment of a great
  North-country medium when in the author's presence loud raps, sounding like
  the snapping of fingers, broke out round his head in the coffee-room of a
  Doncaster hotel. If he had any doubts that raps were independent of the
  medium they were finally set at rest upon that occasion. As to the
  objectivity of these noises, Crookes says of Miss Kate Fox:</p>

  <p class="quote">It seems only necessary for her to place her hand on any
substance for
  loud thuds to be heard in it, like a triple pulsation, sometimes loud enough
  to be heard several rooms off. In this manner I have heard them in a living
  tree&mdash;on a sheet of glass&mdash;on a stretched iron wire&mdash;on a
  stretched membrane&mdash;a tambourine&mdash;on the roof of a cab &mdash;and
  on the floor of a theatre. Moreover, actual contact is not always necessary.
  I have had these sounds proceeding from the floor, walls, etc., when the
  medium's hands and feet were held&mdash;when she was standing on a
  chair&mdash;when she was suspended in a swing from the ceiling&mdash;when she
  was enclosed in a wire cage&mdash;and when she had fallen fainting on a sofa.
  I have heard them on a glass harmonicon&mdash;I have felt them on my own
  shoulder and under my own hands. I have heard them on a sheet of paper, held
  between the fingers by a piece of thread passed through one corner. With a
  full knowledge of the numerous theories which have been started, chiefly in
  America, to explain these sounds, I have tested them in every way that I
  could devise, until there has been no escape from the conviction that they
  were true objective occurrences not produced by trickery or mechanical
  means.</p>

  <p class="footnote">* <i>Researches In The Phenomena Of Spiritualism</i>, p.
  86.</p>

  <p>So finishes the legend of cracking toe joints, dropping apples, and all
  the other absurd explanations which have been put forward to explain away the
  facts. It is only fair to say, however, that the painful incidents connected
  with the latter days of the Fox sisters go some way to justify those who,
  without knowing the real evidence, have had their attention drawn to that
  single episode&mdash;which is treated elsewhere.</p>

  <p>It has sometimes been supposed that Crookes modified or withdrew his
  opinions upon psychic subjects as expressed in 1874. It may at least be said
  that the violence of the opposition, and the timidity of those who might have
  supported him, did alarm him and that he felt his scientific position to be
  in danger. Without going the length of subterfuge, he did unquestionably
  shirk the question. He refused to have his articles upon the subject
  republished, and he would not circulate the wonderful photographs in which
  the materialized Katie King stood arm-in-arm with himself. He was exceedingly
  cautious also in defining his position. In a letter quoted by Professor
  Angelo Brofferio, he says*:</p>

  <p class="quote">All that I am concerned in is that invisible and
intelligent beings exist
  who say that they are the spirits of dead persons. But proof that they really
  are the individuals they assume to be, which I require in order to believe
  it, I have never received, though I am disposed to admit that many of my
  friends assert that they have actually obtained the desired proofs, and I
  myself have already frequently been many times on the verge of this
  conviction.</p>

  <p class="footnote">* <i>Für den Spiritismus</i>, Leipzig, 1894, p. 319.</p>

  <p>As he grew older, however, this conviction hardened, or perhaps he became
  more conscious of the moral responsibilities which such exceptional
  experiences must entail.</p>

  <p>In his presidential address before the British Association at Bristol in
  1898, Sir William briefly referred to his earlier researches. He said:</p>

  <p class="quote">Upon one other interest I have not yet touched&mdash;to me
the weightiest
  and farthest&mdash;reaching of all. No incident in my scientific career is
  more widely known than the part I took many years ago in certain psychic
  researches. Thirty years have passed since I published an account of
  experiments tending to show that outside our scientific knowledge there
  exists a Force exercised by intelligence differing from the ordinary
  intelligence common to mortals . I have nothing to retract. I adhere to my
  already published statements. Indeed, I might add much thereto.</p>

  <p>Nearly twenty years later his belief was stronger than ever. In the course
  of an interview, he said*:</p>

  <p class="quote">I have never had any occasion to change my mind on the
subject. I am
  perfectly satisfied with what I have said in earlier days. It is quite true
  that a connexion has been set up between this world and the next.</p>

  <p class="footnote">* <i>The International Psychic Gazette</i>, December,
  1917, pp. 61-2.</p>

  <p>In reply to the question whether Spiritualism had not killed the old
  materialism of the scientists, he added:</p>

  <p class="quote">I think it has. It has at least convinced the great
majority of people,
  who know anything about the subject, of the existence of the next world.</p>

  <p>The author has had an opportunity lately, through the courtesy of Mr.
  Thomas Blyton, of seeing the letter of condolence written by Sir William
  Crookes on the occasion of the death of Mrs. Corner. It is dated April 24,
  1904, and in it he says: "Convey Lady Crookes's and my own sincerest sympathy
  to the family in their irreparable loss. We trust that the certain belief
  that our loved ones, when they have passed over, are still watching over us
  &mdash;a belief which owes so much of its certainty to the mediumship of Mrs.
  Corner (or Florence Cook, as she will always be in our memory &mdash; will
  strengthen and console those who are left behind." The daughter in announcing
  the death said, "She died in deep peace and happiness."</p>

  <h2><a name="chap12"
     id="chap12">XII. &mdash; THE EDDY BROTHERS AND THE HOLMESES</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IT is difficult within any reasonable compass to follow the
  rise of various mediums in the United States, and a study of one or two
  outstanding cases must typify the whole. The years 1874 and 1875 were years
  of great psychic activity, bringing conviction to some and scandal to others.
  On the whole the scandal seems to have predominated, but whether rightly or
  not is a question which may well be debated. The opponents of psychic truth
  having upon their side the clergy of the various churches, organized science,
  and the huge inert bulk of material mankind, had the lay Press at their
  command, with the result that everything that was in its favour was
  suppressed or contorted, and everything which could tell against it was given
  the widest publicity. Hence, a constant checking of past episodes and
  reassessment of old values are necessary. Even at the present day the air is
  charged with prejudice. If any man of standing at the present instant were to
  enter a London newspaper office and say that he had detected a medium in
  fraud, the matter would be seized upon eagerly and broadcast over the
  country; while if the same man proclaimed that he had beyond all question
  satisfied himself that the phenomena were true, it is doubtful if he would
  get a paragraph. The scale is always heavily weighted. In America, where
  there is practically no Libel Act, and where the Press is often violent and
  sensational, this state of things was&mdash;and possibly is&mdash;even more
  in evidence.</p>

  <p>The first outstanding incident was the mediumship of the Eddy brothers,
  which has probably never been excelled in the matter of materialization, or,
  as we may now call them, ectoplasmic forms. The difficulty at that date in
  accepting such phenomena lay in the fact that they seemed to be regulated by
  no known law, and to be isolated from all our experiences of Nature. The
  labours of Geley, Crawford, Madame Bisson, Schrenck Notzing and others have
  removed this, and have given us, what is at the lowest, a complete scientific
  hypothesis, sustained by prolonged and careful investigations, so that we can
  bring some order into the matter. This did not exist in 1874, and we can well
  sympathize with the doubt of even the most honest and candid minds, when they
  were asked to believe that two rude farmers, unmannered and uneducated, could
  produce results which were denied to the rest of the world and utterly
  inexplicable to science.</p>

  <p>The Eddy brothers, Horatio and William, were primitive folk farming a
  small holding at the hamlet of Chittenden, near Rutland, in the State of
  Vermont. An observer has described them as "sensitive, distant and curt with
  strangers, look more like hard-working rough farmers than prophets or priests
  of a new dispensation, have dark complexions, black hair and eyes, stiff
  joints, a clumsy carriage, shrink from advances, and make new-comers ill at
  ease and unwelcome. They are at feud with some of their neighbours and not
  liked . They are, in fact, under the ban of a public opinion that is not
  prepared or desirous to study the phenomena as either scientific marvels or
  revelations from another world."</p>

  <p>The rumours of the strange doings which occurred in the Eddy homestead had
  got abroad, and raised an excitement similar to that caused by the Koons's
  music-room in earlier days. Folk came from all parts to investigate. The
  Eddys seem to have had ample, if rude, accommodation for their guests, and to
  have boarded them in a great room with the plaster stripping off the walls
  and the food as simple as the surroundings. For this board, of course, they
  charged at a low rate, but they do not seem to have made any profit out of
  their psychic demonstrations.</p>

  <p>A good deal of curiosity had been aroused in Boston and New York by the
  reports of what was happening, and a New York paper, the Daily Graphic, sent
  up Colonel Olcott as investigator. Olcott was not at that time identified
  with any psychic movement&mdash;indeed, his mind was prejudiced against it,
  and he approached his task rather in the spirit of an "exposer." He was a man
  of clear brain and outstanding ability, with a high sense of honour. No one
  can read the very full and intimate details of his own life which are
  contained in his "Old Diary Leaves" without feeling a respect for the man
  &mdash;loyal to a fault, unselfish, and with that rare moral courage which
  will follow truth and accept results even when they oppose one's expectations
  and desires. He was no mystic dreamer but a very practical man of affairs,
  and some of his psychic research observations have met with far less
  attention than they deserve.</p>

  <p>Olcott remained for ten weeks in the Vermont atmosphere, which must in
  itself have been a feat of considerable endurance, with plain fare, hard
  living and uncongenial hosts. He came away with something very near to
  personal dislike for his morose entertainers, and at the same time with
  absolute confidence in their psychic powers. Like every wise investigator, he
  refuses to give blank certificates of character, and will not answer for
  occasions upon which he was not present, nor for the future conduct of those
  whom he is judging. He confines himself to his actual experience, and in
  fifteen remarkable articles which appeared in the <i>New York Daily
  Graphic</i> in October and November, 1874, he gave his full results and the
  steps which he had taken to check them. Reading these, it is difficult to
  suggest any precaution which he had omitted.</p>

  <p>His first care was to examine the Eddy history. It was a good but not a
  spotless record. It cannot be too often insisted upon that the medium is a
  mere instrument and that the gift has no relation to character. This applies
  to physical phenomena, but not to mental, for no high teaching could ever
  come through a low channel. There was nothing wrong in the record of the
  brothers, but they had once admittedly given a fake mediumistic show,
  announcing it as such and exposing tricks. This was probably done to raise
  the wind and also to conciliate their bigoted neighbours, who were incensed
  against the real phenomena. Whatever the cause or motive, it naturally led
  Olcott to be very circumspect in his dealings, since it showed an intimate
  knowledge of tricks.</p>

  <p>The ancestry was most interesting, for not only was there an unbroken
  record of psychic power extending over several generations, but their grand
  mother four times removed had been burned as a witch&mdash;or at least had
  been sentenced to that fate in the famous Salem trials of 1692. There are
  many living now who would be just as ready to take this short way with our
  mediums as ever Cotton Mather was, but police prosecutions are the modern
  equivalent. The father of the Eddys was unhappily one of those narrow
  persecuting fanatics. Olcott declares that the children were marked for life
  by the blows which he gave them in order to discourage what he chose to look
  upon as diabolical powers. The mother, who was herself strongly psychic, knew
  how unjustly this "religious" brute was acting, and the homestead must have
  become a hell upon earth. There was no refuge for the children outside, for
  the psychic phenomena used to follow them even into the schoolroom, and
  excite the revilings of the ignorant young barbarians around them. At home,
  when young Eddy fell into a trance, the father and a neighbour poured boiling
  water over him and placed a red&mdash;hot coal on his head, leaving an
  indelible scar. The lad fortunately slept on. Is it to be wondered at that
  after such a childhood the children should have grown into morose and
  secretive men?</p>

  <p>As they grew older the wretched father tried to make some money out of the
  powers which he had so brutally discouraged, and hired the children out as
  mediums. No one has ever yet adequately described the sufferings which public
  mediums used to undergo at the hands of idiotic investigators and cruel
  sceptics. Olcott testifies that the hands and arms of the sisters as well as
  the brothers were grooved with the marks of ligatures and scarred with
  burning sealing wax, while two of the girls had pieces of flesh pinched out
  by handcuffs. They were ridden on rails, beaten, fired at, stoned and chased
  while their cabinet was repeatedly broken to pieces. The blood oozed from
  their finger-nails from the compression of arteries. These were the early
  days in America, but Great Britain has little to boast of when one recalls
  the Davenport brothers and the ignorant violence of the Liverpool mob.</p>

  <p>The Eddys seem to have covered about the whole range of physical
  mediumship. Olcott gives the list thus&mdash;rappings, movement of objects,
  painting in oils and water-colours under influence, prophecy, speaking
  strange tongues, healing, discernment of spirits, levitation, writing of
  messages, psychometry, clairvoyance, and finally the production of
  materialized forms. Since St. Paul first enumerated the gifts of the spirit
  no more comprehensive list has ever been given.</p>

  <p>The method of the séances was that the medium should sit in a cabinet at
  one end of the room, and that his audience should occupy rows of benches in
  front of him. The inquirer will probably ask why there should be a cabinet at
  all, and extended experience has shown that it can, as a matter of fact, be
  dispensed with save in this particular crowning phenomenon of
  materialization. Home never used a cabinet, and it is seldom used by our
  chief British mediums of to-day. There is, however, a very definite reason
  for its presence. Without being too didactic upon a subject which is still
  under examination, it may at least be stated, as a working hypothesis with a
  great deal to recommend it, that the ectoplasmic vapour which solidifies into
  the plasmic substance from which the forms are constructed can be more easily
  condensed in a limited space. It has been found, however, that the presence
  of the medium within that space is not needful. At the greatest
  materialization séance which the author has ever attended, where some twenty
  forms of various ages and sizes appeared in one evening, the medium sat
  outside the door of the cabinet from which the shapes emerged. Presumably,
  according to the hypothesis, his ectoplasmic vapour was conducted into the
  confined space, irrespective of the position of his physical body. This had
  not been recognized at the date of this investigation, so the cabinet was
  employed.</p>

  <p>It is obvious, however, that the cabinet offered a means for fraud and
  impersonation, so it had to be carefully examined. It was on the second
  floor, with one small window. Olcott had the window netted with a mosquito
  curtain fastened on the outside. The rest of the cabinet was solid wood and
  unapproachable save by the room in which the spectators were sitting. There
  seems to have been no possible opening for fraud. Olcott had it examined by
  an expert, whose certificate is given in the book.</p>

  <p>Under these circumstances Olcott related in his newspaper articles, and
  afterwards in his remarkable book, "People from the Other World," that he saw
  in the course of ten weeks no fewer than four hundred apparitions appear out
  of this cabinet, of all sorts, sizes, sexes and races, clad in the most
  marvellous garments, babies in arms, Indian warriors, gentlemen in evening
  dress, a Kurd with a nine-foot lance, squaws who smoked tobacco, ladies in
  fine costumes. Such was Olcott's evidence, and there was not a statement he
  made for which he was not prepared to produce the evidence of a roomful of
  people. His story was received with incredulity then, and will excite little
  less incredulity now. Olcott, full of his subject and knowing his own
  precautions, chafed, as all of us chafe, at the criticism of those who had
  not been present, and who chose to assume that those who were present were
  dupes and simpletons. He says: "If one tells them of babies being carried in
  from the cabinet by women, of young girls with lithe forms, yellow hair and
  short stature, of old women and men standing in full sight and speaking to
  us, of half-grown children seen, two at a time, simultaneously with another
  form, of costumes of different makes, of bald heads, grey hair, black shocky
  heads of hair, curly hair, of ghosts instantly recognized by friends, and
  ghosts speaking audibly in a foreign language of which the medium is ignorant
  &mdash;their equanimity is not disturbed... The credulity of some scientific
  men, too, is boundless&mdash;they would rather believe that a baby could lift
  a mountain without levers, than that a spirit could lift an ounce."</p>

  <p>But apart from the extreme sceptic, whom nothing will convince and who
  would label the Angel Gabriel at the last day as an optical delusion, there
  are some very natural objections which an honest novice is bound to make, and
  an honest believer to answer. What about these costumes? Whence come they?
  Can we accept a nine-foot lance as being a spiritual object? The answer lies,
  so far as we understand it, in the amazing properties of ectoplasm. It is the
  most protean substance, capable of being moulded instantly into any shape,
  and the moulding power is spirit will, either in or out of the body. Anything
  may in an instant be fashioned from it if the predominating intelligence so
  decides. At all such séances there appears to be present one controlling
  spiritual being who marshals the figures and arranges the whole programme.
  Sometimes he speaks and openly directs. Sometimes he is silent and manifests
  only by his actions. As already stated, such controls are very often Red
  Indians who appear in their spiritual life to have some special affinity with
  physical phenomena.</p>

  <p>William Eddy, the chief medium for these phenomena, does not appear to
  have suffered in health or strength from that which is usually a most
  exhausting process. Crookes has testified how Home would "lie in an almost
  fainting condition on the floor, pale and speechless." Home, however, was not
  a rude open air farmer, but a sensitive artistic invalid. Eddy seems to have
  eaten little, but smoked incessantly. Music and singing were employed at the
  séances, for it has long been observed that there is a close connexion
  between musical vibrations and psychic results. White light also has been
  found to prohibit results, and this is now explained from the devastating
  effects which light has been shown to exert upon ectoplasm. Many colours have
  been tried in order to prevent total darkness, but if you can trust your
  medium the latter is the most conducive to results, especially to those
  results of phosphorescent and flashing lights which are among the most
  beautiful of the phenomena. If a light is used, red is the colour which is
  best tolerated. In the Eddy séances there was a subdued illumination from a
  shaded lamp.</p>

  <p>It would be wearisome to the reader to enter into details as to the
  various types which appeared in these remarkable gatherings. Madame
  Blavatsky, who was then an unknown woman in New York, had come up to see the
  sights. At that time she had not yet developed the theosophical line of
  thought, and was an ardent Spiritualist. Colonel Olcott and she met for the
  first time in the Vermont farm-house, and there began a friendship which was
  destined in the future to lead to strange developments. In her honour
  apparently a whole train of Russian images appeared, who carried on
  conversations in that language with the lady. The chief apparitions, however,
  were a giant Indian named Santum and an Indian squaw named Honto, who
  materialized so completely and so often that the audience may well have been
  excused if they forgot sometimes that they were dealing with spirits at all.
  So close was the contact that Olcott measured Honto on a painted scale beside
  the cabinet door. She was five feet three. On one occasion she exposed her
  woman's breast and asked a lady present to feel the beating of her heart.
  Honto was a light-hearted person, fond of dancing, of singing, of smoking,
  and of exhibiting her wealth of dark hair to the audience. Santum, on the
  other hand, was a taciturn warrior, six feet three in height. The height of
  the medium was five feet nine.</p>

  <p>It is worth noting that the Indian always wore a powder-horn, which had
  been actually given him by a visitor to the circle. This was hung up in the
  cabinet and was donned by him when he materialized. Some of the Eddy spirits
  could speak and others could not, while the amount of fluency varied greatly.
  This was in accordance with the author's experience at similar séances. It
  seems that the returning soul has much to learn when it handles this
  simulacrum of itself, and that here, as elsewhere, practice goes for much. In
  speaking, these figures move their lips exactly as human beings would do. It
  has been shown also that their breath in lime water produces the
  characteristic reaction of carbon dioxide. Olcott says: "The spirits
  themselves say that they have to learn the art of self-materialization, as
  one would any other art." At first they could only make tangible hands as in
  the cases of the Davenports, the Foxes, and others. Many mediums never get
  beyond this stage.</p>

  <p>Among the numerous visitors to the Vermont homestead there were naturally
  some who took up a hostile attitude. None of these, however, seems to have
  gone into the matter with any thoroughness. The one who attracted most
  attention was a Dr. Beard, of New York, a medical man, who on the strength of
  a single sitting contended that the figures were all impersonations by
  William Eddy himself. No evidence, and only his own individual impression is
  put forward to sustain this view, and he declared that he could produce all
  the effects with "three dollars' worth of theatrical properties." Such an
  opinion might well be honestly formed upon a single performance, especially
  if it should have been a more or less unsuccessful one. But it becomes
  perfectly untenable when it is compared with the experiences of those who
  attended a number of sittings. Thus, Dr. Hodgson, of Stoneham, Mass.,
  together with four other witnesses, signed a document: "We certify that
  Santum was out on the platform when another Indian of almost as great a
  stature came out, and the two passed and re-passed each other as they walked
  up and down. At the same time a conversation was being carried on between
  George Dix, Mayflower, old Mr. Morse, and Mrs. Eaton inside the cabinet. We
  recognized the familiar voice of each." There are many such testimonies,
  apart from Olcott, and they put the theory of impersonation quite out of
  court. It should be added that many of the forms were little children and
  babies in arms. Olcott measured one child two feet four in height. It should,
  in fairness, be added that the one thing which clouds the reader occasionally
  is Olcott's own hesitation and reservations. He was new to the subject, and
  every now and then a wave of fear and doubt would pass over his mind, and he
  would feel that he had committed himself too far and that he must hedge in
  case, in some inexplicable way, he should be shown to be in the wrong. Thus,
  he says: "The forms I saw at Chittenden, while apparently defying any other
  explanation than that they are of super-sensual origin, are still as a
  scientific fact to be regarded as `not proven.'" Elsewhere he talks about not
  having "test conditions."</p>

  <p>This expression "test conditions" has become a sort of shibboleth which
  loses all meaning. Thus, when you say that you have beyond all question or
  doubt seen your own dead mother's face before you, the objector replies: "Ah,
  but was it under test conditions?" The test lies in the phenomenon itself.
  When one considers that Olcott was permitted for ten weeks to examine the
  little wooden enclosure which served as cabinet, to occlude the window, to
  search the medium, to measure and to weigh the ectoplasmic forms, one wonders
  what else he would demand in order to make assurance complete. The fact is,
  that while Olcott was writing his account there came the alleged exposure of
  Mrs. Holmes, and the partial recantation of Mr. Dale Owen, and that this
  caused him to take these precautions.</p>

  <p>It was William Eddy whose mediumship took the form of materializations.
  Horatio Eddy gave séances of quite a different character. In his case a sort
  of cloth screen was fixed up, in front of which he used to sit in good light
  with one of his audience beside him holding his hand. Behind the screen was
  placed a guitar and other instruments, which presently began to play,
  apparently of their own accord, while materialized hands showed themselves
  over the edge of the screen. The general effect of the performance was much
  the same as that of the Davenport brothers, but it was more impressive,
  inasmuch as the medium was in full view, and was under control by a
  spectator. The hypothesis of modern psychic science, founded upon many
  experiments, especially those of Dr. Crawford, of Belfast, is that invisible
  bands of ectoplasm, which are rather conductors of force than forcible in
  themselves, are evolved from the body of the medium and connect up with the
  object to be manipulated, where they are used to raise it, or to play it, as
  the unseen power may desire&mdash;that unseen power being, according to the
  present views of Professor Charles Richet, some extension of the personality
  of the medium, and according to the more advanced school some independent
  entity. Of this nothing was known at the time of the Eddys, and the phenomena
  presented the questionable appearance of a whole series of effects without
  any cause. As to the reality of the fact, it is impossible to read Olcott's
  very detailed description without being convinced that there could be no
  error in that. This movement of objects at a distance from the medium, or
  <i>telekinesis</i>, to use the modern phrase, is now a rare phenomenon in
  light, but on one occasion at an amateur circle of experienced Spiritualists
  the author has seen a large platter-shaped circle of wood in the full light
  of a candle, rising up on edge and flapping code answers to questions when no
  one was within six feet of it.</p>

  <p>In Horatio Eddy's dark séances, where the complete absence of light gave
  the psychic power full scope, Olcott has testified that there were mad Indian
  war dances with the thudding of a dozen feet, and the wild playing of every
  instrument simultaneously, accompanied by yells and whoops. "As an exbibition
  of pure brute force," he says, "this Indian dance is probably unsurpassed in
  the annals of such manifestations." A light turned on would find all the
  instruments littered about the floor, and Horatio in a deep slumber, without
  a trace of perspiration, lying unconscious in his chair. Olcott assures us
  that he and other gentlemen present, whose names he gives, were permitted to
  sit on the medium, but that within a minute or two all the instruments were
  playing once again. After such an experiment all further experiences &mdash;
  and there were very many&mdash;seem to be beside the point. Short of
  wholesale and senseless lying on the part of Olcott and the other spectators,
  there can be no doubt that Horatio Eddy was exercising powers of which
  science was, and still is, very imperfectly acquainted.</p>

  <p>Some of Olcott's experiments were so definite, and are narrated so frankly
  and so clearly, that they deserve respectful consideration, and antedate the
  work of many of our modern researchers. For example, he brought from New York
  a balance which was duly tested as correct with a published certificate to
  that effect. He then persuaded one of the forms, the squaw Honto, to stand
  upon it, the actual weights being recorded by a third person, Mr. Pritchard,
  who was a reputable citizen and disinterested in the matter. Olcott gives his
  account of the results, and adds the certificate of Pritchard as sworn to
  before a magistrate. Honto was weighed four times, standing upon the platform
  so that she could not ease her weight in any way. She was a woman five feet
  three in height, and might be expected to register about 135 lb. The four
  results were actually 88, 58, 58, and 65 lb., all on the same evening. This
  seems to show that her body was a mere simulacrum which could vary in density
  from minute to minute. It showed also what was clearly brought out afterwards
  by Crawford, that the whole weight of the simulacrum cannot be derived from
  the medium. It is inconceivable that Eddy, who weighed 179 lb., was able to
  give up 88 of them. The whole circle, according to their capacity, which
  varies greatly, are called upon to contribute, and other elements may in all
  probability be drawn from the atmosphere. The highest actual loss of weight
  ever shown by Miss Goligher in the Crawford experiments was 52 lb., but each
  member of the circle was shown by the dials on the weighing chairs to have
  contributed some substance to the building of the ectoplasmic formations.</p>

  <p>Colonel Olcott also prepared two spring balances and tested the pulling
  power of the spirit hands, while those of the medium were held by one of the
  audience. A left hand pulled with a force of forty lb., and the right hand
  with fifty in a light which was so good that Olcott could clearly see that
  the right hand was one finger short. He was already familiar with the
  assertion of the spirit in question that he had been a sailor and had lost a
  finger in his lifetime. When one reads of such things the complaint of Olcott
  that his results were not final, and that he had not perfect test conditions,
  becomes more and more hard to comprehend. He winds up his conclusions,
  however, with the words: "No matter how many sceptics carne battering against
  these granitic facts, no matter what array of 'exposers' might blow their tin
  horns and penny trumpets, that Jericho would stand."</p>

  <p>One observation which Olcott made was that these ectoplasmic forms were
  quick to obey any mental order from a strong-minded sitter, coming and going
  as they were willed to do. Other observers in various séances have noted the
  same fact, and it may be taken as one of the fixed points in this baffling
  problem.</p>

  <p>There is one other curious point which probably escaped Olcott's notice.
  The mediums and the spirits who had been fairly amiable to him during his
  long visit turned suddenly very acid and repellent. This change seems to have
  occurred just after the arrival of Madame Blavatsky, with whom Olcott had
  struck up a close comradeship. Madame was, as stated, an ardent Spiritualist
  at the time, but it is at least possible that the spirits may have had
  foresight, and that they sensed danger from this Russian lady. Her
  theosophical teachings which were put forward in a year or two were to take
  the shape that, although the phenomena were real, the spirits were empty
  astral shells, and had no true life of their own. Whatever the true
  explanation, the change in the spirits was remarkable. "So far from the
  importance of my labour being recognized and all reasonable facilities
  afforded, I was kept constantly at a distance, as though I were an enemy
  instead of an unprejudiced observer."</p>

  <p>Colonel Olcott narrates many cases where the sitters have recognized
  spirits, but too much stress should not be laid upon this, as with a dim
  light and an emotional condition it is easy for an honest observer to be
  mistaken. The author has had the opportunity of gazing into the faces of at
  least a hundred of these images, and he can only recall two cases in which he
  was absolutely certain in his recognition. In both these cases the faces were
  self-illuminated, and he had not to depend upon the red lamp. There were two
  other occasions when, with the red lamp, he was morally certain, but in the
  vast majority of cases it was possible, if one allowed one's imagination to
  work, to read anything into the vague moulds which rose before one. It is
  likely that this occurred in the Eddy circle&mdash;indeed, C. C. Massey, a
  very competent judge, sitting with the Eddys in 1875, complained of the fact.
  The real miracle consisted not in the recognition but in the presence of the
  figure at all.</p>

  <p>There can be no doubt that the interest aroused by the Press accounts of
  the Eddy phenomena might have caused a more serious treatment of psychic
  science, and possibly advanced the cause of truth by a generation. Unhappily,
  at the very moment when the public attention was strongly drawn to the
  subject there came the real or imaginary scandal of the Holmeses at
  Philadelphia, which was vigorously exploited by the materialists, helped by
  the exaggerated honesty of Robert Dale Owen. The facts were as follows:</p>

  <p>Two mediums in Philadelphia, Mr. and Mrs. Nelson Holmes, had given a
  series of séances at which an alleged spirit had continually appeared, which
  took the name of Katie King, and professed to be the same as that with which
  Professor Crookes had experimented in London. On the face of it the assertion
  seemed most doubtful since the original Katie King had clearly stated that
  her mission was ended. However, apart from the identity of the spirit, there
  seemed to be good evidence that the phenomenon was genuine and not
  fraudulent, for it was most fully endorsed by Mr. Dale Owen, General Lippitt,
  and a number of other observers, who quoted personal experiences which were
  entirely beyond the reach of imposture.</p>

  <p>There was in Philadelphia at the time a Dr. Child, who plays a very
  ambiguous part in the obscure events which followed. Child had vouched for
  the genuine character of these phenomena in the most pronounced way. He had
  gone so far as to state in a pamphlet published in 1874 that the same John
  and Katie King, whom he had seen in the séance room, had come to him in his
  own private offices and had there dictated particulars of their earth life
  which he duly published. Such a statement must raise grave doubts in the mind
  of any psychic student, for a spirit form can only manifest from a medium,
  and there is no indication that Child was one. In any case one would imagine
  that, after such an assertion, Child was the last man in the world who could
  declare that the séances were fraudulent.</p>

  <p>Great public interest had been aroused in the séances by an article by
  General Lippitt in the Galaxy of December, 1874, and another by Dale Owen in
  <i>The Atlantic Monthly</i> of January, 1875. Then suddenly came the crash.
  It was heralded by a notice from Dale Owen, dated January 5, to the effect
  that evidence had been laid before him which compelled him to withdraw his
  previous expressions of confidence in the Holmeses. A similar card was issued
  by Dr. Child. Writing to Olcott, who after his Eddy investigation was
  recognized as an authority, Dale Owen said: "I believe they have been
  latterly playing us false, which may be only supplementing the genuine with
  the spurious, but it does cast a doubt on last summer's manifestations, so
  that I shall probably not use them in my next book on Spiritualism. It is a
  loss, but you and Mr. Crookes have amply made it up."</p>

  <p>Dale Owen's position is clear enough, since he was a man of sensitive
  honour, who was horrified at the idea that he could for one instant have
  certified an imposture to be a truth. His error seems to have lain in acting
  upon the first breath of suspicion instead of waiting until the facts were
  clear. Dr. Child's position is, however, more questionable, for if the
  manifestations were indeed fraudulent, how could he possibly have had
  interviews with the same spirits alone in his own private room?</p>

  <p>It was asserted now that a woman, whose name was not given, had been
  impersonating Katie King at these séances, that she had allowed her
  photograph to be taken and sold as Katie King, that she could produce the
  robes and ornaments worn by Katie King at the séances, and that she was
  prepared to make a full confession. Nothing could appear to be more damning
  and more complete. It was at this point that Olcott took up the
  investigation, and he seems to have been quite prepared to find that the
  general verdict was correct.</p>

  <p>His investigation soon revealed some facts, however, which threw fresh
  lights upon the matter and proved that psychic research in order to be
  accurate should examine "exposures" with the same critical care that it does
  phenomena. The name of the person who confessed that she had personated Katie
  King was revealed as Eliza White. In an account of the matter which she
  published, without giving the name, she declared that she had been born in
  1851, which would make her twenty-three years of age. She had married at
  fifteen and had one child eight years old. Her husband had died in 1872, and
  she had to keep herself and child. The Holmeses had come to lodge with her in
  March, 1874. In May they engaged her to personate a spirit. The cabinet had a
  false panel at the back through which she could slip, clad in a muslin robe.
  Mr. Dale Owen was invited to the séances and was completely taken in. All
  this caused violent twinges of her own conscience which did not prevent her
  from going to greater lengths and learning to fade away or re-form by the
  help of black cloths, and finally, of being photographed as Katie King.</p>

  <p>One day, according to her account, there came to her performance a man
  named Leslie, a railroad contractor. This gentleman showed his suspicions,
  and at a subsequent interview taxed her with her deceit, offering her
  pecuniary aid if she would confess to it. This she accepted, and then showed
  Leslie the methods of her impersonation. On December 5, a mock séance was
  held at which she rehearsed her part as played in the real séances, and this
  so impressed Dale Owen and also Dr. Child, both of whom were present, that
  they issued the notices in which they recanted their former belief&mdash;a
  recantation which was a staggering blow to those who had accepted Dale Owen's
  previous assurances, and who now claimed that he should have made some
  thorough investigation before issuing such a document. It was the more
  painful as Dale Owen was seventy-three years of age, and had been one of the
  most eloquent and painstaking of all the disciples of the new
  dispensation.</p>

  <p>Olcott's first task was to sift the record already given, and to get past
  the anonymity of the authoress. He soon discovered that she was, as already
  stated, Mrs. Eliza White, and that, though in Philadelphia, she refused to
  see him. The Holmeses, on the other hand, acted in a very open manner towards
  him and offered him every facility for examining their phenomena with such
  reasonable test conditions as he might desire. An examination of the past
  life of Eliza White showed that her statement, so far as it concerned her own
  story, was a tissue of lies. She was very much older than stated&mdash;not
  less than thirty-five&mdash;and it was doubtful whether she had ever been
  married to White at all. For years she had been a vocalist in a travelling
  show. White was still alive, so there was no question of widowhood. Olcott
  published the certificate of the Chief of the Police to that effect.</p>

  <p>Among other documents put forward by Colonel Olcott was one from a Mr.
  Allen, Justice of the Peace of New Jersey, given under oath. Eliza White,
  according to this witness, was "so untruthful that those to whom she spoke
  never knew when to believe her, and her moral reputation was as bad as bad
  could be." Judge Allen was able, however, to give some testimony which bore
  more directly upon the matter under discussion. He deposed that he had
  visited the Holmeses in Philadelphia, and had assisted Dr. Child to put up
  the cabinet, that it was solidly constructed, and that there was no
  possibility of any entrance being effected from behind, as alleged by Mrs.
  White. Further, that he was at a séance at which Katie King appeared, and
  that the proceedings had been disturbed by the singing of Mrs. White in
  another room, so that it was quite impossible that Mrs. White could, as she
  claimed, have acted an impersonation of the spirit. This being a sworn
  deposition by a justice of the Peace would seem to be a weighty piece of
  evidence.</p>

  <p>This cabinet seems to have been made in June, for General Lippitt, an
  excellent witness, described quite another arrangement on the occasion when
  he experimented. He says that two doors folded backwards, so as to touch each
  other, and the cabinet was simply the recess between these doors with a board
  over the top. "The first two or three evenings I made a careful examination,
  and once with a professional magician, who was perfectly satisfied that there
  was no chance of any trick." This was in May, so the two descriptions are not
  contradictory, save to Eliza White's claim that she could pass into the
  cabinet.</p>

  <p>In addition to these reasons for caution in forming an opinion, the
  Holmeses were able to produce letters written to them from Mrs. White in
  August, 1874, which were quite incompatible with there being any guilty
  secret between them. On the other hand, one of these letters did relate that
  efforts had been made to bribe her into a confession that she had been Katie
  King. Later in the year Mrs. White seems to have assumed a more threatening
  tone, as is sworn by the Holmeses in a formal affidavit, when she declared
  that unless they paid a rent which she claimed, there were a number of
  gentlemen of wealth, including members of the Young Men's Christian
  Association, who were ready to pay her a large sum of money, and she need not
  trouble the Holmeses any more. A thousand dollars was the exact sum which
  Eliza White was to get if she would consent to admit that she impersonated
  Katie King. It must surely be conceded that this statement, taken in
  conjunction with the woman's record, makes it very essential to demand
  corroboration for every assertion she might make.</p>

  <p>One culminating fact remains. At the very hour that the bogus séance was
  being held at which Mrs. White was showing how Katie King was impersonated,
  the Holmeses held a real séance, attended by twenty people, at which the
  spirit appeared the same as ever. Colonel Olcott collected several affidavits
  from those who were present on this occasion, and there can be no doubt about
  the fact. That of Dr. Adolphus Fellger is short, and may be given almost in
  full. He says under oath that "he has seen the spirit known as Katie King in
  all perhaps eighty times, is perfectly familiar with her features, and cannot
  mistake as to the identity of the Katie King who appeared upon the evening of
  December 5, for while the said spirit scarcely ever appeared of exactly the
  same height or features two evenings in succession, her voice was always the
  same, and the expression of her eyes, and the topics of her conversation
  enabled him to be still more certain of her being the same person." This
  Fellger was a well-known and highly respected Philadelphia physician, whose
  simple word, says Olcott, would outweigh "a score of affidavits of your Eliza
  Whites."</p>

  <p>It was also clearly shown that Katie King appeared constantly when Mrs.
  Holmes was at Blissfield and Mrs. White was in Philadelphia, and that Mrs.
  Holmes had written to Mrs. White describing their successful appearances,
  which seems a final proof that the latter was not a confederate.</p>

  <p>By this time one must admit that Mrs. White's anonymous confession is shot
  through and through with so many holes that it is in a sinking condition. But
  there is one part which, it seems to the author, will still float. That is
  the question of the photograph. It was asserted by the Holmeses in an
  interview with General Lippitt&mdash;whose word is a solid patch in this
  general quagmire&mdash;that Eliza White was hired by Dr. Child to pose in a
  photograph as Katie King. Child seems to have played a dubious part all
  through this business, making affirmations at different times which were
  quite contradictory, and having apparently some pecuniary interest in the
  matter. One is inclined, therefore, to look seriously into this charge, and
  to believe that the Holmeses may have been party to the fraud. Granting that
  the Katie King image was real, they may well have doubted whether it could be
  photographed, since dim light was necessary for its production. On the other
  hand, there was clearly a source of revenue if photographs at half a dollar
  each could be sold to the numerous sitters. Colonel Olcott in his book
  produces a photograph of Mrs. White alongside of the one which was supposed
  to be Katie King, and claims that there is no resemblance. It is clear,
  however, that the photographer would be asked to touch up the negative so as
  to conceal the resemblance, otherwise the fraud would be obvious. The author
  has the impression, though not the certainty, that the two faces are the same
  with just such changes as manipulation would produce. Therefore he thinks
  that the photograph may well be a fraud, but that this by no means
  corroborates the rest of Mrs. White's narrative, though it would shake our
  faith in the character of Mr. and Mrs. Holmes as well as of Dr. Child. But
  the character of physical mediums has really only an indirect bearing upon
  the question of the reality of their psychic powers, which should be tested
  upon their own merits whether the individual be saint or sinner.</p>

  <p>Colonel Olcott's wise conclusion was that, as the evidence was so
  conflicting, he would put it all to one side and test the mediums in his own
  way with out reference to what was past. This he did in a very convincing
  way, and it is impossible for anyone who reads his investigation ("People
  From the Other World," p. 460 and onwards) to deny that he took every
  possible precaution against fraud. The cabinet was netted at the sides so
  that no one could enter as Mrs. White claimed to have done. Mrs. Holmes was
  herself put into a bag which tied round the neck and, as her husband was
  away, she was confined to her own resources. Under these circumstances
  numerous heads were formed, some of which were semi-materialized, presenting
  a somewhat terrible appearance. This may have been done as a test, or it may
  have been that the long contention had impaired the powers of the medium. The
  faces were made to appear at a level which the medium could in no case have
  reached. Dale Owen was present at this demonstration and must have already
  begun to regret his premature declaration.</p>

  <p>Further séances with similar results were then held in Olcott's own rooms,
  so as to preclude the possibility of some ingenious mechanism under the
  control of the medium. On one occasion, when the head of John King, the
  presiding spirit, appeared in the air, Olcott, remembering Eliza White's
  assertion that these faces were merely ten cent masks, asked and obtained
  permission to pass his stick all round it, and so satisfied himself that it
  was not supported. This experiment seems so final that the reader who desires
  even more evidence may be referred to the book where he will find much. It
  was perfectly clear that whatever part Eliza White may have played in the
  photograph, there was not a shadow of a doubt that Mrs. Holmes was a genuine
  and powerful medium for material phenomena. It should be added that the Katie
  King head was repeatedly seen by the investigators, though the whole form
  appears only once to have been materialized. General Lippitt was present at
  these experiments and associated himself publicly (<i>Banner Of Light</i>,
  February 6, 1875) with Olcott's conclusions.</p>

  <p>The author has dwelt at some length upon this case, as it is very typical
  of the way in which the public has been misled over Spiritualism. The papers
  are full of an "exposure." It is investigated and is shown to be either quite
  false or very partially true. This is not reported, and the public is left
  with the original impression uncorrected. Even now, when one mentions Katie
  King, one hears some critic say: "Oh, she was shown to be a fraud in
  Philadelphia," and by a natural confusion of thought this has even been
  brought as an argument against Crookes's classical experiments. The affair
  &mdash;especially the temporary weakening of Dale Owen&mdash;set the cause of
  Spiritualism back by many years in America.</p>

  <p>Mention has been made of John King, the presiding spirit at the Holmes
  séances. This strange entity would appear to have been the chief controller
  of all physical phenomena in the early days of the movement, and is still
  occasionally to be seen and heard. His name is associated with the Koons's
  music saloon, with the Davenport brothers, with Williams in London, with Mrs.
  Holmes, and many others. In person when materialized he presents the
  appearance of a tall, swarthy man with a noble head and a full black beard.
  His voice is loud and deep, while his rap has a decisive character of its
  own. He is master of all languages, having been tested in the most
  out-of-the-way tongues, such as Georgian, and never having been found
  wanting. This formidable person controls the bands of lesser primitive
  spirits, Red Indians and others, who assist at such phenomena. He claims that
  Katie King is his daughter, and that he was himself when in life Henry
  Morgan, the buccaneer who was pardoned and knighted by Charles II and ended
  as Governor of Jamaica. If so, he has been a most cruel ruffian and has much
  to expiate. The author is bound to state, however, that he has in his
  possession a contemporary picture of Henry Morgan (it will be found in Howard
  Pyle's "Buccaneers," p. 178), and that if reliable it has no resemblance to
  John King. All these questions of earthly identity are very obscure.*</p>

  <p class="footnote">* As the author has given a point against the identity of
  John King with Morgan, it is only fair that he should give one which supports
  it and comes to him almost first-hand from a reliable source. The daughter of
  a recent Governor of Jamaica was at a séance in London lately, and was
  confronted with John King. The King spirit said to her, "You have brought
  back from Jamaica something which was mine." She said, "What was it?" He
  answered, "My will." It was a fact, quite unknown to the company, that her
  father had brought back this document.</p>

  <p>Before closing the account of Olcott's experiences at this stage of his
  evolution, some notice should be taken of the so-called Compton
  transfiguration case, which shows what deep waters we are in when we attempt
  psychic research. These particular waters have not been plumbed yet, nor in
  any way charted. Nothing can be clearer than the facts, or more satisfactory
  than the evidence. The medium Mrs. Compton was shut up in her small cabinet,
  and thread passed through the bored holes in her ears and fastened to the
  back of her chair. Presently a slim white figure emerged from the cabinet.
  Olcott had a weighing platform provided, and on it the spirit figure stood.
  Twice it was weighed, the records being 77 lb. and 59 lb. Olcott then, as
  prearranged, went into the cabinet leaving the figure outside. The medium was
  gone. The chair was there, but there was no sign of the woman. Olcott then
  turned back and again weighed the apparition, who this time scaled 52 lb. The
  spirit then returned into the cabinet from which other figures emerged.
  Finally, Olcott says:</p>

  <p class="quote">I went inside with a lamp and found the medium just as I
left her at the
  beginning of the séance, with every thread unbroken and every seal
  undisturbed! She sat there, with her head leaning against the wall, her flesh
  as pale and as cold as marble, her eyeballs turned up beneath the lids, her
  forehead covered with a death-like damp, no breath coming from her lungs and
  no pulse at her wrist. When every person had examined the threads and seals,
  I cut the flimsy bonds with a pair of scissors, and, lifting the chair by its
  back and seat, carried the cataleptic woman out into the open air of the
  chamber.</p>

  <p class="quote">She lay thus inanimate for eighteen minutes; life gradually
coming back to
  her body, until respiration and pulse and the temperature of her skin became
  normal... I then put her upon the scale... She weighed one hundred and
  twenty-one pounds!</p>

  <p>What are we to make of such a result as that? There were eleven witnesses
  besides Olcott himself. The facts seem to be beyond dispute. But what are we
  to deduce from such facts? The author has seen a photograph, taken in the
  presence of an amateur medium, where every detail of the room has come out
  but the sitter has vanished. Is the disappearance of the medium in some way
  analogous to that? If the ectoplasmic figure weighed only 77 lb. and the
  medium 121 lb., then it is clear that only 44 lb. of her were left when the
  phantom was out. If 44 lb. were not enough to continue the processes of life,
  may not her guardians have used their subtle occult chemistry in order to
  dematerialize her and so save her from all danger until the return of the
  phantom would enable her to reassemble? It is a strange supposition, but it
  seems to meet the facts&mdash;which cannot be done by mere blank, unreasoning
  incredulity.</p>

     id="chap13">XIII. &mdash; HENRY SLADE AND DR. MONCK</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IT is impossible to record the many mediums of various
  shades of power, and occasionally of honesty, who have demonstrated the
  effects which outside intelligences can produce when the material conditions
  are such as to enable them to manifest upon this plane. There are a few,
  however, who have been so pre-eminent and so involved in public polemics that
  no history of the movement can disregard them, even if their careers have not
  been in all ways above suspicion. We shall deal in this chapter with the
  histories of Slade and Monck, both of whom played a prominent part in their
  days.</p>

  <p>Henry Slade, the celebrated slate-writing medium, had been before the
  public in America for fifteen years before he arrived in London on July 13,
  1876. Colonel H. S. Olcott, a former president of the Theosophical Society,
  states that he and Madame Blavatsky were responsible for Slade's visit to
  England. It appears that the Grand Duke Constantine of Russia, desiring to
  make a scientific investigation of Spiritualism, a committee of professors of
  the Imperial University of St. Petersburg requested Colonel Olcott and Madame
  Blavatsky to select out of the best American mediums one whom they could
  recommend for tests.</p>

  <p class="caption">Henry Slade.</p>

  <p>They chose Slade, after submitting him to exacting tests for several weeks
  before a committee of sceptics, who in their report certified that "messages
  were written inside double slates, sometimes tied and sealed together, while
  they either lay upon the table in full view of all, or were laid upon the
  heads of members of the committee, or held flat against the under surface of
  the table-top, or held in a committeeman's hand without the medium touching
  it." It was en route to Russia that Slade came to England.</p>

  <p>A representative of the London <i>World</i>, who had a sitting with Slade
soon
  after his arrival, thus describes him: "A highly-wrought, nervous
  temperament, a dreamy, mystical face, regular features, eyes luminous with
  expression, a rather sad smile, and a certain melancholy grace of manner,
  were the impressions conveyed by the tall, lithe figure introduced to me as
  Dr. Slade. He is the sort of man you would pick out of a roomful as an
  enthusiast." The Seybert Commission Report says, "he is probably six feet in
  height, with a figure of unusual symmetry," and that "his face would attract
  notice anywhere for its uncommon beauty," and sums him up as "a noteworthy
  man in every respect."</p>

  <p>Directly after his arrival in London Slade began to give sittings at his
  lodgings in 8 Upper Bedford Place, Russell Square, and his success was
  immediate and pronounced. Not only was writing obtained of an evidential
  nature, under test conditions, with the sitter's own slates, but the
  levitation of objects and materialized hands were observed in strong
  sunlight.</p>

  <p>The editor of <i>The Spiritual Magazine</i>, the soberest and most
  high-class of the Spiritualist periodicals of the time, wrote: "We have no
  hesitation in saying that Dr. Slade is the most remarkable medium of modern
  times."</p>

  <p>Mr. J. Enmore Jones, a well-known psychic researcher of that day, who
  afterwards edited <i>The Spiritual Magazine</i>, said that Slade was taking
  the place vacated by D.D. Home. His account of his first sitting indicates
  the business-like method of procedure: "In Mr. Home's case, he refused to
  take fees, and as a rule the sittings were in the evening in the quiet of
  domestic life; but in Dr. Slade's case it was any time during the day, in one
  of the rooms he occupies at a boarding-house. The fee of twenty shillings is
  charged, and he prefers that only one person be present in the large room he
  uses. No time is lost; as soon as the visitor sits down the incidents
  commence, are continued, and in, say, fifteen minutes are ended." Stainton
  Moses, who was afterwards the first president of the London Spiritualist
  Alliance, conveys the same idea with regard to Slade. He wrote: "In his
  presence phenomena occur with a regularity and precision, with an absence of
  regard for 'conditions,' and with a facility for observation which satisfy my
  desires entirely. It is impossible to conceive circumstances more favourable
  to minute investigation than those under which I witnessed the phenomena
  which occur in his presence with such startling rapidity... There was no
  hesitation, no tentative experiments. All was short, sharp, and decisive. The
  invisible operators knew exactly what they were going to do, and did it with
  promptitude and precision."*</p>

  <p class="footnote">* <i>The Spiritualist</i>, Vol. IX, p. 2.</p>

  <p>Slade's first séance in England was given on July 15, 1876, to Mr. Charles
  Blackburn, a prominent Spiritualist, and Mr. W. H. Harrison, editor of <i>The
  Spiritualist</i>. In strong sunlight the medium and the two sitters occupied
  three sides of an ordinary table about four feet square. A vacant chair was
  placed at the fourth side. Slade put a tiny piece of pencil, about the size
  of a grain of wheat, upon a slate, and held the slate by one corner with one
  hand under the table flat against the leaf. Writing was heard on the slate,
  and on examination a short message was found to have been written. While this
  was taking place the four hands of the sitters and Slade's disengaged hands
  were clasped in the centre of the table. Mr. Blackburn's chair was moved four
  or five inches while he was sitting upon it, and no one but himself was
  touching it. The unoccupied chair at the fourth side of the table once jumped
  in the air, striking its seat against the under edge of the table. Twice a
  life-like hand passed in front of Mr. Blackburn while both Slade's hands were
  under observation. The medium held an accordion under the table, and while
  his other hand was in clear view on the table "Hone, Sweet Home" was played.
  Mr. Blackburn then held the accordion in the same way, when the instrument
  was drawn out strongly and one note sounded. While this occurred Slade's
  hands were on the table. Finally, the three present raised their hands a foot
  above the table, and it rose until it touched their hands. At another sitting
  on the same day a chair rose about four feet, when no one was touching it,
  and when Slade rested one hand on the top of Miss Blackburn's chair, she and
  the chair were raised about half a yard from the floor.</p>

  <p>Mr. Stainton Moses thus describes an early sitting which he had with
  Slade:</p>

  <p class="quote">A midday sun, hot enough to roast one, was pouring into the
room; the
  table was uncovered; the medium sat with the whole of his body in full view;
  there was no human being present save myself and him. What conditions could
  be better? The raps were instantaneous and loud, as if made by the clenched
  fist of a powerful man. The slate-writing occurred under any suggested
  condition. It came on a slate held by Dr. Slade and myself; on one held by
myself
  alone in the corner of the table farthest from the medium; on a slate which I
  had myself brought with me, and which I held myself. The latter writing
  occupied some time in production, and the grating noise of the pencil in
  forming each word was distinctly audible. A chair opposite to me was raised
  some eighteen inches from the floor; my slate was taken out of my hand, and
  produced at the opposite side of the table, where neither Dr. Slade nor I
  could reach it; the accordion played all round and about me, while the doctor
  held it by the lower part, and finally, on a touch from his hand upon the
  back of my chair, I was levitated, chair and all, some inches.</p>

  <p>Mr. Stainton Moses was himself a powerful medium, and this fact doubtless
  aided the conditions. He adds:</p>

  <p class="quote">I have seen all these phenomena and many others several
times before, but
  I never saw them occur rapidly and consecutively in broad daylight. The whole
  séance did not extend over more than half an hour, and no cessation of the
  phenomena occurred from first to last.*</p>

  <p class="footnote">* <i>The Spiritualist</i>, Vol. IX, p. 2.</p>

  <p>All went well for six weeks, and London was full of curiosity as to the
  powers of Slade, when there came an awkward interruption.</p>

  <p>Early in September, 1876, Professor Ray Lankester with Dr. Donkin had two
  sittings with Slade, and on the second occasion, seizing the slate, he found
  writing on it when none was supposed to have taken place. He was entirely
  without experience in psychic research, or he would have known that it is
  impossible to say at what moment writing occurs in such séances. Occasionally
  a whole sheet of writing seems to be precipitated in an instant, while at
  other times the author has clearly heard the pencil scratching along from
  line to line. To Ray Lankester, however, it seemed a clear case of fraud, and
  he wrote a letter to <i>The Times</i>* denouncing Slade, and also prosecuted
  him for obtaining money under false pretences. Replies to Lankester's letter
  and supporting Slade were forthcoming from Dr, Alfred Russel Wallace,
  Professor Barrett, and others. Dr. Wallace pointed out that Professor
  Lankester's account of what happened was so completely unlike what occurred
  during his own visit to the medium, as well as the recorded experience of
  Serjeant Cox, Dr. Carter Blake, and many others, that he could only look upon
  it as a striking example of Dr. Carpenter's theory of preconceived ideas, He
  says: "Professor Lankester went with the firm conviction that all he was
  going to see would be imposture, and he believes he saw imposture
  accordingly." Professor Lankester showed his bias when, referring to the
  paper read before the British Association on September 12 by Professor
  Barrett, in which he dealt with Spiritualistic phenomena, he said, in his
  letter to <i>The Times</i>: "The discussions of the British Association have
  been degraded by the introduction of Spiritualism."</p>

  <p class="footnote">* September 16, 1876.</p>

  <p>Professor Barrett wrote that Slade had a ready reply, based on his
  ignorance of when the writing did actually occur. He describes a very
  evidential sitting he had in which the slate rested on the table with his
  elbow resting on it. One of Slade's hands was held by him, and the fingers of
  the medium's other hand rested lightly on the surface of the slate. In this
  way writing occurred on the under surface of the slate. Professor Barrett
  further speaks of an eminent scientific friend who obtained writing on a
  clean slate when it was held entirely by him, both of the medium's hands
  being on the table. Such instances must surely seem absolutely conclusive to
  the unbiased reader, and it will be clear that if the positive is firmly
  established, occasional allegations of negative have no bearing upon the
  general conclusion.</p>

  <p>Slade's trial came on at Bow Street Police Court on October t, 1876,
  before Mr. Flowers, the magistrate. Mr. George Lewis prosecuted and Mr.
  Munton appeared for the defence. Evidence in favour of the genuineness of
  Slade's mediumship was given by Dr. Alfred Russel Wallace, Serjeant Cox, Dr.
  George Wyld, and one other, only four witnesses being allowed. The magistrate
  described the testimony as "overwhelming" as to the evidence for the
  phenomena, but in giving judgment he excluded everything but the evidence of
  Lankester and his friend Dr. Donkin, saying that he must base his decision on
  "inferences to be drawn from the known course of nature." A statement made by
  Mr. Maskelyne, the well-known conjurer, that the table used by Slade was a
  trick-table was disproved by the evidence of the workman who made it. This
  table can now be seen at the offices of the London Spiritualist Alliance, and
  one marvels at the audacity of a witness who could imperil another man's
  liberty by so false a statement, which must have powerfully affected the
  course of the trial. Indeed, in the face of the evidence of Ray Lankester,
  Donkin, and Maskelyne, it is hard to see how Mr. Flowers could fail to
  convict, for he would say with truth and reason, "What is before the Court is
  not what has happened upon other occasions&mdash;however convincing these
  eminent witnesses may be&mdash;but what occurred upon this particular
  occasion, and here we have two witnesses on one side and only the prisoner on
  the other." The "trick-table" probably settled the matter.</p>

  <p>Slade was sentenced, under the Vagrancy Act, to three months' imprisonment
  with hard labour. An appeal was lodged and he was released on bail. When the
  appeal came to be heard, the conviction was quashed on a technical point. It
  may be pointed out that though he escaped on a technical point, namely, that
  the words "by palmistry or otherwise" which appeared in the statute had been
  omitted, it must not be assumed that had the technical point failed he might
  not have escaped on the merits of his case. Slade, whose health had been
  seriously affected by the strain of the trial, left England for the Continent
  a day or two later. From the Hague, after a rest of a few months, Slade wrote
  to Professor Lankester offering to return to London and to give him
  exhaustive private tests on condition that he could come without molestation.
  He received no answer to his suggestion, which surely is not that of a guilty
  man.</p>

  <p>An illuminated testimonial to Slade from London Spiritualists in 1877 sets
  out:</p>

  <p class="quote">In view of the deplorable termination of Henry Slade's
visit to this
  country, we the undersigned desire to place on record our high opinion of his
  mediumship, and our reprobation of the treatment he has undergone.</p>

  <p class="quote">We regard Henry Slade as one of the most valuable Test
Mediums now living.
  The phenomena which occur in his presence are evolved with a rapidity and
  regularity rarely equalled....</p>

  <p class="quote">He leaves us not only untarnished in reputation by the late
proceedings in
  our Law Courts, but with a mass of testimony in his favour which could
  probably have been elicited in no other way.</p>

  <p>This is signed by Mr. Alexander Calder (President of the British National
  Association of Spiritualists) and a number of representative Spiritualists.
  Unhappily, however, it is the Noes, not the Ayes, which have the ear of the
  Press, and even now, fifty years later, it would be hard to find a paper
  enlightened enough to do the man justice.</p>

  <p>Spiritualists, however, showed great energy in supporting Slade. Before
  the trial a Defence Fund was raised, and Spiritualists in America drew up a
  memorial to the American Minister in London. Between the Bow Street
  conviction and the hearing of the appeal, a memorial was sent to the Home
  Secretary protesting against the action of the Government in conducting the
  prosecution on appeal. Copies of this were sent to all the members of the
  Legislature, to all the Middlesex magistrates, to various members of the
  Royal Society, and of other public bodies. Miss Kislingbury, the secretary to
  the National Association of Spiritualists, forwarded a copy to the Queen.</p>

  <p>After giving successful séances at the Hague, Slade went to Berlin in
  November, 1877, where he created the keenest interest. He was said to know no
  German, yet messages in German appeared on the slates, and were written in
  the characters of the fifteenth century. The <i>Berliner Fremdenblatt</i> of
  November 10, 1877, wrote: "Since the arrival of Mr. Slade at the Kronprinz
  Hotel the greater portion of the educated world of Berlin has been suffering
  from an epidemic which we may term a Spiritualistic fever." Describing his
  experiences in Berlin, Slade said that he began by fully converting the
  landlord of the hotel, using the latter's slates and tables in his own house.
  The landlord invited the Chief of Police and many prominent citizens of
  Berlin to witness the manifestations, and they expressed themselves as
  satisfied. Slade writes: "Samuel Bellachini, Court Conjurer to the Emperor of
  Germany, had a week's experience with me free of charge. I gave him from two
  to three séances a day and one of them at his own house. After his full and
  complete investigation, he went to a public notary and made oath that the
  phenomena were genuine and not trickery."</p>

  <p>Bellachini's declaration on oath, which has been published, bears out this
  statement. He says that after the minutest investigation he considers any
  explanation by conjuring to be "absolutely impossible." The conduct of
  conjurers seems to have been usually determined by a sort of trade union
  jealousy, as if the results of the medium were some sort of breach of a
  monopoly, but this enlightened German, together with Houdin, Kellar, and a
  few more, have shown a more open mind.</p>

  <p>A visit to Denmark followed, and in December began the historic séances
  with Professor Zollner, at Leipzig. A full account of these will be found in
  Zollner's "Transcendental Physics," which has been translated by Mr. C. C.
  Massey. Zollner was Professor of Physics and Astronomy in the University of
  Leipzig, and associated with him in the experiments with Slade were other
  scientific men, including William Edward Weber, Professor of Physics;
  Professor Scheibner, a distinguished mathematician; Gustave Theodore Fechner,
  Professor of Physics and an eminent natural philosopher, who were all, says
  Professor Zollner, "perfectly convinced of the reality of the observed facts,
  altogether excluding imposture or "prestidigitation." The phenomena in
  question included, among other things, "the production of true knots in an
  endless string, the rending of Professor Zollner's bed-screen, the
  disappearance of a small table and its subsequent descent from the ceiling in
  <i>full light</i>, in a private house and under the observed conditions, of
  which the most noticeable is the apparent passivity of Dr. Slade during all
  these occurrences."</p>

  <p>Certain critics have tried to indicate what they consider insufficient
  precautions observed in these experiments. Dr. J. Maxwell, the acute French
  critic, makes an excellent reply to such objections. He points out* that
  because skilled and conscientious psychic investigators have omitted to
  indicate explicitly in their reports that every hypothesis of fraud has been
  studied and dismissed, in the belief that "their implicit affirmation of the
  reality of the fact appeared sufficient to them," and in order to prevent
  their reports from being too unwieldy, yet captious critics do not hesitate
  to condemn them and to suggest possibilities of fraud which are quite
  inadmissible under the observed conditions.</p>

  <p class="footnote">* <i>Metapsychical Phenomena</i> (Translation 1905), p.
  405.</p>

  <p>Zollner gave a dignified reply to the supposition that he was tricked in
  these cord-tying experiments: "If, nevertheless, the foundation of this fact,
  deduced by me on the ground of an enlarged conception of space, should be
  denied, only one other kind of explanation would remain, arising from a moral
  code of consideration that at present, it is true, is quite customary. This
  explanation would consist in the presumption that I myself and the honourable
  men and citizens of Leipzig, in whose presence several of these cords were
  sealed, were either common impostors, or were not in possession of our sound
  senses sufficient to perceive if Mr. Slade himself, before the cords were
  sealed, had tied them in knots. The discussion, however, of such a hypothesis
  would no longer belong to the dominion of science, but would fall under the
  category of social decency."*</p>

  <p class="footnote">* Massey's <i>Zollner</i>, pp. 20-21.</p>

  <p>As a sample of the reckless statements of opponents of Spiritualism, it
  may be mentioned that Mr. Joseph McCabe, who is second only to the American
  Houdini for wild inaccuracies, speaks of Zollner* as "an elderly and purblind
  professor," whereas he died in 1882, in his forty-eighth year, and his
  experiments with Slade were carried out in 1877-78, when this distinguished
  scientist was in the vigour of his intellectual life.</p>

  <p class="footnote">"Spiritualism. A Popular History from 1847," p. 161.</p>

  <p>So far have opponents pushed their enmity that it has even been stated
  that Zollner was deranged, and that his death which occurred some years later
  was accompanied with cerebral weakness. An inquiry from Dr. Funk set this
  matter at rest, though it is unfortunately easy to get libels of this sort
  into circulation and very difficult to get the contradictions. Here is the
  document:*</p>

  <p class="quote">Your letter addressed to the Rector of the University,
October 20, 1903,
  received. The Rector of this University was installed here after the death of
  Zollner, and had no personal acquaintance with him; but information received
  from Zollner's colleagues states that during his entire studies at the
  University here, until his death, he was of sound mind; moreover, in the best
  of health. The cause of his death was a hemorrhage of the brain on the
  morning of April 25th, 1882, while he was at breakfast with his mother, and
  from which he died shortly after. It is true that Professor Zollner was an
  ardent believer in Spiritualism, and as such was in close relations with
  Slade.</p>

  <p class="quote">(Dr.) KARL BUCHER, Professor of Statistics and National
Economy at the
  University.</p>

  <p class="footnote">"The Widow's Mite," p. 276.</p>

  <p>The tremendous power which occasionally manifests itself when the
  conditions are favourable was shown once in the presence of Zollner, Weber,
  and Scheibner, all three professors of the University. There was a strong
  wooden screen on one side of the room:</p>

  <p class="quote">A violent crack was suddenly heard as in the discharging of
a large
  battery of Leyden jars. On turning with some alarm in the direction of the
  sound, the before-mentioned screen fell apart in two pieces. The strong
  wooden screws, half an inch thick, were torn from above and below, without
  any visible contact of Slade with the screen. The parts broken were at least
  five feet removed from Slade, who had his back to the screen; but even if he
  had intended to tear it down by a cleverly devised sideward motion, it would
  have been necessary to fasten it on the opposite side. As it was, the screen
  stood quite unattached, and the grain of the wood being parallel to the axis
  of the cylindrical wooden fastenings, the wrenching asunder could only be
  accomplished by a force acting longitudinally to the part in question. We
  were all astonished at this unexpected and violent manifestation of
  mechanical force, and asked Slade what it all meant; but he only shrugged his
  shoulders, saying that such phenomena occasionally, though somewhat rarely,
  occurred in his presence. As he spoke, he placed, while still standing, a
  piece of slate-pencil on the polished surface of the table, laid over it a
  slate, purchased and just cleaned by myself, and pressed the five spread
  fingers of his right hand on the upper surface of the slate, while his left
  hand rested on the centre of the table. Writing began on the inner surface of
  the slate, and when Slade turned it up, the following sentence was written in
  English: "It was not our intention to do harm. Forgive what has happened." We
  were the more surprised at the production of the writing under these
  circumstances, for we particularly observed that both Slade's hands remained
  quite motionless while the writing was going on.*</p>

  <p class="footnote">* <i>Transcendental Physics</i>, p. 34, 35.</p>

  <p>In his desperate attempt to explain this incident, Mr. McCabe says that no
  doubt the screen was broken before and fastened together afterwards with
  thread. There is truly no limit to the credulity of the incredulous.</p>

  <p>After a very successful series of séances in St. Petersburg, Slade
  returned to London for a few days in 1878, and then proceeded to Australia.
  An interesting account of his work there is to be found in Mr. James Curtis's
  book, "Rustlings in the Golden City." Then he returned to America. In 1885 he
  appeared before the Seybert Commission in Philadelphia, and in 1887 again
  visited England under the name of "Dr. Wilson," though it was well known who
  he was. Presumably his alias was due to a fear that the old proceedings would
  be renewed.</p>

  <p>At most of his séances, Slade exhibited clairvoyant powers, and
  materialized hands were a familiar occurrence. In Australia, where psychic
  conditions are good, he had materializations. Mr. Curtis says that the medium
  objected to sitting for this form of manifestation, because it left him weak
  for a time, and because he preferred to give séances in the light. He
  consented, however, to try with Mr. Curtis, who thus describes what took
  place at Ballarat, in Victoria:</p>

  <p class="quote">Our first test of spirit appearance in the form took place
at Lester's
  Hotel. I placed the table about four or five feet from the west wall of the
  room. Mr. Slade sat at the end of the table furthest from the wall, whilst I
  took my position on the north side. The gaslight was toned down, not so much
  but that any object in the room could be clearly seen. Our hands were placed
  over one another in a single pile. We sat very still about ten minutes, when
  I observed something like a little misty cloud between myself and the wall.
  When my attention was first drawn towards this phenomenon, it was about the
  size and colour of a gentleman's high-crowned, whitish-grey felt hat. This
  cloudlike appearance rapidly grew and became transformed, when we saw before
  us a woman&mdash;a lady. The being thus fashioned, and all but perfected,
  rose from the floor on to the top of the table, where I could most distinctly
  observe the configuration. The arms and hands were elegantly shaped; the
  forehead, mouth, nose, cheeks, and beautiful brown hair showed harmoniously,
  each part in concord with the whole. Only the eyes were veiled because they
  could not be completely materialized. The feet were encased in white satin
  shoes. The dress glowed in light, and was the most beautiful I ever beheld,
  the colour being bright, sheeny silvery grey, or greyish shining white. The
  whole figure was graceful, and the drapery perfect. The materialized spirit
  glided and walked about, causing the table to shake, vibrate, jerk and tilt
  considerably. I could hear, too, the rustling of the dress as the celestial
  visitant transiently wended from one position or place to another. The spirit
  form, within two feet of our unmoved hands, still piled up together in a
  heap, then dissolved, and gradually faded from our vision.</p>

  <p>The conditions at this beautiful séance&mdash;with the medium's hands held
  throughout, and with enough light for visibility&mdash;seem satisfactory,
  provided we grant the honesty of the witness. As the preface contains the
  supporting testimony of a responsible Australian Government official, who
  also speaks of Mr. Curtis's initial extremely sceptical state of mind, we may
  well do so. At the same séance a quarter of an hour later the figure again
  appeared:</p>

  <p class="quote">The apparition then floated in the air and alighted on the
table, rapidly
  glided about, and thrice bent her beautiful figure with graceful bows, each
  bending deliberate and low, the head coming within six inches of my face. The
  dress rustled (as silk rustles) with every movement. The face was partially
  veiled as before. The visibility then became invisible, slowly disappearing
  like the former materialization.</p>

  <p>Other similar séances are described.</p>

  <p>In view of the many elaborate and stringent tests through which he passed
  successfully, the story of Slade's "exposure" in America in 1886 is not
  convincing, but we refer to it for historical reasons, and to show that such
  incidents are not excluded from our review of the subject. <i>The Boston
  Herald</i>, February 2, 1886, heads its account, "The celebrated Dr. Slade
  comes to grief in Weston, West Virginia, writes upon slates which lie upon
  his knees under the table, and moves tables and chairs with his toes."
  Observers in an adjoining room, looking through the crevice under the door
  saw these feats of agility being performed by the medium, though those
  present in the room with him were unaware of them. There seems, however, to
  have been in this as in other cases, occurrences which bore the appearance of
  fraud, and Spiritualists were among those who denounced him. At a subsequent
  public performance for "Direct Spirit Writing" in the Justice Hall, Weston,
  Mr. E. S. Barrett, described as a "Spiritualist," came forward and explained
  how Slade's imposture had been detected. Slade, who was asked to speak,
  appeared dumbfounded, and could only say, according to the report, that if
  his accusers had been deceived he had been equally so, for if the deceit had
  been done by him, it had been without his consciousness.</p>

  <p>Mr. J. Simmons, Slade's business manager, made a frank statement which
  seems to point to the operation of ectoplasmic limbs, as years later was
  proved to be the case with the famous Italian medium, Eusapia Palladino. He
  says: "I do not doubt that these gentlemen saw what they assert they did; but
  I am convinced at the same time that Slade is as innocent of what he is
  accused of as you (the editor) yourself would have been under similar
  circumstances. But I know that my explanation would have no weight in a court
  of justice. I myself saw a hand, which I could have sworn to be that of
  Slade, if it had been possible for his hand to be in that position. While one
  of his hands lay upon the table and the other held the slate under the corner
  of the table, a third hand appeared with a clothes-brush (which a moment
  previously had brushed against me from the knee upwards) in the middle of the
  opposite edge of the table, which was forty-two inches long." Slade and his
  manager were arrested and released on bail, but no further proceedings seem
  to have been taken against them. Truesdell, also, in his book, "Spiritualism,
  Bottom Facts," states that he saw Slade effecting the movement of objects
  with his foot, and he asks his readers to believe that the medium made to him
  a full confession of how all his manifestations were produced. If Slade ever
  really did this, it may probably be accounted for by a burst of ill-timed
  levity on his part in seeking to fool a certain type of investigator by
  giving him exactly what he was seeking for. To such instances we may apply
  the judgment of Professor Zollner on the Lankester incident: "The physical
  facts observed by us in so astonishing a variety in his presence negatived on
  every reasonable ground the supposition that he in one solitary case had
  taken refuge in wilful imposture." He adds, what was certainly the case in
  that particular instance, that Slade was the victim of his accuser's and his
  judge's limited knowledge.</p>

  <p>At the same time there is ample evidence that Slade degenerated in general
  character towards the latter part of his life. Promiscuous sittings with a
  mercenary object, the subsequent exhaustions, and the alcoholic stimulus
  which affords a temporary relief, all acting upon a most sensitive
  organization, had a deleterious effect. This weakening of character, with a
  corresponding loss of health, may have led to a diminution of his psychic
  powers, and increased the temptation to resort to trickery. Making every
  allowance for the difficulty of distinguishing what is fraud and what is of
  crude psychic origin, an unpleasant impression is left upon the mind by the
  evidence given in the Seybert Commission and by the fact that Spiritualists
  upon the spot should have condemned his action. Human frailty, however, is
  one thing and psychic power is another. Those who seek evidence for the
  latter will find ample in those years when the man and his powers were both
  at their zenith.</p>

  <p>Slade died in 1905 at a Michigan sanatorium to which he had been sent by
  the American Spiritualists, and the announcement was followed by the
  customary sort of comment in the London Press. <i>The Star</i>, which has an
  evil tradition in psychic matters, printed a sensational article headed
  "Spook Swindles," giving a garbled account of the Lankester prosecution at
  Bow Street. Referring to this, <i>Light</i> says*:</p>

  <p class="quote">Of course, this whole thing is a hash of ignorance,
unfairness and
  prejudice. We do not care to discuss it or to controvert it. It would be
  useless to do so for the sake of the unfair, the ignorant, and the
  prejudiced, and it is not necessary for those who know. Suffice it to say
  that <i>The Star</i> only supplies one more instance of the difficulty of
  getting all the facts before the public; but the prejudiced newspapers have
  themselves to blame for their ignorance or inaccuracy.</p>

  <p class="footnote">* 1886, p. 433.</p>

  <p>It is the story of the Davenport Brothers and Maskelyne over again.</p>

  <p>If Slade's career is difficult to appraise, and if one is forced to admit
  that while there was an overpowering preponderance of psychic results, there
  was also a residuum which left the unpleasant impression that the medium
  might supplement truth with fraud, the same admission must be made in the
  case of the medium Monck, who played a considerable part for some years in
  the 'seventies. Of all mediums none is more difficult to appraise, for on the
  one hand many of his results are beyond all dispute, while in a few there
  seems to be an absolute certainty of dishonesty. In his case, as in Slade's,
  there were physical causes which would account for a degeneration of the
  moral and psychic powers.</p>

    <p class="caption">Francis Ward Monck.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>Monck was a Nonconformist clergyman, a favourite pupil of the famous
  Spurgeon. According to his own account, he had been subject from childhood to
  psychic influences, which increased with his growth. In 1873 he announced his
  adhesion to Spiritualism and gave an address in the Cavendish Rooms. Shortly
  afterwards he began to give demonstrations, which appear to have been unpaid
  and were given in light. In 1875 he made a tour through England and Scotland,
  his performances exciting much attention and debate, and in 1876 he visited
  Ireland, where his powers were directed towards healing. Hence he was usually
  known as "Dr." Monck, a fact which naturally aroused some protest from the
  medical profession.</p>

  <p>Dr. Alfred Russel Wallace, a most competent and honest observer, has given
  an account of a materialization séance with Monck which appears to be as
  critic-proof as such a thing could be. No subsequent suspicion or conviction
  can ever eliminate such an incontrovertible instance of psychic power. It is
  to be noted how far the effects were in agreement with the subsequent
  demonstrations of ectoplasmic outflow in the case of Eva and other modern
  mediums. Dr. Wallace's companions upon this occasion were Mr. Stainton Moses
  and Mr. Hensleigh Wedgwood. Dr. Wallace writes:</p>

  <p><a id="pic14"

    <p class="caption">Alfred Russel Wallace.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p class="quote">It was a bright summer afternoon, and everything happened
in the full
  light of day. After a little conversation, Monck, who was dressed in the
  usual clerical black, appeared to go into a trance; then stood up a few feet
  in front of us, and after a little while pointed to his side, saying,
  "Look."</p>

  <p class="quote">We saw there a faint white patch on his coat on the left
side. This grew
  brighter, then seemed to flicker and extend both upwards and downwards, till
  very gradually it formed a cloudy pillar extending from his shoulder to his
  feet and close to his body.</p>

  <p>Dr. Wallace goes on to describe how the cloudy figure finally assumed the
  form of a thickly draped woman, who, after a brief space, appeared to be
  absorbed into the body of the medium.</p>

  <p>He adds: "The whole process of the formation of a shrouded figure was seen
  in full daylight."</p>

  <p>Mr. Wedgwood assured him that he had lead even more remarkable
  manifestations of this kind with Monck, when the medium was in a deep trance,
  and in full view.</p>

  <p>It is quite impossible after such evidence to doubt the powers of the
  medium at that time. Archdeacon Colley, who had seen similar exhibitions,
  offered a prize of a thousand pounds to Mr. J. N. Maskelyne, the famous
  conjurer, if he could duplicate the performance. This challenge was accepted
  by Mr. Maskelyne, but the evidence showed that the imitation bore no relation
  to the original. He attempted to gain a decision in the courts, but the
  verdict was against him.</p>

  <p>It is interesting to compare the account given by Russel Wallace and the
  experience later of a well-known American, Judge Dailey. This gentleman
  wrote*:</p>

  <p class="quote">Glancing at Dr. Monck's side we observed what looked like
an opalescent
  mass of compact steam emerging from just below his heart on the left side. It
  increased in volume, rising up and extending downward, the upper portions
  taking the form of a child's head, the face being distinguished as that of a
  little child I had lost some twenty years previously. It only remained in
  this form for a moment, and then suddenly disappeared, seeming to be
  instantly absorbed into the Doctor's side. This remarkable phenomenon was
  repeated four or five times, in each instance the materialization being more
  distinct than the preceding one. This was witnessed by all in the room, with
  gas burning sufficiently bright for every object in the room to be plainly
  visible.</p>

  <p class="quote">It was a phenomenon seldom to be seen, and has enabled all
who saw it to
  vouch for, not only the remarkable power possessed by Dr. Monck as a
  materializing medium, but as to the wonderful manner in which a spirit draws
  out.</p>

  <p class="footnote">* <i>Banner Of Light</i>, Dec. 15, 1881.</p>

  <p>Surely it is vain after such testimony to deny that Monck had, indeed,
  great psychic powers.</p>

  <p>Apart from materializations Dr. Monck was a remarkable slate-writing
  medium. Dr. Russel Wallace in a letter to <i>The Spectator</i>* says that
  with Monck at a private house in Richmond he cleaned two slates, and after
  placing a fragment of pencil between them, tied them together tightly with a
  strong cord, lengthways and crosswise, in a manner that prevented any
  movement.</p>

  <p class="quote">I then laid them flat on the table without losing sight of
them for an
  instant. Dr. Monck placed the fingers of both hands on them, while I and a
  lady sitting opposite placed our hands on the corners of the slates. From
  this position our hands were never moved till I untied the slates to
  ascertain the result.</p>

  <p class="footnote">* October 7, 1877.</p>

  <p>Monck asked Wallace to name a word to be written on the slate. He chose
  the word "God" and in answer to a request decided that it should be length
  ways on the slate. The sound of writing was heard, and when the medium's
  hands were withdrawn, Dr. Wallace opened the slates and found on the lower
  one the word he had asked for and written in the manner requested.</p>

  <p>Dr. Wallace says:</p>

  <p class="quote">The essential features of this experiment are that I myself
cleaned and
  tied up the slates; that I kept my hands on them all the time; that they
  never went out of my sight for a moment; and that I named the word to be
  written, and the manner of writing it after they were thus secured and held
  by me.</p>

  <p>Mr. Edward T. Bennett, assistant secretary to the Society for Psychical
  Research, adds to this account: "I was present on this occasion, and certify
  that Mr. Wallace's account of what happened is correct."</p>

  <p>Another good test is described by Mr. W. P. Adshead, of Belper, a
  well-known investigator, who says of a séance held in Derby on September 18,
  1876:</p>

  <p class="quote">There were eight persons present, three ladies and five
gentlemen. A lady
  whom Dr. Monck had never before seen had a slate passed to her by a sitter,
  which she examined and found clean. The slate pencil which was on the table a
  few minutes before we sat down could not be found. An investigator suggested
  that it would be a good test if a lead pencil were used.</p>

  <p class="quote">Accordingly a lead pencil was put on the slate, and the
lady held both
  under the table. The sound of writing was instantly heard, and in a few
  seconds a communication had been written filling one side of the slate. The
  writing was done in lead, and was very small and neat, and alluded to a
  strictly private matter.</p>

  <p class="quote">Here were three tests at once. (1) Writing was obtained
without the medium
  (or any other person but the lady), touching the slate from first to last.
  (2) It was written with lead pencil at the spontaneous suggestion of another
  stranger. (3) It gave an important test communication regarding a matter that
  was strictly private. Dr. Monck did not so much as touch the slate from first
  to last.</p>

  <p>Mr. Adshead also speaks of physical phenomena occurring freely with this
  medium when his hands were closely confined in an apparatus called the
  "stocks," which did not permit movement of even an inch in any direction.</p>

  <p>In the year 1876 the Slade trial was going on in London, as already
  described, and exposures were in the air. In considering the following rather
  puzzling and certainly suspicious case, one has to remember that when a man
  who is a public performer, a conjurer or a mesmerist, can pose as having
  exposed a medium, he wins a valuable public advertisement and attracts to
  himself all that very numerous section of the community who desire to see
  such an exposure. It is only fair to bear this in mind in endeavouring to
  hold the scales fair where there is a conflict of evidence.</p>

  <p>In this case the conjurer and mesmerist was one Lodge, and the occasion
  was a séance held at Huddersfield on November 3, 1876. Mr. Lodge suddenly
  demanded that the medium be searched. Monck, whether dreading assault or to
  save himself exposure, ran upstairs and locked himself in his room. He then
  let himself down from his window and made for the police office, where he
  lodged a complaint as to his treatment. The door of his bedroom had been
  forced and his effects searched, with the result that a pair of stuffed
  gloves was found. Monck asserted that these gloves had been made for a
  lecture in which he had exposed the difference between conjuring and
  mediumship. Still, as a Spiritualist paper remarked at the time:</p>

  <p class="quote">The phenomena of his mediumship do not rest on his probity
at all. If he
  were the greatest rogue and the most accomplished conjurer rolled into one,
  it would not account for the manifestations which have been reported of
  him.</p>

  <p>Monck was sentenced to three months' imprisonment, and is alleged to have
  made a confession to Mr. Lodge.</p>

  <p>After his release from prison Monck held a number of test sittings with
  Stainton Moses, at which remarkable phenomena occurred.</p>

  <p><i>Light</i> comments:</p>

  <p class="quote">Those whose names we have mentioned as testifying to the
genuineness of
  Dr. Monck's mediumship are well-known to the older Spiritualists as keen and
  scrupulously cautious experimenters, and Mr. Hensleigh Wedgwood's name
  carried much weight, as he was known as a man of science and was
  brother-in-law of Charles Darwin.</p>

  <p>There is an element of doubt about the Huddersfield case, as the accuser
  was by no means an impartial person, but Sir William Barrett's testimony
  makes it clear that Monck did sometimes descend to deliberate and
  cold-blooded trickery. Sir William writes:</p>

  <p class="quote">I caught the "Dr." in a gross bit of fraud, a piece of white
  muslin on a wire frame with a black thread attached, being used by the medium
  to simulate a partially materialized spirit.*</p>

  <p class="footnote">* <i>S.P.R. Proceedings</i>, Vol. IV., p. 38
  (footnote).</p>

  <p>Such an exposure, coming from so sure a source, arouses a feeling of
  disgust which urges one to throw the whole evidence concerning the man into
  the wastepaper basket. One must, however, be patient and reasonable in such
  matters. Monck's earlier séances, as has been clearly shown, were in good
  light, and any such clumsy mechanism was out of the question. We must not
  argue that because a man once forges, therefore he has never signed an honest
  cheque in his life. But we must clearly admit that Monck was capable of
  fraud, that he would take the easier way when things were difficult, and that
  each of his manifestations should be carefully checked.</p>

  <h2><a name="chap14"
     id="chap14">XIV. &mdash; COLLECTIVE INVESTIGATIONS OF
     SPIRITUALISM</a></h2>

  <p class="first">SEVERAL committees have at different times sat upon the
  subject of Spiritualism. Of these the two most important are that of the
  Dialectical Society in 1869-70, and the Seybert Commission in 1884, the first
  British and the second American. To these may be added that of the French
  society, Institut General Psychologique in 1905-8. In spite of the intervals
  between these various investigations, it will be convenient to treat them in
  a single chapter as certain remarks in common apply to each of them.</p>

  <p>There are obvious difficulties in the way of collective investigations
  &mdash;difficulties which are so grave that they are almost insurmountable.
  When a Crookes or a Lombroso explores the subject he either sits alone with
  the medium, or he has with him others whose knowledge of psychic conditions
  and laws may be helpful in the matter. This is not usually so with these
  committees. They fail to understand that they are themselves part of the
  experiment, and that it is possible for them to create such intolerable
  vibrations, and to surround themselves with so negative an atmosphere, that
  these outside forces, which are governed by very definite laws, are unable to
  penetrate it. It is not in vain that the three words "with one accord" are
  interpolated into the account of the apostolic sitting in the upper room. If
  a small piece of metal may upset a whole magnetic installation, so a strong
  adverse psychic current may ruin a psychic circle. It is for this reason, and
  not on account of any superior credulity, that practising Spiritualists
  continually get such results as are never attained by mere researchers. This
  also may be the reason why the one committee upon which Spiritualists were
  fairly well represented was the one which gained the most positive results.
  This was the committee which was chosen by the Dialectical Society of London,
  a committee which began its explorations early in 1869 and presented its
  report in 1871. If common sense and the ordinary laws of evidence had been
  followed in the reception of this report, the progress of psychic truth would
  have been accelerated by fifty years.</p>

  <p>Thirty-four gentlemen of standing were appointed upon this committee, the
  terms of reference being "to investigate the phenomena alleged to be
  spiritual manifestations." The majority of the members were certainly in the
  mood to unmask an imposture, but they encountered a body of evidence which
  could not be disregarded, and they ended by asserting that "the subject is
  worthy of more serious attention and careful investigation than it has
  hitherto received." This conclusion so amazed the society which they
  represented that they could not get it to publish the findings, so the
  committee in a spirited way published them at their own cost, thus giving
  permanent record to a most interesting investigation.</p>

  <p>The members of the committee were drawn from many varied professions and
  included a doctor of divinity, two physicians, two surgeons, two civil
  engineers, two fellows of scientific societies, two barristers, and others of
  repute. Charles Bradlaugh the Rationalist was a member. Professor Huxley and
  G. H. Lewes, the consort of George Eliot, were invited to co-operate, but
  both refused, Huxley stating in his reply that "supposing the phenomena to be
  genuine, they do not interest me"&mdash;a dictum which showed that this great
  and clear-headed man had his limitations.</p>

  <p>The six sub-committees sat forty tunes under test conditions, often
  without the aid of a professional medium, and with a full sense of
  responsibility they agreed that the following points appeared to have been
  established</p>

  <p class="quote">"1. That sounds of a very varied character, apparently
proceeding from
  articles of furniture, the floor and walls of the room&mdash;the vibrations
  accompanying which sounds are often distinctly perceptible to the touch
  &mdash;occur, without being produced by muscular action or mechanical
  contrivance.</p>

  <p class="quote">"2. That movements of heavy bodies take place without
mechanical
  contrivance of any kind or adequate exertion of muscular force by the persons
  present, and frequently without contact or connexion with any person.</p>

  <p class="quote">"3. That these sounds and movements often occur at the
times and in the
  manner asked for by persons present, and, by means of a simple code of
  signals, answer questions and spell out coherent communications.</p>

  <p class="quote">"4. That the answers and communications thus obtained are,
for the most
  part, of a commonplace character; but facts are sometimes correctly given
  which are only known to one of the persons present.</p>

  <p class="quote">"5. That the circumstances under which the phenomena occur
are variable,
  the most prominent fact being that the presence of certain persons seems
  necessary to their occurrence, and that of others generally adverse; but this
  difference does not appear to depend upon any belief or disbelief concerning
  the phenomena.</p>

  <p class="quote">"6. That, nevertheless, the occurrence of the phenomena is
not ensured by
  the presence or absence of such persons respectively."</p>

  <p>The report briefly summarizes as follows the oral and written evidence
  received, which not only testifies to phenomena of the same nature as those
  witnessed by the sub-committees, but to others of a more varied and
  extraordinary character:</p>

  <p class="quote">"1. Thirteen witnesses state that they have seen heavy
bodies&mdash;in
  some instances men&mdash;rise slowly in the air and remain there for some
  time without visible or tangible support.</p>

  <p class="quote">"2. Fourteen witnesses testify to having seen hands or
figures, not
  appertaining to any human being, but lifelike in appearance and mobility,
  which they have sometimes touched or even grasped, and which they are
  therefore convinced were not the result of imposture or illusion.</p>

  <p class="quote">"3. Five witnesses state that they have been touched by
some invisible
  agency on various parts of the body, and often where requested, when the
  hands of all present were visible.</p>

  <p class="quote">"4. Thirteen witnesses declare that they have heard musical
pieces well
  played upon instruments not manipulated by any ascertainable agency.</p>

  <p class="quote">"5. Five witnesses state that they have seen red-hot coals
applied to the
  hands or heads of several persons without producing pain or scorching, and
  three witnesses state that they have had the same experiment made upon
  themselves with the like immunity.</p>

  <p class="quote">"6. Eight witnesses state that they have received precise
information
  through rappings, writings, and in other ways, the accuracy of which was
  unknown at the time to themselves or to any persons present, and which on
  subsequent inquiry was found to be correct.</p>

  <p class="quote">"7. One witness declares that he has received a precise and
detailed
  statement which, nevertheless, proved to be entirely erroneous.</p>

  <p class="quote">"8. Three witnesses state that they have been present when
drawings, both
  in pencil and colours, were produced in so short a time, and under such
  conditions as to render human agency impossible.</p>

  <p class="quote">"9. Six witnesses declare that they have received
information of future
  events, and that in some cases the hour and minute of their occurrence have
  been accurately foretold, days and even weeks before."</p>

  <p>In addition to the above, evidence was given of trance-speaking, of
  healing, of automatic writing, of the introduction of flowers and fruits into
  closed rooms, of voices in the air, of visions in crystals and glasses, and
  of the elongation of the human body.</p>

  <p>The report closes with the following observations:</p>

  <p class="quote">In presenting their report, your Committee, taking into
consideration the
  high character and great intelligence of many of the witnesses to the more
  extraordinary facts, the extent to which their testimony is supported by the
  reports of the sub-committees, and the absence of any proof of imposture or
  delusion as regards a large portion of the phenomena; and further, having
  regard to the exceptional character of the phenomena, the large number of
  persons in every grade of society and over the whole civilized world who are
  more or less influenced by a belief in their supernatural origin, and to the
  fact that no philosophical explanation of them has yet been arrived at, deem
  it incumbent upon them to state their conviction that the subject is worthy
  of more serious attention and careful investigation than it has hitherto
  received.</p>

  <p>Among those who gave evidence or read papers before the committee were:
  Dr. Alfred Russel Wallace, Mrs. Emma Hardinge, Mr. H. D. Jencken, Mr.
  Benjamin Coleman, Mr. Cromwell F. Varley, Mr. D.D. Home, and the Master of
  Lindsay. Correspondence was received from Lord Lytton, Mr. Robert Chambers,
  Dr. Garth Wilkinson, Mr. William Howitt, M. Camille Flammarion, and
  others.</p>

  <p>The committee was successful in procuring the evidence of believers in the
  phenomena, but almost wholly failed, as stated in its report, to obtain
  evidence from those who attributed them to fraud or delusion.</p>

  <p>In the records of the evidence of over fifty witnesses, there is
  voluminous testimony to the existence of the facts from men and women of good
  standing. One witness* considered that the most remarkable phenomenon brought
  to light by the labours of the committee was the extraordinary number of
  eminent men who were shown to be firm believers in the Spiritual hypothesis.
  And another declared that whatever agencies might be employed in these
  manifestations, they were not to be explained by referring them to imposture
  on the one side or hallucination on the other.</p>

  <p class="footnote">* Grattan Geary. E. L. Blanchard.</p>

  <p>An interesting sidelight on the growth of the movement is obtained from
  Mrs. Emma Hardinge's statement that at that time (1869) she knew only two
  professional mediums in London, though she was acquainted with several
  non-professional ones. As she herself was a medium she was probably correct
  in what she said. Mr. Cromwell Varley averred that there were probably not
  more than a hundred known mediums in the whole kingdom, and he added that
  very few of those were well developed. We have here conclusive testimony to
  the great work accomplished in England by D.D. Home, for the bulk of the
  converts were due to his mediumship. Another medium who played an important
  part was Mrs. Marshall. Many witnesses spoke of evidential sittings they had
  attended at her house. Mr. William Howitt, the well-known author, was of
  opinion that Spiritualism had then received the assent of about twenty
  millions of people in all countries after personal examination.</p>

  <p>What may be called the evidence for the opposition was not at all
  formidable. Lord Lytton said that in his experience the phenomena were
  traceable to material influences of whose nature we were ignorant, Dr.
  Carpenter brought out his pet hobby of "unconscious cerebration." Dr. Kidd
  thought that the majority were evidently subjective phenomena, and three
  witnesses, while convinced of the genuineness of the occurrences, ascribed
  them to Satanic agency. These objections were well answered by Mr. Thomas
  Shorter, author of "Confessions of a Truth Seeker," and secretary of the
  Working Men's College, in an admirable review of the report in the
  <i>Spiritual Magazine</i>.*</p>

  <p class="footnote">* 1872, pp. 3-15.</p>

  <p>It is worthy of note that on the publication of this important and
  well-considered report it was ridiculed by a large part of the London Press.
  An honourable exception was <i>The Spectator</i>.</p>

  <p><i>The Times</i> reviewer considered it "nothing more than a farrago of
  impotent conclusions, garnished by a mass of the most monstrous rubbish it
  has ever been our misfortune to sit in judgment upon."</p>

  <p><i>The Morning Post</i> said: "The report which has been published is
  entirely worthless."</p>

  <p><i>The Saturday Review</i> hoped that report would involuntarily lead "to
  discrediting a little further one of the most unequivocally degrading
  superstitions that have ever found currency among reasonable beings."</p>

  <p><i>The Standard</i> made a sound criticism that deserves to be remembered.
  Objecting to the remark of those who do not believe in Spiritualism, yet say
  that there may be "something in it," the newspaper sagely observes: "If there
  is anything whatever in it beyond imposture and imbecility, there is the
  whole of another world in it."</p>

  <p><i>The Daily News</i> regarded the report as "an important contribution to
  the literature of a subject which, some day or other, by the very number of
  its followers, will demand more extended investigation."</p>

  <p><i>The Spectator</i>, after describing the book as an extremely curious
  one, added: "Few, however, could read the mass of evidence collected in this
  volume, showing the firm faith in the reality of the alleged spiritual
  phenomena possessed by a number of individuals of honourable and upright
  character, without also agreeing with Mr. Jeffrey's opinion, that the
  remarkable phenomena witnessed, some of which had not been traced to
  imposture or delusion, and the gathered testimony of respectable witnesses,
  'justify the recommendation of the subject to further cautious
  investigation.'"</p>

  <p>These are but brief extracts from longer notices in a few of the London
  newspapers&mdash;there were many others&mdash;and, bad as they are, they none
  the less indicate a change of attitude on the part of the Press, which had
  been in the habit of ignoring the subject altogether.</p>

  <p>It must be remembered that the report concerned itself only with the
  phenomenal aspect of Spiritualism, and this, in the opinion of leading
  Spiritualists, is decidedly the less important side. Only in the report of
  one sub-committee is it recorded that the general gist of the messages was
  that physical death was a trivial matter in retrospect, but that for the
  spirit it was a rebirth into new experiences of existence, that spirit life
  was in every respect human; that friendly intercourse was as common and
  pleasurable as in life; that although spirits took great interest in worldly
  affairs, they had no wish to return to their former state of existence; that
  communication with earth friends was pleasurable and desired by spirits,
  being intended as a proof to the former of the continuance of life in spite
  of bodily dissolution, and that spirits claimed no certain prophetic power.
  These were the main heads of the information received.</p>

  <p>It will be generally recognized in the future that in their day and
  generation, the Dialectical Society's Committee did excellent work. The great
  majority of the members were opposed to the psychic claims, but in the face
  of evidence, with a few exceptions, such as Dr. Edmunds, they yielded to the
  testimony of their own senses. There were a few examples of intolerance such
  as Huxley's unhappy dictum, and Charles Bradlaugh's declaration that he would
  not even examine certain things because they were in the region of the
  impossible, but on the whole the team work of the sub-committees was
  excellent.</p>

  <p>There appears in the report of the Dialectical Society's Committee a long
  article by Dr. Edmunds, an opponent to Spiritualism, and to the findings of
  his colleagues. It is worth reading as typical of a certain class of mind.
  The worthy doctor, while imagining himself to be impartial, is really so
  absolutely prejudiced that the conceivable possibility of the phenomena being
  supernormal never is allowed to enter into his mind. When he sees one with
  his own eyes his only question is, "How was the trick done?" If he cannot
  answer the question he does not consider this to be in favour of some other
  explanation, but simply records that he cannot discover the trick. Thus his
  evidence, which is perfectly honest as to fact, records that a number of
  fresh flowers and fruits, still wet, fell upon the table&mdash;a phenomenon
  of apports which was shown many times by Mrs. Guppy. The doctor's only
  comment is that they must have been taken from the sideboard, although one
  would have imagined that a large basket of fruit upon the sideboard would
  have attracted attention, and he does not venture to say that he saw such an
  object. Again he was shut up with the Davenports in their cabinet and admits
  that he could make nothing of it, but, of course, it must be a conjuring
  trick. Then when he finds that mediums who perceive that his mental attitude
  is hopeless refuse to sit with him again, he sets that down also as an
  evidence of their guilt. There is a certain type of scientific mind which is
  quite astute within its own subject and, outside it, is the most foolish and
  illogical thing upon earth.</p>

  <p>It was the misfortune of the Seybert Commission, which we will now
  discuss, that it was entirely composed of such people, with the exception of
  one Spiritualist, a Mr. Hazard, who was co-opted by them and who had little
  chance of influencing their general atmosphere of obstruction. The
  circumstances in which the Commission was appointed were these. A certain
  Henry Seybert, a citizen of Philadelphia, had left the sum of sixty thousand
  dollars for the purpose of founding a Chair of Philosophy at the University
  of Pennsylvania with the condition that the said University should appoint a
  commission to "make a thorough and impartial investigation of all systems of
  morals, religion, or philosophy which assume to represent the truth, and
  particularly of modern Spiritualism." The personnel of the body chosen is
  immaterial save that all were connected with the University, with Dr. Pepper,
  the Provost of the University as nominal chairman, Dr. Furness as acting
  chairman, and Professor Fullerton as secretary. In spite of the fact that the
  duty of the Commission was to "make a thorough and impartial investigation"
  of modern Spiritualism, the preliminary report coolly states The Commission
  is composed of men whose days are already filled with duties which cannot be
  laid aside, and who are able, therefore, to devote but a small portion of
  their time to these investigations.</p>

  <p>The fact that the members were satisfied to start with this handicap shows
  how little they understood the nature of the work before them. Their failure,
  in the circumstances, was inevitable. The proceedings began in March, 1884,
  and a "preliminary" report, so called, was issued in 1887. This report was,
  as it proved, the final one, for though it was reissued in 1920 there was no
  addition save a colourless preface of three paragraphs by a descendant of the
  former chairman. The gist of this report is that fraud on the one side and
  credulity on the other make up the whole of Spiritualism, and that there was
  really nothing serious on which the committee could report. The whole long
  document is well worth reading by any student of psychic matters. The
  impression left upon the mind is that the various members of the Commission
  were in their own limited way honestly endeavouring to get at the facts, but
  that their minds, like that of Dr. Edmunds, were so formed that when, in
  spite of their repellent and impossible attitude, some psychic happening did
  manage to break through their barriers, they would not for an instant
  consider the possibility that it was genuine, but simply passed it by as if
  it did not exist. Thus with Mrs. Fox-Kane they did get well-marked raps, and
  are content with the thousand-times disproved supposition that they came from
  inside her own body, and they pass without comment the fact that they
  received from her long messages, written swiftly in script, which could only
  be read when held to the looking-glass, as it was from right to left. This
  swiftly-written script contained an abstruse Latin sentence which would
  appear to be much above the capacity of the medium. All of this was
  unexplained and ignored.</p>

  <p>Again, in reporting upon Mrs. Lord the Commission got the Direct Voice,
  and also phosphorescent lights after the medium had been searched. We are
  informed that the medium kept up an "almost continuous clapping of hands,"
  and yet people at a distance from her seem to have been touched. The spirit
  in which the inquiry is approached may be judged from the remark of the
  acting chairman to W. M. Keeler, who was said to be a spirit photographer,
  that he "would not be satisfied with less than a cherub on my head, one on
  each shoulder, and a full-blown angel on my breast." A Spiritualist would be
  surprised indeed if an inquirer in so frivolous a mood should be favoured
  with results. All through runs the fallacy that the medium is producing
  something as a conjurer does. Never for a moment do they seem to realize that
  the favour and assent of invisible operators may be essential &mdash;
  operators who may stoop to the humble-minded and shrink away from, or even
  make game of, the self-sufficient scoffer.</p>

  <p>While there were some results which may have been genuine, but which are
  brushed aside by the report, there were some episodes which must be painful
  to the Spiritualist, but which none the less must be faced. The Commission
  exposed obvious fraud in the case of the slate medium, Mrs. Patterson, and it
  is impossible to deny that the case against Slade is a substantial one. The
  latter days of this medium were admittedly under a cloud, and the powers
  which had once been so conspicuous may have been replaced by trickery. Dr.
  Furness goes the length of asserting that such trickery was actually
  admitted, but the anecdote as given in the report rather suggests chaff upon
  the part of the medium. That Dr. Slade should jovially beckon the doctor in
  from his open window, and should at once in reply to a facetious remark admit
  that his own whole life had been a swindle, is more than one can easily
  believe.</p>

  <p>There are some aspects in which the Commission&mdash;or some members of
  it&mdash;seem to have been disingenuous. Thus, they state at the beginning
  that they will rest their report upon their own labours and disregard the
  mass of material already available. In spite of this, they introduce a long
  and adverse report from their secretary upon the Zollner evidence in favour
  of Slade. This report is quite incorrect in itself, as is shown in the
  account of Zollner given in the chapter treating of Slade's experiences in
  Leipzig. It carefully suppresses the fact that the chief conjurer in Germany,
  after a considerable investigation, gave a certificate that Slade's phenomena
  were not trickery. On the other hand, when the testimony of a conjurer is
  against a spiritual explanation, as in the comments of Kellar, it is given in
  full, with no knowledge, apparently, that in the case of another medium,
  Eglinton, this same Kellar had declared the results to be beyond his art.</p>

  <p>At the opening of the report the Commission says: "We deemed ourselves
  fortunate at the outset in having as a counsellor the late Mr. Thomas R.
  Hazard, a personal friend of Mr. Seybert, and widely known throughout the
  land as an uncompromising Spiritualist." Mr. Hazard evidently knew the
  importance of ensuring the right conditions and the right type of sitters for
  such an experimental investigation. Describing an interview he had with Mr.
  Seybert a few days before the latter's death, when he agreed to act as his
  representative, Mr. Hazard says he did so only "with the full and distinct
  understanding that I should be permitted to prescribe the methods to be
  pursued in the investigation, designate the mediums to be consulted, and
  reject the attendance of any person or persons whose presence I deemed might
  conflict with the harmony and good order of the spirit circles." But this
  representative of Mr. Seybert seems to have been quietly ignored by the
  University. After the Commission had been sitting for some time, Mr. Hazard
  was dissatisfied with some of its members and their methods. We find him
  writing as follows in the Philadelphia <i>North American</i>, [May 18, 1885.]
  presumably after vainly approaching the University authorities:</p>

  <p class="quote">Without aiming to detract in the slightest degree from the
unblemished
  moral character that attaches to each and every individual of the Faculty,
  including the Commission, in public esteem, nor to the high social and
  literary standing they occupy in society, I must say that through some
  strange infatuation, obliquity of judgment, or perversity of intellect, the
  Trustees of the University have placed on the Commission for the
  investigation of modern Spiritualism, a majority of its members whose
  education, habit of thought, and prejudices so singularly disqualify them
  from making a thorough and impartial investigation of the subject which the
  Trustees of the University are obligated both by contract and in honour to
  do, that had the object in view been to belittle and bring into discredit,
  hatred and general contempt the cause that I know the late Henry Seybert held
  nearest his heart and loved more than all else in the world beside, the
  Trustees could scarcely have selected more suitable instruments for the
  object intended from all the denizens of Philadelphia than are the gentlemen
  who constitute a majority of the Seybert Commission. And this I repeat, not
  from any causes that affect their moral, social or literary standing in
  society, but simply because of their prejudices against the cause of
  Spiritualism.</p>

  <p>He further advised the Trustees to remove from the Commission Messrs.
  Fullerton, Thompson, and Koenig.</p>

  <p>Mr. Hazard quoted Professor Fullerton as saying in a lecture before the
  Harvard University Club on March 3, 1885:</p>

  <p class="quote">
  It is possible that the way mediums tell a person's history is by the
  process of thought-transference, for every person who is thus told of these
  things goes to a medium thinking of the same points about which the medium
  talks... When a man has a cold he hears a buzzing noise in his ears, and an
insane
  person constantly hears sounds which never occur. Perhaps, then, disease of
  mind or ear, or some strong emotion, may be the cause of a large number of
  spiritual phenomena.</p>

  <p>These words were spoken after the professor had served on the Commission
  for more than twelve months.</p>

  <p>Mr. Hazard also quotes Dr. George A. Koenig's views, published in <i>The
  Philadelphia Press</i>, about a year after his appointment on the
  Commission:</p>

  <p class="quote">I must frankly admit that I am prepared to deny the truth
of Spiritualism
  as it is now popularly understood. It is my belief that all of the so-called
  mediums are humbugs without exception. I have never seen Slade perform any of
  his tricks, but, from the published descriptions, I have set him down as an
  impostor, the cleverest one of the lot. I do not think the Commission view
  with much favour the examination of so-called spirit mediums. The wisest men
  are apt to be deceived. One man in an hour can invent more tricks than a wise
  man can solve in a year.</p>

  <p>Mr. Hazard learned from what he considered to be a reliable source, that
  Professor Robert E. Thompson was responsible for this view which appeared in
  Penn's Monthly of February, 1880.</p>

  <p class="quote">Even if Spiritualism be all that its champions claim for
it, it has no
  importance for anyone who holds a Christian faith. The consideration and
  discussion of the subject is tampering with notions and condescending to
  discussions with which no Christian believer has any business.</p>

  <p>We have in these expressions of opinion a means of judging how unsuited
  these members of the Commission were for making what Mr. Seybert asked for
  &mdash;"a thorough and impartial" investigation of the subject.</p>

  <p>An American Spiritualist periodical, the <i>Banner Of Light</i>,
  commenting on Mr. Hazard's communication, wrote:</p>

  <p class="quote">So far as we have information, no notice was taken of Mr.
Hazard's appeal
  &mdash;certainly no action was had, for the members above quoted remain on
  the Commission to this day, and their names are appended to this preliminary
  report. Professor Fullerton, in fact, was and now is the secretary; one
  hundred and twenty of the one hundred and fifty pages of the volume before us
  are written by him, and exhibit that excessive lack of spiritual perception
  and knowledge of occult, and we might also say natural laws, which led him to
  inform an audience of Harvard students that "when a man has a cold he hears a
  buzzing noise in his ears"; that "an insane person constantly hears sounds
  which never occur," and suggest to them that spiritual phenomena may proceed
  from such causes.</p>

  <p>The <i>Banner Of Light</i> continues:</p>

  <p class="quote">We consider that the Seybert Commission's failure to follow
the counsel of
  Mr. Hazard, as it was plainly their duty to do, is the key to the entire
  failure of all their sub sequent efforts. The paucity of phenomenal results,
  in any degree approaching what might be looked for, even by a sceptic, which
  this book records, is certainly remarkable. It is a report of what was not
  done, rather than that of what was. In the memoranda of proceedings at each
  session, as given by Professor Fullerton, there is plainly seen a studied
  effort to give prominence to everything that a superficial mind might deem
  proof of trickery on the part of the medium, and to conceal all that might be
  evidence of the truth of his claims... It is mentioned that when certain
  members of the Commission were present all phenomena ceased. This
  substantiates the correctness of Mr. Hazard's position; and there is no one
  who has had an experience with mediums, sufficient to render his opinion of
  any value, who will not endorse it. The spirits knew what elements they had
  to deal with; they endeavoured to eliminate those that rendered their
  experiments nugatory; they failed to do this through the ignorance,
  wilfulness or prejudice of the Commission, and the experiments failed; so the
  Commission, very "wise in its own conceit," decided that all was fraud.</p>

  <p><i>Light</i>,* in its notice of the report, says what needs saying as much
  now as in 1887:</p>

  <p class="quote">We notice with some pleasure, though without any marked
expectation of
  what may result from the pursuance of bad methods of investigation, that the
  Commission pro poses to continue its quest "with minds as sincerely and
  honestly open as heretofore to conviction." Since this is so, we presume to
  offer a few words of advice founded upon large experience. The investigation
  of these obscure phenomena is beset with difficulty, and any instructions
  that can be given are derived from a knowledge which is to a great extent
  empirical. But we know that prolonged and patient experiment with a properly
  constituted circle is a <i>sine qua non</i>. We know that all does not depend
  on the medium, but that a circle must be formed and varied from time to time
  experimentally, until the proper constituent elements are secured. What these
  elements may be we cannot tell the Seybert Commission. They must discover
  that for themselves. Let them make a study in the literature of Spiritualism
  of the varied characteristics of mediumship before they proceed to personal
  experiment. And when they have done this, and perhaps when they have realized
  how easy it is so to conduct an examination of this nature as to arrive at
  negative results, they will be in a better position to devote intelligent and
  patient care to a study which can be profitably conducted in no other
  way.</p>

  <p class="footnote">*1887, p. 391.</p>

  <p>There is no doubt that the report of the Seybert Commission set back for
  the time the cause of psychic truth. Yet the real harm fell upon the learned
  institution which these gentlemen represented. In these days when ectoplasm,
  the physical basis of psychic phenomena, has been established beyond a shadow
  of doubt to all who examine the evidence, it is too late to pretend that
  there is nothing to be examined. There is now hardly a capital which has not
  its Psychic Research Society&mdash;a final comment upon the inference of the
  Commission that there was no field for research. If the Seybert Commission
  had had the effect of Pennsylvania University heading this movement, and
  living up to the great tradition of Professor Hare, how proud would her final
  position have been! As Newton associated Cambridge with the law of
  gravitation, so Pennsylvania might have been linked to a far more important
  advance of human knowledge. It was left to several European centres of
  learning to share the honour among them.</p>

  <p>The remaining collective investigation is of less importance, since it
  deals only with a particular medium. This was conducted by the Institut
  General Psychologique in Paris. It consisted of three series of sittings with
  the famous Eusapia Palladino in the years 1905, 1906, and 1907, the total
  number of séances being forty-three. No complete list of the sitters is
  available, nor was there any proper collective report, the only record being
  a very imperfect and inconclusive one from the secretary, M. Courtier. The
  investigators included some very distinguished persons, including Charles
  Richet, Monsieur and Madame Curie, Messrs. Bergson, Perrin, Professor
  d'Arsonal of the College de France, who was president of the society, Count
  de Gramont, Professor Charpentier, and Principal Debierne of the Sorbonne.
  The actual result could not have been disastrous to the medium, since
  Professor Richet has recorded his endorsement of the reality of her psychic
  powers, but the strange superficial tricks of Eusapia are recorded in the
  subsequent account of her career, and we can well imagine the disconcerting
  effect which they would have upon those to whom such things were new.</p>

  <p>There is included in the report a sort of conversation among the sitters
  in which they talk the matter over, most of them being in a very nebulous and
  non-committal frame of mind. It cannot be claimed that any new light was shed
  upon the medium, or any new argument provided either for the sceptic or for
  the believer. Dr. Geley, however, who has probably gone as deeply as anyone
  else into psychic science, claims that "les experiences"&mdash;he does not
  say the report&mdash;constitute a valuable contribution to the subject.* He
  bases this upon the fact that the results chronicled do often strikingly
  confirm those obtained in his own Institut Métapsychique working with Kluski,
  Guzik, and other mediums. The differences, he says, are in details and never
  in essentials. The control of the hands was the same in either case, both the
  hands being always held. This was easier in the case of the later mediums,
  especially with Kluski in trance, while Eusapia was usually a very restless
  individual. There seems to be a halfway condition which was characteristic of
  Eusapia, and which has been observed by the author in the case of Frau
  Silbert, Evan Powell, and other mediums, where the person seems normal, and
  yet is peculiarly susceptible to suggestion or other mental impressions. A
  suspicion of fraud may very easily be aroused in this condition, for the
  general desire on the part of the audience that something should occur reacts
  with great force upon the unreasoning mind of the medium. An amateur who had
  some psychic power has assured the author that it needs considerable
  inhibition to keep such impulses in check and to await the real power from
  outside. In this report we read: "The two hands, feet, and knees of Eusapia
  being controlled, the table is raised suddenly, all four feet leaving the
  ground. Eusapia closes her fists and holds them towards the table, which is
  then completely raised from the floor five times in succession, five raps
  being also given. It is again completely raised whilst each of Eusapia's
  hands is on the head of a sitter. It is raised to a height of one foot from
  the floor and suspended in the air for seven seconds, while Eusapia kept her
  hand on the table, and a lighted candle was placed under the table," and so
  on, with even more conclusive tests with table and other phenomena.</p>

  <p class="footnote">* <i>L'Ectoplasmie et la Clairvoyance</i>, 1924, p.
  402.</p>

  <p>The timidity of the report was satirized by the great French Spiritualist,
  Gabriel Delanne. He says:</p>

  <p class="quote">The reporter keeps saying "it seems" and "it appears," like
a man who is
  not sure of what he is relating. Those who held forty-three séances, with
  good eyes and apparatus for verification, ought to have a settled opinion
  &mdash;or, at least, to be able to say, if they regard a certain phenomenon
  as fraudulent, that at a given séance they had seen the medium in the act of
  tricking. But there is nothing of the sort. The reader is left in uncertainty
  &mdash;a vague suspicion hovers over everything, though not supported on any
  serious grounds.</p>

  <p>Commenting on this, <i>Light</i> says: *</p>

  <p class="footnote">* 1909, p. 356.</p>

  <p class="quote">Delanne shows by extracts from the Report itself that some
of the
  experiments succeeded even when the fullest test precautions were taken, such
  as using lamp-black to discover whether Eusapia really touched the objects
  moved. Yet the Report deliberately discounts these direct and positive
  observations by instancing cases occurring <i>at other times and places</i>
  in which Eusapia was <i>said</i> or <i>believed</i> to have unduly influenced
  the phenomena.</p>

  <p class="quote">The Courier Report will prove more and more plainly to be
what we have
  already called it, a "monument of ineptitude," and the reality of Eusapia's
  phenomena cannot be seriously called in question by the meaningless phrases
  with which it is liberally garnished.</p>

  <p>What may be called a collective investigation of a medium, Mrs. Crandon,
  the wife of a doctor in Boston, was undertaken in the years 1923 to 1925 by a
  committee chosen by <i>The Scientific American</i> and afterwards by a small
  committee of Harvard men with Dr. Shapley, the astronomer, at their head. The
  controversy over these inquiries is still raging, and the matter has been
  referred to in the chapter which deals with great modern mediums. It may
  briefly be stated that of <i>The Scientific American</i> inquirers the
  secretary, Mr. Malcolm Bird, and Dr. Hereward Carrington announced their
  complete conversion.</p>

  <p>The others gave no clear decision which involved the humiliating admission
  that after numerous sittings under their own conditions and in the presence
  of constant phenomena, they could not tell whether they were being cheated or
  not. The defect of the committee was that no experienced Spiritualist who was
  familiar with psychic conditions was upon it. Dr. Prince was very deaf, while
  Dr. McDougall was in a position where his whole academic career would
  obviously be endangered by the acceptance of an unpopular explanation. The
  same remark applies to Dr. Shapley's committee, which was all composed of
  budding scientists. Without imputing conscious mental dishonesty, there is a
  subconscious drag to wards the course of safety. Reading the report of these
  gentlemen with their signed acquiescence at each sitting with the result, and
  their final verdict of fraud, one cannot discover any normal way in which
  they have reached their conclusions. On the other hand, the endorsements of
  the mediumship by folk who had no personal reasons for extreme caution were
  frequent and enthusiastic. Dr. Mark Richardson of Boston reported that he had
  sat more than 300 times, and had no doubt at all about the results.</p>

  <p>The author has seen numerous photographs of the ectoplasmic flow from
  "Margery," and has no hesitation, on comparing it with similar photographs
  taken in Europe, in saying that it is unquestionably genuine, and that the
  future will justify the medium as against her unreasonable critics.</p>

  <h3>NOTES TO CHAPTER IV</h3>

  <h3>EVIDENCE OF THE HAUNTING OF THE HYDESVILLE<br>
  HOUSE BEFORE THE FOX FAMILY OCCUPIED IT</h3>

  <p class="first">Mrs. Ann Pulver certifies:</p>

  <p>I was acquainted with Mr. and Mrs. Bell (who occupied the house in 1844).
  I used to call on them frequently. My warping bars were in their chamber, and
  I used to go there to do my work. One morning when I went there Mrs. Bell
  told me that she felt very bad; that she had not slept much, if any, the
  night before. When I asked her what the matter was, she said she didn't know
  but what it was the fidgets; but she thought she heard somebody walking about
  from one room to another, and that she had Mr. Bell get up and fasten down
  all the windows. She said she felt more safe after that. I asked her what she
  thought it was. She said it might be rats. I heard her speak about hearing
  noises after that, which she could not account for.</p>

  <p class="first">Miss Lucretia Pulver gave testimony:</p>

  <p>I lived in this house all one winter, in the family of Mr. Bell. I worked
  for them part of the time, and part of the time I boarded and went to school.
  I lived there about three months. During the latter part of the time that I
  was there I heard this knocking frequently in the bedroom, under the foot of
  the bed. I heard it a number of nights, as I slept in the bedroom all the
  time that I staid there. One night I thought I heard a man walking in the
  buttery. This buttery is near the bedroom, with a stairway between. Miss
  Aurelia Losey staid with me on that night; she also heard the noise, and we
  were both much frightened, and got up and fastened down the windows and
  fastened the door. It sounded as if a person walked through the buttery, down
  cellar, and part way across the cellar-bottom, and there the noise would
  cease. There was no one else in the house at this time, except my little
  brother, who was asleep in the same room with us. This was about twelve
  o'clock, I should think. We did not go to bed until after eleven, and had not
  been asleep when we heard the noise. Mr. and Mrs. Bell had gone to Loch
  Berlin, to be gone until the next day.</p>

  <p>Thus it is proved that strange sounds were heard in the house in 1844.
  Another family named Weekman lived there in 1846-7, and they had a similar
  experience.</p><br>

  <h3>STATEMENT OF MRS. HANNAH WEEKMAN</h3>

  <p>I have heard about the mysterious noises that have been heard in the house
  now occupied by Mr. Fox. We used to live in the same house; we lived there
  about a year and a half and moved from there to the house we now occupy.
  About a year ago, while we were living there, we heard someone, as we
  supposed, rapping on the outside door. I had just got into bed, but my
  husband had not. He went and opened it, and said that there was no one there.
  He came back, and was about getting into bed when we heard the rapping on the
  door again. He then went to the door and opened it, and said that he could
  see no one, although he stepped out a little way. He then came back and got
  into bed. He was quite angry; he thought 'twas some of the neighbouring boys
  trying to disturb us, and said that "They might knock away, but they would
  not fool him," or something of that kind. The knocking was heard again, and
  after a while he got up and went to the door and went out. I told him not to
  go outdoors, for perhaps somebody wanted to get him out and hurt him. He came
  back, and said he could see nothing. We heard a good deal of noise during the
  night; we could hardly tell where it was: it sounded sometimes as if someone
  was walking in the cellar. But the house was old, and we thought it might be
  the rattling of loose boards, or something of that kind.</p>

  <p>A few nights afterwards, one of our little girls, who slept in the bedroom
  where the noises are now heard, woke us all up by screaming very loud. My
  husband and I, and our hired girl, got up immediately to see what was the
  matter. She sat up in bed, crying and screaming, and it was some time before
  we could find out what the matter was. She said that something had been
  moving about, over her head and face&mdash;that it was cold, and she did not
  know what it was. She said that she felt it all over her, but she was most
  alarmed at feeling it on her face. She was very much frightened. This was
  between twelve and one o'clock at night. She got up and got into bed with us,
  and it was a long time before she could go to sleep. It was several days
  before we could get her to sleep in that room again. She was eight years old
  at that time.</p>

  <p>Nothing else happened to me during the time that we lived there; but my
  husband told me that one night he heard someone call him by name, somewhere
  in the house&mdash;he did not know where&mdash;but could never find out where
  or what it was that night. I was not at home that night. I was sitting up
  with a sick person. We did not think the house was haunted at that time.</p>

  <p>Hannah Weekman April 11, 1848.</p><br>

  <h3>STATEMENT OF MICHAEL WEEKMAN</h3>

  <p>I am the husband of Hannah Weekman. We used to live in the house now
  occupied by Mr. Fox, in which they say strange noises are heard. We lived
  there about a year and a half. One evening, about bedtime, I heard the
  rapping. I supposed it was someone knocking at the door who wanted to come
  in. I did not bid him "Come in," as I usually do, but went to the door. I did
  not find anyone there, but went back, and just as I was getting into bed I
  heard the rapping again and opened the door quick, but could see no one
  there. I stepped out a step or two, but could see no one about there. I then
  went back and got into bed. I thought someone was making game of me. After a
  few minutes I heard the knocking again, and after waiting a few minutes and
  still hearing it, I got up and went to the door. This time I went clear out
  and looked around the house, but could find no one. I then stepped back and
  shut the door, and held on to the latch, thinking that if there was anyone
  there I would catch them at it. In a minute or two I heard the rapping again.
  My hand was on the door, and the knocking appeared to be on the door. I could
  feel it jar with the raps. I instantly opened the door and sprang out, but
  there was no one in sight. I then went round the house again, but could find
  no one, as before. My wife told me I had better not go out of doors, as it
  might be someone that wanted to hurt me. I did not know what to think of it,
  it seemed so strange and unaccountable.</p>

  <p>He here relates the case of the little girl being frightened, as given
  above.</p>

  <p>One night after this, about midnight, I was awake, and heard my name
  called. It sounded as if it was on the south side of the room.</p>

  <p>I sat up in bed and listened, but did not hear it again. I did not get out
  of bed, but waited to see if it would be repeated. My wife was not at home
  that night. I told her of it afterwards, and she said she guessed I had been
  dreaming. My wife used to be frightened quite often by hearing strange noises
  in and about the house.</p>

  <p>I have heard so much from men in whom I place confidence about these
  noises that are now heard, that, taken in connexion with what I heard, I
  cannot account for it, unless it is a supernatural appearance. I am willing
  to make affidavit to the above facts if necessary.</p>

  <h3>THE MYSTERIOUS RAPPINGS</h3>

  <p>Mrs. Fox and her three daughters left our city yesterday on their return
  to Rochester, after a stay here of some weeks, during which they have
  subjected the mysterious influence, by which they seem to be accompanied, to
  every reasonable test, and to the keen and critical scrutiny of hundreds who
  have chosen to visit them, or whom they have been invited to visit. The rooms
  which they occupied at the hotel have been repeatedly searched and
  scrutinized; they have been taken without an hour's notice into houses they
  had never before entered; they have been all unconsciously placed on a glass
  surface concealed under the carpet in order to interrupt electrical
  vibrations; they have been disrobed by a committee of ladies appointed
  without notice, and insisting that neither of them should leave the room
  until the investigation has been made, etc., etc., yet we believe no one, to
  this moment, pretends that he has detected either of them in producing or
  causing the "rappings," nor do we think any of their contemners has invented
  a plausible theory to account for the production of these sounds, nor the
  singular intelligence which (certainly at times) has seemed to be manifest
  through them.</p>

  <p>Some ten or twelve days since they gave up their rooms at the hotel and
  devoted the remainder of their sojourn here to visiting several families, to
  which they had been invited by persons interested in the subject, and
  subjecting the singular influence to a closer, calmer examination than could
  be given to it at a hotel, and before casual companies of strangers, drawn
  together by vague curiosity more than rational interest, or predetermined and
  invincible hostility. Our own dwelling was among those they thus visited; not
  only submitting to, but courting, the fullest and keenest inquiry with regard
  to the alleged "manifestations" from the spirit-world, by which they were
  attended.</p>

  <p>We devoted what time we could spare from our duties out of three days to
  this subject, and it would be the basest cowardice not to say that we are
  convinced beyond a doubt of their perfect integrity and good faith in the
  premises. Whatever may be the origin or cause of the "rappings," the ladies
  in whose presence they occur do not make them. We tested this thoroughly and
  to our entire satisfaction. Their conduct and bearing is as unlike that of
  deceivers as possible, and we think no one acquainted with them could believe
  them at all capable of engaging in so daring, impious, and shameful a juggle
  as this would be if they caused the sounds. And it is not possible that such
  a juggle should have been so long perpetrated in public. A juggler performs
  one feat quickly and hurries on to another; he does not devote weeks after
  weeks to the same thing over and over, deliberately, in full view of hundreds
  who sit beside or confronting him in broad daylight, not to enjoy but to
  detect his trick. A deceiver naturally avoids conversation on the subject of
  his knavery, but these ladies converse freely and fully with regard to the
  origin of these "rappings" in their dwellings years ago, the various
  sensations they caused, the neighbourhood excitement created, the progress of
  the developments&mdash;what they have seen, heard and experienced from first
  to last. If all were false, they could not fail to have involved themselves
  ere this in a labyrinth of blasting contradictions, as each separately gives
  accounts of the most astonishing developments at this or that time. Persons
  foolish enough so to commit themselves without reserve or caution could not
  have deferred a thorough self-exposure for a single week.</p>

  <p>Of course, a variety of opinions of so strange a matter would naturally be
  formed by the various persons who have visited them, and we presume that
  those who have merely run into their room for an hour or so, and listened,
  among a huddle of strangers, to a medley of questions&mdash;not all admitting
  of very profitable answers&mdash;put to certain invisible intelligences, and
  answered by "rappings," or singular noises on the floor, table, etc., as the
  alphabet was called over, or otherwise, would naturally go away, perhaps
  puzzled, probably disgusted, rarely convinced. It is hardly possible that a
  matter, ostensibly so grave, could be presented under circumstances less
  favourable to conviction. But of those who have enjoyed proper opportunities
  for a full investigation, we believe that fully three-fourths are convinced,
  as we are, that these singular sounds and seeming manifestations are not
  produced by Mrs. Fox and her daughters, nor by any human being connected with
  them.</p>

  <p>How they are caused, and whence they proceed, are questions which open a
  much wider field of inquiry, with whose way-marks we do not profess to be
  familiar. He must be well acquainted with the arcana of the universe, who
  shall presume dogmatically to decide that these manifestations are natural or
  supernatural. The ladies say that they are informed that this is but the
  beginning of a new era, or economy, in which spirits clothed in the flesh are
  to be more closely palpably connected with those who have put on immortality;
  that manifestations have already appeared in many other families and destined
  to be diffused and rendered clearer, until all who will may communicate
  freely with their friends who have "shuffled off this mortal coil." Of all
  this we know nothing, and shall guess nothing. But if we were simply to print
  (which we shall not) the questions asked and answers we received, during a
  two-hours' uninterrupted conference with the "rappers," we should at once be
  accused of having done so expressly to sustain the theory which regards these
  manifestations as the utterances of departed spirits. H.G.</p><br>

  <h3>NOTE TO CHAPTER VI</h3>

  <h3>PEN-PICTURE OF LAKE HARRIS BY LAURENCE OLIPHANT</h3>

  <p>There was a remarkable alternation of vivacity and deliberation about the
  movements of Mr. Masollam. His voice seemed pitched in two different keys,
  the effect of which was, when he changed them, to make one seem a distant
  echo of the other&mdash;a species of ventriloquistic phenomenon which was
  calculated to impart a sudden and not altogether pleasant shock to the nerves
  of the listeners. When he talked with what I may term his "near" voice, he
  was generally rapid and vivacious; when he exchanged it for his "far off"
  one, he was solemn and impressive. His hair, which had once been raven black,
  was now streaked with grey, but it was still thick and fell in a massive wave
  over his ears, and nearly to his shoulders, giving him something of a leonine
  aspect. His brow was overhanging and bushy, and his eyes were like revolving
  lights in two dark caverns, so fitfully did they seem to emit flashes and
  then lose all expression. Like his voice, they too had a near and a far-off
  expression, which could be adjusted to the required focus like a telescope,
  growing smaller and smaller as though in an effort to project the sight
  beyond the limits of natural vision. At such times they would be so entirely
  devoid of all appreciation of outward objects as to produce almost the
  impression of blindness, when suddenly the focus would change, the pupils
  expand, and rays flash from them like lightning from a thundercloud, giving
  an unexpected and extraordinary brilliancy to a face which seemed promptly to
  respond to the summons. The general cast of countenance, the upper part of
  which, were it not for the depth of the eye-sockets, would have been
  strikingly handsome, was decidedly Semitic; and in repose the general effect
  was almost statuesque in its calm fixedness. The mouth was partially
  concealed by a heavy moustache and long iron-grey beard; but the transition
  from repose to animation revealed an extraordinary flexibility in those
  muscles which had a moment before appeared so rigid, and the whole character
  of the countenance was altered as suddenly as the expression of the eye. It
  would perhaps be prying too much into the secrets of Nature, or, at all
  events, into the secrets of Mr. Masollam's nature, to inquire whether this
  lightening and darkening of the countenance was voluntary or not. In a lesser
  degree it is a common phenomenon with us all: the effect of one class of
  emotions is, vulgarly speaking, to make a man look black, and of another to
  make him look bright. The peculiarity of Mr. Masollam was that he could look
  so much blacker and brighter than most people, and made the change of
  expression with such extraordinary rapidity and intensity that it seemed a
  sort of facial legerdemain, and suggested the suspicion that it might be an
  acquired faculty. There was, moreover, another change which he apparently had
  the power of working on his countenance, which affects other people
  involuntarily, and which generally, especially in the case of the fair sex,
  does so very much against their will. Mr. Masollam had the faculty of looking
  very much older one hour than he did the next. "There were moments when a
  careful study of his wrinkles and of his dull, faded-looking eyes would lead
  you to put him down at eighty if he was a day; and there were others when his
  flashing glance, expanding nostril, broad, smooth brow and mobile mouth would
  make a rejuvenating combination that would for a moment convince you that you
  had been at least five-and-twenty years out in your first estimate. These
  rapid contrasts were calculated to arrest the attention of the most casual
  observer, and to produce a sensation which was not altogether pleasant when
  first one made his acquaintance. It was not exactly mistrust&mdash;for both
  manners were perfectly frank and natural&mdash;so much as perplexity. He
  seemed to be two opposite characters rolled into one, and to be presenting
  undesigningly a curious moral and physiological problem for solution, which
  had a disagreeable sort of attractiveness about it, for you almost
  immediately felt it to be insoluble, and yet it would not let you rest. He
  might be the best or the worst of men."</p><br>

  <h3>NOTES TO CHAPTER VII</h3>

  <h3>ADDITIONAL TESTIMONY OF PROFESSOR AND MRS. DE MORGAN</h3>

  <p class="first">Professor De Morgan says:</p>

  <p>I gave an account of all this to a friend who was then alive, a man of
  ologies and ometers both, who was not at all disposed to think it anything
  but a clever imposture. "But," said he, "what you tell me is very singular: I
  shall go myself to Mrs. Hayden; I shall go alone and not give my name. I
  don't think I shall hear anything from anybody, but if I do I shall find out
  the trick. Depend upon it,</p>

  <p>I shall find it out." He went accordingly, and came to me to report
  progress. He told me that he had gone a step beyond me, for he had insisted
  on taking his alphabet behind a large folding screen and asking his questions
  by the alphabet and a pencil, as well as receiving the answers. No persons
  except himself and Mrs. Hayden were in the room. The "spirit" who came to him
  was one whose unfortunate death was fully detailed in the usual way. My
  friend told me that he was "awestruck," and had nearly forgotten all his
  precautions.</p>

  <p>The things which I have narrated were the beginning of a long series of
  experiences, many as remarkable as what I have given; many of a minor
  character, separately worth little, but jointly of weight when considered in
  connexion with the more decisive proofs of reality. Many of a confirmatory
  tendency as mere facts, but of a character not sustentive of the gravity and
  dignity of the spiritual world. The celebrated apparition of Giles Scroggins
  is a serious personage compared to some which have fallen in my way, and a
  logical one, too. If these things be spirits, they show that pretenders,
  coxcombs and liars are to be found on the other side of the grave as well as
  on this; and what for no? as Meg Dods said.</p>

  <p>The whole question may receive such persevering attention as shall worm
  out the real truth; or it may die away, obtaining only casual notice, until a
  new outburst of phenomena recalls its history of this clay. But this
  subsidence does not seem to begin. It is now twelve or thirteen years since
  the matter began to be everywhere talked about, during which time there have
  been many announcements of the total extinction of the "spirit-mania." But in
  several cases, as in Tom Moore's fable, the extinguishers have caught fire.
  Were it the absurdity it is often said to be, it would do much good by
  calling attention to the "manifestations" of another absurdity, the
  philosophy of possibilities and impossibilities, the philosophy of the fourth
  court. Extremes meet, but the "meeting" is often for the purpose of mutual
  exposure, like that of silly gentlemen in the day of pop-and-paragraph duels.
  This on the supposition that Spiritualism is all either imposture or
  delusion; it cannot be more certainly one or the other than is the philosophy
  opposed to it. I have no acquaintance either with P or Q. But I feel sure
  that the decided conviction of all who can see both sides of the shield must
  be, that it is more likely that P has seen a ghost than that Q knows he
  cannot have seen one. I know that Q says he knows it.</p>

  <p>In this connexion the following from the Publishers' Circular on the
  appearance of Mrs. De Morgan's book shows a contemporary estimate of
  Professor De Morgan's critical faculty:</p>

  <p>Mere <i>litterateurs</i> and writers of fiction may be pardoned for a
  little tendency to the visionary and unreal, but the fact that the well-
  known author of the standard works on Formal Logic, the Differential
  Calculus, and the Theory of Probabilities, should figure with his lady in the
  characters of believers in spirit-rapping and table-turning, will probably
  take most people by surprise. There is perhaps no contributor to our reviews
  who is more at home in demolishing a fallacy, or in good-humouredly disposing
  of an ignorant pretender in science than Mr. De Morgan. His clear, logical,
  witty and whimsical style is readily traced by literary readers in many a
  striking article in our critical journals. He is probably the last man whom
  the sceptical in such mysteries would expect to find on the side of Mr. Home
  and Mrs. Newton Crosland. Yet we must record the fact that Mr. De Morgan
  declares himself " perfectly convinced that he has both seen and heard, in a
  manner which should make unbelief impossible, things called spiritual which
  cannot be taken by a rational being to be capable of explanation by
  imposture, coincidence, or mistake."</p>

  <p>Let us add to the foregoing Mrs. De Morgan's testimony:</p>

  <p>It is now ten years since I began attentively to observe the phenomena of
  "Spiritualism." My first experience occurred in the presence of Mrs. Hayden
  from New York. I never heard a word which could shake my strong conviction of
  Mrs. Hayden's honesty; indeed, the result of our first interview, when my
  name was quite unknown to her, was sufficient to prove that I was not on that
  occasion the victim of her imposture, or my own credulity.</p>

  <p>After describing the visit to Mrs. Hayden, to whom none of the names of
  those present was mentioned, she says:</p>

  <p>We sat for at least a quarter of an hour and were beginning to apprehend a
  failure, when a very small throbbing or patting sound was heard, apparently
  in the centre of the table. Great was our pleasure when Mrs. Hayden, who had
  before seemed rather anxious, said, "They are coming." Who were coming?
  Neither she nor we could tell. As the sounds gathered strength, which they
  seemed to do with our necessary conviction of their genuineness, whatever
  might be their origin, Mrs. Hayden said, "There is a spirit who wishes to
  speak with someone here, but as I do not know the names of the gentlemen and
  ladies, I must point to each in turn, and, when I come to the right one, beg
  that the spirit will rap." This was agreed to by our invisible companion, who
  rapped in assent. Mrs. Hayden then pointed to each of the party in turn. To
  my surprise, and even annoyance (for I did not wish this, and many of my
  friends did), no sounds were heard until she indicated myself, the last in
  the circle. I was seated at her right hand; she had gone round from the left.
  I was then directed to point to the letters of a large type alphabet, and I
  may add that, having no wish to obtain the name of any dear friend or
  relation, I certainly did not rest, as it has been surmised is often done, on
  any letter. However, to my astonishment, the not common name of a dear
  relation who had left this world seventeen years before, and whose surname
  was that of my father's, not my husband's, family was spelt. Then this
  sentence, "I am happy, and with F. and G." (names at length). I then received
  a promise of future communication with all three spirits; the two last had
  left the world twenty and twelve years before. Other persons present then
  received communications by rapping; of these some were as singularly truthful
  and satisfactory as that to myself, while others were false and even
  mischievous.</p>

  <p>Mrs. De Morgan observes that after the séances with Mrs. Hayden she and
  her friends experimented in private, "and it was found that a number of
  persons, both in and out of my own family, possessed the faculty of
  mediumship in a greater or less degree."</p><br>

  <h3>NOTE TO CHAPTER X</h3>

  <h3>WERE THE DAVENPORTS JUGGLERS OR SPIRITUALISTS?</h3>

  <p>As Mr. Houdini has seemed to question whether the Davenports themselves
  ever asserted that they were Spiritualists, it may clear the matter up
  finally to quote the following from a letter written by them in 1868 to the
  <i>Banner Of Light</i>, the leading Spiritualist journal in the United
  States. Dealing with the report that they were not Spiritualists, they
  wrote:</p>

  <p>It is singular that any individual, sceptic or Spiritualist, could believe
  such statements after fourteen years of the most bitter persecution and
  violent opposition, culminating in the riots of Liverpool, Huddersfield, and
  Leeds, where our lives were placed in imminent peril by the fury of brutal
  mobs, our property destroyed, and where we suffered a loss of seventy-five
  thousand dollars, and all because we would not renounce Spiritualism, and
  declare ourselves jugglers, when threatened by the mob, and urged to do so.
  In conclusion, we have only to say that we denounce all such statements as
  base falsehoods.</p>
