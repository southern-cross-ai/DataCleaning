<h2>1941</h2>

<hr>

<p>It was a summer's night and they were talking, in the big room
with the windows open to the garden, about the cesspool. The county
council had promised to bring water to the village, but they
hadn't.</p>

<p>Mrs. Haines, the wife of the gentleman farmer, a goosefaced
woman with eyes protruding as if they saw something to gobble in
the gutter, said affectedly: "What a subject to talk about on a
night like this!"</p>

<p>Then there was silence; and a cow coughed; and that led her to
say how odd it was, as a child, she had never feared cows, only
horses. But, then, as a small child in a perambulator, a great
cart-horse had brushed within an inch of her face. Her family, she
told the old man in the arm-chair, had lived near Liskeard for many
centuries. There were the graves in the churchyard to prove it.</p>

<p>A bird chuckled outside. "A nightingale?" asked Mrs. Haines. No,
nightingales didn't come so far north. It was a daylight bird,
chuckling over the substance and succulence of the day, over worms,
snails, grit, even in sleep.</p>

<p>The old man in the arm-chair&mdash;Mr. Oliver, of the Indian
Civil Service, retired&mdash;said that the site they had chosen for
the cesspool was, if he had heard aright, on the Roman road. From
an aeroplane, he said, you could still see, plainly marked, the
scars made by the Britons; by the Romans; by the Elizabethan manor
house; and by the plough, when they ploughed the hill to grow wheat
in the Napoleonic wars.</p>

<p>"But you don't remember..." Mrs. Haines began. No, not that.
Still he did remember&mdash;and he was about to tell them what,
when there was a sound outside, and Isa, his son's wife, came in
with her hair in pigtails; she was wearing a dressing-gown with
faded peacocks on it. She came in like a swan swimming its way;
then was checked and stopped; was surprised to find people there;
and lights burning. She had been sitting with her little boy who
wasn't well, she apologized. What had they been saying?</p>

<p>"Discussing the cesspool," said Mr. Oliver.</p>

<p>"What a subject to talk about on a night like this!" Mrs. Haines
exclaimed again.</p>

<p>What had <i>he</i> said about the cesspool; or indeed about
anything? Isa wondered, inclining her head towards the gentleman
farmer, Rupert Haines. She had met him at a Bazaar; and at a tennis
party. He had handed her a cup and a racquet&mdash;that was all.
But in his ravaged face she always felt mystery; and in his
silence, passion. At the tennis party she had felt this, and at the
Bazaar. Now a third time, if anything more strongly, she felt it
again.</p>

<p>"I remember," the old man interrupted, "my mother..." Of his
mother he remembered that she was very stout; kept her tea-caddy
locked; yet had given him in that very room a copy of Byron. It was
over sixty years ago, he told them, that his mother had given him
the works of Byron in that very room. He paused.</p>

<p>"She walks in beauty like the night," he quoted.</p>

<p>Then again:</p>

<p>"So we'll go no more a-roving by the light of the moon."</p>

<p>Isa raised her head. The words made two rings, perfect rings,
that floated them, herself and Haines, like two swans down stream.
But his snow-white breast was circled with a tangle of dirty
duckweed; and she too, in her webbed feet was entangled, by her
husband, the stockbroker. Sitting on her three-cornered chair she
swayed, with her dark pigtails hanging, and her body like a bolster
in its faded dressing-gown.</p>

<p>Mrs. Haines was aware of the emotion circling them, excluding
her. She waited, as one waits for the strain of an organ to die out
before leaving church. In the car going home to the red villa in
the cornfields, she would destroy it, as a thrush pecks the wings
off a butterfly. Allowing ten seconds to intervene, she rose;
paused; and then, as if she had heard the last strain die out,
offered Mrs. Giles Oliver her hand.</p>

<p>But Isa, though she should have risen at the same moment that
Mrs. Haines rose, sat on. Mrs. Haines glared at her out of
goose-like eyes, gobbling, "Please, Mrs. Giles Oliver, do me the
kindness to recognize my existence..." which she was forced to do,
rising at last from her chair, in her faded dressing-gown, with the
pigtails falling over each shoulder.</p>

<p>Pointz Hall was seen in the light of an early summer morning to
be a middle-sized house. It did not rank among the houses that are
mentioned in guide books. It was too homely. But this whitish house
with the grey roof, and the wing thrown out at right angles, lying
unfortunately low on the meadow with a fringe of trees on the bank
above it so that smoke curled up to the nests of the rooks, was a
desirable house to live in. Driving past, people said to each
other: "I wonder if that'll ever come into the market?" And to the
chauffeur: "Who lives there?"</p>

<p>The chauffeur didn't know. The Olivers, who had bought the place
something over a century ago, had no connection with the Warings,
the Elveys, the Mannerings or the Burnets; the old families who had
all intermarried, and lay in their deaths intertwisted, like the
ivy roots, beneath the churchyard wall.</p>

<p>Only something over a hundred and twenty years the Olivers had
been there. Still, on going up the principal staircase&mdash;there
was another, a mere ladder at the back for the servants&mdash;there
was a portrait. A length of yellow brocade was visible half-way up;
and, as one reached the top, a small powdered face, a great
head-dress slung with pearls, came into view; an ancestress of
sorts. Six or seven bedrooms opened out of the corridor. The butler
had been a soldier; had married a lady's maid; and, under a glass
case there was a watch that had stopped a bullet on the field of
Waterloo.</p>

<p>It was early morning. The dew was on the grass. The church clock
struck eight times. Mrs. Swithin drew the curtain in her
bedroom&mdash;the faded white chintz that so agreeably from the
outside tinged the window with its green lining. There with her old
hands on the hasp, jerking it open, she stood: old Oliver's married
sister; a widow. She always meant to set up a house of her own;
perhaps in Kensington, perhaps at Kew, so that she could have the
benefit of the gardens. But she stayed on all through the summer;
and when winter wept its damp upon the panes, and choked the
gutters with dead leaves, she said: "Why, Bart, did they build the
house in the hollow, facing north?" Her brother said, "Obviously to
escape from nature. Weren't four horses needed to drag the family
coach through the mud?" Then he told her the famous story of the
great eighteenth-century winter; when for a whole month the house
had been blocked by snow. And the trees had fallen. So every year,
when winter came, Mrs. Swithin retired to Hastings.</p>

<p>But it was summer now. She had been waked by the birds. How they
sang! attacking the dawn like so many choir boys attacking an iced
cake. Forced to listen, she had stretched for her favourite
reading&mdash;an Outline of History&mdash;and had spent the hours
between three and five thinking of rhododendron forests in
Piccadilly; when the entire continent, not then, she understood,
divided by a channel, was all one; populated, she understood, by
elephant-bodied, seal-necked, heaving, surging, slowly writhing,
and, she supposed, barking monsters; the iguanodon, the mammoth,
and the mastodon; from whom presumably, she thought, jerking the
window open, we descend.</p>

<p>It took her five seconds in actual time, in mind time ever so
much longer, to separate Grace herself, with blue china on a tray,
from the leather-covered grunting monster who was about, as the
door opened, to demolish a whole tree in the green steaming
undergrowth of the primeval forest. Naturally, she jumped, as Grace
put the tray down and said: "Good morning, Ma'am." "Batty," Grace
called her, as she felt on her face the divided glance that was
half meant for a beast in a swamp, half for a maid in a print frock
and white apron.</p>

<p>"How those birds sing!" said Mrs. Swithin, at a venture. The
window was open now; the birds certainly were singing. An obliging
thrush hopped across the lawn; a coil of pinkish rubber twisted in
its beak. Tempted by the sight to continue her imaginative
reconstruction of the past, Mrs. Swithin paused; she was given to
increasing the bounds of the moment by flights into past or future;
or sidelong down corridors and alleys; but she remembered her
mother&mdash;her mother in that very room rebuking her. "Don't
stand gaping, Lucy, or the wind'll change..." How often her mother
had rebuked her in that very room&mdash;"but in a very different
world," as her brother would remind her. So she sat down to morning
tea, like any other old lady with a high nose, thin cheeks, a ring
on her finger and the usual trappings of rather shabby but gallant
old age, which included in her case a cross gleaming gold on her
breast.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The nurses after breakfast were trundling the perambulator up
and down the terrace; and as they trundled they were
talking&mdash;not shaping pellets of information or handing ideas
from one to another, but rolling words, like sweets on their
tongues; which, as they thinned to transparency, gave off pink,
green, and sweetness. This morning that sweetness was: "How cook
had told 'im off about the asparagus; how when she rang I said: how
it was a sweet costume with blouse to match;" and that was leading
to something about a feller as they walked up and down the terrace
rolling sweets, trundling the perambulator.</p>

<p>It was a pity that the man who had built Pointz Hall had pitched
the house in a hollow, when beyond the flower garden and the
vegetables there was this stretch of high ground. Nature had
provided a site for a house; man had built his house in a hollow.
Nature had provided a stretch of turf half a mile in length and
level, till it suddenly dipped to the lily pool. The terrace was
broad enough to take the entire shadow of one of the great trees
laid flat. There you could walk up and down, up and down, under the
shade of the trees. Two or three grew close together; then there
were gaps. Their roots broke the turf, and among those bones were
green waterfalls and cushions of grass in which violets grew in
spring or in summer the wild purple orchis.</p>

<p>Amy was saying something about a feller when Mabel, with her
hand on the pram, turned sharply, her sweet swallowed. "Leave off
grubbing," she said sharply. "Come along, George."</p>

<p>The little boy had lagged and was grouting in the grass. Then
the baby, Caro, thrust her fist out over the coverlet and the furry
bear was jerked overboard. Amy had to stoop. George grubbed. The
flower blazed between the angles of the roots. Membrane after
membrane was torn. It blazed a soft yellow, a lambent light under a
film of velvet; it filled the caverns behind the eyes with light.
All that inner darkness became a hall, leaf smelling, earth
smelling of yellow light. And the tree was beyond the flower; the
grass, the flower and the tree were entire. Down on his knees
grubbing he held the flower complete. Then there was a roar and a
hot breath and a stream of coarse grey hair rushed between him and
the flower. Up he leapt, toppling in his fright, and saw coming
towards him a terrible peaked eyeless monster moving on legs,
brandishing arms.</p>

<p>"Good morning, sir," a hollow voice boomed at him from a beak of
paper.</p>

<p>The old man had sprung upon him from his hiding-place behind a
tree.</p>

<p>"Say good morning, George; say 'Good morning, Grandpa,'" Mabel
urged him, giving him a push towards the man. But George stood
gaping. George stood gazing. Then Mr. Oliver crumpled the paper
which he had cocked into a snout and appeared in person. A very
tall old man, with gleaming eyes, wrinkled cheeks, and a head with
no hair on it. He turned.</p>

<p>"Heel!" he bawled, "heel, you brute!" And George turned; and the
nurses turned holding the furry bear; they all turned to look at
Sohrab the Afghan hound bounding and bouncing among the
flowers.</p>

<p>"Heel!" the old man bawled, as if he were commanding a regiment.
It was impressive, to the nurses, the way an old boy of his age
could still bawl and make a brute like that obey him. Back came the
Afghan hound, sidling, apologetic. And as he cringed at the old
man's feet, a string was slipped over his collar; the noose that
old Oliver always carried with him.</p>

<p>"You wild beast...you bad beast," he grumbled, stooping. George
looked at the dog only. The hairy flanks were sucked in and out;
there was a blob of foam on its nostrils. He burst out crying.</p>

<p>Old Oliver raised himself, his veins swollen, his cheeks
flushed; he was angry. His little game with the paper hadn't
worked. The boy was a cry-baby. He nodded and sauntered on,
smoothing out the crumpled paper and muttering, as he tried to find
his line in the column, "A cry-baby&mdash;a cry-baby." But the
breeze blew the great sheet out; and over the edge he surveyed the
landscape&mdash;flowing fields, heath and woods. Framed, they
became a picture. Had he been a painter, he would have fixed his
easel here, where the country, barred by trees, looked like a
picture. Then the breeze fell.</p>

<p>"M. Daladier," he read finding his place in the column, "has
been successful in pegging down the franc..."</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mrs. Giles Oliver drew the comb through the thick tangle of hair
which, after giving the matter her best attention, she had never
had shingled or bobbed; and lifted the heavily embossed silver
brush that had been a wedding present and had its uses in
impressing chambermaids in hotels. She lifted it and stood in front
of the three-folded mirror, so that she could see three separate
versions of her rather heavy, yet handsome, face; and also, outside
the glass, a slip of terrace, lawn and tree tops.</p>

<p>Inside the glass, in her eyes, she saw what she had felt
overnight for the ravaged, the silent, the romantic gentleman
farmer. "In love," was in her eyes. But outside, on the washstand,
on the dressing-table, among the silver boxes and tooth-brushes,
was the other love; love for her husband, the
stockbroker&mdash;"The father of my children," she added, slipping
into the clich&eacute; conveniently provided by fiction. Inner love
was in the eyes; outer love on the dressing-table. But what feeling
was it that stirred in her now when above the looking-glass, out of
doors, she saw coming across the lawn the perambulator; two nurses;
and her little boy George, lagging behind?</p>

<p>She tapped on the window with her embossed hairbrush. They were
too far off to hear. The drone of the trees was in their ears; the
chirp of birds; other incidents of garden life, inaudible,
invisible to her in the bedroom, absorbed them. Isolated on a green
island, hedged about with snowdrops, laid with a counterpane of
puckered silk, the innocent island floated under her window. Only
George lagged behind.</p>

<p>She returned to her eyes in the looking-glass. "In love," she
must be; since the presence of his body in the room last night
could so affect her; since the words he said, handing her a teacup,
handing her a tennis racquet, could so attach themselves to a
certain spot in her; and thus lie between them like a wire,
tingling, tangling, vibrating&mdash;she groped, in the depths of
the looking-glass, for a word to fit the infinitely quick
vibrations of the aeroplane propeller that she had seen once at
dawn at Croydon. Faster, faster, faster, it whizzed, whirred,
buzzed, till all the flails became one flail and up soared the
plane away and away...</p>

<p>"Where we know not, where we go not, neither know nor care," she
hummed. "Flying, rushing through the ambient, incandescent, summer
silent..."</p>

<p>The rhyme was "air." She put down her brush. She took up the
telephone.</p>

<p>"Three, four, eight, Pyecombe," she said.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Oliver speaking....What fish have you this morning? Cod?
Halibut? Sole? Plaice?"</p>

<p>"There to lose what binds us here," she murmured. "Soles.
Filleted. In time for lunch please," she said aloud. "With a
feather, a blue feather...flying mounting through the air...there
to lose what binds us here..." The words weren't worth writing in
the book bound like an account book in case Giles suspected.
"Abortive," was the word that expressed her. She never came out of
a shop, for example, with the clothes she admired; nor did her
figure, seen against the dark roll of trousering in a shop window,
please her. Thick of waist, large of limb, and, save for her hair,
fashionable in the tight modern way, she never looked like Sappho,
or one of the beautiful young men whose photographs adorned the
weekly papers. She looked what she was: Sir Richard's daughter; and
niece of the two old ladies at Wimbledon who were so proud, being
O'Neils, of their descent from the Kings of Ireland.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A foolish, flattering lady, pausing on the threshold of what she
once called "the heart of the house," the threshold of the library,
had once said: "Next to the kitchen, the library's always the
nicest room in the house." Then she added, stepping across the
threshold: "Books are the mirrors of the soul."</p>

<p>In this case a tarnished, a spotted soul. For as the train took
over three hours to reach this remote village in the very heart of
England, no one ventured so long a journey, without staving off
possible mind-hunger, without buying a book on a bookstall. Thus
the mirror that reflected the soul sublime, reflected also the soul
bored. Nobody could pretend, as they looked at the shuffle of
shilling shockers that week-enders had dropped, that the
looking-glass always reflected the anguish of a Queen or the
heroism of King Harry.</p>

<p>At this early hour of a June morning the library was empty. Mrs.
Giles had to visit the kitchen. Mr. Oliver still tramped the
terrace. And Mrs. Swithin was of course at church. The light but
variable breeze, foretold by the weather expert, flapped the yellow
curtain, tossing light, then shadow. The fire greyed, then glowed,
and the tortoiseshell butterfly beat on the lower pane of the
window; beat, beat, beat; repeating that if no human being ever
came, never, never, never, the books would be mouldy, the fire out
and the tortoiseshell butterfly dead on the pane.</p>

<p>Heralded by the impetuosity of the Afghan hound, the old man
entered. He had read his paper; he was drowsy; and so sank down
into the chintz-covered chair with the dog at his feet&mdash;the
Afghan hound. His nose on his paws, his haunches drawn up, he
looked a stone dog, a crusader's dog, guarding even in the realms
of death the sleep of his master. But the master was not dead; only
dreaming; drowsily, seeing as in a glass, its lustre spotted,
himself, a young man helmeted; and a cascade falling. But no water;
and the hills, like grey stuff pleated; and in the sand a hoop of
ribs; a bullock maggot-eaten in the sun; and in the shadow of the
rock, savages; and in his hand a gun. The dream hand clenched; the
real hand lay on the chair arm, the veins swollen but only with a
brownish fluid now.</p>

<p>The door opened.</p>

<p>"Am I," Isa apologized, "interrupting?"</p>

<p>Of course she was&mdash;destroying youth and India. It was his
fault, since she had persisted in stretching his thread of life so
fine, so far. Indeed he was grateful to her, watching her as she
strolled about the room, for continuing.</p>

<p>Many old men had only their India&mdash;old men in clubs, old
men in rooms off Jermyn Street. She in her striped dress continued
him, murmuring, in front of the book cases: "The moor is dark
beneath the moon, rapid clouds have drunk the last pale beams of
even....I have ordered the fish," she said aloud, turning, "though
whether it'll be fresh or not I can't promise. But veal is dear,
and everybody in the house is sick of beef and mutton...Sohrab,"
she said, coming to a standstill in front of them, "What's
<i>he</i> been doing?"</p>

<p>His tail never wagged. He never admitted the ties of
domesticity. Either he cringed or he bit. Now his wild yellow eyes
gazed at her, gazed at him. He could outstare them both. Then
Oliver remembered:</p>

<p>"Your little boy's a cry-baby," he said scornfully.</p>

<p>"Oh," she sighed, pegged down on a chair arm, like a captive
balloon, by a myriad of hair-thin ties into domesticity. "What's
been happening?"</p>

<p>"I took the newspaper," he explained, "so..."</p>

<p>He took it and crumpled it into a beak over his nose. "So," he
had sprung out from behind a tree on to the children.</p>

<p>"And he howled. He's a coward, your boy is."</p>

<p>She frowned. He was not a coward, her boy wasn't. And she
loathed the domestic, the possessive; the maternal. And he knew it
and did it on purpose to tease her, the old brute, her
father-in-law.</p>

<p>She looked away.</p>

<p>"The library's always the nicest room in the house," she quoted,
and ran her eyes along the books. "The mirror of the soul" books
were. <i>The Faerie Queene</i> and Kinglake's <i>Crimea;</i> Keats
and the <i>Kreutzer Sonata.</i> There they were, reflecting. What?
What remedy was there for her at her age&mdash;the age of the
century, thirty-nine&mdash;in books? Book-shy she was, like the
rest of her generation; and gun-shy too. Yet as a person with a
raging tooth runs her eye in a chemist shop over green bottles with
gilt scrolls on them lest one of them may contain a cure, she
considered: Keats and Shelley; Yeats and Donne. Or perhaps not a
poem; a life. The life of Garibaldi. The life of Lord Palmerston.
Or perhaps not a person's life; a county's. <i>The Antiquities of
Durham; The Proceedings of the Arch&aelig;ological Society of
Nottingham.</i> Or not a life at all, but science&mdash;Eddington,
Darwin, or Jeans.</p>

<p>None of them stopped her toothache. For her generation the
newspaper was a book; and, as her father-in-law had dropped the
<i>Times,</i> she took it and read: "A horse with a green tail..."
which was fantastic. Next, "The guard at Whitehall..." which was
romantic and then, building word upon word she read: "The troopers
told her the horse had a green tail; but she found it was just an
ordinary horse. And they dragged her up to the barrack room where
she was thrown upon a bed. Then one of the troopers removed part of
her clothing, and she screamed and hit him about the face..."</p>

<p>That was real; so real that on the mahogany door panels she saw
the Arch in Whitehall; through the Arch the barrack room; in the
barrack room the bed, and on the bed the girl was screaming and
hitting him about the face, when the door (for in fact it was a
door) opened and in came Mrs. Swithin carrying a hammer.</p>

<p>She advanced, sidling, as if the floor were fluid under her
shabby garden shoes, and, advancing, pursed her lips and smiled,
sidelong, at her brother. Not a word passed between them as she
went to the cupboard in the corner and replaced the hammer, which
she had taken without asking leave; together&mdash;she unclosed her
fist&mdash;with a handful of nails.</p>

<p>"Cindy&mdash;Cindy," he growled, as she shut the cupboard
door.</p>

<p>Lucy, his sister, was three years younger than he was. The name
Cindy, or Sindy, for it could be spelt either way, was short for
Lucy. It was by this name that he had called her when they were
children; when she had trotted after him as he fished, and had made
the meadow flowers into tight little bunches, winding one long
grass stalk round and round and round. Once, she remembered, he had
made her take the fish off the hook herself. The blood had shocked
her&mdash;"Oh!" she had cried&mdash;for the gills were full of
blood. And he had growled: "Cindy!" The ghost of that morning in
the meadow was in her mind as she replaced the hammer where it
belonged on one shelf; and the nails where they belonged on
another; and shut the cupboard about which, for he still kept his
fishing tackle there, he was still so very particular.</p>

<p>"I've been nailing the placard on the Barn," she said, giving
him a little pat on the shoulder.</p>

<p>The words were like the first peal of a chime of bells. As the
first peals, you hear the second; as the second peals, you hear the
third. So when Isa heard Mrs. Swithin say: "I've been nailing the
placard to the Barn," she knew she would say next:</p>

<p>"For the pageant."</p>

<p>And he would say:</p>

<p>"Today? By Jupiter! I'd forgotten!"</p>

<p>"If it's fine," Mrs. Swithin continued, "they'll act on the
terrace..."</p>

<p>"And if it's wet," Bartholomew continued, "in the Barn."</p>

<p>"And which will it be?" Mrs. Swithin continued. "Wet or
fine?"</p>

<p>Then, for the seventh time in succession, they both looked out
of the window.</p>

<p>Every summer, for seven summers now, Isa had heard the same
words; about the hammer and the nails; the pageant and the weather.
Every year they said, would it be wet or fine; and every year it
was&mdash;one or the other. The same chime followed the same chime,
only this year beneath the chime she heard: "The girl screamed and
hit him about the face with a hammer."</p>

<p>"The forecast," said Mr. Oliver, turning the pages till he found
it, "says: Variable winds; fair average temperature; rain at
times."</p>

<p>He put down the paper, and they all looked at the sky to see
whether the sky obeyed the meteorologist. Certainly the weather was
variable. It was green in the garden; grey the next. Here came the
sun&mdash;an illimitable rapture of joy, embracing every flower,
every leaf. Then in compassion it withdrew, covering its face, as
if it forebore to look on human suffering. There was a
fecklessness, a lack of symmetry and order in the clouds, as they
thinned and thickened. Was it their own law, or no law, they
obeyed? Some were wisps of white hair merely. One, high up, very
distant, had hardened to golden alabaster; was made of immortal
marble. Beyond that was blue, pure blue, black blue; blue that had
never filtered down; that had escaped registration. It never fell
as sun, shadow, or rain upon the world, but disregarded the little
coloured ball of earth entirely. No flower felt it; no field; no
garden.</p>

<p>Mrs. Swithin's eyes glazed as she looked at it. Isa thought her
gaze was fixed because she saw God there, God on his throne. But as
a shadow fell next moment on the garden Mrs. Swithin loosed and
lowered her fixed look and said:</p>

<p>"It's very unsettled. It'll rain, I'm afraid. We can only pray,"
she added, and fingered her crucifix.</p>

<p>"And provide umbrellas," said her brother.</p>

<p>Lucy flushed. He had struck her faith. When she said "pray," he
added "umbrellas." She half covered the cross with her fingers. She
shrank; she cowered; but next moment she exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Oh there they are&mdash;the darlings!"</p>

<p>The perambulator was passing across the lawn.</p>

<p>Isa looked too. What an angel she was&mdash;the old woman! Thus
to salute the children; to beat up against those immensities and
the old man's irreverences her skinny hands, her laughing eyes! How
courageous to defy Bart and the weather!</p>

<p>"He looks blooming," said Mrs. Swithin.</p>

<p>"It's astonishing how they pick up," said Isa.</p>

<p>"He ate his breakfast?" Mrs. Swithin asked.</p>

<p>"Every scrap," said Isa.</p>

<p>"And baby? No sign of measles?"</p>

<p>Isa shook her head. "Touch wood," she added, tapping the
table.</p>

<p>"Tell me, Bart," said Mrs. Swithin turning to her brother,
"what's the origin of that? Touch wood...Antaeus, didn't he touch
earth?"</p>

<p>She would have been, he thought, a very clever woman, had she
fixed her gaze. But this led to that; that to the other. What went
in at this ear, went out at that. And all were circled, as happens
after seventy, by one recurring question. Hers was, should she live
at Kensington or at Kew? But every year, when winter came, she did
neither. She took lodgings at Hastings.</p>

<p>"Touch wood; touch earth; Antaeus," he muttered, bringing the
scattered bits together. Lempriere would settle it; or the
Encyclop&aelig;dia. But it was not in books the answer to his
question&mdash;why, in Lucy's skull, shaped so much like his own,
there existed a prayable being? She didn't, he supposed, invest it
with hair, teeth or toe-nails. It was, he supposed more of a force
or a radiance, controlling the thrush and the worm; the tulip and
the hound; and himself, too, an old man with swollen veins. It got
her out of bed on a cold morning and sent her down the muddy path
to worship it, whose mouthpiece was Streatfield. A good fellow, who
smoked cigars in the vestry. He needed some solace, doling out
preachments to asthmatic elders, perpetually repairing the
perpetually falling steeple, by means of placards nailed to Barns.
The love, he was thinking, that they should give to flesh and blood
they give to the church...when Lucy rapping her fingers on the
table said:</p>

<p>"What's the origin&mdash;the origin&mdash;of that?"</p>

<p>"Superstition," he said.</p>

<p>She flushed, and the little breath too was audible that she drew
in as once more he struck a blow at her faith. But, brother and
sister, flesh and blood was not a barrier, but a mist. Nothing
changed their affection; no argument; no fact; no truth. What she
saw he didn't; what he saw she didn't&mdash;and so on, <i>ad
infinitum.</i></p>

<p>"Cindy," he growled. And the quarrel was over.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Barn to which Lucy had nailed her placard was a great
building in the farmyard. It was as old as the church, and built of
the same stone, but it had no steeple. It was raised on cones of
grey stone at the corners to protect it from rats and damp. Those
who had been to Greece always said it reminded them of a temple.
Those who had never been to Greece&mdash;the majority&mdash;admired
it all the same. The roof was weathered red-orange; and inside it
was a hollow hall, sun-shafted, brown, smelling of corn, dark when
the doors were shut, but splendidly illuminated when the doors at
the end stood open, as they did to let the wagons in&mdash;the long
low wagons, like ships of the sea, breasting the corn, not the sea,
returning in the evening shagged with hay. The lanes caught tufts
where the wagons had passed.</p>

<p>Now benches were drawn across the floor of the Barn. If it
rained, the actors were to act in the Barn; planks had been laid
together at one end to form a stage. Wet or fine, the audience
would take tea there. Young men and women&mdash;Jim, Iris, David,
Jessica&mdash;were even now busy with garlands of red and white
paper roses left over from the Coronation. The seeds and the dust
from the sacks made them sneeze. Iris had a handkerchief bound
round her forehead; Jessica wore breeches. The young men worked in
shirt sleeves. Pale husks had stuck in their hair, and it was easy
to run a splinter of wood into the fingers.</p>

<p>"Old Flimsy" (Mrs. Swithin's nickname) had been nailing another
placard on the Barn. The first had been blown down, or the village
idiot, who always tore down what had been nailed up, had done it,
and was chuckling over the placard under the shade of some hedge.
The workers were laughing too, as if old Swithin had left a wake of
laughter behind her. The old girl with a wisp of white hair flying,
knobbed shoes as if she had claws corned like a canary's, and black
stockings wrinkled over the ankles, naturally made David cock his
eye and Jessica wink back, as she handed him a length of paper
roses. Snobs they were; long enough stationed that is in that one
corner of the world to have taken indelibly the print of some three
hundred years of customary behaviour. So they laughed; but
respected. If she wore pearls, pearls they were.</p>

<p>"Old Flimsy on the hop," said David. She would be in and out
twenty times, and finally bring them lemonade in a great jug and a
plate of sandwiches. Jessie held the garland; he hammered. A hen
strayed in; a file of cows passed the door; then a sheep dog; then
the cowman, Bond, who stopped.</p>

<p>He contemplated the young people hanging roses from one rafter
to another. He thought very little of anybody, simples or gentry.
Leaning, silent, sardonic, against the door he was like a withered
willow, bent over a stream, all its leaves shed, and in his eyes
the whimsical flow of the waters.</p>

<p>"Hi&mdash;huh!" he cried suddenly. It was cow language
presumably, for the parti-coloured cow, who had thrust her head in
at the door lowered her horns, lashed her tail and ambled off. Bond
followed after.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>"That's the problem," said Mrs. Swithin. While Mr. Oliver
consulted the Encyclop&aelig;dia searching under Superstition for
the origin of the expression "Touch Wood," she and Isa discussed
fish: whether, coming from a distance, it would be fresh.</p>

<p>They were so far from the sea. A hundred miles away, Mrs.
Swithin said; no, perhaps a hundred and fifty. "But they do say,"
she continued, "one can hear the waves on a still night. After a
storm, they say, you can hear a wave break....I like that story,"
she reflected. "Hearing the waves in the middle of the night he
saddled a horse and rode to the sea. Who was it, Bart, who rode to
the sea?"</p>

<p>He was reading.</p>

<p>"You can't expect it brought to your door in a pail of water,"
said Mrs. Swithin, "as I remember when we were children, living in
a house by the sea. Lobsters, fresh from the lobster pots. How they
pinched the stick cook gave them! And salmon. You know if they're
fresh because they have lice in their scales."</p>

<p>Bartholomew nodded. A fact that was. He remembered, the house by
the sea. And the lobster.</p>

<p>They were bringing up nets full of fish from the sea; but Isa
was seeing&mdash;the garden, variable as the forecast said, in the
light breeze. Again, the children passed, and she tapped on the
window and blew them a kiss. In the drone of the garden it went
unheeded.</p>

<p>"Are we really," she said, turning round, "a hundred miles from
the sea?"</p>

<p>"Thirty-five only," her father-in-law said, as if he had whipped
a tape measure from his pocket and measured it exactly.</p>

<p>"It seems more," said Isa. "It seems from the terrace as if the
land went on for ever and ever."</p>

<p>"Once there was no sea," said Mrs. Swithin. "No sea at all
between us and the continent. I was reading that in a book this
morning. There were rhododendrons in the Strand; and mammoths in
Piccadilly."</p>

<p>"When we were savages," said Isa.</p>

<p>Then she remembered; her dentist had told her that savages could
perform very skilful operations on the brain. Savages had false
teeth, he said. False teeth were invented, she thought he said, in
the time of the Pharaohs.</p>

<p>"At least so my dentist told me," she concluded.</p>

<p>"Which man d'you go to now?" Mrs. Swithin asked her.</p>

<p>"The same old couple; Batty and Bates in Sloane Street."</p>

<p>"And Mr. Batty told you they had false teeth in the time of the
Pharaohs?" Mrs. Swithin pondered.</p>

<p>"Batty? Oh not Batty. Bates," Isa corrected her.</p>

<p>Batty, she recalled, only talked about Royalty. Batty, she told
Mrs. Swithin, had a patient a Princess.</p>

<p>"So he kept me waiting well over an hour. And you know, when
one's a child, how long that seems."</p>

<p>"Marriages with cousins," said Mrs. Swithin, "can't be good for
the teeth."</p>

<p>Bart put his finger inside his mouth and projected the upper row
outside his lips. They were false. Yet, he said, the Olivers hadn't
married cousins. The Olivers couldn't trace their descent for more
than two or three hundred years. But the Swithins could. The
Swithins were there before the Conquest.</p>

<p>"The Swithins," Mrs. Swithin began. Then she stopped. Bart would
crack another joke about Saints, if she gave him the chance. And
she had had two jokes cracked at her already; one about an
umbrella; another about superstition.</p>

<p>So she stopped and said, "How did we begin this talk?" She
counted on her fingers. "The Pharaohs. Dentists. Fish...Oh yes, you
were saying, Isa, you'd ordered fish; and you were afraid it
wouldn't be fresh. And I said 'That's the problem...'"</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The fish had been delivered, Mitchell's boy, holding them in a
crook of his arm, jumped off his motor bike. There was no feeding
the pony with lumps of sugar at the kitchen door, nor time for
gossip, since his round had been increased. He had to deliver right
over the hill at Bickley; also go round by Waythorn, Roddam, and
Pyeminster, whose names, like his own, were in Domesday Book. But
the cook&mdash;Mrs. Sands she was called, but by old friends
Trixie&mdash;had never in all her fifty years been over the hill,
nor wanted to.</p>

<p>He dabbed them down on the kitchen table, the filleted soles,
the semi-transparent boneless fish. And before Mrs. Sands had time
to peel the paper off, he was gone, giving a slap to the very fine
yellow cat who rose majestically from the basket chair and advanced
superbly to the table, winding the fish.</p>

<p>Were they a bit whiffy? Mrs. Sands held them to her nose. The
cat rubbed itself this way, that way against the table legs,
against her legs. She would save a slice for Sunny&mdash;his
drawing-room name Sung-Yen had undergone a kitchen change into
Sunny. She took them, the cat attendant, to the larder, and laid
them on a plate in that semi-ecclesiastical apartment. For the
house before the Reformation, like so many houses in that
neighbourhood, had a chapel; and the chapel had become a larder,
changing, like the cat's name, as religion changed. The Master (his
drawing-room name; in the kitchen they called him Bartie) would
bring gentlemen sometimes to see the larder&mdash;often when cook
wasn't dressed. Not to see the hams that hung from hooks, or the
butter on a blue slate, or the joint for tomorrow's dinner, but to
see the cellar that opened out of the larder and its carved arch.
If you tapped&mdash;one gentleman had a hammer&mdash;there was a
hollow sound; a reverberation; undoubtedly, he said, a concealed
passage where once somebody had hid. So it might be. But Mrs. Sands
wished they wouldn't come into her kitchen telling stories with the
girls about. It put ideas into their silly heads. They heard dead
men rolling barrels. They saw a white lady walking under the trees.
No one would cross the terrace after dark. If a cat sneezed,
"There's the ghost!"</p>

<p>Sunny had his little bit off the fillet. Then Mrs. Sands took an
egg from the brown basket full of eggs; some with yellow fluff
sticking to the shells; then a pinch of flour to coat those
semi-transparent slips; and a crust from the great earthenware
crock full of crusts. Then, returning to the kitchen, she made
those quick movements at the oven, cinder raking, stoking, damping,
which sent strange echoes through the house, so that in the
library, the sitting-room, the dining-room, and the nursery,
whatever they were doing, thinking, saying, they knew, they all
knew, it was getting on for breakfast, lunch, or dinner.</p>

<p>"The sandwiches..." said Mrs. Swithin, coming into the kitchen.
She refrained from adding "Sands" to "sandwiches," for Sand and
sandwiches clashed. "Never play," her mother used to say, "on
people's names." And Trixie was not a name that suited, as Sands
did, the thin, acid woman, red-haired, sharp and clean, who never
dashed off masterpieces, it was true; but then never dropped
hairpins in the soup. "What in the name of Thunder?" Bart had said,
raising a hairpin in his spoon, in the old days, fifteen years ago,
before Sands came, in the time of Jessie Pook.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sands fetched bread; Mrs. Swithin fetched ham. One cut the
bread; the other the ham. It was soothing, it was consolidating,
this handwork together. The cook's hands cut, cut, cut. Whereas
Lucy, holding the loaf, held the knife up. Why's stale bread, she
mused, easier to cut than fresh? And so skipped, sidelong, from
yeast to alcohol; so to fermentation; so to inebriation; so to
Bacchus; and lay under purple lamps in a vineyard in Italy, as she
had done, often; while Sands heard the clock tick; saw the cat;
noted a fly buzz; and registered, as her lips showed, a grudge she
mustn't speak against people making work in the kitchen while they
had a high old time hanging paper roses in the barn.</p>

<p>"Will it be fine?" asked Mrs. Swithin, her knife suspended. In
the kitchen they humoured old Mother Swithin's fancies.</p>

<p>"Seems like it," said Mrs. Sands, giving her sharp look-out of
the kitchen window.</p>

<p>"It wasn't last year," said Mrs. Swithin. "D'you remember what a
rush we had&mdash;when the rain came&mdash;getting in the chairs?"
She cut again. Then she asked about Billy, Mrs. Sands's nephew,
apprenticed to the butcher.</p>

<p>"He's been doing," Mrs. Sands said, "what boys shouldn't;
cheeking the master."</p>

<p>"That'll be all right," said Mrs. Swithin, half meaning the boy,
half meaning the sandwich, as it happened a very neat one, trimmed,
triangular.</p>

<p>"Mr. Giles may be late," she added, laying it, complacently, on
top of the pile.</p>

<p>For Isa's husband, the stockbroker, was coming from London. And
the local train, which met the express train, arrived by no means
punctually, even if he caught the early train which was by no means
certain. In which case it meant&mdash;but what it meant to Mrs.
Sands, when people missed their trains, and she, whatever she might
want to do, must wait, by the oven, keeping meat hot, no one
knew.</p>

<p>"There!" said Mrs. Swithin, surveying the sandwiches, some neat,
some not, "I'll take 'em to the barn." As for the lemonade, she
assumed, without a flicker of doubt, that Jane the kitchenmaid
would follow after.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Candish paused in the dining-room to move a yellow rose. Yellow,
white, carnation red&mdash;he placed them. He loved flowers, and
arranging them, and placing the green sword or heart shaped leaf
that came, fitly, between them. Queerly, he loved them, considering
his gambling and drinking. The yellow rose went there. Now all was
ready&mdash;silver and white, forks and napkins, and in the middle
the splashed bowl of variegated roses. So, with one last look, he
left the dining-room.</p>

<p>Two pictures hung opposite the window. In real life they had
never met, the long lady and the man holding his horse by the rein.
The lady was a picture, bought by Oliver because he liked the
picture; the man was an ancestor. He had a name. He held the rein
in his hand. He had said to the painter:</p>

<p>"It you want my likeness, dang it sir, take it when the leaves
are on the trees." There were leaves on the trees. He had said:
"Ain't there room for Colin as well as Buster?" Colin was his
famous hound. But there was only room for Buster. It was, he seemed
to say, addressing the company not the painter, a damned shame to
leave out Colin whom he wished buried at his feet, in the same
grave, about 1750; but that skunk the Reverend Whatshisname
wouldn't allow it.</p>

<p>He was a talk producer, that ancestor. But the lady was a
picture. In her yellow robe, leaning, with a pillar to support her,
a silver arrow in her hand, and a feather in her hair, she led the
eye up, down, from the curve to the straight, through glades of
greenery and shades of silver, dun and rose into silence. The room
was empty.</p>

<p>Empty, empty, empty; silent, silent, silent. The room was a
shell, singing of what was before time was; a vase stood in the
heart of the house, alabaster, smooth, cold, holding the still,
distilled essence of emptiness, silence.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Across the hall a door opened. One voice, another voice, a third
voice came wimpling and warbling: gruff&mdash;Bart's voice;
quavering&mdash;Lucy's voice; middle-toned&mdash;Isa's voice. Their
voices impetuously, impatiently, protestingly came across the hall
saying: "The train's late"; saying: "Keep it hot"; saying: "We
won't, no Candish, we won't wait."</p>

<p>Coming out from the library the voices stopped in the hall. They
encountered an obstacle evidently; a rock. Utterly impossible was
it, even in the heart of the country, to be alone? That was the
shock. After that, the rock was raced round, embraced. If it was
painful, it was essential. There must be society. Coming out of the
library it was painful, but pleasant, to run slap into Mrs. Manresa
and an unknown young man with tow-coloured hair and a twisted face.
No escape was possible; meeting was inevitable. Uninvited,
unexpected, droppers-in, lured off the high road by the very same
instinct that caused the sheep and the cows to desire propinquity,
they had come. But they had brought a lunch basket. Here it
was.</p>

<p>"We couldn't resist when we saw the name on the signpost," Mrs.
Manresa began in her rich fluty voice. "And this is a
friend&mdash;William Dodge. We were going to sit all alone in a
field. And I said: 'Why not ask our dear friends,' seeing the
signpost, 'to shelter us?' A seat at the table&mdash;that's all we
want. We have our grub. We have our glasses. We ask nothing
but&mdash;" society apparently, to be with her kind.</p>

<p>And she waved her hand upon which there was a glove, and under
the glove it seemed rings, at old Mr. Oliver.</p>

<p>He bowed deep over her hand; a century ago, he would have kissed
it. In all this sound of welcome, protestation, apology and again
welcome, there was an element of silence, supplied by Isabella,
observing the unknown young man. He was of course a gentleman;
witness socks and trousers; brainy&mdash;tie spotted, waistcoat
undone; urban, professional, that is putty coloured, unwholesome;
very nervous, exhibiting a twitch at this sudden introduction, and
fundamentally infernally conceited, for he deprecated Mrs.
Manresa's effusion, yet was her guest.</p>

<p>Isa felt antagonised, yet curious. But when Mrs. Manresa added,
to make all shipshape: "He's an artist," and when William Dodge
corrected her: "I'm a clerk in an office"&mdash;she thought he said
Education or Somerset House&mdash;she had her finger on the knot
which had tied itself so tightly, almost to the extent of
squinting, certainly of twitching, in his face.</p>

<p>Then they went in to lunch, and Mrs. Manresa bubbled up,
enjoying her own capacity to surmount, without turning a hair, this
minor social crisis&mdash;this laying of two more places. For had
she not complete faith in flesh and blood? and aren't we all flesh
and blood? and how silly to make bones of trifles when we're all
flesh and blood under the skin&mdash;men and women too! But she
preferred men&mdash;obviously.</p>

<p>"Or what are your rings for, and your nails, and that really
adorable little straw hat?" said Isabella addressing Mrs. Manresa
silently and thereby making silence add its unmistakable
contribution to talk. Her hat, her rings, her finger nails red as
roses, smooth as shells, were there for all to see. But not her
life history. That was only scraps and fragments to all of them,
excluding perhaps William Dodge, whom she called "Bill"
publicly&mdash;a sign perhaps that he knew more than they did. Some
of the things that he knew&mdash;that she strolled the garden at
midnight in silk pyjamas, had the loud speaker playing jazz, and a
cocktail bar, of course they knew also. But nothing private; no
strict biographical facts.</p>

<p>She had been born, but it was only gossip said so, in Tasmania:
her grandfather had been exported for some hanky-panky
mid-Victorian scandal; malversation of trusts was it? But the story
got no further the only time Isabella heard it than "exported," for
the husband of the communicative lady&mdash;Mrs. Blencowe of the
Grange&mdash;took exception, pedantically, to "exported," said
"expatriated" was more like it, but not the right word, which he
had on the tip of his tongue, but couldn't get at. And so the story
dwindled away. Sometimes she referred to an uncle, a Bishop. But he
was thought to have been a Colonial Bishop only. They forgot and
forgave very easily in the Colonies. Also it was said her diamonds
and rubies had been dug out of the earth with his own hands by a
"husband" who was not Ralph Manresa. Ralph, a Jew, got up to look
the very spit and image of the landed gentry, supplied from
directing City companies&mdash;that was certain&mdash;tons of
money; and they had no child. But surely with George the Sixth on
the throne it was old fashioned, dowdy, savoured of moth-eaten
furs, bugles, cameos and black-edged notepaper, to go ferreting
into people's pasts?</p>

<p>"All I need," said Mrs. Manresa ogling Candish, as if he were a
real man, not a stuffed man, "is a corkscrew." She had a bottle of
champagne, but no corkscrew.</p>

<p>"Look, Bill," she continued, cocking her thumb&mdash;she was
opening the bottle&mdash;"at the pictures. Didn't I tell you you'd
have a treat?"</p>

<p>Vulgar she was in her gestures, in her whole person, over-sexed,
over-dressed for a picnic. But what a desirable, at least valuable,
quality it was&mdash;for everybody felt, directly she spoke, "She's
said it, she's done it, not I," and could take advantage of the
breach of decorum, of the fresh air that blew in, to follow like
leaping dolphins in the wake of an ice-breaking vessel. Did she not
restore to old Bartholomew his spice islands, his youth?</p>

<p>"I told him," she went on, ogling Bart now, "that he wouldn't
look at our things" (of which they had heaps and mountains) "after
yours. And I promised him you'd show him the&mdash;the&mdash;" here
the champagne fizzed up and she insisted upon filling Bart's glass
first. "What is it all you learned gentlemen rave about? An arch?
Norman? Saxon? Who's the last from school? Mrs. Giles?"</p>

<p>She ogled Isabella now, conferring youth upon her; but always
when she spoke to women, she veiled her eyes, for they, being
conspirators, saw through it.</p>

<p>So with blow after blow, with champagne and ogling, she staked
out her claim to be a wild child of nature, blowing into
this&mdash;she did give one secret smile&mdash;sheltered harbour;
which did make her smile, after London; yet it did, too, challenge
London. For on she went to offer them a sample of her life; a few
gobbets of gossip; mere trash; but she gave it for what it was
worth; how last Tuesday she had been sitting next so and so; and
she added, very casually a Christian name; then a nickname; and
he'd said&mdash;for, as a mere nobody they didn't mind what they
said to her&mdash;and "in strict confidence, I needn't tell you,"
she told them. And they all pricked their ears. And then, with a
gesture of her hands as if tossing overboard that odious
crackling-under-the-pot London life&mdash;so&mdash;she exclaimed
"There!...And what's the first thing I do when I come down here?"
They had only come last night, driving through June lanes, alone
with Bill it was understood, leaving London, suddenly become
dissolute and dirty, to sit down to dinner. "What do I do? Can I
say it aloud? Is it permitted, Mrs. Swithin? Yes, everything can be
said in this house. I take off my stays" (here she pressed her
hands to her sides&mdash;she was stout) "and roll in the grass.
Roll&mdash;you'll believe that..." She laughed wholeheartedly. She
had given up dealing with her figure and thus gained freedom.</p>

<p>"That's genuine," Isa thought. Quite genuine. And her love of
the country too. Often when Ralph Manresa had to stay in town she
came down alone; wore an old garden hat; taught the village women
<i>not</i> how to pickle and preserve; but how to weave frivolous
baskets out of coloured straw. Pleasure's what they want she said.
You often heard her, if you called, yodelling among the hollyhocks
"Hoity te doity te ray do..."</p>

<p>A thorough good sort she was. She made old Bart feel young. Out
of the corner of his eye, as he raised his glass, he saw a flash of
white in the garden. Someone passing.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The scullery maid, before the plates came out, was cooling her
cheeks by the lily pond.</p>

<p>There had always been lilies there, self-sown from wind-dropped
seed, floating red and white on the green plates of their leaves.
Water, for hundreds of years, had silted down into the hollow, and
lay there four or five feet deep over a black cushion of mud. Under
the thick plate of green water, glazed in their self-centred world,
fish swam&mdash;gold, splashed with white, streaked with black or
silver. Silently they manoeuvred in their water world, poised in
the blue patch made by the sky, or shot silently to the edge where
the grass, trembling, made a fringe of nodding shadow. On the
water-pavement spiders printed their delicate feet. A grain fell
and spiralled down; a petal fell, filled and sank. At that the
fleet of boat-shaped bodies paused; poised; equipped; mailed; then
with a waver of undulation off they flashed.</p>

<p>It was in that deep centre, in that black heart, that the lady
had drowned herself. Ten years since the pool had been dredged and
a thigh bone recovered. Alas, it was a sheep's, not a lady's. And
sheep have no ghosts, for sheep have no souls. But, the servants
insisted, they must have a ghost; the ghost must be a lady's; who
had drowned herself for love. So none of them would walk by the
lily pool at night, only now when the sun shone and the gentry
still sat at table.</p>

<p>The flower petal sank; the maid returned to the kitchen;
Bartholomew sipped his wine. Happy he felt as a boy; yet reckless
as an old man; an unusual, an agreeable sensation. Fumbling in his
mind for something to say to the adorable lady, he chose the first
thing that came handy; the story of the sheep's thigh. "Servants,"
he said, "must have their ghost." Kitchenmaids must have their
drowned lady.</p>

<p>"But so must I!" cried the wild child of nature, Mrs. Manresa.
She became, of a sudden, solemn as an owl. She <i>knew,</i> she
said, pinching a bit of bread to make this emphatic, that Ralph,
when he was at the war, couldn't have been killed without her
seeing him&mdash;"wherever I was, whatever I was doing," she added,
waving her hands so that the diamonds flashed in the sun.</p>

<p>"I don't feel that," said Mrs. Swithin, shaking her head.</p>

<p>"No," Mrs. Manresa laughed. "You wouldn't. None of you would.
You see I'm on a level with..." she waited till Candish had
retired, "the servants. I'm nothing like so grown up as you
are."</p>

<p>She preened, approving her adolescence. Rightly or wrongly? A
spring of feeling bubbled up through her mud. They had laid theirs
with blocks of marble. Sheep's bones were sheep's bones to them,
not the relics of the drowned Lady Ermyntrude.</p>

<p>"And which camp," said Bartholomew turning to the unknown guest,
"d'you belong to? The grown, or the ungrown?"</p>

<p>Isabella opened her mouth, hoping that Dodge would open his, and
so enable her to place him. But he sat staring. "I beg your pardon,
sir?" he said. They all looked at him. "I was looking at the
pictures."</p>

<p>The picture looked at nobody. The picture drew them down the
paths of silence.</p>

<p>Lucy broke it.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Manresa, I'm going to ask you a favour&mdash;If it comes
to a pinch this afternoon, will you sing?"</p>

<p>This afternoon? Mrs. Manresa was aghast. Was it the pageant? She
had never dreamt it was this afternoon. They would never have
thrust themselves in&mdash;had they known it was this afternoon.
And, of course, once more the chime pealed. Isa heard the first
chime; and the second; and the third&mdash;If it was wet, it would
be in the Barn; if it was fine on the terrace. And which would it
be, wet or fine? And they all looked out of the window. Then the
door opened. Candish said Mr. Giles had come. Mr. Giles would be
down in a moment.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Giles had come. He had seen the great silver-plated car at the
door with the initials R. M. twisted so as to look at a distance
like a coronet. Visitors, he had concluded, as he drew up behind;
and had gone to his room to change. The ghost of convention rose to
the surface, as a blush or a tear rises to the surface at the
pressure of emotion; so the car touched his training. He must
change. And he came into the dining-room looking like a cricketer,
in flannels, wearing a blue coat with brass buttons; though he was
enraged. Had he not read, in the morning paper, in the train, that
sixteen men had been shot, others prisoned, just over there, across
the gulf, in the flat land which divided them from the continent?
Yet he changed. It was Aunt Lucy, waving her hand at him as he came
in, who made him change. He hung his grievances on her, as one
hangs a coat on a hook, instinctively. Aunt Lucy, foolish, free;
always, since he had chosen, after leaving college, to take a job
in the city, expressing her amazement, her amusement, at men who
spent their lives, buying and selling&mdash;ploughs? glass beads
was it? or stocks and shares?&mdash;to savages who wished most
oddly&mdash;for were they not beautiful naked?&mdash;to dress and
live like the English? A frivolous, a malignant statement hers was
of a problem which, for he had no special gift, no capital, and had
been furiously in love with his wife&mdash;he nodded to her across
the table&mdash;had afflicted him for ten years. Given his choice,
he would have chosen to farm. But he was not given his choice. So
one thing led to another; and the conglomeration of things pressed
you flat; held you fast, like a fish in water. So he came for the
week-end, and changed.</p>

<p>"How d'you do?" he said all round; nodded to the unknown guest;
took against him; and ate his fillet of sole.</p>

<p>He was the very type of all that Mrs. Manresa adored. His hair
curled; far from running away, as many chins did, his was firm; the
nose straight, if short; the eyes, of course, with that hair, blue;
and finally to make the type complete, there was something fierce,
untamed, in the expression which incited her, even at forty-five,
to furbish up her ancient batteries.</p>

<p>"He is my husband," Isabella thought, as they nodded across the
bunch of many-coloured flowers. "The father of my children." It
worked, that old clich&eacute;; she felt pride; and affection; then
pride again in herself, whom he had chosen. It was a shock to find,
after the morning's look in the glass, and the arrow of desire shot
through her last night by the gentleman farmer, how much she felt
when he came in, not a dapper city gent, but a cricketer, of love;
and of hate.</p>

<p>They had met first in Scotland, fishing&mdash;she from one rock,
he from another. Her line had got tangled; she had given over, and
had watched him with the stream rushing between his legs, casting,
casting&mdash;until, like a thick ingot of silver bent in the
middle, the salmon had leapt, had been caught, and she had loved
him.</p>

<p>Bartholomew too loved him; and noted his anger&mdash;about what?
But he remembered his guest. The family was not a family in the
presence of strangers. He must, rather laboriously, tell them the
story of the pictures at which the unknown guest had been looking
when Giles came in.</p>

<p>"That," he indicated the man with a horse, "was my ancestor. He
had a dog. The dog was famous. The dog has his place in history. He
left it on record that he wished his dog to be buried with
him."</p>

<p>They looked at the picture.</p>

<p>"I always feel," Lucy broke the silence, "he's saying: 'Paint my
dog.'"</p>

<p>"But what about the horse?" said Mrs. Manresa.</p>

<p>"The horse," said Bartholomew, putting on his glasses. He looked
at the horse. The hindquarters were not satisfactory.</p>

<p>But William Dodge was still looking at the lady.</p>

<p>"Ah," said Bartholomew who had bought that picture because he
liked that picture, "you're an artist."</p>

<p>Dodge denied it, for the second time in half an hour, or so Isa
noted.</p>

<p>What for did a good sort like the woman Manresa bring these
half-breeds in her trail? Giles asked himself. And his silence made
its contribution to talk&mdash;Dodge that is, shook his head. "I
like that picture." That was all he could bring himself to say.</p>

<p>"And you're right," said Bartholomew. "A man&mdash;I forget his
name&mdash;a man connected with some Institute, a man who goes
about giving advice, gratis, to descendants like ourselves,
degenerate descendants, said...said..." He paused. They all looked
at the lady. But she looked over their heads, looking at nothing.
She led them down green glades into the heart of silence.</p>

<p>"Said it was by Sir Joshua?" Mrs. Manresa broke the silence
abruptly.</p>

<p>"No, no," William Dodge said hastily, but under his breath.</p>

<p>"Why's he afraid?" Isabella asked herself. A poor specimen he
was; afraid to stick up for his own beliefs&mdash;just as she was
afraid, of her husband. Didn't she write her poetry in a book bound
like an account book lest Giles might suspect? She looked at
Giles.</p>

<p>He had finished his fish; he had eaten quickly, not to keep them
waiting. Now there was cherry tart. Mrs. Manresa was counting the
stones.</p>

<p>"Tinker, tailor, soldier, sailor, apothecary, ploughboy...
that's me!" she cried, delighted to have it confirmed by the cherry
stones that she was a wild child of nature.</p>

<p>"You believe," said the old gentleman, courteously chaffing her,
"in that too?"</p>

<p>"Of course, of course I do!" she cried. Now she was on the rails
again. Now she was a thorough good sort again. And they too were
delighted; now they could follow in her wake and leave the silver
and dun shades that led to the heart of silence.</p>

<p>"I had a father," said Dodge beneath his breath to Isa who sat
next him, "who loved pictures."</p>

<p>"Oh, I too!" she exclaimed. Flurriedly, disconnectedly, she
explained. She used to stay when she was a child, when she had the
whooping cough, with an uncle, a clergyman; who wore a skull cap;
and never did anything; didn't even preach; but made up poems,
walking in his garden, saying them aloud.</p>

<p>"People thought him mad," she said. "I didn't..."</p>

<p>She stopped.</p>

<p>"Tinker, tailor, soldier, sailor, apothecary, ploughboy... It
appears," said old Bartholomew, laying down his spoon, "that I am a
thief. Shall we take our coffee in the garden?" He rose.</p>

<p>Isa dragged her chair across the gravel, muttering: "To what
dark antre of the unvisited earth, or wind-brushed forest, shall we
go now? Or spin from star to star and dance in the maze of the
moon? Or..."</p>

<p>She held her deck chair at the wrong angle. The frame with the
notches was upside down.</p>

<p>"Songs my uncle taught me?" said William Dodge, hearing her
mutter. He unfolded the chair and fixed the bar into the right
notch.</p>

<p>She flushed, as if she had spoken in an empty room and someone
had stepped out from behind a curtain.</p>

<p>"Don't you, if you're doing something with your hands, talk
nonsense?" she stumbled. But what did he do with his hands, the
white, the fine, the shapely?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Giles went back to the house and brought more chairs and placed
them in a semi-circle, so that the view might be shared, and the
shelter of the old wall. For by some lucky chance a wall had been
built continuing the house, it might be with the intention of
adding another wing, on the raised ground in the sun. But funds
were lacking; the plan was abandoned, and the wall remained,
nothing but a wall. Later, another generation had planted fruit
trees, which in time had spread their arms widely across the red
orange weathered brick. Mrs. Sands called it a good year if she
could make six pots of apricot jam from them&mdash;the fruit was
never sweet enough for dessert. Perhaps three apricots were worth
enclosing in muslin bags. But they were so beautiful, naked, with
one flushed cheek, one green, that Mrs. Swithin left them naked,
and the wasps burrowed holes.</p>

<p>The ground sloped up, so that to quote Figgis's Guide Book
(1833), "it commanded a fine view of the surrounding country....The
spire of Bolney Minster, Rough Norton woods, and on an eminence
rather to the left, Hogben's Folly, so called because..."</p>

<p>The Guide Book still told the truth. 1833 was true in 1939. No
house had been built; no town had sprung up. Hogben's Folly was
still eminent; the very flat, field-parcelled land had changed only
in this&mdash;the tractor had to some extent superseded the plough.
The horse had gone; but the cow remained. If Figgis were here now,
Figgis would have said the same. So they always said when in summer
they sat there to drink coffee, if they had guests. When they were
alone, they said nothing. They looked at the view; they looked at
what they knew, to see if what they knew might perhaps be different
today. Most days it was the same.</p>

<p>"That's what makes a view so sad," said Mrs. Swithin, lowering
herself into the deck-chair which Giles had brought her. "And so
beautiful. It'll be there," she nodded at the strip of gauze laid
upon the distant fields, "when we're not."</p>

<p>Giles nicked his chair into position with a jerk. Thus only
could he show his irritation, his rage with old fogies who sat and
looked at views over coffee and cream when the whole of
Europe&mdash;over there&mdash;was bristling like....He had no
command of metaphor. Only the ineffective word "hedgehog"
illustrated his vision of Europe, bristling with guns, poised with
planes. At any moment guns would rake that land into furrows;
planes splinter Bolney Minster into smithereens and blast the
Folly. He, too, loved the view. And blamed Aunt Lucy, looking at
views, instead of&mdash;doing what? What she had done was to marry
a squire now dead; she had borne two children, one in Canada, the
other, married, in Birmingham. His father, whom he loved, he
exempted from censure; as for himself, one thing followed another;
and so he sat, with old fogies, looking at views.</p>

<p>"Beautiful," said Mrs. Manresa, "beautiful..." she mumbled. She
was lighting a cigarette. The breeze blew out her match. Giles
hollowed his hand and lit another. She too was exempted&mdash;why,
he could not say.</p>

<p>"Since you're interested in pictures," said Bartholomew, turning
to the silent guest, "why, tell me, are we, as a race, so
incurious, irresponsive and insensitive"&mdash;the champagne had
given him a flow of unusual three-decker words&mdash;"to that noble
art, whereas, Mrs. Manresa, if she'll allow me my old man's
liberty, has her Shakespeare by heart?"</p>

<p>"Shakespeare by heart!" Mrs. Manresa protested. She struck an
attitude. "To be, or not to be, that is the question. Whether 'tis
nobler...Go on!" she nudged Giles, who sat next her.</p>

<p>"Fade far away and quite forget what thou amongst the leaves
hast never known..." Isa supplied the first words that came into
her head by way of helping her husband out of his difficulty.</p>

<p>"The weariness, the torture, and the fret..." William Dodge
added, burying the end of his cigarette in a grave between two
stones.</p>

<p>"There!" Bartholomew exclaimed, cocking his forefinger aloft.
"That proves it! What springs touched, what secret drawer displays
its treasures, if I say"&mdash;he raised more
fingers&mdash;"Reynolds! Constable! Crome!"</p>

<p>"Why called 'Old'?" Mrs. Manresa thrust in.</p>

<p>"We haven't the words&mdash;we haven't the words," Mrs. Swithin
protested. "Behind the eyes; not on the lips; that's all."</p>

<p>"Thoughts without words," her brother mused. "Can that be?"</p>

<p>"Quite beyond me!" cried Mrs. Manresa, shaking her head. "Much
too clever! May I help myself? I know it's wrong. But I've reached
the age&mdash;and the figure&mdash;when I do what I like."</p>

<p>She took the little silver cream jug and let the smooth fluid
curl luxuriously into her coffee, to which she added a shovel full
of brown sugar candy. Sensuously, rhythmically, she stirred the
mixture round and round.</p>

<p>"Take what you like! Help yourself!" Bartholomew exclaimed. He
felt the champagne withdrawing and hastened, before the last trace
of geniality was withdrawn, to make the most of it, as if he cast
one last look into a lit-up chamber before going to bed.</p>

<p>The wild child, afloat once more on the tide of the old man's
benignity, looked over her coffee cup at Giles, with whom she felt
in conspiracy. A thread united them&mdash;visible, invisible, like
those threads, now seen, now not, that unite trembling grass blades
in autumn before the sun rises. She had met him once only, at a
cricket match. And then had been spun between them an early morning
thread before the twigs and leaves of real friendship emerge. She
looked before she drank. Looking was part of drinking. Why waste
sensation, she seemed to ask, why waste a single drop that can be
pressed out of this ripe, this melting, this adorable world? Then
she drank. And the air round her became threaded with sensation.
Bartholomew felt it; Giles felt it. Had he been a horse, the thin
brown skin would have twitched, as if a fly had settled. Isabella
twitched too. Jealousy, anger pierced her skin.</p>

<p>"And now," said Mrs. Manresa, putting down her cup, "about this
entertainment&mdash;this pageant, into which we've gone and
butted"&mdash;she made it, too, seem ripe like the apricot into
which the wasps were burrowing&mdash;"Tell me, what's it to be?"
She turned. "Don't I hear?" She listened. She heard laughter, down
among the bushes, where the terrace dipped to the bushes.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Beyond the lily pool the ground sank again, and in that dip of
the ground, bushes and brambles had mobbed themselves together. It
was always shady; sun-flecked in summer, dark and damp in winter.
In the summer there were always butterflies; fritillaries darting
through; Red Admirals feasting and floating; cabbage whites,
unambitiously fluttering round a bush, like muslin milkmaids,
content to spend a life there. Butterfly catching, for generation
after generation, began there; for Bartholomew and Lucy; for Giles;
for George it had began only the day before yesterday, when, in his
little green net, he had caught a cabbage white.</p>

<p>It was the very place for a dressing-room, just as, obviously,
the terrace was the very place for a play.</p>

<p>"The very place!" Miss La Trobe had exclaimed the first time she
came to call and was shown the grounds. It was a winter's day. The
trees were leafless then.</p>

<p>"That's the place for a pageant, Mr. Oliver!" she had exclaimed.
"Winding in and out between the trees..." She waved her hand at the
trees standing bare in the clear light of January.</p>

<p>"There the stage; here the audience; and down there among the
bushes a perfect dressing-room for the actors."</p>

<p>She was always all agog to get things up. But where did she
spring from? With that name she wasn't presumably pure English.
From the Channel Islands perhaps? Only her eyes and something about
her always made Mrs. Bingham suspect that she had Russian blood in
her. "Those deep-set eyes; that very square jaw" reminded
her&mdash;not that she had been to Russia&mdash;of the Tartars.
Rumour said that she had kept a tea shop at Winchester; that had
failed. She had been an actress. That had failed. She had bought a
four-roomed cottage and shared it with an actress. They had
quarrelled. Very little was actually known about her. Outwardly she
was swarthy, sturdy and thick set; strode about the fields in a
smock frock; sometimes with a cigarette in her mouth; often with a
whip in her hand; and used rather strong language&mdash;perhaps,
then, she wasn't altogether a lady? At any rate, she had a passion
for getting things up.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The laughter died away.</p>

<p>"Are they going to act?" Mrs. Manresa asked.</p>

<p>"Act; dance; sing; a little bit of everything," said Giles.</p>

<p>"Miss La Trobe is a lady of wonderful energy," said Mrs.
Swithin.</p>

<p>"She makes everyone do something," said Isabella.</p>

<p>"Our part," said Bartholomew, "is to be the audience. And a very
important part too."</p>

<p>"Also, we provide the tea," said Mrs. Swithin.</p>

<p>"Shan't we go and help?" said Mrs. Manresa. "Cut up bread and
butter?"</p>

<p>"No, no," said Mr. Oliver. "We are the audience."</p>

<p>"One year we had <i>Gammer Gurton's Needle,"</i> said Mrs.
Swithin. "One year we wrote the play ourselves. The son of our
blacksmith&mdash;Tony? Tommy?&mdash;had the loveliest voice. And
Elsie at the Crossways&mdash;how she mimicked! Took us all off.
Bart; Giles; Old Flimsy&mdash;that's me. People are
gifted&mdash;very. The question is&mdash;how to bring it out?
That's where she's so clever&mdash;Miss La Trobe. Of course,
there's the whole of English literature to choose from. But how can
one choose? Often on a wet day I begin counting up; what I've read;
what I haven't read."</p>

<p>"And leaving books on the floor," said her brother. "Like the
pig in the story; or was it a donkey?"</p>

<p>She laughed, tapping him lightly on the knee.</p>

<p>"The donkey who couldn't choose between hay and turnips and so
starved," Isabella explained,
interposing&mdash;anything&mdash;between her aunt and her husband,
who hated this kind of talk this afternoon. Books open; no
conclusion come to; and he sitting in the audience.</p>

<p>"We remain seated"&mdash;"We are the audience." Words this
afternoon ceased to lie flat in the sentence. They rose, became
menacing and shook their fists at you. This afternoon he wasn't
Giles Oliver come to see the villagers act their annual pageant;
manacled to a rock he was, and forced passively to behold
indescribable horror. His face showed it; and Isa, not knowing what
to say, abruptly, half purposely, knocked over a coffee cup.</p>

<p>William Dodge caught it as it fell. He held it for a moment. He
turned it. From the faint blue mark, as of crossed daggers, in the
glaze at the bottom he knew that it was English, made perhaps at
Nottingham; date about 1760. His expression, considering the
daggers, coming to this conclusion, gave Giles another peg on which
to hang his rage as one hangs a coat on a peg, conveniently. A
toady; a lickspittle; not a downright plain man of his senses; but
a teaser and twitcher; a fingerer of sensations; picking and
choosing; dillying and dallying; not a man to have straightforward
love for a woman&mdash;his head was close to Isa's head&mdash;but
simply a &mdash;&mdash; At this word, which he could not speak in
public, he pursed his lips; and the signet-ring on his little
finger looked redder, for the flesh next it whitened as he gripped
the arm of his chair.</p>

<p>"Oh what fun!" cried Mrs. Manresa in her fluty voice. "A little
bit of everything. A song; a dance; then a play acted by the
villagers themselves. Only," here she turned with her head on one
side to Isabella, "I'm sure <i>she's</i> written it. Haven't you,
Mrs. Giles?"</p>

<p>Isa flushed and denied it.</p>

<p>"For myself," Mrs. Manresa continued, "speaking plainly, I can't
put two words together. I don't know how it is&mdash;such a
chatterbox as I am with my tongue, once I hold a pen&mdash;" She
made a face, screwed her fingers as if she held a pen in them. But
the pen she held thus on the little table absolutely refused to
move.</p>

<p>"And my handwriting&mdash;so huge&mdash;so clumsy&mdash;" She
made another face and dropped the invisible pen.</p>

<p>Very delicately William Dodge set the cup in its saucer. "Now
<i>he,"</i> said Mrs. Manresa, as if referring to the delicacy with
which he did this, and imputing to him the same skill in writing,
"writes beautifully. Every letter perfectly formed."</p>

<p>Again they all looked at him. Instantly he put his hands in his
pockets.</p>

<p>Isabella guessed the word that Giles had not spoken. Well, was
it wrong if he was that word? Why judge each other? Do we know each
other? Not here, not now. But somewhere, this cloud, this crust,
this doubt, this dust&mdash;She waited for a rhyme, it failed her;
but somewhere surely one sun would shine and all, without a doubt,
would be clear.</p>

<p>She started. Again, sounds of laughter reached her.</p>

<p>"I think I hear them," she said. "They're getting ready. They're
dressing up in the bushes."</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Miss La Trobe was pacing to and fro between the leaning birch
trees. One hand was deep stuck in her jacket pocket; the other held
a foolscap sheet. She was reading what was written there. She had
the look of a commander pacing his deck. The leaning graceful trees
with black bracelets circling the silver bark were distant about a
ship's length.</p>

<p>Wet would it be, or fine? Out came the sun; and, shading her
eyes in the attitude proper to an Admiral on his quarter-deck, she
decided to risk the engagement out of doors. Doubts were over. All
stage properties, she commanded, must be moved from the Barn to the
bushes. It was done. And the actors, while she paced, taking all
responsibility and plumping for fine, not wet, dressed among the
brambles. Hence the laughter.</p>

<p>The clothes were strewn on the grass. Cardboard crowns, swords
made of silver paper, turbans that were sixpenny dish cloths, lay
on the grass or were flung on the bushes. There were pools of red
and purple in the shade; flashes of silver in the sun. The dresses
attracted the butterflies. Red and silver, blue and yellow gave off
warmth and sweetness. Red Admirals gluttonously absorbed richness
from dish cloths, cabbage whites drank icy coolness from silver
paper. Flitting, tasting, returning, they sampled the colours.</p>

<p>Miss La Trobe stopped her pacing and surveyed the scene. "It has
the makings..." she murmured. For another play always lay behind
the play she had just written. Shading her eyes, she looked. The
butterflies circling; the light changing; the children leaping; the
mothers laughing&mdash;</p>

<p>"No, I don't get it," she muttered and resumed her pacing.</p>

<p>"Bossy" they called her privately, just as they called Mrs.
Swithin "Flimsy." Her abrupt manner and stocky figure; her thick
ankles and sturdy shoes; her rapid decisions barked out in guttural
accents&mdash;all this "got their goat." No one liked to be ordered
about singly. But in little troops they appealed to her. Someone
must lead. Then too they could put the blame on her. Suppose it
poured?</p>

<p>"Miss La Trobe!" they hailed her now. "What's the idea about
this?"</p>

<p>She stopped. David and Iris each had a hand on the gramophone.
It must be hidden; yet must be close enough to the audience to be
heard. Well, hadn't she given orders? Where were the hurdles
covered in leaves? Fetch them. Mr. Streatfield had said he would
see to it. Where was Mr. Streatfield? No clergyman was visible.
Perhaps he's in the Barn? "Tommy, cut along and fetch him."
"Tommy's wanted in the first scene." "Beryl then..." The mothers
disputed. One child had been chosen; another not. Fair hair was
unjustly preferred to dark. Mrs. Ebury had forbidden Fanny to act
because of the nettle-rash. There was another name in the village
for nettle-rash.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ball's cottage was not what you might call clean. In the
last war Mrs. Ball lived with another man while her husband was in
the trenches. All this Miss La Trobe knew, but refused to be mixed
up in it. She splashed into the fine mesh like a great stone into
the lily pool. The criss-cross was shattered. Only the roots
beneath water were of use to her. Vanity, for example, made them
all malleable. The boys wanted the big parts; the girls wanted the
fine clothes. Expenses had to be kept down. Ten pounds was the
limit. Thus conventions were outraged. Swathed in conventions, they
couldn't see, as she could, that a dish cloth wound round a head in
the open looked much richer than real silk. So they squabbled; but
she kept out of it. Waiting for Mr. Streatfield, she paced between
the birch trees.</p>

<p>The other trees were magnificently straight. They were not too
regular; but regular enough to suggest columns in a church; in a
church without a roof; in an open-air cathedral, a place where
swallows darting seemed, by the regularity of the trees, to make a
pattern, dancing, like the Russians, only not to music, but to the
unheard rhythm of their own wild hearts.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The laughter died away.</p>

<p>"We must possess our souls in patience," said Mrs. Manresa
again. "Or could we help?" she suggested, glancing over her
shoulder, "with those chairs?"</p>

<p>Candish, a gardener, and a maid were all bringing
chairs&mdash;for the audience. There was nothing for the audience
to do. Mrs. Manresa suppressed a yawn. They were silent. They
stared at the view, as if something might happen in one of those
fields to relieve them of the intolerable burden of sitting silent,
doing nothing, in company. Their minds and bodies were too close,
yet not close enough. We aren't free, each one of them felt
separately to feel or think separately, nor yet to fall asleep.
We're too close; but not close enough. So they fidgeted.</p>

<p>The heat had increased. The clouds had vanished. All was sun
now. The view laid bare by the sun was flattened, silenced,
stilled. The cows were motionless; the brick wall, no longer
sheltering, beat back grains of heat. Old Mr. Oliver sighed
profoundly. His head jerked; his hand fell. It fell within an inch
of the dog's head on the grass by his side. Then up he jerked it
again on to his knee.</p>

<p>Giles glared. With his hands bound tight round his knees he
stared at the flat fields. Staring, glaring, he sat silent.</p>

<p>Isabella felt prisoned. Through the bars of the prison, through
the sleep haze that deflected them, blunt arrows bruised her; of
love, then of hate. Through other people's bodies she felt neither
love nor hate distinctly. Most consciously she felt&mdash;she had
drunk sweet wine at luncheon&mdash;a desire for water. "A beaker of
cold water, a beaker of cold water," she repeated, and saw water
surrounded by walls of shining glass.</p>

<p>Mrs. Manresa longed to relax and curl in a corner with a
cushion, a picture paper, and a bag of sweets.</p>

<p>Mrs. Swithin and William surveyed the view aloofly, and with
detachment.</p>

<p>How tempting, how very tempting, to let the view triumph; to
reflect its ripple; to let their own minds ripple; to let outlines
elongate and pitch over&mdash;so&mdash;with a sudden jerk.</p>

<p>Mrs. Manresa yielded, pitched, plunged, then pulled herself
up.</p>

<p>"What a view!" she exclaimed, pretending to dust the ashes of
her cigarette, but in truth concealing her yawn. Then she sighed,
pretending to express not her own drowsiness, but something
connected with what she felt about views.</p>

<p>Nobody answered her. The flat fields glared green yellow, blue
yellow, red yellow, then blue again. The repetition was senseless,
hideous, stupefying.</p>

<p>"Then," said Mrs. Swithin, in a low voice, as if the exact
moment for speech had come, as if she had promised, and it was time
to fulfil her promise, "come, come and I'll show you the
house."</p>

<p>She addressed no one in particular. But William Dodge knew she
meant him. He rose with a jerk, like a toy suddenly pulled straight
by a string.</p>

<p>"What energy!" Mrs. Manresa half sighed, half yawned. "Have I
the courage to go too?" Isabella asked herself. They were going;
above all things, she desired cold water, a beaker of cold water;
but desire petered out, suppressed by the leaden duty she owed to
others. She watched them go&mdash;Mrs. Swithin tottering yet
tripping; and Dodge unfurled and straightened, as he strode beside
her along the blazing tiles under the hot wall, till they reached
the shade of the house.</p>

<p>A match-box fell&mdash;Bartholomew's. His fingers had loosed it;
he had dropped it. He gave up the game; he couldn't be bothered.
With his head on one side, his hand dangling above the dog's head
he slept; he snored.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mrs. Swithin paused for a moment in the hall among the
gilt-clawed tables.</p>

<p>"This," she said, "is the staircase. And now&mdash;up we
go."</p>

<p>She went up, two stairs ahead of her guest. Lengths of yellow
satin unfurled themselves on a cracked canvas as they mounted.</p>

<p>"Not an ancestress," said Mrs. Swithin, as they came level with
the head in the picture. "But we claim her because we've known
her&mdash;O, ever so many years. Who was she?" she gazed. "Who
painted her?" She shook her head. She looked lit up, as if for a
banquet, with the sun pouring over her.</p>

<p>"But I like her best in the moonlight," Mrs. Swithin reflected,
and mounted more stairs.</p>

<p>She panted slightly, going upstairs. Then she ran her hand over
the sunk books in the wall on the landing, as if they were pan
pipes.</p>

<p>"Here are the poets from whom we descend by way of the mind,
Mr..." she murmured. She had forgotten his name. Yet she had
singled him out.</p>

<p>"My brother says, they built the house north for shelter, not
south for sun. So they're damp in the winter." She paused. "And now
what comes next?"</p>

<p>She stopped. There was a door.</p>

<p>"The morning room." She opened the door. "Where my mother
received her guests."</p>

<p>Two chairs faced each other on either side of a fine fluted
mantelpiece. He looked over her shoulder.</p>

<p>She shut the door.</p>

<p>"Now up, now up again." Again they mounted. "Up and up they
went," she panted, seeing, it seemed, an invisible procession, "up
and up to bed."</p>

<p>"A bishop; a traveller;&mdash;I've forgotten even their names. I
ignore. I forget."</p>

<p>She stopped at a window in the passage and held back the
curtain. Beneath was the garden, bathed in sun. The grass was sleek
and shining. Three white pigeons were flirting and tiptoeing as
ornate as ladies in ball dresses. Their elegant bodies swayed as
they minced with tiny steps on their little pink feet upon the
grass. Suddenly, up they rose in a flutter, circled, and flew
away.</p>

<p>"Now," she said, "for the bedrooms." She tapped twice very
distinctly on a door. With her head on one side, she listened.</p>

<p>"One never knows," she murmured, "if there's somebody there."
Then she flung open the door.</p>

<p>He half expected to see somebody there, naked, or half dressed,
or knelt in prayer. But the room was empty. The room was tidy as a
pin, not slept in for months, a spare room. Candles stood on the
dressing-table. The counterpane was straight. Mrs. Swithin stopped
by the bed.</p>

<p>"Here," she said, "yes, here," she tapped the counterpane, "I
was born. In this bed."</p>

<p>Her voice died away. She sank down on the edge of the bed. She
was tired, no doubt, by the stairs, by the heat.</p>

<p>"But we have other lives, I think, I hope," she murmured. "We
live in others, Mr....We live in things."</p>

<p>She spoke simply. She spoke with an effort. She spoke as if she
must overcome her tiredness out of charity towards a stranger, a
guest. She had forgotten his name. Twice she had said "Mr." and
stopped.</p>

<p>The furniture was mid-Victorian, bought at Maples, perhaps, in
the forties. The carpet was covered with small purple dots. And a
white circle marked the place where the slop pail had stood by the
washstand.</p>

<p>Could he say "I'm William"? He wished to. Old and frail she had
climbed the stairs. She had spoken her thoughts, ignoring, not
caring if he thought her, as he had, inconsequent, sentimental,
foolish. She had lent him a hand to help him up a steep place. She
had guessed his trouble. Sitting on the bed he heard her sing,
swinging her little legs, "Come and see my sea weeds, come and see
my sea shells, come and see my dicky bird hop upon its
perch"&mdash;an old child's nursery rhyme to help a child. Standing
by the cupboard in the corner he saw her reflected in the glass.
Cut off from their bodies, their eyes smiled, their bodiless eyes,
at their eyes in the glass.</p>

<p>Then she slipped off the bed.</p>

<p>"Now," she said, "what comes next?" and pattered down the
corridor. A door stood open. Everyone was out in the garden. The
room was like a ship deserted by its crew. The children had been
playing&mdash;there was a spotted horse in the middle of the
carpet. The nurse had been sewing&mdash;there was a piece of linen
on the table. The baby had been in the cot. The cot was empty.</p>

<p>"The nursery," said Mrs. Swithin.</p>

<p>Words raised themselves and became symbolical. "The cradle of
our race," she seemed to say.</p>

<p>Dodge crossed to the fireplace and looked at the Newfoundland
Dog in the Christmas Annual that was pinned to the wall. The room
smelt warm and sweet; of clothes drying; of milk; of biscuits and
warm water. "Good Friends" the picture was called. A rushing sound
came in through the open door. He turned. The old woman had
wandered out into the passage and leant against the window.</p>

<p>He left the door open for the crew to come back to and joined
her.</p>

<p>Down in the courtyard beneath the window cars were assembling.
Their narrow black roofs were laid together like the blocks of a
floor. Chauffeurs were jumping down; here old ladies gingerly
advanced black legs with silver-buckled shoes; old men striped
trousers. Young men in shorts leapt out on one side; girls with
skin-coloured legs on the other. There was a purring and a churning
of the yellow gravel. The audience was assembling. But they,
looking down from the window, were truants, detached. Together they
leant half out of the window.</p>

<p>And then a breeze blew and all the muslin blinds fluttered out,
as if some majestic goddess, rising from her throne among her
peers, had tossed her amber-coloured raiment, and the other gods,
seeing her rise and go, laughed, and their laughter floated her
on.</p>

<p>Mrs. Swithin put her hands to her hair, for the breeze had
ruffled it.</p>

<p>"Mr..." she began.</p>

<p>"I'm William," he interrupted.</p>

<p>At that she smiled a ravishing girl's smile, as if the wind had
warmed the wintry blue in her eyes to amber.</p>

<p>"I took you," she apologized, "away from your friends, William,
because I felt wound tight here..." She touched her bony forehead
upon which a blue vein wriggled like a blue worm. But her eyes in
their caves of bone were still lambent. He saw her eyes only. And
he wished to kneel before her, to kiss her hand, and to say: "At
school they held me under a bucket of dirty water, Mrs. Swithin;
when I looked up, the world was dirty, Mrs. Swithin; so I married;
but my child's not my child, Mrs. Swithin. I'm a half-man, Mrs.
Swithin; a flickering, mind-divided little snake in the grass, Mrs.
Swithin; as Giles saw; but you've healed me..." So he wished to
say; but said nothing; and the breeze went lolloping along the
corridors, blowing the blinds out.</p>

<p>Once more he looked and she looked down on to the yellow gravel
that made a crescent round the door. Pendant from her chain her
cross swung as she leant out and the sun struck it. How could she
weight herself down by that sleek symbol? How stamp herself, so
volatile, so vagrant, with that image? As he looked at it, they
were truants no more. The purring of the wheels became vocal.
"Hurry, hurry, hurry," it seemed to say, "or you'll be late. Hurry,
hurry, hurry, or the best seats'll be taken."</p>

<p>"O," cried Mrs. Swithin, "there's Mr. Streatfield!" And they saw
a clergyman, a strapping clergyman, carrying a hurdle, a leafy
hurdle. He was striding through the cars with the air of a person
of authority, who is awaited, expected, and now comes.</p>

<p>"Is it time," said Mrs. Swithin, "to go and join&mdash;" She
left the sentence unfinished, as if she were of two minds, and they
fluttered to right and to left, like pigeons rising from the
grass.</p>

<p>The audience was assembling. They came streaming along the paths
and spreading across the lawn. Some were old; some were in the
prime of life. There were children among them. Among them, as Mr.
Figgis might have observed, were representatives of our most
respected families&mdash;the Dyces of Denton; the Wickhams of
Owlswick; and so on. Some had been there for centuries, never
selling an acre. On the other hand there were new-comers, the
Manresas, bringing the old houses up to date, adding bathrooms. And
a scatter of odds and ends, like Cobbet of Cobbs Corner, retired,
it was understood, on a pension from a tea plantation. Not an
asset. He did his own housework and dug in his garden. The building
of a car factory and of an aerodrome in the neighbourhood had
attracted a number of unattached floating residents. Also there was
Mr. Page, the reporter, representing the local paper. Roughly
speaking, however, had Figgis been there in person and called a
roll call, half the ladies and gentlemen present would have said:
"<i>Adsum;</i> I'm here, in place of my grandfather or
great-grandfather," as the case might be. At this very moment,
half-past three on a June day in 1939 they greeted each other, and
as they took their seats, finding if possible a seat next one
another, they said: "That hideous new house at Pyes Corner! What an
eyesore! And those bungalows!&mdash;have you seen 'em?"</p>

<p>Again, had Figgis called the names of the villagers, they too
would have answered. Mrs. Sands was born Iliffe; Candish's mother
was one of the Perrys. The green mounds in the churchyard had been
cast up by their molings, which for centuries had made the earth
friable. True, there were absentees when Mr. Streatfield called his
roll call in the church. The motor bike, the motor bus, and the
movies&mdash;when Mr. Streatfield called his roll call, he laid the
blame on them.</p>

<p>Rows of chairs, deck chairs, gilt chairs, hired cane chairs, and
indigenous garden seats had been drawn up on the terrace. There
were plenty of seats for everybody. But some preferred to sit on
the ground. Certainly Miss La Trobe had spoken the truth when she
said: "The very place for a pageant!" The lawn was as flat as the
floor of a theatre. The terrace, rising, made a natural stage. The
trees barred the stage like pillars. And the human figure was seen
to great advantage against a background of sky. As for the weather,
it was turning out, against all expectation, a very fine day. A
perfect summer afternoon.</p>

<p>"What luck!" Mrs. Carter was saying. "Last year..." Then the
play began. Was it, or was it not, the play? Chuff, chuff, chuff
sounded from the bushes. It was the noise a machine makes when
something has gone wrong. Some sat down hastily, others stopped
talking guiltily. All looked at the bushes. For the stage was
empty. Chuff, chuff, chuff the machine buzzed in the bushes. While
they looked apprehensively and some finished their sentences, a
small girl, like a rosebud in pink, advanced; took her stand on a
mat, behind a conch, hung with leaves and piped:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>Gentles and simples, I address you all</i>...</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>So it was the play then. Or was it the prologue?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>Come hither for our festival</i> (she continued)<br>
<i>This is a pageant, all may see</i><br>
<i>Drawn from our island history.</i><br>
<i>England am I...</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>"She's England," they whispered. "It's begun." "The prologue,"
they added, looking down at the programme.</p>

<p><i>"England am I,"</i> she piped again; and stopped.</p>

<p>She had forgotten her lines.</p>

<p>"Hear! Hear!" said an old man in a white waistcoat briskly.
"Bravo! Bravo!"</p>

<p>"Blast 'em!" cursed Miss La Trobe, hidden behind the tree. She
looked along the front row. They glared as if they were exposed to
a frost that nipped them and fixed them all at the same level. Only
Bond the cowman looked fluid and natural.</p>

<p>"Music!" she signalled. "Music!" But the machine continued:
Chuff, chuff, chuff.</p>

<p><i>"A child new born..."</i> she prompted.</p>

<p><i>"A child new born,"</i> Phyllis Jones continued,</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>Sprung from the sea</i><br>
<i>Whose billows blown by mighty storm</i><br>
<i>Cut off from France and Germany</i><br>
<i>This isle.</i>
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>She glanced back over her shoulder. Chuff, chuff, chuff, the
machine buzzed. A long line of villagers in shirts made of sacking
began passing in and out in single file behind her between the
trees. They were singing, but not a word reached the audience.</p>

<p><i>England am I,</i> Phyllis Jones continued, facing the
audience,</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>Now weak and small</i><br>
<i>A child, as all may see</i>...</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Her words peppered the audience as with a shower of hard little
stones. Mrs. Manresa in the very centre smiled; but she felt as if
her skin cracked when she smiled. There was a vast vacancy between
her, the singing villagers and the piping child.</p>

<p>Chuff, chuff, chuff, went the machine like a corn-cutter on a
hot day.</p>

<p>The villagers were singing, but half their words were blown
away.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>Cutting the roads...up to the hill top...we climbed. Down in
the valley...sow, wild boar, hog, rhinoceros, reindeer...Dug
ourselves in to the hill top...Ground roots between stones...Ground
corn...till we too ...lay under
g&mdash;r&mdash;o&mdash;u&mdash;n&mdash;d...</i>
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The words petered away. Chuff, chuff, chuff, the machine ticked.
Then at last the machine ground out a tune!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>Armed against fate</i><br>
<i>The valiant Rhoderick</i><br>
<i>Armed and valiant</i><br>
<i>Bold and blatant</i><br>
<i>Firm elatant</i><br>
<i>See the warriors&mdash;here they come...</i>
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The pompous popular tune brayed and blared. Miss La Trobe
watched from behind the tree. Muscles loosened; ice cracked. The
stout lady in the middle began to beat time with her hand on her
chair. Mrs. Manresa was humming:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My home is at Windsor, close to the Inn.<br>
Royal George is the name of the pub.<br>
And boys you'll believe me,<br>
I don't want no asking...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>She was afloat on the stream of the melody. Radiating royalty,
complacency, good humour, the wild child was Queen of the festival.
The play had begun.</p>

<p>But there was an interruption. "O," Miss La Trobe growled behind
her tree, "the torture of these interruptions!"</p>

<p>"Sorry I'm so late," said Mrs. Swithin. She pushed her way
through the chairs to a seat beside her brother.</p>

<p>"What's it all about? I've missed the prologue. England? That
little girl? Now she's gone..."</p>

<p>Phyllis had slipped off her mat.</p>

<p>"And who's this?" asked Mrs. Swithin.</p>

<p>It was Hilda, the carpenter's daughter. She now stood where
England had stood.</p>

<p><i>"O, England's grown..."</i> Miss La Trobe prompted her.</p>

<p><i>"O, England's grown a girl now,"</i> Hilda sang out</p>

<p>("What a lovely voice!" someone exclaimed)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>With roses in her hair,</i><br>
<i>Wild roses, red roses,</i><br>
<i>She roams the lanes and chooses</i><br>
<i>A garland for her hair.</i>
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>"A cushion? Thank you so much," said Mrs. Swithin, stuffing the
cushion behind her back. Then she leant forward.</p>

<p>"That's England in the time of Chaucer, I take it. She's been
maying, nutting. She has flowers in her hair...But those passing
behind her&mdash;" she pointed. "The Canterbury pilgrims?
Look!"</p>

<p>All the time the villagers were passing in and out between the
trees. They were singing; but only a word or two was audible
"...<i>wore ruts in the grass...built the house in the lane</i>..."
The wind blew away the connecting words of their chant, and then,
as they reached the tree at the end they sang:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>"<i>To the shrine of the Saint</i>...<i>to the tomb...
lovers...believers</i>...<i>we come..."</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>They grouped themselves together.</p>

<p>Then there was a rustle and an interruption. Chairs were drawn
back. Isa looked behind her. Mr. and Mrs. Rupert Haines, detained
by a breakdown on the road, had arrived. He was sitting to the
right, several rows back, the man in grey.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the pilgrims, having done their homage to the tomb,
were, it appeared, tossing hay on their rakes,</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>I kissed a girl and let her go,</i><br>
<i>Another did I tumble,</i><br>
<i>In the straw and in the hay...</i>
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&mdash;that was what they were singing, as they scooped and
tossed the invisible hay, when she looked round again.</p>

<p>"Scenes from English history," Mrs. Manresa explained to Mrs.
Swithin. She spoke in a loud cheerful voice, as if the old lady
were deaf. "Merry England."</p>

<p>She clapped energetically.</p>

<p>The singers scampered away into the bushes. The tune stopped.
Chuff, chuff, chuff, the machine ticked. Mrs. Manresa looked at her
programme. It would take till midnight unless they skipped. Early
Briton; Plantagenets; Tudors; Stuarts&mdash;she ticked them off,
but probably she had forgotten a reign or two.</p>

<p>"Ambitious, ain't it?" she said to Bartholomew, while they
waited. Chuff, chuff, chuff went the machine. Could they talk?
Could they move? No, for the play was going on. Yet the stage was
empty; only the cows moved in the meadows; only the tick of the
gramophone needle was heard. The tick, tick, tick seemed to hold
them together, tranced. Nothing whatsoever appeared on the
stage.</p>

<p>"I'd no notion we looked so nice," Mrs. Swithin whispered to
William. Hadn't she? The children; the pilgrims; behind the
pilgrims the trees, and behind them the fields&mdash;the beauty of
the visible world took his breath away. Tick, tick, tick the
machine continued.</p>

<p>"Marking time," said old Oliver beneath his breath.</p>

<p>"Which don't exist for us," Lucy murmured. "We've only the
present."</p>

<p>"Isn't that enough?" William asked himself. Beauty&mdash;isn't
that enough? But here Isa fidgetted. Her bare brown arms went
nervously to her head. She half turned in her seat. "No, not for
us, who've the future," she seemed to say. The future disturbing
our present. Who was she looking for? William, turning, following
her eyes, saw only a man in grey.</p>

<p>The ticking stopped. A dance tune was put on the machine. In
time to it, Isa hummed: "What do I ask? To fly away, from night and
day, and issue where&mdash;no partings are&mdash;but eye meets
eye&mdash;and...O," she cried aloud: "Look at her!"</p>

<p>Everyone was clapping and laughing. From behind the bushes
issued Queen Elizabeth&mdash;Eliza Clark, licensed to sell tobacco.
Could she be Mrs. Clark of the village shop? She was splendidly
made up. Her head, pearl-hung, rose from a vast ruff. Shiny satins
draped her. Sixpenny brooches glared like cats' eyes and tigers'
eyes; pearls looked down; her cape was made of cloth of
silver&mdash;in fact swabs used to scour saucepans. She looked the
age in person. And when she mounted the soap box in the centre,
representing perhaps a rock in the ocean, her size made her appear
gigantic. She could reach a flitch of bacon or haul a tub of oil
with one sweep of her arm in the shop. For a moment she stood
there, eminent, dominant, on the soap box with the blue and sailing
clouds behind her. The breeze had risen.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>The Queen of this great land</i>...</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&mdash;those were the first words that could be heard above the
roar of laughter and applause.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>Mistress of ships and bearded men</i> (she bawled)<br>
<i>Hawkins, Frobisher, Drake,</i><br>
<i>Tumbling their oranges, ingots of silver,</i><br>
<i>Cargoes of diamonds, ducats of gold,</i><br>
<i>Down on the jetty, there in the west land,&mdash;</i><br>
(she pointed her fist at the blazing blue sky)<br>
<i>Mistress of pinnacles, spires and palaces&mdash;</i><br>
(her arm swept towards the house)<br>
<i>For me Shakespeare sang&mdash;</i><br>
(a cow mooed. A bird twittered)<br>
<i>The throstle, the mavis</i> (she continued)<br>
<i>In the green wood, the wild wood,</i><br>
<i>Carolled and sang, praising England, the Queen,</i><br>
<i>Then there was heard too</i><br>
<i>On granite and cobble</i><br>
<i>From Windsor to Oxford</i><br>
<i>Loud laughter, low laughter</i><br>
<i>Of warrior and lover,</i><br>
<i>The fighter, the singer.</i><br>
<i>The ashen haired babe</i><br>
(she stretched out her swarthy, muscular arm)<br>
<i>Stretched his arm in contentment</i><br>
<i>As home from the Isles came</i><br>
<i>The sea faring men...</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here the wind gave a tug at her head dress. Loops of pearls made
it top-heavy. She had to steady the ruffle which threatened to blow
away.</p>

<p>"Laughter, loud laughter," Giles muttered. The tune on the
gramophone reeled from side to side as if drunk with merriment.
Mrs. Manresa began beating her foot and humming in time to it.</p>

<p>"Bravo! Bravo!" she cried. "There's life in the old dog yet!"
And she trolloped out the words of the song with an abandonment
which, if vulgar, was a great help to the Elizabethan age. For the
ruff had become unpinned and great Eliza had forgotten her lines.
But the audience laughed so loud that it did not matter.</p>

<p>"I fear I am not in my perfect mind," Giles muttered to the same
tune. Words came to the surface&mdash;he remembered "a stricken
deer in whose lean flank the world's harsh scorn has struck its
thorn....Exiled from its festival, the music turned ironical...A
churchyard haunter at whom the owl hoots and the ivy mocks
tap-tap-tapping on the pane....For they are dead, and I...I...I,"
he repeated, forgetting the words, and glaring at his Aunt Lucy who
sat craned forward, her mouth gaping, and her bony little hands
clapping.</p>

<p>What were they laughing at?</p>

<p>At Albert, the village idiot, apparently. There was no need to
dress him up. There he came, acting his part to perfection. He came
ambling across the grass, mopping and mowing.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>I know where the tit nests,</i> he began<br>
<i>In the hedgerow. I know, I know&mdash;</i><br>
<i>What don't I know?</i><br>
<i>All your secrets, ladies,</i><br>
<i>And yours too, gentlemen...</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>He skipped along the front row of the audience, leering at each
in turn. Now he was picking and plucking at Great Eliza's skirts.
She cuffed him on the ear. He tweaked her back. He was enjoying
himself immensely.</p>

<p>"Albert having the time of his life," Bartholomew muttered.</p>

<p>"Hope he don't have a fit," Lucy murmured.</p>

<p><i>"I</i> <i>know...I know..."</i> Albert tittered, skipping
round the soap box.</p>

<p>"The village idiot," whispered a stout black lady&mdash;Mrs.
Elmhurst&mdash;who came from a village ten miles distant where
they, too, had an idiot. It wasn't nice. Suppose he suddenly did
something dreadful? There he was pinching the Queen's skirts. She
half covered her eyes, in case he did do&mdash;something
dreadful.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>Hoppety, jiggety,</i> Albert resumed,<br>
<i>In at the window, out at the door,</i><br>
<i>What does the little bird hear?</i> (he whistled on his
fingers.)<br>
<i>And see! There's a mouse...</i><br>
(he made as if chasing it through the grass)<br>
<i>Now the clock strikes!</i><br>
(he stood erect, puffing out his cheeks as if he were blowing a
dandelion clock)<br>
<i>One, two, three, four...</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>And off he skipped, as if his turn was over.</p>

<p>"Glad that's over." said Mrs. Elmhurst, uncovering her face.
"Now what comes next? A tableau...?"</p>

<p>For helpers, issuing swiftly from the bushes, carrying hurdles,
had enclosed the Queen's throne with screens papered to represent
walls. They had strewn the ground with rushes. And the pilgrims who
had continued their march and their chant in the background, now
gathered round the figure of Eliza on her soap box as if to form
the audience at a play.</p>

<p>Were they about to act a play in the presence of Queen
Elizabeth? Was this, perhaps, the Globe theatre?</p>

<p>"What does the programme say?" Mrs. Herbert Winthrop asked,
raising her lorgnettes.</p>

<p>She mumbled through the blurred carbon sheet. Yes; it was a
scene from a play.</p>

<p>"About a false Duke; and a Princess disguised as a boy; then the
long lost heir turns out to be the beggar, because of a mole on his
cheek; and Carinthia&mdash;that's the Duke's daughter, only she's
been lost in a cave&mdash;falls in love with Ferdinando who had
been put into a basket as a baby by an aged crone. And they marry.
That's I think what happens," she said, looking up from the
programme.</p>

<p><i>"Play out the play,"</i> great Eliza commanded. An aged crone
tottered forward.</p>

<p>("Mrs. Otter of the End House," someone murmured.)</p>

<p>She sat herself on a packing case, and made motions, plucking
her dishevelled locks and rocking herself from side to side as if
she were an aged beldame in a chimney corner.</p>

<p>("The crone, who saved the rightful heir," Mrs. Winthrop
explained.)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>'Twas a winter's night</i> (she croaked out)<br>
<i>I mind me that, I to whom all's one now, summer or
winter.</i><br>
<i>You say the sun shines? I believe you, Sir.</i><br>
<i>'Oh but it's winter, and the fog's abroad'</i><br>
<i>All's one to Elsbeth, summer or winter,</i><br>
<i>By the fireside, in the chimney corner, telling her
beads.</i><br>
<i>I've cause to tell 'em.</i><br>
<i>Each bead</i> (she held a bead between thumb and finger)<br>
<i>A crime!</i><br>
<i>'Twas a winter's night, before cockcrow,</i><br>
<i>Yet the cock did crow ere he left me&mdash;</i><br>
<i>The man with a hood on his face, and the bloody hands</i><br>
<i>And the babe in the basket.</i><br>
<i>'Tee hee' he mewed, as who should say 'I want my toy'</i><br>
<i>Poor witling!</i><br>
<i>"Tee hee, tee hee!" I could not slay him!</i><br>
<i>For that, Mary in Heaven forgive me</i><br>
<i>The sins I've sinned before cockcrow!</i><br>
<i>Down to the creek i' the dawn I slipped</i><br>
<i>Where the gull haunts and the heron stands</i><br>
<i>Like a stake on the edge of the marshes...</i><br>
<i>Who's here?</i><br>
(Three young men swaggered on to the stage and accosted her)<br>
<i>&mdash;"Are you come to torture me, Sirs?</i><br>
<i>There is little blood in this arm,</i><br>
(she extended her skinny forearm from her ragged shift)<br>
<i>Saints in Heaven preserve me!</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>She bawled. They bawled. All together they bawled, and so loud
that it was difficult to make out what they were saying: apparently
it was: <i>Did she remember concealing a child in a cradle among
the rushes some twenty years previously? A babe in a basket, crone!
A babe in a basket?</i> they bawled. <i>The wind howls and the
bittern shrieks,</i> she replied.</p>

<p>"There is little blood in my arm," Isabella repeated.</p>

<p>That was all she heard. There was such a medley of things going
on, what with the beldame's deafness, the bawling of the youths,
and the confusion of the plot that she could make nothing of
it.</p>

<p>Did the plot matter? She shifted and looked over her right
shoulder. The plot was only there to beget emotion. There were only
two emotions: love; and hate. There was no need to puzzle out the
plot. Perhaps Miss La Trobe meant that when she cut this knot in
the centre?</p>

<p>Don't bother about the plot: the plot's nothing.</p>

<p>But what was happening? The Prince had come.</p>

<p>Plucking up his sleeve, the beldame recognized the mole; and,
staggering back in her chair, shrieked:</p>

<p><i>My child! My child!</i>
</p>

<p>Recognition followed. The young Prince (Albert Perry) was almost
smothered in the withered arms of the beldame. Then suddenly he
started apart.</p>

<p><i>"Look where she comes!"</i> he cried.</p>

<p>They all looked where she came&mdash;Sylvia Edwards in white
satin.</p>

<p>Who came? Isa looked. The nightingale's song? The pearl in
night's black ear? Love embodied.</p>

<p>All arms were raised; all faces stared.</p>

<p><i>"Hail, sweet Carinthia!"</i> said the Prince, sweeping his
hat off. And she to him, raising her eyes:</p>

<p><i>"My love! My lord!"</i>
</p>

<p>"It was enough. Enough. Enough," Isa repeated.</p>

<p>All else was verbiage, repetition.</p>

<p>The beldame meanwhile, because that was enough, had sunk back on
her chair, the beads dangling from her fingers.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>"Look to the beldame there&mdash;old Elsbeth's sick!"</i><br>
(They crowded round her)<br>
<i>Dead, Sirs!</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>She fell back lifeless. The crowd drew away. Peace, let her
pass. She to whom all's one now, summer or winter.</p>

<p>Peace was the third emotion. Love. Hate. Peace. Three emotions
made the ply of human life. Now the priest, whose cotton wool
moustache confused his utterance, stepped forward and pronounced
benediction.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>From the distaff of life's tangled skein, unloose her
hands</i><br>
(They unloosed her hands)<br>
<i>Of her frailty, let nothing now remembered be.</i><br>
<i>Call for the robin redbreast and the wren.</i><br>
<i>And roses fall your crimson pall.</i><br>
(Petals were strewn from wicker baskets)<br>
<i>Cover the corpse. Sleep well.</i><br>
(They covered the corpse)<br>
<i>On you, fair Sirs</i> (he turned to the happy couple)<br>
<i>Let Heaven rain benediction!</i><br>
<i>Haste ere the envying sun</i><br>
<i>Night's curtain hath undone. Let music sound</i><br>
<i>And the free air of Heaven waft you to your slumber!</i><br>
<i>Lead on the dance!</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The gramophone blared. Dukes, priests, shepherds, pilgrims and
serving men took hands and danced. The idiot scampered in and out.
Hands joined, heads knocking, they danced round the majestic figure
of the Elizabethan age personified by Mrs. Clark, licensed to sell
tobacco, on her soap box.</p>

<p>It was a mellay; a medley; an entrancing spectacle (to William)
of dappled light and shade on half clothed, fantastically coloured,
leaping, jerking, swinging legs and arms. He clapped till his palms
stung.</p>

<p>Mrs. Manresa applauded loudly. Somehow she was the Queen; and he
(Giles) was the surly hero.</p>

<p>"Bravo! Bravo!" she cried, and her enthusiasm made the surly
hero squirm on his seat. Then the great lady in the bath chair, the
lady whose marriage with the local peer had obliterated in his
trashy title a name that had been a name when there were brambles
and briars where the Church now stood&mdash;so indigenous was she
that even her body, crippled by arthritis, resembled an uncouth,
nocturnal animal, now nearly extinct&mdash;clapped and laughed
loud&mdash;the sudden laughter of a startled jay.</p>

<p>"Ha, ha, ha!" she laughed and clutched the arms of her chair
with ungloved twisted hands.</p>

<p>"A-maying, a-maying," they bawled. "In and out and round about,
a-maying, a-maying..."</p>

<p>It didn't matter what the words were; or who sang what. Round
and round they whirled, intoxicated by the music. Then, at a sign
from Miss La Trobe behind the tree, the dance stopped. A procession
formed. Great Eliza descended from her soap box. Taking her skirts
in her hand, striding with long strides, surrounded by Dukes and
Princes, followed by the lovers arm in arm, with Albert the idiot
playing in and out, and the corpse on its bier concluding the
procession, the Elizabethan age passed from the scene.</p>

<p>"Curse! Blast! Damn 'em!" Miss La Trobe in her rage stubbed her
toe against a root. Here was her downfall; here was the Interval.
Writing this skimble-skamble stuff in her cottage, she had agreed
to cut the play here; a slave to her audience,&mdash;to Mrs. Sands'
grumble&mdash;about tea; about dinner;&mdash;she had gashed the
scene here. Just as she had brewed emotion, she spilt it. So she
signalled: Phyllis! And, summoned, Phyllis popped up on the mat
again in the middle.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>Gentles and simples, I address you all</i> (she piped.)<br>
<i>Our act is done, our scene is over.</i><br>
<i>Past is the day of crone and lover.</i><br>
<i>The bud has flowered; the flower has fallen.</i><br>
<i>But soon will rise another dawning,</i><br>
<i>For time whose children small we be</i><br>
<i>Hath in his keeping, you shall see,</i><br>
<i>You shall see...</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Her voice petered out. No one was listening. Heads bent, they
read "Interval" on the programme. And, cutting short her words, the
megaphone announced in plain English: "An interval." Half an hour's
interval, for tea. Then the gramophone blared out:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>Armed against fate,</i><br>
<i>The valiant Rhoderick,</i><br>
<i>Bold and blatant,</i><br>
<i>Firm, elatant, etc., etc.</i>
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>At that, the audience stirred. Some rose briskly; others
stooped, retrieving walking-sticks, hats, bags. And then, as they
raised themselves and turned about, the music modulated. The music
chanted: <i>Dispersed are we.</i> It moaned: <i>Dispersed are
we.</i> It lamented: <i>Dispersed are we,</i> as they streamed,
spotting the grass with colour, across the lawns, and down the
paths: <i>Dispersed are we.</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mrs. Manresa took up the strain. <i>Dispersed are we.</i>
"Freely, boldly, fearing no one" (she pushed a deck chair out of
her way). "Youths and maidens" (she glanced behind her; but Giles
had his back turned). "Follow, follow, follow me....Oh Mr. Parker,
what a pleasure to see <i>you</i> here! I'm for tea!"</p>

<p>"Dispersed are we," Isabella followed her, humming. "All is
over. The wave has broken. Left us stranded, high and dry. Single,
separate on the shingle. Broken is the three-fold ply...Now I
follow" (she pushed her chair back...The man in grey was lost in
the crowd by the ilex) "that old strumpet" (she invoked Mrs.
Manresa's tight, flowered figure in front of her) "to have
tea."</p>

<p>Dodge remained behind. "Shall I," he murmured, "go or stay? Slip
out some other way? Or follow, follow, follow the dispersing
company?"</p>

<p><i>Dispersed are we,</i> the music wailed; <i>dispersed are
we.</i> Giles remained like a stake in the tide of the flowing
company.</p>

<p>"Follow?" He kicked his chair back. "Whom? Where?" He stubbed
his light tennis shoes on the wood. "Nowhere. Anywhere." Stark
still he stood.</p>

<p>Here Cobbet of Cobbs Corner, alone under the monkey puzzle tree,
rose and muttered: "What was in her mind, eh? What idea lay behind,
eh? What made her indue the antique with this glamour&mdash;this
sham lure, and set 'em climbing, climbing, climbing up the monkey
puzzle tree?"</p>

<p><i>Dispersed are we,</i> the music wailed. <i>Dispersed are
we.</i> He turned and sauntered slowly after the retreating
company.</p>

<p>Now Lucy, retrieving her bag from beneath the seat, chirruped to
her brother:</p>

<p>"Bart, my dear, come with me....D'you remember, when we were
children, the play we acted in the nursery?"</p>

<p>He remembered. Red Indians the game was; a reed with a note
wrapped up in a pebble.</p>

<p>"But for us, my old Cindy"&mdash;he picked up his hat&mdash;"the
game's over." The glare and the stare and the beat of the tom-tom,
he meant. He gave her his arm. Off they strolled. And Mr. Page, the
reporter, noted, "Mrs. Swithin: Mr. B. Oliver," then turning, added
further "Lady Haslip, of Haslip Manor," as he spied that old lady
wheeled in her chair by her footman winding up the procession.</p>

<p>To the valediction of the gramophone hid in the bushes the
audience departed. <i>Dispersed,</i> it wailed, <i>Dispersed are
we.</i></p>

<p>Now Miss La Trobe stepped from her hiding. Flowing, and
streaming, on the grass, on the gravel, still for one moment she
held them together&mdash;the dispersing company. Hadn't she, for
twenty-five minutes, made them see? A vision imparted was relief
from agony...for one moment...one moment. Then the music petered
out on the last word <i>we.</i> She heard the breeze rustle in the
branches. She saw Giles Oliver with his back to the audience. Also
Cobbet of Cobbs Corner. She hadn't made them see. It was a failure,
another damned failure! As usual. Her vision escaped her. And
turning, she strode to the actors, undressing, down in the hollow,
where butterflies feasted upon swords of silver paper; where the
dish cloths in the shadow made pools of yellow.</p>

<p>Cobbet had out his watch. Three hours till seven, he noted; then
water the plants. He turned.</p>

<p>Giles, nicking his chair into its notch, turned too, in the
other direction. He took the short cut by the fields to the Barn.
This dry summer the path was hard as brick across the fields. This
dry summer the path was strewn with stones. He kicked&mdash;a
flinty yellow stone, a sharp stone, edged as if cut by a savage for
an arrow. A barbaric stone; a pre-historic. Stone-kicking was a
child's game. He remembered the rules. By the rules of the game,
one stone, the same stone, must be kicked to the goal. Say a gate,
or a tree. He played it alone. The gate was a goal; to be reached
in ten. The first kick was Manresa (lust). The second, Dodge
(perversion). The third himself (coward). And the fourth and the
fifth and all the others were the same.</p>

<p>He reached it in ten. There, couched in the grass, curled in an
olive green ring, was a snake. Dead? No, choked with a toad in its
mouth. The snake was unable to swallow, the toad was unable to die.
A spasm made the ribs contract; blood oozed. It was birth the wrong
way round&mdash;a monstrous inversion. So, raising his foot, he
stamped on them. The mass crushed and slithered. The white canvas
on his tennis shoes was bloodstained and sticky. But it was action.
Action relieved him. He strode to the Barn, with blood on his
shoes.</p>

<p>The Barn, the Noble Barn, the barn that had been built over
seven hundred years ago and reminded some people of a Greek temple,
others of the middle ages, most people of an age before their own,
scarcely anybody of the present moment, was empty.</p>

<p>The great doors stood open. A shaft of light like a yellow
banner sloped from roof to floor. Festoons of paper roses, left
over from the Coronation, drooped from the rafters. A long table,
on which stood an urn, plates and cups, cakes and bread and butter,
stretched across one end. The Barn was empty. Mice slid in and out
of holes or stood upright, nibbling. Swallows were busy with straw
in pockets of earth in the rafters. Countless beetles and insects
of various sorts burrowed in the dry wood. A stray bitch had made
the dark corner where the sacks stood a lying-in ground for her
puppies. All these eyes, expanding and narrowing, some adapted to
light, others to darkness, looked from different angles and edges.
Minute nibblings and rustlings broke the silence. Whiffs of
sweetness and richness veined the air. A blue-bottle had settled on
the cake and stabbed its yellow rock with its short drill. A
butterfly sunned itself sensuously on a sunlit yellow plate.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Sands was approaching. She was pushing her way through
the crowd. She had turned the corner. She could see the great open
door. But butterflies she never saw, mice were only black pellets
in kitchen drawers; moths she bundled in her hands and put out of
the window. Bitches suggested only servant girls misbehaving. Had
there been a cat she would have seen it&mdash;any cat, a starved
cat with a patch of mange on its rump opened the flood gates of her
childless heart. But there was no cat. The Barn was empty. And so
running, panting, set upon reaching the Barn and taking up her
station behind the tea urn before the company came, she reached the
Barn. And the butterfly rose and the bluebottle.</p>

<p>Following her in a scud came the servants and
helpers&mdash;David, John, Irene, Lois. Water boiled. Steam issued.
Cake was sliced. Swallows swooped from rafter to rafter. And the
company entered.</p>

<p>"This fine old Barn..." said Mrs. Manresa, stopping in the
doorway. It was not for her to press ahead of the villagers. It was
for her, moved by the beauty of the Barn, to stand still; to draw
aside; to gaze; to let other people come first.</p>

<p>"We have one, much like it, at Lathom," said Mrs. Parker,
stopping, for the same reasons. "Perhaps," she added, "not quite so
large."</p>

<p>The villagers hung back. Then, hesitating, dribbled past.</p>

<p>"And the decorations..." said Mrs. Manresa, looking round for
someone to congratulate. She stood smiling, waiting. Then old Mrs.
Swithin came in. She was gazing up too, but not at the decorations.
At the swallows apparently.</p>

<p>"They come every year," she said, "the same birds." Mrs. Manresa
smiled benevolently, humouring the old lady's whimsy. It was
unlikely, she thought, that the birds were the same.</p>

<p>"The decorations, I suppose, are left over from the Coronation,"
said Mrs. Parker. "We kept ours too. We built a village hall."</p>

<p>Mrs. Manresa laughed. She remembered. An anecdote was on the tip
of her tongue, about a public lavatory built to celebrate the same
occasion, and how the Mayor...Could she tell it? No. The old lady,
gazing at the swallows, looked too refined. "Refeened"&mdash;Mrs.
Manresa qualified the word to her own advantage, thus confirming
her approval of the wild child she was, whose nature was somehow
"just human nature." Somehow she could span the old lady's
"refeenment," also the boy's fun&mdash;Where was that nice fellow
Giles? She couldn't see him; nor Bill either. The villagers still
hung back. They must have someone to start the ball rolling.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm dying for my tea!" she said in her public voice; and
strode forward. She laid hold of a thick china mug. Mrs. Sands
giving precedence, of course, to one of the gentry, filled it at
once. David gave her cake. She was the first to drink, the first to
bite. The villagers still hung back. "It's all my eye about
democracy," she concluded. So did Mrs. Parker, taking her mug too.
The people looked to them. They led; the rest followed.</p>

<p>"What delicious tea!" each exclaimed, disgusting though it was,
like rust boiled in water, and the cake fly-blown. But they had a
duty to society.</p>

<p>"They come every year," said Mrs. Swithin, ignoring the fact
that she spoke to the empty air. "From Africa." As they had come,
she supposed, when the Barn was a swamp.</p>

<p>The Barn filled. Fumes rose. China clattered; voices chattered.
Isa pressed her way to the table.</p>

<p>"Dispersed are we," she murmured. And held her cup out to be
filled. She took it. "Let me turn away," she murmured, turning,
"from the array"&mdash;she looked desolately round her&mdash;"of
china faces, glazed and hard. Down the ride, that leads under the
nut tree and the may tree, away, till I come to the wishing well,
where the washerwoman's little boy&mdash;" she dropped sugar, two
lumps, into her tea, "dropped a pin. He got his horse, so they say.
But what wish should I drop into the well?" She looked round. She
could not see the man in grey, the gentleman farmer; nor anyone
known to her. "That the waters should cover me," she added, "of the
wishing well."</p>

<p>The noise of china and chatter drowned her murmur. "Sugar for
you?" they were saying. "Just a spot of milk? And you?" "Tea
without milk or sugar. That's the way I like it." "A bit too
strong? Let me add water."</p>

<p>"That's what I wished," Isa added, "when I dropped my pin.
Water. Water..."</p>

<p>"I must say," the voice said behind her, "it's brave of the King
and Queen. They're said to be going to India. She looks such a
dear. Someone I know said his hair..."</p>

<p>"There," Isa mused, "would the dead leaf fall, when the leaves
fall, on the water. Should I mind not again to see may tree or nut
tree? Not again to hear on the trembling spray the thrush sing, or
to see, dipping and diving as if he skimmed waves in the air, the
yellow woodpecker?"</p>

<p>She was looking at the canary yellow festoons left over from the
Coronation.</p>

<p>"I thought they said Canada, not India," the voice said behind
her back. To which the other voice answered: "D'you believe what
the papers say? For instance, about the Duke of Windsor. He landed
on the south coast. Queen Mary met him. She'd been buying
furniture&mdash;that's a fact. And the papers say she met
him..."</p>

<p>"Alone, under a tree, the withered tree that keeps all day,
murmuring of the sea, and hears the Rider gallop..."</p>

<p>Isa filled in the phrase. Then she started. William Dodge was by
her side.</p>

<p>He smiled. She smiled. They were conspirators; each murmuring
some song my uncle taught me.</p>

<p>"It's the play," she said. "The play keeps running in my
head."</p>

<p>"Hail, sweet Carinthia. My love. My life," he quoted.</p>

<p>"My lord, my liege," she bowed ironically.</p>

<p>She was handsome. He wanted to see her, not against the tea urn,
but with her glass green eyes and thick body, the neck was broad as
a pillar, against an arum lily or a vine. He wished she would say:
"Come along. I'll show you the greenhouse, the pig sty, or the
stable." But she said nothing, and they stood there holding their
cups, remembering the play. Then he saw her face change, as if she
had got out of one dress and put on another. A small boy battled
his way through the crowd, striking against skirts and trousers as
if he were swimming blindly.</p>

<p>"Here!" she cried raising her arm.</p>

<p>He made a bee-line for her. He was her little boy, apparently,
her son, her George. She gave him cake; then a mug of milk. Then
Nurse came up. Then again she changed her dress. This time, from
the expression in her eyes it was apparently something in the
nature of a strait waistcoat. Hirsute, handsome, virile, the young
man in blue jacket and brass buttons, standing in a beam of dusty
light, was her husband. And she his wife. Their relations, as he
had noted at lunch, were as people say in novels "strained." As he
had noted at the play, her bare arm had raised itself nervously to
her shoulder when she turned&mdash;looking for whom? But here he
was; and the muscular, the hirsute, the virile plunged him into
emotions in which the mind had no share. He forgot how she would
have looked against vine leaf in a greenhouse. Only at Giles he
looked; and looked and looked. Of whom was he thinking as he stood
with his face turned? Not of Isa. Of Mrs. Manresa?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mrs. Manresa half-way down the Barn had gulped her cup of tea.
How can I rid myself, she asked, of Mrs. Parker? If they were of
her own class, how they bored her&mdash;her own sex! Not the class
below&mdash;cooks, shopkeepers, farmers' wives; nor the class
above&mdash;peeresses, countesses; it was the women of her own
class that bored her. So she left Mrs. Parker, abruptly.</p>

<p>"Oh Mrs. Moore," she hailed the keeper's wife. "What did you
think of it? And what did baby think of it?" Here she pinched baby.
"I thought it every bit as good as anything I'd seen in
London....But we mustn't be outdone. We'll have a play of our own.
In <i>our</i> Barn. We'll show 'em" (here she winked obliquely at
the table; so many bought cakes, so few made at home) "how
<i>we</i> do it."</p>

<p>Then cracking her jokes, she turned; saw Giles; caught his eye;
and swept him in, beckoning. He came. And what&mdash;she looked
down&mdash;had he done with his shoes? They were bloodstained.
Vaguely some sense that he had proved his valour for her admiration
flattered her. If vague it was sweet. Taking him in tow, she felt:
I am the Queen, he my hero, my sulky hero.</p>

<p>"That's Mrs. Neale!" she exclaimed. "A perfect marvel of a
woman, aren't you, Mrs. Neale! She runs our post office, Mrs.
Neale. She can do sums in her head, can't you, Mrs. Neale?
Twenty-five halfpenny stamps, two packets of stamped envelopes and
a packet of postcards&mdash;how much does that come to, Mrs.
Neale?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Neale laughed; Mrs. Manresa laughed; Giles too smiled, and
looked down at his shoes.</p>

<p>She drew him down the Barn, in and out, from one to another. She
knew 'em all. Every one was a thorough good sort. No, she wouldn't
allow it, not for a moment&mdash;Pinsent's bad leg. "No, no. We're
not going to take that for an excuse, Pinsent." If he couldn't
bowl, he could bat. Giles agreed. A fish on a line meant the same
to him and Pinsent; also jays and magpies. Pinsent stayed on the
land; Giles went to an office. That was all. And she was a thorough
good sort, making him feel less of an audience, more of an actor,
going round the Barn in her wake.</p>

<p>Then, at the end by the door, they came upon the old couple,
Lucy and Bartholomew, sitting on their Windsor chairs.</p>

<p>Chairs had been reserved for them. Mrs. Sands had sent them tea.
It would have caused more bother than it was worth&mdash;asserting
the democratic principle; standing in the crowd at the table.</p>

<p>"Swallows," said Lucy, holding her cup, looking at the birds.
Excited by the company they were flitting from rafter to rafter.
Across Africa, across France they had come to nest here. Year after
year they came. Before there was a channel, when the earth, upon
which the Windsor chair was planted, was a riot of rhododendrons,
and humming birds quivered at the mouths of scarlet trumpets, as
she had read that morning in her Outline of History, they had
come...Here Bart rose from his chair.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Manresa absolutely refused to take his seat. "Go on
sitting, go on sitting," she pressed him down again. "I'll squat on
the floor." She squatted. The surly knight remained in
attendance.</p>

<p>"And what did you think of the play?" she asked.</p>

<p>Bartholomew looked at his son. His son remained silent.</p>

<p>"And you Mrs. Swithin?" Mrs. Manresa pressed the old lady.</p>

<p>Lucy mumbled, looking at the swallows.</p>

<p>"I was hoping you'd tell me," said Mrs. Manresa. "Was it an old
play? Was it a new play?"</p>

<p>No one answered.</p>

<p>"Look!" Lucy exclaimed.</p>

<p>"The birds?" said Mrs. Manresa, looking up.</p>

<p>There was a bird with a straw in its beak; and the straw
dropped.</p>

<p>Lucy clapped her hands. Giles turned away. She was mocking him
as usual, laughing.</p>

<p>"Going?" said Bartholomew. "Time for the next act?"</p>

<p>And he heaved himself up from his chair. Regardless of Mrs.
Manresa and of Lucy, off he strolled too.</p>

<p>"Swallow, my sister, O sister swallow," he muttered, feeling for
his cigar case, following his son.</p>

<p>Mrs. Manresa was nettled. What for had she squatted on the floor
then? Were her charms fading? Both were gone. But, woman of action
as she was, deserted by the male sex, she was not going to suffer
tortures of boredom from the refeened old lady. Up she scrambled,
putting her hands to hair as if it were high time that she went
too, though it was nothing of the kind and her hair was perfectly
tidy. Cobbet in his corner saw through her little game. He had
known human nature in the East. It was the same in the West. Plants
remained&mdash;the carnation, the zinnia, and the geranium.
Automatically he consulted his watch; noted time to water at seven;
and observed the little game of the woman following the man to the
table in the West as in the East.</p>

<p>William at the table, now attached to Mrs. Parker and Isa,
watched him approach. Armed and valiant, bold and blatant, firm
elatant&mdash;the popular march tune rang in his head. And the
fingers of William's left hand closed firmly, surreptitiously, as
the hero approached.</p>

<p>Mrs. Parker was deploring to Isa in a low voice the village
idiot.</p>

<p>"Oh that idiot!" she was saying. But Isa was immobile, watching
her husband. She could feel the Manresa in his wake. She could hear
in the dusk in their bedroom the usual explanation. It made no
difference; his infidelity&mdash;but hers did.</p>

<p>"The idiot?" William answered Mrs. Parker for her. "He's in the
tradition."</p>

<p>"But surely," said Mrs. Parker, and told Giles how creepy the
idiot&mdash;"We have one in our village"&mdash;had made her feel.
"Surely, Mr. Oliver, we're more civilized?"</p>

<p><i>"We?</i>" said Giles. <i>"We?"</i> He looked, once, at
William. He knew not his name; but what his left hand was doing. It
was a bit of luck&mdash;that he could despise him, not himself.
Also Mrs. Parker. But not Isa&mdash;not his wife. She had not
spoken to him, not one word. Nor looked at him either.</p>

<p>"Surely," said Mrs. Parker, looking from one to the other.
"Surely we are?"</p>

<p>Giles then did what to Isa was his little trick; shut his lips;
frowned; and took up the pose of one who bears the burden of the
world's woe, making money for her to spend.</p>

<p>"No," said Isa, as plainly as words could say it. "I don't
admire you," and looked, not at his face, but at his feet. "Silly
little boy, with blood on his boots."</p>

<p>Giles shifted his feet. Whom then did she admire? Not Dodge.
That he could take for certain. Who else? Some man he knew. Some
man, he was sure, in the Barn. Which man? He looked round him.</p>

<p>Then Mr. Streatfield, the clergyman, interrupted. He was
carrying cups.</p>

<p>"So I shake hands with my heart!" he exclaimed, nodding his
handsome, grizzled head and depositing his burden safely.</p>

<p>Mrs. Parker took the tribute to herself.</p>

<p>"Mr. Streatfield!" she exclaimed. "Doing all the work! While we
stand gossiping!"</p>

<p>"Like to see the greenhouse?" said Isa suddenly, turning to
William Dodge.</p>

<p>O not now, he could have cried. But had to follow, leaving Giles
to welcome the approaching Manresa, who had him in thrall.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The path was narrow. Isa went ahead. And she was broad; she
fairly filled the path, swaying slightly as she walked, and
plucking a leaf here and there from the hedge.</p>

<p>"Fly then, follow," she hummed, "the dappled herds in the cedar
grove, who, sporting, play, the red with the roe, the stag with the
doe. Fly, away. I grieving stay. Alone I linger, I pluck the bitter
herb by the ruined wall, the churchyard wall, and press its sour,
its sweet, its sour, long grey leaf, so, twixt thumb and
finger..."</p>

<p>She threw away the shred of Old Man's Beard that she had picked
in passing and kicked open the greenhouse door. Dodge had lagged
behind. She waited. She picked up a knife from the plank. He saw
her standing against the green glass, the fig tree, and the blue
hydrangea, knife in hand.</p>

<p>"She spake," Isa murmured. "And from her bosom's snowy antre
drew the gleaming blade. 'Plunge blade!' she said. And struck.
'Faithless!' she cried. Knife, too! It broke. So too my heart," she
said.</p>

<p>She was smiling ironically as he came up.</p>

<p>"I wish the play didn't run in my head," she said. Then she sat
down on a plank under the vine. And he sat beside her. The little
grapes above them were green buds; the leaves thin and yellow as
the web between birds' claws.</p>

<p>"Still the play?" he asked. She nodded. "That was your son," he
said, "in the Barn?"</p>

<p>She had a daughter too, she told him, in the cradle.</p>

<p>"And you&mdash;married?" she asked. From her tone he knew she
guessed, as women always guessed, everything. They knew at once
they had nothing to fear, nothing to hope. At first they
resented&mdash;serving as statues in a greenhouse. Then they liked
it. For then they could say&mdash;as she did&mdash;whatever came
into their heads. And hand him, as she handed him, a flower.</p>

<p>"There's something for your buttonhole, Mr..." she said, handing
him a sprig of scented geranium.</p>

<p>"I'm William," he said, taking the furry leaf and pressing it
between thumb and finger.</p>

<p>"I'm Isa," she answered. Then they talked as if they had known
each other all their lives; which was odd, she said, as they always
did, considering she'd known him perhaps one hour. Weren't they,
though, conspirators, seekers after hidden faces? That confessed,
she paused and wondered, as they always did, why they could speak
so plainly to each other. And added: "Perhaps because we've never
met before, and never shall again."</p>

<p>"The doom of sudden death hanging over us," he said. "There's no
retreating and advancing"&mdash;he was thinking of the old lady
showing him the house&mdash;"for us as for them."</p>

<p>The future shadowed their present, like the sun coming through
the many-veined transparent vine leaf; a criss-cross of lines
making no pattern.</p>

<p>They had left the greenhouse door open, and now music came
through it. A.B.C., A.B.C., A.B.C.&mdash;someone was practising
scales. C.A.T. C.A.T. C.A.T....Then the separate letters made one
word "Cat." Other words followed. It was a simple tune, like a
nursery rhyme&mdash;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The King is in his counting house,<br>
Counting out his money,<br>
The Queen is in her parlour<br>
Eating bread and honey.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>They listened. Another voice, a third voice, was saying
something simple. And they sat on in the greenhouse, on the plank
with the vine over them, listening to Miss La Trobe or whoever it
was, practising her scales.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>He could not find his son. He had lost him in the crowd. So old
Bartholomew left the Barn, and went to his own room, holding his
cheroot and murmuring:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"O sister swallow, O sister swallow,<br>
How can thy heart be full of the spring?"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>"How can my heart be full of the spring?" he said aloud,
standing in front of the book case. Books: the treasured life-blood
of immortal spirits. Poets; the legislators of mankind. Doubtless,
it was so. But Giles was unhappy. "How can my heart, how can my
heart," he repeated, puffing at his cheroot. "Condemned in life's
infernal mine, condemned in solitude to pine..." Arms akimbo, he
stood in front of his country gentleman's library. Garibaldi;
Wellington; Irrigation Officers' Reports; and Hibbert on the
Diseases of the Horse. A great harvest the mind had reaped; but for
all this, compared with his son, he did not care one damn.</p>

<p>"What's the use, what's the use," he sank down into his chair
muttering, "O sister swallow, O sister swallow, of singing your
song?" The dog, who had followed him, flopped down on to the floor
at his feet. Flanks sucked in and out, the long nose resting on his
paws, a fleck of foam on the nostril, there he was, his familiar
spirit, his Afghan hound.</p>

<p>The door trembled and stood half open. That was Lucy's way of
coming in&mdash;as if she did not know what she would find. Really!
It was her brother! And his dog! She seemed to see them for the
first time. Was it that she had no body? Up in the clouds, like an
air ball, her mind touched ground now and then with a shock of
surprise. There was nothing in her to weight a man like Giles to
the earth.</p>

<p>She perched on the edge of a chair like a bird on a telegraph
wire before starting for Africa.</p>

<p>"Swallow, my sister, O sister swallow..." he murmured.</p>

<p>From the garden&mdash;the window was open&mdash;came the sound
of someone practising scales. A.B.C. A.B.C. A.B.C. Then the
separate letters formed one word "Dog." Then a phrase. It was a
simple tune, another voice speaking.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Hark hark, the dogs do bark<br>
The beggars are coming to town..."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Then it languished and lengthened, and became a waltz. As they
listened and looked&mdash;out into the garden&mdash;the trees
tossing and the birds swirling seemed called out of their private
lives, out of their separate avocations, and made to take part.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The lamp of love burns high, over the dark cedar groves,<br>
The lamp of love shines clear, clear as a star in the sky...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Old Bartholomew tapped his fingers on his knee in time to the
tune.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Leave your casement and come, lady, I love till I die,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>He looked sardonically at Lucy, perched on her chair. How, he
wondered, had she ever borne children?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For all are dancing, retreating and advancing,<br>
The moth and the dragon fly...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>She was thinking, he supposed, God is peace. God is love. For
she belonged to the unifiers; he to the separatists.</p>

<p>Then the tune with its feet always on the same spot, became
sugared, insipid; bored a hole with its perpetual invocation to
perpetual adoration. Had it&mdash;he was ignorant of musical
terms&mdash;gone into the minor key?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For this day and this dance and this merry, merry May<br>
Will be over (he tapped his forefinger on his knee)<br>
With the cutting of the clover this retreating and
advancing&mdash;the swifts seemed to have shot beyond their
orbits&mdash;<br>
Will be over, over, over,<br>
And the ice will dart its splinter, and the winter,<br>
O the winter, will fill the grate with ashes,<br>
And there'll be no glow, no glow on the log.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>He knocked the ash off his cheroot and rose.</p>

<p>"So we must," said Lucy; as if he had said aloud, "It's time to
go."</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The audience was assembling. The music was summoning them. Down
the paths, across the lawns they were streaming again. There was
Mrs. Manresa, with Giles at her side, heading the procession. In
taut plump curves her scarf blew round her shoulders. The breeze
was rising. She looked, as she crossed the lawn to the strains of
the gramophone, goddess-like, buoyant, abundant, her cornucopia
running over. Bartholomew, following, blessed the power of the
human body to make the earth fruitful. Giles would keep his orbit
so long as she weighted him to the earth. She stirred the stagnant
pool of his old heart even&mdash;where bones lay buried, but the
dragon flies shot and the grass trembled as Mrs. Manresa advanced
across the lawn to the strains of the gramophone.</p>

<p>Feet crunched the gravel. Voices chattered. The inner voice, the
other voice was saying: How can we deny that this brave music,
wafted from the bushes, is expressive of some inner harmony? "When
we wake" (some were thinking) "the day breaks us with its hard
mallet blows." "The office" (some were thinking) "compels
disparity. Scattered, shattered, hither thither summoned by the
bell. 'Ping-ping-ping' that's the phone. 'Forward!'
'Serving!'&mdash;that's the shop." So we answer to the infernal,
agelong and eternal order issued from on high. And obey. "Working,
serving, pushing, striving, earning wages&mdash;to be
spent&mdash;here? Oh dear no. Now? No, by and by. When ears are
deaf and the heart is dry."</p>

<p>Here Cobbet of Cobbs Corner who had stooped&mdash;there was a
flower&mdash;was pressed on by people pushing from behind.</p>

<p>For I hear music, they were saying. Music wakes us. Music makes
us see the hidden, join the broken. Look and listen. See the
flowers, how they ray their redness, whiteness, silverness and
blue. And the trees with their many-tongued much syllabling, their
green and yellow leaves hustle us and shuffle us, and bid us, like
the starlings, and the rooks, come together, crowd together, to
chatter and make merry while the red cow moves forward and the
black cow stands still.</p>

<p>The audience had reached their seats. Some sat down; others
stood a moment, turned, and looked at the view. The stage was
empty; the actors were still dressing up among the bushes. The
audience turned to one another and began to talk. Scraps and
fragments reached Miss La Trobe where she stood, script in hand,
behind the tree.</p>

<p>"They're not ready...I hear 'em laughing" (they were saying.)
"...Dressing up. That's the great thing, dressing up. And it's
pleasant now, the sun's not so hot...That's one good the war
brought us&mdash;longer days...Where did we leave off? D'you
remember? The Elizabethans...Perhaps she'll reach the present, if
she skips....D'you think people change? Their clothes, of
course....But I meant ourselves...Clearing out a cupboard, I found
my father's old top hat....But ourselves&mdash;do we change?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't go by politicians. I've a friend who's been to
Russia. He says...And my daughter, just back from Rome, she says
the common people, in the caf&eacute;'s, hate Dictators...Well,
different people say different things..."</p>

<p>"Did you see it in the papers&mdash;the case about the dog?
D'you believe dogs can't have puppies?...And Queen Mary and the
Duke of Windsor on the south coast?...D'you believe what's in the
papers? I ask the butcher or the grocer...That's Mr. Streatfield,
carrying a hurdle....The good clergyman, I say, does more work for
less pay than all the lot...It's the wives that make the
trouble..."</p>

<p>"And what about the Jews? The refugees...the Jews...People like
ourselves, beginning life again...But it's always been the
same....My old mother, who's over eighty, can remember...Yes, she
still reads without glasses....How amazing! Well, don't they say,
after eighty...Now they're coming...No, that's nothing....I'd make
it penal, leaving litter. But then, who's, my husband says, to
collect the fines?...Ah there she is, Miss La Trobe, over there,
behind that tree..."</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Over there behind the tree Miss La Trobe gnashed her teeth. She
crushed her manuscript. The actors delayed. Every moment the
audience slipped the noose; split up into scraps and fragments.</p>

<p>"Music!" she signalled. "Music!"</p>

<p>"What's the origin," said a voice, "of the expression 'with a
flea in his ear'?"</p>

<p>Down came her hand peremptorily. "Music, music," she
signalled.</p>

<p>And the gramophone began A.B.C., A.B.C.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>The King is in his counting house</i><br>
<i>Counting out his money,</i><br>
<i>The Queen is in her parlour</i><br>
<i>Eating bread and honey...</i>
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Miss La Trobe watched them sink down peacefully into the nursery
rhyme. She watched them fold their hands and compose their faces.
Then she beckoned. And at last, with a final touch to her head
dress, which had been giving trouble, Mabel Hopkins strode from the
bushes, and took her place on the raised ground facing the
audience.</p>

<p>Eyes fed on her as fish rise to a crumb of bread on the water.
Who was she? What did she represent? She was beautiful&mdash;very.
Her cheeks had been powdered; her colour glowed smooth and clear
underneath. Her grey satin robe (a bedspread), pinned in stone-like
folds, gave her the majesty of a statue. She carried a sceptre and
a little round orb. England was she? Queen Anne was she? Who was
she? She spoke too low at first; all they heard was</p>

<p>...<i>reason holds sway.</i></p>

<p>Old Bartholomew applauded.</p>

<p>"Hear! Hear!" he cried." Bravo! Bravo!"</p>

<p>Thus encouraged Reason spoke out.</p>

<p><i>Time, leaning on his sickle, stands amazed. While commerce
from her Cornucopia pours the mingled tribute of her different
ores. In distant mines the savage sweats; and from the reluctant
earth the painted pot is shaped. At my behest</i>, <i>the armed
warrior lays his shield aside; the heathen leaves the Altar
steaming with unholy sacrifice. The violet and the eglantine over
the riven earth their flowers entwine. No longer fears the unwary
wanderer the poisoned snake. And in the helmet, yellow bees their
honey make.</i></p>

<p>She paused. A long line of villagers in sacking were passing in
and out of the trees behind her.</p>

<p><i>Digging and delving, ploughing and sowing</i> they were
singing, but the wind blew their words away.</p>

<p><i>Beneath the shelter of my flowing robe</i> (she resumed,
extending her arms) <i>the arts arise. Music for me unfolds her
heavenly harmony. At my behest the miser leaves his hoard
untouched; at peace the mother sees her children play....Her
children play...</i> she repeated, and, waving her sceptre, figures
advanced from the bushes.</p>

<p><i>Let swains and nymphs lead on the play, while Zephyr sleeps,
and the unruly tribes of Heaven confess my sway.</i>
</p>

<p>A merry little old tune was played on the gramophone. Old
Bartholomew joined his finger tips; Mrs. Manresa smoothed her
skirts about her knees.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>Young Damon said to Cynthia</i><br>
<i>Come out now with the dawn</i><br>
<i>And don your azure tippet</i><br>
<i>And cast your cares adown</i><br>
<i>For peace has come to England,</i><br>
<i>And reason now holds sway.</i><br>
<i>What pleasure lies in dreaming</i><br>
<i>When blue and green's the day?</i><br>
<i>Now cast your cares behind you.</i><br>
<i>Night passes: here is Day.</i>
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>Digging and delving,</i> the villagers sang passing in single
file in and out between the trees, <i>for the earth is always the
same, summer and winter and spring; and spring and winter again;
ploughing and sowing, eating and growing; time passes...</i></p>

<p>The wind blew the words away.</p>

<p>The dance stopped. The nymphs and swains withdrew. Reason held
the centre of the stage alone. Her arms extended, her robes
flowing, holding orb and sceptre, Mabel Hopkins stood sublimely
looking over the heads of the audience. The audience gazed at her.
She ignored the audience. Then while she gazed, helpers from the
bushes arranged round her what appeared to be the three sides of a
room. In the middle they stood a table. On the table they placed a
china tea service. Reason surveyed this domestic scene from her
lofty eminence unmoved. There was a pause.</p>

<p>"Another scene from another play, I suppose," said Mrs.
Elmhurst, referring to her programme. She read out for the benefit
of her husband, who was deaf: <i>"Where there's a Will there's a
Way.</i> That's the name of the play. And the characters..." She
read out: "Lady Harpy Harraden, in love with Sir Spaniel Lilyliver.
Deb, her maid. Flavinda, her niece, in love with Valentine. Sir
Spaniel Lilyliver, in love with Flavinda. Sir Smirking
Peace-be-with-you-all, a clergyman. Lord and Lady Fribble.
Valentine, in love with Flavinda. What names for real people! But
look&mdash;here they come!"</p>

<p>Out they came from the bushes&mdash;men in flowered waistcoats,
white waistcoats and buckled shoes; women wearing brocades tucked
up, hooped and draped; glass stars, blue ribands and imitation
pearls made them look the very image of Lords and Ladies.</p>

<p>"The first scene," Mrs. Elmhurst whispered into her husband's
ear, "is Lady Harraden's dressing-room....That's her..." She
pointed. "Mrs. Otter, I think, from the End House; but she's
wonderfully made up. And that's Deb her maid. Who she is, I don't
know."</p>

<p>"Hush, hush, hush," someone protested.</p>

<p>Mrs. Elmhurst dropped her programme. The play had begun.</p>

<p>Lady Harpy Harraden entered her dressing-room, followed by Deb
her maid.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>LADY H. H....<i>Give me the pounce-box. Then the patch. Hand me
the mirror, girl. So. Now my wig....A pox on the girl&mdash;she's
dreaming!</i></p>

<p>DEB <i>...I was thinking, my lady, what the gentleman said when
he saw you in the Park.</i></p>

<p>LADY H. H. (gazing in the glass) <i>So, so&mdash;what was it?
Some silly trash! Cupid's dart&mdash;hah, hah! lighting his
taper&mdash;tush&mdash;at my eyes....pooh! That was in milord's
time, twenty years since....But now&mdash;what'll he say of me
now?</i> (She looks in the mirror) <i>Sir Spaniel Lilyliver, I
mean</i>...(a rap at the door) <i>Hark! That's his chaise at the
door. Run child. Don't stand gaping.</i></p>

<p>DEB...(going to the door) <i>Say? He'll rattle his tongue as a
gambler rattles dice in a box. He'll find no words to fit you.
He'll stand like a pig in a poke....Your servant, Sir
Spaniel.</i></p>

<p>Enter Sir Spaniel.</p>

<p>SIR S. L....<i>Hail, my fair Saint! What, out o' bed so early?
Methought, as I came along the Mall the air was something brighter
than usual. Here's the reason....Venus, Aphrodite, upon my word a
very galaxy, a constellation! As I'm a sinner, a very Aurora
Borealis!</i></p>

<p>(He sweeps his hat off.)</p>

<p>LADY H. H. <i>Oh flatterer, flatterer! I know your ways. But
come. Sit down....A glass of Aqua Vitae. Take this seat, Sir
Spaniel. I've something very private and particular to say to
you....You had my letter, Sir?</i></p>

<p>SIR S. L....<i>Pinned to my heart!</i></p>

<p>(He strikes his breast.)</p>

<p>LADY H. H....<i>I have a favour to ask of you, Sir.</i></p>

<p>SIR S. L....(singing) <i>What favour could fair Chloe ask that
Damon would not get her?...A done with rhymes. Rhymes are
still-a-bed. Let's speak prose. What can Asphodilla ask of her
plain servant Lilyliver? Speak out, Madam. An ape with a ring in
his nose, or a strong young jackanapes to tell tales of us when
we're no longer here to tell truth about ourselves?</i></p>

<p>LADY H. H. (flirting her fan) <i>Fie, fie, Sir Spaniel. You make
me blush&mdash;you do indeed. But come closer.</i> (She shifts her
seat nearer to him) <i>We don't want the whole world to hear
us.</i></p>

<p>SIR S. L. (aside) <i>Come closer? A pox on my life! The old hag
stinks like a red herring that's been stood over head in a tar
barrel!</i> (Aloud) <i>Your meaning, Madam? You were
saying?</i></p>

<p>LADY H. H. <i>I</i> <i>have a niece, Sir Spaniel, Flavinda by
name.</i></p>

<p>SIR S. L. (aside) <i>Why that's the girl I love, to be sure!</i>
(Aloud) <i>You have a niece, madam? I seem to remember hearing so.
An only child, left by your brother, so I've heard, in your
Ladyship's charge&mdash;him that perished at sea.</i></p>

<p>LADY H. H. <i>The very same Sir. She's of age now and
marriageable. I've kept her close as a weevil, Sir Spaniel, wrapped
in the sere cloths of her virginity. Only maids about her, never a
man to my knowledge, save Clout the serving man, who has a wart on
his nose and a face like a nutgrater. Yet some fool has caught her
fancy. Some gilded fly&mdash;some Harry, Dick; call him what you
will.</i></p>

<p>SIR S. L. (aside) <i>That's young Valentine, I warrant. I caught
'em at the play together.</i> (Aloud) <i>Say you so, Madam?</i></p>

<p>LADY H. H. <i>She's not so ill favoured, Sir
Spaniel&mdash;there's beauty in our line&mdash;but that a gentleman
of taste and breeding like yourself now might take pity on
her.</i></p>

<p>SIR S. L. <i>Saving your presence, Madam. Eyes that have seen
the sun are not so easily dazzled by the lesser lights&mdash;the
Cassiopeias, Aldebarans, Great Bears and so on&mdash;A fig for them
when the sun's up!</i></p>

<p>LADY H. H. (ogling him) <i>You praise my hair-dresser, Sir, or
my ear-rings</i> (she shakes her head).</p>

<p>SIR S. L. (aside) <i>She jingles like a she-ass at a fair! She's
rigged like a barber's pole of a May Day.</i> (Aloud) <i>Your
commands, Madam?</i></p>

<p>LADY H. H. <i>Well Sir, t'was this way Sir. Brother Bob, for my
father was a plain country gentleman and would have none of the
fancy names the foreigners brought with 'em&mdash;Asphodilla I call
myself, but my Christian name's plain Sue&mdash;Brother Bob, as I
was telling you, ran away to sea; and, so they say, became Emperor
of the Indies; where the very stones are emeralds and the
sheep-crop rubies. Which, for a tenderer-hearted man never lived,
he would have brought back with him, Sir, to mend the family
fortunes, Sir. But the brig, frigate or what they call it, for I've
no head for sea terms, never crossed a ditch without saying the
Lord's Prayer backwards, struck a rock. The Whale had him. But the
cradle was by the bounty of Heaven washed ashore. With the girl in
it; Flavinda here. What's more to the point, with the Will in it;
safe and sound; wrapped in parchment. Brother Bob's Will. Deb
there! Deb I say! Deb!</i></p>

<p>(She hollas for Deb)</p>

<p>SIR S. L. (aside) <i>Ah hah! I smell a rat! A will, quotha!
Where there's a Will there's a Way.</i></p>

<p>LADY H. H. (bawling) <i>The Will, Deb! The Will! In the ebony
box by the right hand of the escritoire opposite the window...A pox
on the girl! She's dreaming. It's these romances, Sir
Spaniel&mdash;these romances. Can't see a candle gutter but its her
heart that's melting, or snuff a wick without reciting all the
names in Cupid's Calendar</i>...</p>

<p>(Enter Deb carrying a parchment)</p>

<p>LADY H. H. <i>So...Give it here. The Will. Brother Bob's
Will</i> (she mumbles over the Will).</p>

<p>LADY H. H. <i>To cut the matter short, Sir, for these lawyers
even at the Antipodes are a long-winded race&mdash;</i></p>

<p>SIR S. L. <i>To match their ears, Ma'am&mdash;</i></p>

<p>LADY H. H. <i>Very true, very true. To cut the matter short,
Sir, my brother Bob left all he died possessed of to his only child
Flavinda; with this proviso, mark ye. That she marry to her Aunt's
liking. Her Aunt; that's me. Otherwise, mark ye, all&mdash;to wit
ten bushels of diamonds; item of rubies; item two hundred square
miles of fertile territory bounding the River Amazon to the
Nor-Nor-East; item his snuff box; item his flageolet&mdash;he was
always one to love a tune, sir, Brother Bob; item six Macaws and as
many Concubines as he had with him at the time of his
decease&mdash;all this with other trifles needless to specify he
left, mark ye, should she fail to marry to her Aunt's
liking&mdash;that's me&mdash;to found a Chapel, Sir Spaniel, where
six poor Virgins should sing hymns in perpetuity for the repose of
his soul&mdash;which, to speak the truth, Sir Spaniel, poor Brother
Bob stands in need of, perambulating the Gulf Stream as he is and
consorting with Syrens. But take it; read the Will yourself,
Sir.</i></p>

<p>SIR S. L. (reading) <i>"Must marry to her Aunt's liking." That's
plain enough.</i></p>

<p>LADY H. H. <i>Her Aunt, Sir. That's me. That's plain
enough.</i></p>

<p>SIR S. L. (aside) <i>She speaks the truth there!</i> (Aloud)
<i>You would have me understand, Madam...?</i></p>

<p>LADY H. H. <i>Hist! Come closer. Let me whisper in your
ear...You and I have long entertained a high opinion of one
another, Sir Spaniel. Played at ball together. Bound our wrists
with daisy chains together. If I mind aright, you called me little
bride&mdash;'tis fifty years since. We might have made a match of
it, Sir Spaniel, had fortune favoured....You take my meaning,
Sir?</i></p>

<p>SIR S. L. <i>Had it been written in letters of gold, fifty feet
high, visible from Paul's Churchyard to the Goat and Compasses at
Peckham, it could have been no plainer....Hist, I'll whisper it. I,
Sir Spaniel Lilyliver, do hereby bind myself to take
thee&mdash;what's the name of the green girl that was cast up in a
lobster pot covered with seaweed? Flavinda, eh? Flavinda,
so&mdash;to be my wedded wife...O for a lawyer to have it all in
writing!</i></p>

<p>LADY H. H. <i>On condition, Sir Spaniel.</i></p>

<p>SIR S. L. <i>On condition, Asphodilla.</i></p>

<p>(Both speak together)</p>

<p><i>That the money is shared between us.</i>
</p>

<p>LADY H. H. <i>We want no lawyer to certify that! Your hand on
it, Sir Spaniel!</i></p>

<p>SIR S. L. <i>Your lips Madam!</i></p>

<p>(They embrace)</p>

<p>SIR S. L. <i>Pah! She stinks!</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Ha! Ha! Ha!" laughed the indigenous old lady in her
bathchair.</p>

<p>"Reason, begad! Reason!" exclaimed old Bartholomew, and looked
at his son as if exhorting him to give over these womanish vapours
and be a man, Sir.</p>

<p>Giles sat straight as a dart, his feet tucked under him.</p>

<p>Mrs. Manresa had out her mirror and lipstick and attended to her
lips and nose.</p>

<p>The gramophone, while the scene was removed, gently stated
certain facts which everybody knows to be perfectly true. The tune
said, more or less, how Eve, gathering her robes about her, stands
reluctant still to let her dewy mantle fall. The herded flocks, the
tune continued, in peace repose. The poor man to his cot returns,
and, to the eager ears of wife and child, the simple story of his
toil relates: what yield the furrow bears; and how the team the
plover on the nest has spared; while Wat her courses ran; and
speckled eggs in the warm hollow lay. Meanwhile the good wife on
the table spreads her simple fare; and to the shepherd's flute,
from toil released, the nymphs and swains join hands and foot it on
the green. Then Eve lets down her sombre tresses brown and spreads
her lucent veil o'er hamlet, spire, and mead, etc., etc. And the
tune repeated itself once more.</p>

<p>The view repeated in its own way what the tune was saying. The
sun was sinking; the colours were merging; and the view was saying
how after toil men rest from their labours; how coolness comes;
reason prevails; and having unharnessed the team from the plough,
neighbours dig in cottage gardens and lean over cottage gates.</p>

<p>The cows, making a step forward, then standing still, were
saying the same thing to perfection.</p>

<p>Folded in this triple melody, the audience sat gazing; and
beheld gently and approvingly without interrogation, for it seemed
inevitable, a box tree in a green tub take the place of the ladies'
dressing-room; while on what seemed to be a wall, was hung a great
clock face; the hands pointing to three minutes to the hour; which
was seven.</p>

<p>Mrs. Elmhurst roused herself from her reverie; and looked at her
programme.</p>

<p>"Scene Two. The Mall," she read out. "Time; early morning. Enter
Flavinda. Here she comes!"</p>

<p>Here came Millie Loder (shop assistant at Messrs. Hunt and
Dicksons, drapery emporium), in sprigged satin, representing
Flavinda.</p>

<p>FLAV. <i>Seven he said, and there's the clock's word for it. But
Valentine&mdash;where's Valentine? La! How my heart beats! Yet it's
not the time o' day, for I'm often afoot before the sun's up in the
meadows...See&mdash;the fine folk passing! All a-tiptoeing like
peacocks with spread tails! And I in my petticoat that looked so
fine by my Aunt's cracked mirror. Why, here it's a dish clout...And
they heap their hair up like a birthday cake stuck about with
candles....That's a diamond&mdash;that's a ruby...Where's
Valentine? The Orange Tree in the Mall, he said. The
tree&mdash;there. Valentine&mdash;nowhere. That's a courtier, I'll
warrant, that old fox with his tail between his legs. That's a
serving wench out without her master's knowledge. That's a man with
a broom to sweep paths for the fine ladies' flounces...La! the red
in their cheeks! They never got</i> that <i>in the fields, I
warrant! O faithless, cruel, hard-hearted Valentine. Valentine!
Valentine!</i></p>

<p>(She wrings her hands, turning from side to side.)</p>

<p><i>Didn't I leave my bed a-tiptoe and steal like a mouse in the
wainscot for fear of waking Aunt? And lard my hair from her powder
box? And scrub my cheeks to make 'em shine? And lie awake watching
the stars climb the chimney pots? And give my gold guinea that
Godfather hid behind the mistletoe last Twelfth Night to Deb so she
shouldn't tell on me? And grease the key in the lock so that Aunt
shouldn't wake and shriek Flavvy! Flavvy! Val, I say
Val&mdash;That's him coming....No, I could tell him a mile off the
way he strides the waves like what d'you call him in the picture
book....That's not Val....That's a cit; that's a fop; raising his
glass, prithee, to have his fill of me... I'll be home then...No, I
won't...That's to play the green girl again and sew samplers...I'm
of age, ain't I, come Michaelmas? Only three turns of the moon and
I inherit... Didn't I read it in the Will the day the ball bounced
on top of the old chest where Aunt keeps her furbelows, and the lid
opened?..." All I die possessed of to my Daughter..." So far I'd
read when the old lady came tapping down the passage like a blind
man in an alley....I'm no castaway, I'd have you know, Sir; no
fishtailed mermaid with a robe of sea weed, at your mercy. I'm a
match for any of 'em&mdash;the chits you dally with, and bid me
meet you at the Orange Tree when you're drowsing the night off
spent in their arms....Fie upon you, Sir, making sport with a poor
girl so....I'll</i> <i>not cry, I swear I won't. I'll not brew a
drop of the salt liquid for a man who's served me so...Yet to think
on't&mdash;how we hid in the dairy the day the cat jumped. And read
romances under the holly tree. La! how I cried when the Duke left
poor Polly....And my Aunt found me with eyes like red jellies.
"What stung, niece?" says she. And cried "Quick Deb, the blue bag."
I told ye...La, to think I read it all in a book and cried for
another!...Hist, what's there among the trees? It's come&mdash;it's
gone. The breeze is it? In the shade now&mdash;in the sun
now....Valentine on my life! It's he! Quick, I'll hide. Let the
tree conceal me!</i></p>

<p>(Flavinda hides behind the tree.)</p>

<p><i>He's here...He turns...He casts about...He's lost the
scent...He gazes&mdash;this way, that way....Let him feast his eyes
on the fine faces&mdash;taste 'em, sample 'em, say: "That's the
fine lady I danced with...that I lay with... that I kissed under
the mistletoe..." Ha! How he spews 'em out! Brave Valentine! How he
casts his eyes upon the ground! How his frowns become him! "Where's
Flavinda?" he sighs. "She I love like the heart in my breast." See
him pull his watch out! "O faithless wretch!" he sighs. See how he
stamps the earth! Now turns on his heel....He sees me&mdash;no, the
sun's in his eyes. Tears fill 'em...Lord, how he fingers his sword!
He'll run it through his breast like the Duke in the story
book!...Stop, Sir, stop!</i>
</p>

<p>(She reveals herself)</p>

<p>VALENTINE....<i>O Flavinda, O!</i></p>

<p>FLAVINDA<i>....O Valentine, O!</i></p>

<p>(They embrace)</p>

<p>The clock strikes nine.</p>

<p>"All that fuss about nothing!" a voice exclaimed. People
laughed. The voice stopped. But the voice had seen; the voice had
heard. For a moment Miss La Trobe behind her tree glowed with
glory. The next, turning to the villagers who were passing in and
out between the trees, she barked:</p>

<p>"Louder! Louder!"</p>

<p>For the stage was empty; the emotion must be continued; the only
thing to continue the emotion was the song; and the words were
inaudible.</p>

<p>"Louder! Louder!" She threatened them with her clenched
fists.</p>

<p><i>Digging and delving</i> (they sang), <i>hedging and ditching,
we pass....Summer and winter, autumn and spring return...All passes
but we, all changes...but we remain forever the same</i>...(the
breeze blew gaps between their words.)</p>

<p>"Louder, louder!" Miss La Trobe vociferated.</p>

<p><i>Palaces tumble down</i> (they resumed), <i>Babylon, Nineveh,
Troy</i>...<i>And Caesar's great house...all fallen they
lie...Where the plover nests was the arch... through which the
Romans trod...Digging and delving we break with the share of the
plough the clod...Where Clytemnestra watched for her Lord...saw the
beacons blaze on the hills</i>...<i>we see only the clod...Digging
and delving we pass...and the Queen and the Watch Tower fall...for
Agamemnon has ridden away....Clytemnestra is nothing but...</i></p>

<p>The words died away. Only a few great names&mdash;Babylon,
Nineveh, Clytemnestra, Agamemnon, Troy&mdash;floated across the
open space. Then the wind rose, and in the rustle of the leaves
even the great words became inaudible; and the audience sat staring
at the villagers, whose mouths opened, but no sound came.</p>

<p>And the stage was empty. Miss La Trobe leant against the tree,
paralyzed. Her power had left her. Beads of perspiration broke on
her forehead. Illusion had failed. "This is death," she murmured,
"death."</p>

<p>Then suddenly, as the illusion petered out, the cows took up the
burden. One had lost her calf. In the very nick of time she lifted
her great moon-eyed head and bellowed. All the great moon-eyed
heads laid themselves back. From cow after cow came the same
yearning bellow. The whole world was filled with dumb yearning. It
was the primeval voice sounding loud in the ear of the present
moment. Then the whole herd caught the infection. Lashing their
tails, blobbed like pokers, they tossed their heads high, plunged
and bellowed, as if Eros had planted his dart in their flanks and
goaded them to fury. The cows annihilated the gap; bridged the
distance; filled the emptiness and continued the emotion.</p>

<p>Miss La Trobe waved her hand ecstatically at the cows.</p>

<p>"Thank Heaven!" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>Suddenly the cows stopped; lowered their heads, and began
browsing. Simultaneously the audience lowered their heads and read
their programmes.</p>

<p>"The producer," Mrs. Elmhurst read out for her husband's
benefit, "craves the indulgence of the audience. Owing to lack of
time a scene has been omitted; and she begs the audience to imagine
that in the interval Sir Spaniel Lilyliver has contracted an
engagement with Flavinda; who had been about to plight her troth;
when Valentine, hidden inside the grandfather's clock, steps
forward; claims Flavinda as his bride; reveals the plot to rob her
of her inheritance; and, during the confusion that ensues, the
lovers fly together, leaving Lady Harpy and Sir Spaniel alone
together."</p>

<p>"We're asked to imagine all that," she said, putting down her
glasses.</p>

<p>"That's very wise of her," said Mrs. Manresa, addressing Mrs.
Swithin. "If she'd put it all in, we should have been here till
midnight. So we've got to imagine, Mrs. Swithin." She patted the
old lady on the knee.</p>

<p>"Imagine?" said Mrs. Swithin. "How right! Actors show us too
much. The Chinese, you know, put a dagger on the table and that's a
battle. And so Racine..."</p>

<p>"Yes, they bore one stiff," Mrs. Manresa interrupted, scenting
culture, resenting the snub to the jolly human heart. "T'other day
I took my nephew&mdash;such a jolly boy at Sandhurst&mdash;to
<i>Pop Goes the Weasel.</i> Seen it?" She turned to Giles.</p>

<p>"Up and down the City Road," he hummed by way of an answer.</p>

<p>"Did your Nanny sing that!" Mrs. Manresa exclaimed. "Mine did.
And when she said 'Pop' she made a noise like a cork being drawn
from a ginger-beer bottle. Pop!"</p>

<p>She made the noise.</p>

<p>"Hush, hush," someone whispered.</p>

<p>"Now I'm being naughty and shocking your aunt," she said. "We
must be good and attend. This is Scene Three. Lady Harpy Harraden's
Closet. The sound of horses' hooves is heard in the distance."</p>

<p>The sound of horses' hooves, energetically represented by Albert
the idiot with a wooden spoon on a tray, died away.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>LADY H. H. <i>Half-way to Gretna Green already! O my deceitful
niece! You that I rescued from the brine and stood on the
hearthstone dripping! O that the whale had swallowed you whole!
Perfidious porpoise, O! Didn't the Horn book teach you Honour thy
Great Aunt? How have you misread it and misspelt it, learnt
thieving and cheating and reading of wills in old boxes and hiding
of rascals in honest time-pieces that have never missed a second
since King Charles's day! O Flavinda! O</i> <i>porpoise, O!</i></p>

<p>SIR S. L. (trying to pull on his jack boots)
<i>Old&mdash;old&mdash;old. He called me "old"&mdash;"To your bed,
old fool, and drink hot posset!"</i></p>

<p>LADY H. H. <i>And she, stopping at the door and pointing the
finger of scorn at me said "old" Sir&mdash;"woman" Sir&mdash;I that
am in the prime of life and a lady!</i></p>

<p>SIR S. L. (tugging at his boots) <i>But I'll be even with him.
I'll have the law on' em! I'll run 'em to earth...</i></p>

<p>(He hobbles up and down, one boot on, one boot off)</p>

<p>LADY H. H. (laying her hand on his arm) <i>Have mercy on your
gout, Sir Spaniel. Bethink you, Sir&mdash;let's not run mad, we
that are on the sunny side of fifty. What's this youth they prate
on? Nothing but a goose feather blown on a north wind. Sit you
down, Sir Spaniel. Rest your leg&mdash;so&mdash;</i></p>

<p>(She pushes a cushion under his leg)</p>

<p>SIR S. L. <i>"Old" he called me...jumping from the clock like a
jack-in-the-box...And she, making mock of me, points to my leg and
cries "Cupid's darts, Sir Spaniel, Cupid's darts." O that I could
braise 'em in a mortar and serve 'em up smoking hot on the altar
of&mdash;O my gout, O my gout!</i></p>

<p>LADY H. H. <i>This talk, Sir, ill befits a man of sense. Bethink
you, Sir, only t'other day you were invoking&mdash;ahem&mdash;the
Constellations. Cassiopeia, Aldebaran; the Aurora Borealis... It's
not to be denied that one of 'em has left her sphere, has shot, has
eloped, to put it plainly, with the entrails of a time-piece, the
mere pendulum of a grandfather's clock. But, Sir Spaniel, there are
some stars that&mdash;ahem&mdash;stay fixed; that shine, to put it
in a nutshell, never so bright as by a sea-coal fire on a brisk
morning.</i></p>

<p>SIR S. L. <i>O that I were five and twenty with a sharp sword at
my side!</i></p>

<p>LADY H. H. (bridling) <i>I take your meaning, Sir. Te
hee&mdash;To be sure, I regret it as you do. But youth's not all.
To let you into a secret, I've passed the meridian myself. Am on
t'other side of the Equator too. Sleep sound o' nights without
turning. The dog days are over....But bethink you, Sir. Where
there's a will there's a way.</i></p>

<p>SIR S. L. <i>God's truth Ma'am...ah my foot's like a burning,
burning horseshoe on the devil's anvil ah!&mdash;what's your
meaning?</i></p>

<p>LADY H. H. <i>My meaning, Sir? Must I disrupt my modesty and
unquilt that which has been laid in lavender since, my lord, peace
be to his name&mdash;'tis twenty years since&mdash;was lapped in
lead? In plain words, Sir, Flavinda's flown. The cage is empty. But
we that have bound our wrists with cowslips might join 'em with a
stouter chain. To have done with fallals and figures. Here am I,
Asphodilla&mdash;but my plain name Sue. No matter what my name
is&mdash;Asphodilla or Sue&mdash;here am I, hale and hearty, at
your service. Now that the plot's out, Brother Bob's bounty must go
to the virgins. That's plain. Here's Lawyer Quill's word for it.
"Virgins...in perpetuity...sing for his soul" And I warrant you, he
has need of it...But no matter. Though we have thrown that to the
fishes that might have wrapped us in lamb's-wool, I'm no beggar.
There's messuages; tenements; napery; cattle; my dowry; an
inventory. I'll show you; engrossed on parchment; enough I'll
warrant you to keep us handsomely, for what's to run of our time,
as husband and wife.</i></p>

<p>SIR S. L. <i>Husband and wife! So that's the plain truth of it!
Why, Madam, I'd rather lash myself to a tar barrel, be bound to a
thorn tree in a winter's gale. Faugh!</i></p>

<p>LADY H. H....<i>A tar barrel, quotha! A thorn tree&mdash;quotha!
You that were harping on galaxies and milky ways! You that were
swearing I outshone 'em all! A pox on you&mdash;you faithless! You
shark, you! You serpent in jack boots, you! So you won't have me?
Reject my hand do you?</i></p>

<p>(She proffers her hand; he strikes it from him.)</p>

<p>SIR S. L....<i>Hide your chalk stones in a woollen mit! pah!
I'll none of 'em! Were they diamond, pure diamond, and half the
habitable globe and all its concubines strung in string round your
throat I'd none of it...none of it. Unhand me, scritch owl, witch,
vampire! Let me go!</i></p>

<p>LADY H. H....<i>So all your fine words were tinsel wrapped round
a Christmas cracker!</i></p>

<p>SIR S. L....<i>Bells hung on an ass's neck! Paper roses on a
barber's pole...O my foot, my foot...Cupid's darts, she mocked
me...Old, old, he called me old...</i></p>

<p>(He hobbles away)</p>

<p>LADY H. H. (left alone) <i>All gone. Following the wind. He's
gone; she's gone; and the old clock that the rascal made himself
into a pendulum for is the only one of 'em all to stop. A pox on
'em&mdash;turning an honest woman's house into a brothel. I that
was Aurora Borealis am shrunk to a tar barrel. I that was
Cassiopeia am turned to a she-ass. My head turns. There's no
trusting man nor woman; nor fine speeches; nor fine looks. Off
comes the sheep's skin; out creeps the serpent. Get ye to Gretna
Green; couch on the wet grass and breed vipers. My head spins...Tar
barrels, quotha. Cassiopeia...Chalk stones...Andromeda...Thorn
trees....Deb, I say, Deb</i> (She holloas) <i>Unlace me. I'm fit to
burst</i>...<i>Bring me my green baize table and set the
cards....And my fur lined slippers, Deb. And a dish of
chocolate....I'll</i> <i>be even with 'em...I'll outlive 'em
all...Deb, I say! Deb! A pox on the girl! Can't she hear me? Deb, I
say, you gipsy's spawn that I snatched from the hedge and taught to
sew samplers! Deb! Deb!</i></p>

<p>(She throws open the door leading to the maid's closet)</p>

<p><i>Empty! She's gone too!...</i> <i>Hist, what's that on the
dresser?</i></p>

<p>(She picks up a scrap of paper and reads)</p>

<p>"<i>What care I for your goose-feather bed? I'm off with the
raggle-taggle gipsies, O! Signed: Deborah, one time your maid." So!
She that I fed on apple parings and crusts from my own table, she
that I taught to play cribbage and sew chemises...she's gone too. O
ingratitude, thy name is Deborah! Who's to wash the dishes now;
who's to bring me my posset now, suffer my temper and unlace my
stays?...All gone. I'm alone then. Sans niece, sans lover; and sans
maid.</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>And so to end the play, the moral is,</i><br>
<i>The God of love is full of tricks;</i><br>
<i>Into the foot his dart he sticks,</i><br>
<i>But the way of the will is plain to see;</i><br>
<i>Let holy virgins hymn perpetually:</i><br>
<i>"Where there's a will there's a way"</i><br>
<i>Good people all, farewell,</i><br>
(dropping a curtsey, Lady H. H. withdrew)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The scene ended. Reason descended from her plinth. Gathering her
robes about her, serenely acknowledging the applause of the
audience, she passed across the stage; while Lords and Ladies in
stars and garters followed after; Sir Spaniel limping escorted Lady
Harraden smirking; and Valentine and Flavinda arm in arm bowed and
curtsied.</p>

<p>"God's truth!" cried Bartholomew catching the infection of the
language. "There's a moral for you!"</p>

<p>He threw himself back in his chair and laughed, like a horse
whinnying.</p>

<p>A moral. What? Giles supposed it was: Where there's a Will
there's a Way. The words rose and pointed a finger of scorn at him.
Off to Gretna Green with his girl; the deed done. Damn the
consequences.</p>

<p>"Like to see the greenhouse?" he said abruptly, turning to Mrs.
Manresa.</p>

<p>"Love to!" she exclaimed, and rose.</p>

<p>Was there an interval? Yes, the programme said so. The machine
in the bushes went chuff, chuff, chuff. And the next scene?</p>

<p>"The Victorian age," Mrs. Elmhurst read out. Presumably there
was time then for a stroll round the gardens, even for a look over
the house. Yet somehow they felt&mdash;how could one put it&mdash;a
little not quite here or there. As if the play had jerked the ball
out of the cup; as if what I call myself was still floating
unattached, and didn't settle. Not quite themselves, they felt. Or
was it simply that they felt clothes conscious? Skimpy out-of-date
voile dresses; flannel trousers; panama hats; hats wreathed with
raspberry-coloured net in the style of the Royal Duchess's hat at
Ascot seemed flimsy somehow.</p>

<p>"How lovely the clothes were," said someone, casting a last look
at Flavinda disappearing. "Most becoming. I wish..."</p>

<p>Chuff, chuff, chuff went the machine in the bushes, accurately,
insistently.</p>

<p>Clouds were passing across the sky. The weather looked a little
unsettled. Hogben's Folly was for a moment ashen white. Then the
sun struck the gilt vane of Bolney Minster.</p>

<p>"Looks a little unsettled," said someone.</p>

<p>"Up you get...Let's stretch our legs," said another voice. Soon
the lawns were floating with little moving islands of coloured
dresses. Yet some of the audience remained seated.</p>

<p>"Major and Mrs. Mayhew," Page the reporter noted, licking his
pencil. As for the play, he would collar Miss Whatshername and ask
for a synopsis. But Miss La Trobe had vanished.</p>

<p>Down among the bushes she worked like a nigger. Flavinda was in
her petticoats. Reason had thrown her mantle on a holly hedge. Sir
Spaniel was tugging at his jack boots. Miss La Trobe was scattering
and foraging.</p>

<p>"The Victorian mantle with the bead fringe...Where is the damned
thing? Chuck it here...Now the whiskers..."</p>

<p>Ducking up and down she cast her quick bird's eye over the
bushes at the audience. The audience was on the move. The audience
was strolling up and down. They kept their distance from the
dressing-room; they respected the conventions. But if they wandered
too far, if they began exploring the grounds, going over the house,
then....Chuff, chuff, chuff went the machine. Time was passing. How
long would time hold them together? It was a gamble; a risk....And
she laid about her energetically, flinging clothes on the
grass.</p>

<p>Over the tops of the bushes came stray voices, voices without
bodies, symbolical voices they seemed to her, half hearing, seeing
nothing, but still, over the bushes, feeling invisible threads
connecting the bodiless voices.</p>

<p>"It all looks very black."</p>

<p>"No one wants it&mdash;save those damned Germans."</p>

<p>There was a pause.</p>

<p>"I'd cut down those trees..."</p>

<p>"How they get their roses to grow!"</p>

<p>"They say there's been a garden here for five hundred
years..."</p>

<p>"Why even old Gladstone, to do him justice..."</p>

<p>Then there was silence. The voices passed the bushes. The trees
rustled. Many eyes, Miss La Trobe knew, for every cell in her body
was absorbent, looked at the view. Out of the corner of her eye she
could see Hogben's Folly; then the vane flashed.</p>

<p>"The glass is falling," said a voice.</p>

<p>She could feel them slipping through her fingers, looking at the
view.</p>

<p>"Where's that damned woman, Mrs. Rogers? Who's seen Mrs.
Rogers?" she cried, snatching up a Victorian mantle.</p>

<p>Then, ignoring the conventions, a head popped up between the
trembling sprays: Mrs. Swithin's.</p>

<p>"Oh Miss La Trobe!" she exclaimed; and stopped. Then she began
again; "Oh Miss La Trobe, I do congratulate you!"</p>

<p>She hesitated. "You've given me..." She skipped, then
alighted&mdash;"Ever since I was a child I've felt..." A film fell
over her eyes, shutting off the present. She tried to recall her
childhood; then gave it up; and, with a little wave of her hand, as
if asking Miss La Trobe to help her out, continued: "This daily
round; this going up and down stairs; this saying 'What am I going
for? My specs? I have 'em on my nose.'..."</p>

<p>She gazed at Miss La Trobe with a cloudless old-aged stare.
Their eyes met in a common effort to bring a common meaning to
birth. They failed; and Mrs. Swithin, laying hold desperately of a
fraction of her meaning, said: "What a small part I've had to play!
But you've made me feel I could have played... Cleopatra!"</p>

<p>She nodded between the trembling bushes and ambled off.</p>

<p>The villagers winked. "Batty" was the word for old Flimsy,
breaking through the bushes.</p>

<p>"I might have been&mdash;Cleopatra," Miss La Trobe repeated.
"You've stirred in me my unacted part," she meant.</p>

<p>"Now for the skirt, Mrs. Rogers," she said.</p>

<p>Mrs. Rogers stood grotesque in her black stockings. Miss La
Trobe pulled the voluminous flounces of the Victorian age over her
head. She tied the tapes. "You've twitched the invisible strings,"
was what the old lady meant; and revealed&mdash;of all
people&mdash;Cleopatra! Glory possessed her. Ah, but she was not
merely a twitcher of individual strings; she was one who seethes
wandering bodies and floating voices in a cauldron, and makes rise
up from its amorphous mass a recreated world. Her moment was on
her&mdash;her glory.</p>

<p>"There!" she said, tying the black ribbons under Mrs. Rogers'
chin. "That's done it! Now for the gentleman. Hammond!"</p>

<p>She beckoned Hammond. Sheepishly he came forward, and submitted
to the application of black side whiskers. With his eyes half shut,
his head leant back, he looked, Miss La Trobe thought, like King
Arthur&mdash;noble, knightly, thin.</p>

<p>"Where's the Major's old frock coat?" she asked, trusting to the
effect of that to transform him.</p>

<p>Tick, tick, tick, the machine continued. Time was passing. The
audience was wandering, dispersing. Only the tick tick of the
gramophone held them together. There, sauntering solitary far away
by the flower beds was Mrs. Giles escaping.</p>

<p>"The tune!" Miss La Trobe commanded. "Hurry up! The tune! The
next tune! Number Ten!"</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Now may I pluck," Isa murmured, picking a rose, "my single
flower. The white or the pink? And press it so, twixt thumb and
finger..."</p>

<p>She looked among the passing faces for the face of the man in
grey. There he was for one second; but surrounded, inaccessible.
And now vanished.</p>

<p>She dropped her flower. What single, separate leaf could she
press? None. Nor stray by the beds alone. She must go on; and she
turned in the direction of the stable.</p>

<p>"Where do I wander?" she mused. "Down what draughty tunnels?
Where the eyeless wind blows? And there grows nothing for the eye.
No rose. To issue where? In some harvestless dim field where no
evening lets fall her mantle; nor sun rises. All's equal there.
Unblowing, ungrowing are the roses there. Change is not; nor the
mutable and lovable; nor greetings nor partings; nor furtive
findings and feelings, where hand seeks hand and eye seeks shelter
from the eye."</p>

<p>She had come into the stable yard where the dogs were chained;
where the buckets stood; where the great pear tree spread its
ladder of branches against the wall. The tree whose roots went
beneath the flags, was weighted with hard green pears. Fingering
one of them she murmured: "How am I burdened with what they drew
from the earth; memories; possessions. This is the burden that the
past laid on me, last little donkey in the long caravanserai
crossing the desert. 'Kneel down,' said the past. 'Fill your
pannier from our tree. Rise up, donkey. Go your way till your heels
blister and your hoofs crack.'"</p>

<p>The pear was hard as stone. She looked down at the cracked flags
beneath which the roots spread. "That was the burden," she mused,
"laid on me in the cradle; murmured by waves; breathed by restless
elm trees; crooned by singing women; what we must remember; what we
would forget."</p>

<p>She looked up. The gilt hands of the stable clock pointed
inflexibly at two minutes to the hour. The clock was about to
strike.</p>

<p>"Now comes the lightning," she muttered, "from the stone blue
sky. The thongs are burst that the dead tied. Loosed are our
possessions."</p>

<p>Voices interrupted. People passed the stable yard, talking.</p>

<p>"It's a good day, some say, the day we are stripped naked.
Others, it's the end of the day. They see the Inn and the Inn's
keeper. But none speaks with a single voice. None with a voice free
from the old vibrations. Always I hear corrupt murmurs; the chink
of gold and metal. Mad music..."</p>

<p>More voices sounded. The audience was streaming back to the
terrace. She roused herself. She encouraged herself. "On little
donkey, patiently stumble. Hear not the frantic cries of the
leaders who in that they seek to lead desert us. Nor the chatter of
china faces glazed and hard. Hear rather the shepherd, coughing by
the farmyard wall; the withered tree that sighs when the Rider
gallops; the brawl in the barrack room when they stripped her
naked; or the cry which in London when I thrust the window open
someone cries..." She had come out on to the path that led past the
greenhouse. The door was kicked open. Out came Mrs. Manresa and
Giles. Unseen, Isa followed them across the lawns to the front row
of seats.</p>

<p>The chuff, chuff, chuff of the machine in the bushes had
stopped. In obedience to Miss La Trobe's command, another tune had
been put on the gramophone. Number Ten. London street cries it was
called. "A Pot Pourri."</p>

<p>"Lavender, sweet lavender, who'll buy my sweet lavender" the
tune trilled and tinkled, ineffectively shepherding the audience.
Some ignored it. Some still wandered. Others stopped, but stood
upright. Some, like Colonel and Mrs. Mayhew, who had never left
their seats, brooded over the blurred carbon sheet which had been
issued for their information.</p>

<p>"The Nineteenth Century." Colonel Mayhew did not dispute the
producer's right to skip two hundred years in less than fifteen
minutes. But the choice of scenes baffled him.</p>

<p>"Why leave out the British Army? What's history without the
Army, eh?" he mused. Inclining her head, Mrs. Mayhew protested
after all one mustn't ask too much. Besides, very likely there
would be a Grand Ensemble, round the Union Jack, to end with.
Meanwhile, there was the view. They looked at the view.</p>

<p>"Sweet lavender...sweet lavender..." Humming the tune old Mrs.
Lynn Jones (of the Mount) pushed a chair forward. "Here Etty," she
said, and plumped down, with Etty Springett, with whom, since both
were widows now, she shared a house.</p>

<p>"I remember..." she nodded in time to the tune, "You remember
too&mdash;how they used to cry it down the streets." They
remembered&mdash;the curtains blowing, and the men crying: "All a
blowing, all a growing," as they came with geraniums, sweet
william, in pots, down the street.</p>

<p>"A harp, I remember, and a hansom and a growler. So quiet the
street was then. Two for a hansom, was it? One for a growler? And
Ellen, in cap and apron, whistling in the street? D'you remember?
And the runners, my dear, who followed, all the way from the
station, if one had a box."</p>

<p>The tune changed. "Any old iron, any old iron to sell?" "D'you
remember? That was what the men shouted in the fog. Seven Dials
they came from. Men with red handkerchiefs. Garotters, did they
call them? You couldn't walk&mdash;O, dear me, no&mdash;home from
the play. Regent Street. Piccadilly. Hyde Park Corner. The loose
women...And everywhere loaves of bread in the gutter. The Irish you
know round Covent Garden...Coming back from a Ball, past the clock
at Hyde Park Corner, d'you remember the feel of white gloves?...My
father remembered the old Duke in the Park. Two fingers like
that&mdash;he'd touch his hat...I've got my mother's album. A lake
and two lovers. She'd copied out Byron, I suppose, in what was
called then the Italian hand..."</p>

<p>"What's that? 'Knocked 'em in the Old Kent Road.' I remember the
bootboy whistled it. O, my dear, the servants...Old Ellen...Sixteen
pound a year wages...And the cans of hot water! And the crinolines!
And the stays! D'you remember the Crystal Palace, and the
fireworks, and how Mira's slipper got lost in the mud?"</p>

<p>"That's young Mrs. Giles...I remember her mother. She died in
India...We wore, I suppose, a great many petticoats then.
Unhygienic? I dare say...Well, look at my daughter. To the right,
just behind you. Forty, but slim as a wand. Each flat has its
refrigerator...It took my mother half the morning to order
dinner....We were eleven. Counting servants, eighteen in
family....Now they simply ring up the Stores...That's Giles coming,
with Mrs. Manresa. She's a type I don't myself fancy. I may be
wrong...And Colonel Mayhew, as spruce as ever...And Mr. Cobbet of
Cobbs Corner, there, under the Monkey Puzzle Tree. One don't see
him often...That's what's so nice&mdash;it brings people together.
These days, when we're all so busy, that's what one wants...The
programme? Have you got it? Let's see what comes next...The
Nineteenth Century... Look, there's the chorus, the villagers,
coming on now, between the trees. First, there's a prologue..."</p>

<p>A great box, draped in red baize festooned with heavy gold
tassels had been moved into the middle of the stage. There was a
swish of dresses, a stir of chairs. The audience seated themselves,
hastily, guiltily. Miss La Trobe's eye was on them. She gave them
ten seconds to settle their faces. Then she flicked her hand. A
pompous march tune brayed. "Firm, elatant, bold and blatant,"
etc....And once more a huge symbolical figure emerged from the
bushes. It was Budge the publican; but so disguised that even
cronies who drank with him nightly failed to recognize him; and a
little titter of enquiry as to his identity ran about among the
villagers. He wore a long black many-caped cloak; waterproof;
shiny; of the substance of a statue in Parliament Square; a helmet
which suggested a policeman; a row of medals crossed his breast;
and in his right hand he held extended a special constable's baton
(loaned by Mr. Willert of the Hall). It was his voice, husky and
rusty, issuing from a thick black cotton-wool beard that gave him
away.</p>

<p>"Budge, Budge. That's Mr. Budge," the audience whispered.</p>

<p>Budge extended his truncheon and spoke:</p>

<p><i>It</i> <i>ain't an easy job, directing the traffic at 'Yde
Park Corner. Buses and 'ansom cabs. All a-clatter on the cobbles.
Keep to the right, can't you? Hi there, Stop!</i></p>

<p>(He waved his truncheon)</p>

<p><i>There she goes, the old party with the umbrella right under
the 'orse's nose.</i>
</p>

<p>(The truncheon pointed markedly at Mrs. Swithin)</p>

<p>She raised her skinny hand as if in truth she had fluttered off
the pavement on the impulse of the moment to the just rage of
authority. Got her, Giles thought, taking sides with authority
against his aunt.</p>

<p><i>Fog or fine weather, I does my duty</i> (Budge continued).
<i>At Piccadilly Circus; at 'Yde Park Corner, directing the traffic
of 'Er Majesty's Empire. The Shah of Persia; Sultan of Morocco; or
it may be 'Er Majesty in person; or Cook's tourists; black men;
white men; sailors, soldiers; crossing the ocean; to proclaim her
Empire; all of 'em Obey the Rule of my truncheon.</i></p>

<p>(He flourished it magnificently from right to left)</p>

<p><i>But my job don't end there. I take under my protection and
direction the purity and security of all Her Majesty's minions; in
all parts of her dominions; insist that they obey the laws of God
and Man.</i>
</p>

<p><i>The laws of God and Man</i> (he repeated and made as if to
consult a Statute; engrossed on a sheet of parchment which with
great deliberation he now produced from his trouser pocket)</p>

<p><i>Go</i> <i>to Church on Sunday; on Monday, nine sharp, catch
the City Bus. On Tuesday it may be, attend a meeting at the Mansion
House for the redemption of the sinner; at dinner on Wednesday
attend another&mdash;turtle soup. Some bother it may be in Ireland;
Famine. Fenians. What not. On Thursday it's the natives of Peru
require protection and correction; we give 'em what's due. But mark
you, our rule don't end there. It's a Christian country, our
Empire; under the White Queen Victoria. Over thought and religion;
drink; dress; manners; marriage too, I wield my truncheon.
Prosperity and respectability always go, as we know, 'and in 'and.
The ruler of an Empire must keep his eye on the cot; spy too in the
kitchen; drawing-room; library; wherever one or two, me and you,
come together. Purity our watchword; prosperity and respectability.
If not, why, let 'em fester in...</i></p>

<p>(He paused&mdash;no, he had not forgotten his words)</p>

<p><i>Cripplegate; St. Giles's; Whitechapel; the Minories. Let 'em
sweat at the mines; cough at the looms; rightly endure their lot.
That's the price of Empire; that's the white man's burden. And, I
can tell you, to direct the traffic orderly, at 'Yde Park Corner,
Piccadilly Circus, is a whole-time, white man's job.</i>
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>He paused, eminent, dominant, glaring from his pedestal. A very
fine figure of a man he was, everyone agreed, his truncheon
extended; his waterproof pendant. It only wanted a shower of rain,
a flight of pigeons round his head, and the pealing bells of St.
Paul's and the Abbey to transform him into the very spit and image
of a Victorian constable; and to transport them to a foggy London
afternoon, with the muffin bells ringing and the church bells
pealing at the very height of Victorian prosperity.</p>

<p>There was a pause. The voices of the pilgrims singing, as they
wound in and out between the trees, could be heard; but the words
were inaudible. The audience sat waiting.</p>

<p>"Tut-tut-tut," Mrs. Lynn-Jones expostulated. "There were grand
men among them..." Why she did not know, yet somehow she felt that
a sneer had been aimed at her father; therefore at herself.</p>

<p>Etty Springett tutted too. Yet, children did draw trucks in
mines; there was the basement; yet Papa read Walter Scott aloud
after dinner; and divorced ladies were not received at Court. How
difficult to come to any conclusion! She wished they would hurry on
with the next scene. She liked to leave a theatre knowing exactly
what was meant. Of course this was only a village play....They were
setting another scene, round the red baize box. She read out from
her programme:</p>

<p>"The Picnic Party. About 1860. Scene: A Lake.
Characters&mdash;"</p>

<p>She stopped. A sheet had been spread on the Terrace. It was a
lake apparently. Roughly painted ripples represented water. Those
green stakes were bulrushes. Rather prettily, real swallows darted
across the sheet.</p>

<p>"Look, Minnie!" she exclaimed. "Those are real swallows!"</p>

<p>"Hush, hush," she was admonished. For the scene had begun. A
young man in peg-top trousers and side whiskers carrying a spiked
stick appeared by the lake.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>EDGAR T....<i>Let me help you, Miss Hardcastle! There!</i></p>

<p>(he helps Miss Eleanor Hardcastle, a young lady in crinoline and
mushroom hat to the top. They stand for a moment panting slightly,
looking at the view.)</p>

<p>ELEANOR. <i>How small the Church looks down among the
trees!</i></p>

<p>EDGAR....<i>So this is Wanderer's Well, the
trysting-place.</i></p>

<p>ELEANOR....<i>Please Mr. Thorold, finish what you were saying
before the others come. You were saying, "Our aim in
life..."</i></p>

<p>EDGAR....<i>Should be to help our fellow men.</i></p>

<p>ELEANOR (sighing deeply) <i>How true&mdash;how profoundly
true!</i></p>

<p>EDGAR....<i>Why sigh, Miss Hardcastle?&mdash;You have nothing to
reproach yourself with&mdash;you whose whole life is spent in the
service of others. It was of myself that I was thinking. I am no
longer young. At twenty-four the best days of life are over. My
life has passed</i> (he throws a pebble on to the lake) <i>like a
ripple in water.</i></p>

<p>ELEANOR. <i>Oh Mr, Thorold, you do not know me. I am not what I
seem. I too&mdash;</i></p>

<p>EDGAR....<i>Do not tell me, Miss Hardcastle&mdash;no, I cannot
believe it&mdash;You</i> <i>have doubted?</i></p>

<p>ELEANOR. <i>Thank Heaven not that, not that...But safe and
sheltered as I am, always at home, protected as you see me, as you
think me. O what am I saying? But yes, I will speak the truth,
before Mama comes. I too have longed to convert the
heathen!</i></p>

<p>EDGAR....<i>Miss Hardcastle...Eleanor...You tempt me! Dare I ask
you? No&mdash;so young, so fair, so innocent. Think, I implore you,
before you answer.</i></p>

<p>ELEANOR....<i>I have thought&mdash;on my knees!</i></p>

<p>EDGAR (taking a ring from his pocket) <i>Then....My mother with
her last breath charged me to give this ring only to one to whom a
lifetime in the African desert among the heathens would
be&mdash;</i></p>

<p>ELEANOR (taking the ring) <i>Perfect happiness! But hist!</i>
(She slips the ring into her pocket) <i>Here's Mama!</i> (They
start asunder)</p>

<p>(Enter Mrs. Hardcastle, a stout lady in black bombazine, upon a
donkey, escorted by an elderly gentleman in a deer-stalker's
cap)</p>

<p>MRS. H....<i>So you stole a march upon us, young people. There
was a time, Sir John, when you and I were always first on top.
Now...</i></p>

<p>(He helps her to alight. Children, young men, young women, some
carrying hampers, others butterfly nets, others spy-glasses, others
tin botanical cases arrive. A rug is thrown by the lake and Mrs. H.
and Sir John seat themselves on camp stools.)</p>

<p>MRS. H....<i>Now who'll fill the kettles? Who'll gather the
sticks? Alfred</i> (to a small boy), <i>don't run about chasing
butterflies or you'll make yourself sick...Sir John and I will
unpack the hampers, here where the grass is burnt, where we had the
picnic last year.</i></p>

<p>(The young people scatter off in different directions. Mrs. H.
and Sir John begin to unpack the hamper)</p>

<p>MRS. H....<i>Last year poor dear Mr. Beach was with us. It was a
blessed release.</i> (She takes out a black-bordered handkerchief
and wipes her eyes). <i>Every year one of us is missing. That's the
ham...That's the grouse...There in that packet are the game
pasties...</i> (She spreads the eatables on the grass) <i>As I was
saying poor dear Mr. Beach...I do hope the cream hasn't curdled.
Mr. Hardcastle is bringing the claret. I always leave that to him.
Only when Mr. Hardcastle gets talking with Mr. Pigott about the
Romans...last year they quite came to words....But it's nice for
gentlemen to have a hobby, though they do gather the
dust&mdash;those skulls and things....But I was saying&mdash;poor
dear Mr. Beach....I wanted to ask you</i> (she drops her voice)
<i>as a friend of the family, about the new clergyman&mdash;they
can't hear us, can they? No, they're picking up sticks....Last
year, such a disappointment. Just got the things out...down came
the rain. But I wanted to ask you, about the new clergyman, the one
who's come in place of dear Mr. Beach. I'm told the name's
Sibthorp. To be sure, I hope I'm right, for I had a cousin who
married a girl of that name, and as a friend of the family, we
don't stand on ceremony...And when one has daughters&mdash;I'm sure
I quite envy you, with only one daughter, Sir John, and I have
four! So I was asking you to tell me in confidence, about this
young&mdash;if that's-his-name&mdash;Sibthorp, for I must tell you
the day before yesterday our Mrs. Potts happened to say, as she
passed the Rectory, bringing our laundry, they were unpacking the
furniture; and what did she see on top of the wardrobe? A tea cosy!
But of course she might be mistaken...But it occurred to me to ask
you, as a friend of the family, in confidence,</i> has Mr. Sibthorp
a wife?</p>

<p>Here a chorus composed of villagers in Victorian mantles, side
whiskers and top hats sang in concert:</p>

<p><i>O</i> <i>has Mr. Sibthorp a wife? O has Mr. Sibthorp a wife?
That is the hornet, the bee in the bonnet, the screw in the cork
and the drill; that whirling and twirling are for ever unfurling
the folds of the motherly heart; for a mother must ask, if
daughters she has, begot in the feathery billowy fourposter family
bed, O did he unpack, with his prayer book and bands; his gown and
his cane; his rod and his line; and the family album and gun; did
he also display the connubial respectable tea-table token, a cosy
with honeysuckle embossed. Has Mr. Sibthorp a wife? O has Mr.
Sibthorp a wife?</i></p>

<p>While the chorus was sung, the picnickers assembled. Corks
popped. Grouse, ham, chickens were sliced. Lips munched. Glasses
were drained. Nothing was heard but the chump of jaws and the chink
of glasses.</p>

<p>"They did eat," Mrs. Lynn Jones whispered to Mrs. Springett.
"That's true. More than was good for them, I dare say."</p>

<p>MR. HARDCASTLE...(brushing flakes of meat from his whiskers)
<i>Now</i>...</p>

<p>"Now what?" whispered Mrs. Springett, anticipating further
travesty.</p>

<p><i>Now that we have gratified the inner man, let us gratify the
desire of the spirit. I call upon one of the young ladies for a
song.</i>
</p>

<p>CHORUS OF YOUNG LADIES <i>...O not me...not me...I really
couldn't...No, you cruel thing, you know I've lost my voice...I
can't sing without the instrument...etc., etc.</i></p>

<p>CHORUS OF YOUNG MEN. <i>O</i> <i>bosh! Let's have "The Last Rose
of Summer." Let's have "I never loved a Dear Gazelle."</i></p>

<p>MRS. H. (authoritatively) <i>Eleanor and Mildred will now sing
"I'd be a Butterfly."</i></p>

<p>(Eleanor and Mildred rise obediently and sing a duet: "I'd be a
Butterfly.")</p>

<p>MRS. H. <i>Thank you very much, my dears. And now gentlemen, Our
Country!</i></p>

<p>(Arthur and Edgar sing "Rule Britannia.")</p>

<p>MRS. H....<i>Thank you very much. Mr. Hardcastle&mdash;</i></p>

<p>MR. HARDCASTLE (rising to his feet, clasping his fossil) <i>Let
us pray.</i></p>

<p>(the whole company rise to their feet)</p>

<p>"This is too much, too much," Mrs. Springett protested.</p>

<p>MR. H....<i>Almighty God, giver of all good things, we thank
Thee; for our food and drink; for the beauties of Nature; for the
understanding with which Thou hast enlightened us</i> (he fumbled
with his fossil) <i>And for thy great gift of Peace. Grant us to be
thy servants on earth; grant us to spread the light of
thy...</i></p>

<p>Here the hindquarters of the donkey, represented by Albert the
idiot, became active. Intentional was it, or accidental? "Look at
the donkey! Look at the donkey!" A titter drowned Mr. Hardcastle's
prayer; and then he was heard saying:</p>

<p>...<i>a happy homecoming with bodies refreshed by thy bounty,
and minds inspired by thy wisdom. Amen.</i></p>

<p>Holding his fossil in front of him, Mr. Hardcastle marched off.
The donkey was captured; hampers were loaded; and forming into a
procession, the picnickers began to disappear over the hill.</p>

<p>EDGAR (winding up the procession with Eleanor) <i>To convert the
heathen!</i></p>

<p>ELEANOR. <i>To help our fellow men!</i></p>

<p>(The actors disappeared into the bushes.)</p>

<p>BUDGE....<i>It's time, gentlemen, time ladies, time to pack up
and be gone. From where I stand, truncheon in hand, guarding
respectability, and prosperity, and the purity of Victoria's land,
I see before me</i>&mdash;(he pointed: there was Pointz Hall; the
rooks cawing; the smoke rising)</p>

<center>
<p><i>'Ome, Sweet 'Ome.</i>
</p>
</center>

<p>The gramophone took up the strain: <i>Through pleasures and
palaces, etc. There's no place like Home.</i></p>

<p>BUDGE....<i>Home, gentlemen; home, ladies, it's time to pack up
and go home. Don't I see the fire</i> (he pointed: one window
blazed red) <i>blazing ever higher? In kitchen; and nursery;
drawing-room and library? That's the fire of 'Ome. And see! Our
Jane has brought the tea. Now children where's the toys? Mama, your
knitting, quick. For here</i> (he swept his truncheon at Cobbet of
Cobbs Corner) <i>comes the bread-winner, home from the city, home
from the counter, home from the shop. "Mama, a cup o' tea."
"Children, gather round my knee. I will read aloud. Which shall it
be? Sindbad the sailor? Or some simple tale from the Scriptures?
And show you the pictures? What none of 'em? Then out with the
bricks. Let's build: A conservatory. A laboratory? A mechanics'
institute? Or shall it be a tower; with our flag on top; where our
widowed Queen, after tea, calls the Royal orphans round her knee?
For it's 'Ome, ladies, 'Ome, gentlemen. Be it never so humble,
there's no place like 'Ome."</i></p>

<p>The gramophone warbled Home, Sweet Home, and Budge, swaying
slightly, descended from his box and followed the procession off
the stage.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>There was an interval.</p>

<p>"Oh but it was beautiful," Mrs. Lynn Jones protested. Home she
meant; the lamplit room; the ruby curtains; and Papa reading
aloud.</p>

<p>They were rolling up the lake and uprooting the bulrushes. Real
swallows were skimming over real grass. But she still saw the
home.</p>

<p>"It was..." she repeated, referring to the home.</p>

<p>"Cheap and nasty, I call it," snapped Etty Springett, referring
to the play, and shot a vicious glance at Dodge's green trousers,
yellow spotted tie, and unbuttoned waistcoat.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Lynn Jones still saw the home. Was there, she mused, as
Budge's red baize pediment was rolled off, something&mdash;not
impure, that wasn't the word&mdash;but perhaps "unhygienic" about
the home? Like a bit of meat gone sour, with whiskers, as the
servants called it? Or why had it perished? Time went on and on
like the hands of the kitchen clock. (The machine chuffed in the
bushes.) If they had met with no resistance, she mused, nothing
wrong, they'd still be going round and round and round. The Home
would have remained; and Papa's beard, she thought, would have
grown and grown; and Mama's knitting&mdash;what did she do with all
her knitting?&mdash;Change had to come, she said to herself, or
there'd have been yards and yards of Papa's beard, of Mama's
knitting. Nowadays her son-in-law was clean shaven. Her daughter
had a refrigerator....Dear, how my mind wanders, she checked
herself. What she meant was, change had to come, unless things were
perfect; in which case she supposed they resisted Time. Heaven was
changeless.</p>

<p>"Were they like that?" Isa asked abruptly. She looked at Mrs.
Swithin as if she had been a dinosaur or a very diminutive mammoth.
Extinct she must be, since she had lived in the reign of Queen
Victoria.</p>

<p>Tick, tick, tick, went the machine in the bushes.</p>

<p>"The Victorians," Mrs. Swithin mused. "I don't believe" she said
with her odd little smile, "that there ever were such people. Only
you and me and William dressed differently."</p>

<p>"You don't believe in history," said William.</p>

<p>The stage remained empty. The cows moved in the field. The
shadows were deeper under the trees.</p>

<p>Mrs. Swithin caressed her cross. She gazed vaguely at the view.
She was off, they guessed, on a circular tour of the
imagination&mdash;one-making. Sheep, cows, grass, trees,
ourselves&mdash;all are one. If discordant, producing
harmony&mdash;if not to us, to a gigantic ear attached to a
gigantic head. And thus&mdash;she was smiling benignly&mdash;the
agony of the particular sheep, cow, or human being is necessary;
and so&mdash;she was beaming seraphically at the gilt vane in the
distance&mdash;we reach the conclusion that <i>all</i> is harmony,
could we hear it. And we shall. Her eyes now rested on the white
summit of a cloud. Well, if the thought gave her comfort, William
and Isa smiled across her, let her think it.</p>

<p>Tick tick tick the machine reiterated.</p>

<p>"D'you get her meaning?" said Mrs. Swithin alighting suddenly.
"Miss La Trobe's?"</p>

<p>Isa, whose eyes had been wandering, shook her head.</p>

<p>"But you might say the same of Shakespeare," said Mrs.
Swithin.</p>

<p>"Shakespeare and the musical glasses!" Mrs. Manresa intervened.
"Dear, what a barbarian you all make me feel!"</p>

<p>She turned to Giles. She invoked his help against this attack
upon the jolly human heart.</p>

<p>"Tosh," Giles muttered.</p>

<p>Nothing whatever appeared on the stage.</p>

<p>Darts of red and green light flashed from the rings on Mrs.
Manresa's fingers. He looked from them at Aunt Lucy. From her to
William Dodge. From him to Isa. She refused to meet his eyes. And
he looked down at his blood-stained tennis shoes.</p>

<p>He said (without words) "I'm damnably unhappy."</p>

<p>"So am I," Dodge echoed.</p>

<p>"And I too," Isa thought.</p>

<p>They were all caught and caged; prisoners; watching a spectacle.
Nothing happened. The tick of the machine was maddening.</p>

<p>"On, little donkey" Isa murmured, "crossing the desert...
bearing your burden..."</p>

<p>She felt Dodge's eye upon her as her lips moved. Always some
cold eye crawled over the surface like a winter blue-bottle! She
flicked him off.</p>

<p>"What a time they take!" she exclaimed irritably.</p>

<p>"Another interval," Dodge read out, looking at the
programme.</p>

<p>"And after that, what?" asked Lucy.</p>

<p>"Present time. Ourselves," he read.</p>

<p>"Let's hope to God that's the end," said Giles gruffly.</p>

<p>"Now you're being naughty," Mrs. Manresa reproved her little
boy, her surly hero.</p>

<p>No one moved. There they sat, facing the empty stage, the cows,
the meadows and the view, while the machine ticked in the
bushes.</p>

<p>"What's the object," said Bartholomew, suddenly rousing himself,
"of this entertainment?"</p>

<p>"The profits," Isa read out from her blurred carbon copy, "are
to go to a fund for installing electric light in the Church."</p>

<p>"All our village festivals," Mr. Oliver snorted turning to Mrs.
Manresa, "end with a demand for money."</p>

<p>"Of course, of course," she murmured, deprecating his severity,
and the coins in her bead bag jingled.</p>

<p>"Nothing's done for nothing in England," the old man continued.
Mrs. Manresa protested. It might be true, perhaps, of the
Victorians; but surely not of ourselves? Did she really believe
that we were disinterested? Mr. Oliver demanded.</p>

<p>"Oh you don't know my husband!" the wild child exclaimed,
striking an attitude.</p>

<p>Admirable woman! You could trust her to crow when the hour
struck like an alarm clock; to stop like an old bus horse when the
bell rang. Oliver said nothing. Mrs. Manresa had out her mirror and
attended to her face.</p>

<p>All their nerves were on edge. They sat exposed. The machine
ticked. There was no music. The horns of cars on the high road were
heard. And the swish of trees. They were neither one thing nor the
other; neither Victorians nor themselves. They were suspended,
without being, in limbo. Tick, tick, tick went the machine.</p>

<p>Isa fidgeted; glancing to right and to left over her
shoulder.</p>

<p>"Four and twenty blackbirds, strung upon a string," she
muttered.</p>

<p>"Down came an Ostrich, an eagle, an executioner,</p>

<p>'Which of you is ripe,' he said, 'to bake in my pie?</p>

<p>Which of you is ripe, which of you is ready,</p>

<p>Come my pretty gentleman,</p>

<p>Come my pretty lady.'..."</p>

<p>How long was she going to keep them waiting? "The present time.
Ourselves." They read it on the programme. Then they read what came
next: "The profits are to go to a fund for installing electric
light in the Church." Where was the Church? Over there. You could
see the spire among the trees.</p>

<p>"Ourselves..." They returned to the programme. But what could
she know about ourselves? The Elizabethans yes; the Victorians,
perhaps; but ourselves; sitting here on a June day in 1939&mdash;it
was ridiculous. "Myself"&mdash;it was impossible. Other people,
perhaps...Cobbet of Cobbs Corner; the Major; old Bartholomew; Mrs.
Swithin&mdash;them, perhaps. But she won't get me&mdash;no, not me.
The audience fidgeted. Sounds of laughter came from the bushes. But
nothing whatsoever appeared on the stage.</p>

<p>"What's she keeping us waiting for?" Colonel Mayhew asked
irritably. "They don't need to dress up if it's present time."</p>

<p>Mrs. Mayhew agreed. Unless of course she was going to end with a
Grand Ensemble. Army; Navy; Union Jack; and behind them
perhaps&mdash;Mrs. Mayhew sketched what she would have done had it
been her pageant&mdash;the Church. In cardboard. One window,
looking east, brilliantly illuminated to symbolize&mdash;she could
work that out when the time came.</p>

<p>"There she is, behind the tree," she whispered, pointing at Miss
La Trobe.</p>

<p>Miss La Trobe stood there with her eye on her script. "After
Vic." she had written, "try ten mins. of present time. Swallows,
cows etc." She wanted to expose them, as it were, to douche them,
with present-time reality. But something was going wrong with the
experiment. "Reality too strong," she muttered. "Curse 'em!" She
felt everything they felt. Audiences were the devil. O to write a
play without an audience&mdash;<i>the</i> play. But here she was
fronting her audience. Every second they were slipping the noose.
Her little game had gone wrong. If only she'd a back-cloth to hang
between the trees&mdash;to shut out cows, swallows, present time!
But she had nothing. She had forbidden music. Grating her fingers
in the bark, she damned the audience. Panic seized her. Blood
seemed to pour from her shoes. This is death, death, death, she
noted in the margin of her mind; when illusion fails. Unable to
lift her hand, she stood facing the audience.</p>

<p>And then the shower fell, sudden, profuse.</p>

<p>No one had seen the cloud coming. There it was, black, swollen,
on top of them. Down it poured like all the people in the world
weeping. Tears, Tears. Tears.</p>

<p>"O that our human pain could here have ending!" Isa murmured.
Looking up she received two great blots of rain full in her face.
They trickled down her cheeks as if they were her own tears. But
they were all people's tears, weeping for all people. Hands were
raised. Here and there a parasol opened. The rain was sudden and
universal. Then it stopped. From the grass rose a fresh earthy
smell.</p>

<p>"That's done it," sighed Miss La Trobe, wiping away the drops on
her cheeks. Nature once more had taken her part. The risk she had
run acting in the open air was justified. She brandished her
script. Music began&mdash;A.B.C.&mdash;A.B.C. The tune was as
simple as could be. But now that the shower had fallen, it was the
other voice speaking, the voice that was no one's voice. And the
voice that wept for human pain unending said:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>The King is in his counting house,</i><br>
<i>Counting out his money,</i><br>
<i>The Queen is in her parlour...</i>
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>"O that my life could here have ending," Isa murmured (taking
care not to move her lips). Readily would she endow this voice with
all her treasure if so be tears could be ended. The little twist of
sound could have the whole of her. On the altar of the rain-soaked
earth she laid down her sacrifice...</p>

<p>"O look!" she cried aloud.</p>

<p>That was a ladder. And that (a cloth roughly painted) was a
wall. And that a man with a hod on his back. Mr. Page the reporter,
licking his pencil, noted: "With the very limited means at her
disposal, Miss La Trobe conveyed to the audience Civilization (the
wall) in ruins; rebuilt (witness man with hod) by human effort;
witness also woman handing bricks. Any fool could grasp that. Now
issued black man in fuzzy wig; coffee-coloured ditto in silver
turban; they signify presumably the League of..."</p>

<p>A burst of applause greeted this flattering tribute to
ourselves. Crude of course. But then she had to keep expenses down.
A painted cloth must convey&mdash;what the <i>Times</i> and
<i>Telegraph</i> both said in their leaders that very morning.</p>

<p>The tune hummed:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>The King is in his counting house,</i><br>
<i>Counting out his money,</i><br>
<i>The Queen is in her parlour</i><br>
<i>Eating</i>...</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Suddenly the tune stopped. The tune changed. A waltz, was it?
Something half known, half not. The swallows danced it. Round and
round, in and out they skimmed. Real swallows. Retreating and
advancing. And the trees, O the trees, how gravely and sedately
like senators in council, or the spaced pillars of some cathedral
church....Yes, they barred the music, and massed and hoarded; and
prevented what was fluid from overflowing. The swallows&mdash;or
martins were they?&mdash;The temple-haunting martins who come, have
always come...Yes, perched on the wall, they seemed to foretell
what after all the <i>Times</i> was saying yesterday. Homes will be
built. Each flat with its refrigerator, in the crannied wall. Each
of us a free man; plates washed by machinery; not an aeroplane to
vex us; all liberated; made whole...</p>

<p>The tune changed; snapped; broke; jagged. Fox-trot was it? Jazz?
Anyhow the rhythm kicked, reared, snapped short. What a jangle and
a jingle! Well, with the means at her disposal, you can't ask too
much. What a cackle, a cacophony! Nothing ended. So abrupt. And
corrupt. Such an outrage; such an insult. And not plain. Very up to
date, all the same. What is her game? To disrupt? Jog and trot?
Jerk and smirk? Put the finger to the nose? Squint and pry? Peak
and spy? O the irreverence of the generation which is only
momentarily&mdash;thanks be&mdash;"the young." The young, who can't
make, but only break; shiver into splinters the old vision; smash
to atoms what was whole. What a cackle, what a rattle, what a
yaffle&mdash;as they call the woodpecker, the laughing bird that
flits from tree to tree.</p>

<p>Look! Out they come, from the bushes&mdash;the riff-raff.
Children? Imps&mdash;elves&mdash;demons. Holding what? Tin cans?
Bedroom candlesticks? Old jars? My dear, that's the cheval glass
from the Rectory! And the mirror&mdash;that I lent her. My
mother's. Cracked. What's the notion? Anything that's bright enough
to reflect, presumably, ourselves?</p>

<p>Ourselves! Ourselves!</p>

<p>Out they leapt, jerked, skipped. Flashing, dazzling, dancing,
jumping. Now old Bart...he was caught. Now Manresa. Here a
nose...There a skirt...Then trousers only...Now perhaps a
face....Ourselves? But that's cruel. To snap us as we are, before
we've had time to assume...And only, too, in parts....That's what's
so distorting and upsetting and utterly unfair.</p>

<p>Mopping, mowing, whisking, frisking, the looking glasses darted,
flashed, exposed. People in the back rows stood up to see the fun.
Down they sat, caught themselves...What an awful show-up! Even for
the old who, one might suppose, hadn't any longer any care about
their faces....And Lord! the jangle and the din! The very cows
joined in. Walloping, tail lashing, the reticence of nature was
undone, and the barriers which should divide Man the Master from
the Brute were dissolved. Then the dogs joined in. Excited by the
uproar, scurrying and worrying, here they came! Look at them! And
the hound, the Afghan hound...look at him!</p>

<p>Then once more, in the uproar which by this time has passed
quite beyond control, behold Miss Whatshername behind the tree
summoned from the bushes&mdash;or was it <i>they</i> who broke
away&mdash;Queen Bess; Queen Anne; and the girl in the Mall; and
the Age of Reason; and Budge the policeman. Here they came. And the
Pilgrims. And the lovers. And the grandfather's clock. And the old
man with a beard. They all appeared. What's more, each declaimed
some phrase or fragment from their parts...<i>I am not</i> (said
one) <i>in my perfect mind...</i> Another, <i>Reason am I...And I?
I'm the old top hat....Home is the hunter, home from the
hill...Home? Where the miner sweats, and the maiden faith is rudely
strumpeted.</i>... <i>Sweet and low; sweet and low, wind of the
western sea...Is that a dagger that I see before me?...The owl
hoots and the ivy mocks tap-tap-tapping on the pane....Lady I love
till I die, leave thy chamber and come...Where the worm weaves its
winding sheet...I'd be a butterfly. I'd be a butterfly... In thy
will is our peace....Here, Papa, take your book and read
aloud....Hark, hark, the dogs do bark and the beggars...</i></p>

<p>It was the cheval glass that proved too heavy. Young Bonthorp
for all his muscle couldn't lug the damned thing about any longer.
He stopped. So did they all&mdash;hand glasses, tin cans, scraps of
scullery glass, harness room glass, and heavily embossed silver
mirrors&mdash;all stopped. And the audience saw themselves, not
whole by any means, but at any rate sitting still.</p>

<p>The hands of the clock had stopped at the present moment. It was
now. Ourselves.</p>

<p>So that was her little game! To show us up, as we are, here and
how. All shifted, preened, minced; hands were raised, legs shifted.
Even Bart, even Lucy, turned away. All evaded or shaded
themselves&mdash;save Mrs. Manresa who, facing herself in the
glass, used it as a glass; had out her mirror; powdered her nose;
and moved one curl, disturbed by the breeze, to its place.</p>

<p>"Magnificent!" cried old Bartholomew. Alone she preserved
unashamed her identity, and faced without blinking herself. Calmly
she reddened her lips.</p>

<p>The mirror bearers squatted; malicious; observant; expectant;
expository.</p>

<p>"That's them," the back rows were tittering. "Must we submit
passively to this malignant indignity?" the front row demanded.
Each turned ostensibly to say&mdash;O whatever came handy&mdash;to
his neighbour. Each tried to shift an inch or two beyond the
inquisitive insulting eye. Some made as if to go.</p>

<p>"The play's over, I take it," muttered Colonel Mayhew,
retrieving his hat. "It's time..."</p>

<p>But before they had come to any common conclusion, a voice
asserted itself. Whose voice it was no one knew. It came from the
bushes&mdash;a megaphontic, anonymous, loud-speaking affirmation.
The voice said:</p>

<p><i>Before we part, ladies and gentlemen, before we go...</i>
(Those who had risen sat down)...<i>let's talk in words of one
syllable, without larding, stuffing or cant. Let's break the rhythm
and forget the rhyme. And calmly consider ourselves. Ourselves.
Some bony. Some fat.</i> (The glasses confirmed this.) <i>Liars
most of us. Thieves too.</i> (The glasses made no comment on that.)
<i>The poor are as bad as the rich are. Perhaps worse. Don't hide
among rags. Or let our cloth protect us. Or for the matter of that
book learning; or skilful practice on pianos; or laying on of
paint. Or presume there's innocency in childhood. Consider the
sheep. Or faith in love. Consider the dogs. Or virtue in those that
have grown white hairs. Consider the gun slayers, bomb droppers
here or there. They do openly what we do slyly. Take for
example</i> (here the megaphone adopted a colloquial,
conversational tone) <i>Mr. M's bungalow. A view spoilt for ever.
That's murder</i>...<i>Or Mrs. E's lipstick and blood-red
nails....A tyrant, remember, is half a slave. Item the vanity of
Mr. H. the writer, scraping in the dunghill for sixpenny
fame...Then there's the amiable condescension of the lady of the
manor&mdash;the upper class manner. And buying shares in the market
to sell 'em....O we're all the same. Take myself now. Do I escape
my own reprobation, simulating indignation, in the bush, among the
leaves? There's a rhyme, to suggest, in spite of protestation and
the desire for immolation, I too have had some, what's called,
education...Look at ourselves, ladies and gentlemen! Then at the
wall; and ask how's this wall, the great wall, which we call,
perhaps miscall, civilization, to be built by</i> (here the mirrors
flicked and flashed) <i>orts, scraps and fragments like
ourselves?</i></p>

<p><i>All the same here I change (by way of the rhyme mark ye) to a
loftier strain&mdash;there's something to be said: for our kindness
to the cat; note too in to-day's paper "Dearly loved by his wife";
and the impulse which leads us&mdash;mark you, when no one's
looking&mdash;to the window at midnight to smell the bean. Or the
resolute refusal of some pimpled dirty little scrub in sandals to
sell his soul. There is such a thing&mdash;you can't deny it. What?
You can't descry it? All you can see of yourselves is scraps, orts
and fragments? Well then listen to the gramophone affirming...</i>
</p>

<p>A hitch occurred here. The records had been mixed. Fox trot,
Sweet lavender, Home Sweet Home, Rule Britannia&mdash;sweating
profusely, Jimmy, who had charge of the music, threw them aside and
fitted the right one&mdash;was it Bach, Handel, Beethoven, Mozart
or nobody famous, but merely a traditional tune? Anyhow, thank
heaven, it was somebody speaking after the anonymous bray of the
infernal megaphone.</p>

<p>Like quicksilver sliding, filings magnetized, the distracted
united. The tune began; the first note meant a second; the second a
third. Then down beneath a force was born in opposition; then
another. On different levels they diverged. On different levels
ourselves went forward; flower gathering some on the surface;
others descending to wrestle with the meaning; but all
comprehending; all enlisted. The whole population of the mind's
immeasurable profundity came flocking; from the unprotected, the
unskinned; and dawn rose; and azure; from chaos and cacophony
measure; but not the melody of surface sound alone controlled it;
but also the warring battle-plumed warriors straining asunder: To
part? No. Compelled from the ends of the horizon; recalled from the
edge of appalling crevasses; they crashed; solved; united. And some
relaxed their fingers; and others uncrossed their legs.</p>

<p>Was that voice ourselves? Scraps, orts and fragments, are we,
also, that? The voice died away.</p>

<p>As waves withdrawing uncover; as mist uplifting reveals; so,
raising their eyes (Mrs. Manresa's were wet; for an instant tears
ravaged her powder) they saw, as waters withdrawing leave visible a
tramp's old boot, a man in a clergyman's collar surreptitiously
mounting a soap-box.</p>

<p>"The Rev. G. W. Streatfield," the reporter licked his pencil and
noted "then spoke..."</p>

<p>All gazed. What an intolerable constriction, contraction, and
reduction to simplified absurdity he was to be sure! Of all
incongruous sights a clergyman in the livery of his servitude to
the summing up was the most grotesque and entire. He opened his
mouth. O Lord, protect and preserve us from words the defilers,
from words the impure! What need have we of words to remind us?
Must I be Thomas, you Jane?</p>

<p>As if a rook had hopped unseen to a prominent bald branch, he
touched his collar and hemmed his preliminary croak. One fact
mitigated the horror; his forefinger, raised in the customary
manner, was stained with tobacco juice. He wasn't such a bad
fellow; the Rev. G. W. Streatfield; a piece of traditional church
furniture; a corner cupboard; or the top beam of a gate, fashioned
by generations of village carpenters after some
lost-in-the-mists-of-antiquity model.</p>

<p>He looked at the audience; then up at the sky. The whole lot of
them, gentles and simples, felt embarrassed, for him, for
themselves. There he stood their representative spokesman; their
symbol; themselves; a butt, a clod, laughed at by looking-glasses;
ignored by the cows, condemned by the clouds which continued their
majestic rearrangement of the celestial landscape; an irrelevant
forked stake in the flow and majesty of the summer silent
world.</p>

<p>His first words (the breeze had risen; the leaves were rustling)
were lost. Then he was heard saying: "What." To that word he added
another "Message"; and at last a whole sentence emerged; not
comprehensible; say rather audible. "What message," it seemed he
was asking, "was our pageant meant to convey?"</p>

<p>They folded their hands in the traditional manner as if they
were seated in church.</p>

<p>"I have been asking myself"&mdash;the words were
repeated&mdash;"what meaning, or message, this pageant was meant to
convey?"</p>

<p>If he didn't know, calling himself Reverend, also M.A., who
after all could?</p>

<p>"As one of the audience," he continued (words now put on
meaning) "I will offer, very humbly, for I am not a
critic"&mdash;and he touched the white gate that enclosed his neck
with a yellow forefinger&mdash;"my interpretation. No, that is too
bold a word. The gifted lady..." He looked round. La Trobe was
invisible. He continued: "Speaking merely as one of the audience, I
confess I was puzzled. For what reason, I asked, were we shown
these scenes? Briefly, it is true. The means at our disposal this
afternoon were limited. Still we were shown different groups. We
were shown, unless I mistake, the effort renewed. A few were
chosen; the many passed in the background. That surely we were
shown. But again, were we not given to understand&mdash;am I too
presumptuous? Am I treading, like angels, where as a fool I should
absent myself? To me at least it was indicated that we are members
one of another. Each is part of the whole. Yes, that occurred to
me, sitting among you in the audience. Did I not perceive Mr.
Hardcastle here" (he pointed) "at one time a Viking? And in Lady
Harridan&mdash;excuse me, if I get the names wrong&mdash;a
Canterbury pilgrim? We act different parts; but are the same. That
I leave to you. Then again, as the play or pageant proceeded, my
attention was distracted. Perhaps that too was part of the
producer's intention? I thought I perceived that nature takes her
part. Dare we, I asked myself, limit life to ourselves? May we not
hold that there is a spirit that inspires, pervades..." (the
swallows were sweeping round him. They seemed cognizant of his
meaning. Then they swept out of sight.) "I leave that to you. I am
not here to explain. That role has not been assigned me. I speak
only as one of the audience, one of ourselves. I caught myself too
reflected, as it happened in my own mirror..." (Laughter) "Scraps,
orts and fragments! Surely, we should unite?"</p>

<p>"But" ("but" marked a new paragraph) "I speak also in another
capacity. As Treasurer of the Fund. In which capacity" (he
consulted a sheet of paper) "I am glad to be able to tell you that
a sum of thirty-six pounds ten shillings and eightpence has been
raised by this afternoon's entertainment towards our object: the
illumination of our dear old church."</p>

<p>"Applause," the reporter reported.</p>

<p>Mr. Streatfield paused. He listened. Did he hear some distant
music?</p>

<p>He continued: "But there is still a deficit" (he consulted his
paper) "of one hundred and seventy-five pounds odd. So that each of
us who has enjoyed this pageant has still an opp..." The word was
cut in two. A zoom severed it. Twelve aeroplanes in perfect
formation like a flight of wild duck came overhead. <i>That</i> was
the music. The audience gaped; the audience gazed. Then zoom became
drone. The planes had passed.</p>

<p>"...portunity," Mr. Streatfield continued, "to make a
contribution." He signalled. Instantly collecting boxes were in
operation. Hidden behind glasses they emerged. Coppers rattled.
Silver jingled. But O what a pity&mdash;how creepy it made one
feel! Here came Albert, the idiot, jingling his collecting
box&mdash;an aluminium saucepan without a lid. You couldn't very
well deny him, poor fellow. Shillings were dropped. He rattled and
sniggered; chattered and jibbered. As Mrs. Parker made her
contribution&mdash;half a crown as it happened&mdash;she appealed
to Mr. Streatfield to exorcize this evil, to extend the protection
of his cloth.</p>

<p>The good man contemplated the idiot benignly. His faith had
room, he indicated, for him too. He too, Mr. Streatfield appeared
to be saying, is part of ourselves. But not a part we like to
recognize, Mrs. Springett added silently, dropping her
sixpence.</p>

<p>Contemplating the idiot, Mr. Streatfield had lost the thread of
his discourse. His command over words seemed gone. He twiddled the
cross on his watchchain. Then his hand sought his trouser pocket.
Surreptitiously he extracted a small silver box. It was plain to
all that the natural desire of the natural man was overcoming him.
He had no further use for words.</p>

<p>"And now," he resumed, cuddling the pipe lighter in the palm of
his hand, "for the pleasantest part of my duty. To propose a vote
of thanks to the gifted lady..." He looked round for an object
corresponding to this description. None such was visible. "...who
wishes it seems to remain anonymous." He paused. "And so..." He
paused again.</p>

<p>It was an awkward moment. How to make an end? Whom to thank?
Every sound in nature was painfully audible; the swish of the
trees; the gulp of a cow; even the skim of the swallows over the
grass could be heard. But no one spoke. Whom could they make
responsible? Whom could they thank for their entertainment? Was
there no one?</p>

<p>Then there was a scuffle behind the bush; a preliminary
premonitory scratching. A needle scraped a disc; chuff, chuff
chuff; then having found the rut, there was a roll and a flutter
which portended <i>God</i>...(they all rose to their feet) <i>Save
the King.</i></p>

<p>Standing the audience faced the actors; who also stood with
their collecting boxes quiescent, their looking-glasses hidden, and
the robes of their various parts hanging stiff.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<center>
<p><i>Happy and glorious,</i><br>
<i>Long to reign over us</i><br>
<i>God save the King</i>
</p>
</center>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The notes died away.</p>

<p>Was that the end? The actors were reluctant to go. They
lingered; they mingled. There was Budge the policeman talking to
old Queen Bess. And the Age of Reason hobnobbed with the foreparts
of the donkey. And Mrs. Hardcastle patted out the folds of her
crinoline. And little England, still a child, sucked a peppermint
drop out of a bag. Each still acted the unacted part conferred on
them by their clothes. Beauty was on them. Beauty revealed them.
Was it the light that did it?&mdash;the tender, the fading, the
uninquisitive but searching light of evening that reveals depths in
water and makes even the red brick bungalow radiant?</p>

<p>"Look," the audience whispered, "O look, look, look.&mdash;" And
once more they applauded; and the actors joined hands and
bowed.</p>

<p>Old Mrs. Lynn Jones, fumbling for her bag, sighed, "What a
pity&mdash;must they change?"</p>

<p>But it was time to pack up and be off.</p>

<p>"Home, gentlemen; home ladies; it's time to pack up and be off,"
the reporter whistled, snapping the band round his notebook. And
Mrs. Parker was stooping.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I've dropped my glove. I'm so sorry to trouble you.
Down there, between the seats..."</p>

<p>The gramophone was affirming in tones there was no denying,
triumphant yet valedictory: <i>Dispersed are we; who have come
together. But,</i> the gramophone asserted, <i>let us retain
whatever made that harmony.</i></p>

<p>O let us, the audience echoed (stooping, peering, fumbling),
keep together. For there is joy, sweet joy, in company.</p>

<p><i>Dispersed are we,</i> the gramophone repeated.</p>

<p>And the audience turning saw the flaming windows, each daubed
with golden sun; and murmured: "Home, gentlemen; sweet..." yet
delayed a moment, seeing through the golden glory perhaps a crack
in the boiler; perhaps a hole in the carpet; and hearing, perhaps,
the daily drop of the daily bill.</p>

<p><i>Dispersed are we,</i> the gramophone informed them. And
dismissed them. So, straightening themselves for the last time,
each grasping, it might be a hat, or a stick or a pair of suede
gloves, for the last time they applauded Budge and Queen Bess; the
trees; the white road; Bolney Minster; and the Folly. One hailed
another, and they dispersed, across lawns, down paths, past the
house to the gravel-strewn crescent, where cars, push bikes and
cycles were crowded together.</p>

<p>Friends hailed each other in passing.</p>

<p>"I do think," someone was saying, "Miss Whatshername should have
come forward and not left it to the rector...After all, she wrote
it....I thought it brilliantly clever...O my dear, I thought it
utter bosh. Did <i>you</i> understand the meaning? Well, he said
she meant we all act all parts....He said, too, if I caught his
meaning, Nature takes part....Then there was the idiot....Also, why
leave out the Army, as my husband was saying, if it's history? And
if one spirit animates the whole, what about the aeroplanes?...Ah,
but you're being too exacting. After all, remember, it was only a
village play...For my part, I think they should have passed a vote
of thanks to the owners. When we had our pageant, the grass didn't
recover till autumn...Then we had tents....That's the man, Cobbet
of Cobbs Corner, who wins all the prizes at all the shows. I don't
myself admire prize flowers, nor yet prize dogs..."</p>

<p><i>Dispersed are we,</i> the gramophone triumphed, yet lamented,
<i>Dispersed are we...</i></p>

<p>"But you must remember," the old cronies chatted, "they had to
do it on the cheap. You can't get people, at this time o' year, to
rehearse. There's the hay, let alone the movies....What we need is
a centre. Something to bring us all together...The Brookes have
gone to Italy, in spite of everything. Rather rash?...If the worst
should come&mdash;let's hope it won't&mdash;they'd hire an
aeroplane, so they said....What amused me was old Streatfield,
feeling for his pouch. I like a man to be natural, not always on a
perch...Then those voices from the bushes...Oracles? You're
referring to the Greeks? Were the oracles, if I'm not being
irreverent, a foretaste of our own religion? Which is what?...Crepe
soles? That's so sensible...They last much longer and protect the
feet....But I was saying: can the Christian faith adapt itself? In
times like these...At Larting no one goes to church...There's the
dogs, there's the pictures....It's odd that science, so they tell
me, is making things (so to speak) more spiritual...The very latest
notion, so I'm told is, nothing's solid...There, you can get a
glimpse of the church through the trees...</p>

<p>"Mr. Umphelby! How nice to see you! Do come and dine...No, alas,
we're going back to town. The House is sitting...I was telling
them, the Brookes have gone to Italy. They've seen the volcano.
Most impressive, so they say&mdash;they were lucky&mdash;in
eruption. I agree&mdash;things look worse than ever on the
continent. And what's the channel, come to think of it, if they
mean to invade us? The aeroplanes, I didn't like to say it, made
one think....No, I thought it much too scrappy. Take the idiot. Did
she mean, so to speak, something hidden, the unconscious as they
call it? But why always drag in sex....It's true, there's a sense
in which we all, I admit, are savages still. Those women with red
nails. And dressing up&mdash;what's that? The old savage, I
suppose....That's the bell. Ding dong. Ding...Rather a cracked old
bell...And the mirrors! Reflecting us...I called that cruel. One
feels such a fool, caught unprotected...There's Mr. Streatfield,
going, I suppose to take the evening service. He'll have to hurry,
or he won't have time to change....He said she meant we all act.
Yes, but whose play? Ah, that's the question! And if we're left
asking questions, isn't it a failure, as a play? I must say I like
to feel sure if I go to the theatre, that I've grasped the
meaning...Or was that, perhaps, what she meant?...Ding dong.
Ding...that if we don't jump to conclusions, if you think, and I
think, perhaps one day, thinking differently, we shall think the
same?</p>

<p>"There's dear old Mr. Carfax...Can't we give you a lift, if you
don't mind playing bodkin? We were asking questions, Mr. Carfax,
about the play. The looking-glasses now&mdash;did they mean the
reflection is the dream; and the tune&mdash;was it Bach, Handel, or
no one in particular&mdash;is the truth? Or was it t'other way
about?</p>

<p>"Bless my soul, what a dither! Nobody seems to know one car from
another. That's why I have a mascot, a monkey...But I can't see
it...While we're waiting, tell me, did you feel when the shower
fell, someone wept for us all? There's a poem, <i>Tears tears
tears,</i> it begins. And goes on <i>O then the unloosened
ocean</i>...but I can't remember the rest.</p>

<p>"Then when Mr. Streatfield said: One spirit animates the
whole&mdash;the aeroplanes interrupted. That's the worst of playing
out of doors....Unless of course she meant that very thing...Dear
me, the parking arrangements are not what you might call
adequate...I shouldn't have expected either so many
Hispano-Suizas...That's a Rolls...That's a Bentley... That's the
new type of Ford....To return to the meaning&mdash;Are machines the
devil, or do they introduce a discord...Ding dong, ding...by means
of which we reach the final...Ding dong....Here's the car with the
monkey...Hop in...And good-bye, Mrs. Parker...Ring us up. Next time
we're down don't forget...Next time...Next time..."</p>

<p>The wheels scrurred on the gravel. The cars drove off.</p>

<p>The gramophone gurgled <i>Unity&mdash;Dispersity.</i> It gurgled
<i>Un...dis...</i> And ceased.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The little company who had come together at luncheon were left
standing on the terrace. The pilgrims had bruised a lane on the
grass. Also, the lawn would need a deal of clearing up. Tomorrow
the telephone would ring: "Did I leave my handbag?...A pair of
spectacles in a red leather case?...A little old brooch of no value
to anyone but me?" Tomorrow the telephone would ring. Now Mr.
Oliver said: "Dear lady," and, taking Mrs. Manresa's gloved hand in
his, pressed it, as if to say: "You have given me what you now take
from me." He would have liked to hold on for a moment longer to the
emeralds and rubies dug up, so people said, by thin Ralph Manresa
in his ragamuffin days. But alas, sunset light was unsympathetic to
her make-up; plated it looked, not deeply interfused. And he
dropped her hand; and she gave him an arch roguish twinkle, as if
to say&mdash;but the end of that sentence was cut short. For she
turned, and Giles stepped forward; and the light breeze which the
meteorologist had foretold fluttered her skirts; and she went, like
a goddess, buoyant, abundant, with flower-chained captives
following in her wake.</p>

<p>All were retreating, withdrawing and dispersing; and he was left
with the ash grown cold and no glow, no glow on the log. What word
expressed the sag at his heart, the effusion in his veins, as the
retreating Manresa, with Giles attendant, admirable woman, all
sensation, ripped the rag doll and let the sawdust stream from his
heart?</p>

<p>The old man made a guttural sound, and turned to the right. On
with the hobble, on with the limp, since the dance was over. He
strolled alone past the trees. It was here, early that very
morning, that he had destroyed the little boy's world. He had
popped out with his newspaper; the child had cried.</p>

<p>Down in the dell, past the lily pool, the actors were
undressing. He could see them among the brambles. In vests and
trousers; unhooking; buttoning up: on all fours; stuffing clothes
into cheap attach&eacute; cases; with silver swords, beards and
emeralds on the grass. Miss La Trobe in coat and skirt&mdash;too
short, for her legs were stout&mdash;battled with the billows of a
crinoline. He must respect the conventions. So he stopped, by the
pool. The water was opaque over the mud.</p>

<p>Then, coming up behind him, "Oughtn't we to thank her?" Lucy
asked him. She gave him a light pat on the arm.</p>

<p>How imperceptive her religion made her! The fumes of that
incense obscured the human heart. Skimming the surface, she ignored
the battle in the mud. After La Trobe had been excruciated by the
Rector's interpretation, by the maulings and the manglings of the
actors..."She don't want our thanks, Lucy," he said gruffly. What
she wanted, like that carp (something moved in the water) was
darkness in the mud; a whisky and soda at the pub; and coarse words
descending like maggots through the waters.</p>

<p>"Thank the actors, not the author," he said. "Or ourselves, the
audience."</p>

<p>He looked over his shoulder. The old lady, the indigenous, the
prehistoric, was being wheeled away by a footman. He rolled her
through the arch. Now the lawn was empty. The line of the roof, the
upright chimneys, rose hard and red against the blue of the
evening. The house emerged; the house that had been obliterated. He
was damned glad it was over&mdash;the scurry and the scuffle, the
rouge and the rings. He stooped and raised a peony that had shed
its petals. Solitude had come again. And reason and the lamplit
paper....But where was his dog? Chained in a kennel? The little
veins swelled with rage on his temples. He whistled. And here,
released by Candish, racing across the lawn with a fleck of foam on
the nostril, came his dog.</p>

<p>Lucy still gazed at the lily pool. "All gone," she murmured,
"under the leaves." Scared by shadows passing, the fish had
withdrawn. She gazed at the water. Perfunctorily she caressed her
cross. But her eyes went water searching, looking for fish. The
lilies were shutting; the red lily, the white lily, each on its
plate of leaf. Above, the air rushed; beneath was water. She stood
between two fluidities, caressing her cross. Faith required hours
of kneeling in the early morning. Often the delight of the roaming
eye seduced her&mdash;a sunbeam, a shadow. Now the jagged leaf at
the corner suggested, by its contours, Europe. There were other
leaves. She fluttered her eye over the surface, naming leaves
India, Africa, America. Islands of security, glossy and thick.</p>

<p>"Bart..." She spoke to him. She had meant to ask him about the
dragon-fly&mdash;couldn't the blue thread settle, if we destroyed
it here, then there? But he had gone into the house.</p>

<p>Then something moved in the water; her favourite fantail. The
golden orfe followed. Then she had a glimpse of silver&mdash;the
great carp himself, who came to the surface so very seldom. They
slid on, in and out between the stalks, silver; pink; gold;
splashed; streaked; pied.</p>

<p>"Ourselves," she murmured. And retrieving some glint of faith
from the grey waters, hopefully, without much help from reason, she
followed the fish; the speckled, streaked, and blotched; seeing in
that vision beauty, power, and glory in ourselves.</p>

<p>Fish had faith, she reasoned. They trust us because we've never
caught 'em. But her brother would reply: "That's greed." "Their
beauty!" she protested. "Sex," he would say. "Who makes sex
susceptible to beauty?" she would argue. He shrugged who? Why?
Silenced, she returned to her private vision; of beauty which is
goodness; the sea on which we float. Mostly impervious, but surely
every boat sometimes leaks?</p>

<p>He would carry the torch of reason till it went out in the
darkness of the cave. For herself, every morning, kneeling, she
protected her vision. Every night she opened the window and looked
at leaves against the sky. Then slept. Then the random ribbons of
birds' voices woke her.</p>

<p>The fish had come to the surface. She had nothing to give
them&mdash;not a crumb of bread. "Wait, my darlings," she addressed
them. She would trot into the house and ask Mrs. Sands for a
biscuit. Then a shadow fell. Off they flashed. How vexatious! Who
was it? Dear me, the young man whose name she had forgotten; not
Jones; nor Hodge...</p>

<p>Dodge had left Mrs. Manresa abruptly. All over the garden he had
been searching for Mrs. Swithin. Now he found her; and she had
forgotten his name.</p>

<p>"I'm William," he said. At that she revived, like a girl in a
garden in white, among roses, who came running to meet him&mdash;an
unacted part.</p>

<p>"I was going to get a biscuit&mdash;no, to thank the actors,"
she stumbled, virginal, blushing. Then she remembered her brother.
"My brother," she added "says one mustn't thank the author, Miss La
Trobe."</p>

<p>It was always "my brother...my brother" who rose from the depths
of her lily pool.</p>

<p>As for the actors, Hammond had detached his whiskers and was now
buttoning up his coat. When the chain was inserted between the
buttons he was off.</p>

<p>Only Miss La Trobe remained, bending over something in the
grass.</p>

<p>"The play's over," he said. "The actors have departed."</p>

<p>"And we mustn't, my brother says, thank the author," Mrs.
Swithin repeated, looking in the direction of Miss La Trobe.</p>

<p>"So I thank you," he said. He took her hand and pressed it.
Putting one thing with another, it was unlikely that they would
ever meet again.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The church bells always stopped, leaving you to ask: Won't there
be another note? Isa, half-way across the lawn, listened...Ding,
dong, ding...There was not going to be another note. The
congregation was assembled, on their knees, in the church. The
service was beginning. The play was over; swallows skimmed the
grass that had been the stage.</p>

<p>There was Dodge, the lip reader, her semblable, her conspirator,
a seeker like her after hidden faces. He was hurrying to rejoin
Mrs. Manresa who had gone in front with Giles&mdash;"the father of
my children," she muttered. The flesh poured over her, the hot,
nerve wired, now lit up, now dark as the grave physical body. By
way of healing the rusty fester of the poisoned dart she sought the
face that all day long she had been seeking. Preening and peering,
between backs, over shoulders, she had sought the man in grey. He
had given her a cup of tea at a tennis party; handed her, once, a
racquet. That was all. But, she was crying, had we met before the
salmon leapt like a bar of silver...had we met, she was crying. And
when her little boy came battling through the bodies in the Barn
"Had he been his son," she had muttered...In passing she stripped
the bitter leaf that grew, as it happened, outside the nursery
window. Old Man's Beard. Shrivelling the shreds in lieu of words,
for no words grow there, nor roses either, she swept past her
conspirator, her semblable, the seeker after vanished faces "like
Venus" he thought, making a rough translation, "to her prey ..."
and followed after.</p>

<p>Turning the corner, there was Giles attached to Mrs. Manresa.
She was standing at the door of her car. Giles had his foot on the
edge of the running board. Did they perceive the arrows about to
strike them?</p>

<p>"Jump in, Bill," Mrs. Manresa chaffed him.</p>

<p>And the wheels scurred on the gravel, and the car drove off.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>At last, Miss La Trobe could raise herself from her stooping
position. It had been prolonged to avoid attention. The bells had
stopped; the audience had gone; also the actors. She could
straighten her back. She could open her arms. She could say to the
world, You have taken my gift! Glory possessed her&mdash;for one
moment. But what had she given? A cloud that melted into the other
clouds on the horizon. It was in the giving that the triumph was.
And the triumph faded. Her gift meant nothing. If they had
understood her meaning; if they had known their parts; if the
pearls had been real and the funds illimitable&mdash;it would have
been a better gift. Now it had gone to join the others.</p>

<p>"A failure," she groaned, and stooped to put away the
records.</p>

<p>Then suddenly the starlings attacked the tree behind which she
had hidden. In one flock they pelted it like so many winged stones.
The whole tree hummed with the whizz they made, as if each bird
plucked a wire. A whizz, a buzz rose from the bird-buzzing,
bird-vibrant, bird-blackened tree. The tree became a rhapsody, a
quivering cacophony, a whizz and vibrant rapture, branches, leaves,
birds syllabling discordantly life, life, life, without measure,
without stop devouring the tree. Then up! Then off!</p>

<p>What interrupted? It was old Mrs. Chalmers, creeping through the
grass with a bunch of flowers&mdash;pinks apparently&mdash;to fill
the vase that stood on her husband's grave. In winter it was holly,
or ivy. In summer, a flower. It was she who had scared the
starlings. Now she passed.</p>

<p>Miss La Trobe nicked the lock and hoisted the heavy case of
gramophone records to her shoulder. She crossed the terrace and
stopped by the tree where the starlings had gathered. It was here
that she had suffered triumph, humiliation, ecstasy,
despair&mdash;for nothing. Her heels had ground a hole in the
grass.</p>

<p>It was growing dark. Since there were no clouds to trouble the
sky, the blue was bluer, the green greener. There was no longer a
view&mdash;no Folly, no spire of Bolney Minster. It was land
merely, no land in particular. She put down her case and stood
looking at the land. Then something rose to the surface.</p>

<p>"I should group them," she murmured, "here." It would be
midnight; there would be two figures, half concealed by a rock. The
curtain would rise. What would the first words be? The words
escaped her.</p>

<p>Again she lifted the heavy suit case to her shoulder. She strode
off across the lawn. The house was dormant; one thread of smoke
thickened against the trees. It was strange that the earth, with
all those flowers incandescent&mdash;the lilies, the roses, and
clumps of white flowers and bushes of burning green&mdash;should
still be hard. From the earth green waters seemed to rise over her.
She took her voyage away from the shore, and, raising her hand,
fumbled for the latch of the iron entrance gate.</p>

<p>She would drop her suit case in at the kitchen window, and then
go on up to the Inn. Since the row with the actress who had shared
her bed and her purse the need of drink had grown on her. And the
horror and the terror of being alone. One of these days she would
break&mdash;which of the village laws? Sobriety? Chastity? Or take
something that did not properly belong to her?</p>

<p>At the corner she ran into old Mrs. Chalmers returning from the
grave. The old woman looked down at the dead flowers she was
carrying and cut her. The women in the cottages with the red
geraniums always did that. She was an outcast. Nature had somehow
set her apart from her kind. Yet she had scribbled in the margin of
her manuscript: "I am the slave of my audience."</p>

<p>She thrust her suit case in at the scullery window and walked
on, till at the corner she saw the red curtain at the bar window.
There would be shelter; voices; oblivion. She turned the handle of
the public house door. The acrid smell of stale beer saluted her;
and voices talking. They stopped. They had been talking about Bossy
as they called her&mdash;it didn't matter. She took her chair and
looked through the smoke at a crude glass painting of a cow in a
stable; also at a cock and a hen. She raised her glass to her lips.
And drank. And listened. Words of one syllable sank down into the
mud. She drowsed; she nodded. The mud became fertile. Words rose
above the intolerably laden dumb oxen plodding through the mud.
Words without meaning&mdash;wonderful words.</p>

<p>The cheap clock ticked; smoke obscured the pictures. Smoke
became tart on the roof of her mouth. Smoke obscured the
earth-coloured jackets. She no longer saw them, yet they upheld
her, sitting arms akimbo with her glass before her. There was the
high ground at midnight; there the rock; and two scarcely
perceptible figures. Suddenly the tree was pelted with starlings.
She set down her glass. She heard the first words.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Down in the hollow, at Pointz Hall, beneath the trees, the table
was cleared in the dining room. Candish, with his curved brush had
swept the crumbs; had spared the petals and finally left the family
to dessert. The play was over, the strangers gone, and they were
alone&mdash;the family.</p>

<p>Still the play hung in the sky of the mind&mdash;moving,
diminishing, but still there. Dipping her raspberry in sugar, Mrs.
Swithin looked at the play. She said, popping the berry into her
mouth, "What did it mean?" and added: "The peasants; the kings; the
fool and" (she swallowed) "ourselves?"</p>

<p>They all looked at the play; Isa, Giles and Mr. Oliver. Each of
course saw something different. In another moment it would be
beneath the horizon, gone to join the other plays. Mr. Oliver,
holding out his cheroot said: "Too ambitious." And, lighting his
cheroot he added: "Considering her means."</p>

<p>It was drifting away to join the other clouds: becoming
invisible. Through the smoke Isa saw not the play but the audience
dispersing. Some drove; others cycled. A gate swung open. A car
swept up the drive to the red villa in the cornfields. Low hanging
boughs of acacia brushed the roof. Acacia petalled the car
arrived.</p>

<p>"The looking-glasses and the voices in the bushes," she
murmured. "What did she mean?"</p>

<p>"When Mr. Streatfield asked her to explain, she wouldn't," said
Mrs. Swithin.</p>

<p>Here, with its sheaf sliced in four, exposing a white cone,
Giles offered his wife a banana. She refused it. He stubbed his
match on the plate. Out it went with a little fizz in the raspberry
juice.</p>

<p>"We should be thankful," said Mrs. Swithin, folding her napkin,
"for the weather, which was perfect, save for one shower."</p>

<p>Here she rose, Isa followed her across the hall to the big
room.</p>

<p>They never pulled the curtains till it was too dark to see, nor
shut the windows till it was too cold. Why shut out the day before
it was over? The flowers were still bright; the birds chirped. You
could see more in the evening often when nothing interrupted, when
there was no fish to order, no telephone to answer. Mrs. Swithin
stopped by the great picture of Venice&mdash;school of Canaletto.
Possibly in the hood of the gondola there was a little
figure&mdash;a woman, veiled; or a man?</p>

<p>Isa, sweeping her sewing from the table, sank, her knee doubled,
into the chair by the window. Within the shell of the room she
overlooked the summer night. Lucy returned from her voyage into the
picture and stood silent. The sun made each pane of her glasses
shine red. Silver sparkled on her black shawl. For a moment she
looked like a tragic figure from another play.</p>

<p>Then she spoke in her usual voice. "We made more this year than
last, he said. But then last year it rained."</p>

<p>"This year, last year, next year, never..." Isa murmured. Her
hand burnt in the sun on the window sill. Mrs. Swithin took her
knitting from the table.</p>

<p>"Did you feel," she asked "what he said: we act different parts
but are the same?"</p>

<p>"Yes," Isa answered. "No," she added. It was Yes, No. Yes, yes,
yes, the tide rushed out embracing. No, no no, it contracted. The
old boot appeared on the shingle.</p>

<p>"Orts, scraps and fragments," she quoted what she remembered of
the vanishing play.</p>

<p>Lucy had just opened her lips to reply, and had laid her hand on
her cross caressingly, when the gentlemen came in. She made her
little chirruping sound of welcome. She shuffled her feet to clear
a space. But in fact there was more space than was needed, and
great hooded chairs.</p>

<p>They sat down, ennobled both of them by the setting sun. Both
had changed. Giles now wore the black coat and white tie of the
professional classes, which needed&mdash;Isa looked down at his
feet&mdash;patent leather pumps. "Our representative, our
spokesman," she sneered. Yet he was extraordinarily handsome. "The
father of my children, whom I love and hate." Love and
hate&mdash;how they tore her asunder! Surely it was time someone
invented a new plot, or that the author came out from the
bushes...</p>

<p>Here Candish came in. He brought the second post on a silver
salver. There were letters; bills; and the morning paper&mdash;the
paper that obliterated the day before. Like a fish rising to a
crumb of biscuit, Bartholomew snapped at the paper. Giles slit the
flap of an apparently business document. Lucy read a criss-cross
from an old friend at Scarborough. Isa had only bills.</p>

<p>The usual sounds reverberated through the shell; Sands making up
the fire; Candish stoking the boiler. Isa had done with her bills.
Sitting in the shell of the room she watched the pageant fade. The
flowers flashed before they faded. She watched them flash.</p>

<p>The paper crackled. The second hand jerked on. M. Daladier had
pegged down the franc. The girl had gone skylarking with the
troopers. She had screamed. She had hit him....What then?</p>

<p>When Isa looked at the flowers again, the flowers had faded.</p>

<p>Bartholomew flicked on the reading lamp. The circle of the
readers, attached to white papers, was lit up. There in that hollow
of the sun-baked field were congregated the grasshopper, the ant,
and the beetle, rolling pebbles of sun-baked earth through the
glistening stubble. In that rosy corner of the sun-baked field
Bartholomew, Giles and Lucy polished and nibbled and broke off
crumbs. Isa watched them.</p>

<p>Then the newspaper dropped.</p>

<p>"Finished?" said Giles, taking it from his father.</p>

<p>The old man relinquished his paper. He basked. One hand
caressing the dog rippled folds of skin towards the collar.</p>

<p>The clock ticked. The house gave little cracks as if it were
very brittle, very dry. Isa's hand on the window felt suddenly
cold. Shadow had obliterated the garden. Roses had withdrawn for
the night.</p>

<p>Mrs. Swithin folding her letter murmured to Isa: "I looked in
and saw the babies, sound asleep, under the paper roses."</p>

<p>"Left over from the coronation," Bartholomew muttered, half
asleep.</p>

<p>"But we needn't have been to all that trouble with the
decorations," Lucy added, "for it didn't rain this year."</p>

<p>"This year, last year, next year, never," Isa murmured.</p>

<p>"Tinker, tailor, soldier, sailor," Bartholomew echoed. He was
talking in his sleep.</p>

<p>Lucy slipped her letter into its envelope. It was time to read
now, her Outline of History. But she had lost her place. She turned
the pages looking at pictures&mdash;mammoths, mastodons,
prehistoric birds. Then she found the page where she had
stopped.</p>

<p>The darkness increased. The breeze swept round the room. With a
little shiver Mrs. Swithin drew her sequin shawl about her
shoulders. She was too deep in the story to ask for the window to
be shut. "England," she was reading, "was then a swamp. Thick
forests covered the land. On the top of their matted branches birds
sang..."</p>

<p>The great square of the open window showed only sky now. It was
drained of light, severe, stone cold. Shadows fell. Shadows crept
over Bartholomew's high forehead; over his great nose. He looked
leafless, spectral, and his chair monumental. As a dog shudders its
skin, his skin shuddered. He rose, shook himself, glared at
nothing, and stalked from the room. They heard the dog's paws
padding on the carpet behind him.</p>

<p>Lucy turned the page, quickly, guiltily, like a child who will
be told to go to bed before the end of the chapter.</p>

<p>"Prehistoric man," she read, "half-human, half-ape, roused
himself from his semi-crouching position and raised great
stones."</p>

<p>She slipped the letter from Scarborough between the pages to
mark the end of the chapter, rose, smiled, and tiptoed silently out
of the room.</p>

<p>The old people had gone up to bed. Giles crumpled the newspaper
and turned out the light. Left alone together for the first time
that day, they were silent. Alone, enmity was bared; also love.
Before they slept, they must fight; after they had fought, they
would embrace. From that embrace another life might be born. But
first they must fight, as the dog fox fights with the vixen, in the
heart of darkness, in the fields of night.</p>

<p>Isa let her sewing drop. The great hooded chairs had become
enormous. And Giles too. And Isa too against the window. The window
was all sky without colour. The house had lost its shelter. It was
night before roads were made, or houses. It was the night that
dwellers in caves had watched from some high place among rocks.</p>

<p>Then the curtain rose. They spoke.</p>
