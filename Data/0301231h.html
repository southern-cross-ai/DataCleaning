<h3>DEDICATION<br>
<i>To a Young Gentleman of Eton College</i></h3>

<p class="dedication"><SPAN CLASS="smcap">Honoured Sir</SPAN>,</p>

<p class="dedication">On your last birthday a well-meaning godfather presented you with a volume of mine, since you had been heard on occasion to
express approval of my works. The book dealt with a somewhat arid
branch of historical research, and it did not please you. You
wrote to me, I remember, complaining that I had "let you down,"
and summoning me, as I valued your respect, to "pull myself
together." In particular you demanded to hear more of the doings
of Richard Hannay, a gentleman for whom you professed a liking.
I, too, have a liking for Sir Richard, and when I met him the
other day (he is now a country neighbour) I observed that his
left hand had been considerably mauled, an injury which I knew
had not been due to the War. He was so good as to tell me the
tale of an unpleasant business in which he had recently been
engaged, and to give me permission to retell it for your benefit.
Sir Richard took a modest pride in the affair, because from first
to last it had been a pure contest of wits, without recourse to
those more obvious methods of strife with which he is familiar.
So I herewith present it to you, in the hope that in the eyes of
you and your friends it may atone for certain other writings of
mine with which you have been afflicted by those in
authority.</p>

<h1>DOCTOR GREENSLADE THEORISES</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>That evening, I remember, as I came up through the Mill
Meadow, I was feeling peculiarly happy and contented. It was
still mid-March, one of those spring days when noon is like May,
and only the cold pearly haze at sunset warns a man that he is
not done with winter. The season was absurdly early, for the
blackthorn was in flower and the hedge roots were full of
primroses. The partridges were paired, the rooks were well on
with their nests, and the meadows were full of shimmering grey
flocks of fieldfares on their way north. I put up half a dozen
snipe on the boggy edge of the stream, and in the bracken in
Sturn Wood I thought I saw a woodcock, and hoped that the birds
might nest with us this year, as they used to do long ago. It was
jolly to see the world coming to life again, and to remember that
this patch of England was my own, and all these wild things, so
to speak, members of my little household.</p>

<p>As I say, I was in a very contented mood, for I had found
something I had longed for all my days. I had bought Fosse Manor
just after the War as a wedding present for Mary, and for two and
a half years we had been settled there. My son, Peter John, was
rising fifteen months, a thoughtful infant, as healthy as a young
colt and as comic as a terrier puppy. Even Mary's anxious eye
could scarcely detect in him any symptoms of decline. But the
place wanted a lot of looking to, for it had run wild during the
War, and the woods had to be thinned, gates and fences repaired,
new drains laid, a ram put in to supplement the wells, a heap of
thatching to be done, and the garden borders to be brought back
to cultivation. I had got through the worst of it, and as I came
out of the Home Wood on to the lower lawns and saw the old stone
gables that the monks had built, I felt that I was anchored at
last in the pleasantest kind of harbour.</p>

<p>There was a pile of letters on the table in the hall, but I
let them be, for I was not in the mood for any communication with
the outer world. As I was having a hot bath Mary kept giving me
the news through her bedroom door. Peter John had been raising
Cain over a first tooth; the new shorthorn cow was drying off;
old George Whaddon had got his granddaughter back from service;
there was a new brood of runner-ducks; there was a missel-thrush
building in the box hedge by the lake. A chronicle of small beer,
you will say, but I was by a long chalk more interested in it
than in what might be happening in Parliament or Russia or the
Hindu Kush. The fact is I was becoming such a mossback that I had
almost stopped reading the papers. Many a day <i>The Times</i>
would remain unopened, for Mary never looked at anything but the
first page to see who was dead or married. Not that I didn't read
a lot, for I used to spend my evenings digging into county
history, and learning all I could about the old fellows who had
been my predecessors. I liked to think that I lived in a place
that had been continuously inhabited for a thousand years.
Cavalier and Roundhead had fought over the countryside, and I was
becoming a considerable authority on their tiny battles. That was
about the only interest I had left in soldiering.</p>

<p>As we went downstairs, I remember we stopped to look out of
the long staircase window which showed a segment of lawn, a
corner of the lake, and through a gap in the woods a vista of
green downland. Mary squeezed my arm. "What a blessed country,"
she said. "Dick, did you ever dream of such peace? We're lucky,
lucky people."</p>

<p>Then suddenly her face changed in that way she has and grew
very grave. I felt a little shiver run along her arm.</p>

<p>"It's too good and beloved to last," she whispered. "Sometimes
I am afraid."</p>

<p>"Nonsense," I laughed. "What's going to upset it? I don't
believe in being afraid of happiness." I knew very well, of
course, that Mary couldn't be afraid of anything.</p>

<p>She laughed too. "All the same I've got what the Greek called
<i>aidos.</i> You don't know what that means, you old savage. It
means that you feel you must walk humbly and delicately to
propitiate the Fates. I wish I knew how."</p>

<p>She walked too delicately, for she missed the last step and
our descent ended in an undignified shuffle right into the arms
of Dr. Greenslade.</p>

<p>Paddock--I had got Paddock back after the War and he was now
my butler--was helping the doctor out of his ulster, and I saw by
the satisfied look on the latter's face that he was through with
his day's work and meant to stay to dinner. Here I had better
introduce Tom Greenslade, for of all my recent acquaintances he
was the one I had most taken to. He was a long lean fellow with a
stoop in his back from bending over the handles of
motor-bicycles, with reddish hair, and the greeny-blue eyes and
freckled skin that often accompany that kind of hair. From his
high cheek bones and his colouring you would have set him down as
a Scotsman, but as a matter of fact he came from
Devonshire--Exmoor, I think, though he had been so much about the
world that he had almost forgotten where he was raised. I have
travelled a bit, but nothing to Greenslade. He had started as a
doctor in a whaling ship. Then he had been in the South African
War and afterwards a temporary magistrate up Lydenburg way. He
soon tired of that, and was for a long spell in Uganda and German
East, where he became rather a swell on tropical diseases, and
nearly perished through experimenting on himself with fancy
inoculations. Then he was in South America, where he had a good
practice in Valparaiso, and then in the Malay States, where he
made a bit of money in the rubber boom. There was a gap of three
years after that when he was wandering about Central Asia, partly
with a fellow called Duckett exploring Northern Mongolia, and
partly in Chinese Tibet hunting for new flowers, for he was mad
about botany. He came home in the summer of 1914, meaning to do
some laboratory research work, but the War swept him up and he
went to France as M.O. of a territorial battalion. He got wounded
of course, and after a spell in hospital went out to Mesopotamia,
where he stayed till the Christmas of 1918, sweating hard at his
job but managing to tumble into a lot of varied adventures, for
he was at Baku with Dunsterville and got as far as Tashkend,
where the Bolsheviks shut him up for a fortnight in a bath-house.
During the War he had every kind of sickness, for he missed no
experience, but nothing seemed to damage permanently his whipcord
physique. He told me that his heart and lungs and blood pressure
were as good as a lad's of twenty-one, though by this time he was
on the wrong side of forty.</p>

<p>But when the War was over he hankered for a quiet life, so he
bought a practice in the deepest and greenest corner of England.
He said his motive was the same as that which in the rackety
Middle Ages made men retire into monasteries; he wanted quiet and
leisure to consider his soul. Quiet he may have found, but
uncommon little leisure, for I never heard of a country doctor
that toiled at his job as he did. He would pay three visits a day
to a panel patient, which shows the kind of fellow he was; and he
would be out in the small hours at the birth of a gipsy child
under a hedge. He was a first-class man in his profession, and
kept abreast of it, but doctoring was only one of a thousand
interests. I never met a chap with such an insatiable curiosity
about everything in heaven and earth. He lived in two rooms in a
farmhouse some four miles from us, and I dare say he had several
thousand books about him. All day, and often half the night, he
would scour the country in his little run-about car, and yet,
when he would drop in to see me and have a drink after maybe
twenty visits, he was as full of beans as if he had just got out
of bed. Nothing came amiss to him in talk--birds, beasts,
flowers, books, politics, religion--everything in the world
except himself. He was the best sort of company, for behind all
his quickness and cleverness, you felt that he was solid
bar-gold. But for him I should have taken root in the soil and
put out shoots, for I have a fine natural talent for vegetating.
Mary strongly approved of him and Peter John adored him.</p>

<p>He was in tremendous spirits that evening, and for once in a
way gave us reminiscences of his past. He told us about the
people he badly wanted to see again; an Irish Spaniard up in the
north of the Argentine who had for cattle-men a most murderous
brand of native from the mountains, whom he used to keep in good
humour by arranging fights every Sunday, he himself taking on the
survivor with his fists and always knocking him out; a Scots
trader from Hankow who had turned Buddhist priest and intoned his
prayers with a strong Glasgow accent; and most of all a Malay
pirate, who, he said, was a sort of St. Francis with beasts,
though a perfect Nero with his fellow-men. That took him to
Central Asia, and he observed that if ever he left England again
he would make for those parts, since they were the refuge of all
the superior rascality of creation. He had a notion that
something very odd might happen there in the long run. "Think of
it!" he cried. "All the places with names like spells--Bokhara,
Samarkand--run by seedy little gangs of communist Jews. It won't
go on for ever. Some day a new Genghis Khan or a Timour will be
thrown up out of the maelstrom. Europe is confused enough, but
Asia is ancient Chaos."</p>

<p>After dinner we sat round the fire in the library, which I had
modelled on Sir Walter Bullivant's room in his place on the
Kennet, as I had promised myself seven years ago. I had meant it
for my own room where I could write and read and smoke, but Mary
would not allow it. She had a jolly panelled sitting-room of her
own upstairs, which she rarely entered; but though I chased her
away, she was like a hen in a garden and always came back, so
that presently she had staked out a claim on the other side of my
writing-table. I have the old hunter's notion of order, but it
was useless to strive with Mary, so now my desk was littered with
her letters and needlework, and Peter John's toys and
picture-books were stacked in the cabinet where I kept my
fly-books, and Peter John himself used to make a kraal every
morning inside an up-turned stool on the hearth-rug.</p>

<p>It was a cold night and very pleasant by the fireside, where
some scented logs from an old pear-tree were burning. The doctor
picked up a detective novel I had been reading, and glanced at
the title-page.</p>

<p>"I can read most things," he said, "but it beats me how you
waste time over such stuff. These shockers are too easy, Dick.
You could invent better ones for yourself."</p>

<p>"Not I. I call that a dashed ingenious yarn. I can't think how
the fellow does it."</p>

<p>"Quite simple. The author writes the story inductively, and
the reader follows it deductively. Do you see what I mean?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit," I replied.</p>

<p>"Look here. I want to write a shocker, so I begin by fixing on
one or two facts which have no sort of obvious connection."</p>

<p>"For example?"</p>

<p>"Well, imagine anything you like. Let us take three things a
long way apart--" He paused for a second to consider--"say, an
old blind woman spinning in the Western Highlands, a barn in a
Norwegian <i>saeter,</i> and a little curiosity shop in North
London kept by a Jew with a dyed beard. Not much connection
between the three? You invent a connection--simple enough if you
have any imagination, and you weave all three into the yarn. The
reader, who knows nothing about the three at the start, is
puzzled and intrigued and, if the story is well arranged, finally
satisfied. He is pleased with the ingenuity of the solution, for
he doesn't realise that the author fixed upon the solution first,
and then invented a problem to suit it."</p>

<p>"I see," I said. "You've gone and taken the gilt off my
favourite light reading. I won't be able any more to marvel at
the writer's cleverness."</p>

<p>"I've another objection to the stuff--it's not ingenious
enough, or rather it doesn't take account of the infernal
complexity of life. It might have been all right twenty years
ago, when most people argued and behaved fairly logically. But
they don't nowadays. Have you ever realised, Dick, the amount of
stark craziness that the War has left in the world?"</p>

<p>Mary, who was sitting sewing under a lamp, raised her head and
laughed.</p>

<p>Greenslade's face had become serious. "I can speak about it
frankly here, for you two are almost the only completely sane
people I know. Well, as a pathologist, I'm fairly staggered. I
hardly meet a soul who hasn't got some slight kink in his brain
as a consequence of the last seven years. With most people it's
rather a pleasant kink--they're less settled in their grooves,
and they see the comic side of things quicker, and are readier
for adventure. But with some it's <i>pukka</i> madness, and that
means crime. Now, how are you going to write detective stories
about that kind of world on the old lines? You can take nothing
for granted, as you once could, and your argus-eyed,
lightning-brained expert has nothing solid with which to build
his foundations."</p>

<p>I observed that the poor old War seemed to be getting blamed
for a good deal that I was taught in my childhood was due to
original sin.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm not questioning your Calvinism. Original sin is
always there, but the meaning of civilisation was that we had got
it battened down under hatches, whereas now it's getting its head
up. But it isn't only sin. It's a dislocation of the mechanism of
human reasoning, a general loosening of screws. Oddly enough, in
spite of parrot-talk about shell-shock, the men who fought suffer
less from it on the whole than other people. The classes that
shirked the War are the worst--you see it in Ireland. Every
doctor nowadays has got to be a bit of a mental pathologist. As I
say, you can hardly take anything for granted, and if you want
detective stories that are not childish fantasy you'll have to
invent a new kind. Better try your hand, Dick."</p>

<p>"Not I. I'm a lover of sober facts."</p>

<p>"But, hang it, man, the facts are no longer sober. I could
tell you--" He paused and I was expecting a yarn, but he changed
his mind.</p>

<p>"Take all this chatter about psycho-analysis. There's nothing
very new in the doctrine, but people are beginning to work it out
into details, and making considerable asses of themselves in the
process. It's an awful thing when a scientific truth becomes the
quarry of the half-baked. But as I say, the fact of the
subconscious self is as certain as the existence of lungs and
arteries."</p>

<p>"I don't believe that Dick has any subconscious self," said
Mary.</p>

<p>"Oh yes, he has. Only, people who have led his kind of life
have their ordinary self so well managed and disciplined--their
wits so much about them, as the phrase goes--that the
subconscious rarely gets a show. But I bet if Dick took to
thinking about his soul, which he never does, he would find some
queer corners. Take my own case." He turned towards me so that I
had a full view of his candid eyes and hungry cheek-bones which
looked prodigious in the firelight. "I belong more or less to the
same totem as you, but I've long been aware that I possessed a
most curious kind of subconsciousness. I've a good memory and
fair powers of observation, but they're nothing to those of my
subconscious self. Take any daily incident. I see and hear, say,
about a twentieth part of the details and remember about a
hundredth part--that is, assuming that there is nothing special
to stimulate my interest. But my subconscious self sees and hears
practically everything, and remembers most of it. Only I can't
use the memory, for I don't know that I've got it, and can't call
it into being when I wish. But every now and then something
happens to turn on the tap of the subconscious, and a thin
trickle comes through. I find myself sometimes remembering names
I was never aware of having heard, and little incidents and
details I had never consciously noticed. Imagination, you will
say; but it isn't, for everything that that inner memory provides
is exactly true. I've tested it. If I could only find some way of
tapping it at will, I should be an uncommonly efficient fellow.
Incidentally I should become the first scientist of the age, for
the trouble with investigation and experiment is that the
ordinary brain does not observe sufficiently keenly or remember
the data sufficiently accurately."</p>

<p>"That's interesting," I said. "I'm not at all certain I
haven't noticed the same thing in myself. But what has that to do
with the madness that you say is infecting the world?"</p>

<p>"Simply this. The barriers between the conscious and the
subconscious have always been pretty stiff in the average man.
But now with the general loosening of screws they are growing
shaky and the two worlds are getting mixed. It is like two
separate tanks of fluid, where the containing wall has worn into
holes, and one is percolating into the other. The result is
confusion, and, if the fluids are of a certain character,
explosions. That is why I say that you can't any longer take the
clear psychology of most civilised human beings for granted.
Something is welling up from primeval deeps to muddy it."</p>

<p>"I don't object to that," I said. "We've overdone
civilisation, and personally I'm all for a little barbarism. I
want a simpler world."</p>

<p>"Then you won't get it," said Greenslade. He had become very
serious now, and was looking towards Mary as he talked. "The
civilised is far simpler than the primeval. All history has been
an effort to make definitions, clear rules of thought, clear
rules of conduct, solid sanctions, by which we can conduct our
life. These are the work of the conscious self. The subconscious
is an elementary and lawless thing. If it intrudes on life two
results must follow. There will be a weakening of the power of
reasoning, which after all is the thing that brings men nearest
to the Almighty. And there will be a failure of nerve."</p>

<p>I got up to get a light, for I was beginning to feel depressed
by the doctor's diagnosis of our times. I don't know whether he
was altogether serious, for he presently started on fishing,
which was one of his many hobbies. There was very fair dry-fly
fishing to be had in our little river, but I had taken a
deer-forest with Archie Roylance for the season, and Greenslade
was coming up with me to try his hand at salmon. There had been
no sea-trout the year before in the West Highlands, and we fell
to discussing the cause. He was ready with a dozen theories, and
we forgot about the psychology of mankind in investigating the
uncanny psychology of fish. After that Mary sang to us, for I
considered any evening a failure without that, and at half-past
ten the doctor got into his old ulster and departed.</p>

<p>As I smoked my last pipe I found my thoughts going over
Greenslade's talk. I had found a snug harbour, but how yeasty the
waters seemed to be outside the bar and how erratic the tides! I
wondered if it wasn't shirking to be so comfortable in a
comfortless world. Then I reflected that I was owed a little
peace, for I had had a roughish life. But Mary's words kept
coming back to me about "walking delicately." I considered that
my present conduct filled that bill, for I was mighty thankful
for my mercies and in no way inclined to tempt Providence by
complacency.</p>

<p>Going up to bed, I noticed my neglected letters on the hall
table. I turned them over and saw that they were mostly bills and
receipts or tradesmen's circulars. But there was one addressed in
a handwriting that I knew, and as I looked at it I experienced a
sudden sinking of the heart. It was from Lord Artinswell--Sir
Walter Bullivant, as was--who had now retired from the Foreign
Office, and was living at his place on the Kennet. He and I
occasionally corresponded about farming and fishing, but I had a
premonition that this was something different. I waited for a
second or two before I opened it.</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>"MY DEAR DICK,</p>

<p>"This note is in the nature of a warning. In the next day or
two you will be asked, nay pressed, to undertake a troublesome
piece of business. I am not responsible for the request, but I
know of it. If you consent, it will mean the end for a time of
your happy vegetable life. I don't want to influence you one way
or another; I only give you notice of what is coming in order
that you may adjust your mind and not be taken by surprise. My
love to Mary and the son.</p>

<p>"Yours ever,</p>

<p>"A."</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>That was all. I had lost my trepidation and felt very angry.
Why couldn't the fools let me alone? As I went upstairs I vowed
that not all the cajolery in the world would make me budge an
inch from the path I had set myself. I had done enough for the
public service and other people's interests, and it was jolly
well time that I should be allowed to attend to my own.</p>

</center>

<p> </p>

<p>There is an odour about a country-house which I love better
than any scent in the world. Mary used to say it was a mixture of
lamp and dog and wood-smoke, but at Fosse, where there was
electric light and no dogs indoors, I fancy it was wood-smoke,
tobacco, the old walls, and wafts of the country coming in at the
windows. I liked it best in the morning, when there was a touch
in it of breakfast cooking, and I used to stand at the top of the
staircase and sniff it as I went to my bath. But on the morning I
write of I could take no pleasure in it; indeed it seemed to
tantalise me with a vision of country peace which had somehow got
broken. I couldn't get that confounded letter out of my head.
When I read it I had torn it up in disgust, but I found myself
going down in my dressing-gown, to the surprise of a housemaid,
piecing together the fragments from the waste-paper basket, and
reading it again. This time I flung the bits into the new-kindled
fire.</p>

<p>I was perfectly resolved that I would have nothing to do with
Bullivant or any of his designs, but all the same I could not
recapture the serenity which yesterday had clothed me like a
garment. I was down to breakfast before Mary, and had finished
before she appeared. Then I lit my pipe and started on my usual
tour of my domain, but nothing seemed quite the same. It was a
soft fresh morning with no frost, and the scillas along the edge
of the lake were like bits of summer sky. The moor-hens were
building, and the first daffodils were out in the rough grass
below the clump of Scots firs, and old George Whaddon was nailing
up rabbit wire and whistling through his two remaining teeth, and
generally the world was as clear and jolly as spring could make
it. But I didn't feel any more that it was really mine, only that
I was looking on at a pretty picture. Something had happened to
jar the harmony between it and my mind, and I cursed Bullivant
and his intrusions.</p>

<p>I returned by the front of the house, and there at the door to
my surprise stood a big touring Rolls-Royce. Paddock met me in
the hall and handed me a card, on which I read the name of Mr.
Julius Victor.</p>

<p>I knew it, of course, for the name of one of the richest men
in the world, the American banker who had done a lot of Britain's
financial business in the War, and was in Europe now at some
international conference. I remembered that Blenkiron, who didn't
like his race, had once described him to me as "the whitest Jew
since the Apostle Paul."</p>

<p>In the library I found a tall man standing by the window
looking out at our view. He turned as I entered, and I saw a thin
face with a neatly trimmed grey beard, and the most worried eyes
I have ever seen in a human countenance. Everything about him was
spruce and dapper--his beautifully-cut grey suit, his black tie
and pink pearl pin, his blue-and-white linen, his exquisitely
polished shoes. But the eyes were so wild and anxious that he
looked dishevelled.</p>

<p>"General," he said, and took a step towards me.</p>

<p>We shook hands and I made him sit down.</p>

<p>"I have dropped the 'General,' if you don't mind," I said.
"What I want to know is, have you had breakfast?"</p>

<p>He shook his head. "I had a cup of coffee on the road. I do
not eat in the morning."</p>

<p>"Where have you come from, sir?" I asked.</p>

<p>"From London."</p>

<p>Well, London is seventy-six miles from us, so he must have
started early. I looked curiously at him, and he got out of his
chair and began to stride about.</p>

<p>"Sir Richard," he said, in a low pleasant voice which I could
imagine convincing any man he tried it on, "you are a soldier and
a man of the world and will pardon my unconventionality. My
business is too urgent to waste time on apologies. I have heard
of you from common friends as a man of exceptional resource and
courage. I have been told in confidence something of your record.
I have come to implore your help in a desperate emergency."</p>

<p>I passed him a box of cigars, and he took one and lit it
carefully. I could see his long slim fingers trembling as he held
the match.</p>

<p>"You may have heard of me," he went on. "I am a very rich man,
and my wealth has given me power, so that Governments honour me
with their confidence. I am concerned in various important
affairs, and it would be false modesty to deny that my word is
weightier than that of many Prime Ministers. I am labouring, Sir
Richard, to secure peace in the world, and consequently I have
enemies, all those who would perpetuate anarchy and war. My life
has been more than once attempted, but that is nothing. I am well
guarded. I am not, I think, more of a coward than other men, and
I am prepared to take my chance. But now I have been attacked by
a subtler weapon, and I confess I have no defence. I had a son,
who died ten years ago at college. My only other child is my
daughter, Adela, a girl of nineteen. She came to Europe just
before Christmas, for she was to be married in Paris in April. A
fortnight ago she was hunting with friends in
Northamptonshire--the place is called Rushford Court. On the
morning of the 8th of March she went for a walk to Rushford
village to send a telegram, and was last seen passing through the
lodge gates at twenty-minutes past eleven. She has not been seen
since."</p>

<p>"Good God!" I exclaimed, and rose from my chair. Mr. Victor
was looking out of the window, so I walked to the other end of
the room and fiddled with the books on a shelf. There was silence
for a second or two, till I broke it.</p>

<p>"Do you suppose it is loss of memory?" I asked.</p>

<p>"No," he said. "It is not loss of memory. I know--we have
proof--that she has been kidnapped by those whom I call my
enemies. She is being held as a hostage."</p>

<p>"You know she is alive?"</p>

<p>He nodded, for his voice was choking again. "There is evidence
which points to a very deep and devilish plot. It may be revenge,
but I think it more likely to be policy. Her captors hold her as
security for their own fate."</p>

<p>"Has Scotland Yard done nothing?"</p>

<p>"Everything that man could do, but the darkness only grows
thicker."</p>

<p>"Surely it has not been in the papers. I don't read them
carefully but I could scarcely miss a thing like that."</p>

<p>"It has been kept out of the papers--for a reason which you
will be told."</p>

<p>"Mr. Victor," I said, "I'm most deeply sorry for you. Like
you, I've just the one child, and if anything of that kind
happened to him I should go mad. But I shouldn't take too gloomy
a view. Miss Adela will turn up all right, and none the worse,
though you may have to pay through the nose for it. I expect it's
ordinary blackmail and ransom."</p>

<p>"No," he said very quietly. "It is not blackmail, and if it
were, I would not pay the ransom demanded. Believe me, Sir
Richard, it is a very desperate affair. More, far more is
involved than the fate of one young girl. I am not going to touch
on that side, for the full story will be told you later by one
better equipped to tell it. But the hostage is my daughter, my
only child. I have come to beg your assistance in the search for
her."</p>

<p>"But I'm no good at looking for things," I stammered. "I'm
most awfully sorry for you, but I don't see how I can help. If
Scotland Yard is at a loss, it's not likely that an utter novice
like me would succeed."</p>

<p>"But you have a different kind of imagination and a rarer kind
of courage. I know what you have done before, Sir Richard. I tell
you you are my last hope."</p>

<p>I sat down heavily and groaned. "I can't begin to explain to
you the bottomless futility of your idea. It is quite true that
in the War I had some queer jobs and was lucky enough to bring
some of them off. But, don't you see, I was a soldier then, under
orders, and it didn't greatly signify whether I lost my life from
a crump in the trenches or from a private bullet on the
backstairs. I was in the mood for any risk, and my wits were
strung up and unnaturally keen. But that's all done with. I'm in
a different mood now and my mind is weedy and grass-grown. I've
settled so deep into the country that I'm just an ordinary
hayseed farmer. If I took a hand--which I certainly won't--I'd
only spoil the game."</p>

<p>Mr. Victor stood looking at me intently. I thought for a
moment he was going to offer me money, and rather hoped he would,
for that would have stiffened me like a ramrod, though it would
have spoiled the good notion I had of him. The thought may have
crossed his mind, but he was clever enough to reject it.</p>

<p>"I don't agree with a word you say about yourself, and I'm
accustomed to size up men. I appeal to you as a Christian
gentleman to help me to recover my child. I am not going to press
that appeal, for I have already taken up enough of your time. My
London address is on my card. Good-bye, Sir Richard, and believe
me, I am very grateful to you for receiving me so kindly."</p>

<p>In five minutes he and his Rolls-Royce had gone, and I was
left in a miserable mood of shame-faced exasperation. I realised
how Mr. Julius Victor had made his fame. He knew how to handle
men, for if he had gone on pleading he would only have riled me,
whereas he had somehow managed to leave it all to my honour, and
thoroughly unsettle my mind.</p>

<p>I went for a short walk, cursing the world at large, sometimes
feeling horribly sorry for that unfortunate father, sometimes
getting angry because he had tried to mix me up in his affairs.
Of course I would not touch the thing; I couldn't; it was
manifestly impossible; I had neither the capacity nor the
inclination. I was not a professional rescuer of distressed
ladies whom I did not know from Eve.</p>

<p>A man, I told myself, must confine his duties to his own
circle of friends, except when his country has need of him. I was
over forty, and had a wife and a young son to think of; besides,
I had chosen a retired life, and had the right to have my choice
respected. But I can't pretend that I was comfortable. A hideous
muddy wave from the outer world had come to disturb my little
sheltered pool. I found Mary and Peter John feeding the swans,
and couldn't bear to stop and play with them. The gardeners were
digging in sulphates about the fig trees on the south wall, and
wanted directions about the young chestnuts in the nursery; the
keeper was lying in wait for me in the stable-yard for
instructions about a new batch of pheasants' eggs, and the groom
wanted me to look at the hocks of Mary's cob. But I simply
couldn't talk to any of them. These were the things I loved, but
for a moment the gilt was off them, and I would let them wait
till I felt better. In a very bad temper I returned to the
library.</p>

<p>I hadn't been there two minutes when I heard the sound of a
car on the gravel. "Let 'em all come," I groaned, and I wasn't
surprised when Paddock entered, followed by the spare figure and
smooth keen face of Macgillivray.</p>

<p>I don't think I offered to shake hands. We were pretty good
friends, but at that moment there was no one in the world I
wanted less to see.</p>

<p>"Well, you old nuisance," I cried, "you're the second visitor
from town I've had this morning. There'll be a shortage of petrol
soon."</p>

<p>"Have you had a letter from Lord Artinswell?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I have, worse luck," I said.</p>

<p>"Then you know what I've come about. But that can keep till
after luncheon. Hurry it up, Dick, like a good fellow, for I'm as
hungry as a famished kestrel."</p>

<p>He looked rather like one, with his sharp nose and lean head.
It was impossible to be cross for long with Macgillivray, so we
went out to look for Mary. "I may as well tell you," I told him,
"that you've come on a fool's errand. I'm not going to be
jockeyed by you or anyone into making an ass of myself. Anyhow,
don't mention the thing to Mary. I don't want her to be worried
by your nonsense."</p>

<p>So at luncheon we talked about Fosse and the Cotswolds, and
about the deer-forest I had taken--Machray they called it--and
about Sir Archibald Roylance, my co-tenant, who had just had
another try at breaking his neck in a steeplechase. Macgillivray
was by way of being a great stalker and could tell me a lot about
Machray. The crab of the place was its neighbours, it seemed; for
Haripol on the south was too steep for the lessee, a middle-aged
manufacturer, to do justice to it, and the huge forest of
Glenaicill on the east was too big for any single tenant to
shoot, and the Machray end of it was nearly thirty miles by road
from the lodge. The result was, said Macgillivray, that Machray
was surrounded by unauthorised sanctuaries, which made the deer
easy to shift. He said the best time was early in the season when
the stags were on the upper ground, for it seemed that Machray
had uncommonly fine high pastures. . . . Mary was in good
spirits, for somebody had been complimentary about Peter John,
and she was satisfied for the moment that he wasn't going to be
cut off by an early consumption. She was full of housekeeping
questions about Machray, and revealed such spacious plans that
Macgillivray said that he thought he would pay us a visit, for it
looked as if he wouldn't be poisoned, as he usually was in Scotch
shooting-lodges. It was a talk I should have enjoyed if there had
not been that uneasy morning behind me and that interview I had
still to get over.</p>

<p>There was a shower after luncheon, so he and I settled
ourselves in the library. "I must leave at three-thirty," he
said, "so I have got just a little more than an hour to tell you
my business in."</p>

<p>"Is it worth while starting?" I asked. "I want to make it
quite plain that under no circumstances am I open to any offer to
take on any business of any kind. I'm having a rest and a
holiday. I stay here for the summer and then I go to
Machray."</p>

<p>"There's nothing to prevent your going to Machray in August,"
he said, opening his eyes. "The work I am going to suggest to you
must be finished long before then."</p>

<p>I suppose that surprised me, for I did not stop him as I had
meant to. I let him go on, and before I knew I found myself
getting interested. I have a boy's weakness for a yarn, and
Macgillivray knew this and played on it.</p>

<p>He began by saying very much what Dr. Greenslade had said the
night before. A large part of the world had gone mad, and that
involved the growth of inexplicable and unpredictable crime. All
the old sanctities had become weakened, and men had grown too
well accustomed to death and pain. This meant that the criminal
had far greater resources at his command, and, if he were an able
man, could mobilise a vast amount of utter recklessness and
depraved ingenuity. The moral imbecile, he said, had been more or
less a sport before the War; now he was a terribly common
product, and throve in batches and battalions. Cruel, humourless,
hard, utterly wanting in sense of proportion, but often full of a
perverted poetry and drunk with rhetoric--a hideous, untamable
breed had been engendered. You found it among the young Bolshevik
Jews, among the young gentry of the wilder Communist sects, and
very notably among the sullen murderous hobbledehoys in
Ireland.</p>

<p>"Poor devils," Macgillivray repeated. "It is for their Maker
to judge them, but we who are trying to patch up civilisation
have to see that they are cleared out of the world. Don't imagine
that they are devotees of any movement, good or bad. They are
what I have called them, moral imbeciles, who can be swept into
any movement by those who understand them. They are the neophytes
and hierophants of crime, and it is as criminals that I have to
do with them. Well, all this desperate degenerate stuff is being
used by a few clever men who are not degenerates or anything of
the sort, but only evil. There has never been such a chance for a
rogue since the world began."</p>

<p>Then he told me certain facts, which must remain unpublished,
at any rate during our life-times. The main point was that there
were sinister brains at work to organise for their own purposes
the perilous stuff lying about. All the contemporary anarchisms,
he said, were interconnected, and out of the misery of decent
folks and the agony of the wretched tools certain smug
<i>entrepreneurs</i> were profiting. He and his men, and indeed
the whole police force of civilisation--he mentioned especially
the Americans--had been on the trail of one of the worst of these
combines and by a series of fortunate chances had got their hand
on it. Now at any moment they could stretch out that hand and
gather it in.</p>

<p>But there was one difficulty. I learned from him that this
particular combine was not aware of the danger in which it stood,
but that it realised that it must stand in some danger, so it had
taken precautions. Since Christmas it had acquired hostages.</p>

<p>Here I interrupted, for I felt rather incredulous about the
whole business. "I think since the War we're all too ready to
jump at grandiose explanations of simple things. I'll want a good
deal of convincing before I believe in your international
clearing-house for crime."</p>

<p>"I guarantee the convincing," he said gravely. "You shall see
all our evidence, and, unless you have changed since I first knew
you, your conclusion won't differ from mine. But let us come to
the hostages."</p>

<p>"One I know about," I put in. "I had Mr. Julius Victor here
after breakfast."</p>

<p>Macgillivray exclaimed. "Poor soul! What did you say to
him?"</p>

<p>"Deepest sympathy, but nothing doing."</p>

<p>"And he took that answer?"</p>

<p>"I won't say he took it. But he went away. What about the
others?"</p>

<p>"There are two more. One is a young man, the heir to a
considerable estate, who was last seen by his friends in Oxford
on the 17th day of February, just before dinner. He was an
undergraduate of Christ Church, and was living out of college in
rooms in the High. He had tea at the Gridiron and went to his
rooms to dress, for he was dining that night with the Halcyon
Club. A servant passed him on the stairs of his lodgings, going
up to his bedroom. He apparently did not come down, and since
that day has not been seen. You may have heard his name--Lord
Mercot."</p>

<p>I started. I had indeed heard the name, and knew the boy a
little, having met him occasionally at our local steeplechases.
He was the grandson and heir of the old Duke of Alcester, the
most respected of the older statesmen of England.</p>

<p>"They have picked their bag carefully," I said. "What is the
third case?"</p>

<p>"The cruellest of all. You know Sir Arthur Warcliff. He is a
widower--lost his wife just before the War, and he has an only
child, a little boy about ten years old. The child--David is his
name--was the apple of his eye, and was at a preparatory school
near Rye. The father took a house in the neighbourhood to be near
him, and the boy used to be allowed to come home for luncheon
every Sunday. One Sunday he came to luncheon as usual, and
started back in the pony-trap. The boy was very keen about birds,
and used to leave the trap and walk the last half-mile by a short
cut across the marshes. Well, he left the groom at the usual
gate, and, like Miss Victor and Lord Mercot, walked into black
mystery."</p>

<p>This story really did horrify me. I remembered Sir Arthur
Warcliff--the kind, worn face of the great soldier and
administrator, and I could imagine his grief and anxiety. I knew
what I should have felt if it had been Peter John. A
much-travelled young woman and an athletic young man were
defenceful creatures compared to a poor little round-headed boy
of ten. But I still felt the whole affair too fantastic for real
tragedy.</p>

<p>"But what right have you to connect the three cases?" I asked.
"Three people disappear within a few weeks of each other in
widely separated parts of England. Miss Victor may have been
kidnapped for ransom, Lord Mercot may have lost his memory, and
David Warcliff may have been stolen by tramps. Why should they be
all part of one scheme? Why, for that matter, should any one of
them have been the work of your criminal combine? Have you any
evidence for the hostage theory?"</p>

<p>"Yes." Macgillivray took a moment or two to answer. "There is
first the general probability. If a band of rascals wanted three
hostages they could hardly find three better--the daughter of the
richest man in the world, the heir of our greatest dukedom, the
only child of a national hero. There is also direct evidence."
Again he hesitated.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say that Scotland Yard has not a single clue
to any one of these cases?"</p>

<p>"We have followed up a hundred clues, but they have all ended
in dead walls. Every detail, I assure you, has been gone through
with a fine comb. No, my dear Dick, the trouble is not that we're
specially stupid on this side, but that there is some superlative
cunning on the other. That is why I want <i>you.</i> You have a
kind of knack of stumbling on truths which no amount of ordinary
reasoning can get at. I have fifty men working day and night, and
we have mercifully kept all the cases out of the papers, so that
we are not hampered by the amateur. But so far it's a blank. Are
you going to help?"</p>

<p>"No, I'm not. But, supposing I were, I don't see that you've a
scrap of proof that the three cases are connected, or that any
one of them is due to the criminal gang that you say you've got
your hand on. You've only given me presumptions, and precious
thin at that. Where's your direct evidence?"</p>

<p>Macgillivray looked a little embarrassed. "I've started you at
the wrong end," he said. "I should have made you understand how
big and desperate the thing is that we're out against, and then
you'd have been in a more receptive mood for the rest of the
story. You know as well as I do that cold blood is not always the
most useful accompaniment in assessing evidence. I said I had
direct evidence of connection, and so I have, and the proof to my
mind is certain."</p>

<p>"Well, let's see it."</p>

<p>"It's a poem. On Wednesday of last week, two days after David
Warcliff disappeared, Mr. Julius Victor, the Duke of Alcester,
and Sir Arthur Warcliff received copies of it by the first post.
They were typed on bits of flimsy paper, the envelopes had the
addresses typed, and they had been posted in the West Central
district of London the afternoon before."</p>

<p>He handed me a copy, and this was what I read:</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Seek where under midnight's sun<br>
Laggard crops are hardly won;--<br>
Where the sower casts his seed in<br>
Furrows of the fields of Eden;--<br>
Where beside the sacred tree<br>
Spins the seer who cannot see."</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>I burst out laughing, for I could not help it--the whole thing
was too preposterous. These six lines of indifferent doggerel
seemed to me to put the coping-stone of nonsense on the business.
But I checked myself when I saw Macgillivray's face. There was a
slight flush of annoyance on his cheek, but for the rest it was
grave, composed, and in deadly earnest. Now Macgillivray was not
a fool, and I was bound to respect his beliefs. So I pulled
myself together and tried to take things seriously.</p>

<p>"That's proof that the three cases are linked together," I
said. "So much I grant you. But where's the proof that they are
the work of the great criminal combine that you say you have got
your hand on?"</p>

<p>Macgillivray rose and walked restlessly about the room. "The
evidence is mainly presumptive, but to my mind it is certain
presumption. You know as well as I do, Dick, that a case may be
final and yet very difficult to set out as a series of facts. My
view on the matter is made up of a large number of tiny
indications and cross-bearings, and I am prepared to bet that if
you put your mind honestly to the business you will take the same
view. But I'll give you this much by way of direct proof--in
hunting the big show we had several communications of the same
nature as this doggerel, and utterly unlike anything else I ever
struck in criminology. There's one of the miscreants who amuses
himself with sending useless clues to his adversaries. It shows
how secure the gang thinks itself."</p>

<p>"Well, you've got that gang anyhow. I don't quite see why the
hostages should trouble you. You'll gather them in when you
gather in the malefactors."</p>

<p>"I wonder. Remember we are dealing with moral imbeciles. When
they find themselves cornered they won't play for safety. They'll
use their hostages, and when we refuse to bargain they'll take
their last revenge on them."</p>

<p>I suppose I stared unbelievingly, for he went on: "Yes.
They'll murder them in cold blood--three innocent people--and
then swing themselves with a lighter mind. I know the type.
They've done it before." He mentioned one or two recent
instances.</p>

<p>"Good God!" I cried. "It's a horrible thought! The only thing
for you is to go canny, and not strike till you have got the
victims out of their clutches."</p>

<p>"We can't," he said solemnly. "That is precisely the tragedy
of the business. We must strike early in June. I won't trouble
you with the reasons, but believe me, they are final. There is
just a chance of a settlement in Ireland, and there are certain
events of the first importance impending in Italy and America,
and all depend upon the activities of the gang being at an end by
midsummer. Do you grasp that? By midsummer we must stretch out
our hand. By midsummer, unless they are released, the three
hostages will be doomed. It is a ghastly dilemma, but in the
public interest there is only one way out. I ought to say that
Victor and the Duke and Warcliff are aware of this fact, and
accept the situation. They are big men, and will do their duty
even if it breaks their hearts."</p>

<p>There was silence for a minute or two, for I did not know what
to say. The whole story seemed to me incredible, and yet I could
not doubt a syllable of it when I looked at Macgillivray's
earnest face. I felt the horror of the business none the less
because it seemed also partly unreal; it had the fantastic
grimness of a nightmare. But most of all I realised that I was
utterly incompetent to help, and as I understood that I could
honestly base my refusal on incapacity and not on disinclination
I began to feel more comfortable.</p>

<p>"Well," said Macgillivray, after a pause, "are you going to
help us?"</p>

<p>"There's nothing doing with that Sunday-paper anagram you
showed me. That's the sort of riddle that's not meant to be
guessed. I suppose you are going to try to work up from the
information you have about the combine towards a clue to the
hostages."</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>"Now, look here," I said; "you've got fifty of the quickest
brains in Britain working at the job. They've found out enough to
put a lasso round the enemy which you can draw tight whenever you
like. They're trained to the work and I'm not. What on earth
would be the use of an amateur like me butting in? I wouldn't be
half as good as any one of the fifty. I'm not an expert, I'm not
quick-witted, I'm a slow patient fellow, and this job, as you
admit, is one that has to be done against time. If you think it
over, you'll see that it's sheer nonsense, my dear chap."</p>

<p>"You've succeeded before with worse material."</p>

<p>"That was pure luck, and it was in the War when, as I tell
you, my mind was morbidly active. Besides, anything I did then I
did in the field, and what you want me to do now is office-work.
You know I'm no good at office-work--Blenkiron always said so,
and Bullivant never used me on it. It isn't because I don't want
to help, but because I can't."</p>

<p>"I believe you can. And the thing is so grave that I daren't
leave any chance unexplored. Won't you come?"</p>

<p>"No. Because I could do nothing."</p>

<p>"Because you haven't a mind for it."</p>

<p>"Because I haven't the right kind of mind for it."</p>

<p>He looked at his watch and got up, smiling rather
ruefully.</p>

<p>"I've had my say, and now you know what I want of you. I'm not
going to take your answer as final. Think over what I've said,
and let me hear from you within the next day or two."</p>

<p>But I had lost all my doubts, for it was very clear to me that
on every ground I was doing the right thing.</p>

<p>"Don't delude yourself with thinking that I'll change my
mind," I said, as I saw him into his car. "Honestly, old fellow,
if I could be an atom of use I'd join you, but for your own sake
you've got to count me out this time."</p>

<p>Then I went for a walk, feeling pretty cheerful. I settled the
question of the pheasants' eggs with the keeper, and went down to
the stream to see if there was any hatch of fly. It had cleared
up to a fine evening, and I thanked my stars that I was out of a
troublesome business with an easy conscience, and could enjoy my
peaceful life again. I say "with an easy conscience," for though
there were little dregs of disquiet still lurking about the
bottom of my mind, I had only to review the facts squarely to
approve my decision. I put the whole thing out of my thoughts and
came back with a fine appetite for tea.</p>

<p>There was a stranger in the drawing-room with Mary, a slim
oldish man, very straight and erect, with one of those faces on
which life has written so much that to look at them is like
reading a good book. At first I didn't recognise him when he rose
to greet me, but the smile that wrinkled the corners of his eyes
and the slow deep voice brought back the two occasions in the
past when I had run across Sir Arthur Warcliff. . . . My heart
sank as I shook hands, the more as I saw how solemn was Mary's
face. She had been hearing the story which I hoped she would
never hear.</p>

<p>I thought it best to be very frank with him. "I can guess your
errand, Sir Arthur," I said, "and I'm extremely sorry that you
should have come this long journey to no purpose." Then I told
him of the visits of Mr. Julius Victor and Macgillivray, and what
they had said, and what had been my answer. I think I made it as
clear as day that I could do nothing, and he seemed to assent.
Mary, I remember, never lifted her eyes.</p>

<p>Sir Arthur had also looked at the ground while I was speaking,
and now he turned his wise old face to me, and I saw what ravages
his new anxiety had made in it. He could not have been much over
sixty and he looked a hundred.</p>

<p>"I do not dispute your decision, Sir Richard," he said. "I
know that you would have helped me if it had been possible. But I
confess I am sorely disappointed, for you were my last hope. You
see--you see--I had nothing left in the world but Davie. If he
had died I think I could have borne it, but to know nothing about
him and to imagine terrible things is almost too much for my
fortitude."</p>

<p>I have never been through a more painful experience. To hear a
voice falter that had been used to command, to see tears in the
steadfastest eyes that ever looked on the world, made me want to
howl like a dog. I would have given a thousand pounds to be able
to bolt into the library and lock the door.</p>

<p>Mary appeared to me to be behaving very oddly. She seemed to
have the deliberate purpose of probing the wound, for she
encouraged Sir Arthur to speak of his boy. He showed us a
miniature he carried with him--an extraordinarily handsome child
with wide grey eyes and his head most nobly set upon his
shoulders. A grave little boy, with the look of utter trust which
belongs to children who have never in their lives been unfairly
treated. Mary said something about the gentleness of the
face.</p>

<p>"Yes, Davie was very gentle," his father said. "I think he was
the gentlest thing I have ever known. That little boy was the
very flower of courtesy. But he was curiously stoical, too. When
he was distressed, he only shut his lips tight, and never cried.
I used often to feel rebuked by him."</p>

<p>And then he told us about Davie's performances at school,
where he was not distinguished, except as showing a certain
talent for cricket. "I am very much afraid of precocity," Sir
Arthur said with the ghost of a smile. "But he was always
educating himself in the right way, learning to observe and
think." It seemed that the boy was a desperately keen naturalist
and would be out at all hours watching wild things. He was a
great fisherman, too, and had killed a lot of trout with the fly
on hill burns in Galloway. And as the father spoke I suddenly
began to realise the little chap, and to think that he was just
the kind of boy I wanted Peter John to be. I liked the stories of
his love of nature and trout streams. It came on me like a
thunderclap that if I were in his father's place I should
certainly go mad, and I was amazed at the old man's courage.</p>

<p>"I think he had a kind of genius for animals," Sir Arthur
said. "He knew the habits of birds by instinct, and used to talk
of them as other people talk of their friends. He and I were
great cronies, and he would tell me long stories in his little
quiet voice of birds and beasts he had seen on his walks. He had
odd names for them too. . . ."</p>

<p>The thing was almost too pitiful to endure. I felt as if I had
known the child all my life. I could see him playing, I could
hear his voice, and as for Mary she was unashamedly weeping.</p>

<p>Sir Arthur's eyes were dry now, and there was no catch in his
voice as he spoke. But suddenly a sharper flash of realisation
came on him and his words became a strained cry: "Where is he
now? What are they doing to him? Oh, God! My beloved little
man--my gentle little Davie!"</p>

<p>That fairly finished me. Mary's arm was round the old man's
neck, and I saw that he was trying to pull himself together, but
I didn't see anything clearly. I only know that I was marching
about the room, scarcely noticing that our guest was leaving. I
remember shaking hands with him, and hearing him say that it had
done him good to talk to us. It was Mary who escorted him to the
car, and when she returned it was to find me blaspheming like a
Turk at the window. I had flung the thing open, for I felt
suffocated, though the evening was cool. The mixture of anger and
disgust and pity in my heart nearly choked me.</p>

<p>"Why the devil can't I be left alone?" I cried. "I don't ask
for much--only a little peace. Why in Heaven's name should I be
dragged into other people's business? Why on earth--"</p>

<p>Mary was standing at my elbow, her face rather white and
tear-stained.</p>

<p>"Of course you are going to help," she said.</p>

<p>Her words made clear to me the decision which I must have
taken a quarter of an hour before, and all the passion went out
of me like wind out of a pricked bladder.</p>

<p>"Of course," I answered. "By the way, I had better telegraph
to Macgillivray. And Warcliff too. What's his address?"</p>

<p>"You needn't bother about Sir Arthur," said Mary. "Before you
came in--when he told me the story--I said he could count on you.
Oh, Dick, think if it had been Peter John!"</p>

<h1><a name="c03">CHAPTER III</a></h1>

<h1>RESEARCHES IN THE SUBCONSCIOUS</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>I went to bed in the perfect certainty that I wouldn't sleep.
That happened to me about once a year, when my mind was excited
or angry, and I knew no way of dodging it. There was a fine moon,
and the windows were sheets of opal cut by the dark jade limbs of
trees; light winds were stirring the creepers; owls hooted like
sentries exchanging passwords, and sometimes a rook would talk in
its dreams; the little odd squeaks and rumbles of wild life came
faintly from the woods; while I lay staring at the ceiling with
my thoughts running round about in a futile circus. Mary's even
breathing tantalised me, for I never knew anyone with her perfect
gift for slumber. I used to say that if her pedigree could be
properly traced it would be found that she descended direct from
one of the Seven Sleepers of Ephesus who married one of the
Foolish Virgins.</p>

<p>What kept me wakeful was principally the thought of that poor
little boy, David Warcliff. I was sorry for Miss Victor and Lord
Mercot, and desperately sorry for the parents of all three, but
what I could not stand was the notion of the innocent little
chap, who loved birds and fishing and the open air, hidden away
in some stuffy den by the worst kind of blackguards. The thing
preyed on me till I got to think it had happened to us and that
Peter John was missing. I rose and prowled about the windows,
looking out at the quiet night, and wondering how the same world
could contain so much trouble and so much peace.</p>

<p>I laved my face with cold water and lay down again. It was no
good letting my thoughts race, so I tried to fix them on one
point in the hope that I would get drowsy. I endeavoured to
recapitulate the evidence which Macgillivray had recited, but
only made foolishness of it, for I simply could not concentrate.
I saw always the face of a small boy, who bit his lips to keep
himself from tears, and another perfectly hideous face that kept
turning into one of the lead figures in the rose garden. A
ridiculous rhyme too ran in my head--something thing about the
"midnight sun" and the "fields of Eden." By and by I got it
straightened out into the anagram business Macgillivray had
mentioned. I have a fly-paper memory for verse when there is no
reason why I should remember it, and I found I could repeat the
six lines of the doggerel.</p>

<p>After that I found the lines mixing themselves up, and
suggesting all kinds of odd pictures to my brain. I took to
paraphrasing them--"Under the midnight sun, where harvests are
poor"--that was Scandinavia anyhow, or maybe Iceland or Greenland
or Labrador. Who on earth was the sower who sowed in the fields
of Eden? Adam, perhaps, or Abel, who was the first farmer? Or an
angel in heaven? More like an angel, I thought, for the line
sounded like a hymn. Anyhow it was infernal nonsense.</p>

<p>The last two lines took to escaping me, and that made me force
my mind out of the irritable confusion in which it was bogged.
Ah! I had them again:</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Where beside the sacred tree<br>
Spins the seer who cannot see."</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>The sacred tree was probably Yggdrasil and the spinner one of
the Norns. I had once taken an interest in Norse mythology, but I
couldn't remember whether one of the Norns was blind. A blind
woman spinning. Now where had I heard something like that? Heard
it quite recently, too?</p>

<p>The discomfort of wakefulness is that you are not fully awake.
But now I was suddenly in full possession of my senses, and
worrying at that balderdash like a dog at a bone. I had been
quite convinced that there was a clue in it, but that it would be
impossible to hit on the clue. But now I had a ray of hope, for I
seemed to feel a very faint and vague flavour of
reminiscence.</p>

<p>Scandinavian harvests, the fields of Eden, the blind
spinner--oh, it was maddening, for every time I repeated them the
sense of having recently met with something similar grew
stronger. The North--Norway--surely I had it there! Norway--what
was there about Norway?--Salmon, elk, reindeer, midnight sun,
<i>saeters</i>--the last cried out to me. And the blind old woman
that spun!</p>

<p>I had it. These were two of the three facts which Dr.
Greenslade had suggested the night before as a foundation for his
imaginary "shocker." What was the third? A curiosity shop in
North London kept by a Jew with a dyed beard. That had no obvious
connection with a sower in the fields of Eden. But at any rate he
had got two of them identical with the doggerel. . . . It was a
clue. It must be a clue. Greenslade had somewhere and somehow
heard the jingle or the substance of it, and it had sunk into the
subconscious memory he had spoken of, without his being aware of
it. Well, I had got to dig it out. If I could discover where and
how he had heard the thing, I had struck a trail.</p>

<p>When I had reached this conclusion, I felt curiously easier in
my mind, and almost at once fell asleep. I awoke to a gorgeous
spring morning, and ran down to the lake for my bath. I felt that
I wanted all the freshening and screwing up I could get, and when
I dressed after an icy plunge I was ready for all comers.</p>

<p>Mary was down in time for breakfast, and busy with her
letters. She spoke little, and seemed to be waiting for me to
begin; but I didn't want to raise the matter which was uppermost
in our minds till I saw my way clearer, so I said I was going to
take two days to think things over. It was Wednesday, so I wired
to Macgillivray to expect me in London on Friday morning, and I
scribbled a line to Mr. Julius Victor. By half-past nine I was on
the road making for Greenslade's lodgings.</p>

<p>I caught him in the act of starting on his rounds, and made
him sit down and listen to me. I had to give him the gist of
Macgillivray's story, with extracts from those of Victor and Sir
Arthur. Before I was half-way through he had flung off his
overcoat, and before I had finished he had lit a pipe, which was
a breach of his ritual not to smoke before the evening. When I
stopped he had that wildish look in his light eyes which you see
in a cairn terrier's when he is digging out a badger.</p>

<p>"You've taken on this job?" he asked brusquely.</p>

<p>I nodded.</p>

<p>"Well, I shouldn't have had much respect for you if you had
refused. How can I help? Count on me, if I'm any use. Good God! I
never heard a more damnable story."</p>

<p>"Have you got hold of the rhyme?" I repeated it, and he said
it after me.</p>

<p>"Now, you remember the talk we had after dinner the night
before last. You showed me how a 'shocker' was written, and you
took at random three facts as the foundation. They were, you
remember, a blind old woman spinning in the Western Highlands, a
<i>saeter</i> in Norway, and a curiosity shop in North London,
kept by a Jew with a dyed beard. Well, two of your facts are in
that six-line jingle I have quoted to you."</p>

<p>"That is an odd coincidence. But is it anything more?"</p>

<p>"I believe that it is. I don't hold with coincidences. There's
generally some explanations which we're not clever enough to get
at. Your inventions were so odd that I can't think they were mere
inventions. You must have heard them somehow and somewhere. You
know what you said about your subconscious memory. They're
somewhere in it, and, if you can remember just how they got
there, you'll give me the clue I want. That six-line rhyme was
sent in by people who were so confident that they didn't mind
giving their enemies a clue--only it was a clue which they knew
could never be discovered. Macgillivray and his fellows can make
nothing of it--never will. But if I can start from the other end
I'll get in on their rear. Do you see what I mean? I'm going to
make you somehow or other dig it out."</p>

<p>He shook his head. "It can't be done, Dick. Admitting your
premise--that I heard the nonsense and didn't invent it--the
subconscious can't be handled like a business proposition. I
remember unconsciously and I can't recall consciously. . . . But
I don't admit your premise. I think the whole thing is common
coincidence."</p>

<p>"I don't," I said stubbornly, "and even if I did I'm bound to
assume the contrary, for it's the only card I possess. You've got
to sit down, old chap, and do your damnedest to remember. You've
been in every kind of odd show, and my belief is that you
<i>heard</i> that nonsense. Dig it out of your memory and we've a
chance to win. Otherwise, I see nothing but tragedy."</p>

<p>He got up and put on his overcoat. "I've got a long round of
visits which will take me all day. Of course I'll try, but I warn
you that I haven't the ghost of a hope. These things don't come
by care and searching. I'd better sleep at the Manor to-night.
How long can you give me?"</p>

<p>"Two days--I go up to town on Friday morning. Yes, you must
take up your quarters with us. Mary insists on it."</p>

<p>There was a crying of young lambs from the meadow, and through
the open window came the sound of the farm-carts jolting from the
stackyard into the lane. Greenslade screwed up his face and
laughed.</p>

<p>"A nasty breach in your country peace, Dick. You know I'm with
you if there's any trouble going. Let's get the thing clear, for
there's a lot of researching ahead of me. My three were an old
blind woman spinning in the Western Highlands--Western Highlands,
was it?--a <i>saeter</i> barn, and a Jew curiosity shop. The
other three were a blind spinner under a sacred tree, a
<i>saeter</i> of sorts, and a sower in the fields of Eden--Lord,
such rot! Two pairs seem to coincide, the other pair looks
hopeless. Well, here goes for fortune! I'm going to break my rule
and take my pipe with me, for this business demands tobacco."</p>

<p>I spent a busy day writing letters and making arrangements
about the Manor, for it looked as if I might be little at home
for the next month. Oddly enough, I felt no restlessness or any
particular anxiety. That would come later; for the moment I
seemed to be waiting on Providence in the person of Tom
Greenslade. I was trusting my instinct which told me that in
those random words of his there was more than coincidence, and
that with luck I might get from them a line on our problem.</p>

<p>Greenslade turned up about seven in the evening, rather glum
and preoccupied. At dinner he ate nothing, and when we sat
afterwards in the library he seemed to be chiefly interested in
reading the advertisements in <i>The Times.</i> When I asked
"What luck?" he turned on me a disconsolate face.</p>

<p>"It is the most futile job I ever took on," he groaned. "So
far it's an absolute blank, and anyhow I've been taking the wrong
line. I've been trying to <i>think</i> myself into recollection,
and, as I said, this thing comes not by searching, nor yet by
prayer and fasting. It occurred to me that I might get at
something by following up the differences between the three
pairs. It's a familiar method in inductive logic, for differences
are often more suggestive than resemblances. So I worried away at
the 'sacred tree' as contrasted with the 'Western Highlands' and
the 'fields of Eden' as set against the curiosity shop. No
earthly good. I gave myself a headache and I dare say I've
poisoned half my patients. It's no use, Dick, but I'll peg away
for the rest of the prescribed two days. I'm letting my mind lie
fallow now and trusting to inspiration. I've got two faint
glimmerings of notions. First, I don't believe I said 'Western
Highlands.'"</p>

<p>"I'm positive those were your words. What did you say,
then?"</p>

<p>"Hanged if I know, but I'm pretty certain it wasn't that. I
can't explain properly, but you get an atmosphere about certain
things in your mind and that phrase somehow jars with the
atmosphere. Different key. Wrong tone. Second, I've got a hazy
intuition that the thing, if it is really in my memory, is
somehow mixed up with a hymn tune. I don't know what tune, and
the whole impression is as vague as smoke, but I tell it you for
what it is worth. If I could get the right tune, I might remember
something."</p>

<p>"You've stopped thinking?"</p>

<p>"Utterly. I'm an Aeolian harp to be played on by any wandering
wind. You see, if I did hear these three things there is no
conscious rational clue to it. They were never part of my
workaday mind. The only chance is that some material phenomenon
may come along and link itself with them and so rebuild the scene
where I heard them. A scent would be best, but a tune might do.
Our one hope--and it's about as strong as a single thread of
gossamer on the grass--is that that tune may drift into my head.
You see the point, Dick? Thought won't do, for the problem
doesn't concern the mind, but some tiny physical sensation of
nose, ear, or eye might press the button. Now, it may be
hallucination, but I've a feeling that the three facts I thought
I invented were in some infinitely recondite way connected with a
hymn tune."</p>

<p>He went to bed early, while I sat up till nearly midnight
writing letters. As I went upstairs, I had a strong sense of
futility and discouragement. It seemed the merest trifling to be
groping among these spectral unrealities, while tragedy, as big
and indisputable as a mountain, was overhanging us. I had to
remind myself how often the trivial was the vital before I got
rid of the prick in my conscience. I was tired and sleepy, and as
I forced myself to think of the immediate problem, the six lines
of the jingle were all blurred. While I undressed I tried to
repeat them, but could not get the fourth to scan. It came out as
"fields of Erin," and after that "the green fields of Erin." Then
it became "the green fields of Eden."</p>

<p>I found myself humming a tune.</p>

<p>It was an old hymn which the Salvation Army used to play in
the Cape Town streets when I was a schoolboy. I hadn't heard it
or thought of it for thirty years. But I remembered the tune very
clearly, a pretty, catchy thing like an early Victorian
drawing-room ballad, and I remembered the words of the
chorus--</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>"On the other side of Jordan<br>
In the green fields of Eden,<br>
Where the Tree of Life is blooming,<br>
There is rest for you."</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>I marched off to Greenslade's room and found him lying wide
awake staring at the ceiling, with the lamp by his bedside lit. I
must have broken in on some train of thought, for he looked at me
crossly.</p>

<p>"I've got your tune," I said, and I whistled it, and then
quoted what words I remembered.</p>

<p>"Tune be blowed," he said. "I never heard it before." But he
hummed it after me, and made me repeat the words several
times.</p>

<p>"No good, I'm afraid. It doesn't seem to hank on to anything.
Lord, this is a fool's game. I'm off to sleep."</p>

<p>But three minutes later came a knock at my dressing-room door,
and Greenslade entered. I saw by his eyes that he was
excited.</p>

<p>"It's the tune all right. I can't explain why, but those three
blessed facts of mine fit into it like prawns in an aspic. I'm
feeling my way towards the light now. I thought I'd just tell
you, for you may sleep better for hearing it."</p>

<p>I slept like a log, and went down to breakfast feeling more
cheerful than I had felt for several days. But the doctor seemed
to have had a poor night. His eyes looked gummy and heavy, and he
had ruffled his hair out of all hope of order. I knew that trick
of his; when his hair began to stick up at the back he was out of
sorts either in mind or body. I noticed that he had got himself
up in knickerbockers and thick shoes.</p>

<p>After breakfast he showed no inclination to smoke. "I feel as
if I were going to be beaten on the post," he groaned. "I'm a
complete convert to your view, Dick. I <i>heard</i> my three
facts and didn't invent them. What's more, my three are
definitely linked with the three in those miscreants' doggerel.
That tune proves it, for it talks about the 'fields of Eden' and
yet is identified in my memory with my three which didn't mention
Eden. That's a tremendous point and proves we're on the right
road. But I'm hanged if I can get a step farther. Wherever I
heard the facts I heard the tune, but I'm no nearer finding out
that place. I've got one bearing, and I need a second to give me
the point of intersection I want, and how the deuce I'm to get it
I don't know."</p>

<p>Greenslade was now keener even than I was on the chase, and
indeed his lean anxious face was uncommonly like an old hound's.
I asked him what he was going to do.</p>

<p>"At ten o'clock precisely I start on a walk--right round the
head of the Windrush and home by the Forest. It's going to be a
thirty-mile stride at a steady four and a half miles an hour,
which, with half an hour for lunch, will get me back here before
six. I'm going to drug my body and mind into apathy by hard
exercise. Then I shall have a hot bath and a good dinner, and
after that, when I'm properly fallow, I may get the revelation.
The mistake I made yesterday was in trying to <i>think."</i></p>

<p>It was a gleamy blustering March morning, the very weather for
a walk, and I would have liked to accompany him. As it was I
watched his long legs striding up the field we call Big Pasture,
and then gave up the day to the job of putting Loch Leven fry
into one of the ponds--a task so supremely muddy and wet that I
had very little leisure to think of other things. In the
afternoon I rode over to the market-town to see my builder, and
got back only just before dinner to learn that Greenslade had
returned. He was now wallowing in a hot bath, according to his
programme.</p>

<p>At dinner he seemed to be in better spirits. The wind had
heightened his colour, and given him a ferocious appetite, and
the 1906 Clicquot, which I regard as the proper drink after a
hard day, gave him the stimulus he needed. He talked as he had
talked three nights ago, before this business got us in its
clutches. Mary disappeared after dinner, and we sat ourselves in
big chairs before the library fire, like two drowsy men who have
had a busy day in the open air. I thought I had better say
nothing till he chose to speak.</p>

<p>He was silent for a long time, and then he laughed not very
mirthfully.</p>

<p>"I'm as far off it as ever. All day I've been letting my mind
wander and measuring off miles with my two legs like a pair of
compasses. But nothing has come to me. No word yet of that
confounded cross-bearing I need. I might have heard that tune in
any one of a thousand parts of the globe. You see, my rackety
life is a disadvantage--I've had too many different sorts of
experience. If I'd been a curate all my days in one village it
would have been easier."</p>

<p>I waited, and he went on, speaking not to me but to the fire:
"I've got an impression so strong that it amounts to certainty
that I never heard the words 'Western Highlands.' It was
something like it, but not that."</p>

<p>"Western Islands," I suggested.</p>

<p>"What could they be?"</p>

<p>"I think I've heard the phrase used about the islands off the
west coast of Ireland. Does that help you?"</p>

<p>He shook his head. "No good. I've never been in Ireland."</p>

<p>After that he was silent again, staring at the fire, while I
smoked opposite him, feeling pretty blank and dispirited. I
realised that I had banked more than I knew on this line of
inquiry which seemed to be coming to nothing. . . .</p>

<p>Then suddenly there happened one of those trivial things which
look like accidents but I believe are part of the reasoned
government of the universe.</p>

<p>I leaned forward to knock out the ashes of my pipe against the
stone edge of the hearth. I hammered harder than I intended, and
the pipe, which was an old one, broke off at the bowl. I
exclaimed irritably, for I hate to lose an old pipe, and then
pulled up sharp at the sight of Greenslade.</p>

<p>He was staring open-mouthed at the fragments in my hand, and
his eyes were those of a man whose thoughts are far away. He held
up one hand, while I froze into silence. Then the tension
relaxed, and he dropped back into his chair with a sigh.</p>

<p>"The cross-bearing!" he said. "I've got it. . . . Medina."</p>

<p>Then he laughed at my puzzled face.</p>

<p>"I'm not mad, Dick. I once talked to a man, and as we talked
he broke the bowl of his pipe as you have just done. He was the
man who hummed the hymn tune, and though I haven't the remotest
recollection of what he said, I am as certain as that I am alive
that he gave me the three facts which sunk into the abyss of my
subconscious memory. Wait a minute. Yes. I see it as plain as I
see you. He broke his pipe just as you have done, and some time
or other he hummed that tune."</p>

<p>"Who was he?" I asked, but Greenslade disregarded the
question. He was telling his story in his own way, with his eyes
still abstracted as if he were looking down a long corridor of
memory.</p>

<p>"I was staying at the Bull at Hanham--shooting wild-fowl on
the sea marshes. I had the place to myself, for it wasn't weather
for a country pub, but late one night a car broke down outside,
and the owner and his chauffeur had to put up at the Bull. Oddly
enough I knew the man. He had been at one of the big shoots at
Rousham Thorpe and was on his way back to London. We had a lot to
say to each other and sat up into the small hours. We talked
about sport, and the upper glens of the Yarkand river, where I
first met him. I remember quite a lot of our talk, but not the
three facts or the tune, which made no appeal to my conscious
memory. Only of course they must have been there."</p>

<p>"When did this happen?"</p>

<p>"Early last December, the time we had the black frost. You
remember, Dick, how I took a week's holiday and went down to
Norfolk after duck."</p>

<p>"You haven't told me the man's name."</p>

<p>"I have. Medina."</p>

<p>"Who on earth is Medina?"</p>

<p>"Oh Lord! Dick. You're overdoing the rustic. You've heard of
Dominick Medina."</p>

<p>I had, of course, when he mentioned the Christian name. You
couldn't open a paper without seeing something about Dominick
Medina, but whether he was a poet or a politician or an
actor-manager I hadn't troubled to inquire. There was a pile of
picture-papers on a side-table, and I fetched them and began to
turn them over. Very soon I found what I wanted. It was a
photograph of a group at a country-house party for some
steeplechase, the usual "reading-from-left-to-right" business,
and there between a Duchess and a foreign Princess was Mr.
Dominick Medina. The poverty of the photograph could not conceal
the extraordinary good looks of the man. He had the kind of head
I fancy Byron had, and I seemed to discern, too, a fine, clean,
athletic figure.</p>

<p>"If you had happened to look at that rag you might have
short-circuited your inquiry."</p>

<p>He shook his head. "No. It doesn't happen that way. I had to
get your broken pipe and the tune or I would have been
stuck."</p>

<p>"Then I suppose I have to get in touch with this chap and find
where he picked up the three facts and the tune. But how if he
turns out to be like you, another babbler from the
subconscious?"</p>

<p>"That is the risk you run, of course. He may be able to help
you, or more likely he may prove only another dead wall."</p>

<p>I felt suddenly an acute sense of the difficulty of the job I
had taken on, and something very near hopelessness.</p>

<p>"Tell me about this Medina. Is he a decent fellow?"</p>

<p>"I suppose so. Yes, I should think so. But he moves in higher
circles than I'm accustomed to, so I can't judge. But I'll tell
you what he is beyond doubt--he's rather a great man. Hang it,
Dick, you must have heard of him. He's one of the finest shots
living, and he's done some tall things in the exploration way,
and he was the devil of a fellow as a partisan leader in South
Russia. Also--though it may not interest you--he's an uncommon
fine poet."</p>

<p>"I suppose he's some sort of a Dago."</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it. Old Spanish family settled here for three
centuries. One of them rode with Rupert. Hold on! I rather
believe I've heard that his people live in Ireland, or did live,
till life there became impossible."</p>

<p>"What age?"</p>

<p>"Youngish. Not more than thirty-five. Oh, and the handsomest
thing in mankind since the Greeks."</p>

<p>"I'm not a flapper," I said impatiently. "Good looks in a man
are no sort of recommendation to me. I shall probably take a
dislike to his face."</p>

<p>"You won't. From what I know of him and you you'll fall under
his charm at first sight. I never heard of a man that didn't. He
has a curious musical voice and eyes that warm you--glow like
sunlight. Not that I know him well, but I own I found him
extraordinarily attractive. And you see from the papers what the
world thinks of him."</p>

<p>"All the same I'm not much nearer my goal. I've got to find
out where he heard those three blessed facts and that idiotic
tune. He'll probably send me to blazes, and, even if he's civil,
he'll very likely be helpless."</p>

<p>"Your chance is that he's a really clever man, not an old
blunderer like me. You'll get the help of a first-class mind, and
that means a lot. Shall I write you a line of introduction?"</p>

<p>He sat down at my desk and wrote. "I'm saying nothing about
your errand--simply that I'd like you to know each other--common
interest in sport and travel--that sort of thing. You're going to
be in London, so I had better give your address as your
club."</p>

<p>Next morning Greenslade went back to his duties and I caught
the early train to town. I was not very happy about Mr. Dominick
Medina, for I didn't seem able to get hold of him. <i>Who's
Who</i> only gave his age, his residence--Hill Street, his club,
and the fact that he was M.P. for a South London division. Mary
had never met him, for he had appeared in London after she had
stopped going about, but she remembered that her Wymondham aunts
raved about him, and she had read somewhere an article on his
poetry. As I sat in the express, I tried to reconstruct what kind
of fellow he must be--a mixture of Byron and Sir Richard Burton
and the young political highbrow. The picture wouldn't compose,
for I saw only a figure like a waxwork, with a cooing voice and a
shop-walker's suavity. Also his name kept confusing me, for I
mixed him up with an old ruffian of a Portugee I once knew at
Beira.</p>

<p>I was walking down St. James's Street on my way to Whitehall,
pretty much occupied with my own thoughts, when I was brought up
by a hand placed flat on my chest, and lo! and behold! it was
Sandy Arbuthnot.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h1><a name="c04">CHAPTER IV</a></h1>

<h1>I MAKE THE ACQUAINTANCE OF A POPULAR MAN</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>You may imagine how glad I was to see old Sandy again, for I
had not set eyes on him since 1916. He had been an Intelligence
Officer with Maude, and then something at Simla, and after the
War had had an administrative job in Mesopotamia, or, as they
call it nowadays, Iraq. He had written to me from all kinds of
queer places, but he never appeared to be coming home, and, what
with my marriage and my settling in the country, we seemed to be
fixed in ruts that were not likely to intersect. I had seen his
elder brother's death in the papers, so he was now Master of
Clanroyden and heir to the family estates, but I didn't imagine
that that would make a Scotch laird of him. I never saw a fellow
less changed by five years of toil and travel. He was desperately
slight and tanned--he had always been that, but the contours of
his face were still soft like a girl's, and his brown eyes were
merry as ever.</p>

<p>We stood and stared at each other.</p>

<p>"Dick, old man," he cried, "I'm home for good. Yes--honour
bright. For months and months, if not years and years. I've got
so much to say to you I don't know where to begin. But I can't
wait now. I'm off to Scotland to see my father. He's my chief
concern now, for he's getting very frail. But I'll be back in
three days. Let's dine together on Tuesday."</p>

<p>We were standing at the door of a club--his and mine--and a
porter was stowing his baggage into a taxi. Before I could
properly realise that it was Sandy, he was waving his hand from
the taxi window and disappearing up the street.</p>

<p>The sight of him cheered me immensely and I went on along Pall
Mall in a good temper. To have Sandy back in England and at call
made me feel somehow more substantial, like a commander who knows
his reserves are near. When I entered Macgillivray's room I was
smiling, and the sight of me woke an answering smile on his
anxious face. "Good man!" he said. "You look like business.
You're to put yourself at my disposal while I give you your
bearings."</p>

<p>He got out his papers and expounded the whole affair. It was a
very queer story, yet the more I looked into it the thinner my
scepticism grew. I am not going to write it all down, for it is
not yet time; it would give away certain methods which have not
yet exhausted their usefulness; but before I had gone very far, I
took off my hat to these same methods, for they showed amazing
patience and ingenuity. It was an odd set of links that made up
the chain. There was an importer of Barcelona nuts with a modest
office near Tower Hill. There was a copper company, purporting to
operate in Spain, whose shares were not quoted on the Stock
Exchange, but which had a fine office in London Wall, where you
could get the best luncheon in the City. There was a respectable
accountant in Glasgow, and a French count, who was also some kind
of Highland laird and a great supporter of the White Rose League.
There was a country gentleman living in Shropshire, who had
bought his place after the War and was a keen rider to hounds and
a very popular figure in the county. There was a little office
not far from Fleet Street, which professed to be the English
agency of an American religious magazine; and there was a certain
publicist, who was always appealing in the newspapers for help
for the distressed populations of Central Europe. I remembered
his appeals well, for I had myself twice sent him small
subscriptions. The way Macgillivray had worked out the connection
between these gentry filled me with awe.</p>

<p>Then he showed me specimens of their work. It was sheer
unmitigated crime, a sort of selling a bear on a huge scale in a
sinking world. The aim of the gang was money, and already they
had made scandalous profits. Partly their business was mere
conscienceless profiteering well inside the bounds of the law,
such as gambling in falling exchanges and using every kind of
brazen and subtle trick to make their gamble a certainty. Partly
it was common fraud of the largest size. But there were darker
sides--murder when the victim ran athwart their schemes, strikes
engineered when a wrecked industry somewhere or other in the
world showed symptoms of reviving, shoddy little outbursts in
shoddy little countries which increased the tangle. These fellows
were wreckers on the grand scale, merchants of pessimism, giving
society another kick downhill whenever it had a chance of finding
its balance, and then pocketing their profits.</p>

<p>Their motive, as I have said, was gain but that was not the
motive of the people they worked through. Their cleverness lay in
the fact that they used the fanatics, the moral imbeciles as
Macgillivray called them, whose key was a wild hatred of
something or other, or a reasoned belief in anarchy. Behind the
smug exploiters lay the whole dreary wastes of half-baked
craziness. Macgillivray gave me examples of how they used these
tools, the fellows who had no thought of profit, and were ready
to sacrifice everything, including their lives, for a mad ideal.
It was a masterpiece of cold-blooded, devilish ingenuity.
Hideous, and yet comic too; for the spectacle of these feverish
cranks toiling to create a new heaven and a new earth and
thinking themselves the leaders of mankind, when they were
dancing like puppets at the will of a few scoundrels engaged in
the most ancient of pursuits, was an irony to make the gods
laugh.</p>

<p>I asked who was their leader.</p>

<p>Macgillivray said he wasn't certain. No one of the gang seemed
to have more authority than the others, and their activities were
beautifully specialised. But he agreed that there was probably
one master mind, and said grimly that he would know more about
that when they were rounded up. "The dock will settle that
question."</p>

<p>"How much do they suspect?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Not much. A little, or they would not have taken hostages.
But not much, for we have been very careful to make no sign.
Only, since we became cognisant of the affair, we have managed
very quietly to put a spoke in the wheels of some of their worst
enterprises, though I am positive they have no suspicion of it.
Also we have put the brake on their propaganda side. They are
masters of propaganda, you know. Dick, have you ever considered
what a diabolical weapon that can be--using all the channels of
modern publicity to poison and warp men's minds? It is the most
dangerous thing on earth. You can use it cleanly--as I think on
the whole we did in the War--but you can also use it to establish
the most damnable lies. Happily in the long run it defeats
itself, but only after it has sown the world with mischief. Look
at the Irish! They are the cleverest propagandists extant, and
managed to persuade most people that they were a brave, generous,
humorous, talented, warm-hearted race, cruelly yoked to a dull
mercantile England, when God knows they were exactly the
opposite."</p>

<p>Macgillivray, I may remark, is an Ulsterman, and has his
prejudices.</p>

<p>"About the gang--I suppose they're all pretty respectable to
outward view?"</p>

<p>"Highly respectable," he said. "I met one of them at dinner
the other night at ----'s"--he mentioned the name of a member of
the Government. "Before Christmas I was at a cover shoot in
Suffolk, and one of the worst had the stand next me--an
uncommonly agreeable fellow."</p>

<p>Then we sat down to business. Macgillivray's idea was that I
should study the details of the thing and then get alongside some
of the people. He thought I might begin with the Shropshire
squire. He fancied that I might stumble on something which would
give me a line on the hostages, for he stuck to his absurd notion
that I had a special <i>flair</i> which the amateur sometimes
possessed and the professional lacked. I agreed that that was the
best plan, and arranged to spend Sunday in his room going over
the secret <i>dossiers.</i> I was beginning to get keen about the
thing, for Macgillivray had a knack of making whatever he handled
as interesting as a game.</p>

<p>I had meant to tell him about my experiments with Greenslade;
but after what he had shown me I felt that that story was
absurdly thin and unpromising. But as I was leaving, I asked him
casually if he knew Mr. Dominick Medina.</p>

<p>He smiled. "Why do you ask? He's scarcely your line of
country."</p>

<p>"I don't know. I've heard a lot about him and I thought I
would rather like to meet him."</p>

<p>"I barely know him, but I must confess that the few times I've
met him I was enormously attracted. He's the handsomest being
alive."</p>

<p>"So I'm told, and it's the only thing that puts me off."</p>

<p>"It wouldn't if you saw him. He's not in the least the
ordinary matin&eacute;e idol. He is the only fellow I ever heard
of who was adored by women and also liked by men. He's a
first-class sportsman and said to be the best shot in England
after His Majesty. He's a coming man in politics, too, and a most
finished speaker. I once heard him, and, though I take very
little stock in oratory, he almost had me on my feet. He has
knocked a bit about the world, and he is also a very pretty poet,
though that wouldn't interest you."</p>

<p>"I don't know why you say that," I protested. "I'm getting
rather good at poetry."</p>

<p>"Oh, I know. Scott and Macaulay and Tennyson. But that is not
Medina's line. He is a deity of <i>les jeunes</i> and a hardy
innovator. Jolly good, too. The man's a fine classical
scholar."</p>

<p>"Well, I hope to meet him soon, and I'll let you know my
impression."</p>

<p>I had posted my letter to Medina, enclosing Greenslade's
introduction, on my way from the station, and next morning I
found a very civil reply from him at my club. Greenslade had
talked of our common interest in big-game shooting, and he
professed to know all about me, and to be anxious to make my
acquaintance. He was out of town unfortunately for the week-end,
he said, but he suggested that I should lunch with him on the
Monday. He named a club, a small, select, old-fashioned one of
which most of the members were hunting squires.</p>

<p>I looked forward to meeting him with a quite inexplicable
interest and on Sunday, when I was worrying through papers in
Macgillivray's room, I had him at the back of my mind. I had made
a picture of something between a Ouida guardsman and the Apollo
Belvedere and rigged it out in the smartest clothes. But when I
gave my name to the porter at the club door, and a young man who
was warming his hands at the hall fire came forward to meet me, I
had to wipe that picture clean off my mind.</p>

<p>He was about my own height, just under six feet, and at first
sight rather slightly built, but a hefty enough fellow to eyes
which knew where to look for the points of a man's strength.
Still he appeared slim, and therefore young, and you could see
from the way he stood and walked that he was as light on his feet
as a rope-dancer. There is a horrible word in the newspapers,
"well-groomed," applied to men by lady journalists, which always
makes me think of a glossy horse on which a stable-boy has been
busy with the brush and currycomb. I had thought of him as
"well-groomed," but there was nothing glossy about his
appearance. He wore a rather old well-cut brown tweed suit, with
a soft shirt and collar, and a russet tie that matched his
complexion. His get-up was exactly that of a country squire who
has come up to town for a day at Tattersalls'.</p>

<p>I find it difficult to describe my first impression of his
face, for my memory is all overlaid with other impressions
acquired when I looked at it in very different circumstances. But
my chief feeling, I remember, was that it was singularly
pleasant. It was very English, and yet not quite English; the
colouring was a little warmer than sun or weather would give, and
there was a kind of silken graciousness about it not commonly
found in our countrymen. It was beautifully cut, every feature
regular, and yet there was a touch of ruggedness that saved it
from conventionality. I was puzzled about this, till I saw that
it came from two things, the hair and the eyes. The hair was a
dark brown, brushed in a wave above the forehead, so that the
face with its strong fine chin made an almost perfect square. But
the eyes were the thing. They were of a startling blue, not the
pale blue which is common enough and belongs to our Norse
ancestry, but a deep dark blue, like the colour of a sapphire.
Indeed if you think of a sapphire with the brilliance of a
diamond, you get a pretty fair notion of those eyes. They would
have made a plain-headed woman lovely, and in a man's face, which
had not a touch of the feminine, they were startling.
Startling--I stick to that word--but also entrancing.</p>

<p>He greeted me as if he had been living for this hour, and also
with a touch of the deference due to a stranger.</p>

<p>"This is delightful, Sir Richard. It was very good of you to
come. We've got a table to ourselves by the fire. I hope you're
hungry. I've had a devilish cold journey this morning and I want
my luncheon."</p>

<p>I was hungry enough and I never ate a better meal. He gave me
Burgundy on account of the bite in the weather, and afterwards I
had a glass of the Bristol Cream for which the club was famous;
but he drank water himself. There were four other people in the
room, all of whom he appeared to call by their Christian names,
and these lantern-jawed hunting fellows seemed to cheer up at the
sight of him. But they didn't come and stand beside him and talk,
which is apt to happen to your popular man. There was that about
Medina which was at once friendly and aloof, the air of a simple
but tremendous distinction.</p>

<p>I remember we began by talking about rifles. I had done a good
deal of shikar in my time, and I could see that this man had had
a wide experience and had the love of the thing in his bones. He
never bragged, but by little dropped remarks showed what a swell
he was. We talked of a new .240 bore which had remarkable
stopping power, and I said I had never used it on anything more
formidable than a Scotch stag. "It would have been a godsend to
me in the old days on the Pungwe where I had to lug about a .500
express that broke my back."</p>

<p>He grinned ruefully. "The old days!" he said. "We've all had
'em, and we're all sick to get 'em back. Sometimes I'm tempted to
kick over the traces and be off to the wilds again. I'm too young
to settle down. And you, Sir Richard--you must feel the same. Do
you never regret that that beastly old War is over?"</p>

<p>"I can't say I do. I'm a middle-aged man now and soon I'll be
stiff in the joints. I've settled down in the Cotswolds, and
though I hope to get a lot of sport before I die I'm not looking
for any more wars. I'm positive the Almighty meant me for a
farmer."</p>

<p>He laughed. "I wish I knew what He meant me for. It looks like
some sort of politician."</p>

<p>"Oh, you!" I said. "You're the fellow with twenty talents.
I've only got the one, and I'm jolly well going to bury it in the
soil."</p>

<p>I kept wondering how much help I would get out of him. I liked
him enormously, but somehow I didn't yet see his cleverness. He
was just an ordinary good fellow of my own totem--just such
another as Tom Greenslade. It was a dark day, and the firelight
silhouetted his profile, and as I stole glances at it I was
struck by the shape of his head. The way he brushed his hair
front and back made it look square, but I saw that it was really
round, the roundest head I have ever seen except in a Kaffir. He
was evidently conscious of it and didn't like it, so took some
pains to conceal it.</p>

<p>All through luncheon I was watching him covertly, and I could
see that he was also taking stock of me. Very friendly these blue
eyes were, but very shrewd. He suddenly looked me straight in the
face.</p>

<p>"You won't vegetate," he said. "You needn't deceive yourself.
You haven't got the kind of mouth for a rustic. What is it to be?
Politics? Business? Travel? You're well off?"</p>

<p>"Yes. For my simple tastes I'm rather rich. But I haven't the
ambition of a maggot."</p>

<p>"No. You haven't." He looked at me steadily. "If you don't
mind my saying it, you have too little vanity. Oh, I'm quick at
detecting vanity, and anyhow it's a thing that defies
concealment. But I imagine--indeed I know--that you can work like
a beaver, and that your loyalty is not the kind that cracks. You
won't be able to help yourself, Sir Richard. You'll be caught up
in some machine. Look at me. I swore two years ago never to have
a groove, and I'm in a deep one already. England is made up of
grooves, and the only plan is to select a good one."</p>

<p>"I suppose yours is politics," I said.</p>

<p>"I suppose it is. A dingy game as it's played at present, but
there are possibilities. There is a mighty Tory revival in sight,
and it will want leading. The newly enfranchised classes,
especially the women, will bring it about. The suffragists didn't
know what a tremendous force of conservatism they were releasing
when they won the vote for their sex. I should like to talk to
you about these things some day."</p>

<p>In the smoking-room we got back to sport and he told me the
story of how he met Greenslade in Central Asia. I was beginning
to realise that the man's reputation was justified, for there was
a curious mastery about his talk, a careless power as if
everything came easily to him and was just taken in his stride. I
had meant to open up the business which had made me seek his
acquaintance, but I did not feel the atmosphere quite right for
it. I did not know him well enough yet, and I felt that if I once
started on those ridiculous three facts, which were all I had, I
must make a clean breast of the whole thing and take him fully
into my confidence. I thought the time was scarcely ripe for
that, especially as we would meet again.</p>

<p>"Are you by any chance free on Thursday?" he asked as we
parted. "I would like to take you to dine at the Thursday Club.
You're sure to know some of the fellows, and it's a pleasant way
of spending an evening. That's capital! Eight o'clock on
Thursday. Short coat and black tie."</p>

<p>As I walked away, I made up my mind that I had found the right
kind of man to help me. I liked him, and the more I thought of
him the more the impression deepened of a big reservoir of power
behind his easy grace. I was completely fascinated, and the proof
of it was that I went off to the nearest bookseller's and bought
his two slim volumes of poems. I cared far more about poetry than
Macgillivray imagined--Mary had done a lot to educate me--but I
hadn't been very fortunate in my experiments with the new people.
But I understood Medina's verses well enough. They were very
simple, with a delicious subtle tune in them, and they were
desperately sad. Again and again came the note of regret and
transcience and disillusioned fortitude. As I read them that
evening I wondered how a man, who had apparently such zest for
life and got so much out of the world, should be so lonely at
heart. It might be a pose, but there was nothing of the
conventional despair of the callow poet. This was the work of one
as wise as Ulysses and as far-wandering. I didn't see how he
could want to write anything but the truth. A pose is a
consequence of vanity, and I was pretty clear that Medina was not
vain.</p>

<p>Next morning I found his cadences still running in my head and
I could not keep my thoughts off him. He fascinated me as a man
is fascinated by a pretty woman. I was glad to think that he had
taken a liking for me, for he had done far more than Greenslade's
casual introduction demanded. He had made a plan for us to meet
again, and he had spoken not as an acquaintance but as a friend.
Very soon I decided that I would get Macgillivray's permission
and take him wholly into our confidence. It was no good keeping a
man like that at arm's length and asking him to solve puzzles
presented as meaninglessly as an acrostic in a newspaper. He must
be told all or nothing, and I was certain that if he were told
all he would be a very tower of strength to me. The more I
thought of him the more I was convinced of his exceptional
brains.</p>

<p>I lunched with Mr. Julius Victor in Carlton House Terrace. He
was carrying on his ordinary life, and when he greeted me he
never referred to the business which had linked us together. Or
rather he only said one word. "I knew I could count on you," he
said. "I think I told you that my daughter was engaged to be
married this spring. Well, her fianc&eacute; has come over from
France and will be staying for an indefinite time with me. He can
probably do nothing to assist you, but he is here at your call if
you want him. He is the Marquis de la Tour du Pin."</p>

<p>I didn't quite catch the name, and, as it was a biggish party,
we had sat down to luncheon before I realised who the desolated
lover was. It was my ancient friend Turpin, who had been liaison
officer with my old division. I had known that he was some kind
of grandee, but as everybody went by nicknames I had become used
to think of him as Turpin, a version of his title invented, I
think, by Archie Roylance. There he was, sitting opposite me, a
very handsome pallid young man, dressed with that excessive
correctness found only among Frenchmen who get their clothes in
England. He had been a tremendous swashbuckler when he was with
the division, unbridled in speech, volcanic in action, but always
with a sad gentleness in his air. He raised his heavy-lidded eyes
and looked at me, and then, with a word of apology to his host,
marched round the table and embraced me.</p>

<p>I felt every kind of a fool, but I was mighty glad all the
same to see Turpin. He had been a good pal of mine, and the fact
that he had been going to marry Miss Victor seemed to bring my
new job in line with other parts of my life. But I had no further
speech with him, for I had conversational women on both sides of
me, and in the few minutes while the men were left alone at table
I fell into talk with an elderly man on my right, who proved to
be a member of the Cabinet. I found that out by a lucky accident,
for I was lamentably ill-informed about the government of our
country.</p>

<p>I asked him about Medina and he brightened up at once.</p>

<p>"Can you place him?" he asked. "I can't. I like to classify my
fellow-men, but he is a new specimen. He is as exotic as the
young Disraeli and as English as the late Duke of Devonshire. The
point is, has he a policy, something he wants to achieve, and has
he the power of attaching a party to him? If he has these two
things, there is no doubt about his future. Honestly, I'm not
quite certain. He has very great talents, and I believe if he
wanted he would be in the front rank as a public speaker. He has
the ear of the House, too, though he doesn't often address it.
But I am never sure how much he cares about the whole business,
and England, you know, demands wholeheartedness in her public
men. She will follow blindly the second-rate, if he is in
earnest, and reject the first-rate if he is not."</p>

<p>I said something about Medina's view of a great Tory revival,
based upon the women. My neighbour grinned.</p>

<p>"I dare say he's right, and I dare say he could whistle women
any way he pleased. It's extraordinary the charm he has for them.
That handsome face of his and that melodious voice would enslave
anything female from a charwoman to a Cambridge intellectual.
Half his power of course comes from the fact that they have no
charm for <i>him.</i> He's as aloof as Sir Galahad from any
interest in the sex. Did you ever hear his name coupled with a
young woman's? He goes everywhere and they would give their heads
for him, and all the while he is as insensitive as a nice Eton
boy whose only thought is of getting into the Eleven. You know
him?"</p>

<p>I told him, very slightly.</p>

<p>"Same with me. I've only a nodding acquaintance, but one can't
help feeling the man everywhere and being acutely interested.
It's lucky he's a sound fellow. If he were a rogue he could play
the devil with our easy-going society."</p>

<p>That night Sandy and I dined together. He had come back from
Scotland in good spirits, for his father's health was improving,
and when Sandy was in good spirits it was like being on the Downs
in a south-west wind. We had so much to tell each other that we
let our food grow cold. He had to hear all about Mary and Peter
John, and what I knew of Blenkiron and a dozen other old
comrades, and I had to get a sketch--the merest sketch--of his
doings since the Armistice in the East. Sandy for some reason was
at the moment disinclined to speak of his past, but he was as
ready as an undergraduate to talk of his future. He meant to stay
at home now, for a long spell at any rate; and the question was
how he should fill up his time. "Country life's no good," he
said. "I must find a profession or I'll get into trouble."</p>

<p>I suggested politics, and he rather liked the notion.</p>

<p>"I might be bored in Parliament," he reflected, "but I should
love the rough-and-tumble of an election. I only once took part
in one, and I discovered surprising gifts as a demagogue and made
a speech in our little town which is still talked about. The
chief row was about Irish Home Rule, and I thought I'd better
have a whack at the Pope. Has it ever struck you, Dick, that
ecclesiastical language has a most sinister sound? I knew some of
the words, though not their meaning, but I knew that my audience
would be just as ignorant. So I had a magnificent peroration.
'Will you men of Kilclavers,' I asked, 'endure to see a chasuble
set up in your market-place? Will you have your daughters sold
into simony? Will you have celibacy practised in the public
streets?' Gad, I had them all on their feet bellowing
'Never!'"</p>

<p>He also rather fancied business. He had a notion of taking up
civil aviation, and running a special service for transporting
pilgrims from all over the Moslem world to Mecca. He reckoned the
present average cost to the pilgrim at not less than &pound;30,
and believed that he could do it for an average of &pound;15 and
show a handsome profit. Blenkiron, he thought, might be
interested in the scheme and put up some of the capital.</p>

<p>But later, in a corner of the upstairs smoking-room, Sandy was
serious enough when I began to tell him the job I was on, for I
didn't need Macgillivray's permission to make a confidant of him.
He listened in silence while I gave him the main lines of the
business that I had gathered from Macgillivray's papers, and he
made no comment when I came to the story of the three hostages.
But, when I explained my disinclination to stir out of my country
rut, he began to laugh.</p>

<p>"It's a queer thing how people like us get a sudden passion
for cosiness. I feel it myself coming over me. What stirred you
up in the end? The little boy?"</p>

<p>Then very lamely and shyly I began on the rhymes and
Greenslade's memory. That interested him acutely. "Just the sort
of sensible-nonsensical notion you'd have, Dick. Go on. I'm
thrilled."</p>

<p>But when I came to Medina he exclaimed sharply.</p>

<p>"You've met him?"</p>

<p>"Yesterday at luncheon."</p>

<p>"You haven't told him anything?"</p>

<p>"No. But I'm going to."</p>

<p>Sandy had been deep in an arm-chair with his legs over the
side, but now he got up and stood with his arms on the
mantelpiece looking into the fire.</p>

<p>"I'm going to take him into my full confidence," I said, "when
I've spoken to Macgillivray."</p>

<p>"Macgillivray will no doubt agree?"</p>

<p>"And you? Have you ever met him?"</p>

<p>"Never. But of course I've heard of him. Indeed I don't mind
telling you that one of my chief reasons for coming home was a
wish to see Medina."</p>

<p>"You'll like him tremendously. I never met such a man."</p>

<p>"So everyone says." He turned his face and I could see that it
had fallen into that portentous gravity which was one of Sandy's
moods, the complement to his ordinary insouciance. "When are you
going to see him again?"</p>

<p>"I'm dining with him the day after to-morrow at a thing called
the Thursday Club."</p>

<p>"Oh, he belongs to that, does he? So do I. I think I'll give
myself the pleasure of dining also."</p>

<p>I asked about the Club, and he told me that it had been
started after the War by some of the people who had had queer
jobs and wanted to keep together. It was very small, only twenty
members. There were Collatt, one of the Q-boat V.C.'s, and Pugh
of the Indian Secret Service, and the Duke of Burminster, and Sir
Arthur Warcliff, and several soldiers all more or less
well-known. "They elected me in 1919," said Sandy, "but of course
I've never been to a dinner. I say, Dick, Medina must have a
pretty strong pull here to be a member of the Thursday. Though I
says it as shouldn't, it's a show most people would give their
right hand to be in."</p>

<p>He sat down again and appeared to reflect, with his chin on
his hand.</p>

<p>"You're under the spell, I suppose," he said.</p>

<p>"Utterly. I'll tell you how he strikes me. Your ordinary very
clever man is apt to be a bit bloodless and priggish, while your
ordinary sportsman and good fellow is inclined to be a bit
narrow. Medina seems to me to combine all the virtues and none of
the faults of both kinds. Anybody can see he's a sportsman, and
you've only to ask the swells to discover how high they put his
brains."</p>

<p>"He sounds rather too good to be true." I seemed to detect a
touch of acidity in his voice. "Dick," he said, looking very
serious, "I want you to promise to go slow in this business--I
mean about telling Medina."</p>

<p>"Why?" I asked. "Have you anything against him?"</p>

<p>"No--o--o," he said. "I haven't anything against him. But he's
just a little incredible, and I would like to know more about
him. I had a friend who knew him. I've no right to say this, and
I haven't any evidence, but I've a sort of feeling that Medina
didn't do him any good."</p>

<p>"What was his name?" I asked, and was told "Lavater"; and when
I inquired what had become of him Sandy didn't know. He had lost
sight of him for two years.</p>

<p>At that I laughed heartily, for I could see what was the
matter. Sandy was jealous of this man who was putting a spell on
everybody. He wanted his old friends to himself. When I taxed him
with it he grinned and didn't deny it.</p>

<p> </p>

<h1><a name="c05">CHAPTER V</a></h1>

<h1>THE THURSDAY CLUB</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>We met in a room on the second floor of a little restaurant in
Mervyn Street, a pleasant room, panelled in white, with big fires
burning at each end. The Club had its own cook and butler, and I
swear a better dinner was never produced in London, starting with
preposterously early plovers' eggs and finishing with fruit from
Burminster's houses. There were a dozen present including myself,
and of these, besides my host, I knew only Burminster and Sandy.
Collatt was there, and Pugh, and a wizened little man who had
just returned from bird-hunting at the mouth of the Mackenzie.
There was Palliser-Yeates, the banker, who didn't look thirty,
and Fulleylove, the Arabian traveller, who was really thirty and
looked fifty. I was specially interested in Nightingale, a slim
peering fellow with double glasses, who had gone back to Greek
manuscripts and his Cambridge fellowship after captaining a
Bedouin tribe. Leithen was there, too, the Attorney-General, who
had been a private in the Guards at the start of the War, and had
finished up a G.S.O.I., a toughly built man, with a pale face and
very keen quizzical eyes. I should think there must have been
more varied and solid brains in that dozen than you would find in
an average Parliament.</p>

<p>Sandy was the last to arrive, and was greeted with a roar of
joy. Everybody seemed to want to wring his hand and beat him on
the back. He knew them all except Medina, and I was curious to
see their meeting. Burminster did the introducing, and Sandy for
a moment looked shy. "I've been looking forward to this for
years," Medina said, and Sandy, after one glance at him, grinned
sheepishly and stammered something polite.</p>

<p>Burminster was chairman for the evening, a plump, jolly little
man, who had been a pal of Archie Roylance in the Air Force. The
talk to begin with was nothing out of the common. It started with
horses and the spring handicaps, and then got on to spring
salmon-fishing, for one man had been on the Helmsdale, another on
the Naver, and two on the Tay. The fashion of the Club was to
have the conversation general, and there was very little talking
in groups. I was next to Medina, between him and the Duke, and
Sandy was at the other end of the oval table. He had not much to
say, and more than once I caught his eyes watching Medina.</p>

<p>Then by and by, as was bound to happen, reminiscences began.
Collatt made me laugh with a story of how the Admiralty had a
notion that sea-lions might be useful to detect submarines. A
number were collected, and trained to swim after submarines to
which fish were attached as bait, the idea being that they would
come to associate the smell of submarines with food, and go after
a stranger. The thing shipwrecked on the artistic temperament.
The beasts all came from the music-halls and had names like
Flossie and Cissie, so they couldn't be got to realise that there
was a war on, and were always going ashore without leave.</p>

<p>That story started the ball rolling, and by the time we had
reached the port the talk was like what you used to find in the
smoking-room of an East African coastal steamer, only a million
times better. Everybody present had done and seen amazing things,
and, moreover, they had the brains and knowledge to orientate
their experiences. It was no question of a string of yarns, but
rather of the best kind of give-and-take conversation, when a man
would buttress an argument by an apt recollection. I especially
admired Medina. He talked little, but he made others talk, and
his keen interest seemed to wake the best in everybody. I noticed
that, as at our luncheon three days before, he drank only
water.</p>

<p>We talked, I remember, about the people who had gone missing,
and whether any were likely still to turn up. Sandy told us about
three British officers who had been in prison in Turkestan since
the summer of '18 and had only just started home. He had met one
of them at Marseilles, and thought there might be others tucked
away in those parts. Then someone spoke of how it was possible to
drop off the globe for a bit and miss all that was happening. I
said I had met an old prospector in Barberton in 1920 who had
come down from Portuguese territory and when I asked him what he
had been doing in the War, he said "What war?" Pugh said a fellow
had just turned up in Hong Kong, who had been a captive of
Chinese pirates for eight years and had never heard a word of our
four years' struggle, till he said something about the Kaiser to
the skipper of the boat that picked him up.</p>

<p>Then Sandy, as the new-comer, wanted news about Europe. I
remember that Leithen gave him his views on the <i>malaise</i>
that France was suffering from, and that Palliser-Yeates, who
looked exactly like a Rugby three-quarter back, enlightened
him--and incidentally myself--on the matter of German
reparations. Sandy was furious about the muddle in the Near East
and the mishandling of Turkey. His view was that we were doing
our best to hammer a much-divided Orient into a hostile
unanimity.</p>

<p>"Lord!" he cried, "how I loathe our new manners in foreign
policy. The old English way was to regard all foreigners as
slightly childish and rather idiotic and ourselves as the only
grown-ups in a kindergarten world. That meant that we had a cool
detached view and did even-handed unsympathetic justice. But now
we have got into the nursery ourselves and are bear-fighting on
the floor. We take violent sides, and make pets, and of course if
you are <i>-phil</i> something or other you have got to be
<i>-phobe</i> something else. It is all wrong. We are becoming
Balkanised."</p>

<p>We would have drifted into politics, if Pugh had not asked him
his opinion of Gandhi. That led him into an exposition of the
meaning of the fanatic, a subject on which he was well qualified
to speak, for he had consorted with most varieties.</p>

<p>"He is always in the technical sense mad--that is, his mind is
tilted from its balance, and since we live by balance he is a
wrecker, a crowbar in the machinery. His power comes from the
appeal he makes to the imperfectly balanced, and as these are
never the majority his appeal is limited. But there is one kind
of fanatic whose strength comes from balance, from a lunatic
balance. You cannot say that there is any one thing abnormal
about him, for he is all abnormal. He is as balanced as you or
me, but, so to speak, in a fourth-dimensional world. That kind of
man has no logical gaps in his creed. Within his insane
postulates he is brilliantly sane. Take Lenin for instance.
That's the kind of fanatic I'm afraid of."</p>

<p>Leithen asked how such a man got his influence. "You say that
there is no crazy spot in him which appeals to a crazy spot in
other people."</p>

<p>"He appeals to the normal," said Sandy solemnly, "to the
perfectly sane. He offers reason, not visions--in any case his
visions are reasonable. In ordinary times he will not be heard,
because, as I say, his world is not our world. But let there come
a time of great suffering or discontent, when the mind of the
ordinary man is in desperation, and the rational fanatic will
come by his own. When he appeals to the sane and the sane
respond, revolutions begin."</p>

<p>Pugh nodded his head, as if he agreed. "Your fanatic of course
must be a man of genius."</p>

<p>"Of course. And genius of that kind is happily rare. When it
exists, its possessor is the modern wizard. The old necromancer
fiddled away with cabalistic signs and crude chemicals and got
nowhere; the true wizard is the man who works by spirit on
spirit. We are only beginning to realise the strange crannies of
the human soul. The real magician, if he turned up to-day,
wouldn't bother about drugs and dopes. He would dabble in far
more deadly methods, the compulsion of a fiery nature over the
limp things that men call their minds."</p>

<p>He turned to Pugh. "You remember the man we used to call Ram
Dass in the War--I never knew his right name?"</p>

<p>"Rather," said Pugh. "The fellow who worked for us in San
Francisco. He used to get big sums from the agitators and pay
them in to the British Exchequer, less his commission of ten per
cent."</p>

<p>"Stout fellow!" Burminster exclaimed approvingly. "Well, Ram
Dass used to discourse to me on this subject. He was as wise as a
serpent and as loyal as a dog, and he saw a lot of things coming
that we are just beginning to realise. He said that the great
offensives of the future would be psychological, and he thought
the Governments should get busy about it and prepare their
defence. What a jolly sight it would be--all the high officials
sitting down to little primers! But there was sense in what he
said. He considered that the most deadly weapon in the world was
the power of mass-persuasion, and he wanted to meet it at the
source, by getting at the mass-persuader. His view was that every
spell-binder had got something like Samson's hair which was the
key of his strength, and that if this were tampered with he could
be made innocuous. He would have had us make pets of the prophets
and invite them to Government House. You remember the winter of
1917 when the Bolsheviks were making trouble in Afghanistan and
their stuff was filtering through into India. Well, Ram Dass
claimed the credit of stopping that game by his psychological
dodges."</p>

<p>He looked across suddenly at Medina. "You know the Frontier.
Did you ever come across the <i>guru</i> that lived at the foot
of the Shansi pass as you go over to Kaikand?"</p>

<p>Medina shook his head. "I never travelled that way. Why?"</p>

<p>Sandy seemed disappointed. "Ram Dass used to speak of him. I
hoped you might have met him."</p>

<p>The club madeira was being passed round, and there was a
little silence while we sipped it. It was certainly a marvellous
wine, and I noticed with pain Medina's abstinence.</p>

<p>"You really are missing a lot, you know," Burminster boomed in
his jolly voice, and for a second all the company looked Medina's
way.</p>

<p>He smiled and lifted his glass of water.</p>

<p>"<i>Sit vini abstemius qui hermeneuma tentat aut hominum petit
dominatum,"</i> he said.</p>

<p>Nightingale translated. "Meaning that you must be pussyfoot if
you would be a big man."</p>

<p>There was a chorus of protests, and Medina again lifted his
glass.</p>

<p>"I'm only joking. I haven't a scrap of policy or principle in
the matter. I don't happen to like the stuff--that's all."</p>

<p>I fancy that the only two scholars among us were Nightingale
and Sandy. I looked at the latter and was surprised by the change
in his face. It had awakened to the most eager interest. His
eyes, which had been staring at Medina, suddenly met mine, and I
read in them not only interest but disquiet.</p>

<p>Burminster was delivering a spirited defence of Bacchus, and
the rest joined in, but Sandy took the other side.</p>

<p>"There's a good deal in that Latin tag," he said. "There are
places in the world where total abstinence is reckoned a
privilege. Did you ever come across the Ulai tribe up the
Karakoram way?" He was addressing Medina. "No? Well, the next
time you meet a man in the Guides ask him about them, for they're
a curiosity. They're Mahommedan and so should by rights be
abstainers, but they're a drunken set of sweeps, and the most
priest-ridden community on earth. Drinking is not only a habit
among them, it's an obligation, and their weekly <i>tamasha</i>
would make Falstaff take the pledge. But their priests--they're a
kind of theocracy--are strict teetotal. It is their privilege and
the secret of their power. When one of them has to be degraded he
is filled compulsorily full of wine. That's your--how does the
thing go?--your '<i>hominum dominatus</i>.'"</p>

<p>From that moment I found the evening go less pleasantly.
Medina was as genial as ever, but something seemed to have
affected Sandy's temper and he became positively grumpy. Now and
then he contradicted a man too sharply for good manners, but for
the most part he was silent, smoking his pipe and answering his
neighbours in monosyllables. About eleven I began to feel it was
time to leave, and Medina was of the same opinion. He asked me to
walk with him, and I gladly accepted, for I did not feel inclined
to go to bed.</p>

<p>As I was putting on my coat, Sandy came up. "Come to the Club,
Dick," he said. "I want to talk to you." His manner was so
peremptory that I opened my eyes.</p>

<p>"Sorry," I said. "I've promised to walk home with Medina."</p>

<p>"Oh, damn Medina!" he said. "Do as I ask or you'll be sorry
for it."</p>

<p>I wasn't feeling very pleased with Sandy, especially as Medina
was near enough to hear what he said. So I told him rather coldly
that I didn't intend to go back on my arrangement. He turned and
marched out, cannoning at the doorway into Burminster, to whom he
did not apologise. That nobleman rubbed his shoulder ruefully.
"Old Sandy hasn't got used to his corn yet," he laughed. "Looks
as if the madeira had touched up his liver."</p>

<p>It was a fine still March night with a good moon, and as we
walked along Piccadilly I was feeling cheerful. The good dinner I
had eaten and the good wine I had drunk played their part in this
mood, and there was also the satisfaction of having dined with
good fellows and having been admitted into pretty select company.
I felt my liking for Medina enormously increase, and I had the
unworthy sense of superiority which a man gets from seeing an old
friend whom he greatly admires behave rather badly. I was
considering what had ailed Sandy when Medina raised the
subject.</p>

<p>"A wonderful fellow Arbuthbot," he said. "I have wanted to
meet him for years, and he is certainly up to my expectations.
But he has been quite long enough abroad. A mind as keen as his,
if it doesn't have the company of its equals, is in danger of
getting viewy. What he said to-night was amazingly interesting,
but I thought it a little fantastic."</p>

<p>I agreed, but the hint of criticism was enough to revive my
loyalty. "All the same there's usually something in his most
extravagant theories. I've seen him right when all the sober
knowledgeable people were wrong."</p>

<p>"That I can well believe," he said. "You know him well?"</p>

<p>"Pretty well. We've been in some queer places together."</p>

<p>The memory of those queer places came back to me as we walked
across Berkeley Square. The West End of London at night always
affected me with a sense of the immense solidity of our
civilisation. These great houses, lit and shuttered and secure,
seemed the extreme opposite of the world of half-lights and
perils in which I had sometimes journeyed. I thought of them as I
thought of Fosse Manor, as sanctuaries of peace. But to-night I
felt differently towards them. I wondered what was going on at
the back of those heavy doors. Might not terror and mystery lurk
behind that barricade as well as in tent and slum? I suddenly had
a picture of a plump face all screwed up with fright muffled
beneath the bed-clothes.</p>

<p>I had imagined that Medina lived in chambers or a flat, but we
stopped before a substantial house in Hill Street.</p>

<p>"You're coming in? The night's young and there's time for a
pipe."</p>

<p>I had no wish to go to bed, so I followed him as he opened the
front door with a latch-key. He switched on a light, which lit
the first landing of the staircase but left the hall in dusk. It
seemed to be a fine place full of cabinets, the gilding of which
flickered dimly. We ascended thickly-carpeted stairs, and on the
landing he switched off the first light and switched on another
which lit a further flight. I had the sensation of mounting to a
great height in a queer shadowy world.</p>

<p>"This is a big house for a bachelor," I observed.</p>

<p>"I've a lot of stuff, books and pictures and things, and I
like it round me."</p>

<p>He opened a door and ushered me into an enormous room, which
must have occupied the whole space on that floor. It was oblong,
with deep bays at each end, and it was lined from floor to
ceiling with books. Books, too, were piled on the tables, and
sprawled on a big flat couch which was drawn up before the fire.
It wasn't an ordinary gentleman's library, provided by the
bookseller at so much a yard. It was the working collection of a
scholar, and the books had that used look which makes them the
finest tapestry for a room. The place was lit with lights on
small tables, and on a big desk under a reading lamp were masses
of papers and various volumes with paper slips in them. It was
workshop as well as library.</p>

<p>A servant entered, unsummoned, and put a tray of drinks on a
side table. He was dressed like an ordinary butler, but I guessed
that he had not spent much of his life in service. The heavy
jowl, the small eyes, the hair cut straight round the nape of the
neck, the swollen muscles about the shoulder and upper arm told
me the profession he had once followed. The man had been in the
ring, and not so very long ago. I wondered at Medina's choice,
for a pug is not the kind of servant I would choose myself.</p>

<p>"Nothing more, Odell," said Medina. "You can go to bed. I will
let Sir Richard out."</p>

<p>He placed me in a long arm-chair, and held the syphon while I
mixed myself a very weak whisky-and-soda. Then he sat opposite me
across the hearth-rug in a tall old-fashioned chair which he
pulled forward from his writing-table. The servant in leaving had
turned out all the lights except one at his right hand, which
vividly lit up his face, and which, since the fire had burned
low, made the only bright patch in the room. I stretched my legs
comfortably and puffed at my pipe, wondering how I would have the
energy to get up and go home. The long dim shelves, where creamy
vellum and morocco ran out of the dusk into darkness, had an odd
effect on me. I was visited again by the fancies which had
occupied me coming through Berkeley Square. I was inside one of
those massive sheltered houses, and lo and behold! it was as
mysterious as the aisles of a forest. Books--books--old books
full of forgotten knowledge! I was certain that if I had the
scholarship to search the grave rows I would find out wonderful
things.</p>

<p>I was thirsty, so I drank off my whisky-and-soda, and was just
adding a little more soda-water from the syphon at my elbow, when
I looked towards Medina. There was that in his appearance which
made me move my glass so that a thin stream of liquid fell on my
sleeve. The patch was still damp next morning.</p>

<p>His face, brilliantly lit up by the lamp, seemed to be also
lit from within. It was not his eyes or any one feature that
enthralled me, for I did not notice any details. Only the odd
lighting seemed to detach his head from its environment so that
it hung in the air like a planet in the sky, full of intense
brilliance and power.</p>

<p>It is not very easy to write down what happened. For twelve
hours afterwards I remembered nothing--only that I had been very
sleepy, and must have been poor company and had soon got up to
go. . . . But that was not the real story: it was what the man
had willed that I should remember, and because my own will was
not really mastered I remembered other things in spite of him;
remembered them hazily, like a drunkard's dream.</p>

<p>The head seemed to swim in the centre of pale converging
lines. These must have been the book-shelves, which in that part
of the room were full of works bound in old vellum. My eyes were
held by two violet pin-points of light which were so bright that
they hurt me. I tried to shift my gaze, but I could only do that
by screwing round my head towards the dying fire. The movement
demanded a great effort, for every muscle in my body seemed
drugged with lethargy.</p>

<p>As soon as I looked away from the light I regained some
possession of my wits. I felt that I must be in for some
sickness, and had a moment of bad fright. It seemed to be my
business to keep my eyes on the shadows in the hearth, for where
darkness was there I found some comfort. I was as afraid of the
light before me as a child of a bogy. I thought that if I said
something I should feel better, but I didn't seem to have the
energy to get a word out. Curiously enough I felt no fear of
Medina; he didn't seem to be in the business; it was that
disembodied light that scared me.</p>

<p>Then I heard a voice speaking, but still I didn't think of
Medina.</p>

<p>"Hannay," it said. "You are Richard Hannay?"</p>

<p>Against my will I slewed my eyes round, and there hung that
intolerable light burning into my eyeballs and my soul. I found
my voice now, for it seemed to be screwed out of me, and I said
"Yes" like an automaton.</p>

<p>I felt my wits and my sense slipping away under that glare.
But my main discomfort was physical, the flaming control of the
floating brightness--not face, or eyes, but a dreadful
overmastering aura. I thought--if at that moment you could call
any process of my mind thought--that if I could only link it on
to some material thing I should find relief. With a desperate
effort I seemed to make out the line of a man's shoulder and the
back of a chair. Let me repeat that I never thought of Medina,
for he had been wiped clean out of my world.</p>

<p>"You are Richard Hannay," said the voice. "Repeat, 'I am
Richard Hannay.'"</p>

<p>The words came out of my mouth involuntarily. I was
concentrating all my wits on the comforting outline of the
chair-back, which was beginning to be less hazy.</p>

<p>The voice spoke again.</p>

<p>"But till this moment you have been nothing. There was no
Richard Hannay before. Now, when I bid you, you begin your life.
You remember nothing. You have no past."</p>

<p>"I remember nothing," said my voice, but as I spoke I knew I
lied, and that knowledge was my salvation.</p>

<p>I have been told more than once by doctors who dabbled in the
business that I was the most hopeless subject for hypnotism that
they ever struck. One of them once said that I was about as
unsympathetic as Table Mountain. I must suppose that the
intractable bedrock of commonplaceness in me now met the
something which was striving to master me and repelled it. I felt
abominably helpless, my voice was not my own, my eyes were
tortured and aching, but I had recovered my mind.</p>

<p>I seemed to be repeating a lesson at someone's dictation. I
said I was Richard Hannay, who had just come from South Africa on
his first visit to England. I knew no one in London and had no
friends. Had I heard of a Colonel Arbuthnot? I had not. Or the
Thursday Club? I had not. Or the War? Yes, but I had been in
Angola most of the time and had never fought. I had money? Yes, a
fair amount, which was in such-and-such a bank and such-and-such
investments. . . . I went on repeating the stuff as glibly as a
parrot, but all the while I knew I lied. Something deep down in
me was insisting that I was Sir Richard Hannay, K.C.B., who had
commanded a division in France, and was the squire of Fosse
Manor, the husband of Mary, and the father of Peter John.</p>

<p>Then the voice seemed to give orders. I was to do this and
that, and I repeated them docilely. I was no longer in the least
scared. Someone or something was trying to play monkey-tricks
with my mind, but I was master of that, though my voice seemed to
belong to an alien gramophone, and my limbs were stupidly weak. I
wanted above all things to be allowed to sleep. . . .</p>

<p>I think I must have slept for a little, for my last
recollection of that queer sederunt is that the unbearable light
had gone, and the ordinary lamps of the room were switched on.
Medina was standing by the dead fire, and another man beside
him--a slim man with a bent back and a lean grey face. The second
man was only there for a moment, but he looked at me closely and
I thought Medina spoke to him and laughed. . . . Then I was being
helped by Medina into my coat, and conducted downstairs. There
were two bright lights in the street which made me want to lie
down on the kerb and sleep. . . .</p>

<p align="CENTER">*****</p>

<p>I woke about ten o'clock next morning in my bedroom at the
Club, feeling like nothing on earth. I had a bad headache, my
eyes seemed to be backed with white fire, and my legs were full
of weak pains as if I had influenza. It took me several minutes
to realise where I was, and when I wondered what had brought me
to such a state I could remember nothing. Only a preposterous
litany ran in my brain--the name "Dr. Newhover," and an address
in Wimpole Street. I concluded glumly that that for a man in my
condition was a useful recollection, but where I had got it I
hadn't an idea.</p>

<p>The events of the night before were perfectly clear. I
recalled every detail of the Thursday Club dinner, Sandy's
brusqueness, my walk back with Medina, my admiration of his great
library. I remembered that I had been drowsy there and thought
that I had probably bored him. But I was utterly at a loss to
account for my wretched condition. It could not have been the
dinner; or the wine, for I had not drunk much, and in any case I
have a head like cast iron; or the weak whisky-and-soda in
Medina's house. I staggered to my feet and looked at my tongue in
the glass. It was all right, so there could be nothing the matter
with my digestion.</p>

<p>You are to understand that the account I have just written was
pieced together as events came back to me, and that at 10 a.m.
the next morning I remembered nothing of it--nothing but the
incidents up to my sitting down in Medina's library, and the name
and address of a doctor I had never heard of. I concluded that I
must have got some infernal germ, probably botulism, and was in
for a bad illness. I wondered dismally what kind of fool I had
made of myself before Medina, and still more dismally what was
going to happen to me. I decided to wire for Mary when I had seen
a doctor, and to get as soon as possible into a nursing home. I
had never had an illness in my life, except malaria, and I was as
nervous as a cat.</p>

<p>But after I had had a cup of tea I felt a little better, and
inclined to get up. A cold bath relieved my headache, and I was
able to shave and dress. It was while I was shaving that I
observed the first thing which made me puzzle about the events of
the previous evening. The valet who attended to me had put out
the contents of my pockets on the dressing-table--my keys, watch,
loose silver, notecase, and my pipe and pouch. Now I carry my
pipe in a little leather case, and, being very punctilious in my
habits, I invariably put it back in the case when it is empty.
But the case was not there, though I remembered laying it on the
table beside me in Medina's room, and, moreover, the pipe was
still half full of unsmoked tobacco. I rang for the man, and
learned that he had found the pipe in the pocket of my dinner
jacket, but no case. He was positive, for he knew my ways and had
been surprised to find my pipe so untidily pocketed.</p>

<p>I had a light breakfast in the coffee-room, and as I ate it I
kept wondering as to what exactly I had been doing the night
before. Odd little details were coming back to me; in particular,
a recollection of some great effort which had taken all the
strength out of me. Could I have been drugged? Not the Thursday
Club madeira. Medina's whisky-and-soda?</p>

<p>The idea was nonsense; in any case a drugged man does not have
a clean tongue the next morning.</p>

<p>I interviewed the night porter, for I thought he might have
something to tell me.</p>

<p>"Did you notice what hour I came home last night?" I
asked.</p>

<p>"It was this morning, Sir Richard," the man replied, with the
suspicion of a grin. "About half-past three, it would be, or
twenty minutes to four."</p>

<p>"God bless my soul!" I exclaimed. "I had no notion it was so
late. I sat up talking with a friend."</p>

<p>"You must have been asleep in the car, Sir Richard, for the
chauffeur had to wake you, and you were that drowsy I thought I'd
better take you upstairs myself. The bedrooms on the top floor is
not that easy found."</p>

<p>"I didn't drop a pipe case?" I asked.</p>

<p>"No, sir." The man's discreet face revealed that he thought I
had been dining too well but was not inclined to blame me for
it.</p>

<p>By luncheon-time I had decided that I was not going to be ill,
for there was no longer anything the matter with my body except a
certain stiffness in the joints and the ghost of a headache
behind my eyes. But my mind was in a precious confusion. I had
stayed in Medina's room till after three, and had not been
conscious of anything that happened there after, say, half-past
eleven. I had left finally in such a state that I had forgotten
my pipe-case, and had arrived at the Club in somebody's
car--probably Medina's--so sleepy that I had to be escorted
upstairs, and had awoke so ill that I thought I had botulism.
What in Heaven's name had happened?</p>

<p>I fancy that the fact that I had resisted the influence
brought to bear on me with my <i>mind,</i> though tongue and
limbs had been helpless, enabled me to remember what the wielder
of the influence had meant to be forgotten. At any rate bits of
that strange scene began to come back. I remembered the uncanny
brightness--remembered it not with fear but with acute
indignation. I vaguely recalled that I had repeated nonsense to
somebody's dictation, but what it was I could not yet remember.
The more I thought of it the angrier I grew. Medina must have
been responsible, though to connect him with it seemed ridiculous
when I thought of what I had seen of him. Had he been making me
the subject of some scientific experiment? If so, it was infernal
impertinence. Anyhow it had failed--that was a salve to my
pride--for I had kept my head through it. The doctor had been
right who had compared me with Table Mountain.</p>

<p>I had got thus far in my reflections, when I recollected that
which put a different complexion on the business. Suddenly I
remembered the circumstances in which I had made Medina's
acquaintance. From him Tom Greenslade had heard the three facts
which fitted in with the jingle which was the key to the mystery
that I was sworn to unravel. Hitherto I had never thought of this
dazzling figure except as an ally. Was it possible that he might
be an enemy? The turn-about was too violent for my mind to
achieve it in one movement. I swore to myself that Medina was
straight, that it was sheer mania to believe that a gentleman and
a sportsman could ever come within hailing distance of the
hideous underworld which Macgillivray had revealed to me. . . .
But Sandy had not quite taken to him. . . . I thanked my stars
that anyhow I had said nothing to him about my job. I did not
really believe that there was any doubt about him, but I realised
that I must walk very carefully.</p>

<p>And then another idea came to me. Hypnotism had been tried on
me, and it had failed. But those who tried it must believe from
my behaviour that it had succeeded. If so, somehow and somewhere
they would act on that belief. It was my business to encourage
it. I was sure enough of myself to think that, now I was
forewarned, no further hypnotic experiments could seriously
affect me. But let them show their game, let me pretend to be
helpless wax in their hands. Who "they" were I had still to find
out.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>I had a great desire to get hold of Sandy and talk it over,
but though I rung up several of his lairs I could not find him.
Then I decided to see Dr. Newhover, for I was certain that that
name had come to me out of the medley of last night. So I
telephoned and made an appointment with him for that afternoon,
and four o'clock saw me starting out to walk to Wimpole
Street.</p>

<h1><a name="c06">CHAPTER VI</a></h1>

<h1>THE HOUSE IN GOSPEL OAK</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>It was a dry March afternoon, with one of those fantastic
winds which seem to change their direction hourly, and contrive
to be in a man's face at every street corner. The dust was
swirling in the gutters, and the scent of hyacinth and narcissus
from the flower-shops was mingled with that bleak sandy smell
which is London's foretaste of spring. As I crossed Oxford Street
I remember thinking what an odd pointless business I had drifted
into. I saw nothing for it but to continue drifting and see what
happened. I was on my way to visit a doctor of whom I knew
nothing, about some ailment which I was not conscious of
possessing. I didn't even trouble to make a plan, being content
to let chance have the guiding of me.</p>

<p>The house was one of those solid dreary erections which have
usually the names of half a dozen doctors on their front doors.
But in this case there was only one--Dr. M. Newhover. The
parlourmaid took me into the usual drab waiting-room furnished
with Royal Academy engravings, fumed oak, and an assortment of
belated picture-papers, and almost at once she returned and
ushered me into the consulting-room. This again was of the most
ordinary kind--glazed bookcases, wash-hand basin in a corner,
roll-top desk, a table with a medical journal or two and some
leather cases. And Dr. Newhover at first sight seemed nothing out
of the common. He was a youngish man, with high cheek-bones, a
high forehead, and a quantity of blond hair brushed straight back
from it. He wore a <i>pince-nez,</i> and when he removed it
showed pale prominent blue eyes. From his look I should have said
that his father had called himself Neuhofer.</p>

<p>He greeted me with a manner which seemed to me to be at once
patronising and dictatorial. I wondered if he was some tremendous
swell in his profession, of whom I ought to have heard. "Well,
Mr. Hannay, what can I do for you?" he said. I noticed that he
called me "Mr.," though I had given "Sir Richard" both on the
telephone and to the parlourmaid. It occurred to me that someone
had already been speaking of me to him, and that he had got the
name wrong in his memory.</p>

<p>I thought I had better expound the alarming symptoms with
which I had awakened that morning.</p>

<p>"I don't know what's gone wrong with me," I said. "I've a pain
behind my eyeballs, and my whole head seems muddled up. I feel
drowsy and slack, and I've got a weakness in my legs and back
like a man who has just had 'flu."</p>

<p>He made me sit down and proceeded to catechise me about my
health. I said it had been good enough, but I mentioned my old
malaria and several concussions, and I pretended to be pretty
nervous about my condition. Then he went through the whole bag of
tricks--sounding me with a stethoscope, testing my blood
pressure, and hitting me hard below the knee to see if I reacted.
I had to play up to my part, but upon my soul I came near
reacting too vigorously to some of his questions and boxing his
ears. Always he kept up that odd, intimate, domineering, rather
offensive manner.</p>

<p>He made me lie down on a couch while he fingered the muscles
of my neck and shoulder and seemed to be shampooing my head with
his long chilly hands. I was by this time feeling rather extra
well, but I managed to invent little tendernesses here and there
and a lot of alarming mental aberrations. I wondered if he were
not getting suspicious, for he asked abruptly: "Have you had
these symptoms long?" so I thought it better to return to the
truth, and told him "only since this morning."</p>

<p>At last he bade me get up, took off the tortoise-shell
spectacles he had been wearing and resumed his <i>pince-nez,</i>
and while I was buttoning my collar seemed to be sunk in
reflection. He made me sit in the patient's chair, and stood up
and looked down on me with a magisterial air that made me want to
laugh.</p>

<p>"You are suffering," he said, "from a somewhat abnormal form
of a common enough complaint. Just as the effects of a concussion
are often manifest only some days after the blow, so the results
of nervous strain may take a long time to develop. I have no
doubt that in spite of your good health you have during recent
years been working your mind and body at an undue pressure, and
now this morning quite suddenly you reap the fruits. I don't want
to frighten you, Mr. Hannay, but neurosis is so mysterious a
disease in its working that we must take it seriously, especially
at its first manifestations. There are one or two points in your
case which I am not happy about. There is, for example, a certain
congestion--or what seems to me a congestion--in the nerve
centres of the neck and head. That may be induced by the
accidents--concussion and the like--which you have told me of, or
it may not. The true cure must, of course, take time, and rest
and change of scene are obligatory. You are fond of sport? A
fisherman?"</p>

<p>I told him I was.</p>

<p>"Well, a little later I may prescribe a salmon river in
Norway. The remoteness of the life from ordinary existence and
the contemplation of swift running water have had wonderful
results with some of my patients. But Norway is not possible till
May, and in the meantime I am going to order you specific
treatment. Yes. I mean massage, but by no means ordinary massage.
That science is still in its infancy, and its practitioners are
only fumbling at the doorway. But now and then we find a person,
man or woman, with a kind of extra sense for disentangling and
smoothing out muscular and nervous abnormalities. I am going to
send you to such an one. The address may surprise you, but you
are man of the world enough to know that medical skill is not
confined to the area between Oxford Street and the Marylebone
Road." He took off his glasses, and smiled.</p>

<p>Then he wrote something on a slip of paper and handed it to
me. I read "Madame Breda, 4 Palmyra Square, N.W."</p>

<p>"Right!" I said. "Much obliged to you. I hope Madame Breda
will cure this infernal headache. When can I see her?"</p>

<p>"I can promise you she will cure the headache. She is a
Swedish lady who has lived in London since the War, and is so
much an enthusiast in her art that she will only now and then
take a private patient. For the most part she gives her skill
free to the children's hospitals. But she will not refuse me. As
for beginning, I should lose no time for the sake of your own
comfort. What about to-morrow morning?"</p>

<p>"Why not to-night? I have nothing to do, and I want to be quit
of my headache before bedtime. Why shouldn't I go on there
now?"</p>

<p>"No reason in the world. But I must make an appointment.
Madame is on the telephone. Excuse me a moment."</p>

<p>He left the room and returned in a few minutes to say that he
had made an appointment for seven o'clock. "It is an outlandish
place to get to, but most taxi-drivers know it. If your man
doesn't, tell him to drive to Gospel Oak, and then any policeman
will direct you."</p>

<p>I had my cheque-book with me, but he didn't want his fee,
saying that he was not done with me. I was to come back in a week
and report progress. As I left I had a strong impression of a
hand as cold as a snake, pale bulging eyes, and cheekbones like a
caricature of a Scotchman. An odd but rather impressive figure
was Dr. Newhover. He didn't look a fool, and if I hadn't known
the uncommon toughness of my constitution I might have been
unsettled by his forebodings.</p>

<p>I walked down to Oxford Street and had tea in a tea-shop. As I
sat among the chattering typists and shopboys I kept wondering
whether I was not wasting my time and behaving like a jackass.
Here was I, as fit as a hunter, consulting specialists and
visiting unknown masseuses in North London, and all with no clear
purpose. In less than twenty-four hours I had tumbled into a
perfectly crazy world, and for a second I had a horrid doubt
whether the craziness was not inside my mind. Had something given
in my brain last night in Medina's room, so that now I was what
people call "wanting"? I went over the sequence of events again,
and was reassured by remembering that in it all I had kept my
head. I had not got to the stage of making theories; I was still
only waiting on developments, and I couldn't see any other way
before me. I must, of course, get hold of Sandy, but first let me
see what this massage business meant. It might all be perfectly
square; I might have remembered Dr. Newhover's name by a queer
trick of memory--heard it, perhaps, from some friend--and that
remarkable practitioner might be quite honest. But then I
remembered the man's manner--I was quite clear that he knew
something of me, that someone had told him to expect me. Then it
occurred to me that I might be doing a rash thing in going off to
an unknown house in a seedy suburb. So I went into a public
telephone-booth, rang up the Club, and told the porter that if
Colonel Arbuthnot called, I was at 4 Palmyra Square, N.W.--I made
him write down the address--and would be back before ten
o'clock.</p>

<p>I was rather short of exercise, so I decided to walk, since I
had plenty of time. Strangely enough, the road was pretty much
that which I had taken on that June day of 1914 when I had been
waiting on Bullivant and the Black Stone gentry, and had walked
clean out of London to pass the time*. Then, I remembered, I had
been thrilling with wild anticipation, but now I was an older and
much wiser man, and though I was sufficiently puzzled I could
curb my restlessness with philosophy. I went up Portland Place,
past the Regent's Park, till I left the houses of the well-to-do
behind me, and got into that belt of mean streets which is the
glacis of the northern heights. Various policemen directed me,
and I enjoyed the walk as if I had been exploring, for London is
always to me an undiscovered country. I passed yards which not so
long ago had been patches of market-garden, and terraces,
sometime pretentious, and now sinking into slums; for London is
like the tropical bush--if you don't exercise constant care the
jungle, in the shape of the slums, will break in. The streets
were full of clerks and shop-girls waiting for buses, and workmen
from the St. Pancras and Clerkenwell factories going home. The
wind was rising, and in the untidy alleys was stirring up a
noisome dust; but as the ground rose it blew cleaner and seemed
to bring from Kentish fields and the Channel the tonic freshness
of spring. I stopped for a little and watched behind me the plain
of lights, which was London, quivering in the dark-blue windy
dusk.</p>

<p>[* See 'The Thirty-Nine Steps.']

<p> </p>

<p>It was almost dark when at last, after several false casts, I
came into Palmyra Square. It was a square only in name, for one
side was filled with a warehouse of sorts, and another straggled
away in nests of small brick houses. One side was a terrace of
artisans' dwellings, quite new, each with a tiny bow-window and
names like "Chatsworth" and "Kitchener Villa." The fourth side,
facing south, had once had a certain dignity, and the builder who
had designed the place seventy years ago had thought, no doubt,
that he was creating a desirable residential quarter. There the
houses stood apart, each in a patch of garden, which may at one
time have had lawns and flowers. Now these gardens were mere
dusty yards, the refuge of tin cans and bits of paper, and only a
blackened elm, an ill-grown privet hedge, and some stunted lilacs
told of the more cheerful past. On one house was the brass plate
of a doctor, on another that of a teacher of music; several
advertised lodgings to let; the steps were untidy, the gates
askew on their hinges, and over everything was written the dreary
legend of a shabby gentility on the very brink of squalor.</p>

<p>Number 4 was smarter than the others, and its front door had
been newly painted a vivid green. I rang the bell, which was an
electric one, and the door was opened by a maid who looked
sufficiently respectable. When I entered I saw that the house was
on a more generous scale than I had thought, and had once, no
doubt, been the home of some comfortable citizen. The hall was
not the tank-like thing of the small London dwelling, and the
room into which I was ushered, though small, was well furnished
and had an electric fire in the grate. It seemed to be a kind of
business room, for there was a telephone, a big safe, and on the
shelves a line of lettered boxes for papers. I began to think
that Madame Breda, whoever she might be, must be running a pretty
prosperous show on ordinary business lines.</p>

<p>I was presently led by the maid to a room on the other side of
the hall, where I was greeted by a smiling lady. Madame was a
plump person in the early forties, with dark hair and a high
colour, who spoke English almost without an accent. "Dr. Newhover
has sent you. So? He has told me. Will you please go in there and
take off your coat and waistcoat? Your collar, too, please."</p>

<p>I did as I was bid, and in a little curtained cubicle divested
myself of these garments and returned in my shirt-sleeves. The
room was a very pleasant one, with folding doors at one end,
furnished like an ordinary drawing-room, with flowers in pots and
books, and what looked like good eighteenth-century prints. Any
suspicion I may have had of the <i>bona fides</i> of the concern
received a rude shock. Madame had slipped over her black dress a
white linen overall, such as surgeons wear, and she had as her
attendant a small thin odd-looking girl, who also wore an
overall, and whose short hair was crowned with a small white
cap.</p>

<p>"This is Gerda," Madame said. "Gerda helps me. She is very
clever." She smiled on Gerda, and Gerda smiled back, a limp
little contortion of a perfectly expressionless face.</p>

<p>Madame made me lie down on a couch. "You have a headache?"</p>

<p>I mendaciously said that I had.</p>

<p>"That I can soon cure. But there are other troubles? So? These
I must explore. But first I will take away the pain."</p>

<p>"I felt her light firm fingers playing about my temples and
the base of my skull and my neck muscles. A very pleasant
sensation it was, and I am certain that if I had been suffering
from the worst headache in the world it would have been spirited
away. As it was, being in excellent health, I felt soothed and
freshened.</p>

<p>"So," she said, beaming down on me. "You are better? You are
so beeg that it is not easy to be well all over at once. Now, I
must look into more difficult things. You are not happy in your
nerves--not altogether. Ah! these nerves! We do not quite know
what they are, except that they are what you call the devil. You
are very wakeful now. Is it not so? Well I must put you to sleep.
That is necessary, if you are willing."</p>

<p>"Right-o," I answered; but inwardly I said to myself, "No, my
woman, I bet you don't." I was curious to see if, now that I was
forewarned, I could resist any hypnotic business, as I believed I
could.</p>

<p>I imagined that she would try to master me with her eyes,
which were certainly remarkable orbs. But her procedure was the
very opposite, for the small girl brought some things on a tray,
and I saw that they were bandages. First of all, with a fine
cambric handkerchief, she swathed my eyes, and then tied above it
another of some heavy opaque material. They were loosely bound,
so that I scarcely felt them, but I was left in the thickest
darkness. I noticed that she took special pains so to adjust them
that they should not cover my ears.</p>

<p>"You are not wakeful," I heard her voice say, "I think you are
sleepy. You will sleep now."</p>

<p>I felt her fingers stray over my face, and the sensation was
different, for whereas, when she had treated my headache, they
had set up a delicious cool tingling of the skin, now they seemed
to induce wave upon wave of an equally pleasant langour. She
pressed my forehead, and my senses seemed to be focused there and
to be lulled by that pressure. All the while she was cooing to me
in a voice which was like the drowsy swell of the sea. If I had
wanted to go to sleep I could have dropped off easily, but, as I
didn't want to, I had no difficulty in resisting the gentle
coercion. That, I fancy, is my position about hypnotism. I am no
kind of use under compulsion, and for the thing to affect me it
has to have the backing of my own will. Anyhow, I could
appreciate the pleasantness of it and yet disregard it. But it
was my business to be a good subject, so I pretended to drift
away into slumber. I made my breath come slowly and softly, and
let my body relax into impassivity.</p>

<p>Presently she appeared to be satisfied. She said a word to the
child, whose feet I could hear cross the room. There was a sound
of opening doors--my ears, remember, were free of the bandages
and my hearing is acute--and then it seemed to me that the couch
on which I lay began slowly to move. I had a moment of alarm and
nearly gave away the show by jerking up my head. The couch seemed
to travel very smoothly on rails, and I was conscious that I had
passed through the folding doors and was now in another room.
Then the movement stopped, and I realised that I was in an
entirely different atmosphere. I realised, too, that a new figure
had come on the scene.</p>

<p>There was no word spoken, but I had the queer inexplicable
consciousness of human presences which is independent of sight
and hearing. I have said that the atmosphere of the place had
changed. There was a scent in the air which anywhere else I would
have sworn was due to peat smoke, and mixed with it another
intangible savour which I could not put a name to, but which did
not seem to belong to London at all, or to any dwelling, but to
some wild out-of-doors. . . . And then I was aware of noiseless
fingers pressing my temples.</p>

<p>They were not the plump capable hands of Madame Breda. Nay,
they were as fine and tenuous as a wandering wind, but behind
their airy lightness was a hint of steel, as if they could choke
as well as caress. I lay supine, trying to keep my breathing
regular, since I was supposed to be asleep, but I felt an odd
excitement rising in my heart. And then it quieted for the
fingers seemed to be smoothing it away. . . . A voice was
speaking in a tongue of which I knew not a word, not speaking to
me, but repeating, as it were, a private incantation. And the
touch and voice combined to bring me nearer to losing my wits
than even on the night before, nearer than I have ever been in
all my days.</p>

<p>The experience was so novel and overpowering that I find it
hard to give even a rough impression of it. Let me put it this
way. A man at my time of life sees old age not so very far
distant, and the nearer he draws to the end of his journey the
more ardently he longs for his receding youth. I do not mean
that, if some fairy granted him the gift, he would go back to
boyhood; few of us would choose such a return; but he clothes all
his youth in a happy radiance and aches to recapture the
freshness and wonder with which he then looked on life. He
treasures, like a mooning girl, stray sounds and scents and
corners of landscape, which for a moment push the door ajar. . .
. As I lay blindfolded on that couch I felt mysterious hands and
voices plucking on my behalf at the barrier of the years and
breaking it down. I was escaping into a delectable country, the
Country of the Young, and I welcomed the escape. Had I been
hypnotised, I should beyond doubt have moved like a sheep
whithersoever this shepherd willed.</p>

<p>But I was awake, and, though on the very edge of surrender, I
managed to struggle above the tides. Perhaps to my waking self
the compulsion was too obvious and aroused a faint antagonism.
Anyhow I had already begun a conscious resistance when the
crooning voice spoke in English.</p>

<p>"You are Richard Hannay," it said. "You have been asleep, but
I have wakened you. You are happy in the world in which you have
wakened?"</p>

<p>My freedom was now complete, for I had begun to laugh,
silently, far down at the bottom of my heart. I remembered last
night, and the performance in Medina's house which had all day
been growing clearer in my memory. I saw it as farce, and this as
farce, and at the coming of humour the spell died. But it was up
to me to make some kind of an answer, if I wanted to keep up the
hoax, so I did my best to screw out an eerie sleep-walker's
voice.</p>

<p>"I am happy," I said, and my pipe sounded like the twittering
of sheeted ghosts.</p>

<p>"You wish to wake often in this world?"</p>

<p>I signified by a croak that I did.</p>

<p>"But to wake you must first sleep, and I alone can make you
sleep and wake. I exact a price, Richard Hannay. Will you pay my
price?"</p>

<p>I was puzzled about the voice. It had not the rich foreign
tones of Madame Breda, but it had a very notable accent, which I
could not place. At one moment it seemed to have the lilt which
you find in Western Ross, but there were cadences in it which
were not Highland. Also, its <i>timbre</i> was curious--very
light and thin like a child's. Was it possible that the queer
little girl I had seen was the sibyl? No, I decided; the hands
had not been a child's hands.</p>

<p>"I will pay any price," I said, which seemed to be the answer
required of me.</p>

<p>"Then you are my servant when I summon you. Now, sleep
again."</p>

<p>I had never felt less like being anyone's servant. The hands
fluttered again around my temples, but they had no more effect on
me than the buzzing of flies. I had an insane desire to laugh,
which I repressed by thinking of the idiotic pointlessness of my
recent doings. . . . I felt my couch slide backwards, and heard
the folding doors open again and close. Then I felt my bandages
being deftly undone, and I lay with the light on my closed
eyelids, trying to look like a sleeping warrior on a tomb.
Someone was pressing below my left ear and I recognised the old
hunter's method of bringing a man back gently from sleep to
consciousness, so I set about the job of making a workmanlike
awaking. I hope I succeeded. Anyhow I must have looked dazed
enough, for the lamps hurt my eyes after the muffled
darkness.</p>

<p>I was back in the first room, with only Madame beside me. She
beamed on me with the friendliest eyes, and helped me on with my
coat and collar. "I have had you under close observation," she
said, "for sleep often reveals where the ragged ends of the
nerves lie. I have made certain deductions, which I will report
to Dr. Newhover. . . . No, there is no fee. Dr. Newhover will
make arrangements." She bade me good-bye in the best professional
manner, and I descended the steps into Palmyra Square as if I had
been spending a commonplace hour having my back massaged for
lumbago.</p>

<p>Once in the open air I felt abominably tired and very hungry.
By good luck I hadn't gone far when I picked up a taxi and told
it to drive to the Club. I looked at my watch and saw that it was
later than I thought--close on ten o'clock. I had been several
hours in the house, and small wonder I was weary.</p>

<p>I found Sandy wandering restlessly about the hall. "Thank
God!" he said when he saw me. "Where the devil have you been,
Dick? The porter gave me a crazy address in North London. You
look as if you wanted a drink."</p>

<p>"I feel as if I wanted food," I said. "I have a lot to tell
you, but I must eat first. I've had no dinner."</p>

<p>Sandy sat opposite me while I fed, and forbore to ask
questions.</p>

<p>"What put you in such a bad humour last night?" I asked.</p>

<p>He looked very solemn. "Lord knows. No, that's not true, I
know well enough. I didn't take to Medina."</p>

<p>"Now I wonder why?"</p>

<p>"I wonder too. But I'm just like a dog: I take a dislike to
certain people at first sight, and the queer thing is that my
instinct isn't often wrong."</p>

<p>"Well, you're pretty well alone in your opinion. What sets you
against him? He is well-mannered, modest, a good sportsman, and
you can see he's as clever as they make."</p>

<p>"Maybe. But I've got a notion that the man is one vast lie.
However, let's put it that I reserve my opinion. I have various
inquiries to make."</p>

<p>We found the little back smoking-room on the first floor
empty, and when I had lit my pipe and got well into an armchair,
Sandy drew up another at my elbow. "Now, Dick," he said.</p>

<p>"First," I said, "it may interest you to learn that Medina
dabbles in hypnotism."</p>

<p>"I knew that," he said, "from his talk last night."</p>

<p>"How on earth--?"</p>

<p>"Oh, from a casual quotation he used. It's a longish story,
which I'll tell you later. Go on."</p>

<p>I began from the break-up of the Thursday Club dinner and told
him all I could remember of my hours in Medina's house. As a
story it met with an immense success. Sandy was so interested
that he couldn't sit in his chair, but must get up and stand on
the hearth-rug before me. I told him that I had wakened up
feeling uncommonly ill, with a blank mind except for the address
of a doctorman in Wimpole Street, and how during the day
recollection had gradually come back to me. He questioned me like
a cross-examining counsel.</p>

<p>"Bright light--ordinary hypnotic property. Face, which seemed
detached--that's a common enough thing in Indian magic. You say
you must have been asleep, but were also in a sense awake and
could hear and answer questions, and that you felt a kind of
antagonism all the time which kept your will alive. You're
probably about the toughest hypnotic proposition in the world,
Dick, and you can thank God for that. Now, what were the
questions? A summons to forget your past and begin as a new
creature, subject to the authority of a master. You assented,
making private reservations of which the hypnotist knew nothing.
If you had not kept your head and made those reservations, you
would have remembered nothing at all of last night, but there
would have been a subconscious bond over your will. As it is,
you're perfectly free: only the man who tried to monkey with you
doesn't know that. Therefore you begin by being one up on the
game. You know where you are and he doesn't know where he
is."</p>

<p>"What do you suppose Medina meant by it? It was infernal
impertinence anyhow. But was it Medina? I seem to remember
another man in the room before I left."</p>

<p>"Describe him."</p>

<p>"I've only a vague picture--a sad grey-faced fellow."</p>

<p>"Well, assume for the present that the experimenter was
Medina. There's such a thing, remember, as spiriting away a man's
recollection of his past, and starting him out as a waif in a new
world. I've heard in the East of such performances, and of course
it means that the memory-less being is at the mercy of the man
who has stolen his memory. That is probably not the intention in
your case. They wanted only to establish a subconscious control.
But it couldn't be done at once with a fellow of your
antecedents, so they organised a process. They suggested to you
in your trance a doctor's name, and the next stage was his
business. You woke feeling very seedy and remembering a doctor's
address, and they argued that you would think that you had been
advised about the fellow and make a bee-line for him. Remember,
they would assume that you had no recollection of anything else
from the night's doings. Now go ahead and tell me about the
chirurgeon. Did you go to see him?"</p>

<p>I continued my story, and at the Wimpole Street episode Sandy
laughed long and loud.</p>

<p>"Another point up in the game. You say you think the leech had
been advised of your coming and not by you? By the way, he seems
to have talked fairly good sense, but I'd as soon set a
hippopotamus for nerves as you." He wrote down Dr. Newhover's
address in his pocket book. "<i>Continuez.</i> You then
proceeded, I take it, to 4 Palmyra Square."</p>

<p>At the next stage in my narrative he did not laugh. I dare say
I told it better than I have written it down here, for I was
fresh from the experience, and I could see that he was a good
deal impressed.</p>

<p>"A Swedish masseuse and an odd-looking little girl. She puts
you to sleep, or thinks she has, and then, when your eyes are
bandaged, someone else nearly charms the soul out of you. That
sounds big magic. I see the general lines of it, but it is big
magic, and I didn't know that it was practised on these shores.
Dick, this is getting horribly interesting. You kept wide
awake--you are an old buffalo, you know--but you gave the
impression of absolute surrender. Good for you--you are now three
points ahead in the game."</p>

<p>"Well, but what is the game? I'm hopelessly puzzled."</p>

<p>"So am I, but we must work on assumptions. Let us suppose
Medina is responsible. He may only be trying to find out the
extent of his powers, and selects you as the most difficult
subject to be found. You may be sure he knows all about your
record. He may be only a vain man experimenting."</p>

<p>"In which case," I said, "I propose to punch his head."</p>

<p>"In which case, as you justly observe, you will give yourself
the pleasure of punching his head. But suppose that he has got a
far deeper purpose, something really dark and damnable. If by his
hypnotic power he could make a tool of you, consider what an
asset he would have found. A man of your ability and force. I
have always said, you remember, that you had a fine natural
talent for crime."</p>

<p>"I tell you, Sandy, that's nonsense. It's impossible that
there's anything wrong--badly wrong--with Medina."</p>

<p>"Improbable, but not impossible. We're taking no chances. And
if he were a scoundrel, think what a power he might be with all
his talents and charm and popularity."</p>

<p>Sandy flung himself into a chair and appeared to be
meditating. Once or twice he broke silence.</p>

<p>"I wonder what Dr. Newhover meant by talking of a salmon river
in Norway. Why not golf at North Berwick?"</p>

<p>And again:</p>

<p>"You say there was a scent like peat in the room? Peat! You
are certain?"</p>

<p>Finally he got up. "To-morrow," he said, "I think I will have
a look round the house in Gospel Oak. Gospel Oak, by the way, is
a funny name, isn't it? You say it has electric light. I will
visit it as a man from the corporation to see about the meter.
Oh, that can easily be managed. Macgillivray will pass the word
for me."</p>

<p>The mention of Macgillivray brought me to attention. "Look
here," I said, "I'm simply wasting my time. I got in touch with
Medina in order to ask his help, and now I've been landed in a
set of preposterous experiences which have nothing to do with my
job. I must see Macgillivray to-morrow about getting alongside
his Shropshire squire. For the present there can be nothing doing
with Medina."</p>

<p>"Shropshire squire be hanged! You're an old ass, Dick. For the
present there's everything doing with Medina. You wanted his
help. Why? Because he was the next stage in the clue to that
nonsensical rhyme. Well, you've discovered that there may be odd
things about him. You can't get his help, but you may get
something more. You may get the secret itself. Instead of having
to burrow into his memory, as you did with Greenslade, you may
find it sticking out of his life."</p>

<p>"Do you really believe that?" I asked in some
bewilderment.</p>

<p>"I believe nothing as yet. But it is far the most promising
line. He thinks that from what happened last night <i>plus</i>
what happened two hours ago you are under his influence, an
acolyte, possibly a tool. It may be all quite straight, or it may
be most damnably crooked. You have got to find out. You must keep
close to him, and foster his illusions, and play up to him for
all you're worth. He is bound to show his hand. You needn't take
any steps on your own account. He'll give you the lead all
right."</p>

<p>I can't say I liked the prospect, for I have no love for
playacting, but I am bound to admit that Sandy talked sense. I
asked him about himself, for I counted on his backing more than I
could say.</p>

<p>"I propose to resume my travels," he said. "I wish to pursue
my studies in the Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale of France."</p>

<p>"But I thought you were with me in this show."</p>

<p>"So I am. I go abroad on your business, as I shall explain to
you some day. Also I want to see the man whom we used to call Ram
Dass. I believe him to be in Munich at this moment. The day after
to-morrow you will read in <i>The Times</i> that Colonel the
Master of Clanroyden has gone abroad for an indefinite time on
private business."</p>

<p>"How long will you be away?" I groaned.</p>

<p>"A week perhaps, or a fortnight--or more. And when I come back
it may not be as Sandy Arbuthnot."</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<h1><a name="c07">CHAPTER VII</a></h1>

<h1>SOME EXPERIENCES OF A DISCIPLE</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>I didn't see Sandy again, for he took the night train for
Paris next evening, and I had to go down to Oxford that day to
appear as a witness in a running-down case. But I found a note
for me at the Club when I got back the following morning. It
contained nothing except these words: <i>"Coverts drawn blank, no
third person in house."</i> I had not really hoped for anything
from Sandy's expedition to Palmyra Square, and thought no more
about it.</p>

<p>He didn't return in a week, nor yet in a fortnight, and,
realising that I had only a little more than two months to do my
job in, I grew very impatient. But my time was pretty well filled
with Medina, as you shall hear.</p>

<p>While I was reading Sandy's note Turpin turned up, and begged
me to come for a drive in his new Delage and talk to him. The
Marquis de la Tour du Pin was, if possible, more pallid than
before, his eyelids heavier, and his gentleness more silken. He
drove me miles into the country, away through Windsor Forest, and
as we raced at sixty miles an hour he uncovered his soul. He was
going mad, it seemed; was, indeed, already mad, and only a
slender and doubtless ill-founded confidence in me prevented him
shooting himself. He was convinced that Adela Victor was dead,
and that no trace of her would ever be found. "These policemen of
yours--bah!" he moaned. "Only in England can people vanish." He
concluded, however, that he would stay alive till he had avenged
her, for he believed that a good God would some day deliver her
murderer into his hands. I was desperately sorry for him, for
behind his light gasconading manner there were marks of acute
suffering, and indeed in his case I think I should have gone
crazy. He asked me for hope, and I gave him it, and told him what
I did not believe--that I saw light in the business, and had
every confidence that we would restore him his sweetheart safe
and sound. At that he cheered up and wanted to embrace me,
thereby jolly nearly sending the Delage into a ditch and us both
into eternity. He was burning for something to do, and wanted me
to promise that as soon as possible I would inspan him into my
team. That made me feel guilty, for I knew I had no team, and
nothing you could call a clue; so I talked hastily about Miss
Victor, lest he should ask me more.</p>

<p>I had her portrait drawn for me in lyric prose. She was
slight, it seemed, middling tall, could ride like Diana and dance
like the nymphs. Her colouring and hair were those of a brunette,
but her eyes were a deep grey, and she had the soft voice which
commonly goes with such eyes. Turpin, of course, put all this
more poetically, relapsing frequently into French. He told me all
kinds of things about her--how she was crazy about dogs, and
didn't fear anything in the world, and walked with a throw-out,
and lisped delightfully when she was excited. Altogether at the
end of it I felt I had a pretty good notion of Miss Victor,
especially as I had studied about fifty photographs of her in
Macgillivray's room.</p>

<p>As we were nearing home again it occurred to me to ask him if
he knew Medina. He said no, but that he was dining at the
Victors' that evening--a small dinner party, mostly political.
"He is wonderful, that Mr. Victor. He will not change his life,
and his friends think Adela is in New York for a farewell visit.
He is like the Spartan boy with the fox."</p>

<p>"Tell Mr. Victor, with my compliments," I said, "that I would
like to dine there to-night. I have a standing invitation.
Eight-fifteen, isn't it?"</p>

<p>It turned out to be a very small and select party--the Foreign
Secretary, Medina, Palliser-Yeates, the Duke of Alcester, Lord
Sunningdale, the ex-Lord Chancellor, Levasseur the French
Minister, besides Turpin and myself. There were no women present.
The behaviour of the Duke and Mr. Victor was a lesson in
fortitude, and you would never have guessed that these two men
were living with a nightmare. It was not a talkative assembly,
though Sunningdale had a good deal to say to the table about a
new book that a German had written on the mathematical conception
of infinity, a subject which even his brilliant exposition could
not make clear to my thick wits. The Foreign Secretary and
Levasseur had a <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te,</i> with
Turpin as a hanger-on, and the rest of us would have been as dull
as sticks if it had not been for Medina. I had a good chance of
observing his quality, and I must say I was astonished at his
skill. It was he who by the right kind of question turned
Sunningdale's discourse on infinity, which would otherwise have
been a pedantic monologue, into good conversation. We got on to
politics afterwards, and Medina, who had just come from the
House, was asked what was happening.</p>

<p>"They had just finished the usual <i>plat du jour,</i> the
suspension of a couple of Labour mountebanks," he said.</p>

<p>This roused Sunningdale, who rather affected the Labour Party,
and I was amused to see how Medina handled the ex-Chancellor. He
held him in good-humoured argument, never forsaking his own
position, but shedding about the whole subject an atmosphere of
witty and tolerant understanding. I felt that he knew more about
the business than Sunningdale, that he knew so much he could
afford to give his adversary rope. Moreover, he never forgot that
he was at a dinner-table, the pitch and key of his talk were
exactly right, and he managed to bring everyone into it.</p>

<p>To me he was extraordinarily kind. Indeed he treated me like a
very ancient friend, bantering and affectionate and yet
respectful, and he forced me to take a full share in the
conversation. Under his stimulus, I became quite intelligent, and
amazed Turpin, who had never credited me with any talents except
for fighting. But I had not forgotten what I was there for, and
if I had been inclined to, there were the figures of Victor and
the Duke to remind me. I watched the two, the one thin,
grey-bearded, rather like an admiral with his vigilant dark eyes,
the other heavy-jowled, rubicund, crowned with fine silver hair;
in both I saw shadows of pain stealing back to the corners of lip
and eye, whenever the face was in repose. And Medina--the very
<i>beau ideal</i> of a courteous, kindly, open-air Englishman. I
noted how in his clothes he avoided any touch of overdressing, no
fancifully-cut waistcoat or too-smartly-tied tie. In manner and
presence he was the perfection of unselfconscious good breeding.
It was my business to play up to him, and I let my devotion be
pretty evident. The old Duke, whom I now met for the first time,
patted my shoulder as we left the dining-room. "I am glad to see
that you and Medina are friends, Sir Richard. Thank God that we
have a man like him among the young entry. They ought to give him
office at once, you know, get him inside the shafts of the coach.
Otherwise he'll find something more interesting to do than
politics."</p>

<p>By tacit consent we left the house together, and I walked the
streets by his side, as I had done three nights before. What a
change, I reflected, in my point of view! Then I had been blind,
now I was acutely watchful. He slipped an arm into mine as we
entered Pall Mall, but its pressure did not seem so much friendly
as possessive.</p>

<p>"You are staying at your Club?" he said. "Why not take up your
quarters with me while you are in town? There's ample room in
Hill Street."</p>

<p>The suggestion put me into a fright. To stay with him at
present would wreck all my schemes; but, supposing he insisted,
could I refuse, if it was my role to appear to be under his
domination? Happily he did not insist. I made a lot of
excuses--plans unsettled, constantly running down to the country,
and so on.</p>

<p>"All right. But some day I may make the offer again and then
I'll take no refusal."</p>

<p>They were just the kind of words a friend might have used, but
somehow, though the tone was all right, they slightly grated on
me.</p>

<p>"How are you?" he asked. "Most people who have led your life
find the English spring trying. You don't look quite as fit as
when I first saw you."</p>

<p>"No. I've been rather seedy this past week--headachy, loss of
memory, stuffed-up brain and that sort of thing. I expect it's
the spring fret. I've seen a doctor and he doesn't worry about
it."</p>

<p>"Who's your man?"</p>

<p>"A chap Newhover in Wimpole Street."</p>

<p>He nodded. "I've heard of him. They tell me he's good."</p>

<p>"He has ordered me massage," I said boldly. "That cures the
headaches anyway."</p>

<p>"I'm glad to hear it."</p>

<p>Then he suddenly released my arm.</p>

<p>"I see Arbuthnot has gone abroad."</p>

<p>There was a coldness in his voice to which I hastened to
respond.</p>

<p>"So I saw in the papers," I said carelessly. "He's a hopeless
fellow. A pity, for he's able enough; but he won't stay put, and
that makes him pretty well useless."</p>

<p>"Do you care much for Arbuthnot?"</p>

<p>"I used to," I replied shamelessly. "But till the other day I
hadn't seen him for years, and I must say he has grown very
queer. Didn't you think he behaved oddly at the Thursday
dinner?"</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders. "I wasn't much taken by him. He's
too infernally un-English. I don't know how he got it, but there
seems to be a touch of the shrill Levantine in him. Compare him
with those fellows to-night. Even the Frenchmen--even Victor,
though he's an American and a Jew--are more our own way of
thinking."</p>

<p>We were at the Club door, and as I stopped he looked me full
in the face.</p>

<p>"If I were you I wouldn't have much to do with Arbuthnot," he
said, and his tone was a command. I grinned sheepishly, but my
fingers itched for his ears.</p>

<p>I went to bed fuming. This new possessory attitude, this hint
of nigger-driving, had suddenly made me hate Medina. I had been
unable to set down the hypnotist business clearly to his account,
and, even if I had been certain, I was inclined to think it only
the impertinent liberty of a faddist--a thing which I hotly
resented but which did not arouse my serious dislike. But now--to
feel that he claimed me as his man, because he thought, no doubt,
that he had established some unholy power over me--that fairly
broke my temper. And his abuse of Sandy put the lid on it--abuse
to which I had been shamefully compelled to assent. Levantine, by
gad! I swore that Sandy and I would make him swallow that word
before he was very much older. I couldn't sleep for thinking
about it. By this time I was perfectly willing to believe that
Medina was up to any infamy, and I was resolved that in him and
him alone lay the key to the riddle of the three hostages. But
all the time I was miserably conscious that if I suggested such
an idea to anyone except Sandy I should be set down as a lunatic.
I could see that the man's repute was as solidly planted as the
British Constitution.</p>

<p>Next morning I went to see Macgillivray. I explained that I
had not been idle, that I had been pursuing lines of my own,
which I thought more hopeful than his suggestion of getting
alongside the Shropshire squire. I said I had nothing as yet to
report, and that I didn't propose to give him the faintest notion
of what I was after till I had secured some results. But I wanted
his help, and I wanted his very best men.</p>

<p>"Glad to see you've got busy, Dick," he said. "I await your
commands."</p>

<p>"I want a house watched. No. 4 Palmyra Square, up in North
London. So far as I know it is occupied by a woman, who purports
to be a Swedish masseuse and calls herself Madame Breda, one or
more maids, and an odd-looking little girl. I want you to have a
close record kept of the people who go there, and I want
especially to know who exactly are the inmates of the house and
who are the frequent visitors. It must be done very cautiously,
for the people must have no suspicion that they are being spied
on."</p>

<p>He wrote down the details.</p>

<p>"Also I want you to find out the antecedents of Medina's
butler."</p>

<p>He whistled. "Medina. Dominick Medina, you mean?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Oh, I'm not suspecting <i>him."</i> We both laughed, as
if at a good joke. "But I should like to hear something about his
butler, for reasons which I'm not yet prepared to give you. He
answers to the name of Odell, and has the appearance of an
inferior prize-fighter. Find out all you can about his past, and
it mightn't be a bad plan to have him shadowed. You know Medina's
house in Hill Street. But for Heaven's sake, let it be done
tactfully."</p>

<p>"I'll see to that for my own sake. I don't want head-lines in
the evening papers--'House of Member of Parliament Watched.
Another Police Muddle.'"</p>

<p>"Also, could you put together all you can get about Medina? It
might give me a line on Odell."</p>

<p>"Dick," he said solemnly, "are you growing fantastic?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it. You don't imagine I'm ass enough to think
there's anything shady about Medina. He and I have become bosom
friends and I like him enormously. Everybody swears by him, and
so do I. But I have my doubts about Mr. Odell, and I would like
to know just how and where Medina picked him up. He's not the
ordinary stamp of butler." It seemed to me very important to let
no one but Sandy into the Medina business at present, for our
chance lay in his complete confidence that all men thought well
of him.</p>

<p>"Right," said Macgillivray. "It shall be done. Go your own
way, Dick. I won't attempt to dictate to you. But remember that
the thing is desperately serious, and that the days are slipping
past. We're in April now, and you have only till midsummer to
save three innocent lives."</p>

<p>I left his office feeling very solemn, for I had suddenly a
consciousness of the shortness of time and the magnitude of the
job which I had not yet properly begun. I cudgelled my brains to
think of my next step. In a few days I should again visit Dr.
Newhover, but there was not likely to be much assistance there.
He might send me back to Palmyra Square, or I might try to make
an appointment with Madame Breda myself, inventing some new
ailment; but I would only find the same old business, which would
get me no further forward. As I viewed it, the Newhover and
Palmyra Square episodes had been used only to test my submission
to Medina's influence, and it was to Medina that I must look for
further light. It was a maddening job to sit and wait and tick
off the precious days on the calendar, and I longed to consult
with Sandy. I took to going down to Fosse for the day, for the
sight of Mary and Peter John somehow quieted my mind and fixed my
resolution. It was a positive relief when at the end of the week
Medina rang me up and asked me to luncheon.</p>

<p>We lunched at his house, which, seen on a bright April day,
was a wonderful treasury of beautiful things. It was not the kind
of house I fancied myself, being too full of museum pieces, and
all the furniture strictly correct according to period. I like
rooms in which there is a pleasant jumble of things, and which
look as if homely people had lived in them for generations. The
dining-room was panelled in white, with a Vandyck above the
mantelpiece and a set of gorgeous eighteenth-century prints on
the walls. At the excellent meal Medina as usual drank water,
while I obediently sampled an old hock, an older port, and a most
prehistoric brandy. Odell was in attendance, and I had a good
look at him--his oddly-shaped head, his flat sallow face, the
bunches of black eyebrow above his beady eyes. I calculated that
if I saw him again I would not fail to recognise him. We never
went near the library on the upper floor, but sat after luncheon
in a little smoking-room at the back of the hall, which held my
host's rods and guns in glass cabinets, and one or two fine heads
of deer and ibex.</p>

<p>I had made up my mind, as I walked to Hill Street, that I was
going to convince Medina once and for all of the abjectness of my
surrender. He should have proof that I was clay in his hands, for
only that way would he fully reveal himself. I detested the job,
and as I walked through the pleasant crisp noontide I reflected
with bitterness that I might have been fishing for salmon in
Scotland, or, better still, cantering with Mary over the Cotswold
downs.</p>

<p>All through luncheon I kept my eyes fixed on him like a dog's
on his master. Several times I wondered if I were not overdoing
it, but he seemed to accept my homage as quite natural. I had
thought when I first met him that the man had no vanity; now I
saw that he had mountains of it, that he was all vanity, and that
his public modesty was only a cloak to set off his immense
private conceit. He unbent himself, his whole mind was in
undress, and behind the veneer of good-fellowship I seemed to see
a very cold arrogant soul. Nothing worse, though that was bad
enough. He was too proud to boast in words, but his whole
attitude was one long brag. He was cynical about everything,
except, as I suspected, his private self-worship. The thing would
have been monstrously indecent, if it had not been done with such
consummate skill. Indeed I found my part easy to play, for I was
deeply impressed and had no difficulty in showing it.</p>

<p>The odd thing was that he talked a good deal about myself. He
seemed to take pains to rout out the codes and standards, the
points of honour and points of conduct, which somebody like me
was likely to revere, and to break them down with his cynicism. I
felt that I was looking on at an attempt, which the devil is
believed to specialise in, to make evil good and good evil. . . .
Of course I assented gladly. Never had master a more ready
disciple. . . . He broke down, too, my modest ambitions. A
country life, a wife and family--he showed that they were too
trivial for more than a passing thought. He flattered me grossly,
and I drank it all in with a silly face. I was fit for bigger
things, to which he would show me the way. He sketched some of
the things--very flattering they were and quite respectable, but
somehow they seemed out of the picture when compared to his
previous talk. He was clearly initiating me step by step into
something for which I was not yet fully ready. . . . I wished
Sandy could have seen me sitting in Medina's arm-chair, smoking
one of his cigars, and agreeing to everything he said like a
schoolgirl who wants to keep on the good side of her
schoolmistress. And yet I didn't find it difficult, for the man's
talk was masterly and in its way convincing, and, while my mind
repudiated it, it was easy for my tongue to assent. He was in a
prodigious good-humour, and he was kindly, as a keeper is kind to
a well-broken dog.</p>

<p>On the doorstep I stammered my thanks. "I wish I could tell
you what knowing you means to me. It's--it's far the biggest
thing in my life. What I mean to say is--" the familiar patois of
the tongue-tied British soldier.</p>

<p>He looked at me with those amazing eyes of his, no kindness in
them, only patronage and proprietorship. I think he was satisfied
that he had got someone who would serve him body and soul.</p>

<p>I, too, was satisfied, and walked away feeling more cheerful
than I had done for days. Surely things would begin to move now,
I thought. At the Club, too, I got encouragement in the shape of
a letter from Sandy. It bore a French postmark which I could not
decipher, and it was the merest scribble, but it greatly
heartened me.</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>"I have made progress," it ran, "but I have still a lot to do
and we can't talk to each other yet awhile. But I shall have to
send you letters occasionally, which you must burn on receipt. I
shall sign them with some letter of the Greek alphabet--no, you
wouldn't recognise that--with the names of recent Derby winners.
Keep our affair secret as the grave--don't let in a soul, not
even Mac. And for God's sake stick close to M. and serve him like
a slave."</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>There wasn't much in it, but it was hopeful, though the old
ruffian didn't seem in a hurry to come home. I wondered what on
earth he had found out--something solid, I judged, for he didn't
talk lightly of making progress.</p>

<p>That evening I had nothing to do, and after dinner I felt too
restless to sit down to a pipe and book. There was no one in the
Club I wanted to talk to, so I sallied forth to another pot-house
to which I belonged, where there was a chance of finding some of
the younger and cheerier generation. Sure enough the first man I
saw there was Archie Roylance, who greeted me with a whoop and
announced that he was in town for a couple of days to see his
doctor. He had had a bad fall steeplechasing earlier in the year,
when he had all but broken his neck, but he declared that he was
perfectly fit again except for some stiffness in his shoulder
muscles. He was as lame as a duck from his flying smash just
before the Armistice, but all the same he got about at a
surprising pace. Indeed, out of cussedness he walked more than he
used to do in the old days, and had taken to deer-stalking with
enthusiasm. I think I have mentioned that he was my partner in
the tenancy of Machray forest.</p>

<p>I proposed that we should go to a music-hall or cut into the
second act of some play, but Archie had another idea. One of his
fads was to be an amateur of dancing, though he had never been a
great performer before his smash and would never dance again. He
said he wanted to see the latest fashions and suggested that we
should go for an hour to a small (and he added, select) club
somewhere in Marylebone, of which he believed he was a member. It
bore an evil reputation, he said, for there was a good deal of
high play, and the licensing laws were not regarded, but it was a
place to see the best dancing. I made no objection, so we
strolled up Regent Street in that season of comparative peace
when busy people have gone home and the idle are still shut up in
theatres and restaurants.</p>

<p>It was a divine April night, and I observed that I wished I
were in a better place to enjoy spring weather. "I've just come
from a Scotch moor," said Archie. "Lord! the curlews are makin' a
joyful noise. That is the bird for my money. Come back with me,
Dick, on Friday and I'll teach you a lot of things. You're a wise
man, but you might be a better naturalist."</p>

<p>I thought how much I would have given to be able to accept, as
the light wind blew down Langham Place. Then I wished that this
job would take me out of town into fresh air, where I could get
some exercise. The result was that I was in a baddish temper when
we reached our destination, which was in one of the streets near
Fitzroy Square. The place proved to be about as hard to get into
as the Vatican. It took a long harangue and a tip from Archie to
persuade the door-keeper that we were of the right brand of
disreputability to be admitted. Finally we found ourselves in a
room with sham Chinese decorations, very garishly lit, with about
twenty couples, dancing and about twenty more sitting drinking at
little tables.</p>

<p>We paid five shillings apiece for a liqueur, found a table and
took notice of the show. It seemed to me a wholly rotten and
funereal business. A nigger band, looking like monkeys in
uniform, pounded out some kind of barbarous jingle, and sad-faced
marionettes moved to it. There was no gaiety or devil in that
dancing, only a kind of bored perfection. Thin young men with
rabbit heads and hair brushed straight back from their brows, who
I suppose were professional dancing partners, held close to their
breasts women of every shape and age, but all alike in having
dead eyes and masks for faces, and the <i>macabre</i> procession
moved like automata to the niggers' rhythm. I dare say it was all
very wonderful, but I was not built by Providence to appreciate
it.</p>

<p>"I can't stand much more of this," I told Archie.</p>

<p>"It's no great shakes. But there are one or two high-class
performers. Look at that girl dancing with the young Jew--the one
in green."</p>

<p>I looked and saw a slim girl, very young apparently, who might
have been pretty but for the way her face was loaded with paint
and the preposterous style in which her hair was dressed. Little
though I know of dancing, I could see that she was a mistress of
the art, for every motion was a delight to watch, and she made
poetry out of that hideous ragtime. But her face shocked me. It
was <i>blind,</i> if you understand me, as expressionless as a
mummy, a kind of awful death-in-life. I wondered what kind of
experience that poor soul had gone through to give her the stare
of a sleep-walker.</p>

<p>As my eyes passed from her they fell on another figure that
seemed familiar. I saw that it was Odell the butler, splendidly
got up for his night out in dress clothes, white waistcoat, and
diamond studs. There was no mistaking the pugilistic air of the
fellow, now I saw him out of service; I had seen a dozen such
behind the bars of sporting public-houses. He could not see me,
but I had a fair view of him, and I observed that he also was
watching the girl in green.</p>

<p>"Do you know who she is?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Some professional. Gad, she can dance, but the poor child
looks as if she found it a hard life. I'd rather like to talk to
her."</p>

<p>But the music had stopped, and I could see that Odell had made
a sign to the dancer. She came up to him as obediently as a dog,
he said something to another man with him, a man with a black
beard, and the three passed out at the further door. A moment
later I caught a glimpse of her with a cloak round her shoulders
passing the door by which we had entered.</p>

<p>Archie laughed. "That big brute is probably her husband. I bet
she earns the living of both by dancing at these places, and gets
beaten every night. I would say my prayers before taking on that
fellow in a scrap."</p>

<h1><a name="c08">CHAPTER VIII</a></h1>

<h1>THE BLIND SPINNER</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>I look back upon those days of waiting as among the beastliest
of my life. I had the clearest conviction now that Medina was the
key of the whole puzzle, but as yet I had found out nothing worth
mentioning, and I had to wait like the sick folk by the pool of
Bethesda till something troubled the waters. The only thing that
comforted me was the fine old-fashioned dislike to the man which
now possessed me. I couldn't pretend to understand more than a
fragment of him, but what I understood I detested. I had been
annexed by him as a slave, and every drop of free blood in my
veins was in revolt; but I was also resolved to be the most
docile slave that ever kissed the ground before a tyrant. Some
day my revenge would come and I promised myself that it would be
complete. Meantime I thanked Heaven that he had that blind spot
of vanity, which would prevent him seeing the cracks in my
camouflage.</p>

<p>For the better part of a week we were very little separate. I
lunched with him two days out of three, and we motored more than
once down to Brighton for fresh air. He took me to a dinner he
gave at the House of Commons to a Canadian statesman who was over
on a visit, and he made me accompany him to a very smart dance at
Lady Amysfort's, and he got me invited to a week-end party at
Wirlesdon because he was going there. I went through the whole
programme dutifully and not unpleasurably. I must say he treated
me admirably in the presence of other people--with a jolly
affectionate friendliness, constantly asking for my opinion, and
deferring to me and making me talk, so that the few people I met
whom I had known before wondered what had come over me. Mary had
a letter from a cousin of hers, who reported that I seemed to
have got into society and to be making a big success of it--a
letter she forwarded to me with a pencilled note of
congratulation at the end. On these occasions I didn't find my
task difficult, for I fell unconsciously under the man's spell
and could easily play up to him. . . . But when we were alone his
manner changed. Iron crept into his voice, and, though he was
pleasant enough, he took a devil of a lot for granted, and the
note of authority grew more habitual. After such occasions I used
to go home grinding my teeth. I never had a worse job than to
submit voluntarily to that insolent protection.</p>

<p>Repeatedly in my bedroom at the Club I tried to put together
the meagre handful of ascertained facts, but they were like a lot
of remnants of different jig-saw puzzles and nothing fitted in to
anything else. Macgillivray reported that so far he had drawn a
blank in the case of Odell; and that the watchers at Palmyra
Square had noted very few visitors except tradesmen and
organ-grinders. Nothing resembling a gentleman had been seen to
enter or leave, so it appeared that my estimate of Madame Breda's
flourishing business was wrong. A woman frequently went out and
returned, never walking but always in a taxi or a
motor-car--probably the same woman, but so hooded and wrapped up
as to make details difficult to be clear about. There were a host
of little notes--coal or firewood had been delivered one day,
twice the wrapped-up lady had gone out in the evening, to come
back in a couple of hours, but mostly she made her visits abroad
in daylight, the household woke late and retired to bed early,
once or twice a sound like weeping had been heard but it might
have been the cat. Altogether it was a poor report, and I
concluded that I was either barking up the wrong tree, or that
Macgillivray's agents were a pretty useless crowd.</p>

<p>For the rest, what had I? A clear and well-founded suspicion
of Medina. But of what? Only that he was behaving towards me in a
way that I resented, that he dabbled in an ugly brand of
hypnotism, and that the more I saw of him the less I liked him. I
knew that his public repute was false, but I had no worse crime
to accuse him of than vanity. He had a butler who had been a
prize-fighter, and who had a taste for night clubs. I remember I
wrote all this down, and sat staring blankly at it, feeling how
trivial it was. Then I wrote down the six-line jingle and stared
at that too, and I thought of the girl, and the young man, and
the small boy who liked birds and fishing. I hadn't a scrap of
evidence to link up Medina with that business, except that Tom
Greenslade believed that he had got from him the three facts
which ran more or less in the rhyme; but Tom might be mistaken,
or Medina might have learned them in some perfectly innocent way.
I hadn't enough evidence to swing a cat on. But yet--the more I
thought of Medina the more dark and subtle his figure loomed in
my mind. I had a conviction, on which I would have staked my
life, that if I stuck to him I would worry out some vital and
damning truth; so, with no very lively or cheerful hope, but with
complete certainty, I resolved for the hundredth time to let
logic go and back my fancy.</p>

<p>As in duty bound I paid another visit to Dr. Newhover. He
received me casually, and appeared to have forgotten about my
case till he looked up his diary.</p>

<p>"Ah yes, you saw Madame Breda," he said. "I have her report.
Your headaches are cured but you are still a little shaky? Yes,
please. Take off your coat and waistcoat."</p>

<p>He vetted me very thoroughly, and then sat down in his
desk-chair and tapped his eye-glasses on his knee.</p>

<p>"You are better, much better, but you are not cured. That will
take time and care, and lies, of course, in your own hands. You
are leading a quiet life? Half town, half country--it is probably
the best plan. Well, I don't think you can improve on that."</p>

<p>"You said something about fishing in Norway when I was here
last."</p>

<p>"No, on the whole I don't recommend it. Your case is slightly
different from what I at first supposed."</p>

<p>"You are a fisherman yourself?" I said.</p>

<p>He admitted that he was, and for a minute or two spoke more
like a human being. He always used a two-piece Castle-Connell
rod, though he granted it was a cumbrous thing to travel with.
For flies he swore by Harlows--certainly the best people for
Norwegian flies. He thought that there was a greater difference
between Norwegian rivers than most people imagined, and Harlows
understood that.</p>

<p>He concluded by giving me some simple instructions about diet
and exercise.</p>

<p>"If my headaches return, shall I go back to Madame Breda?" I
asked.</p>

<p>He shook his head. "Your headaches won't return."</p>

<p>I paid him his fee, and, as I was leaving, I asked if he
wanted to see me again.</p>

<p>"I don't think it necessary. At any rate not till the autumn.
I may have to be out of London myself a good deal this summer. Of
course if you should find the <i>malaise</i> recurring, which I
do not anticipate, you must come and see me. If I am out of town,
you can see my colleague." He scribbled a name and address on a
sheet of paper.</p>

<p>I left the house feeling considerably puzzled. Dr. Newhover,
who on my first visit had made a great to-do about my health,
seemed now to want to be quit of me. His manner was exactly that
of a busy doctor dealing with a <i>malade imaginaire.</i> The odd
thing was that I was really beginning to feel rather seedy, a
punishment for my former pretence. It may have been the reaction
of my mental worry, but I had the sort of indefinite out-of-sorts
feeling which I believe precedes an attack of influenza. Only I
had hitherto been immune from influenza.</p>

<p>That night I had another of Sandy's communications, a typed
half-sheet with a Paris postmark.</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Keep close to M.," it ran. "Do everything he wants. Make it
clear that you have broken for ever with me. This is desperately
important."</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>It was signed "Buchan," a horse which Sandy seemed to think
had been a Derby winner. He knew no more about racing than I knew
of Chinese.</p>

<p>Next morning I woke with a bad taste in my mouth and a feeling
that I had probably a bout of malaria due me. Now I had had no
malaria since the autumn of '17, and I didn't like the prospect
of the revisitation. However, as the day wore on, I felt better,
and by midday I concluded I was not going to be ill. But all the
same I was as jumpy as a cat in a thunderstorm. I had the odd
sense of anticipation, which I used to have before a battle, a
lurking excitement by no means pleasant--not exactly
apprehension, but first cousin to it. It made me want to see
Medina, as if there was something between him and me that I ought
to get over.</p>

<p>All afternoon this dentist-anteroom atmosphere hung about me,
and I was almost relieved when about five o'clock I got a
telephone message from Hill Street asking me to come there at
six. I went round to the Bath Club and had a swim and a shampoo,
and then started for the house. On the way there I had those
tremors in my legs and coldness in the pit of the stomach which
brought back my childish toothaches. Yes, that was it. I felt
exactly like a small boy setting off with dreadful anticipations
to have a tooth drawn, and not all my self-contempt could cure me
of my funk. The house when I reached it seemed larger and
lonelier than ever, and the April evening had darkened down to a
scurry of chill dusty winds under a sky full of cloud.</p>

<p>Odell opened the door to me, and took me to the back of the
hall, where I found a lift which I had not known existed. We went
up to the top of the house, and I realised that I was about to
enter again the library where before I had so strangely spent the
midnight hours.</p>

<p>The curtains were drawn, shutting out the bleak spring
twilight, and the room was warmed by, and had for its only light,
a great fire of logs. I smelt more than wood smoke; there was
peat burning among the oak billets. The scent recalled, not the
hundred times when I had sniffed peat-reek in happy places, but
the flavour of the room in Palmyra Square when I had lain with
bandaged eyes and felt light fingers touch my face. I had
suddenly a sense that I had taken a long stride forward, that
something fateful was about to happen, and my nervousness dropped
from me like a cloak.</p>

<p>Medina was standing before the hearth, but his was not the
figure that took my eyes. There was another person in the room, a
woman. She sat in the high-backed chair which he had used on the
former night, and she sat in it as if it were a throne. The
firelight lit her face, and I saw that it was very old, waxen
with age, though the glow made the wax rosy. Her dress was
straight and black like a gaberdine, and she had thick folds of
lace at her wrists and neck. Wonderful hair, masses of it, was
piled on her head, and it was snow-white and fine as silk. Her
hands were laid on the arms of the chair, and hands more delicate
and shapely I have never seen, though they had also the
suggestion of a furious power, like the talons of a bird of
prey.</p>

<p>But it was the face that took away my breath. I have always
been a great admirer of the beauty of old age, especially in
women, but this was a beauty of which I had never dreamed. It was
a long face, and the features were large, though exquisitely cut
and perfectly proportioned. Usually in an old face there is a
certain loosening of muscles or blurring of contours, which
detracts from sheer beauty but gives another kind of charm. But
in this face there was no blurring or loosening; the mouth was as
firm, the curve of the chin as rounded, the arch of the eyes as
triumphant as in some proud young girl.</p>

<p>And then I saw that the eyes which were looking at the fire
were the most remarkable things of all. Even in that half-light I
could see that they were brightly, vividly blue. There was no
film or blearing to mar their glory. But I saw also that they
were sightless. How I knew it I do not know, for there was no
physical sign of it, but my conviction was instantaneous and
complete. These starlike things were turned inward. In most blind
people the eyes are like marbles, dead windows in an empty house;
but--how shall I describe it?--these were blinds drawn in a room
which was full of light and movement, stage curtains behind which
some great drama was always set. Blind though they were, they
seemed to radiate an ardent vitality, to glow and flash like the
soul within.</p>

<p>I realised that it was the most wonderful face of a woman I
had ever looked on. And I realised in the same moment that I
hated it, that the beauty of it was devilish, and the soul within
was on fire with all the hatred of Hell.</p>

<p>"Hannay," I heard Medina's voice, "I have brought you here
because I wish to present you to my mother."</p>

<p>I behaved just like somebody in a play. I advanced to her
chair, lifted one of the hands, and put it to my lips. That
seemed to me the right thing to do. The face turned towards me,
and broke into a smile, the kind of smile you may see on the
marble of a Greek goddess.</p>

<p>The woman spoke to Medina in a tongue which was strange to me,
and he replied. There seemed to be many questions and answers,
but I did not trouble to try to catch a word I knew. I was
occupied with the voice. I recognised in it those soft tones
which had crooned over me as I lay in the room in Palmyra Square.
I had discovered who had been the third person in that scene.</p>

<p>Then it spoke to me in English, with that odd lilting accent I
had tried in vain to trace.</p>

<p>"You are a friend of Dominick, and I am glad to meet you, Sir
Richard Hannay. My son has told me about you. Will you bring a
chair and sit close to me?"</p>

<p>I pulled up a long low arm-chair, so long and low that the
sitter was compelled almost to recline. My head was on a level
with the hand which lay on the arm of her chair. Suddenly I felt
that hand laid on my head, and I recognised her now by touch as
well as voice.</p>

<p>"I am blind, Sir Richard," she said, "so I cannot see my son's
friends. But I long to know how they look, and I have but one
sense which can instruct me. Will you permit me to pass my hands
over your face?"</p>

<p>"You may do what you please, Madame," I said. "I would to God
I could give you eyes."</p>

<p>"That is a pretty speech," she said. "You might be one of my
own people." And I felt the light fingers straying over my
brow.</p>

<p>I was so placed that I was looking into the red heart of the
fire, the one patch of bright light in the curtained room. I knew
what I was in for, and, remembering past experience, I averted my
eyes to the dark folios on the lowest shelves beyond the hearth.
The fingers seemed to play a gentle tattoo on my temples, and
then drew long soft strokes across my eyebrows. I felt a pleasant
languor beginning to creep down my neck and spine, but I was
fully prepared, and without much trouble resisted it. Indeed my
mind was briskly busy, for I was planning how best to play my
game. I let my head recline more and more upon the cushioned back
of my chair, and I let my eyelids droop.</p>

<p>The gentle fingers were very thorough, and I had let myself
sink back beyond their reach before they ceased.</p>

<p>"You are asleep," the voice said. "Now wake."</p>

<p>I was puzzled to know how to stage-manage that wakening, but
she saved me the trouble. Her voice suddenly hissed like a
snake's. "Stand up!" it said. "Quick--on your life."</p>

<p>I scrambled to my feet with extreme energy, and stood staring
at the fire, wondering what to do next.</p>

<p>"Look at your master," came the voice again, peremptory as a
drill-sergeant's.</p>

<p>That gave me my cue. I knew where Medina was standing, and, in
the words of the Bible, my eyes regarded him as a handmaiden
regards her master. I stood before him, dumb and dazed and
obedient.</p>

<p>"Down," he cried. "Down, on all-fours."</p>

<p>I did as I was bid, thankful that my job was proving so
easy.</p>

<p>"Go to the door--no, on all-fours, open it twice, shut it
twice, and bring me the paper-knife from the far table in your
mouth."</p>

<p>I obeyed, and a queer sight I must have presented prancing
across the room, a perfectly sane man behaving like a
lunatic.</p>

<p>I brought the paper-knife, and remained dog-wise. "Get up," he
said, and I got up.</p>

<p>I heard the woman's voice say triumphantly: "He is well
broken," and Medina laughed.</p>

<p>"There is yet the last test," he said. "I may as well put him
through it now. If it fails, it means only that he needs more
schooling. He cannot remember, for his mind is now in my keeping.
There is no danger."</p>

<p>He walked up to me, and gave me a smart slap in the face.</p>

<p>I accepted it with Christian meekness. I wasn't even angry. In
fact I would have turned the other cheek in the Scriptural
fashion, if it hadn't occurred to me that it might be
overacting.</p>

<p>Then he spat in my face.</p>

<p>That, I admit, tried me pretty high. It was such a filthy
Kaffir trick that I had some trouble in taking it resignedly. But
I managed it. I kept my eyes on the ground, and didn't even get
out my handkerchief to wipe my cheek till he had turned away.</p>

<p>"Well broken to heel," I heard him say. "It is strange how
easily these flat tough English natures succumb to the stronger
spirit. I have got a useful weapon in him, mother mine."</p>

<p>They paid no more attention to me than if I had been a piece
of furniture, which, indeed, in their eyes I was. I was asleep,
or rather awake in a phantasmal world, and I could not return to
my normal life till they bade me. I could know nothing--so they
thought--and remember nothing, except what they willed. Medina
sat in my chair, and the woman had her hand on his head, and they
talked as if they were alone in the desert. And all the while I
was standing sheepishly on the rug, not daring to move, scarcely
to breathe, lest I should give the show away.</p>

<p>They made a pretty picture--"The Prodigal's Return" or "The
Old Folks at Hone," by Simpkins, R.A., Royal Academy, 1887. No,
by Heaven, there was no suggestion of that. It was a marvellous
and tragic scene that I regarded. The fitful light of the fire
showed figures of an antique beauty and dignity. The regal
profile of the woman, her superb pose, and the soft eerie music
of her voice were a world removed from vulgarity, and so was the
lithe vigour and the proud face of the man. They were more like a
king and queen in exile, decreeing the sea of blood which was to
wash them back again. I realised for the first time that Medina
might be damnable, but was also great. Yes, the man who had spat
on me like a stable-boy had also something of the prince. I
realised another thing. The woman's touch had flattened down the
hair above his forehead, which he brushed square, and his head,
outlined in the firelight against the white cushion, was as round
as a football. I had suspected this when I first saw him, and now
I was certain. What did a head like that portend? I had a vague
remembrance that I had heard somewhere that it meant madness--at
any rate degeneracy.</p>

<p>They talked rapidly and unceasingly, but the confounded thing
was that I could hear very little of it. They spoke in low tones,
and I was three yards off and daren't for my life move an inch
nearer. Also they spoke for the most part in a language of which
I did not know a word--it may have been Choctaw, but was probably
Erse. If I had only comprehended that tongue I might there and
then have learned all I wanted to know. But sometimes Medina
talked English, though it seemed to me that the woman always
tried to bring him back to the other speech. All I heard were
broken sentences that horribly tantalised me.</p>

<p>My brain was cool and very busy. This woman was the Blind
Spinner of the rhymes. No doubt of it. I could see her spinning
beside a peat fire, nursing ancient hate and madness, and
crooning forgotten poetry. <i>"Beside the Sacred Tree."</i>
Yggdrasil be hanged! I had it, it was Gospel Oak. Lord, what a
fool I had been not to guess it before! The satisfaction of
having got one of the three conundrums dead right made me want to
shout. These two harpies held the key to the whole riddle, and I
had only to keep up my present character to solve it. They
thought they were dealing with a hypnotised fool, and instead
they had a peculiarly wide-awake if rather slow and elderly
Englishman. I wished to Heaven I knew what they were saying.
Sluicing out malice about my country, no doubt, or planning the
ruin of our civilisation for the sake of a neurotic dream.</p>

<p>Medina said something impatiently about "danger," as if his
purpose were to reassure. Then I caught nothing for several
minutes, till he laughed and repeated the word "<i>secundus</i>."
Now I was looking for three people, and if there was a
"<i>secundus</i>" there must have been a "<i>primus</i>," and
possibly a "<i>tertius</i>."</p>

<p>"He is the least easy to handle," he said. "And it is quite
necessary that Jason should come home. I have decided that the
doctor must go out. It won't be for long--only till
midsummer."</p>

<p>The date interested me acutely. So did what followed, for he
went on:</p>

<p>"By midsummer they liquidate and disband. There is no fear
that it won't succeed. We have the whip hand, remember. Trust me,
all will go smoothly, and then we begin a new life. . . ."</p>

<p>I thought she sighed, and for the first time she spoke in
English:</p>

<p>"I fear sometimes that you are forgetting your own land,
Dominick."</p>

<p>He put up an arm and drew her head to his.</p>

<p>"Never, mother mine. It is our strength that we can seem to
forget and still remember."</p>

<p>I was finding my stand on that hearth-rug extraordinarily
trying. You see I had to keep perfectly rigid, for every now and
then Medina would look towards me, and I knew that the woman had
an ear like a hound. But my knees were beginning to shake with
fatigue and my head to grow giddy, and I feared that, like the
soldiers who stand guard round a royal bier, I might suddenly
collapse. I did my best to struggle against the growing weakness,
and hoped to forget it by concentrating all my attention on the
fragments of talk.</p>

<p>"I have news for you," Medina was saying. "Khar&aacute;ma is
in Europe and proposes to come to England."</p>

<p>"You will see him?" I thought her voice had a trace of alarm
in it.</p>

<p>"Most certainly. I would rather see him than any living
man."</p>

<p>"Dominick, be careful. I would rather you confined yourself to
your old knowledge. I fear these new things from the East."</p>

<p>He laughed. "They are as old as ours--older. And all knowledge
is one. I have already drunk of his learning and I must have the
whole cup."</p>

<p>That was the last I heard, for at that moment I made my exit
from the scene in a way which I could not have bettered by much
cogitation. My legs suddenly gave under me, the room swam round,
and I collapsed on the floor in a dead faint. I must have fallen
heavily, for I knocked a leg off one of the little tables.</p>

<p>When I came to--which I suppose was a minute or two
later--Odell was bathing my face, and Medina with a grave and
concerned air was standing by with a brandy decanter.</p>

<p>"My dear fellow, you gave me a bad fright," he said, and his
manner was that of the considerate friend. "You're not feeling
ill?"</p>

<p>"I haven't been quite fit all day, and I suppose the hot room
knocked me out. I say, I'm most awfully sorry for playing the
fool like this. I've damaged your furniture, I'm afraid. I hope I
didn't scare the lady."</p>

<p>"What lady?"</p>

<p>"Your mother."</p>

<p>He looked at me with a perfectly blank face, and I saw I had
made a mistake.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon--I'm still giddy. I've been dreaming."</p>

<p>He gave me a glass of brandy and tucked me into a taxi. Long
before I got to the Club I was feeling all right, but my mind was
in a fine turmoil. I had stumbled at last upon not one clue but
many, and though they were confused enough, I hoped with luck to
follow them out. I could hardly eat any dinner that night, and my
brain was too unsettled to do any serious thinking. So I took a
taxi up to Gospel Oak, and, bidding it wait for me, had another
look at Palmyra Square. The place seemed to have been dead and
decaying for centuries, seen in that windy moonless dark, and No.
4 was a shuttered tomb. I opened the gate and, after making sure
that the coast was clear, stole round to the back-door where
tradesmen called. There were some dilapidated outhouses, and the
back garden, with rank grasses and obscene clothes-posts, looked
like nothing so much as a neglected grave-yard. In that house was
the terrible blind Fate that span. As I listened I heard from
somewhere inside the sound of slow heartbroken sobs. I wondered
if they came from the queer-looking little girl.</p>

<h1><a name="c09">CHAPTER IX</a></h1>

<h1>I AM INTRODUCED TO STRONG MAGIC</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>The first thing I did when I got up next morning was to pay a
visit to Harlows, the fishing-tackle people. They knew me well
enough, for I used to buy my rods there, and one of the
assistants had been down to Fosse to teach Mary how to use a
light split-cane. With him I embarked on a long talk about
Norwegian rivers and their peculiarities, and very soon got his
views on the best flies. I asked which river was considered to be
the earliest, and was told in an ordinary season the Nirdal and
the Skarso. Then I asked if he knew my friend Dr. Newhover. "He
was in here yesterday afternoon," I was told. "He is going to the
Skarso this year, and hopes to be on the water in the last week
of April. Rather too soon in my opinion, though salmon have been
caught in it as early as April 17th. By the end of the first week
of May it should be all right." I asked a good deal more about
the Skarso, and was told that it was best fished from Merdal at
the head of the Merdalfjord. There were only about three miles of
fishable water before the big foss, but every yard of it was
good. I told him I had hoped to get a beat on the Leardal for
June, but had had to give up the notion this year and intended to
confine myself to Scotland. I bought a new reel, a quantity of
sea-trout flies, and a little book about Norwegian fishing.</p>

<p>Then I went on to see Macgillivray, with whom I had made an
appointment by telephone.</p>

<p>"I've come to ask your help," I told him. "I'm beginning to
get a move on, but it's a ticklish business, and I must walk very
warily. First of all, I want you to find out the movements of a
certain Dr. Newhover of Wimpole Street. He is going to Norway
some time in the next fortnight, to the Skarso to fish, and his
jumping-off place will be Stavanger. Find out by which boat he
takes a passage, and book me a berth in it also. I'd better have
my old name, Cornelius Brand."</p>

<p>"You're not thinking of leaving England just now?" he asked
reproachfully.</p>

<p>"I don't know. I may have to go or I may not, but in any case
I won't be long away. Anyhow, find out about Dr. Newhover. Now
for the more serious business. Just about when have you settled
to round up the gang?"</p>

<p>"For the reasons I gave you it must be before midsummer. It is
an infernally complicated job and we must work to a time-table. I
had fixed provisionally the 20th of June."</p>

<p>"I think you'd better choose an earlier date."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because the gang are planning themselves to liquidate by
midsummer, and, if you don't hurry, you may draw the net tight
and find nothing in it."</p>

<p>"Now how on earth did you find that out?" he asked, and his
usually impassive face was vivid with excitement.</p>

<p>"I can't tell you. I found it out in the process of hunting
for the hostages, and I give you my word it's correct."</p>

<p>"But you must tell me more. If you have fresh lines on what
you call my 'gang,' it may be desperately important for me to
know."</p>

<p>"I haven't. I've just the one fact, which I have given you.
Honestly, old man, I can't tell you anything more till I tell you
everything. Believe me, I'm working hard."</p>

<p>I had thought the thing out, and had resolved to keep the
Medina business to myself and Sandy. Our one chance with him was
that he should be utterly unsuspecting, and even so wary a fellow
as Macgillivray might, if he were told, create just that faint
breath of suspicion that would ruin all. He grunted, as if he
were not satisfied. "I suppose you must have it your own way.
Very well, we'll fix the 10th of June for <i>Der Tag.</i> You
realise, of course, that the round-up of all must be
simultaneous--that's why it takes such a lot of <i>bandobast.</i>
By the way, you've got the same problem with the hostages. You
can't release one without the others, or the show is given
away--not your show only but mine. You realise that?"</p>

<p>"I do," I said, "and I realise that the moving forward of your
date narrows my time down to less than two months. If I succeed,
I must wait till the very eve of your move. Not earlier, I
suppose, than June 9th? Assume I only find one of the three? I
wait till June 9th before getting him out of their clutches. Then
you strike, and what happens to the other two?"</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders. "The worst, I fear. You see, Dick,
the gang I mean to crush and the people who hold the hostages are
allied, but I take it they are different sets. I may land every
member of my gang, and yet not come within speaking distance of
the other lot. I don't know, but I'm pretty certain that even if
we found the second lot we'd never be able to prove complicity
between the two. The first are devilish deep fellows, but the
second are great artists."</p>

<p>"All the same," I said, "I'm in hopes of finding at least one
of the hostages, and that means some knowledge of the
kidnappers."</p>

<p>"I must not ask, but I'd give my head to know how and where
you're working. More power to you! But I wonder if you'll ever
get near the real prime fountain of iniquity."</p>

<p>"I wonder," I said, and took my leave.</p>

<p>I had been playing with sickness, and now it looked as if I
was going to be punished by getting the real thing. For all the
rest of that day I felt cheap, and in the evening I was positive
I had a temperature. I thought I might have 'flu, so I went round
after dinner to see a doctor whom I had known in France. He
refused to admit the temperature. "What sort of life have you
been leading these last weeks?" he asked, and when I told him
that I had been hanging round London waiting on some tiresome
business developments, he said that that was the whole trouble.
"You're accustomed to an active life in fresh air and you've been
stuffing in town, feeding too well and getting no exercise. Go
home to-morrow and you'll be as right as a trivet."</p>

<p>"It rather would suit me to be sick for a spell--say a
week."</p>

<p>He looked puzzled and then laughed.</p>

<p>"Oh, if you like I'll give you a chit to say you must go back
to the country at once or I won't answer for the
consequences."</p>

<p>"I'd like that, but not just yet. I'll ring you up when I want
it. Meantime I can take it that there's nothing wrong with
me?"</p>

<p>"Nothing that a game of squash and a little Eno won't
cure."</p>

<p>"Well, when you send me that chit, say I've got to have a
quiet week in bed at home--no visitors--regular rest cure."</p>

<p>"Right," he said. "It's a prescription that every son of Adam
might follow with advantage four times a year."</p>

<p>When I got back to the Club I found Medina waiting for me. It
was the first time he had visited me there, and I pretended to be
delighted to see him--almost embarrassed with delight--and took
him to the back smoking-room where I had talked with Sandy. I
told him that I was out of sorts, and he was very sympathetic.
Then, with a recollection of Sandy's last letter, I started out
to blaspheme my gods. He commented on the snugness and seclusion
of the little room, which for the moment we had to ourselves.</p>

<p>"It wasn't very peaceful when I was last in it," I said. "I
had a row here with that lunatic Arbuthnot before he went
abroad."</p>

<p>He looked up at the name.</p>

<p>"You mean you quarrelled. I thought you were old friends."</p>

<p>"Once we were. Now I never want to see the fellow again." I
thought I might as well do the job thoroughly, though the words
stuck in my throat.</p>

<p>I thought he seemed pleased.</p>

<p>"I told you," he said, "that he didn't attract me."</p>

<p>"Attract!" I cried. "The man has gone entirely to the devil.
He has forgotten his manners, his breeding, and everything he
once possessed. He has lived so long among cringing Orientals
that his head is swollen like a pumpkin. He wanted to dictate to
me, and I said I would see him further--and--oh well, we had the
usual row. He's gone back to the East, which is the only place
for him, and--no! I never want to clap eyes on him again."</p>

<p>There was a purr of satisfaction in his voice, for he
believed, as I meant him to, that his influence over me had been
strong enough to shatter an ancient friendship. "I am sure you
are wise. I have lived in the East and know something of its
ways. There is the road of knowledge and the road of illusion,
and Arbuthnot has chosen the second. . . . We are friends,
Hannay, and I have much to tell you some day--perhaps very soon.
I have made a position for myself in the world, but the figure
which the world sees is only a little part of me. The only power
is knowledge, and I have attained to a knowledge compared with
which Arbuthnot's is the merest smattering."</p>

<p>I noticed that he had dropped the easy, well-bred, deprecating
manner which I had first noted in him. He spoke to me now
magisterially, arrogantly, almost pompously.</p>

<p>"There has never been a true marriage of East and West," he
went on. "To-day we incline to put a false interpretation on the
word Power. We think of it in material terms like money, or the
control of great patches of inanimate nature. But it still means,
as it has always meant, the control of human souls, and to him
who acquires that everything else is added. How does such control
arise? Partly by knowledge of the intricacies of men's hearts,
which is a very different thing from the stock platitudes of the
professional psychologists. Partly by that natural dominion of
spirit which comes from the possession of certain human qualities
in a higher degree than other men. The East has the secret
knowledge, but, though it can lay down the practice, it cannot
provide the practitioners. The West has the tools, but not the
science of their use. There has never, as I have said, been a
true marriage of East and West, but when there is, its seed will
rule the world."</p>

<p>I was drinking this in with both ears, and murmuring my
assent. Now at last I was to be given his confidence, and I
prayed that he might be inspired to go on. But he seemed to
hesitate, till a glance at my respectful face reassured him. "The
day after to-morrow a man will be in London, a man from the East,
who is a great master of this knowledge. I shall see him, and you
will accompany me. You will understand little, for you are only
at the beginning, but you will be in the presence of wisdom."</p>

<p>I murmured that I should feel honoured.</p>

<p>"You will hold yourself free for all that day. The time will
probably be the evening."</p>

<p>After that he left with the most perfunctory good-bye. I
congratulated myself on having attained to just the kind of
position I wanted--that of a disciple whose subjection was so
much taken for granted that he was treated like a piece of
furniture. From his own point of view Medina was justified; he
must have thought the subconscious control so strong, after all
the tests I had been through, that my soul was like putty in his
hands.</p>

<p>Next day I went down to Fosse and told Mary to expect me back
very soon for a day or two. She had never plagued me with
questions, but something in my face must have told her that I was
hunting a trail, for she asked me for news and looked as if she
meant to have it. I admitted that I had found out something, and
said I would tell her everything when I next came back. That
would only have been prudent, for Mary was a genius at keeping
secrets and I wanted some repository of my knowledge in case I
got knocked on the head.</p>

<p>When I returned to town I found another note from Sandy, also
from France, signed "Alan Breck"--Sandy was terribly out with his
Derby winners. It was simply two lines imploring me again to make
Medina believe I had broken with him and that he had gone east of
Suez for good.</p>

<p>There was also a line from Macgillivray, saying that Dr.
Newhover had taken a passage on the <i>Gudrun,</i> leaving Hull
at 6.30 p.m. on the 21st, and that a passage had been booked for
C. Brand, Esqre, by the same boat. That decided me, so I wrote to
my own doctor asking for the chit he had promised, to be dated
the 19th. I was busy with a plan, for it seemed to me that it was
my duty to follow up the one trail that presented itself, though
it meant letting the rest of the business sleep. I longed more
than I could say for a talk with Sandy, who was now playing the
fool in France and sending me imbecile notes. I also rang up
Archie Roylance, and found to my delight that he had not left
town, for I ran him to ground at the Travellers', and fixed a
meeting for next morning.</p>

<p>"Archie," I said, when we met, "I want to ask a great favour
from you. Are you doing anything special in the next
fortnight?"</p>

<p>He admitted that he had thought of getting back to Scotland to
watch a pair of nesting greenshanks.</p>

<p>"Let the greenshanks alone, like a good fellow. I've probably
got to go to Norway on the 21st, and I shall want to get home in
the deuce of a hurry. The steamer's far too slow."</p>

<p>"Destroyer," he suggested.</p>

<p>"Hang it, this is not the War. Talk sense. I want an
aeroplane, and I want you to fetch me."</p>

<p>Archie whistled long and loud.</p>

<p>"You're a surprisin' old bird, Dick. It's no joke bein' a pal
of yours. . . . I dare say I could raise a bus all right. But
you've got to chance the weather. And my recollection of Norway
is that it's not very well provided with landin' places. What
part do you favour?"</p>

<p>I told him the mouth of the Merdalfjord.</p>

<p>"Lord! I've been there," he said. "It's all as steep as the
side of a house."</p>

<p>"Yes, but I've been studying the map, and there are some
eligible little islands off the mouth, which look flattish from
the contouring. I'm desperately serious, old man. I'm engaged on
a job where failure means the loss of innocent lives. I'll tell
you all about it soon, but meantime you must take my word for
it."</p>

<p>I managed to get Archie suitably impressed, and even to
interest him in the adventure, for he was never the man to lag
behind in anything that included risk and wanted daring. He
promised to see Hansen, who had been in his squadron and was
believed to have flown many times across the North Sea. As I left
him I could see that he was really enormously cheered by the
prospect, for if he couldn't watch his blessed birds the next
best thing was to have a chance of breaking his neck.</p>

<p>I had expected to be bidden by Medina to meet his necromancer
in some den in the East End or some Bloomsbury lodging-house.
Judge of my surprise, then, when I was summoned to Claridge's for
nine-thirty that evening. When I got to the hotel it was
difficult to believe that a place so bright and commonplace could
hold any mystery. There was the usual dancing going on, and
squads of people who had dined well were sitting around watching.
Medina was standing by a fireplace talking to a man who wore a
long row of miniature medals and a star, and whom I recognised as
Tom Machin, who had commanded a cavalry brigade in France. Medina
nodded casually to me, and Tom, whom I had not seen for years,
made a great fuss.</p>

<p>"Regimental dinner," he explained. "Came out for a moment to
give instructions about my car. Been telling Medina here of the
dirty trick the Government have played on my old crowd. I say
it's up to the few sahibs like him in that damned monkey-house at
Westminster to make a row about it. You back me up, Hannay. What
I say is . . ." and so on with all the eternal iteration of
"abso-lutely" and "If you follow me" and "You see what I mean" of
the incoherent British regular.</p>

<p>Medina gently disengaged himself. "Sorry, Tom, but I must be
off now. You're dining with Burminster on Thursday aren't you?
We'll talk about that business then. I agree it's an infernal
shame."</p>

<p>He signed to me and we went together to the lift. On the first
floor, where the main suites are, a turbaned Indian waited for us
in the corridor. He led us into a little ante-room, and then
disappeared through big folding-doors. I wondered what kind of
swell this Oriental necromancer must be who could take rooms like
these, for the last time I had been in them was when they were
occupied by a Crown Prince who wanted to talk to me about a
certain little problem in Anatolia.</p>

<p>"You are about to see Khar&aacute;ma," Medina whispered, and
there was an odd exaltation in his voice. "You do not know his
name, but there are millions in the East who reverence it like
that of a god. I last saw him in a hut on the wildest pass in the
Karakoram, and now he is in this gilded hotel with the
dance-music of the West jigging below. It is a parable of the
unity of all Power."</p>

<p>The door was opened, and the servant beckoned us to enter. It
was a large room furnished with the usual indifferent copies of
French furniture--very hot and scented, just the kind of place
where international financiers make their deals over liqueur
brandy and big cigars, or itinerant stars of the cinema world
receive their friends. Bright, hard and glossy, you would have
said that no vulgarer environment could be found. . . . And yet
after the first glance I did not feel its commonness, for it was
filled with the personality of the man who sat on a couch at the
far end. I realised that here was one who carried with him his
own prepotent atmosphere, and who could transform his
surroundings, whether it was a Pamir hut or a London
restaurant.</p>

<p>To my surprise he was quite young. His hair was hidden by a
great turban, but the face was smooth and hairless, and the
figure, so far as I could judge, had not lost the grace of youth.
I had imagined someone immensely venerable and old with a beard
to his girdle, or, alternately, an obese babu with a soft face
like a eunuch. I had forgotten that this man was of the hills. To
my amazement he wore ordinary evening dress, well-cut too, I
thought, and over it a fine silk dressing-gown. He had his feet
tucked up on the couch, but he did not sit cross-legged. At our
entrance he slightly inclined his head, while we both bowed.
Medina addressed him in some Indian tongue, and he replied, and
his voice was like the purr of a big cat.</p>

<p>He motioned us to sit down, looking not so much at us as
through us, and while Medina spoke I kept my eyes on his face. It
was the thin, high-boned, high-bred face of the hillman; not the
Mongolian type, but that other which is like an Arab, the kind of
thing you can see in Pathan troops. And yet, though it was as
hard as flint and as fierce as Satan, there was a horrid feline
softness in it, like that of a man who would never need to strike
a blow in anger, since he could win his way otherwise. The brow
was straight and heavy, such as I had always associated with
mathematical talent, and broader than is common with Orientals.
The eyes I could not see, for he kept them half shut, but there
was something uncanny in the way they were chased in his head,
with an odd slant the opposite from what you see in the Chinaman.
His mouth had a lift at each corner as if he were perpetually
sneering, and yet there was a hint of humour in the face, though
it was as grave as a stone statue.</p>

<p>I have rarely seen a human being at once so handsome and so
repulsive, but both beauty and horror were merged in the
impression of ruthless power. I had been sceptical enough about
this Eastern mage, as I had been sceptical about Medina's arts,
because they had failed with me. But as I looked on that dark
countenance I had a vision of a world of terrible knowledge, a
hideousness like an evil smell, but a power like a blasting wind
or a pestilence. . . . Somehow Sandy's talk at the Thursday Club
dinner came back to me, about the real danger to the world lying
in the constraint of spirit over spirit. This swarthy brute was
the priest of that obscene domination, and I had an insane desire
there and then to hammer him into pulp.</p>

<p>He was looking at me, and seemed to be asking a question to
which Medina replied. I fancy he was told that I was a
<i>chela,</i> or whatever was the right name, a well-broken and
submissive disciple.</p>

<p>Then to my surprise he spoke in English--good English, with
the <i>chi-chi</i> accent of the Indian.</p>

<p>"You have followed far in the path of knowledge, brother. I
did not think a son of the West could have travelled so far and
so soon. You have won two of the three keys to Mastery, if you
can make a man forget his past, and begin life anew subject to
your will. But what of the third key?"</p>

<p>I thought Medina's voice had a tinge of disappointment. "It is
the third key which I look for, master. What good is it to wipe
out the past and establish my control if it is only temporary? I
want the third key, to lock the door, so that I have my prisoner
safe for ever. Is there such a key?"</p>

<p>"The key is there, but to find it is not easy. All control
tends to grow weak and may be broken by an accident, except in
the case of young children, and some women, and those of feeble
mind."</p>

<p>"That I know," said Medina almost pettishly. "But I do not
want to make disciples only of babes, idiots, and women."</p>

<p>"Only some women, I said. Among our women perhaps all, but
among Western women, who are hard as men, only the softer and
feebler."</p>

<p>"That is my trouble. I wish to control for ever, and to
control without constant watching on my part. I have a busy life
and time is precious. Tell me, master, is there a way?"</p>

<p>I listened to this conversation with feelings of genuine
horror. Now I saw Medina's plans, and I realised that he and he
alone was at the bottom of the kidnapping. I realised, too, how
he had dealt with the three hostages, and how he proposed to
deal. Compared to him a murderer was innocent, for a murderer
only took life, while he took the soul. I hated him and that dark
scoundrel more intensely than I think I have ever hated man;
indeed it was only by a great effort that I checked myself from
clutching the two by the throat. The three stories, which had
been half forgotten and overlaid by my recent experiences,
returned sharp and clear to my memory. I saw again Victor's
haggard face, I heard Sir Arthur Warcliff's voice break; and my
wrath rose and choked me. This stealing of souls was the worst
infamy ever devised by devils among mankind. I must have showed
my emotion, but happily the two had no eyes for me.</p>

<p>"There is a way, a sure way," the Indian was saying, and a
wicked half-smile flitted over his face. "But it is a way which,
though possible in my own country, may be difficult in yours. I
am given to understand that your police are troublesome, and you
have a public repute, which it is necessary to cherish. There is
another way which is slower, but which is also sure, if it is
boldly entered upon."</p>

<p>The sage seemed to open his half-shut eyes, and I thought I
saw the opaque brightness which comes from drug-taking.</p>

<p>"Him whom you would make your slave," he said, "you first
strip of memory, and then attune to your own will. To keep him
attuned you must be with him often and reinforce the control. But
this is burdensome, and if the slave be kept apart and seen
rarely the influence will ebb--except, as I have said, in the
case of a young child. There is a way to rivet the bondage and it
is this. Take him or her whom you govern into the same life as
they have been accustomed to live before, and there, among
familiar things, assert your control. Your influence will thus
acquire the sanction of familiarity--for though the conscious
memory has gone, the unconscious remains--and presently will be a
second nature."</p>

<p>"I see," said Medina abstractedly. "I had already guessed as
much. Tell me, master, can the dominion, once it is established,
be shaken off?"</p>

<p>"It cannot save by the will of him who exercises it. Only the
master can release."</p>

<p>After that they spoke again in the foreign tongue of I know
not what devilry. It seemed to me that the sage was beginning to
tire of the interview, for he rang a bell and when the servant
appeared gave him some rapid instructions. Medina rose, and
kissed the hand which was held out to him, and I, of course,
followed suit.</p>

<p>"You stay here long, master?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Two days. Then I have business in Paris and elsewhere. But I
return in May, when I will summon you again. Prosper, brother.
The God of Wisdom befriend you."</p>

<p>We went downstairs to the dancing and the supper parties. The
regimental dinner was breaking up and Tom Machin was holding
forth in the hall to a knot of be-medalled friends. I had to say
something to Medina to round off the evening, and the contrast of
the two scenes seemed to give me a cue. As we were putting on our
coats I observed that it was like coming from light to darkness.
He approved. "Like falling from a real world into shadows," he
said.</p>

<p>He evidently wished to follow his own thoughts, for he did not
ask me to walk home with him. I, too, had a lot to think about.
When I got back to the Club I found a note signed "Spion Kop,"
and with an English postmark.</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Meet me," it said, "on the 21st for breakfast at the inn
called 'The Silent Woman' on the Fosse Way as you go over from
Colne to Windrush. I have a lot to tell you."</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>I thanked Heaven that Sandy was home again, though he chose
fantastic spots for his assignations. I, too, had something to
say to him. For that evening had given me an insight into
Medina's mind, and, what was more, the glimmerings of a plan of
my own.</p>

<p>My first impulse was to go to Macgillivray about this
Khar&aacute;ma fellow, who I was certain was up to mischief. I
suspected him of some kind of political intrigue; otherwise what
was he doing touring the capitals of Europe and putting up at
expensive hotels? But on second thoughts I resolved to let the
police alone. I could not explain about Khar&aacute;ma without
bringing in Medina, and I was determined to do nothing which
would stir a breath of suspicion against him. But I got the chit
from my doctor, recommending a week's rest, and I went round to
see Medina on the morning of the 19th. I told him I had been
feeling pretty cheap for some days and that my doctor ordered me
to go home and go to bed. He didn't look pleased, so I showed him
the doctor's letter, and made a poor mouth, as if I hated the
business but was torn between my inclinations and my duty. I
think he liked my producing that chit, like a second-lieutenant
asking for leave, anyhow he made the best of it and was quite
sympathetic. "I'm sorry you're going out of town," he said, "for
I want you badly. But it's as well to get quite fit, and to lie
up for a week ought to put you all right. When am I to expect you
back?" I told him that without fail I would be in London on the
29th. "I'm going to disappear into a monastery," I said. "Write
no letters, receive none, not at home to visitors, only sleep and
eat. I can promise you that my wife will watch me like a
dragon."</p>

<p>Then I hunted up Archie Roylance, whom I found on the very top
of his form. He had seen Hansen, and discovered that on the
island of Flacksholm, just off the mouth of the Merdalfjord,
there was good landing. It was a big flattish island with a loch
in the centre, and entirely uninhabited except for a farm at the
south end. Archie had got a machine, a Sopwith, which he said he
could trust, and I arranged with him to be at Flacksholm not
later than the 27th, and to camp there as best he could. He was
to keep watch by day for a motor-boat from the Merdalfjord, and
at night if he saw a green light he was to make for it. I told
him to take ample supplies, and he replied that he wasn't such a
fool as to neglect the commissariat. He said he had been to
Fortnum &amp; Mason and was going to load up with liqueurs and
<i>delicatessen.</i> "Take all the clothes you've got, Dick," he
added. "It will be perishing cold in those parts at this time of
year." He arranged, too, to cable through Hansen for a
motor-launch to be ready at Stavanger for a Mr. Brand who was due
by the Hull steamer on the morning of the 23rd. If I had to
change my plans I was to wire him at once.</p>

<p>That evening I went down to Fosse a little easier in my mind.
It was a blessed relief to get out of London and smell clean air,
and to reflect that for a week at any rate I should be engaged in
a more congenial job than loafing about town. I found Peter John
in the best of health and the Manor garden a glory of spring
flowers.</p>

<p>I told Mary that I was ordered by my doctor to go to bed for a
week and take a rest cure.</p>

<p>"Dick," she asked anxiously, "you're not ill, are you?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit, only a trifle stale. But officially I'm to be in
bed for a week and not a blessed soul is to be allowed to come
near me. Tell the servants, please, and get the cook on to
invalid dishes. I'll take Paddock into my confidence, and he'll
keep up a show of waiting on me."</p>

<p>"A show?"</p>

<p>"Yes, for you see I'm going to put in a week in Norway--that
is, unless Sandy has anything to say against it."</p>

<p>"But I thought Colonel Arbuthnot was still abroad?"</p>

<p>"So he is--officially. But I'm going to breakfast with him the
day after to-morrow at The Silent Woman--you remember, the inn we
used to have supper at last summer when I was fishing the
Colne."</p>

<p>"Dick," she said solemnly, "isn't it time you told me a little
more about what you're doing?"</p>

<p>"I think it is," I agreed, and that night after dinner I told
her everything.</p>

<p>She asked a great many questions, searching questions, for
Mary's brain was about twice as good as mine. Then she sat
pondering for a long time with her chin on her hand.</p>

<p>"I wish I had met Mr. Medina," she said at last. "Aunt Claire
and Aunt Doria know him. . . . I am afraid of him, terribly
afraid, and I think I should be less afraid if I could just see
him once. It is horrible, Dick, and you are fighting with such
strange weapons. Your only advantage is that you're such a
gnarled piece of oak. I wish I could help. It's dreadful to have
to wait here and be tortured by anxiety for you, and to be
thinking all the time of those poor people. I can't get the
little boy out of my head. I often wake in a terror, and have to
go up to the night-nursery to hug Peter John. Nanny must think
I'm mad. . . . I suppose you're right to go to Norway?"</p>

<p>"I see no other way. We have a clue to the whereabouts of one
of the hostages--I haven't a notion which. I must act on that,
and besides, if I find one it may give me a line on the
others."</p>

<p>"There will still be two lost," she said, "and the time grows
fearfully short. You are only one man. Can you not get helpers?
Mr. Macgillivray?"</p>

<p>"No. He has his own job, and to let him into mine would wreck
both."</p>

<p>"Well, Colonel Arbuthnot? What is he doing?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Sandy's busy enough, and, thank God! he's back in
England. I'll know more about his game when I see him, but you
may be sure it's a deep one. While I'm away Sandy will be working
all the time."</p>

<p>"Do you know, I have never met him. Couldn't I see him some
time when you're away? It would be a great comfort to me. And,
Dick, can't I help somehow? We've always shared everything, even
before we were married, and you know I'm dependable."</p>

<p>"Indeed I do, my darling," I said. "But I can't see how you
can help--yet. If I could, I would inspan you straight off, for I
would rather have you with me than a regiment."</p>

<p>"It's the poor little boy. I could endure the rest, but the
thought of him makes me crazy. Have you seen Sir Arthur?"</p>

<p>"No, I have avoided him. I can stand the sight of Victor and
the Duke, but I swear I shall never look Sir Arthur in the face
unless I can hand him over his son."</p>

<p>Then Mary got up and stood over me like a delivering
angel.</p>

<p>"It is going to be done," she cried. "Dick, you must never
give up. I believe in my heart we shall win. We must win or I
shall never be able to kiss Peter John again with a quiet mind.
Oh, I wish--I wish I could do something."</p>

<p>I don't think Mary slept that night, and next morning she was
rather pale and her eyes had that funny long-sighted look that
they had had when I said good-bye to her at Amiens in March '18,
before going up to the line.</p>

<p>I spent a blissful day with her and Peter John wandering round
our little estate. It was one of those April days which seem to
have been borrowed from late May, when you have the warmth of
summer joined with the austerity and fresh colouring of spring.
The riot of daffodils under the trees was something to thank God
for, the banks of the little lake were one cascade of grape
hyacinths, blue and white, and every dell in the woods was bright
with primroses. We occupied the morning deepening the pools in a
tiny stream which was to be one of the spawning-grounds for the
new trout in the lake, and Peter John showed conspicuous talent
as a hydraulic engineer. His nurse, who was a middle-aged
Scotswoman from the Cheviots, finally carried him off for his
morning rest, and when he had gone, Mary desisted from her watery
excavations and sat down on a bank of periwinkles.</p>

<p>"What do you really think of Nanny?" she asked.</p>

<p>"About as good as they make," I replied.</p>

<p>"That's what I think too. You know, Dick, I feel I'm far too
fussy about Peter John. I give hours of my time to him, and it's
quite unnecessary. Nanny can do everything better than I can. I
scarcely dare let him out of my sight, and yet I'm certain that I
could safely leave him for weeks with Nanny and Paddock--and Dr.
Greenslade within call."</p>

<p>"Of course you could," I agreed, "but you'd miss him, as I do,
for he's jolly good company."</p>

<p>"Yes, he's jolly good company, the dear fellow," she said.</p>

<p>In the afternoon we went for a canter on the downs, and I came
back feeling as fit as a race-horse and keyed up for anything.
But that evening, as we walked in the garden before dinner, I had
another fit of longing to be free of the business and to return
to my quiet life. I realised that I had buried my heart in my
pleasant acres, and the thought of how much I loved them made me
almost timid. I think Mary understood what I was feeling, for she
insisted on talking about David Warcliff, and before I went to
bed had worked me into that honest indignation which is the best
stiffener of resolution. She went over my plans with me very
carefully. On the 28th, if I could manage it, I was to come home,
but if I was short of time I was to send her a wire and go
straight to London. The pretence of my being in bed was to be
religiously kept up. For safety's sake I was to sign every wire
with the name of Cornelius.</p>

<p>Very early next morning, long before anyone was stirring, I
started the big Vauxhall with Paddock's assistance, and,
accompanied by a very modest kit, crept down the avenue. Paddock,
who could drive a car, was to return to the house about ten
o'clock, and explain to my chauffeur that by my orders he had
taken the Vauxhall over to Oxford as a loan for a week to a
friend of mine. I drove fast out of the silent hill roads and on
to the great Roman way which lay like a strap across the
highlands. It was not much after six o'clock when I reached The
Silent Woman, which sat like an observation post on a ridge of
down, at a junction of four roads. Smoke was going up from its
chimneys, so I judged that Sandy had ordered early breakfast.
Presently, as I was garaging the car in an outhouse, Sandy
appeared in flannel bags and a tweed jacket, looking as fresh as
paint and uncommonly sunburnt.</p>

<p>"I hope you're hungry," he said. "Capital fellow the landlord!
He knows what a man's appetite is. I ordered eggs, kidneys,
sausages and cold ham, and he seemed to expect it. Yes. These are
my headquarters for the present, though Advanced G.H.Q. is
elsewhere. By the by, Dick, just for an extra precaution, my
name's Thomson--Alexander Thomson--and I'm a dramatic critic
taking a belated Easter holiday."</p>

<p>The breakfast was as good as Sandy had promised, and what with
the run in the fresh air and the sight of him opposite me I began
to feel light-hearted.</p>

<p>"I got your letters," I said, "but, I say, your knowledge of
Derby winners is pretty rocky. I thought that was the kind of
information no gentleman was without."</p>

<p>"I'm the exception. Did you act on them?"</p>

<p>"I told Medina I had broken with you for good and never wanted
to see your face again. But why did you make such a point of
it?"</p>

<p>"Simply because I wanted to be rid of his attentions, and I
reckoned that if he thought we had quarrelled and that I had gone
off for good, he might let me alone. You see he has been trying
hard to murder me."</p>

<p>"Good Lord!" I exclaimed. "When?"</p>

<p>"Four times," said Sandy calmly, counting on his fingers.
"Once before I left London. Oh, I can tell you I had an exciting
departure. Three times in Paris, the last time only four days
ago. I fancy he's off my trail now, for he really thinks I sailed
from Marseilles the day before yesterday."</p>

<p>"But why on earth?"</p>

<p>"Well, I made some ill-advised remarks at the Thursday Club
dinner. He believes that I'm the only man alive who might uncover
him, and he won't sleep peacefully till he knows that I am out of
Europe and is convinced that I suspect nothing. I sent you those
letters because I wanted to be let alone, seeing I had a lot to
do, and nothing wastes time like dodging assassins. But my chief
reason was to protect <i>you.</i> You mayn't know it, Dick, but
you've been walking for three weeks on the edge of a precipice
with one foot nearly over. You've been in the most hideous
danger, and I was never more relieved in my life than when I saw
your solemn old face this morning. You were only safe when he
regarded our friendship as broken and me out of the way and you
his blind and devoted slave."</p>

<p>"I'm that all right," I said. "There's been nothing like it
since Uncle Tom's Cabin."</p>

<p>"Good. That's the great thing, for it gives us a post in the
enemy's citadel. But we're only at the beginning of a tremendous
fight and there's no saying how it will go. Have you sized up
Medina?"</p>

<p>"Only a little bit. Have you?"</p>

<p>"I'm on the road. He's the most complex thing I've ever
struck. But now we've got to pool our knowledge. Shall I
start?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Begin at the Thursday dinner. What started you off then?
I could see that something he said intrigued you."</p>

<p>"I must begin before that. You see, I'd heard a good deal
about Medina up and down the world and couldn't for the life of
me place him. Everybody swore by him, but I had always a queer
feeling about the man. I told you about Lavater. Well, I had
nothing to go upon there except the notion that his influence
upon my friend had been bad. So I began making inquiries, and, as
you know, I've more facilities than most people for finding
things out. I was curious to know what he had been doing during
the War. The ordinary story was that he had been for the first
two years pretty well lost in Central Asia, where he had gone on
a scientific expedition, and that after that he had been with the
Russians, and had finished up by doing great work with Denikin. I
went into that story and discovered that he had been in Central
Asia all right, but had never been near any fighting front and
had never been within a thousand miles of Denikin. That's what I
meant when I told you that I believed the man was one vast
lie."</p>

<p>"He made everybody believe it."</p>

<p>"That's the point. He made the whole world believe what he
wanted. Therefore he must be something quite out of the common--a
propagandist of genius. That was my first conclusion. But how did
he work? He must have a wonderful organisation, but he must have
something more--the kind of personality which can diffuse itself
like an atmosphere and which, like an electric current, is not
weakened by distance. He must also have unique hypnotic powers. I
had made a study of that in the East and had discovered how
little we know here about the compulsion of spirit by spirit.
That, I have always believed, is to-day, and ever has been, the
true magic. You remember I said something about that at the
Thursday dinner?"</p>

<p>I nodded. "I suppose you did it to try him?"</p>

<p>"Yes. It wasn't very wise, for I might easily have frightened
him. But I was luckier than I deserved, and I drew from him a
tremendous confession."</p>

<p>"The Latin quotation?"</p>

<p>"The Latin quotation. <i>Sit vini abstemius qui hermeneuma
tentat aut hominum petit dominatum.</i> I nearly had a fit when I
heard it. Listen, Dick. I've always had a craze for recondite
subjects, and when I was at Oxford I wasted my time on them when
I should have been working for my schools. I only got a third in
Greats, but I acquired a lot of unusual information. One of my
subjects was Michael Scott. Yes--the wizard, only he wasn't a
wizard, but a very patient and original thinker. He was a
Borderer like me, and I started out to write a life of him. I
kept up the study, and when I was at the Paris Embassy I spent my
leisure tracking him through the libraries of Europe. Most of his
works were published in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries,
and mighty dull they are, but there are some still in manuscript,
and I had always the hope of discovering more, for I was positive
that the real Michael Scott was something far bigger than the
translator and commentator whom we know. I believed that he
taught the mad Emperor Ferdinand some queer things, and that the
centre of his teaching was just how one human soul could control
another. Well, as it turned out, I was right. I found some leaves
of manuscript in the Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale, which I was
certain were to be attributed to Michael. One of his best-known
works, you remember, is the <i>Physionomia,</i> but that is only
a version of Aristotle. This, too, was part of a
<i>Physionomia,</i> and a very different thing from the other,
for it purported to give the essence of the <i>Secreta
Secretorum</i>--it would take too long to explain about that--and
the teaching of the Therapeutae, with Michael's own comments. It
is a manual of the arts of spiritual control--oh, amazingly
up-to-date, I assure you, and a long way ahead of our foolish
psycho-analysts. Well, that quotation of Medina's comes from that
fragment--the rare word 'hermeneuma' caught my attention as soon
as he uttered it. That proved that Medina was a student of
Michael Scott, and showed me what was the bent of his mind."</p>

<p>"Well, he gave himself away then, and you didn't."</p>

<p>"Oh yes, I did. You remember I asked him if he knew the
<i>guru</i> who lived at the foot of the Shansi pass as you go
over to Kaikand? That was a bad blunder, and it is on account of
that question that he has been trying to remove me from the
earth. For it was from that <i>guru</i> that he learned most of
his art."</p>

<p>"Was the <i>guru's</i> name Khar&aacute;ma?" I asked.</p>

<p>Sandy stared as if he had seen a ghost.</p>

<p>"Now how on earth do you know that?"</p>

<p>"Simply because I spent an hour with him and Medina a few
nights ago."</p>

<p>"The devil you did! Khar&aacute;ma in London! Lord, Dick, this
is an awesome business. Quick, tell me every single thing that
passed."</p>

<p>I told him as well as I remembered, and he seemed to forget
his alarm and to be well satisfied. "This is tremendously
important. You see the point of Medina's talk? He wants to rivet
his control over those three unfortunate devils, and to do that
he is advised to assert it in some environment similar to that of
their past lives. That gives us a chance to get on their track.
And the control can only be released by him who first imposed it!
I happened to know that, but I was not sure that Medina knew it.
It is highly important to have found this out."</p>

<p>"Finish your story," I begged him. "I want to know what you
have been doing abroad?"</p>

<p>"I continued my studies in the Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale,
and I found that, as I suspected, Medina, or somebody like him,
had got on to the Michael Scott MS. and had had a transcript made
of it. I pushed my researches further, for Michael wasn't the
only pebble on the beach, though he was the biggest. Lord, Dick,
it's a queer business in a problem like ours to have to dig for
help in the debris of the Middle Ages. I found out something--not
much, but something."</p>

<p>"And then?"</p>

<p>"Oh, all the time I was making inquiries about Medina's
past--not very fruitful--I've told you most of the results. Then
I went to see Ram Dass--you remember my speaking about him. I
thought he was in Munich, but I found him in Westphalia, keeping
an eye on the German industrials. Don't go to Germany for a
holiday, Dick; it's a sad country and a comfortless. I had to see
Ram Dass, for he happens to be the brother of
Khar&aacute;ma."</p>

<p>"What size of a fellow is Khar&aacute;ma?" I asked.</p>

<p>Sandy's reply was: "For knowledge of the practice unequalled
but only a second-class practitioner"--exactly what Medina had
said.</p>

<p>"Ram Dass told me most of what I wanted to know. But he isn't
aware that his brother is in Europe. I rather fancy he thinks he
is dead. . . . That's all I need tell you now. Fire away, Dick,
and give me an exact account of your own doings."</p>

<p>I explained as best I could the gradual change in Medina's
manner from friendship to proprietorship. I told how he had begun
to talk freely to me, as if I were a disciple, and I described
that extraordinary evening in Hill Street when I had met his
mother."</p>

<p>"His mother!" Sandy exclaimed, and made me go over every
incident several times--the slap in the face, the spitting, my
ultimate fainting. He seemed to enjoy it immensely. "Good
business," he said. "You never did a better day's work, old
man."</p>

<p>"I have found the Blind Spinner at any rate," I said.</p>

<p>"Yes. I had half guessed it. I didn't mention it, but when I
got into the house in Gospel Oak as the electric light man, I
found a spinning-wheel in the back room, and they had been
burning peat on the hearth. Well, that's Number One."</p>

<p>"I think I am on my way to find Number Two," I said, and I
told him of the talk I had overheard between the two about
<i>secundus</i> and sending "the doctor" somewhere, and of how I
had discovered that Dr. Newhover was starting this very day for
the Skarso. "It's the first clear clue," I said, "and I think I
ought to follow it up."</p>

<p>"Yes. What do you propose to do?"</p>

<p>"I am travelling this evening on the <i>Gudrun</i> and I'm
going to trail the fellow till I find out his game. I'm bound to
act upon what little information we've got."</p>

<p>"I agree. But this means a long absence from London, and
<i>secundus</i> is only one of three."</p>

<p>"Just a week," I said. "I've got sick leave from Medina for a
week, and I'm supposed to be having a rest cure at Fosse, with
Mary warding off visitors. I've arranged with Archie Roylance to
pick me up in an aeroplane about the 28th and bring me back. It
doesn't allow me much time, but an active man can do the deuce of
a lot in a week."</p>

<p>"Bravo!" he cried. "That's your old moss-trooping self!"</p>

<p>"Do you approve?"</p>

<p>"Entirely. And, whatever happens, you present yourself to
Medina on the 29th? That leaves us about six weeks for the rest
of the job."</p>

<p>"More like five," I said gloomily, and I told him how I had
learnt that the gang proposed to liquidate by midsummer, and that
Macgillivray had therefore moved the date when he would take
action ten days forward. "You see how we are placed. He must
collect all the gang at the same moment, and we must release all
three hostages, if we can, at the same time. The releasing
mustn't be done too soon or it will warn the gang. Therefore if
Macgillivray strikes on the 10th of June, we must be ready to
strike not earlier than the 9th and, of course, not later."</p>

<p>"I see," he said, and was silent for a little. "Have you
anything more to tell me?"</p>

<p>I ransacked my memory and remembered about Odell. He wrote
down the name of the dancing club where I had seen that
unprepossessing butler. I mentioned that I had asked Macgillivray
to get on to his <i>dossier.</i></p>

<p>"You haven't told Macgillivray too much?" he inquired
anxiously and seemed relieved when I replied that I had never
mentioned the Medina business.</p>

<p>"Well, here's the position," he said at last. "You go off for
a week hunting Number Two. We are pretty certain that we have got
Number One. Number Three--that nonsense about the fields of Eden
and the Jew with a dyed beard in a curiosity shop in
Marylebone--still eludes us. And of course we have as yet no word
of any of the three hostages. There's a terrible lot still to do.
How do you envisage the thing, Dick? Do you think of the three,
the girl, the young man, and the boy, shut up somewhere and
guarded by Medina's minions? Do you imagine that if we find their
places of concealment we shall have done the job?"</p>

<p>"That was my idea."</p>

<p>He shook his head. "It is far subtler than that. Did no one
ever tell you that the best way of hiding a person is to strip
him of his memory? Why is it that when a man loses his memory he
is so hard to find? You see it constantly in the newspapers. Even
a well-known figure, if he loses his memory and wanders away, is
only discovered by accident. The reason is that the human
personality is identified far less by appearance than by its
habits and mind. Loss of memory means the loss of all true marks
of identification, and the physical look alters to correspond.
Medina has stolen these three poor souls' memories and set them
adrift like waifs. David Warcliff may at this moment be playing
in a London gutter along with a dozen guttersnipes and his own
father could scarcely pick him out from the rest. Mercot may be a
dock labourer or a deck hand, whom you wouldn't recognise if you
met him, though you had sat opposite him in a college hall every
night for a year. And Miss Victor may be in a gaiety chorus or a
milliner's assistant or a girl in a dancing saloon. . . . Wait a
minute. You saw Odell at a dance-club? There may be something in
that." I could see his eyes abstracted in thought.</p>

<p>"There's another thing I forgot to mention," I said. "Miss
Victor's fianc&eacute; is over here, staying in Carlton House
Terrace. He is old Turpin, who used to be with the division--the
Marquis de la Tour du Pin."</p>

<p>Sandy wrote the name down. "Her fianc&eacute;. He may come in
useful. What sort of fellow?"</p>

<p>"Brave as a lion, but he'll want watching, for he's a bit of a
Gascon."</p>

<p>We went out after breakfast and sat in an arbour looking down
a shallow side-valley to the upper streams of the Windrush. The
sounds of morning were beginning to rise from the little village
far away in the bottom, the jolt of a wagon, the "clink-clenk"
from the smithy, the babble of children at play. In a fortnight
the may-fly would be here, and every laburnum and guelder rose in
bloom. Sandy, who had been away from England for years, did not
speak for a long time, but drank in the sweet-scented peace of
it. "Poor devil," he said at last. "He has nothing like this to
love. He can only hate."</p>

<p>I asked whom he was talking about, and he said "Medina."</p>

<p>"I'm trying to understand him. You can't fight a man unless
you understand him, and in a way sympathise with him."</p>

<p>"Well, I can't say I sympathise with him, and I most certainly
don't understand him."</p>

<p>"Do you remember once telling me that he had no vanity? You
were badly out there. He has a vanity which amounts to
delirium.</p>

<p>"This is how I read him," he went on. "To begin with, there's
a far-away streak of the Latin in him, but he is mainly Irish,
and that never makes a good cross. He's the
<i>d&eacute;racin&eacute;</i> Irish, such as you find in America.
I take it that he imbibed from that terrible old woman--I've
never met her, but I see her plainly and I know that she is
terrible--he imbibed that venomous hatred of imaginary things--an
imaginary England, an imaginary civilisation, which they call
love of country. There is no love in it. They think there is, and
sentimentalise about an old simplicity, and spinning wheels and
turf fires and an uncouth language, but it's all hollow. There's
plenty of decent plain folk in Ireland, but his kind of
<i>d&eacute;racin&eacute;</i> is a ghastly throw-back to
something you find in the dawn of history, hollow and cruel like
the fantastic gods of their own myths. Well, you start with this
ingrained hate."</p>

<p>"I agree about the old lady. She looked like Lady
Macbeth."</p>

<p>"But hate soon becomes conceit. If you hate, you despise, and
when you despise you esteem inordinately the self which despises.
This is how I look at it, but remember, I'm still in the dark and
only feeling my way to an understanding. I see Medina growing
up--I don't know in what environment--conscious of great talents
and immense good looks, flattered by those around him till he
thinks himself a god. His hatred does not die, but it is
transformed into a colossal egotism and vanity, which, of course,
is a form of hate. He discovers quite early that he has this
remarkable hypnotic power--Oh, you may laugh at it, because you
happen to be immune from it, but it is a big thing in the world
for all that. He discovers another thing--that he has an
extraordinary gift of attracting people and making them believe
in him. Some of the worst scoundrels in history have had it. Now,
remember his vanity. It makes him want to play the biggest game.
He does not want to be a king among pariahs; he wants to be the
ruler of what is most strange to him, what he hates and in an
unwilling bitter way admires. So he aims at conquering the very
heart, the very soundest part of our society. Above all he wants
to be admired by men and admitted into the innermost circle."</p>

<p>"He has succeeded all right," I said.</p>

<p>"He has succeeded, and that is the greatest possible tribute
to his huge cleverness. Everything about him is dead
right--clothes, manner, modesty, accomplishments. He has made
himself an excellent sportsman. Do you know why he shoots so
well, Dick? By faith--or fatalism, if you like. His vanity
doesn't allow him to believe that he could miss. . . . But he
governs himself strictly. In his life he is practically an
ascetic, and though he is adored by women he doesn't care a straw
for them. There are no lusts of the flesh in that kind of
character. He has one absorbing passion which subdues all
others--what our friend Michael Scott called 'hominum
dominatus.'"</p>

<p>"I see that. But how do you explain the other side?"</p>

<p>"It is all the ancestral hate. First of all, of course, he has
got to have money, so he gets it in the way Macgillivray knows
about. Second, he wants to build up a regiment of faithful
slaves. That's where you come in, Dick. There is always that
inhuman hate at the back of his egotism. He wants to conquer in
order to destroy, for destruction is the finest meat for his
vanity. You'll find the same thing in the lives of Eastern
tyrants, for when a man aspires to be like God he becomes an
incarnate devil."</p>

<p>"It is a tough proposition," I observed dismally.</p>

<p>"It would be an impossible proposition, but for one thing. He
is always in danger of giving himself away out of sheer
arrogance. Did you ever read the old Irish folk-lore? Very
beautiful it is, but there is always something fantastic and
silly which mars the finest stories. They lack the grave
good-sense which you find in the Norse sagas and, of course, in
the Greek. Well, he has this freakish element in his blood. That
is why he sent out that rhyme about the three hostages, which by
an amazing concatenation of chances put you on to his trail. Our
hope is--and, mind you, I think it is a slender hope--that his
vanity may urge him to further indiscretions."</p>

<p>"I don't know how you feel about it," I said, "but I've got a
pretty healthy hatred for that lad. I'm longing for a quiet life,
but I swear I won't settle down again till I've got even with
him."</p>

<p>"You never will," said Sandy solemnly. "Don't let's flatter
ourselves that you and I are going to down Medina. We are not. A
very wise man once said to me that in this life you could often
get success, if you didn't want victory. In this case we're out
for success only. We want to release the hostages. Victory we can
never hope for. Why, man, supposing we succeed fully, we'll never
be able to connect Medina with the thing. His tools are faithful,
because he has stolen their souls and they work blindly under
him. Supposing Macgillivray rounds up all the big gang and puts
the halter round their necks. There will be none of them to turn
King's evidence and give Medina away. Why? Because none of them
<i>know</i> anything against him. They're his unconscious agents,
and very likely most have never seen him. And you may be pretty
sure that his banking accounts are too skilfully arranged to show
anything."</p>

<p>"All the same," I said stubbornly, "I have a notion that I'll
be able to put a spoke in his wheel."</p>

<p>"Oh, I dare say we can sow suspicion, but I believe he'll be
too strong for us. He'll advance in his glorious career, and may
become Prime Minister--or Viceroy of India--what a chance the
second would be for him!--and publish exquisite little poetry
books, as finished and melancholy as <i>The Shropshire Lad.</i>
Pessimism, you know, is often a form of vanity."</p>

<p>At midday it was time for me to be off, if I was to be at Hull
by six o'clock. I asked Sandy what he proposed to do next, and he
said he was undecided. "My position," he said, "badly cramps my
form. It would be ruination if Medina knew I was in
England--ruination for both you and me. Mr. Alexander Thomson
must lie very low. I must somehow get in touch with Macgillivray
to hear if he has anything about Odell. I rather fancy Odell. But
there will probably be nothing doing till you come back, and I
think I'll have a little fishing."</p>

<p>"Suppose I want to get hold of you?"</p>

<p>"Suppose nothing of the kind. You mustn't make any move in my
direction. That's our only safety. If I want you I'll come to
you."</p>

<p>As I was starting he said suddenly: "I've never met your wife,
Dick. What about my going over to Fosse and introducing
myself?"</p>

<p>"The very thing," I cried. "She is longing to meet you. But
remember that I'm supposed to be lying sick upstairs."</p>

<p>As I looked back he was waving his hand, and his face wore its
familiar elfish smile.</p>

<h1><a name="c11">CHAPTER XI</a></h1>

<h1>HOW A GERMAN ENGINEER FOUND STRANGE FISHING</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>I got to Hull about six o'clock, having left my car at a
garage in York, and finished the journey by train. I had my kit
in a small suit-case and rucksack, and I waited on the quay till
I saw Dr. Newhover arrive with a lot of luggage and a big
rod-box. When I reckoned he would be in his cabin arranging his
belongings, I went on board myself, and went straight to my own
cabin, which was a comfortable two-berthed one well forward.
There I had sandwiches brought me, and settled myself to doze and
read for thirty-six hours.</p>

<p>All that night and all next day it blew fairly hard, and I
remained quietly in my bunk, trying to read Boswell's <i>Life of
Johnson,</i> and thanking my stars that I hadn't lived a thousand
years earlier and been a Viking. I didn't see myself ploughing
those short steep seas in an open galley. I woke on the morning
of the 23rd to find the uneasy motion at an end, and, looking out
of my port-hole, saw a space of green sunlit water, a rocky
beach, and the white and red of a little town. The <i>Gudrun</i>
waited about an hour at Stavanger, so I gave Dr. Newhover time to
get on shore, before I had a hurried breakfast in the saloon and
followed him. I saw him go off with two men, and get on board a
motor-launch which was lying beside one of the jetties. The coast
was now clear, so I went into the town, found the agents to whom
Archie Roylance had cabled, and learned that my own motor-launch
was ready and waiting in the inner harbour where the
fishing-boats lie. A clerk took me down there, and introduced me
to Johan, my skipper, a big, cheerful, bearded Norwegian, who had
a smattering of English. I bought a quantity of provisions, and
by ten o'clock we were on the move. I asked Johan about the route
to Merdal, and he pointed out a moving speck a couple of miles
ahead of us. "That is Kristian Egge's boat," he said. "He carries
an English fisherman to Merdal and we follow." I got my glasses
on the craft, and made out Newhover smoking in the stern.</p>

<p>It was a gorgeous day, with that funny Northern light which
makes noon seem like early morning. I enjoyed every hour of it,
partly because I had now a definite job before me, and partly
because I was in the open air to which I properly belonged. I got
no end of amusement watching the wild life--the cormorants and
eider-duck on the little islands, and the seals, with heads as
round as Medina's, that slipped off the skerries at our approach.
The air was chilly and fresh, but when we turned the corner of
the Merdalfjord out of the sea-wind and the sun climbed the sky
it was as warm as June. A big flat island we passed, all short
turf and rocky outcrops, was pointed out to me by Johan as
Flacksholm. Soon we were shaping due east in an inlet which was
surrounded by dark steep hills, with the snow lying in the
gullies. I had Boswell with me in two volumes; the first I had
read in the steamer, and the second I was now starting on, when
it fell overboard, through my getting up in a hurry to look at a
flock of duck. So I presented the odd volume to Johan, and
surrendered myself to tobacco and meditation.</p>

<p>In the afternoon the inlet narrowed to a fjord, and the walls
of hill grew steeper. They were noble mountains, cut sharp like
the edge of the Drakensberg, and crowned with a line of snow, so
that they looked like a sugar-coated cake that had been sliced.
Streams came out of the upper snow-wreaths and hurled themselves
down the steeps--above a shimmering veil of mist, and below a
torrent of green water tumbling over pebbles to the sea. The
landscape and the weather lulled me into a delectable peace which
refused to be disturbed by any "looking before or after," as some
poet says. Newhover was ahead of me--we never lost track of his
launch--and it was my business to see what he was up to and to
keep myself out of his sight. The ways and means of it I left to
fortune to provide.</p>

<p>By and by the light grew dimmer, and the fjord grew narrower,
so that dusk fell on us, though, looking back down the inlet, we
could see a bright twilight. I assumed that Newhover would go on
to Merdal and the fjord's head, where the Skarso entered the sea,
and had decided to stop at Hauge, a village two miles short of
it, on the south shore. We came to Hauge about half-past eight,
in a wonderful purple dusk, for the place lay right under the
shadow of a great cliff. I gave Johan full instructions: he was
to wait for me and expect me when I turned up, and to provision
himself from the village. On no account must he come up to
Merdal, or go out of sight or hail of the boat. He seemed to
relish the prospect of a few days' idleness, for he landed me at
a wooden jetty in great good-humour, and wished me sport. What he
thought I was after I cannot imagine, for I departed with a
rucksack on my back and a stout stick in my hand, which scarcely
suggested the chase.</p>

<p>I was in good spirits myself as I stretched my legs on the
road which led from Hauge to Merdal. The upper fjord lay black on
my left hand, the mountains rose black on my right, but though I
walked in darkness I could see twilight ahead of me, where the
hills fell back from the Skarso valley, that wonderful
apple-green twilight which even in spring is all the northern
night. I had never seen it before, and I suppose something in my
blood answered to the place--for my father used to say that the
Hannays came originally from Norse stock. There was a jolly
crying of birds from the waters, ducks and geese and
oyster-catchers and sandpipers, and now and then would come a
great splash as if a salmon were jumping in the brackish tides on
his way to the Skarso. I was thinking longingly of my rods left
behind, when on turning a corner the lights of Merdal showed
ahead, and it seemed to me that I had better be thinking of my
next step.</p>

<p>I knew no Norwegian, but I counted on finding natives who
could speak English, seeing so many of them have been in England
or America. Newhover, I assumed, would go to the one hotel, and
it was for me to find lodgings elsewhere. I began to think this
spying business might be more difficult than I had thought, for
if he saw me he would recognise me, and that must not happen. I
was ready, of course, with a story of a walking tour, but he
would be certain to suspect, and certain to let Medina know. . .
. Well, a lodging for the night was my first business, and I must
start inquiries. Presently I came to the little pier of Merdal,
which was short of the village itself. There were several men
sitting smoking on barrels and coils of rope, and one who stood
at the end looking out to where Kristian Egge's boat, which had
brought Newhover, lay moored. I turned down the road to it, for
it seemed a place to gather information.</p>

<p>I said good evening to the men, and was just about to ask them
for advice about quarters, when the man who had been looking out
to sea turned round at the sound of my voice. He seemed an oldish
fellow, with rather a stoop in his back, wearing an ancient
shooting-jacket. The light was bad, but there was something in
the cut of his jib that struck me as familiar, though I couldn't
put a name to it.</p>

<p>I spoke to the Norwegians in English, but it was obvious that
I had hit on a bunch of indifferent linguists. They shook their
heads, and one pointed to the village, as if to tell me that I
would be better understood there. Then the man in the
shooting-jacket spoke.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I can help," he said. "There is a good inn in Merdal,
which at this season is not full."</p>

<p>He spoke excellent English, but it was obvious that he wasn't
an Englishman. There was an unmistakable emphasis of the
gutturals.</p>

<p>"I doubt the inn may be too good for my purse," I said. "I am
on a walking-tour and must lodge cheaply."</p>

<p>He laughed pleasantly. "There may be accommodation elsewhere.
Peter Bojer may have a spare bed. I am going that way, sir, and
can direct you."</p>

<p>He had turned towards me, and his figure caught the beam of
the riding-light of the motor-launch. I saw a thin sunburnt face
with a very pleasant expression, and an untidy grizzled beard.
Then I knew him, and I could have shouted with amazement at the
chance which had brought us two together again.</p>

<p>We walked side by side up the jetty road and on to the
highway.</p>

<p>"I think," I said, "that we have met before, Herr
Gaudian."</p>

<p>He stopped short. "That is my name . . . but I do not . . . I
do not think . . ."</p>

<p>"Do you remember a certain Dutchman called Cornelius Brandt
whom you entertained at your country house one night in December
'15?"</p>

<p>He looked searchingly in my face.</p>

<p>"I remember," he said. "I also remember a Mr. Richard Hanau,
one of Guggenheim's engineers, with whom I talked at
Constantinople."</p>

<p>"The same," I said. For a moment I was not clear how he was
going to take the revelation, but his next action reassured me,
and I saw that I had not been wrong in my estimate of the one
German I have ever wholeheartedly liked. He began to laugh, a
friendly tolerant laugh.</p>

<p><i>"Kritzi Turken!"</i> he cried. "It is indeed romantic. I
have often wondered whether I should see or hear of you again,
and behold! you step out of the darkness on a Norwegian
fjord."</p>

<p>"You bear no malice?" I said. "I served my country as you
served yours. I played fair, as you played fair."</p>

<p>"Malice!" he cried. "But we are gentlemen; also we are not
children. I rejoice to see that you have survived the War. I have
always wished you well, for you are a very bold and brave
man."</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it," I said--"only lucky."</p>

<p>"By what name shall I call you now--Brandt or Hanau?"</p>

<p>"My name is Richard Hannay, but for the present I am calling
myself Cornelius Brand--for a reason which I am going to tell
you." I had suddenly made up my mind to take Gaudian into my full
confidence. He seemed to have been sent by Providence for that
purpose, and I was not going to let such a chance slip.</p>

<p>But at my words he stopped short.</p>

<p>"Mr. Hannay," he said, "I do not want your confidence. You are
still engaged, I take it, in your country's service? I do not
question your motive, but remember I am a German, and I cannot be
party to the pursuit of one of my countrymen, however base I may
think him."</p>

<p>I could only stare. "But I am not in my country's service," I
stammered. "I left it at the Armistice, and I'm a farmer
now."</p>

<p>"Do English farmers travel in Norway under false names?"</p>

<p>"That's a private business which I want to explain to you. I
assure you there is no German in it. I want to keep an eye on the
doings of a fashionable English doctor."</p>

<p>"I must believe you," he said after a pause. "But two hours
ago a man arrived in the launch you see anchored out there. He is
a fisherman and is now at the inn. That man is known to me--too
well known. He is a German, who during the War served Germany in
secret ways, in America and elsewhere. I did not love him and I
think he did my country grievous ill, but that is a matter for us
Germans to settle, and not for foreigners."</p>

<p>"I know your man as Dr. Newhover of Wimpole Street."</p>

<p>"So?" he said. "He has taken again his father's name, which
was Neuhofer. We knew him as Kristoffer. What do you want with
him?"</p>

<p>"Nothing that any honest German wouldn't approve," and there
and then I gave him a sketch of the Medina business. He exclaimed
in horror.</p>

<p>"Mr. Hannay," he said hesitatingly, "you are being honest with
me?"</p>

<p>"I swear by all that's holy I am telling you the plain truth,
and the full truth. Newhover may have done anything you jolly
well like in the War. That's all washed out. I'm after him to get
a line on a foul business which is English in origin. I want to
put a spoke in the wheel of English criminals, and to save
innocent lives. Besides, Newhover is only a subordinate. I don't
propose to raise a hand against him, only to find out what he is
doing."</p>

<p>He held out his hand. "I believe you," he said, "and if I can
I will help you."</p>

<p>He conducted me through the long street of the village, past
the inn, where I supposed Newhover was now going to bed, and out
on to the road which ran up the Skarso valley. We came in sight
of the river, a mighty current full of melted snow, sweeping in
noble curves through the meadowland in that uncanny dusk. It
appeared that he lodged with Peter Bojer, who had a spare bed,
and when we reached the cottage, which stood a hundred yards from
the highway on the very brink of the stream, Peter was willing to
let me have it. His wife gave us supper--an omelette, smoked
salmon, and some excellent Norwegian beer--and after it I got out
my map and had a survey of the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>Gaudian gave me a grisly picture of the condition of his own
country. It seemed that the downfall of the old r&eacute;gime had
carried with it the decent wise men like himself, who had opposed
its follies, but had lined up with it on patriotic grounds when
the War began. He said that Germany was no place for a moderate
man, and that the power lay with the bloated industrials, who
were piling up fortunes abroad while they were wrecking their
country at home. The only opposition, he said, came from the
communists, who were half-witted, and the monarchists, who wanted
the impossible. "Reason is not listened to, and I fear there is
no salvation till my poor people have passed through the last
extremity. You foreign Powers have hastened our destruction, when
you had it in your hands to save us. I think you have meant well,
but you have been blind, for you have not supported our moderate
men and have by your harshness played the game of the wreckers
among us."</p>

<p>It appeared that he was very poor now, like all the
professional classes. I thought it odd that this man, who had a
world-wide reputation as an engineer, couldn't earn a big income
in any country he chose. Then I saw that it was because he had
lost the wish to make money. He had seen too deep into the vanity
of human wishes to have any ambition left. He was unmarried, with
no near relations, and he found his pleasure in living simply in
remote country places and watching flowers and beasts. He was a
keen fisherman, but couldn't afford a good beat, so he leased a
few hundred yards from a farmer, who had not enough water to get
a proper rent for it, and he did a lot of trout fishing in the
tarns high up in the hills and in the Skarso above the foss. As
he sat facing me beyond the stove, with his kind sad brown eyes
and his rugged face, I thought how like he was to a Scottish
moorland shepherd. I had liked him when I first saw him in
Stumm's company, but now I liked him so much that because of him
I was prepared to think better of the whole German race.</p>

<p>I asked him if he had heard of any other Englishman in the
valley--anyone of the name of Jason, for instance. He said no; he
had been there for three weeks, but the fishing did not begin for
another fortnight, and foreign visitors had not yet arrived. Then
I asked him about the <i>saeter</i> farms, and he said that few
of these were open yet, since the high pastures were not ready.
One or two on the lower altitudes might be already inhabited, but
not many, though the winter had been a mild one and the spring
had come early. "Look at the Skarso," he said. "Usually in April
it is quite low, for the snowfields have not begun to melt. But
to-day it is as brimming as if it were the middle of May."</p>

<p>He went over the map with me--an inch-to-a-mile one I had got
in London--and showed me the lie of the land. The <i>saeters</i>
were mostly farther up the river, reached by paths up the
tributary glens. There was a good road running the length of the
valley, but no side roads to connect with the parallel glens, the
Uradal and the Bremendal. I found indeed one track marked on the
map, which led to the Uradal by a place called Snaasen. "Yes,"
said Gaudian, "that is the only thing in the way of what you
soldiers would call lateral communications. I've walked it, and
I'm sorry for the man who tries the road in bad weather. You can
see the beginning of the track from this house; it climbs up
beside the torrent just across the valley. Snaasen is more or
less inhabited all the year round, and I suppose you would call
it a kind of <i>saeter.</i> It is a sort of shelter hut for
travellers taking that road, and in summer it is a paradise for
flowers. You would be surprised at the way the natives can cross
the hills even in winter. Snaasen belongs to the big farm two
miles upstream, which carries with it the best beat on the
Skarso. Also there is said to be first-class ryper-shooting later
in the year, and an occasional bear. By the way, I rather fancy
someone told me that the whole thing was owned by, or had been
leased to, an Englishman. . . . You are rich, you see, and you do
not leave much in Norway for poor people."</p>

<p>I slept like a log on a bed quite as hard as a log, and woke
to a brilliant blue morning, with the birds in the pine-woods
fairly riotous, and snipe drumming in the boggy meadows, and the
Skarso coming down like a sea. I could see the water almost up to
the pathway of a long wooden bridge that led to the big farm
Gaudian had spoken of. I got my glass on the torrent opposite,
and saw the track to Snaasen winding up beside it till it was
lost in a fold of the ravine. Above it I scanned the crown of the
ridge, which was there much lower than on the sides of the fjord.
There was no snow to be seen, and I knew by a sort of instinct
that if I got up there I should find a broad tableland of
squelching pastures with old snowdrifts in the hollows and tracts
of scrubby dwarf birch.</p>

<p>While I was waiting for breakfast I heard a noise from the
high-road, and saw a couple of the little conveyances they call
<i>stolkjaeres</i> passing. My glass showed me Dr. Newhover in
the first and a quantity of luggage in the second. They took the
road across the wooden bridge to the big farm, and I could see
the splash of their wheels at the far end of it, where the river
was over the road. So Dr. Newhover, or some friend of his, was
the lessee of this famous fishing, which carried with it the
shooting on the uplands behind it. I rather thought I should
spend the day finding out more about Snaasen, and I counted
myself lucky to have got quarters in such an excellent
observation-post as Peter Bojer's cottage.</p>

<p>I wouldn't go near the track to Snaasen till I saw what
Newhover did, so Gaudian and I sat patiently at Peter Bojer's
window. About ten o'clock a couple of ponies laden with kit in
charge of a tow-headed boy appeared at the foot of the track and
slowly climbed up the ravine. An hour later came Dr. Newhover, in
a suit that looked like khaki and wearing a long mackintosh cape.
He strode out well and breasted the steep path like a
mountaineer. I wanted to go off myself in pursuit of him, keeping
well behind, but Gaudian very sensibly pointed out how sparse the
cover was, and that if he saw a man on that lonely road he would
certainly want to know all about him.</p>

<p>We sat out-of-doors after luncheon in a pleasant glare of sun,
and by and by were rewarded by the sight of the pack-ponies
returning, laden with a different size and shape of kit. They did
not stop at the big farm, but crossed the wooden bridge and took
the high-road for Merdal. I concluded that this was the baggage
of the man whom Newhover had replaced, and that he was returning
to Stavanger in Kristian Egge's boat. About tea-time the man
himself appeared--Jason, or whatever his name was. I saw two
figures come down the ravine by the Snaasen road, and stop at the
foot and exchange farewells. One of them turned to go back, and I
saw that this was Newhover, climbing with great strides like a
man accustomed to hills. The other crossed the bridge, and passed
within hail of us--a foppish young man, my glass told me, wearing
smart riding-breeches and with an aquascutum slung over his
shoulder.</p>

<p>I was very satisfied with what I had learned. I had seen
Newhover relieve his predecessor, just as Medina had planned, and
I knew where he was lodged. Whatever his secret was it was hidden
in Snaasen, and to Snaasen I would presently go. Gaudian advised
me to wait till after supper, when there would be light enough to
find the way and not too much to betray us. So we both lay down
and slept for four hours, and took the road about ten-thirty as
fresh as yearlings.</p>

<p>It was a noble night, windless and mild, and, though darkness
lurked in the thickets and folds of hill, the sky was filled with
a translucent amethyst glow. I felt as if I were out on some
sporting expedition and enjoyed every moment of the walk with
that strung-up expectant enjoyment which one gets in any form of
chase. The torrent made wild music on our left hand, grumbling in
pits and shooting over ledges with a sound like a snowslip. There
was every kind of bird about, but I had to guess at them by their
sounds and size, for there was no colour in that shadowy
world.</p>

<p>By and by we reached the top and had a light cold wind in our
faces blowing from the snowy mountains to the north. The place
seemed a huge broken tableland and every hollow glistened as if
filled with snow or water. There were big dark shapes ahead of us
which I took to be the hills beyond the Uradal. Here it was not
so easy to follow the track, which twined about in order to avoid
the boggy patches, and Gaudian and I frequently strayed from it
and took tosses over snags of juniper. Once I was up against an
iron pole, and to my surprise saw wires above. Gaudian nodded.
"Snaasen is on the telephone," he said.</p>

<p>I had hoped to see some light in the house, so as to tell it
from a distance. But we did not realise its presence till we were
close upon it, standing a little back from the path, as dark as a
tombstone. The inhabitants must have gone early to bed, for there
was no sign of life within. It was a two-storeyed erection of
wood, stoutly built, with broad eaves to the roof. Adjacent
there stood a big barn or hayshed, and behind it some other
outbuildings which might have been byres or dairies. We walked
stealthily round the place, and were amazed at its utter
stillness. There was no sound of an animal moving in the
steading, and when a brace of mallards flew overhead we started
at the noise like burglars at the creaking of a board.</p>

<p>Short of burglary there was nothing further to be done, so we
took the road home and scrambled at a great pace down the ravine,
for it was chilly on the tableland. Before we went to bed, we had
settled that next day Gaudian should go up to Snaasen like an
ordinary tourist and make some excuse to get inside, while I
would take a long tramp over the plateau, keeping well away from
the house in case there might be something ado in that barren
region.</p>

<p>Next morning saw the same cloudless weather, and we started
off about ten o'clock. I had a glorious but perfectly futile day.
I went up the Skarso to well above the foss, and then climbed the
north wall of the valley by a gulley choked with brushwood, which
gave out long before the top and left me to finish my ascent by
way of some very loose screes and unpleasant boiler-plates. I
reached the plateau much farther to the east, where it was at a
greater altitude, so that I looked down upon the depression where
ran the track to Uradal. I struck due north among boggy meadows
and the remains of old snowdrifts, through whose fringes flowers
were showing, till I was almost on the edge of Uradal, and looked
away beyond it to a fine cluster of rock peaks streaked and
patched with ice. The Uradal glen was so deep cut that I could
not see into it, so I moved west and struck the Merdal track well
to the north of Snaasen. After that I fetched a circuit behind
Snaasen, and had a good view of the house from the distance of
about half a mile. Two of its chimneys were smoking, and there
were sounds of farm work from the yard. There was no sign of live
stock, but it looked as if someone was repairing the sheds
against the summer season. I waited for more than an hour, but I
saw no human being, so I turned homeward, and made a careful
descent by the ravine, reconnoitring every corner in case I
should run into Newhover.</p>

<p>I found that Gaudian had returned before me. When I asked him
what luck he had had he shook his head.</p>

<p>"I played the part of a weary traveller, and asked for milk.
An ugly woman gave me beer. She said she had no milk, till the
cattle came up from the valleys. She would not talk and she was
deaf. She said an English Herr had the ryper shooting, but lived
at Tryssil. That is the name of the big farm by the Skarso. She
would tell me no more, and I saw no other person. But I observed
that Snaasen is larger than I thought. There are rooms built out
at the back, which we thought were barns. There is ample space
there for a man to be concealed."</p>

<p>I asked him if he had any plan, and he said he thought of
going boldly up next day and asking for Newhover, whom he could
say he had seen passing Peter Bojer's cottage. He disliked the
man, but had never openly quarrelled with him. I approved of
that, but in the meantime I resolved to do something on my own
account that night. I was getting anxious, for I felt that my
time was growing desperately short; it was now the 25th of April
and I was due back in London on the 29th, and, if I failed to
turn up, Medina would make inquiries at Fosse Manor and suspect.
I had made up my mind to go alone that night to Snaasen and do a
little pacific burgling.</p>

<p>I set out about eleven, and I put my pistol in my pocket, as
well as my flask and sandwiches and electric torch, for it
occurred to me that anything might happen. I made good going
across the bridge and up the first part of the track, for I
wanted to have as much time as possible for my job. My haste was
nearly my undoing, for instead of reconnoitring and keeping my
ears open, I strode up the hill as if I had been walking to make
a record. It was by the mercy of Heaven that I was at a point
where an outjutting boulder made a sharp corner when I was
suddenly aware that someone was coming down the road. I flattened
myself into the shadow, and saw Newhover.</p>

<p>He did not see or hear me, for he, too, was preoccupied. He
was descending at a good pace, and he must have started in a
hurry, for he had no hat. His longish blond locks were all
tousled, and his face seemed sharper than usual with anxiety.</p>

<p>I wondered what on earth had happened, and my first notion was
to follow him downhill. And then it occurred to me that his
absence gave me a sovereign chance at Snaasen. But if the
household was astir there might be other travellers on the road
and it behoved me to go warily. Now, near the top of the ravine,
just under the edge of the tableland, there was a considerable
patch of wood--birches, juniper, and wind-blown pines--for there
the torrent flowed in a kind of cup, after tumbling off the
plateau and before hurling itself down to the valley. Here it was
possible to find an alternative road to the path, so I dived in
among the matted whortleberries and moss-covered boulders.</p>

<p>I had not gone ten yards before I realised that there was
somebody or something else in the thicket. There was a sound of
plunging ahead of me, then the crack of a rotten log, then the
noise of a falling stone. It might be a beast, but it struck me
that no wild thing would move so awkwardly. Only human boots make
that kind of clumsy slipping.</p>

<p>If this was somebody from Snaasen, what was he doing off the
track? Could he be watching me? Well, I proposed to do a little
stalking on my own account. I got down on all-fours and crawled
in cover in the direction of the sound. It was very dark there,
but I could see a faint light where the scrub thinned round the
stream.</p>

<p>Soon I was at the edge of the yeasty water. The sounds had
stopped, but suddenly they began again a little farther up, and
there was a scuffle as if part of the bank had given way. The
man, whoever he was, seemed to be trying to cross. That would be
a dangerous thing to do, for the torrent was wide and very
strong. I crawled a yard or two up-stream, and then in an open
patch saw what was happening.</p>

<p>A fallen pine made a crazy bridge to a great rock, from which
the rest of the current might conceivably be leaped. A man was
kneeling on the trunk and beginning to move along it. . . . But
as I looked the rotten thing gave way and the next I saw he was
struggling in the foam. It was all the matter of a fraction of a
second, and before I knew I was leaning over the brink and
clutching at an arm. I gripped it, braced one leg against a rock,
and hauled the owner close into the edge out of the main current.
He seemed to have taken no hurt, for he found a foothold, and
scarcely needed my help to scramble up beside me.</p>

<p>Then to my surprise he went for me tooth and nail. It was like
the assault of a wild beast, and its suddenness rolled me on my
back. I felt hands on my throat, and grew angry, caught the
wrists and wrenched them away. I flung a leg over his back and
got uppermost, and after that he was at my mercy. He seemed to
realise it, too, for he lay quite quiet and did not struggle.</p>

<p>"What the devil do you mean?" I said angrily. "You'd have been
drowned but for me, and then you try to throttle me."</p>

<p>I got out my torch and had a look at him. It was the figure of
a slight young man, dressed in rough homespun such as Norwegian
farm lads wear. His face was sallow and pinched, and decorated
with the most preposterous wispish beard, and his hair was cut
roughly as if with garden shears. The eyes that looked up at me
were as scared and wild as a deer's.</p>

<p>"What the devil do you mean?" I repeated, and then to my
surprise he replied in English.</p>

<p>"Let me up," he said, "I'm too tired to fight. I'll go back
with you."</p>

<p>Light broke in on me.</p>

<p>"Don't you worry, old chap," I said soothingly. "You're going
back with me, but not to that infernal <i>saeter.</i> We've met
before, you know. You're Lord Mercot, and I saw you ride 'Red
Prince' last year at the 'House' Grind."</p>

<p>He was sitting up, staring at me like a ghost.</p>

<p>"Who are you? Oh, for God's sake, who are you?"</p>

<p>"Hannay's my name. I live at Fosse Manor in the Cotswolds. You
once came to dine with us before the Heythrop Ball."</p>

<p>"Hannay!" He repeated stumblingly--"I remember--I
think--remember--remember Lady Hannay. Yes--and Fosse. It's on
the road between--"</p>

<p>He scrambled to his feet.</p>

<p>"Oh, sir, get me away. He's after me--the new devil with the
long face, the man who first brought me here. I don't know what
has happened to me, but I've been mad a long time, and I've only
got sane in the last days. Then I remembered--and I ran away. But
they're after me. Oh, quick, quick! Let's hide."</p>

<p>"See here, my lad," I said, and I took out my pistol. "The
first man that lays a hand on you I shoot, and I don't miss.
You're as safe now as if you were at home. But this is no place
to talk, and I've the devil of a lot to tell you. I'm going to
take you down with me to my lodging in the valley. But they're
hunting you, so we've got to go cannily. Are you fit to walk?
Well, do exactly as I tell you, and in an hour you'll be having a
long drink and looking up time-tables."</p>

<p>I consider that journey back a creditable piece of piloting.
The poor boy was underfed and shaking with excitement, but he
stepped out gallantly, and obeyed me like a lamb. We kept off the
track so as to muffle our steps in grass, and took every corner
like scouts in a reconnaissance. We met Newhover coming back, but
we heard him a long way off and were in good cover when he
passed. He was hurrying as furiously as ever and I could hear his
laboured breathing. After that we had a safe road over the
meadow, but we crossed the bridge most circumspectly, making sure
that there was no one in the landscape. About half-past one I
pushed open Gaudian's bedroom window, woke him, and begged him to
forage for food and drink.</p>

<p>"Did you get into Snaasen?" he asked sleepily.</p>

<p>"No, but I've found what we've been looking for. One of the
three hostages is at this moment sitting on your cabin-box."</p>

<h1><a name="c12">CHAPTER XII</a></h1>

<h1>I RETURN TO SERVITUDE</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>We fed Mercot with tinned meats and biscuits and bottled beer,
and he ate like a famished schoolboy. The odd thing was that his
terror had suddenly left him. I suppose the sight of me, which
had linked him up definitely with his past, had made him feel a
waif no more, and, once he was quite certain who he was, his
natural courage returned. He got great comfort from looking at
Gaudian, and indeed I could not imagine a better sedative than a
sight of that kind, wise old face. I lent him pyjamas, rubbed him
down to prevent a chill from his ducking, put him in my bed, and
had the satisfaction of seeing him slip off at once into deep
slumber.</p>

<p>Next morning Gaudian and I interviewed Peter Bojer and
explained that a young English friend of ours had had an
accident, while on a walking tour, and might be with us for a day
or two. It was not likely that Newhover would advertise his loss,
and in any case Peter was no gossip, and Gaudian, who had known
him for years, let him see that we wanted the fact of a guest
being with us kept as quiet as possible. The boy slept till
nearly midday, while I kept a watch on the road. Newhover
appeared early, and went down to Merdal village, where he spent
the better part of the forenoon. He was probably making
inquiries, but they were bound in his own interest to be discreet
ones. Then he returned to Tryssil, and later I saw a dejected
figure tramping up the Snaasen track. He may have thought that
the body of the fugitive was in some pool of the torrent or being
swirled down by the Skarso to the sea, and I imagined that that
scarcely fitted in with his instructions.</p>

<p>When Mercot awoke at last and had his breakfast he looked a
different lad. His eyes had lost their fright, and though he
stuttered badly and seemed to have some trouble in collecting his
wits, he had obviously taken hold of himself. His great desire
was to get clean, and that took some doing, for he could not have
had a bath for weeks. Then he wanted to borrow my razor and shave
his beard, but I managed to prevent him in time, for I had been
thinking the thing out, and I saw that that would never do. So
far as I could see, he had recovered his memory, but there were
still gaps in it; that is to say, he remembered all his past
perfectly well till he left Oxford on February 17th, and he
remembered the events of the last few days, but between the two
points he was still hazy.</p>

<p>On returning to his rooms that February evening he had found a
note about a horse he was trying to buy, an urgent note asking
him to come round at once to certain stables. He had just time
for this, before dressing for dinner, so he dashed out of the
house--meeting nobody, as it chanced, on the stairs, and, as the
night was foggy, being seen by no one in the streets. After that
his memory was a blank. He had wakened in a room in London, which
he thought was a nursing home, and had seen a doctor--I could
picture that doctor--and had gone to sleep again. After that his
recollection was like a black night studded with little points of
light which were physical sensations. He remembered being very
cold and sometimes very tired, he recollected the smell of
paraffin, and of mouldy hay, and of a treacly drink which made
him sick. He remembered faces, too, a cross old woman who cursed
him, a man who seemed to be always laughing, and whose laugh he
feared more than curses. . . .</p>

<p>I suppose that Medina's spell must have been wearing thin
during these last days, and that the keeper, Jason, or whoever he
was, could not revive it. For Mercot had begun to see Jason no
longer as a terror but as an offence--an underbred young bounder
whom he detested. And with this clearing of the foreground came a
lightening of the background. He saw pictures of his life at
Alcester, at first as purely objective things, but soon as in
some way connected with himself. Then longing started, passionate
longing for something which he knew was his own. . . . It was a
short step from that to the realisation that he was Lord Mercot,
though he happened to be clad like a tramp and was as dirty as a
stoker. And then he proceeded to certain halting deductions.
Something bad had happened to him: he was in a foreign
land--which land he didn't know: he was being ill-treated and
kept prisoner; he must escape and get back to his old happy
world. He thought of escape quite blindly, without any plan; if
only he could get away from that accursed <i>saeter,</i> he would
remember better, things would happen to him, things would come
back to him.</p>

<p>Then Jason went and Newhover came, and Newhover drove him half
crazy with fear, for the doctor's face was in some extraordinary
way mixed up with his confused memory of the gaps between the old
world and the new. He was mad to escape now, but rather to escape
from Newhover than to reach anywhere. He watched for his chance,
and found it about eight o'clock the evening before, when the
others in the house were at supper. Some instinct had led him
towards Merdal. He had heard footsteps behind him and had taken
to the thicket. . . . I appeared, an enemy as he thought, and he
had despairingly flung himself on me. Then I had spoken his name,
and that fixed the wavering panorama of his memory. He "came to
himself" literally, and was now once more the undergraduate of
Christ Church, rather shell-shocked and jumpy, but quite
sane.</p>

<p>The question which worried me was whether the cure was
complete, whether Newhover could act as Medina's deputy and
resurrect the spell. I did not believe that he could, but I
wasn't certain. Anyhow it had to be risked.</p>

<p>Mercot repeated his request for the loan of my razor. He was
smoking a Turkish cigarette as if every whiff took him nearer
Elysium. Badly shorn, ill-clad, and bearded as he was, he had
still the ghost of the air of the well-to-do, sporting young men.
He wanted to know when the steamer sailed, but there seemed no
panic now in his impatience.</p>

<p>"Look here," I said. "I don't think you can start just yet.
There's a lot I want to tell you now you're able to hear it."</p>

<p>I gave him a rough summary of Macgillivray's story, and the
tale of the three hostages. I think he found it comforting to
know that there were others in the same hole as himself. "By
Jove!" he said, "what a damnable business! And I'm the only one
you've got on the track of. No word of the girl and the little
boy?"</p>

<p>"No word!"</p>

<p>"Poor devils," he said, but I do not think he really took in
the situation.</p>

<p>"So you see how we are placed. Macgillivray's round-up is
fixed for the 10th of June. We daren't release the hostages till
the 9th, for otherwise the gang would suspect. They have
everything ready, as I've told you, for their own liquidation.
Also we can't release one without the others, unless by the 9th
of June we have given up hope of the others. Do you see what I
mean?"</p>

<p>He didn't. "All I want is to get home in double-quick time,"
he said.</p>

<p>"I don't wonder. But you must see that that is impossible,
unless we chuck in our hand."</p>

<p>He stared at me, and I saw fright beginning to return to his
eyes.</p>

<p>"Do you mean that you want me to go back to that bloody
place?"</p>

<p>"That's what I mean. If you think it out, you'll see it's the
only way. We must do nothing to spoil the chances of the other
two. You're a gentleman, and are bound to play the game."</p>

<p>"But I can't," he cried. "Oh, my God, you can't ask me to."
There were tears in his voice, and his eyes were wild.</p>

<p>"It's a good deal to ask, but I know you will do it. There's
not a scrap of danger now, for you have got back your memory, and
you know where you are. It's up to you to play a game with your
gaoler. He is the dupe now. You fill the part of the half-witted
farm-boy and laugh at him all the time in your sleeve. Herr
Gaudian will be waiting down here to keep an eye on you, and when
the time is ripe--and it won't be more than five weeks--I give
you full permission to do anything you like with Dr.
Newhover."</p>

<p>"I can't, I can't," he wailed, and his jaw dropped like a
scared child's.</p>

<p>Then Gaudian spoke. "I think we had better leave the subject
for the present. Lord Mercot will do precisely what he thinks
right. You have sprung the thing on him too suddenly. I think it
might be a good plan if you went for a walk, Hannay. Try the
south side of the foss--there's some very pretty scrambling to be
had there."</p>

<p>He spoke to me at the door. "The poor boy is all in pieces.
You cannot ask him for a difficult decision when his nerves are
still raw. Will you leave him with me? I have had some experience
in dealing with such cases."</p>

<p>When I got back for supper, after a climb which exercised
every muscle in my body, I found Gaudian teaching Mercot a new
patience game. We spent a very pleasant evening, and I noticed
that Gaudian led the talk to matters in which the boy could
share, and made him speak of himself. We heard about his racing
ambitions, his desire to ride in the Grand National, his hopes
for his polo game. It appeared that he was destined for the
Guards, but he was to be allowed a year's travel when he left the
'Varsity, and we planned out an itinerary for him. Gaudian, who
had been almost everywhere in the world, told him of places in
Asia where no tourist had ever been and where incredible sport
was to be had in virgin forest, and I pitched him some yarns
about those few districts of Africa which are still unspoiled. He
got very keen, for he had a bit of the explorer in him, and asked
modestly if we thought he could pull off certain plans we had
suggested. We told him there was no doubt about it. "It's not as
tough a proposition as riding in the National," I said.</p>

<p>When we had put him to bed, Gaudian smiled as if well pleased.
"He has begun to get back his confidence," he said.</p>

<p>He slept for twelve hours, and when he woke I had gone out,
for I thought it better to leave him in Gaudian's hands. I had to
settle the business that day, for it was now the 27th. I walked
down the fjord to Hauge, and told Johan to be ready to start next
morning. I asked him about the weather, which was still
cloudless, and he stared at the sky and sniffed, and thought it
would hold for a day or two. "But rain is coming," he added, "and
wind. The noise of the foss is too loud."</p>

<p>When I returned Gaudian met me at the door. "The boy has
recovered," he said. "He will speak to you himself. He is a brave
boy and will do a hard task well."</p>

<p>It was a rather shy and self-conscious Mercot that greeted
me.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I behaved rather badly yesterday, sir. I was
feeling a bit rattled, and I'm ashamed of myself, for I've always
rather fancied my nerve."</p>

<p>"My dear chap," I said, "you've been through enough to crack
the nerve of a buffalo."</p>

<p>"I want to say that of course I'll do what you want. I must
play the game by the others. That poor little boy! And I remember
Miss Victor quite well--I once stayed in the same house with her.
I'll go back to the <i>saeter</i> when you give the word. Indeed,
I'm rather looking forward to it. I promise to play the half-wit
so that Dr. Newhover will think me safe in the bag. All I ask is
that you let me have my innings with him when the time comes.
I've a biggish score to settle."</p>

<p>"Indeed I promise that. Look here, Mercot, if you don't mind
my saying it, I think you're behaving uncommonly well. You're a
gallant fellow."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's all right," he said, blushing. "When do you want
me to start? If it's possible, I'd like another night in a decent
bed."</p>

<p>"You shall have it. Early to-morrow morning we'll accompany
you to the prison door. You've got to gibber when you see
Newhover, and pretend not to be able to give any account of your
doings. I leave you to put up a camouflage. The next five weeks
will be infernally dull for you, but you must just shut your
teeth and stick it out. Remember, Gaudian will be down here all
the time and in touch with your friends, and when the day comes
you will take your instructions from him. And, by the way, I'm
going to leave you my pistol. I suppose you can keep it
concealed, for Newhover is not likely to search your pockets.
Don't use it, of course, but it may be a comfort to you to know
that you have it."</p>

<p>He took it gladly. "Don't be afraid I'll use it. What I'm
keeping for Newhover is the best hiding man ever had. He's a bit
above my weight, but I don't mind that."</p>

<p>Very early next morning we woke Mercot, and, while the sky was
turning from sapphire to turquoise, took our way through the hazy
meadows and up the Snaasen track. We left it at the summit, and
fetched a circuit round by the back of the <i>saeter,</i> but
first we made Mercot roll in the thicket till he had a very
grubby face and plenty of twigs and dust in his untidy hair. Then
the two of us shook hands with him, found a lair in a patch of
juniper, and watched him go forward.</p>

<p>A forlorn figure he looked in that cold half-light as he
approached the <i>saeter</i> door. But he was acting his part
splendidly, for he stumbled with fatigue, dropped heavily against
the door, and beat on it feebly. It seemed a long time till it
opened, and then he appeared to shrink back in terror. The old
woman cried out shrilly to summon someone from within, and
presently Newhover came out in a dressing-gown. He caught Mercot
by the shoulder and shook him, and that valiant soul behaved
exactly like a lunatic, shielding his head and squealing like a
rabbit. Finally we saw him dragged indoors. . . . It was horrible
to leave him like that, but I comforted myself with the thought
of what Newhover would be like in five weeks' time.</p>

<p>We raced back to Peter Bojer's and after a hasty breakfast
started off for Hauge. I settled with Gaudian that he was to
report any developments to me by cable, and I was to do the same
to him. When the day of release was fixed, he was to go boldly up
to Snaasen and deal with the doctor as he liked, making sure that
he could not communicate with Medina for a day or two. A
motor-launch would be waiting at Merdal to take the two to
Stavanger, for I wanted him to see Mercot on board the English
steamer. I arranged, too, that he should be supplied with
adequate funds, for Mercot had not a penny.</p>

<p>We pushed off at once, for I had to be at Flacksholm in good
time, and as the morning advanced I did not feel so sure of the
weather. What wind we had had these last days had been mild
breezes from the west, but now it seemed to be shifting more to
the north, and increasing in vehemence. Down in that deep-cut
fjord it was calm enough, but up on the crest of the tableland on
the northern shore I could see that it was blowing hard, for my
glass showed me little <i>tourmentes</i> of snow. Also it had
suddenly got much colder. I made Johan force the pace, and early
in the afternoon we were out of the shelter of the rock walls in
the inlet into which the fjord broadened. Here it was blowing
fairly hard, and there was a stiff sea running. Flying squalls of
rain beat down on us from the north, and for five minutes or so
would shut out the view. It was a regular gusty April day, such
as you find in spring salmon-fishing in Scotland, and had my job
been merely to catch the boat at Stavanger I should not have
minded it at all. But there was no time for the boat, for in
little more than twenty-four hours I had to meet Medina. I
wondered if Archie Roylance had turned up. I wondered still more
how an aeroplane was to make the return journey over these stormy
leagues of sea.</p>

<p>Presently the low green lines of Flacksholm showed through the
spray, and when Johan began to shape his course to the south-west
for Stavanger, I bade him go straight forward and land me on the
island. I told him I had a friend who was camping there, and that
we were to be picked up in a day or two by an English yacht.
Johan obviously thought me mad, but he did as he was told. "There
will be no one on the island yet," he said. "The farmer from
Rosmaer does not come till June, when the haymaking begins. The
winter pasture is poor and sour." That was all to the good, for I
did not want any spectator of our madness.</p>

<p>As we drew nearer I could see no sign of life on the low
shore, except an infinity of eider-ducks, and a fine osprey which
sat on a pointed rock like a heraldic griffin. I was watching the
bird, for I had only seen an osprey twice before, when Johan
steered me into a creek, where there was deep water alongside a
flat reef. This, he told me, was the ordinary landing-place from
the mainland. I flung my suit-case and rucksack on shore, said
good-bye to Johan and tipped him well, and watched the little
boat ploughing south till it was hidden by a squall. Then,
feeling every kind of a fool, I seized my baggage and proceeded,
like Robinson Crusoe, into the interior.</p>

<p>It was raining steadily, a fine thin rain, and every now and
then a squall would burst on me and ruffle the sea. Jolly weather
for flying, I reflected, especially for flying over some hundreds
of miles of ocean! . . . I found the farm, a few rough wooden
buildings and a thing like a stone cattle-pen, but there was no
sign of human life there. Then I got out my map, and concluded
that I had better make for the centre of the island, where there
seemed to be some flat ground at one end of the loch. I was
feeling utterly depressed, walking like a bagman with my kit in
my hand in an uninhabited Norwegian isle, and due in London the
next evening. London seemed about as inaccessible in the time as
the moon.</p>

<p>When I got to the rim of the central hollow there was a brief
clearing of the weather, and I looked down on a little grey tarn
set in very green meadows. In the meadows at the north end I saw
to my joy what looked like an aeroplane picketed down, and a
thing like a small tent near it. Also I could see smoke curling
up from a group of boulders adjoining. The gallant Archie had
arrived, and my spirits lightened. I made good going down the
hill, and, as I shouted, a figure like an Arctic explorer crawled
out of the tent.</p>

<p>"Hullo, Dick," it cried. "Any luck?"</p>

<p>"Plenty," I said. "And you?"</p>

<p>"Famous. Got here last night after a clinkin' journey with the
bus behavin' like a lamb. Had an interestin' evenin' with the
birds--Lord! such a happy huntin'-ground for 'em. I've been doin'
sentry-go on the tops all mornin' lookin' for you, but the
weather got dirty, so I returned to the wigwam. Lunch is nearly
ready."</p>

<p>"What about the weather?" I asked anxiously.</p>

<p><i>"Pas si b&ecirc;te,"</i> he said, sniffing. "The wind is
pretty sure to go down at sunset. D'you mind a night
journey?"</p>

<p>Archie's imperturbable good humour cheered me enormously. I
must say he was a born campaigner, for he had made himself very
snug, and gave me as good a meal as I have ever eaten--a hot stew
of tinned stuff and curry, a plum-pudding, and an assortment of
what he called <i>"delicatessen."</i> To keep out the cold we
drank benedictine in horn mugs. He could talk about nothing but
his blessed birds, and announced that he meant to come back to
Flacksholm and camp for a week. He had seen a special
variety--some kind of phalarope--that fairly ravished his heart.
When I asked questions about the journey ahead of us, he scarcely
deigned to answer, so busy he was with speculation on the
feathered fauna of Norway.</p>

<p>"Archie," I said, "are you sure you can get me across the
North Sea?"</p>

<p>"I won't say 'sure.' There's always a lottery in this game,
but with any luck we ought to manage it. The wind will die down,
and besides it's a ground wind, and may be quiet enough a few
hundred feet up. We'll have to shape a compass course anyhow, so
that darkness won't worry us."</p>

<p>"What about the machine?" I asked. I don't know why, but I
felt horribly nervous.</p>

<p>"A beauty. But of course you never know. If we were driven
much out of a straight course, our petrol might run short."</p>

<p>"What would that mean?"</p>

<p>"Forced landin'."</p>

<p>"But supposing we hadn't reached land?"</p>

<p>"Oh, then we'd be for it," said Archie cheerfully. He added,
as if to console me: "We might be picked up by a passin' steamer
or a fishin' smack. I've known fellows that had that luck."</p>

<p>"What are the chances of our getting over safely?"</p>

<p>"Evens. Never better or worse than evens in this flyin'
business. But it will be all right. Dash it all, a woodcock makes
the trip constantly in one flight."</p>

<p>After that I asked no more questions, for I knew I could not
get him past the woodcock. I was not feeling happy, but Archie's
calm put me to shame. We had a very good tea, and then, sure
enough, the wind began to die down, and the clouds opened to show
clear sky. It grew perishing cold, and I was glad of every stitch
of clothing, and envied Archie his heavy skin coat. We were all
ready about nine, and in a dead calm cast loose, taxied over a
stretch of turf, rose above the loch so as to clear the hill, and
turned our faces to the west, which was like a shell of gold
closing down upon the molten gold of the sea.</p>

<p>Luck was with us that night, and all my qualms were belied.
Apart from the cold, which was savage, I enjoyed every moment of
the trip, till in the early dawn we saw a crawling black line
beneath us which was the coast of Aberdeen. We filled up with
petrol at a place in Kincardine, and had an enormous breakfast at
the local hotel. Everything went smoothly and it was still early
in the day when I found we were crossing the Cheviots. We landed
at York about noon, and, while Archie caught the London train, I
got my car from the garage and started for Oxford. But first I
wired to Mary asking her to wire to Medina in my name that I
would reach London by the seven-fifteen. I had a pleasant run
south, left the car at Oxford, and duly emerged on the platform
at Paddington to find Medina waiting for me.</p>

<p>His manner was almost tender.</p>

<p>"My dear fellow, I do hope you are better?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly fit again, thank you. Ready for anything."</p>

<p>"You look more sunburnt than when you left town."</p>

<p>"It's the wonderful weather we've had. I've been lying basking
on the verandah."</p>

<h1>I VISIT THE FIELDS OF EDEN</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>There was a change in Medina. I noticed it the following day
when I lunched with him, and very particularly at the next dinner
of the Thursday Club to which I went as his guest. It was a small
change, which nobody else would have remarked, but to me, who was
watching him like a lynx, it was clear enough. His ease of manner
towards the world was a little less perfect, and when we were
alone he was more silent than before. I did not think that he had
begun to suspect any danger to his plans, but the day for their
consummation was approaching, and even his cold assurance may
have been flawed by little quivers of nervousness. As I saw it,
once the big liquidation took place and he realised the assets
which were to be the foundation of his main career, it mattered
little what became of the hostages. He might let them go; they
would wander back to their old world unable to give any account
of their absence, and, if the story got out, there would be
articles in the medical journals about these unprecedented cases
of lost memory. So far I was certain that they had taken no
lasting harm. But if the liquidation failed, God knew what their
fate would be. They would never be seen again, for if his
possession of them failed to avert disaster to his plans, he
would play for safety, and, above all, for revenge. Revenge to a
mind like his would be a consuming passion.</p>

<p>The fact that I had solved one conundrum and laid my hand on
one of the hostages put me in a perfect fever of restlessness.
Our time was very short, and there were still two poor souls
hidden in his black underworld. It was the little boy I thought
most of, and perhaps my preoccupation with him made me stupid
about other things. My thoughts were always on the Blind Spinner,
and there I could not advance one single inch. Macgillivray's
watchers had nothing to report. It was no use my paying another
visit to Madame Breda, and going through the same rigmarole. I
could only stick to Medina and pray for luck. I had resolved that
if he asked me again to take up my quarters with him in Hill
Street I would accept, though it might be hideously awkward in a
score of ways.</p>

<p>I longed for Sandy, but no word came from him, and I had his
strict injunctions not to try to reach him. The only friend I saw
in those early days of May was Archie Roylance who seemed to have
forgotten his Scotch greenshanks and settled down in London for
the season. He started playing polo, which was not a safe game
for a man with a crocked leg, and he opened his house in
Grosvenor Street and roosted in a corner of it. He knew I was
busy in a big game, and he was mad to be given a share in it, but
I had to be very careful with Archie. He was the best fellow
alive, but discretion had never been his strong point. So I
refused to tell him anything at present, and I warned Turpin, who
was an ancient friend of his, to do the same. The three of us
dined together one night, and poor old Turpin was rallied by
Archie on his glumness.</p>

<p>"You're a doleful bird, you know," he told him. "I heard
somewhere you were goin' to be married and I expect that's the
cause. What do you call it--<i>ranger</i> yourself? Cheer up, my
son. It can't be as bad as it sounds. Look at Dick there."</p>

<p>I switched him on to other subjects, and we got his opinion on
the modern stage. Archie had been doing a course of plays, and
had very strong views on the drama. Something had got to happen,
he said, or he fell asleep in the first act, and something very
rarely happened, so he was left to slumber peacefully till he was
awakened and turned out by the attendants. He liked plays with
shooting in them, and knockabout farce--anything indeed with a
noise in it. But he had struck a vein of serious drama which he
had found soporific. One piece in especial, which showed the
difficulties of a lady of fifty who fell in love with her
stepson, he seriously reprobated.</p>

<p>"Rotten," he complained. "What did it matter to anyone what
the old cat did? But I assure you, everybody round me was
gloatin' over it. A fellow said to me it was a masterpiece of
tragic irony. What's irony, Dick? I thought it was the tone your
commandin' officer adopted, when you had made an ass of yourself,
and he showed it by complimentin' you on your intelligence. . . .
Oh, by the way, you remember the girl in green we saw at that
dancin' place? Well, I saw her at the show--at least I'm pretty
sure it was her--in a box with the black-bearded fellow. She
didn't seem to be takin' much of it in. Wonder who she is and
what she was doin' there? Russian, d'you think? I believe the
silly play was translated from the Russian. I want to see that
girl dance again."</p>

<p>The next week was absolutely blank, except for my own
perpetual worrying. Medina kept me close to him, and I had to
relinquish any idea of going down to Fosse for an occasional
night. I longed badly for the place and for a sight of Peter
John, and Mary's letters didn't comfort me, for they were getting
scrappier and scrappier. My hope was that Medina would act on
Khar&aacute;ma's advice, and in order to establish his power over
his victims bring them into the open and exercise it in the
environment to which they had been accustomed. That wouldn't help
me with the little boy, but it might give me a line on Miss
Victor. I rather hoped that at some ball I would see him
insisting on some strange woman dancing with him, or telling her
to go home, or something, and then I would have cause to suspect.
But no such luck. He never spoke to a woman in my presence who
wasn't somebody perfectly well known. I began to think that he
had rejected the Indian's advice as too dangerous.</p>

<p>Khar&aacute;ma, more by token, was back in town, and Medina
took me to see him again. The fellow had left Claridge's and was
living in a little house in Eaton Place, and away from the
glitter of a big hotel he looked even more sinister and damnable.
We went there one evening after dinner, and found him squatting
on the usual couch in a room lit by one lamp and fairly stinking
with odd scents. He seemed to have shed his occidental dress, for
he wore flowing robes, and I could see his beastly bare feet
under the skirts of them, when he moved to rearrange a
curtain.</p>

<p>They took no more notice of me than if I had been a
grandfather's clock, and to my disgust they conducted the whole
conversation in some Eastern tongue. I gathered nothing from it,
except a deduction as to Medina's state of mind. There was an
unmistakable hint of nervousness in his voice. He seemed to be
asking urgent questions, and the Indian was replying calmly and
soothingly. By and by Medina's voice became quieter, and suddenly
I realised that the two were speaking of me. Khar&aacute;ma's
heavy eyes were raised for a second in my direction, and Medina
turned ever so little towards me. The Indian asked some question
about me, and Medina replied carelessly with a shrug of his
shoulders and a slight laugh. The laugh rasped my temper. He was
evidently saying that I was packed up and sealed and safe on the
shelf.</p>

<p>That visit didn't make me feel happier, and next day, when I
had a holiday from Medina's company, I had nothing better to do
than to wander about London and think dismal thoughts. Yet, as
luck would have it, that aimless walk had its consequences. It
was a Sunday, and on the edge of Battersea Park I encountered a
forlorn little company of Salvationists conducting a service in
the rain. I stopped to listen--I always do--for I am the eternal
average man who is bound to halt at every street show, whether it
be a motor accident or a Punch and Judy. I listened to the
tail-end of an address from a fat man who looked like a reformed
publican, and a few words from an earnest lady in spectacles.
Then they sang a hymn to a trombone accompaniment, and lo and
behold, it was my old friend, which I had last whistled in Tom
Greenslade's bedroom at Fosse. "There is rest for the weary,"
they sang:</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>"On the other side of Jordan,<br>
In the green fields of Eden,<br>
Where the Tree of Life is blooming,<br>
There is rest for you."</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>I joined heartily in the singing, and contributed two
half-crowns to the collecting box, for somehow the thing seemed
to be a good omen.</p>

<p>I had been rather neglecting that item in the puzzle, and that
evening and during the night I kept turning it over till my brain
was nearly addled.</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Where the sower casts his seed in<br>
Furrows of the fields of Eden."</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>That was the version in the rhyme, and in Tom Greenslade's
recollection the equivalent was a curiosity shop in North London
kept by a Jew with a dyed beard. Surely the two must correspond,
though I couldn't just see how. The other two items had panned
out so well that it was reasonable to suppose that the third
might do the same. I could see no light, and I finally dropped
off to sleep with that blessed "fields of Eden" twittering about
my head.</p>

<p>I awoke with the same obsession, but other phrases had added
themselves to it. One was the "playing-fields of Eton," about
which some fellow had said something, and for a moment I wondered
if I hadn't got hold of the right trail. Eton was a school for
which Peter John's name was down, and therefore it had to do with
boys, and might have to do with David Warcliff. But after
breakfast I gave up that line, for it led nowhere. The word was
"Eden," to rhyme with "seed in." There were other fields haunting
me--names like Tothill Fields and Bunhill Fields. These were
places in London, and that was what I wanted. The Directory
showed no name like that of "Fields of Eden," but was it not
possible that there had once in old days been a place called by
that odd title?</p>

<p>I spent the morning in the Club library, which was a very good
one, reading up Old London. I read all about Vauxhall Gardens and
Ranelagh and Cremorne, and a dozen other ancient haunts of
pleasure, but I found nothing to my purpose. Then I remembered
that Bullivant--Lord Artinswell--had had for one of his hobbies
the study of bygone London, so I telephoned to him and invited
myself to lunch.</p>

<p>He was very pleased to see me, and it somehow comforted me to
find myself again in the house in Queen Anne's Gate where I had
spent some of the most critical moments of my life.</p>

<p>"You've taken on the work I wrote to you about," he said. "I
knew you would. How are you getting on?"</p>

<p>"So-so. It's a big job and there's very little time. I want to
ask you a question. You're an authority on Old London. Tell me,
did you ever come across in your researches the name of the
'Fields of Eden'?"</p>

<p>He shook his head. "Not that I remember. What part of
London?"</p>

<p>"I fancy it would be somewhere north of Oxford Street."</p>

<p>He considered. "No. What is your idea? A name of some private
gardens or place of amusement?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Just like Cremorne or Vauxhall."</p>

<p>"I don't think so, but we'll look it up. I've a good
collection of old maps and plans, and some antique
directories."</p>

<p>So after luncheon we repaired to his library and set to work.
The maps showed nothing, nor did the books at first. We were
searching too far back, in the seventeenth and early eighteenth
centuries, when you went fox-hunting in what is now Regent's Park
and Tyburn gallows stood near the Marble Arch. Then, by sheer
luck, I tried a cast nearer our own time, and found a ribald work
belonging to about the date of the American War, which purported
to be a countryman's guide to the amusements of town. There was
all sorts of information about "Cider Cellars" and "Groves of
Harmony," which must have been pretty low pubs, and places in the
suburbs for cock-fighting and dog-fighting. I turned up the
index, and there to my joy I saw the word "Eden."</p>

<p>I read the passage aloud, and I believe my hands were shaking.
The place was, as I hoped, north of Oxford Street in what we now
call Marylebone. "The Fields of Eden," said the book, "were
opened by Mr. Askew as a summer resort for the gentlemen and
sportsmen of the capital. There of a fine afternoon may be seen
Lord A-- and the Duke of B-- roving among the shady, if
miniature, groves, not unaccompanied by the fair nymphs of the
garden, while from adjacent arbours comes the cheerful tinkle of
glasses and the merry clatter of dice, and the harmonious strains
of Signora F--'s Italian choir." There was a good deal more of
it, but I stopped reading. There was a plan of London in the
book, and from it I was able to plot out the boundaries of that
doubtful paradise.</p>

<p>Then I got a modern map, and fixed the location on it. The
place had been quite small, only a few acres, and to-day it was
covered by the block defined by Wellesley Street, Apwith Lane,
Little Fardell Street, and the mews behind Royston Square. I
wrote this down in my note-book and took my leave.</p>

<p>"You look pleased, Dick. Have you found what you want? Curious
that I never heard the name, but it seems to have belonged to the
dullest part of London at the dullest period of its history."
Lord Artinswell, I could see, was a little nettled, for your
antiquary hates to be caught out in his own subject.</p>

<p>I spent the rest of the afternoon making a very thorough
examination of a not very interesting neighbourhood. What I
wanted was a curiosity shop, and at first I thought I was going
to fail. Apwith Lane was a kind of slum, with no shops but a
disreputable foreign chemist's and a small dirty confectioner's,
round the door of which dirty little children played. The
inhabitants seemed to be chiefly foreigners. The mews at the back
of Royston Square were of course useless; it was long since any
dweller in that square had kept a carriage, and they seemed to be
occupied chiefly with the motor vans of a steam laundry and the
lorries of a coal merchant. Wellesley Street, at least the part
of it in my area, was entirely occupied with the show-rooms of
various American automobile companies. Little Fardell Street was
a curious place. It had one odd building which may have been
there when the Fields of Eden flourished, and which now seemed to
be a furniture repository of a sort, with most of the windows
shuttered. The other houses were perhaps forty years old, most of
them the offices of small wholesale businesses, such as you find
in back streets in the City. There was one big French baker's
shop at the corner, a picture-framer's, a watch-maker's and a
small and obviously decaying optician's. I walked down the place
twice, and my heart sank, for I could see nothing in the least
resembling an antique-shop.</p>

<p>I patrolled the street once more, and then I observed that the
old dwelling, which looked like a furniture depository, was also
some kind of shop. Through a dirty lower window I caught a
glimpse of what seemed to be Persian rugs and the bland face of a
soap-stone idol. The door had the air of never having been used,
but I tried it and it opened, tinkling a bell far in the back
premises. I found myself in a small dusty place, littered up like
a lumber room with boxes and carpets and rugs and bric-a-brac.
Most of the things were clearly antiques, though to my inexpert
eye they didn't look worth much. The Turcoman rugs, especially,
were the kind of thing you can buy anywhere in the Levant by the
dozen.</p>

<p>A dishevelled Jewess confronted me, wearing sham diamond
earrings.</p>

<p>"I'm interested in antiques," I said pleasantly, taking off my
hat to her. "May I look round?"</p>

<p>"We do not sell to private customers," she said. "Only to the
trade."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry to hear that. But may I look round? If I fancied
something, I dare say I could get some dealer I know to offer for
it."</p>

<p>She made no answer, but fingered her earrings with her plump
grubby hands.</p>

<p>I turned over some of the rugs and carpets, and my first
impression was confirmed. They were mostly trash, and a lacquer
cabinet I uncovered was a shameless fake.</p>

<p>"I like that," I said, pointing to a piece of Persian
embroidery. "Can't you put a price on it for me?"</p>

<p>"We only sell to the trade," she repeated, as if it were a
litany. Her beady eyes, which never left my face, were entirely
without expression.</p>

<p>"I expect you have a lot of things upstairs," I said. "Do you
think I might have a look at them? I'm only in London for the
day, and I might see something I badly wanted. I quite understand
that you are wholesale people, but I can arrange any purchase
through a dealer. You see, I'm furnishing a country house."</p>

<p>For the first time her face showed a certain life. She shook
her head vigorously. "We have no more stock at present. We do not
keep a large stock. Things come in and go out every day. We only
sell to the trade."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm sorry to have taken up your time. Good afternoon."
As I left the shop, I felt that I had made an important
discovery. The business was bogus. There was very little that any
dealer would touch, and the profits from all the trade done would
not keep the proprietor in Virginian cigarettes.</p>

<p>I paid another visit to the neighbourhood after dinner. The
only sign of life was in the slums of Apwith Lane, where frowsy
women were chattering on the kerb. Wellesley Street was shuttered
and silent from end to end. So was Little Fardell Street. Not a
soul was about in it, not a ray of light was seen at any window,
in the midst of the din of London it made a little enclave like a
graveyard. I stopped at the curiosity shop, and saw that the
windows were heavily shuttered and that the flimsy old door was
secured by a strong outer frame of iron which fitted into a
groove at the edge of the pavement and carried a stout lock. The
shutters on the ground-floor windows were substantial things,
preposterously substantial for so worthless a show. As I looked
at them I had a strong feeling that the house behind that
palisade was not as dead as it looked, that somewhere inside it
there was life, and that in the night things happened there which
it concerned me tremendously to know. Next morning I went to see
Macgillivray. "Can you lend me a first-class burglar?" I asked.
"Only for one night. Some fellow who won't ask any questions and
will hold his tongue."</p>

<p>"I've given up being surprised when you're about," he said.
"No. We don't keep tame burglars here, but I can find you a man
who knows rather more about the art than any professional.
Why?"</p>

<p>"Simply because I want to get inside a certain house to-night,
and I see no chance of doing it except by breaking my way in. I
suppose you could so arrange it that the neighbouring policemen
would not interfere. In fact I want them to help to keep the
coast clear."</p>

<p>I went into details with him, and showed him the lie of the
land. He suggested trying the back of the house, but I had
reconnoitred that side and seen that it was impossible, for the
building seemed to join on with the houses in the street behind.
In fact there was no back door. The whole architecture was
extremely odd, and I had a notion that the entrance in Little
Fardell Street might itself be a back door. I told Macgillivray
that I wanted an expert who could let me in by one of the
ground-floor windows, and replace everything so that there should
be no trace next morning. He rang a bell and asked for Mr. Abel
to be sent for. Mr. Abel was summoned, and presently appeared, a
small wizened man, like a country tradesman. Macgillivray
explained what was required of him, and Mr. Abel nodded. It was a
job which offered no difficulties, he said, to an experienced
man. He would suggest that he investigated the place immediately
after closing time, and began work about ten o'clock. If I
arrived at ten-thirty, he promised to have a means of entrance
prepared. He inquired as to who were the constables at the
nearest points, and asked that certain special ones should be put
on duty, with whom he could arrange matters. I never saw anyone
approach what seemed to me to be a delicate job with such
businesslike assurance.</p>

<p>"Do you want anyone to accompany you inside?" Macgillivray
asked.</p>

<p>I said no. I thought I had better explore the place alone, but
I wanted somebody within call in case there was trouble, and of
course if I didn't come back, say within two hours, he had better
come and look for me."</p>

<p>"We may have to arrest you as a housebreaker," he said. "How
are you going to explain your presence if there's nothing wrong
indoors and you disturb the sleep of a respectable
caretaker?"</p>

<p>"I must take my chance," I said. I didn't feel nervous about
that point. The place would either be empty, or occupied by those
who would not invite the aid of the police.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>After dinner I changed into an old tweed suit and rubber-soled
shoes, and as I sat in the taxi I began to think that I had
entered too lightly on the evening's business. How was that
little man Abel to prepare an entrance without alarming the
neighbourhood, even with the connivance of the police; and if I
found anybody inside, what on earth was I to say? There was no
possible story to account for a clandestine entry into somebody
else's house, and I had suddenly a vision of the earringed Jewess
screeching in the night and my departure for the cells in the
midst of a crowd of hooligans from Apwith Lane. Even if I found
something very shady indoors it would only be shady in my own
mind in connection with my own problem, and would be all right in
the eyes of the law. I was not likely to hit on anything patently
criminal, and, even if I did, how was I to explain my presence
there? I suffered from a bad attack of cold feet, and would have
chucked the business there and then but for that queer feeling at
the back of my head that it was my duty to risk it--that if I
turned back I should be missing something of tremendous
importance. But I can tell you I was feeling far from happy when
I dismissed the taxi at the corner of Royston Square, and turned
into Little Fardell Street.</p>

<p>It was a dark cloudy evening, threatening rain, and the place
was none too brilliantly lit. But to my disgust I saw opposite
the door of the curiosity shop a brazier of hot coals and the
absurd little shelter which means that part of the street is up.
There was the usual roped-in enclosure, decorated with red lamps,
a heap of debris, and a hole where some of the setts had been
lifted. Here was bad luck with a vengeance, that the Borough
Council should have chosen this place and moment of all others
for investigating the drains. And yet I had a kind of shamefaced
feeling of relief, for this put the lid on my enterprise. I
wondered why Macgillivray had not contrived the thing better.</p>

<p>I found I had done him an injustice. It was the decorous face
of Mr. Abel which regarded me out of the dingy pent-house.</p>

<p>"This seemed to me the best plan, sir," he said respectfully.
"It enables me to wait for you here without exciting curiosity.
I've seen the men on point duty, and it is all right in that
quarter. This street is quiet enough, and taxis don't use it as a
short cut. You'll find the door open. The windows might have been
difficult, but I had a look at the door first, and that big iron
frame is a piece of bluff. The bolt of the lock runs into the
side-bar of the frame, but the frame itself is secured to the
wall by another much smaller lock which you can only detect by
looking closely. I have opened that for you--quite easily
done."</p>

<p>"But the other door--the shop door--that rings a bell
inside."</p>

<p>"I found it unlocked," he said, with the ghost of a grin.
"Whoever uses this place after closing hours doesn't want to make
much noise. The bell is disconnected. You have only to push it
open and walk in."</p>

<p>Events were forcing me against all my inclinations to go
forward.</p>

<p>"If anyone enters when I am inside? . . ." I began.</p>

<p>"You will hear the sound and must take measures accordingly.
On the whole, sir, I am inclined to think that there's something
wrong with the place. You are armed? No. That is as well. Your
position is unauthorised, as one would say, and arms might be
compromising."</p>

<p>"If you hear me cry?"</p>

<p>"I will come to your help. If you do not return within--shall
we say?--two hours, I will make an entrance along with the
nearest constable. The unlocked door will give us a pretext."</p>

<p>"And if I come out in a hurry?"</p>

<p>"I have thought of that. If you have a fair start there is
room for you to hide here," and he jerked his thumb towards the
pent-house. "If you are hard-pressed I will manage to impede the
pursuit."</p>

<p>The little man's calm matter-of-factness put me on my mettle.
I made sure that the street was empty, opened the iron frame, and
pushed through the shop-door, closing it softly behind me.</p>

<p>The shop was as dark as the inside of a nut, not a crack of
light coming through the closely-shuttered windows. I felt very
eerie, as I tiptoed cautiously among the rugs and tables. I
listened, but there was no sound of any kind either from within
or without, so I switched on my electric torch and waited
breathlessly. Still no sound or movement. The conviction grew
upon me that the house was uninhabited, and with a little more
confidence I started out to explore.</p>

<p>The place did not extend far to the back, as I had believed.
Very soon I came upon a dead wall against which every kind of
litter was stacked, and that way progress was stopped. The door
by which the Jewess had entered lay to the right, and that led me
into a little place like a kitchen, with a sink, a cupboard or
two, a gas-fire, and in the corner a bed--the kind of lair which
a caretaker occupies in a house to let. I made out a window
rather high up in the wall, but I could discover no other
entrance save that by which I had come. So I returned to the shop
and tried the passage to the left.</p>

<p>Here at first I found nothing but locked doors, obviously
cupboards. But there was one open, and my torch showed me that it
contained a very steep flight of stairs--the kind of thing that
in old houses leads to the attics. I tried the boards, for I
feared that they would creak, and I discovered that all the
treads had been renewed. I can't say I liked diving into that
box, but there was nothing else for it unless I were to give
up.</p>

<p>At the top I found a door, and I was just about to try to open
it when I heard steps on the other side.</p>

<p>I stood rigid in that narrow place, wondering what was to
happen next. The man--it was a man's foot--came up to the door
and to my consternation turned the handle. Had he opened it I
would have been discovered, for he had a light, and Lord knows
what mix-up would have followed. But he didn't; he tried the
handle and then turned a key in the lock. After that I heard him
move away.</p>

<p>This was fairly discouraging, for it appeared that I was now
shut off from the rest of the house. When I had waited for a
minute or two for the coast to clear, I too tried the handle,
expecting to find it fast. To my surprise the door opened; the
man had not locked, but unlocked it. This could mean only one of
two things. Either he intended himself to go out by this way
later, or he expected someone and wanted to let him in.</p>

<p>From that moment I recovered my composure. My interest was
excited, there was a game to play and something to be done. I
looked round the passage in which I found myself and saw the
explanation of the architecture which had puzzled me. The old
building in Little Fardell Street was the merest slip, only a
room thick, and it was plastered against a much more substantial
and much newer structure in which I now found myself. The passage
was high and broad, and heavily carpeted, and I saw electric
fittings at each end. This alarmed me, for if anyone came along
and switched on the light, there was not cover to hide a
cockroach. I considered that the boldest plan would be the
safest, so I tiptoed to the end, and saw another passage equally
bare going off at right angles. This was no good, so I brazenly
assaulted the door of the nearest room. Thank Heaven! it was
empty, so I could have a reconnoitring base.</p>

<p>It was a bedroom, well furnished in the Waring &amp; Gillow
style, and to my horror I observed that it was a woman's bedroom.
It was a woman's dressing-table I saw, with big hair-brushes and
oddments of scents and powders. There was a wardrobe with the
door ajar full of hanging dresses. The occupant had been there
quite lately, for wraps had been flung on the bed and a pair of
slippers lay by the dressing-table, as if they had been kicked
off hurriedly.</p>

<p>The place put me into the most abject fright. I seemed to have
burgled a respectable flat and landed in a lady's bedroom, and I
looked forward to some appalling scandal which would never be
hushed up. Little Abel roosting in his pent-house seemed a haven
of refuge separated from me by leagues of obstacles. I reckoned I
had better get back to him as soon as possible, and I was just
starting, when that happened which made me stop short. I had left
the room door ajar when I entered, and of course I had switched
off my torch after my first look round. I had been in utter
darkness, but now I saw a light in the passage.</p>

<p>It might be the confounded woman who owned the bedroom, and my
heart went into my boots. Then I saw that the passage lights had
not been turned on, and that whoever was there had a torch like
me. The footsteps were coming by the road I had come myself.
Could it be the man for whom the staircase door had been
unlocked?</p>

<p>It was a man all right, and, whatever his errand, it was not
with my room. I watched him through the crack left by the door,
and saw his figure pass. It was someone in a hurry who walked
swiftly and quietly, and, beyond the fact that he wore a dark
coat with the collar turned up and a black soft hat, I could make
out nothing. The figure went down the corridor, and at the end
seemed to hesitate. Then it turned into a room on the left and
disappeared.</p>

<p>There was nothing to do but wait, and happily I had not to
wait long, for I was becoming pretty nervous. The figure
reappeared, carrying something in its hand, and as it came
towards me I had a glimpse of its face. I recognised it at once
as that of the grey melancholy man whom I had seen the first
night in Medina's house, when I was coming out of my stupor. For
some reason or another that face had become stamped on my memory,
and I had been waiting to see it again. It was sad, forlorn, and
yet in a curious way pleasant; anyhow there was nothing repellent
in it. But he came from Medina, and at that thought every scrap
of hesitation and funk fled from me. I had been right in my
instinct; this place was Medina's, it was the Fields of Eden of
the rhyme. A second ago I had felt a futile blunderer; now I was
triumphant.</p>

<p>He passed my door and turned down the passage which ran at
right angles. I stepped after him and saw the light halt at the
staircase door, and then disappear. My first impulse was to
follow, tackle him in the shop, and get the truth out of him, but
I at once discarded that notion, which would have given the whole
show away. My business was to make further discoveries. I must
visit the room which had been the object of his visit.</p>

<p>I was thankful to be out of that bedroom. In the passage I
listened, but could hear no sound anywhere. There was indeed a
sound in the air, but it appeared to come from the outer world, a
sound like an organ or an orchestra a long way off. I concluded
that there must be a church somewhere near where the choir-boys
were practising.</p>

<p>The room I entered was a very queer place. It looked partly
like a museum, partly like an office, and partly like a library.
The curiosity shop had been full of rubbish, but I could see at a
glance that there was no rubbish here. There were some fine
Italian plaques--I knew something about these, for Mary collected
them--and a set of green Chinese jars which looked the real
thing. Also, there was a picture which seemed good enough to be a
Hobbema. For the rest there were several safes of a most
substantial make; but there were no papers lying about, and every
drawer of a big writing-table was locked. I had not the
wherewithal to burgle the safes and the table, even if I had
wanted to. I was certain that most valuable information lurked
somewhere in that place, but I did not see how I could get at
it.</p>

<p>I was just about to leave, when I realised that the sound of
music which I had heard in the passage was much louder here. It
was no choir-boys' practising, but strictly secular music,
apparently fiddles and drums, and the rhythm suggested a dance.
Could this odd building abut on a dance-hall? I looked at my
watch and saw that it was scarcely eleven and that I had only
been some twenty minutes indoors. I was now in a mood of almost
foolhardy confidence, so I determined to do a little more
research.</p>

<p>The music seemed to come from somewhere to the left. The
windows of the room, so far as I could judge, must look into
Wellesley Street, which showed me how I had misjudged that
thoroughfare. There might be a dancing-hall tucked in among the
automobile shops. Anyhow I wanted to see what lay beyond this
room, for there must be an entrance to it other than by the
curiosity shop. Sure enough I found a door between two bookcases
covered with a heavy <i>porti&egrave;re,</i> and emerged into
still another passage.</p>

<p>Here the music sounded louder, and I seemed to be in a place
like those warrens behind the stage in a theatre, where rooms are
of all kinds of shapes and sizes. The door at the end was locked,
and another door which I opened gave on a flight of wooden steps.
I did not want to descend just yet, so I tried another door, and
then shut it softly. For the room it opened upon was lighted, and
I had the impression of human beings not very far off. Also the
music, as I opened the door, came out in a great swelling volume
of sound.</p>

<p>I stood for a moment hesitating, and then I opened that door
again. For I had a notion that the light within did not come from
anything in the room. I found myself in a little empty chamber,
dusty and cheerless, like one of those cubby-holes you see in the
Strand, where the big plate-glass front window reaches higher
than the shop, and there is a space between the ceiling and the
next floor. All one side was of glass, in which a casement was
half open, and through the glass came the glare of a hundred
lights from somewhere beyond. Very gingerly I moved forward, till
I could look down on what was happening below.</p>

<p>For the last few seconds I think I had known what I was going
to see. It was the dancing-club which I had visited some weeks
before with Archie Roylance. There were the sham Chinese
decorations, the blaze of lights, the nigger band, the whole
garish spectacle. Only the place was far more crowded than on my
previous visit. The babble of laughter and talk which rose from
it added a further discord to the ugly music, but there was a
fierce raucous gaiety about it all, an overpowering sense of
something which might be vulgar but was also alive and ardent.
Round the skirts of the hall was the usual
<i>rastaquou&egrave;re</i> crowd of men and women drinking
liqueurs and champagne, and mixed with fat Jews and blue-black
dagos the flushed faces of boys from barracks or college who
imagined they were seeing life. I thought for a moment that I saw
Archie, but it was only one of Archie's kind, whose lean red
visage made a queer contrast with the dead white of the woman he
sat by.</p>

<p>The dancing was madder and livelier than on the last occasion.
There was more vigour in the marionettes, and I was bound to
confess that they knew their trade, little as I valued it. All
the couples were expert, and when now and then a bungler barged
in he did not stay long. I saw no sign of the girl in green whom
Archie had admired, but there were plenty like her. It was the
men I most disliked, pallid skeletons or puffy Latins, whose
clothes fitted them too well, and who were sometimes as heavily
made-up as the women.</p>

<p>One especially I singled out for violent disapproval. He was a
tall young man, with a waist like a wasp, a white face, and
hollow drugged eyes. His lips were red like a chorus-girl's, and
I would have sworn that his cheeks were rouged. Anyhow he was a
loathsome sight. But ye gods! he could dance. There was no sign
of animation in him, so that he might have been a corpse,
galvanised by some infernal power and compelled to move through
an everlasting dance of death. I noticed that his heavy eyelids
were never raised.</p>

<p>Suddenly I got a bad shock. For I realised that this mannequin
was no other than my ancient friend, the Marquis de la Tour du
Pin.</p>

<p>I hadn't recovered from that when I got a worse. He was
dancing with a woman whose hair seemed too bright to be natural.
At first I could not see her face clearly, for it was flattened
against his chest, but she seemed to be hideously and sparsely
dressed. She too knew how to dance, and the slim grace of her
body was conspicuous even in her vulgar clothes. Then she turned
her face to me, and I could see the vivid lips and the weary old
pink and white enamel of her class. Pretty, too . . .</p>

<p>And then I had a shock which nearly sent me through the
window. For in this painted dancer I recognised the wife of my
bosom and the mother of Peter John.</p>

<h1>SIR ARCHIBALD ROYLANCE PUTS HIS FOOT IN IT</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Three minutes later I was back in the curiosity shop. I
switched off my light, and very gently opened the street door.
There was a sound of footsteps on the pavement, so I drew back
till they had passed. Then I emerged into the quiet street, with
Abel's little brazier glowing in front of me, and Abel's little
sharp face poked out of his pent-house.</p>

<p>"All right, sir?" he asked cheerfully.</p>

<p>"All right," I said. "I have found what I wanted."</p>

<p>"There was a party turned up not long after you had gone in.
Lucky I had locked the door after you. He wasn't inside more than
five minutes. A party with a black topcoat turned up at the
collar--respectable party he looked--oldish--might have been a
curate. Funny thing, sir, but I guessed correctly when you were
coming back, and had the door unlocked ready for you. . . . If
you've done with me I'll clear off."</p>

<p>"Can you manage alone?" I asked. "There's a good deal to tidy
up."</p>

<p>He winked solemnly. "In an hour there won't be a sign of
anything. I have my little ways of doing things. Good night, sir,
and thank you." He was like a boots seeing a guest off from an
hotel.</p>

<p>I found that the time was just after half-past eleven, so I
walked to Tottenham Court Road and picked up a taxi, telling the
man to drive to Great Charles Street in Westminster. Mary was in
London, and I must see her at once. She had chosen to take a hand
in the game, probably at Sandy's instigation, and I must find out
what exactly she was doing. The business was difficult enough
already with Sandy following his own trail and me forbidden to
get into touch with him, but if Mary was also on the job it would
be naked chaos unless I knew her plans. I own I felt miserably
nervous. There was nobody in the world whose wisdom I put higher
than hers, and I would have trusted her to the other side of
Tophet, but I hated to think of a woman mixed up in something so
ugly and perilous. She was far too young and lovely to be safe on
the back-stairs. And yet I remembered that she had been in uglier
affairs before this and I recalled old Blenkiron's words: "She
can't scare and she can't soil." And then I began to get a sort
of comfort from the feeling that she was along with me in the
game; it made me feel less lonely. But it was pretty rough luck
on Peter John. Anyhow I must see her, and I argued that she would
probably be staying with her Wymondham aunts, and that in any
case I could get news of her there.</p>

<p>The Misses Wymondham were silly ladies, but their butler would
have made Montmartre respectable. He and I had always got on
well, and I think the only thing that consoled him when Fosse was
sold was that Mary and I were to have it. The house in Great
Charles Street was one of those tremendously artistic new
dwellings with which the intellectual plutocracy have adorned the
Westminster slums.</p>

<p>"Is her ladyship home yet?" I asked.</p>

<p>"No, Sir Richard, but she said she wouldn't be late. I expect
her any moment."</p>

<p>"Then I think I'll come in and wait. How are you, Barnard?
Found your city legs yet?"</p>

<p>"I am improving, Sir Richard, I thank you. Very pleased to
have Miss Mary here, if I may take the liberty of so speaking of
her. Miss Claire is in Paris still, and Miss Wymondham is dancing
to-night, and won't be back till very late. How are things at
Fosse, sir, if I may make so bold? And how is the young
gentleman? Miss Mary has shown me his photograph. A very handsome
young gentleman, sir, and favours yourself."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, Barnard. He's the living image of his mother. Get
me a drink, like a good fellow. A tankard of beer, if you have
it, for I've a throat like a grindstone."</p>

<p>I drank the beer and waited in a little room which would have
been charming but for the garish colour scheme which Mary's aunts
had on the brain. I was feeling quite cheerful again, for Peter
John's photograph was on the mantelpiece and I reckoned that any
minute Mary might be at the doorway.</p>

<p>She came in just before midnight. I heard her speak to Barnard
in the hall, and then her quick step outside the door. She was
preposterously dressed, but she must have done something to her
face in the taxi, for the paint was mostly rubbed from it,
leaving it very pale.</p>

<p>"Oh, Dick, my darling," she cried, tearing off her cloak and
running to my arms. "I never expected you. There's nothing wrong
at home?"</p>

<p>"Not that I know of, except that it's deserted. Mary, what on
earth brought you here?"</p>

<p>"You're not angry, Dick?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit--only curious."</p>

<p>"How did you know I was here?"</p>

<p>"Guessed. I thought it the likeliest cover to draw. You see
I've been watching you dancing to-night. Look here, my dear, if
you put so much paint and powder on your face and jam it so close
to old Turpin's chest, it won't be easy for the poor fellow to
keep his shirt-front clean."</p>

<p>"You--watched--me--dancing! Were you in that place?"</p>

<p>"Well, I wouldn't say <i>in</i> it. But I had a prospect of
the show from the gallery. And it struck me that the sooner we
met and had a talk the better."</p>

<p>"The gallery! Were you in the house? I don't understand."</p>

<p>"No more do I. I burgled a certain house in a back street for
very particular reasons of my own. In the process I may mention
that I got one of the worst frights of my life. After various
adventures I came to a place where I heard the dickens of a row
which I made out to be dance music. Eventually I found a dirty
little room with a window and to my surprise looked down on a
dancing-hall. I know it, for I had once been there with Archie
Roylance. That was queer enough, but imagine my surprise when I
saw my wedded wife, raddled like a geisha, dancing with an old
friend who seemed to have got himself up to imitate a
wax-work."</p>

<p>She seemed scarcely to be listening. "But in the house! Did
you see no one?"</p>

<p>"I saw one man and I heard another. The fellow I saw was a man
I once met in the small hours with Medina."</p>

<p>"But the other? You didn't see him? You didn't hear him go
out?"</p>

<p>"No." I was puzzled at her excitement. "Why are you so keen
about the other?"</p>

<p>"Because I think--I'm sure--it was Sandy--Colonel
Arbuthnot."</p>

<p>This was altogether beyond me. "Impossible!" I cried. "The
place is a lair of Medina's. The man I saw was Medina's servant
or satellite. Do you mean to say that Sandy has been exploring
that house?"</p>

<p>She nodded. "You see it is the Fields of Eden."</p>

<p>"Oh, I know. I found that out for myself. Do you tell me that
Sandy discovered it too?"</p>

<p>"Yes. That is why I was there. That is why I have been living
a perfectly loathsome life and am now dressed like a chorus
girl."</p>

<p>"Mary," I said solemnly, "my fine brain won't support any more
violent shocks. Will you please to sit down beside me, and give
me the plain tale of all you have been doing since I said
good-bye to you at Fosse?"</p>

<p>"First," she said, "I had a visit from a dramatic critic on
holiday, Mr. Alexander Thomson. He said he knew you and that you
had suggested that he should call. He came three times to Fosse,
but only once to the house. Twice I met him in the woods. He told
me a good many things, and one was that he couldn't succeed and
you couldn't succeed, unless I helped. He thought that if a woman
was lost only a woman could find her. In the end he persuaded me.
You said yourself, Dick, that Nanny was quite competent to take
charge of Peter John, with Dr. Greenslade so close at hand. And I
hear from her every day, and he is very well and happy."</p>

<p>"You came to London. But when?"</p>

<p>"The day you came back from Norway."</p>

<p>"But I've been having letters regularly from you since
then."</p>

<p>"That is my little arrangement with Paddock. I took him into
my confidence. I send him the letters in batches and he posts one
daily."</p>

<p>"Then you've been here more than a fortnight. Have you seen
Sandy?"</p>

<p>"Twice. He has arranged my life for me, and has introduced me
to my dancing partner, the Marquis de la Tour du Pin, whom you
call Turpin. I think I have had the most horrible, the most
wearing time that any woman ever had. I have moved in raffish
circles and have had to be the most raffish of the lot. Do you
know, Dick, I believe I'm really a good actress? I have acquired
a metallic voice, and a high silly laugh, and hard eyes, and when
I lie in bed at night I blush all over for my shamelessness. I
know you hate it, but you can't hate it more than I do. But it
had to be done. I couldn't be a 'piker,' as Mr. Blenkiron used to
say."</p>

<p>"Any luck?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," she said wearily. "I have found Miss Victor. It
wasn't very difficult, really. When I had made friends with the
funny people that frequent these places it wasn't hard to see who
was different from the others. They're all mannequins, but the
one I was looking for was bound to be the most mannequinish of
the lot. I wanted someone without mind or soul, and I found her.
Besides, I had a clue to start with. Odell, you know."</p>

<p>"It was the green girl."</p>

<p>She nodded. "I couldn't be certain, of course, till I had her
lover to help me. He is a good man, your French Marquis. He has
played his part splendidly. You see, it would never do to try to
<i>awake</i> Adela Victor now. We couldn't count on her being
able to keep up appearances without arousing suspicion, till the
day of release arrived. But something had to be done, and that is
my business especially. I have made friends with her, and I talk
to her and I have attached her to me just a little, like a dog.
That will give me the chance to do the rest quickly when the
moment comes. You cannot bring back a vanished soul all at once
unless you have laid some foundation. We have to be very, very
careful, for she is keenly watched, but I think--yes, I am
sure--it is going well."</p>

<p>"Oh, bravo!" I cried. "That makes Number Two. I may tell you
that I have got Number One." I gave her a short account of my
doings in Norway. "Two of the poor devils will get out of the
cage anyhow. I wonder if it wouldn't be possible to pass the word
to Victor and the Duke. It would relieve their anxiety."</p>

<p>"I thought of that," she replied, "but Colonel Arbuthnot says
No, on no account. He says it might ruin everything. He takes a
very solemn view of the affair, you know. And so do I. I have
seen Mr. Medina."</p>

<p>"Where?" I asked in astonishment.</p>

<p>"I got Aunt Doria to take me to a party where he was to be
present. Don't be worried. I wasn't introduced to him, and he
never heard my name. But I watched him, and knowing what I did I
was more afraid than I have ever been in my life. He is
extraordinarily attractive--no, not attractive--seductive, and he
is as cold and hard as chilled steel. You know these impressions
I get of people which I can't explain--you say they are always
right. Well, I felt him almost superhuman. He exhales ease and
power like a god, but it is a god from a lost world. I can see
that, like a god too, it is souls that he covets. Ordinary human
badness seems decent in comparison with that Lucifer's pride of
his. I think if I ever could commit murder it would be his life I
would take. I should feel like Charlotte Corday. Oh, I'm dismally
afraid of him."</p>

<p>"I'm not," I said stoutly, "and I see him at closer quarters
than most people." The measure of success we had attained was
beginning to make me confident.</p>

<p>"Colonel Arbuthnot is afraid for you," she said. "The two
times I have seen him in London he kept harping on the need of
your keeping very near to him. I think he meant me to warn you.
He says that when you are fighting a man with a long-range weapon
the only chance is to hug him. Dick, didn't you tell me that Mr.
Medina suggested that you should stay in his house? I have been
thinking a lot about that, and I believe it would be the safest
plan. Once he saw you secure in his pocket he might forget about
you."</p>

<p>"It would be most infernally awkward, for I should have no
freedom of movement. But all the same I believe you are right.
Things may grow very hectic as we get near the day."</p>

<p>"Besides, you might find out something about Number Three. Oh,
it is the little boy that breaks my heart. The others might
escape on their own account--some day, but unless we find
<i>him</i> he is lost for ever. And Colonel Arbuthnot says that,
even if we found him, it might be hard to restore the child's
mind. Unless--unless--"</p>

<p>Mary's face had become grim, if one could use the word of a
thing so soft and gentle. Her hands were tightly clasped, and her
eyes had a strained far-away look.</p>

<p>"I am going to find him," she cried. "Listen, Dick. That man
despises women and rules them out of his life, except in so far
as he can make tools of them. But there is one woman who is going
to stop at nothing to beat him. . . . When I think of that little
David I grow mad and desperate. I am afraid of myself. Have you
no hope to give me?"</p>

<p>"I haven't the shadow of a clue," I said dolefully. "Has Sandy
none?"</p>

<p>She shook her head. "He is so small, the little fellow, and so
easy to hide."</p>

<p>"If I were in Central Africa, I would get Medina by the
throat, and peg him down and torture him till he disgorged."</p>

<p>Again she shook her head. "Those methods are useless here. He
would laugh at you, for he isn't a coward--at least I think not.
Besides, he is certain to be magnificently guarded. And for the
rest he has the entrenchments of his reputation and popularity,
and a quicker brain than any of us. He can put a spell of
blindness on the world--on all men and nearly all women."</p>

<p>The arrival of Miss Wymondham made me get up to leave. She was
still the same odd-looking creature, with a mass of tow-coloured
hair piled above her long white face. She had been dancing
somewhere, and looked at once dog-tired and excited. "Mary has
been having such a good time," she told me. "Even I can scarcely
keep pace with her ardent youth. Can't you persuade her to do her
hair differently? The present arrangement is so
<i>d&eacute;mod&eacute;</i> and puts her whole figure out of
drawing. Nancy Travers was speaking about it only to-night.
Properly turned out, she said, Mary would be the most ravishing
thing in London. By the way, I saw your friend Sir Archie
Roylance at the Parminters'. He is lunching here on Thursday.
Will you come, Richard?"</p>

<p>I told her that my plans were vague and that I thought I might
be out of town. But I arranged with Mary before I left to keep me
informed at the Club of any news that came from Sandy. As I
walked back I was infected by her distress over little David
Warcliff. That was the most grievous business of all, and I saw
no light in it, for though everything else happened according to
plan, we should never be able to bring Medina to book. The more I
thought of it the more hopeless our case against him seemed to
be. We might free the hostages, but we could never prove that he
had had anything to do with them. I could give damning evidence,
to be sure, but who would take my word against his? And I had no
one to confirm me. Supposing I indicted him for kidnapping and
told the story of what I knew about the Blind Spinner and
Newhover and Odell? He and the world would simply laugh at me,
and I should probably have to pay heavy damages for libel. None
of his satellites, I was certain, would ever give him away; they
couldn't, even if they wanted to, for they didn't know anything.
No, Sandy was right. We might have a measure of success, but
there would be no victory. And yet only victory would give us
full success, for only to get him on his knees, gibbering with
terror, would restore the poor little boy. I strode through the
empty streets with a sort of hopeless fury in my heart.</p>

<p>One thing puzzled me. What was Sandy doing in that house
behind the curiosity shop, if indeed it was Sandy? Whoever had
been there had been in league with the sad grey man whom I
watched from behind the bedroom door. Now the man was part of
Medina's entourage: I had no doubt about the accuracy of my
recollection. Had Sandy dealings with someone inside the enemy's
citadel? I didn't see how that was possible, for he had told me
he was in deadly danger from Medina, and that his only chance was
to make him believe that he was out of Europe. . . . As I went to
bed, one thing was very clear in my mind. If Medina asked me to
stay with him, I would accept. It would probably be safer, though
I wasn't so much concerned about that, and it would possibly be
more fruitful. I might find out something about the grey man.</p>

<p>Next day I went to see Medina, for I wanted him to believe
that I couldn't keep away from him. He was in tremendous spirits
about something or other, and announced that he was going off to
the country for a couple of days. He made me stay to luncheon,
when I had another look at Odell, who seemed to be getting fat.
"Your wind, my lad," I said to myself, "can't be as good as it
should be. You wouldn't have my money in a scrap." I hoped that
Medina was going to have a holiday, for he had been doing a good
deal lately in the way of speaking, but he said "No such luck."
He was going down to the country on business--an estate of which
he was a trustee wanted looking into. I asked in what part of
England, and he said Shropshire. He liked that neighbourhood and
had an idea of buying a place there when he had more leisure.</p>

<p>Somehow that led me to speak of his poetry. He was surprised
to learn that I had been studying the little books, and I could
see took it as a proof of my devotion. I made a few fulsome
observations on their merits, and said that even an ignorant
fellow like me could see how dashed good they were. I also
remarked that they seemed to me a trifle melancholy.</p>

<p>"Melancholy!" he said. "It's a foolish world, Hannay, and a
wise man must have his moods of contempt. Victory loses some of
its salt when it is won over fools."</p>

<p>And then he said what I had been waiting for. "I told you
weeks ago that I wanted you to take up your quarters with me.
Well, I repeat the offer and will take no refusal."</p>

<p>"It is most awfully kind of you," I stammered. "But wouldn't I
be in the way?"</p>

<p>"Not in the least. You see the house--it's as large as a
barracks. I'll be back from Shropshire by Friday, and I expect
you to move in here on Friday evening. We might dine
together."</p>

<p>I was content, for it gave me a day or two to look about me.
Medina went off that afternoon, and I spent a restless evening. I
wanted to be with Mary, but it seemed to me that the less I saw
her the better. She was going her own way, and if I showed myself
in her neighbourhood it might ruin all. Next day was no better; I
actually longed for Medina to return so that I might feel I was
doing something, for there was nothing I could turn my hand to,
and when I was idle the thought of David Warcliff was always
present to torment me. I went out to Hampton Court and had a long
row on the river; then I dined at the Club and sat in the little
back smoking-room, avoiding anyone I knew, and trying to read a
book of travels in Arabia. I fell asleep in my chair, and, waking
about half-past eleven, was staggering off to bed, when a servant
came to tell me that I was wanted on the telephone.</p>

<p>It was Mary; she was speaking from Great Charles Street and
her voice was sharp with alarm.</p>

<p>"There's been an awful mishap, Dick," she said breathlessly.
"Are you alone? You're sure there's no one there? . . . Archie
Roylance has made a dreadful mess of things. . . . He came to
that dancing-place to-night, and Adela Victor was there, and
Odell with her. Archie had seen her before, you know, and
apparently was much attracted. No! He didn't recognise me, for
when I saw him I kept out of range. But of course he recognised
the Marquis. He danced with Adela, and I suppose he talked
nonsense to her--anyhow he made himself conspicuous. The result
was that Odell proposed to take her away--I suppose he was
suspicious of anybody of Archie's world--and, well, there was a
row. The place was very empty--only about a dozen, and mostly a
rather bad lot. Archie asked what right he had to carry off the
girl, and lost his temper, and the manager was called in--the man
with the black beard. He backed up Odell, and then Archie did a
very silly thing. He said he was Sir Archibald Roylance and
wasn't going to be dictated to by any Jew, and, worse, he said
his friend was the Marquis de la Tour du Pin, and that between
them they would burst up this show, and that he wouldn't have a
poor girl ordered about by a third-rate American bully. . . . I
don't know what happened afterwards. The women were hustled out,
and I had to go with the rest. . . . But, Dick, it's bad trouble.
I'm not afraid so much for Archie, though he has probably had a
bad mauling, but the Marquis. They're sure to know who he is and
all about him and remember his connection with Adela. They're
almost certain to make certain in some horrible way that he can't
endanger them again.</p>

<p>"Lord," I groaned, "what a catastrophe! And what on earth can
I do? I daren't take any part!"</p>

<p>"No," came a hesitating voice. "I suppose not. But you can
warn the Marquis--if nothing has happened to him already."</p>

<p>"Precious poor chance. These fellows don't waste time. But go
to bed and sleep, my dear. I'll do my best."</p>

<p>My best at that time of night was pretty feeble. I rang up
Victor's house and found, as I expected, that Turpin had not
returned. Then I rang up Archie's house in Grosvenor Street and
got the same answer about him. It was no good my going off to the
back streets of Marylebone, so I went to bed and spent a wretched
night.</p>

<p>Very early next morning I was in Grosvenor Street, and there I
had news. Archie's man had just had a telephone message from a
hospital to say that his master had had an accident, and would he
come round and bring clothes. He packed a bag and he and I drove
there at once, and found the miserable Archie in bed, the victim
officially of a motor accident. He did not seem to be very bad,
but it was a rueful face, much battered about the eyes and
bandaged as to the jaw, which was turned on me when the nurse
left us.</p>

<p>"You remember what I said about the pug with the diamond
studs," he whistled through damaged teeth. "Well, I took him on
last night and got tidily laid out. I'm not up to professional
standards, and my game leg made me slow."</p>

<p>"You've put your foot into it most nobly," I said. "What do
you mean by brawling in a dance-club? You've embarrassed me
horribly in the job I'm on."</p>

<p>"But how?" he asked, and but for the bandage his jaw would
have dropped.</p>

<p>"Never mind how at present. I want to know exactly what
happened. It's more important than you think."</p>

<p>He told me the same story that I had heard from Mary, but much
garlanded with objurgations. He denied that he had dined too
well--"nothing but a small whisky-and-soda and one glass of
port." He had been looking for the girl in green for some time,
and having found her, was not going to miss the chance of making
her acquaintance. "A melancholy little being with nothin' to say
for herself. She's had hard usage from some swine--you could see
it by her eyes--and I expect the pug's the villain. Anyway, I
wasn't goin' to stand his orderin' her about like a slave. So I
told him so, and a fellow with a black beard chipped in and they
began to hustle me. Then I did a dam' silly thing. I tried to
solemnise 'em by sayin' who I was, and old Turpin was there, so I
dragged his name in. Dashed caddish thing to do, but I thought a
Marquis would put the wind up that crowd."</p>

<p>"Did he join in?"</p>

<p>"I don't know--I rather fancy he got scragged at the start.
Anyhow I found myself facin' the pug, seein' bright red, and
inclined to fight a dozen. I didn't last for more than one
round--my game leg cramped me, I suppose. I got in one or two on
his ugly face, and then I suppose I took a knock-out. After that
I don't remember anything till I woke up in this bed feelin' as
if I had been through a mangle. The people here say I was brought
in by two bobbies and a fellow with a motor-car, who said I had
walked slap into his bonnet at a street corner and hurt my face.
He was very concerned about me, but omitted to leave his name and
address. Very thoughtful of the sweeps to make sure there would
be no scandal. . . . I say, Dick, you don't suppose this will get
into the newspapers? I don't want to be placarded as havin' been
in such a vulgar shindy just as I'm thinkin' of goin' in for
Parliament."</p>

<p>"I don't think there's the remotest chance of your hearing
another word about it, unless you talk too much yourself. Look
here, Archie, you've got to promise me never to go near that
place again, and never on any account whatever to go hunting for
that girl in green. I'll tell you my reasons some day, but you
can take it that they're good ones. Another thing. You've got to
keep out of Turpin's way. I only hope you haven't done him
irreparable damage because of your idiocy last night."</p>

<p>Archie was desperately penitent. "I know I behaved like a cad.
I'll go and grovel to old Turpin as soon as they let me up. But
he's all right--sure to be. He wasn't lookin' for a fight like
me. I expect he only got shoved into the street and couldn't get
back again."</p>

<p>I did not share Archie's optimism, and very soon my fear was a
certainty. I went straight from the hospital to Carlton House
Terrace, and found Mr. Victor at breakfast. I learned that the
Marquis de la Tour du Pin had been dining out on the previous
evening and had not returned.</p>

<h1><a name="c15">CHAPTER XV</a></h1>

<h1>HOW A FRENCH NOBLEMAN DISCOVERED FEAR</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>I have twice heard from Turpin the story I am going to set
down--once before he understood much of it, a second time when he
had got some enlightenment--but I doubt whether to his dying day
he will ever be perfectly clear about what happened to him.</p>

<p>I have not had time to introduce Turpin properly, and in any
case I am not sure that the job is not beyond me. My liking for
the French is profound, but I believe there is no race on earth
which the average Briton is less qualified to comprehend. For
myself, I could far more easily get inside the skin of a Boche. I
knew he was as full of courage as a Berserker, pretty mad, but
with that queer core of prudence which your Latin possesses and
which in the long run makes his madness less dangerous than an
Englishman's. He was high-strung, excitable, imaginative, and I
should have said in a general way very sensitive to influences
such as Medina wielded. But he was forewarned. Mary had told him
the main lines of the business, and he was playing the part she
had set him as dutifully as a good child. I had not done justice
to his power of self-control. He saw his sweetheart leading that
blind unearthly life, and it must have been torture to him to do
nothing except look on. But he never attempted to wake her
memory, but waited obediently till Mary gave orders, and played
the part to perfection of the ordinary half-witted dancing
mountebank.</p>

<p>When the row with Archie started, and the scurry began, he had
the sense to see that he must keep out of it. Then he heard
Archie speak his real name, and saw the mischief involved in
that, for nobody knew him except Mary, and he had passed as a
Monsieur Claud Simond from Buenos Aires. When he saw his friend
stand up to the bruiser, he started off instinctively to his
help, but stopped in time and turned to the door. The man with
the black beard was looking at him, but said nothing.</p>

<p>There seemed to be a good deal of racket at the foot of the
stairs. One of the girls caught his arm. "No good that way," she
whispered. "It's a raid all right. There's another road out. You
don't want your name in to-morrow's papers."</p>

<p>He followed her into a little side passage, which was almost
empty and very dark, and there he lost her. He was just starting
to prospect, when he saw a little dago whom he recognised as one
of the bar-tenders. "Up the stairs, monsieur," the man said.
"Then first to the left and down again. You come out in the yard
of the Apollo Garage. Quick, monsieur, or <i>les flics</i> will
be here."</p>

<p>Turpin sped up the steep wooden stairs, and found himself in
another passage fairly well lit, with a door at each end. He took
the one to the left, and dashed through, wondering how he was to
recover his hat and coat, and also what had become of Mary. The
door opened easily enough, and in his haste he took two steps
forward. It swung behind him, so that he was in complete
darkness, and he turned back to open it again to give him light.
But it would not open. With the shutting of that door he walked
clean out of the world.</p>

<p>At first he was angry, and presently, when he realised his
situation, a little alarmed. The place seemed to be small, it was
utterly dark, and as stuffy as the inside of a safe. His chief
thought at the moment was that it would never do for him to be
caught in a raid on a dance-club, for his true name might come
out and the harm which Archie's foolish tongue had wrought might
be thereby aggravated. But soon he saw that he had stepped out of
one kind of danger into what was probably a worse. He was locked
in an infernal cupboard in a house which he knew to have the most
unholy connections.</p>

<p>He started to grope around, and found that the place was
larger than he thought. The walls were bare, the floor seemed to
be of naked boards, and there was not a stick of furniture
anywhere, nor, so far as he could see, any window. He could not
discover the door he had entered by, which on the inside must
have been finished dead level with the walls. Presently he found
that his breathing was difficult, and that almost put him in a
panic, for the dread of suffocation had always been for him the
private funk from which the bravest man is not free. To breathe
was like having his face tightly jammed against a pillow. He made
an effort and controlled himself, for he realised that if he let
himself become hysterical he would only suffocate the faster. . .
.</p>

<p>Then he declares that he felt a hand pressing on his mouth. .
. . It must have been imagination, for he admits that the place
was empty, but all the same the hand came again and again--a
large soft hand smelling of roses. His nerves began to scream,
and his legs to give under him. The roses came down on him in a
cloud, and that horrible flabby hand, as big as a hill, seemed to
smother him. He tried to move, to get away from it, and before he
knew he found himself on his knees. He struggled to get up, but
the hand was on him, flattening him out, and that intolerable
sweet sickly odour swathed him in its nauseous folds. . . . And
then he lost consciousness. . . .</p>

<p>How long he was senseless he doesn't know, but he thinks it
must have been a good many hours. When he came to he was no
longer in the cupboard. He was lying on what seemed to be a couch
in a room which felt spacious, for he could breathe freely, but
it was still as black as the nether pit. He had a blinding
headache, and felt rather sick and as silly as an owl. He
couldn't remember how he had come there, but as his hand fell on
his shirt-front, and he realised he was in dress clothes, he
recollected Archie's cry. That was the last clear thing in his
head, but it steadied him, for it reminded him how grave was his
danger. He has told me that at first he was half stifled with
panic, for he was feeling abominably weak; but he had just enough
reason left in him to let him take a pull on his nerves. "You
must be a man," he repeated to himself. "Even if you have
stumbled into hell, you must be a man."</p>

<p>Then a voice spoke out of the darkness, and at the sound of it
most of his fright disappeared. It was no voice that he knew, but
a pleasant voice, and it spoke to him in French. Not ordinary
French, you understand, but the French of his native valley in
the South, with the soft slurring patois of his home. It seemed
to drive away his headache and nausea, and to soothe every
jangled nerve, but it made him weaker. Of that he has no doubt.
This friendly voice was making him a child again.</p>

<p>His memory of what it said is hopelessly vague. He thinks that
it reminded him of the life of his boyhood--the old chateau high
in a fold of the limestone hills, the feathery chestnuts in the
valley bottom, the clear pools where the big trout lived, the
snowy winters when the wolves came out of the forests to the
farmyard doors, the hot summers when the roads were blinding
white and the turf on the downs grew as yellow as corn. The
memory of it was all jumbled, and whatever the voice said its
effect was more like music than spoken words. It smoothed out the
creases in his soul, but it stole also the manhood from him. He
was becoming limp and docile and passive like a weak child.</p>

<p>The voice stopped and he felt a powerful inclination to sleep.
Then suddenly, between sleeping and waking, he became aware of a
light, a star which glowed ahead of him in the darkness. It waxed
and then waned, and held his eyes like a vice. At the back of his
head he knew that there was some devilry in the business, that it
was something which he ought to resist, but for the life of him
he could not remember why.</p>

<p>The light broadened till it was like the circle which a
magic-lantern makes on a screen. Into the air there crept a
strange scent--not the sickly smell of roses, but a hard pungent
smell which tantalised him with its familiarity. Where had he met
it before? . . . Slowly out of it there seemed to shape a whole
world of memories.</p>

<p>Now Turpin before the War had put in some years' service in
Africa with the Arm&eacute;e Coloniale as a lieutenant of Spahis,
and had gone with various engineering and military expeditions
south of the Algerian frontier into the desert. He used to rave
to me about the glories of those lost days, that first youth of a
man which does not return. . . . This smell was the desert, that
unforgettable, untameable thing which stretches from the
Mediterranean to the Central African forests, the place where, in
the days when it was sea, Ulysses wandered, and where the magic
of Circe and Calypso for all the world knows may still
linger.</p>

<p>In the moon of light a face appeared, a face so strongly lit
up that every grim and subtle line of it was magnified. It was an
Eastern face, a lean high-boned Arab face, with the eyes set in a
strange slant. He had never seen it before, but he had met
something like it when he had dabbled in the crude magic of the
sands, the bubbling pot, and the green herb fire. At first it was
only a face, half averted, and then it seemed to move so that the
eyes appeared, like lights suddenly turned on at night as one
looks from without at a dark house.</p>

<p>He felt in every bone a thing he had almost forgotten, the
spell and the terror of the desert. It was a cruel and inhuman
face, hiding God knows what of ancient horror and sin, but wise
as the Sphinx and eternal as the rocks. As he stared at it the
eyes seemed to master and envelop him, and, as he put it, suck
the soul out of him.</p>

<p>You see he had never been told about Khar&aacute;ma. That was
the one mistake Mary made, and a very natural one, for it was not
likely that he and the Indian would foregather. So he had nothing
in his poor muddled head to help him to combat this mastering
presence. He didn't try. He said he felt himself sinking into a
delicious lethargy, like the coma which overtakes a man who is
being frozen to death.</p>

<p>I could get very little out of Turpin about what happened
next. The face spoke to him, but whether in French or some
African tongue he didn't know--French, he thought--certainly not
English. I gather that, while the eyes and the features were to
the last degree awe-inspiring, the voice was, if anything,
friendly. It told him that he was in instant danger, and that the
only hope lay in utter impassivity. If he attempted to exercise
his own will, he was doomed, and there was sufficient indication
of what that doom meant to shake his lethargy into spasms of
childish fear. "Your body is too feeble to move," said the voice,
"for Allah has laid His hand on it." Sure enough Turpin realised
that he hadn't the strength of a kitten. "You have surrendered
your will to Allah till He restores it to you." That also was
true, for Turpin knew he could not summon the energy to brush his
hair, unless he was ordered to. "You will be safe," said the
voice, "so long as you sleep. You will sleep till I bid you
awake."</p>

<p>Sleep he probably did, for once again came a big gap in his
consciousness. . . . The next he knew he was being jolted in
something that ran on wheels, and he suddenly rolled over on his
side, as the vehicle took a sharp turn. This time it didn't take
him quite so long to wake up. He found he was in a big motor-car,
with his overcoat on, and his hat on the seat beside him. He was
stretched out almost at full length, and comfortably propped up
with cushions. All this he realised fairly soon, but it was some
time before he could gather up the past, and then it was all
blurred and sketchy. . . . What he remembered most clearly was
the warning that he was in grave peril and was only safe while he
did nothing. That was burned in on his mind, and the lesson was
pointed by the complete powerlessness of his limbs. He could
hardly turn over from his side to his back, and he knew that if
he attempted to stand he would fall down in a heap. He shut his
eyes and tried to think.</p>

<p>Bit by bit the past pieced itself together. He remembered
Archie's cry--and things before that--Mary--the girl in green.
Very soon the truth smote him in the face. He had been kidnapped
like the rest, and had had the same tricks played on him. . . .
But they had only affected his body. As he realised this
tremendous fact Turpin swelled with pride. Some devilry had
stolen his physical strength, but his soul was his own still, his
memory and his will. A sort of miasma of past fear still clung
about him, like the after-taste of influenza, but this only
served to make him angry. He was most certainly not going to be
beaten. The swine had miscalculated this time; they might have a
cripple in their hands, but it would be a very watchful, wary,
and determined cripple, quick to seize the first chance to be
even with them. His anger made his spirits rise. All his life he
had been a man of tropical loves and tempestuous hates. He had
loathed the Boche, and free-masons, and communists and the
deputies of his own land, and ever since Adela's disappearance he
had nursed a fury against a person or persons unknown: and now
every detestation of which he was capable had been focussed
against those who were responsible for this night's work. The
fools! They thought they had got a trussed sheep, when all the
time it was a lame tiger.</p>

<p>The blinds of the car were down, but by small painful
movements he managed to make out that there was a man in the
front seat beside the chauffeur. By and by he got a corner of the
right-hand blind raised, and saw that it was night time and that
they were moving through broad streets that looked like a suburb.
From the beat of the engine he gathered that the car was a
Rolls-Royce, but not, he thought, one of the latest models.
Presently the motion became less regular, and he realised that
the suburban streets were giving place to country roads. His many
expeditions in his Delage had taught him a good deal about the
ways out of London, but, try as he might, he could not pick up
any familiar landmark. The young moon had set, so he assumed that
it was near midnight; it was a fine, clear night, not very dark,
and he picked up an occasional inn and church, but they never
seemed to pass through any village. Probably the driver was
taking the less frequented roads--a view he was confirmed in by
the frequent right-angled turns and the many patches of
indifferent surface.</p>

<p>Very soon he found his efforts at reconnaissance so painful
that he gave them up, and contented himself with planning his
policy. Of course he must play the part of the witless sheep.
That duty, he thought, presented no difficulties, for he rather
fancied himself as an actor. The trouble was his bodily
condition. He did not believe that a constitution as good as his
could have taken any permanent damage from the night's work. . .
. The night's! He must have been away for more than one night,
for the row with Archie had taken place very near twelve o'clock.
This must be the midnight following. He wondered what Mr. Victor
was thinking about it--and Mary--and Hannay. The miserable Hannay
had now four lost ones to look for instead of three! . . . Anyhow
the devils had got an ugly prisoner in him. His body must soon be
all right, unless of course they took steps to keep it all wrong.
At that thought Turpin's jaw set. The r&ocirc;le of the docile
sheep might be difficult to keep up very long.</p>

<p>The next he knew the car had turned in at a gate and was
following a dark tree-lined avenue. In another minute it had
stopped before the door of a house, and he was being lifted out
by the chauffeur and the man from the front seat, and carried
into a hall. But first a dark bandanna was tied over his eyes,
and, as he could do nothing with his arms or legs, he had to
submit. He felt himself carried up a short staircase, and then
along a corridor into a bedroom, where a lamp was lit. Hands
undressed him--his eyes still bandaged--and equipped him with
pyjamas which were not his own, and were at once too roomy and
too short. Then food was brought, and an English voice observed
that he had better have some supper before going to sleep. The
bandage was taken off and he saw two male backs disappearing
through the door.</p>

<p>Up till now he had felt no hunger or thirst, but the sight of
food made him realise that he was as empty as a drum. By twisting
his head he could see it all laid out on the table beside his
bed--a good meal it looked--cold ham and galantine, an omelette,
a salad, cheese and a small decanter of red wine. His soul longed
for it, but what about his feeble limbs? Was this some new
torture of Tantalus?</p>

<p>Desire grew, and like an automaton he moved to it. He felt all
numbed, with needles and pins everywhere, but surely he was less
feeble than he had been in the car. First he managed to get his
right arm extended, and by flexing the elbow and wrist a certain
life seemed to creep back. Then he did the same thing with his
right leg, and presently found that he could wriggle by inches to
the edge of the bed. He was soon out of breath, but there could
be no doubt about it--he was getting stronger. A sudden access of
thirst enabled him to grasp the decanter, and, after some trouble
with the stopper, to draw it to his lips. Spilling a good deal,
he succeeded in getting a mouthful. "Larose," he murmured, "and a
good vintage. It would have been better if it had been
cognac."</p>

<p>But the wine put new life into him. He found he could use both
arms, and he began wolfishly on the omelette, making a rather
messy job of it. By this time he was feeling a remarkably
vigorous convalescent, and he continued with the cold meat, till
the cramp in his left shoulder forced him to lie back on the
pillow. It soon passed, and he was able in fair comfort to finish
the meal down to the last lettuce leaf of the salad, and the last
drop of the claret. The Turpin who reclined again on the bed was
to all intents the same vigorous young man who the night before
had stumbled through that fateful door into the darkness. But it
was a Turpin with a profoundly mystified mind.</p>

<p>He would have liked to smoke, but his cigarettes were in the
pocket of his dress clothes which had been removed. So he started
to do for his legs what he had already achieved for his arms, and
with the same happy results. It occurred to him that, while he
was alone, he had better discover whether or not he could stand.
He made the effort, rolled out of bed on to the floor, hit the
little table with his head and set the dishes rattling.</p>

<p>But after a few scrambles he got to his feet and managed to
shuffle round the room. The mischief was leaving his body--so
much was plain, and but for a natural stiffness in the joints he
felt as well as ever. But what it all meant he hadn't a notion.
He was inclined to the belief that somehow he had scored off his
enemies, and was a tougher proposition than they had bargained
for. They had assuredly done no harm to his mind with their
witchcraft, and it looked as if they had also failed with his
body. The thought emboldened him. The house seemed quiet; why
should he not do a little exploration?</p>

<p>He cautiously opened the door, finding it, somewhat to his
surprise, unlocked. The passage was lit by a hanging oil-lamp,
carpeted with an old-fashioned drugget, and its walls decorated
with a set of flower pictures. Turpin came to the conclusion that
rarely in his life had he been in a dwelling which seemed more
innocent and homelike. He considered himself sensitive to the
<i>nuances</i> of the sinister in an atmosphere, and there was
nothing of that sort in this. He took a step or two down the
passage, and then halted, for he thought he heard a sound. Yes,
there could be no doubt of it. It was water gushing from a tap.
Someone in the establishment was about to have a bath.</p>

<p>Then he slipped back to his room just in time. The someone was
approaching with light feet and a rustle of draperies. He had his
door shut when the steps passed, and then opened it and stuck his
head out. He saw a pink dressing-gown, and above it a slender
neck and masses of dark hair. It was the figure which he of all
men was likely to know best.</p>

<p>It seemed that the place for him was bed, so he got between
the sheets again and tried to think. Adela Victor was here;
therefore he was in the hands of her captors, and made a fourth
in their bag. But what insanity had prompted these wary criminals
to bring the two of them to the same prison? Were they so utterly
secure, so confident of their power, that they took this crazy
risk? The insolence of it made him furious. In the name of every
saint he swore that he would make them regret it. He would free
the lady and himself, though he had to burn down the house and
wring the neck of every inmate. And then he remembered the
delicacy of the business, and the need of exact timing if the
other two hostages were not to be lost, and at the thought he
groaned.</p>

<p>There was a tap at the door, and a man entered to clear away
the supper table. He seemed an ordinary English valet, with his
stiff collar and decent black coat and smug expressionless
face.</p>

<p>"Beg pardon, my lord," he said, "at what hour would you like
your shavin' water? Seein' it's been a late night I make so bold
as to suggest ten o'clock."</p>

<p>Turpin assented, and the servant had hardly gone when another
visitor appeared. It was a slim pale man, whom he was not
conscious of having seen before, a man with grey hair and a
melancholy droop of the head. He stood at the foot of the bed,
gazing upon the prostrate Turpin, and his look was friendly. Then
he addressed him in French of the most Saxon type.</p>

<p><i>"&Ecirc;tes-vous comfortable, monsieur? C'est bien. Soyez
tranquille. Nous sommes vos amis. Bon soir."</i></p>

<h1>OUR TIME IS NARROWED</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>I lunched that day with Mary--alone, for her aunts were both
in Paris--and it would have been hard to find in the confines of
the British islands a more dejected pair. Mary, who had always a
singular placid gentleness, showed her discomposure only by her
pallor. As for me I was as restless as a bantam.</p>

<p>"I wish I had never touched the thing," I cried. "I have done
more harm than good."</p>

<p>"You have found Lord Mercot," she protested.</p>

<p>"Yes, and lost Turpin. The brutes are still three up on us. We
thought we had found two, and now we have lost Miss Victor again.
And Turpin! They'll find him an ugly customer, and probably take
strong measures with him. They'll stick to him and the girl and
the little boy now like wax; for last night's performance is
bound to make them suspicious."</p>

<p>"I wonder," said Mary, always an optimist. "You see, Sir
Archie only dragged him in because of his rank. It looked odd his
being in Adela's company, but then all the times he has seen her
he never spoke a word to her. They must have noticed that. I'm
anxious about Sir Archie. He ought to leave London."</p>

<p>"Confound him! He's going to, as soon as he gets out of
hospital, which will probably be this afternoon. I insisted on
it, but he meant to in any case. He's heard an authentic report
of a green sandpiper nesting somewhere. It would be a good thing
if Archie would stick to birds. He has no head for anything else.
. . . And now we've got to start again at the beginning."</p>

<p>"Not quite the beginning," she interposed.</p>

<p>"Dashed near it. They won't bring Miss Victor into that kind
of world again, and all your work goes for nothing, my dear. It's
uncommon bad luck that you didn't begin to wake her up, for then
she might have done something on her own account. But she's still
a dummy, and tucked away, you may be sure, in some place where we
can never reach her. And we have little more than three weeks
left."</p>

<p>"It is bad luck," Mary agreed. "But, Dick, I've a feeling that
I haven't lost Adela Victor. I believe that somehow or other
we'll soon get in touch with her again. You remember how children
when they lose a ball sometimes send another one after it in the
hope that one will find the other. Well, we've sent the Marquis
after Adela, and I've a notion we may find them both together. We
always did that as children." . . . She paused at the word
'children' and I saw pain in her eyes. "Oh, Dick, the little boy!
We're no nearer him, and he's far the most tragic of all."</p>

<p>The whole business looked so black that I had no word of
comfort to give her.</p>

<p>"And to put the lid on it," I groaned, "I've got to settle
down in Medina's house this evening. I hate the idea like
poison."</p>

<p>"It's the safest way," she said.</p>

<p>"Yes, but it puts me out of action. He'll watch me like a
lynx, and I won't be able to take a single step on my own--simply
sit there and eat and drink and play up to his vanity. Great
Scott, I swear I'll have a row with him and break his head."</p>

<p>"Dick, you're not going to--how do you say it?--chuck in your
hand? Everything depends on you. You're our scout in the enemy's
headquarters. Your life depends on your playing the game. Colonel
Arbuthnot said so. And you may find out something tremendous. It
will be horrible for you, but it isn't for long, and it's the
only way."</p>

<p>That was Mary all over. She was trembling with anxiety for me,
but she was such a thorough sportsman that she wouldn't take any
soft option.</p>

<p>"You may hear something about David Warcliff," she added.</p>

<p>"I hope to God I do. Don't worry, darling. I'll stick it out.
But, look here, we must make a plan. I shall be more or less shut
off from the world, and I must have a line of communication open.
You can't telephone to me at that house, and I daren't ring you
up from there. The only chance is the Club. If you have any
message, ring up the head porter and make him write it down. I'll
arrange that he keeps it quiet, and I'll pick up the messages
when I get the chance. And I'll ring you up occasionally to give
you the news. But I must be jolly careful, for, likely as not,
Medina will keep an eye on me even there. You're in touch with
Macgillivray?"</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>"And with Sandy?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but it takes some time--a day at least. We can't
correspond direct."</p>

<p>"Well, there's the lay-out. I'm a prisoner--with
qualifications. You and I can keep up some sort of communication.
As you say, there's only about another three weeks."</p>

<p>"It would be nothing if only we had some hope."</p>

<p>"That's life, my dear. We've got to go on to the finish
anyhow, trusting that luck will turn in the last ten
minutes."</p>

<p>I arrived in Hill Street after tea and found Medina in the
back smoking-room, writing letters.</p>

<p>"Good man, Hannay," he said; "make yourself comfortable. There
are cigars on that table."</p>

<p>"Had a satisfactory time in Shropshire?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Rotten. I motored back this morning, starting very early.
Some tiresome business here wanted my attention. I'm sorry, but
I'll be out to dinner to-night. The same thing always happens
when I want to see my friends--a hideous rush of work."</p>

<p>He was very hospitable, but his manner had not the ease it
used to have. He seemed on the edge about something, and rather
preoccupied. I guessed it was the affair of Archie Roylance and
Turpin.</p>

<p>I dined alone and sat after dinner in the smoking-room, for
Odell never suggested the library, though I would have given a
lot to fossick about that place. I fell asleep over the
<i>Field</i> and was wakened about eleven by Medina. He looked
almost tired, a rare thing for him; also his voice was curiously
hard. He made some trivial remark about the weather, and a row in
the Cabinet which was going on. Then he said suddenly:</p>

<p>"Have you seen Arbuthnot lately?"</p>

<p>"No," I replied, with real surprise in my tone. "How could I?
He has gone back to the East."</p>

<p>"So I thought. But I have been told that he has been seen
again in England."</p>

<p>For a second I had a horrid fear that he had got on the track
of my meeting with Sandy at the Cotswold inn and his visit to
Fosse. His next words reassured me.</p>

<p>"Yes. In London. Within the last few days."</p>

<p>It was easy enough for me to show astonishment. "What a crazy
fellow he is! He can't stay put for a week together. All I can
say is that I hope he won't come my way. I've no particular wish
to see him again."</p>

<p>Medina said no more. He accompanied me to my bedroom, asked if
I had everything I wanted, bade me good night, and left me.</p>

<p>Now began one of the strangest weeks in my life. Looking back,
it has still the inconsequence of a nightmare, but one or two
episodes stand out like reefs in a tide-race. When I woke the
first morning under Medina's roof I believed that somehow or
other he had come to suspect me. I soon saw that that was
nonsense, that he regarded me as a pure chattel; but I saw, too,
that a most active suspicion of something had been awakened in
his mind. Probably Archie's fiasco, together with the news of
Sandy, had done it, and perhaps there was in it something of the
natural anxiety of a man nearing the end of a difficult course.
Anyhow I concluded that this tension of mind on his part was
bound to make things more difficult for me. Without suspecting
me, he kept me perpetually under his eye. He gave me orders as if
I were a child, or rather he made suggestions, which in my
character of worshipping disciple I had to treat as orders.</p>

<p>He was furiously busy night and day, and yet he left me no
time to myself. He wanted to know everything I did, and I had to
give an honest account of my doings, for I had a feeling that he
had ways of finding out the truth. One lie discovered would, I
knew, wreck my business utterly, for if I were under his power,
as he believed I was, it would be impossible for me to lie to
him. Consequently I dared not pay many visits to the Club, for he
would want to know what I did there. I was on such desperately
thin ice that I thought it best to stay most of my time in Hill
Street, unless he asked me to accompany him. I consulted Mary
about this, and she agreed that it was the wise course.</p>

<p>Apart from a flock of maids, there was no other servant in the
house but Odell. Twice I met the grey, sad-faced man on the
stairs, the man I had seen on my first visit, and had watched a
week before in the house behind the curiosity shop. I asked who
he was, and was told a private secretary, who helped Medina in
his political work. I gathered that he did not live regularly in
the house, but only came there when his services were
required.</p>

<p>Now Mary had said that the other man that evening in Little
Fardell Street had been Sandy. If she was right, this fellow
might be a friend, and I wondered if I could get in touch with
him. The first time I encountered him he never raised his eyes.
The second time I forced him by some question to look at me, and
he turned on me a perfectly dead expressionless face like a
codfish. I concluded that Mary had been in error, for this was
the genuine satellite, every feature of whose character had been
steam-rollered out of existence by Medina's will.</p>

<p>I was seeing Medina now at very close quarters, and in
complete undress, and the impression he had made on me at our
first meeting--which had been all overlaid by subsequent
happenings--grew as vivid again as daylight. The "good fellow,"
of course, had gone; I saw behind all his perfection of manner to
the naked ribs of his soul. He would talk to me late at night in
that awful library, till I felt that he and the room were one
presence, and that all the diabolic lore of the ages had been
absorbed by this one mortal. You must understand that there was
nothing wrong in the ordinary sense with anything he said. If
there had been a phonograph recording his talk it could have been
turned on with perfect safety in a girls' school. . . . He never
spoke foully, or brutally. I don't believe he had a shadow of
those faults of the flesh which we mean when we use the word
"vice." But I swear that the most wretched libertine before the
bar of the Almighty would have shown a clean sheet compared to
his.</p>

<p>I know no word to describe how he impressed me except
"wickedness." He seemed to annihilate the world of ordinary moral
standards, all the little rags of honest impulse and stumbling
kindness with which we try to shelter ourselves from the winds of
space. His consuming egotism made life a bare cosmos in which his
spirit scorched like a flame. I have met bad men in my day,
fellows who ought to have been quietly and summarily put out of
existence, but if I had had the trying of them I would have found
bits of submerged decency and stunted remnants of good feeling.
At any rate they were human, and their beastliness was a
degeneration of humanity, not its flat opposite. Medina made an
atmosphere which was like a cold bright air in which nothing can
live. He was utterly and consumedly wicked, with no standard
which could be remotely related to ordinary life. That is why, I
suppose, mankind has had to invent the notion of devils. He
seemed to be always lifting the corner of a curtain and giving me
peeps into a hoary mystery of iniquity older than the stars. . .
. I suppose that someone who had never felt his hypnotic power
would have noticed very little in his talk except its audacious
cleverness, and that someone wholly under his dominion would have
been less impressed than me because he would have forgotten his
own standards, and been unable to make the comparison. I was just
in the right position to understand and tremble. . . . Oh, I can
tell you, I used to go to bed solemnised, frightened half out of
my wits, and yet in a violent revulsion, and hating him like
hell. It was pretty clear that he was mad, for madness means just
this dislocation of the modes of thought which mortals have
agreed upon as necessary to keep the world together. His head
used to seem as round as a bullet, like nothing you find even in
the skulls of cave-men, and his eyes to have a blue light in them
like the sunrise of death in an arctic waste.</p>

<p>One day I had a very narrow escape. I went to the Club, to see
if there was anything from Mary, and received instead a long
cable from Gaudian in Norway. I had just opened it, when I found
Medina at my elbow. He had seen me enter, and followed me, in
order that we should walk home together.</p>

<p>Now I had arranged a simple code with Gaudian for his cables,
and by the mercy of Heaven that honest fellow had taken special
precautions, and got some friend to send this message from
Christiania. Had it borne the Merdal stamp it would have been all
up with me.</p>

<p>The only course was the bold one, though I pursued it with a
quaking heart.</p>

<p>"Hullo," I cried, "here's a cable from a pal of mine in
Norway. Did I tell you I had been trying to get a beat on the
Leardal for July? I had almost forgotten about the thing. I
started inquiring in March, and here's my first news."</p>

<p>I handed him the two sheets and he glanced at the place of
dispatch.</p>

<p>"Code," he said. "Do you want to work it out now?"</p>

<p>"If you don't mind waiting a few seconds. It's a simple code
of my own invention, and I ought to be able to decipher it pretty
fast."</p>

<p>We sat down at one of the tables in the hall, and I took up a
pen and a sheet of notepaper. As I think I have mentioned before,
I am rather a swell at codes, and this one in particular I could
read without much difficulty. I jotted down some letters and
numbers, and then wrote out a version which I handed to Medina.
This was what he read:</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Upper beat Leardal available from first of month. Rent two
hundred and fifty with option of August at one hundred more. No
limit to rods. Boat on each pool. Tidal waters can also be got
for sea trout by arrangement. If you accept please cable word
'Yes.' You should arrive not later than June 29th. Bring plenty
of bottled prawns. Motor boat can be had from Bergen. Andersen,
Grand Hotel, Christiania."</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>But all the time I was scribbling this nonsense, I was reading
the code correctly and getting the message by heart. Here is what
Gaudian really sent:</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Our friend has quarrelled with keeper and beaten him soundly.
I have taken charge at farm and frightened latter into docility.
He will remain prisoner in charge of ally of mine till I give the
word to release. Meantime, think it safer to bring friend to
England and start on Monday. Will wire address in Scotland and
wait your instructions. No danger of keeper sending message. Do
not be anxious, all is well."</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>Having got that clear in my head, I tore the cable into small
pieces and flung them into the waste-paper basket.</p>

<p>"Well, are you going?" Medina asked.</p>

<p>"Not I. I'm off salmon-fishing for the present." I took a
cable form from the table and wrote: "Sorry, must cancel Leardal
plan," signed it "Hannay," addressed it to "Andersen, Grand
Hotel, Christiania," and gave it to the porter to send off. I
wonder what happened to that telegram. It is probably still stuck
up on the hotel-board, awaiting the arrival of the mythical
Andersen.</p>

<p>On our way back to Hill Street Medina put his arm in mine, and
was very friendly. "I hope to get a holiday," he said, "perhaps
just after the beginning of June. Only a day or two off now. I
may go abroad for a little. I would like you to come with
me."</p>

<p>That puzzled me a lot. Medina could not possibly leave town
before the great liquidation, and there could be no motive in his
trying to mislead me on such a point, seeing that I was living in
his house. I wondered if something had happened to make him
change the date. It was of the first importance that I should
find this out, and I did my best to draw him about his plans. But
I could get nothing out of him except that he hoped for an early
holiday, and "early" might apply to the middle of June as well as
to the beginning, for it was now the 27th of May.</p>

<p>Next afternoon at tea-time to my surprise Odell appeared in
the smoking-room, followed by the long lean figure of Tom
Greenslade. I never saw anybody with greater pleasure, but I
didn't dare to talk to him alone. "Is your master upstairs?" I
asked the butler. "Will you tell him that Dr. Greenslade is here?
He is an old friend of his."</p>

<p>We had rather less than two minutes before Medina appeared. "I
come from your wife," Greenslade whispered. "She has told me all
about the business, and she thought this was the safest plan. I
was to tell you that she has news of Miss Victor and the Marquis.
They are safe enough. Any word of the little boy?"</p>

<p>He raised his voice as Medina entered. "My dear fellow, this
is a great pleasure. I had to be in London for a consultation,
and I thought I would look up Hannay. I hardly hoped to have the
luck to catch a busy man like you."</p>

<p>Medina was very gracious--no, that is not the word, for there
was nothing patronising in his manner. He asked in the most
friendly way about Greenslade's practice, and how he liked
English country life after his many wanderings. He spoke with an
air of regret of the great valleys of loess and the windy Central
Asian tablelands where they had first foregathered. Odell brought
in tea, and we made as pleasant a trio of friends as you could
find in London. I asked a few casual questions about Fosse, and
then I mentioned Peter John. Here Greenslade had an inspiration;
he told me afterwards that he thought it might be a good thing to
open a channel for further communications.</p>

<p>"I think he's all right," he said slowly. "He's been having
occasional stomach-aches, but I expect that is only the result of
hot weather and the first asparagus. Lady Hannay is a little
anxious--you know what she is, and all mothers to-day keep
thinking about appendicitis. So I'm keeping my eye on the little
man. You needn't worry, Dick."</p>

<p>I take credit to myself for having divined the doctor's
intention. I behaved as if I scarcely heard him, and as if Fosse
Manor and my family were things infinitely remote. Indeed I
switched off the conversation to where Medina had last left it,
and I behaved towards Tom Greenslade as if his presence rather
bored me, and I had very little to say to him. When he got up to
go, it was Medina who accompanied him to the front door. All this
was a heavy strain upon my self-command, for I would have given
anything for a long talk with him--though I had the sense not to
believe his news about Peter John.</p>

<p>"Not a bad fellow, that doctor of yours," Medina observed on
his return.</p>

<p>"No," I said carelessly. "Rather a dull dog all the same, with
his country gossip. But I wish him well, for it is to him that I
owe your friendship."</p>

<p>I must count that episode one of my lucky moments, for it
seemed to give Medina some special satisfaction. "Why do you make
this your only sitting-room?" he asked. "The library is at your
disposal, and it is pleasanter in summer than any other part of
the house."</p>

<p>"I thought I might be disturbing your work," I said
humbly.</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it. Besides, I've nearly finished my work. After
to-night I can slack off, and presently I'll be an idle man."</p>

<p>"And then the holiday?"</p>

<p>"Then the holiday." He smiled in a pleasant boyish way, which
was one of his prettiest tricks.</p>

<p>"How soon will that be?"</p>

<p>"If all goes well, very soon. Probably after the second of
June. By the way, the Thursday Club dines on the first. I want
you to be my guest again."</p>

<p>Here was more food for thought. The conviction grew upon me
that he and his friends had put forward the date of liquidation;
they must have suspected something--probably from Sandy's
presence in England--and were taking no risks. I smoked that
evening till my tongue was sore and went to bed in a fever of
excitement. The urgency of the matter fairly screamed in my ears,
for Macgillivray must know the truth at once, and so must Mary.
Mercot was safe, and there was a chance apparently of Turpin and
Miss Victor, which must be acted upon instantly if the main date
were changed. Of the little boy I had given up all hope. . . .
But how to find the truth! I felt like a man in a bad dream who
is standing on the line with an express train approaching, and
does not know how to climb back on to the platform.</p>

<p>Next morning Medina never left me. He took me in his car to
the City, and I waited while he did his business, and then to
call in Carlton House Terrace a few doors from the Victors'
house. I believe it was the residence of the man who led his
party in the Lords. After luncheon he solemnly installed me in
the library. "You're not much of a reader, and in any case you
would probably find my books dull. But there are excellent
arm-chairs to doze in."</p>

<p>Then he went out and I heard the wheels of his car move away.
I felt a kind of awe creeping over me when I found myself left
alone in the uncanny place, which I knew to be the devil's
kitchen for all his schemes. There was a telephone on his
writing-table, the only one I had seen in the house, though there
was no doubt one in the butler's pantry. I turned up the
telephone book and found a number given, but it was not the one
on the receiver. This must be a private telephone, by means of
which he could ring up anybody he wanted, but of which only his
special friends knew the number. There was nothing else in the
room to interest me, except the lines and lines of books, for his
table was as bare as a bank-manager's.</p>

<p>I tried the books, but most of them were a long sight too
learned for me. Most were old, and many were in Latin, and some
were evidently treasures, for I would take one down and find it a
leather box with inside it a slim battered volume wrapped in
wash-leather. But I found in one corner a great array of works of
travel, so I selected one of Aurel Stein's books and settled down
in an arm-chair with it. I tried to fix my attention, but found
it impossible. The sentences would not make sense to my restless
mind, and I could not follow the maps. So I got up again,
replaced the work on its shelf, and began to wander about. It was
a dull close day, and out in the street a water-cart was
sprinkling the dust and children were going park-wards with their
nurses. . . . I simply could not account for my disquiet, but I
was like a fine lady with the vapours. I felt that somewhere in
that room there was something that it concerned me deeply to
know.</p>

<p>I drifted towards the bare writing-table. There was nothing on
it but a massive silver inkstand in the shape of an owl, a silver
tray of pens and oddments, a leather case of notepaper and a big
blotting-book. I would never have made a good thief, for I felt
both nervous and ashamed as, after listening for steps, I tried
the drawers.</p>

<p>They were all locked--all, that is, except a shallow one at
the top which looked as if it were meant to contain one of those
big engagement tablets which busy men affect. There was no tablet
there, but there were two sheets of paper.</p>

<p>Both had been torn from a loose-leaf diary, and both covered
the same dates--the fortnight between Monday the 29th of May, and
Sunday the 11th of June. In the first the space for the days was
filled with entries in Medina's neat writing, entries in some
sort of shorthand. These entries were close and thick up to and
including Friday the 2nd of June; after that there was nothing.
The second sheet of paper was just the opposite. The spaces were
virgin up to and including the 2nd of June; after that, on till
the 11th, they were filled with notes.</p>

<p>As I stared at these two sheets, some happy instinct made me
divine their meaning. The first sheet contained the steps that
Medina would take up to the day of liquidation, which was clearly
the 2nd of June. After that, if all went well, came peace and
leisure. But if it didn't go well, the second sheet contained his
plans--plans I have no doubt for using the hostages, for wringing
safety out of certain great men's fears. . . . My interpretation
was confirmed by a small jotting in long-hand on the first sheet
in the space for 2nd June. It was the two words <i>"Dies
irae,"</i> which my Latin was just good enough to construe.</p>

<p>I had lost all my tremors now, but I was a thousandfold more
restless. I must get word to Macgillivray at once--no, that was
too dangerous--to Mary. I glanced at the telephone and resolved
to trust my luck.</p>

<p>I got through to the Wymondhams' house without difficulty.
Barnard the butler answered, and informed me that Mary was at
home. Then after a few seconds I heard her voice.</p>

<p>"Mary," I said, "the day is changed to the 2nd of June. You
understand, warn everybody . . . I can't think why you are
worrying about that child."</p>

<p>For I was conscious that Medina was entering the room. I
managed with my knee to close the shallow drawer with the two
sheets in it, and I nodded and smiled to him, putting my hand
over the receiver.</p>

<p>"Forgive me using your telephone. Fact is, my wife's in London
and she sent me round a note here asking me to ring her up. She's
got the boy on her mind."</p>

<p>I put the tube to my ear again. Mary's voice sounded sharp and
high-pitched.</p>

<p>"Are you there? I'm in Mr. Medina's library and I can't
disturb him talking through this machine. There's no cause to
worry about Peter John. Greenslade is usually fussy enough, and
if he's calm there's no reason why you shouldn't be. But if you
want another opinion, why not get it? We may as well get the
thing straightened out now, for I may be going abroad early in
June. . . . Yes, some time after the 2nd."</p>

<p>Thank God Mary was quick-witted.</p>

<p>"The 2nd is very near. Why do you make such sudden plans,
Dick? I can't go home without seeing you. I think I'll come
straight to Hill Street."</p>

<p>"All right," I said, "do as you please." I rang off and looked
at Medina with a wry smile. "What fussers women are! Do you mind
if my wife comes round here? She won't be content till she has
seen me. She has come up with a crazy notion of taking down a
surgeon to give an opinion on the child's appendix. Tommy rot!
But that's a woman's way."</p>

<p>He clearly suspected nothing. "Certainly let Lady Hannay come
here. We'll give her tea. I'm sorry that the drawing-room is out
of commission just now. She might have liked to see my
miniatures."</p>

<p>Mary appeared in ten minutes, and most nobly she acted her
part. It was the very model of a distraught silly mother who
bustled into the room. Her eyes looked as if she had been crying
and she had managed to disarrange her hat and untidy her
hair.</p>

<p>"Oh, I've been so worried," she wailed, after she had murmured
apologies to Medina. "He really has had a bad tummy pain, and
nurse thought last night that he was feverish. I've seen Mr.
Dobson-Wray, and he can come down by the four-forty-five. . . .
He's such a precious little boy, Mr. Medina, that I feel we must
take every precaution with him. If Mr. Dobson-Wray says it is all
right, I promise not to fuss any more. I think a second opinion
would please Dr. Greenslade, for he too looked rather anxious. .
. . Oh, no, thank you so much, but I can't stay for tea. I have a
taxi waiting, and I might miss my train. I'm going to pick up Mr.
Dobson-Wray in Wimpole Street."</p>

<p>She departed in the same tornado in which she had come, just
stopping to set her hat straight at one of the mirrors in the
hall.</p>

<p>"Of course I'll wire when the surgeon has seen him. And, Dick,
you'll come down at once if there's anything wrong, and bring
nurses. Poor, poor little darling! . . . Did you say after the
2nd of June, Dick? I do hope you'll be able to get off. You need
a holiday away from your tiresome family. . . . Good-bye, Mr.
Medina. It was so kind of you to be patient with a silly mother.
Look after Dick and don't let him worry."</p>

<p>I had preserved admirably the aloof air of the bored and
slightly ashamed husband. But now I realised that Mary was not
babbling at large, but was saying something which I was meant to
take in.</p>

<p>"Poor, poor little darling!" she crooned as she got into the
taxi. "I do pray he'll be all right--I <i>think</i> he may, Dick.
. . . I hope, oh I hope . . . to put your mind at ease . . .
before the 2nd of June."</p>

<p>As I turned back to Medina I had a notion that the poor little
darling was no longer Peter John.</p>

<h1><a name="c17">CHAPTER XVII</a></h1>

<h1>THE DISTRICT-VISITOR IN PALMYRA SQUARE</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>During the last fortnight a new figure had begun to appear in
Palmyra Square. I do not know if Macgillivray's watchers reported
its presence, for I saw none of their reports, but they must have
been cognisant of it, unless they spent all their time in the
nearest public-house. It was a district-visitor of the familiar
type--a woman approaching middle age, presumably a spinster, who
wore a plain black dress and, though the weather was warm, a
cheap fur round her neck, and carried a rather old black silk
satchel. Her figure was good, and had still a suggestion of
youth, but her hair, which was dressed very flat and tight and
coiled behind in an unfashionable bun, seemed--the little that
was seen of it--to be sprinkled with grey. She was dowdy, and yet
not altogether dowdy, for there was a certain faded elegance in
her air, and an observer might have noted that she walked well.
Besides the black satchel she carried usually a sheaf of papers,
and invariably and in all weathers a cheap badly-rolled
umbrella.</p>

<p>She visited at the doctor's house with the brass plate, and
the music-teacher's, and at the various lodging-houses. She was
attached, it appeared, to the big church of St. Jude's a quarter
of a mile off, which had just got a new and energetic vicar. She
was full of enthusiasm for her vicar, praised his earnestness and
his eloquence, and dwelt especially, after the way of elderly
maiden ladies, on the charm of his youth. She was also very ready
to speak of herself, and eager to explain that her work was
voluntary--she was a gentlewoman of modest but independent means,
and had rooms in Hampstead, and her father had been a clergyman
at Eastbourne. Very full of her family she was to those who would
hear her. There was a gentle simplicity about her manners, and an
absence of all patronage, which attracted people and made them
willing to listen to her when they would have shut the door on
another, for the inhabitants of Palmyra Square are not a
courteous or patient or religious folk.</p>

<p>Her aim was to enlist the overworked general servants of the
Square in some of the organisations of St. Jude's. There were all
kinds of activities in that enlightened church--choral societies,
and mothers' meetings, and country holiday clubs, and classes for
adult education. She would hand out sheaves of literature about
the Girls' Friendly Society, and the Mothers' Union, and
such-like, and try to secure a promise of attendance at some of
the St. Jude's functions. I do not think she had much success at
the doctor's and the music-teacher's, though she regularly
distributed her literature there. The wretched little maids were
too downtrodden and harassed to do more than listen dully on the
doorstep and say "Yes'm." Nor was she allowed to see the
mistresses, except one of the lodging-house keepers, who was a
Primitive Methodist and considered St. Jude's a device of Satan.
But she had better fortune with the maid at No. 4.</p>

<p>The girl belonged to a village in Kent, and the
district-visitor, it seemed, had been asked to look her up by the
rector of her old parish. She was a large flat-faced young woman,
slow of speech, heavy of movement, and suspicious of nature. At
first she greeted the district-visitor coldly, but thawed at the
mention of familiar names and accepted a copy of the St. Jude's
Magazine. Two days later, when on her afternoon out, she met the
district-visitor and consented to walk a little way with her. Now
the girl's hobby was dress, and her taste was better than most of
her class and aspired to higher things. She had a new hat which
her companion admired, but she confessed that she was not quite
satisfied with it. The district-visitor revealed a knowledge of
fashions which one would have scarcely augured from her own
sombre clothes. She pointed out where the trimming was wrong, and
might easily be improved, and the girl--her name was Elsie
Outhwaite--agreed. "I could put it right for you in ten minutes,"
she was told. "Perhaps you would let me come and see you when you
have a spare half-hour, and we could do it together. I'm rather
clever at hats, and used to help my sisters."</p>

<p>The ice was broken and the aloof Miss Outhwaite became
confidential. She liked her place, had no cause to complain,
received good wages, and above all was not fussed. "I minds my
own business, and Madame minds 'ers," she said. Madame was a
foreigner, and had her queer ways, but had also her good points.
She did not interfere unnecessarily, and was not mean. There were
handsome presents at Christmas, and every now and then the house
would be shut up and Miss Outhwaite returned to Kent on generous
board wages. It was not a hard billet, though of course there
were a lot of visitors, Madame's clients. "She's a massoose, you
know, but very respectable." When asked if there were no other
inmates of the house she became reticent. "Not what you would
call reg'lar part of the family," she admitted. "There's an old
lady, Madame's aunt, that stops with us a but, but I don't see
much of 'er. Madame attends to 'er 'erself, and she 'as her
private room. And of course there's . . ." Miss Outhwaite seemed
suddenly to recollect something, and changed the subject.</p>

<p>The district-visitor professed a desire to make Madame's
acquaintance, but was not encouraged. "She's not the sort for the
likes of you. She don't 'old with churches and God and
such-like--I've 'eard 'er say so. You won't be getting 'er near
St. Jude's, miss."</p>

<p>"But if she is so clever and nice I would like to meet her.
She could advise me about some of the difficult questions in this
big parish. Perhaps she would help with our Country
Holidays."</p>

<p>Miss Outhwaite primmed her lips and didn't think so. "You've
got to be ill and nervy for Madame to have an interest in you.
I'll take in your name if you like, but I expect Madame won't be
at 'ome to you."</p>

<p>It was eventually arranged that the district-visitor should
call at No. 4 the following afternoon and bring the materials for
the reconstructed hat. She duly presented herself, but was warned
away by a flustered Miss Outhwaite. "We're that busy to-day I
'aven't a minute to myself." Sunday was suggested, but it
appeared that that was the day when the district-visitor was
fully occupied, so a provisional appointment was made for the
next Tuesday evening.</p>

<p>This time all went well. Madame was out, and the
district-visitor spent a profitable hour in Miss Outhwaite's
room. Her nimble fingers soon turned the hat, purchased in
Queen's Crescent for ten and sixpence, into a distant imitation
of a costlier mode. She displayed an innocent interest in the
household, and asked many questions which Miss Outhwaite, now in
the best of tempers, answered readily. She was told of Madame's
habits, her very occasional shortness of temper, her love of
every tongue but English. "The worst of them furriners," said
Miss Outhwaite, "is that you can't never be sure what they thinks
of you. Half the time I'm with Madame and her aunt they're
talking some 'eathen language."</p>

<p>As she departed the district-visitor was given a sketch of the
topography of the house about which she showed an unexpected
curiosity. Before she left there was a slight <i>contretemps.</i>
Madame's latch-key was heard in the door and Miss Outhwaite had a
moment of panic. "Here, miss, I'll let you out through the
kitchen," she whispered. But her visitor showed no embarrassment.
"I'd like to meet Madame Breda," she declared. "This is a good
chance."</p>

<p>Madame's plump dark face showed surprise, and possibly
annoyance, as she observed the two. Miss Outhwaite hastened to
explain the situation with a speed which revealed nervousness.
"This is a lady from St. Jude's, Madame," she said. "She comes
'ere districk-visiting and she knows the folk in Radhurst, where
I comes from, so I made bold to ask her in."</p>

<p>"I am very glad to meet you, Madame Breda," said the
district-visitor. "I hope you don't mind my calling on Elsie
Outhwaite. I want her to help in our Girls' Friendly Society
work."</p>

<p>"You have been here before, I think," was the reply in a
sufficiently civil tone. "I have seen you in the Square
sometimes. There is no objection on my part to Outhwaite's
attending your meetings, but I warn you that she has very little
free time." The woman was a foreigner, no doubt, but on this
occasion her English showed little trace of accent.</p>

<p>"That is very good of you. I should have asked your permission
first, but you were unfortunately not at home when I called, and
Elsie and I made friends by accident. I hope you will let me come
again."</p>

<p>As the visitor descended the steps and passed through the
bright green gate into the gathering dusk of the Square, Madame
Breda watched her contemplatively from one of the windows.</p>

<p>The lady came again four days later--it must, I think, have
been the 29th of May. Miss Outhwaite, when she opened the door,
looked flustered. "I can't talk to you to-night, miss. Madame's
orders is that when you next came you was to be shown in to her
room."</p>

<p>"How very kind of her!" said the lady. "I should greatly enjoy
a talk with her. And, Elsie--I've got such a nice present for
you--a hat which a friend gave me and which is too young--really
too young--for me to wear. I'm going to give it you, if you'll
accept it. I'll bring it in a day or two."</p>

<p>The district-visitor was shown into the large room on the
right-hand side of the hall where Madame received her patients.
There was no one there except a queer-looking little girl in a
linen smock, who beckoned her to follow to the folding-doors
which divided the apartment from the other at the back. The lady
did a strange thing, for she picked up the little girl, held her
a second in her arms, and kissed her--after the emotional habit
of the childless <i>d&eacute;vote.</i> Then she passed through
the folding-doors.</p>

<p>It was an odd apartment in which she found herself--much
larger than could have been guessed from the look of the house,
and, though the night was warm, there was a fire lit, a
smouldering fire which gave off a fine blue smoke. Madame Breda
was there, dressed in a low-cut gown as if she had been dining
out, and looking handsome and dark and very foreign in the light
of the shaded lamps. In an armchair by the hearth sat a wonderful
old lady, with a thing like a mantilla over her snow-white hair.
It was a room so unlike anything in her narrow experience that
the newcomer stood hesitating as the folding-doors shut behind
her.</p>

<p>"Oh, Madame Breda, it is so very kind of you to see me," she
faltered.</p>

<p>"I do not know your name," Madame said, and then she did a
curious thing, for she lifted a lamp and held it in the visitor's
face, scrutinising every line of her shabby figure.</p>

<p>"Clarke--Agnes Clarke. I am the eldest of three sisters--the
other two are married--you may have heard of my father--he wrote
some beautiful hymns, and edited--"</p>

<p>"How old are you?" Madame broke in, still holding up the
lamp.</p>

<p>The district-visitor gave a small nervous laugh. "Oh, I am not
so very old--just over forty--well, to be quite truthful, nearly
forty-seven. I feel so young sometimes that I cannot believe it,
and then--at other times--when I am tired--I feel a hundred.
Alas! I have many useless years behind me. But then we all have,
don't you think? The great thing is to be resolved to make the
most of every hour that remains to us. Mr. Empson at St. Jude's
preached such a beautiful sermon last Sunday about that. He said
we must give every unforgiving minute its sixty seconds' worth of
distance run--I think he was quoting poetry. It is terrible to
think of unforgiving minutes."</p>

<p>Madame did not appear to be listening. She said something to
the older lady in a foreign tongue.</p>

<p>"May I sit down, please?" the visitor asked. "I have been
walking a good deal to-day."</p>

<p>Madame waved her away from the chair she seemed about to take.
"You will sit there, if you please," she said, pointing to a low
couch beside the old woman.</p>

<p>The visitor was obviously embarrassed. She sat down on the
edge of the couch, a faded nervous figure compared to the two
masterful personages, and her fingers played uneasily with the
handle of her satchel.</p>

<p>"Why do you come to this house?" Madame asked, and her tone
was almost menacing. "We have nothing to do with your
church."</p>

<p>"Oh, but you live in the parish, and it's such a large and
difficult parish, and we want help from everyone. You cannot
imagine how horrible some of the slums are--what bitter poverty
in these bad times--and the worn-out mothers and the poor little
neglected children. We are trying to make it a brighter
place."</p>

<p>"Do you want money?"</p>

<p>"We always want money." The district-visitor's face wore an
ingratiating smile. "But we want chiefly personal service. Mr.
Empson always says that one little bit of personal service is
better than a large subscription--better for the souls of the
giver and the receiver."</p>

<p>"What do you expect to get from Outhwaite?"</p>

<p>"She is a young girl from a country village and alone in
London. She is a good girl, I think, and I want to give her
friends and innocent amusement. And I want her help too in our
work."</p>

<p>The visitor started, for she found the hand of the old woman
on her arm. The long fingers were running down it and pressing
it. Hitherto the owner of the hand had not spoken, but now she
said:</p>

<p>"This is the arm of a young woman. She has lied about her age.
No woman of forty-seven ever had such an arm."</p>

<p>The soft passage of the fingers had suddenly become a grip of
steel, and the visitor cried out.</p>

<p>"Oh, please, please, you are hurting me. . . . I do not tell
lies. I am proud of my figure--just a little. It is like my
mother's, and she was so pretty. But oh! I am not young. I wish I
was. I'm afraid I'm quite old when you see me by daylight."</p>

<p>The grip had relaxed, and the visitor moved along the couch to
be out of its reach. She had begun to cry in a helpless silly
way, as if she were frightened. The two other women spoke to each
other in a strange tongue, and then Madame said:</p>

<p>"I will not have you come here. I will not have you meddle
with my servants. I do not care a fig for your church. If you
come here again you will repent it."</p>

<p>Her tone was harsh, and the visitor looked as if her tears
would begin again. Her discomposure had deprived her of the faded
grace which had been in her air before, and she was now a
pathetic and flimsy creature, like some elderly governess
pleading against dismissal.</p>

<p>"You are cruel," she sighed. "I am so sorry if I have done
anything wrong, but I meant it for the best. I thought that you
might help me, for Elsie said you were clever and kind. Won't you
think of poor Elsie? She is so young and far from her people.
Mayn't she come to St. Jude's sometimes?"</p>

<p>"Outhwaite has her duties at home, and so I dare say have you,
if truth was spoken. Bah! I have no patience with restless
English old maids. They say an Englishman's house is his castle,
and yet there is a plague of barren virgins always buzzing round
it in the name of religion and philanthropy. Listen to me. I will
not have you in this house. I will not have you talking to
Outhwaite. I will not have an idle woman spying on my private
affairs."</p>

<p>The visitor dabbed her eyes with a wisp of handkerchief. The
old woman had stretched out her hand again and would have laid it
on her breast, but she had started up violently. She seemed to be
in a mood between distress and fear. She swallowed hard before
her voice came, and then it quavered.</p>

<p>"I think I had better go. You have wounded me very deeply. I
know I'm not clever, but I try so hard . . . and . . . and--it
pains me to be misunderstood. I am afraid I have been tactless,
so please forgive me . . . I won't come again . . . I'll pray
that your hearts may some day be softened."</p>

<p>She seemed to make an effort to regain composure, and with a
final dab at her eyes smiled shakily at the unrelenting Madame,
who had touched an electric bell. She closed the folding-doors
gently behind her, like a repentant child who has been sent to
bed. The front room was in darkness, but there was a light in the
hall where Miss Outhwaite waited to show her out.</p>

<p>At the front door the district-visitor had recovered
herself.</p>

<p>"Elsie," she whispered, "Madame Breda does not want me to come
again. But I must give you the hat I promised you. I'll have it
ready by Thursday night. I'm afraid I may be rather late--after
eleven perhaps--but don't go to bed till I come. I'll go round to
the back door. It's such a smart pretty hat. I know you'll love
it."</p>

<p>Once in the Square she looked sharply about her, cast a glance
back at No. 4, and then walked away briskly. There was a man
lounging at the corner to whom she spoke; he nodded and touched
his hat, and a big motor car, which had been waiting in the
shadows on the other side, drew up at the kerb. It seemed a
strange conveyance for the district-visitor, but she entered it
as if she were used to it, and when it moved off it was not in
the direction of her rooms in Hampstead.</p>

<h1><a name="c18">CHAPTER XVIII</a></h1>

<h1>THE NIGHT OF THE FIRST OF JUNE</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>The last two days of May were spent by me in the most
miserable restlessness and despondency. I was cut off from all
communications with my friends and I did not see how I could
reopen them. For Medina, after his late furious busyness, seemed
to have leisure again, and he simply never let me out of his
sight. I dare say I might have managed a visit to the Club and a
telephone message to Mary, but I durst not venture it, for I
realised as I had never done before how delicate was the ground I
walked on and how one false step on my part might blow everything
sky-high. It would have mattered less if I had been hopeful of
success, but a mood of black pessimism had seized me. I could
count on Mary passing on my news to Macgillivray and on
Macgillivray's taking the necessary steps to hasten the
rounding-up; by the second of June Mercot would be restored to
his friends, and Miss Victor too, if Mary had got on her track
again. But who was arranging all that? Was Mary alone in the
business, and where was Sandy? Mercot and Gaudian would be
arriving in Scotland, and telegraphing to me any moment, and I
could not answer them. I had the maddening feeling that
everything was on a knife edge, that the chances of a blunder
were infinite, and that I could do nothing. To crown all, I was
tortured by the thought of David Warcliff. I had come to the
conclusion that Mary's farewell words at Hill Street had meant
nothing: indeed, I couldn't see how she could have found out
anything about the little boy, for as yet we had never hit on the
faintest clue, and the thought of him made success with the other
two seem no better than failure. Likewise I was paying the
penalty for the assurance about Medina which I had rashly
expressed to Mary. I felt the terror of the man in a new way; he
seemed to me impregnable beyond the hope of assault; and while I
detested him I also shuddered at him--a novel experience, for
hitherto I had always found that hatred drove out fear.</p>

<p>He was abominable during those two days--abominable but also
wonderful. He seemed to love the sight of me, as if I were a
visible and intimate proof of his power, and he treated me as an
Oriental tyrant might treat a favourite slave. He unbent to me as
a relief to his long spiritual tension, and let me see the
innermost dreams of his heart. I realised with a shudder that he
thought me a part of that hideous world he had created, and--I
think for the first time in the business--I knew fear on my own
account. If he dreamed I could fail him he would become a
ravening beast. . . . I remember that he talked a good deal of
politics, but, ye gods! what a change from the respectable
conservative views which he had once treated me to--a Tory
revival owing to the women and that sort of thing! He declared
that behind all the world's creeds, Christianity, Buddhism, Islam
and the rest, lay an ancient devil-worship and that it was
raising its head again. Bolshevism, he said, was a form of it,
and he attributed the success of Bolshevism in Asia to a revival
of what he called Shamanism--I think that was the word. By his
way of it the War had cracked the veneer everywhere and the real
stuff was showing through. He rejoiced in the prospect, because
the old faiths were not ethical codes but mysteries of the
spirit, and they gave a chance for men who had found the ancient
magic. I think he wanted to win everything that civilisation
would give him, and then wreck it, for his hatred of Britain was
only a part of his hatred of all that most men hold in love and
repute. The common anarchist was a fool to him, for the cities
and temples of the whole earth were not sufficient sacrifice to
appease his vanity. I knew now what a Goth and a Hun meant, and
what had been the temper of scourges like Attila and Timour. . .
. Mad, you will say. Yes, mad beyond doubt, but it was the most
convincing kind of madness. I had to fight hard by keeping my
mind firm on my job, to prevent my nerve giving.</p>

<p>I went to bed on the last night of May in something very near
despair, comforting myself, I remember, by what I had said to
Mary, that one must go on to the finish and trust to luck
changing in the last ten minutes. I woke to a gorgeous morning,
and when I came down to breakfast I was in a shade better
spirits. Medina proposed a run out into the country and a walk on
some high ground. "It will give us an appetite for the Thursday
dinner," he said. Then he went upstairs to telephone, and I was
in the smoking-room filling my pipe when suddenly Greenslade was
shown in.</p>

<p>I didn't listen to what he had to say, but seized a sheet of
paper and scribbled a note: "Take this to the head porter at the
Club and he will give you any telegram there is for me. If there
is one from Gaudian, as there must be, wire him to start at once
and go straight to Julius Victor. Then wire the Duke to meet him
there. Do you understand? Now, what have you to tell me?"</p>

<p>"Only that your wife says things are going pretty well. You
must turn up to-night at ten-thirty at the Fields of Eden. Also
somehow you must get a latch-key for this house, and see that the
door is not chained."</p>

<p>"Nothing more?"</p>

<p>"Nothing more."</p>

<p>"And Peter John?"</p>

<p>Greenslade was enlarging on Peter John's case when Medina
entered. "I came round to tell Sir Richard that it was all a
false alarm. Only the spring fret. The surgeon was rather cross
at being taken so far on a fool's errand. Lady Hannay thought he
had better hear it from me personally, for then he could start on
his holiday with an easy mind."</p>

<p>I was so short with him that Medina must have seen how far my
thoughts were from my family. As we motored along the road to
Tring I talked of the approaching holiday, like a toadying
schoolboy who has been asked to stay for a cricket week with some
senior. Medina said he had not fixed the place, but it must be
somewhere south in the sun--Algiers, perhaps, and the fringes of
the desert, or better still some remote Mediterranean spot where
we could have both sunlight and blue sea. He talked of the sun
like a fire-worshipper. He wanted to steep his limbs in it, and
wash his soul in light, and swim in wide warm waters. He
rhapsodised like a poet, but what struck me about his rhapsodies
was how little sensuous they were. The man's body was the most
obedient satellite of his mind, and I don't believe he had any
weakness of the flesh. What he wanted was a bath of radiance for
his spirit.</p>

<p>We walked all day on the hills around Ivinghoe, and had a late
lunch in the village inn. He spoke very little, but strode over
the thymy downs with his eyes abstracted. Once, as we sat on the
summit, he seemed to sigh and his face for a moment was very
grave.</p>

<p>"What is the highest pleasure?" he asked suddenly.
"Attainment? . . . No. Renunciation."</p>

<p>"So I've heard the parsons say," I observed.</p>

<p>He did not heed me. "To win everything that mankind has ever
striven for, and then to cast it aside. To be Emperor of the
Earth and then to slip out of the ken of mankind and take up the
sandals and begging-bowl. The man who can do that has conquered
the world--he is not a king but a god. Only he must be a king
first to achieve it."</p>

<p>I cannot hope to reproduce the atmosphere of that scene, the
bare top of the hill in the blue summer weather, and that man,
nearing, as he thought, the summit of success, and suddenly
questioning all mortal codes of value. In all my dealings with
Medina I was obsessed by the sense of my inferiority to him, that
I was like a cab horse compared to an Arab stallion, and now I
felt it like a blow in the face. That was the kind of thing
Napoleon might have said--and done--had his schemes not gone
astray. I knew I was contending with a devil, but I know also
that it was a great devil.</p>

<p>We returned to town just in time to dress for dinner, and all
my nervousness revived a hundredfold. This was the night of
crisis, and I loathed having to screw myself up to emergencies
late in the day. Such things should take place in the early
morning. It was like going over the top in France; I didn't mind
it so much when it happened during a drizzling dawn, when one was
anyhow depressed and only half-awake, but I abominated an attack
in the cold-blooded daylight, or in the dusk when one wanted to
relax.</p>

<p>That evening I shaved, I remember, very carefully, as if I
were decking myself out for a sacrifice. I wondered what would be
my feelings when I next shaved. I wondered what Mary and Sandy
were doing. . . .</p>

<p>What Mary and Sandy were doing at that precise moment I do not
know, but I can now unfold certain contemporary happenings which
were then hid from me. . . . Mercot and Gaudian were having a
late tea in the Midland express, having nearly broken their necks
in a furious motor race to catch the train at Hawick. The former
was clean and shaven, his hair nicely cut, and his clothes a
fairly well-fitting ready-made suit of flannels. He was deeply
sunburnt, immensely excited, and constantly breaking in on
Gaudian's study of the works of Sir Walter Scott.</p>

<p>"Newhover is to be let loose to-day. What do you suppose he'll
do?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Nothing--yet awhile," was the answer. "I said certain things
to him. He cannot openly go back to Germany, and I do not think
he dare come to England. He fears the vengeance of his employer.
He will disappear for a little, and then emerge in some new crime
with a new name and a changed face. He is the eternal
scoundrel."</p>

<p>The young man's face lighted up pleasantly. "If I live to be a
hundred," he said, "I can't enjoy anything half as much as that
clip I gave him on the jaw."</p>

<p align="CENTER">*****</p>

<p>In a room in a country house on the Middlesex and Bucks
borders Turpin was talking to a girl. He was in evening dress, a
very point-device young man, and she was wearing a wonderful
gown, grass-green in colour and fantastically cut. Her face was
heavily made up, and her scarlet lips and stained eyebrows stood
out weirdly against the dead white of her skin. But it was a
different face from that which I first saw in the dancing-hall.
Life had come back to it, the eyes were no longer dull like
pebbles, but were again the windows of a soul. There was still
fear in those eyes and bewilderment, but they were human again,
and shone at this moment with a wild affection.</p>

<p>"I am terrified," she said. "I have to go to that awful place
with that awful man. Please, Antoine, please, do not leave me.
You have brought me out of a grave, and you cannot let me slip
back again."</p>

<p>He held her close to him and stroked her hair.</p>

<p>"I think it is--how do you say it?--the last lap. My very dear
one, we cannot fail our friends. I follow you soon. The grey
man--I do not know his name--he told me so, and he is a friend. A
car is ordered for me half an hour after you drive off with that
Odell."</p>

<p>"But what does it all mean?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I do not know, but I think--I am sure--it is the work of our
friends. Consider, my little one. I am brought to the house where
you are, but those who have charge of you do not know I am here.
When Odell comes I am warned and locked in my room. I am not
allowed out of it. I have had no exercise except sparring with
that solemn English valet. He indeed has been most amiable, and
has allowed me to keep myself in form. He boxes well, too, but I
have studied under our own Jules and he is no match for me. But
when the coast is clear I am permitted to see you, and I have
waked you from sleep, my princess. Therefore so far it is good.
As to what will happen to-night I do not know, but I fancy it is
the end of our troubles. The grey man has told me as much. If you
go back to that dance place, I think I follow you, and then we
shall see something. Have no fear, little one. You go back as a
prisoner no more, but as an actress to play a part, and I know
you will play the part well. You will not permit the man Odell to
suspect. Presently I come, and I think there will be an
<i>&eacute;claircissement</i>--also, please God, a
reckoning."</p>

<p>The wooden-faced valet entered and signed to the young man,
who kissed the girl and followed him. A few minutes later Turpin
was in his own room, with the door locked behind him. Then came a
sound of the wheels of a car outside, and he listened with a
smile on his face. As he stood before the glass putting the
finishing touches to his smooth hair he was still smiling--an
ominous smile.</p>

<p align="CENTER">*****</p>

<p>Other things, which I did not know about, were happening that
evening. From a certain modest office near Tower Hill a gentleman
emerged to seek his rooms in Mayfair. His car was waiting for him
at the street corner, but to his surprise as he got into it
someone entered also from the other side, and the address to
which the car ultimately drove was not Clarges Street. The
office, too, which he had left locked and bolted was presently
open, and men were busy there till far into the night--men who
did not belong to his staff. An eminent publicist, who was the
special patron of the distressed populations of Central Europe,
was starting out to dine at his club, when he was unaccountably
delayed, and had to postpone his dinner. The Spanish copper
company in London Wall had been doing little business of late,
except to give luncheons to numerous gentlemen, but that night
its rooms were lit, and people who did not look like city clerks
were investigating its documents. In Paris a certain French count
of royalist proclivities, who had a box that night for the opera
and was giving a little dinner beforehand, did not keep his
appointment, to the discomfiture of his guests, and a telephone
message to his rooms near the Champs Elys&eacute;es elicited no
reply. There was a gruff fellow at the other end who discouraged
conversation. A worthy Glasgow accountant, an elder of the kirk
and a prospective candidate for Parliament, did not return that
evening to his family, and the police, when appealed to, gave
curious answers. The office, just off Fleet Street, of the
<i>Christian Advocate</i> of Milwaukee, a paper which cannot have
had much of a circulation in England, was filled about six
o'clock with silent preoccupied people, and the manager,
surprised and rather wild of eye, was taken off in a taxi by two
large gentlemen who had not had previously the honour of his
acquaintance. Odd things seemed to be happening up and down the
whole world. More than one ship did not sail at the appointed
hour because of the interest of certain people in the passenger
lists; a meeting of decorous bankers in Genoa was unexpectedly
interrupted by the police; offices of the utmost respectability
were occupied and examined by the blundering minions of the law;
several fashionable actresses did not appear to gladden their
admirers, and more than one pretty dancer was absent from the
scene of her usual triumphs; a Senator in Western America, a high
official in Rome, and four deputies in France found their
movements restricted, and a Prince of the Church, after receiving
a telephone message, fell to his prayers. A mining magnate in
Westphalia, visiting Antwerp on business, found that he was not
permitted to catch the train he had settled on. Five men, all
highly placed, and one woman, for no cause apparent to their
relatives, chose to rid themselves of life between the hours of
six and seven. There was an unpleasant occurrence in a town on
the Loire, where an Englishman, motoring to the south of
France--a typical English squire, well known in hunting circles
in Shropshire--was visited at his hotel by two ordinary
Frenchmen, whose conversation seemed unpalatable to him. He was
passing something from his waistcoat pocket to his mouth, when
they had the audacity to lay violent hands on him, and to slip
something over his wrists.</p>

<p align="CENTER">*****</p>

<p>It was a heavenly clear evening when Medina and I set out to
walk the half-mile to Mervyn Street. I had been so cloistered and
harassed during the past weeks that I had missed the coming of
summer. Suddenly the world seemed to have lighted up, and the
streets were filled with that intricate odour of flowers, scent,
hot wood pavements and asphalt which is the summer smell of
London. Cars were waiting at house-doors, and women in pretty
clothes getting into them; men were walking dinner-wards, with
some of whom we exchanged greetings; the whole earth seemed full
of laughter and happy movement. And it was shut off from me. I
seemed to be living on the other side of a veil from this
cheerful world, and I could see nothing but a lonely old man with
a tragic face waiting for a lost boy. There was one moment at the
corner of Berkeley Square when I accidentally jostled Medina, and
had to clench my hands and bite my lips to keep myself from
throttling him there and then.</p>

<p>The dining-room in Mervyn Street looked west, and the evening
light strove with the candles on the table, and made a fairy-like
scene of the flowers and silver. It was a full meeting--fifteen,
I think--and the divine weather seemed to have put everybody in
the best of spirits. I had almost forgotten Medina's repute with
the ordinary man, and was staggered anew at the signs of his
popularity. He was in the chair that evening, and a better
chairman of such a dinner I have never seen. He had the right
word for everybody, and we sat down to table like a party of
undergraduates celebrating a successful cricket-match.</p>

<p>I was on the chairman's right hand, next to Burminster, with
Palliser-Yeates opposite me. At first the talk was chiefly about
the Derby and Ascot entries, about which Medina proved uncommonly
well posted. He had a lot of inside knowledge from the Chilton
stables, and showed himself a keen critic of form; also he was a
perfect pundit about the pedigree of race-horses, and made
Burminster, who fancied himself in the same line, gape with
admiration. I suppose a brain like his could get up any subject
at lightning speed, and he thought this kind of knowledge useful
to him, for I don't believe he cared more for a horse than for a
cat.</p>

<p>Once, during the Somme battle, I went to dine at a French
ch&acirc;teau behind the lines, as the guest of the only son of
the house. It was an ancient place, with fishponds and terraces,
and there were only two people in it, an old Comtesse and a girl
of fifteen called Simone. At dinner, I remember, a decrepit
butler filled for me five glasses of different clarets, till I
found the one I preferred. Afterwards I walked in the garden with
Simone in a wonderful yellow twilight, watching the fat carp in
the ponds, and hearing the grumbling of the distant guns. I felt
in that hour the poignant contrast of youth and innocence and
peace with that hideous world of battle a dozen miles off.
To-night I had the same feeling--the jolly party of clean, hard,
decent fellows, and the abominable hinterland of mystery and
crime of which the man at the head of the table was the master. I
must have been poor company, but happily everybody was talkative,
and I did my best to grin at Burminster's fooling.</p>

<p>Presently the talk drifted away from sport. Palliser-Yeates
was speaking, and his fresh boyish colour contrasted oddly with
his wise eyes and grave voice.</p>

<p>"I can't make out what is happening," he said in reply to a
remark of Leithen's. "The City has suddenly become jumpy, and
there's no reason in the facts that I can see for it. There's
been a good deal of realisation of stocks, chiefly by foreign
holders, but there are a dozen explanations of that. No, there's
a kind of <i>malaise</i> about, and it's unpleasantly like what I
remember in June 1914. I was in Whittingtons' then, and we
suddenly found the foundations beginning to crumble--oh yes,
before the Serajevo murders. You remember Charlie Esmond's
smash--well, that was largely due to the spasm of insecurity that
shook the world. People now and then get a feeling in their bones
that something bad is going to happen. And probably they are
right, and it has begun to happen."</p>

<p>"Good Lord!" said Leithen. "I don't like this. Is it another
war?"</p>

<p>Palliser-Yeates did not answer at once. "It looks like it. I
admit it's almost unthinkable, but then all wars are really
unthinkable, till you're in the middle of them."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" Medina cried. "There's no nation on the globe fit
to go to war, except half-civilised races with whom it is the
normal condition. You forget how much we know since 1914. You
couldn't get even France to fight without provoking a
revolution--a middle-class revolution, the kind that
succeeds."</p>

<p>Burminster looked relieved. "The next war," he said, "will be
a dashed unpleasant affair. So far as I can see there will be
very few soldiers killed, but an enormous number of civilians.
The safest place will be the front. There will be such a rush to
get into the army that we'll have to have conscription to make
people remain in civil life. The <i>embusqu&eacute;s</i> will be
the regulars."</p>

<p>As he spoke someone entered the room, and to my amazement I
saw that it was Sandy.</p>

<p>He was looking extraordinarily fit and as brown as a berry. He
murmured an apology to the chairman for being late, patted the
bald patch on Burminster's head, and took a seat at the other end
of the table. "I'll cut in where you've got to," he told the
waiters. "No--don't bother about fish. I want some English roast
beef and a tankard of beer."</p>

<p>There was a chorus of questions.</p>

<p>"Just arrived an hour ago. I've been in the East--Egypt and
Palestine. Flew most of the way back."</p>

<p>He nodded to me, and smiled at Medina and raised his tankard
to him.</p>

<p>I was not in a good position for watching Medina's face, but
so far as I could see it was unchanged. He hated Sandy, but he
didn't fear him now, when his plans had practically come to
fruition. Indeed he was very gracious to him, and asked in his
most genial tones what he had been after.</p>

<p>"Civil aviation," said Sandy. "I'm going to collar the pilgrim
traffic to the Holy Places. You've been in Mecca?" he asked Pugh,
who nodded. "You remember the <i>hamelidari</i> crowd who used to
organise the transport from Mespot. Well, I'm a <i>hamelidari</i>
on a big scale. I am prepared to bring the rank of <i>hadji</i>
within reach of the poorest and feeblest. I'm going to be the
great benefactor of the democracy of Islam, by means of a fleet
of patched-up 'planes and a few kindred spirits that know the
East. I'll let you fellows in on the ground-floor when I float my
company. John"--he addressed Palliser-Yeates--"I look to you to
manage the flotation."</p>

<p>Sandy was obviously ragging, and no one took him seriously. He
sat there with his merry brown face, looking absurdly young and
girlish, so that the most suspicious could have seen nothing more
in him than the ordinary mad Englishman who lived for adventure
and novelty. Me he never addressed, and I was glad of it, for I
was utterly at sea. What did he mean by turning up now? What part
was he to play in the events of the night? I could not have
controlled the anxiety in my voice if I had been forced to speak
to him.</p>

<p>A servant brought Medina a note, which he opened at leisure
and read. "No answer," he said, and stuffed it into his pocket. I
had a momentary dread that he might have got news of
Macgillivray's round-up, but his manner reassured me.</p>

<p>There were people there who wanted to turn Sandy to other
subjects, especially Fulleylove and the young Cambridge don,
Nightingale. They wanted to know about South Arabia, of which at
the time the world was talking. Some fellow, I forget his name,
was trying to raise an expedition to explore it.</p>

<p>"It's the last geographical secret left unriddled," he said,
and now he spoke seriously. "Well, perhaps not quite the last.
I'm told there's still something to be done with the southern
tributaries of the Amazon. Mornington, you know, believes there's
a chance of finding some of the Inca people still dwelling in the
unexplored upper glens. But all the rest have gone. Since the
beginning of the century we've made a clean sweep of the jolly
old mysteries that made the world worth living in. We have been
to both the Poles, and to Lhasa, and to the Mountains of the
Moon. We haven't got to the top of Everest yet, but we know what
it is like. Mecca and Medina are as stale as Bournemouth. We know
that there's nothing very stupendous in the Brahmaputra gorges.
There's little left for a man's imagination to play with, and our
children will grow up in a dull, shrunken world. Except, of
course, the Great Southern Desert of Arabia."</p>

<p>"Do you think it can be crossed?" Nightingale asked.</p>

<p>"It's hard to say, and the man who tried it would take
almighty risks. I don't fancy myself pinning my life to milk
camels. They're chancy brutes."</p>

<p>"I don't believe there's anything there," said Fulleylove,
"except eight hundred miles of soft sand."</p>

<p>"I'm not so sure. I've heard strange stories. There was a man
I met once in Oman, who went west from the Manah oasis . . ."</p>

<p>He stopped to taste the club madeira, then set down the glass
and looked at his watch.</p>

<p>"Great Scott!" he said. "I must be off. I'm sorry, Mr.
President, but I felt I must see you all again. You don't mind my
butting in?"</p>

<p>He was half-way to the door, when Burminster asked where he
was going.</p>

<p>"To seek the straw in some sequestered grange. . . . Meaning
the ten-thirty from King's Cross. I'm off to Scotland to see my
father. Remember, I'm the last prop of an ancient house.
Good-bye, all of you. I'll tell you about my schemes at the next
dinner."</p>

<p>As the door closed on him I had a sense of the blackest
depression and loneliness. He was my one great ally, and he came
and disappeared like a ship in the night, without a word to me. I
felt like a blind bat, and I must have showed my feeling in my
face, for Medina saw it and put it down, I dare say, to my
dislike of Sandy. He asked Palliser-Yeates to take his place.
"It's not the Scotch express, like Arbuthnot, but I'm off for a
holiday very soon, and I have an appointment I must keep." That
was all to the good, for I had been wondering how I was to make
an excuse for my visit to the Fields of Eden. He asked me when I
would be back and I said listlessly within the next hour. He
nodded. "I'll be home by then, and can let you in if Odell has
gone to bed." Then with a little chaff of Burminster he left, so
much at ease that I was positive he had had no bad news. I waited
for five minutes and followed suit. The time was a quarter past
ten.</p>

<p align="CENTER">*****</p>

<p>At the entrance to the Club in Wellesley Street I expected to
have some difficulty, but the man in the box at the head of the
stairs, after a sharp glance at me, let me pass. He was not the
fellow who had been there on my visit with Archie Roylance and
yet I had a queer sense of having seen his face before. I stepped
into the dancing-room with its heavy flavour of scent and its
infernal din of mountebank music, sat down at a side table and
ordered a liqueur.</p>

<p>There was a difference in the place, but at first I could not
put my finger on it. Everything seemed the same; the only face I
knew was Miss Victor's, and that had the same mask-like pallor;
she was dancing with a boy, who seemed to be trying to talk to
her and getting few replies. Odell I did not see, nor the Jew
with the beard. I observed with interest the little casement
above from which I had looked when I burgled the curiosity shop.
There were fewer people to-night, but apparently the same
class.</p>

<p>No, not quite the same class. The women were the same, but the
men were different. They were older and more--how shall I put
it?--responsible-looking, and had not the air of the professional
dancing partner or the young man on the spree. They were heavier
footed, too, though good enough performers. Somehow I got the
notion that most of them were not habitu&eacute;s of this kind of
place and were here with a purpose.</p>

<p>As soon as this idea dawned on me I began to notice other
things. There were fewer foreign waiters, and their number was
steadily decreasing. Drinks would be ordered and would be long in
coming; a servant, once he left the hall, seemed to be
unaccountably detained. And then I observed another thing. There
was a face looking down from the casement above; I could see it
like a shadow behind the dirty glass.</p>

<p>Presently Odell appeared, a resplendent figure in evening
dress, with a diamond solitaire in his shirt and a red silk
handkerchief in his left sleeve. He looked massive and
formidable, but puffier than ever, and his small pig's eyes were
very bright. I fancied he had been having a glass or two, just
enough to excite him. He swaggered about among the small tables,
turning now and then to stare at the girl in green, and then went
out again. I looked at my watch, and saw that it was a quarter to
eleven.</p>

<p>When I lifted my head Mary had arrived. No more paint and
powder and bizarre clothes. She was wearing the pale blue gown
she had worn at our Hunt Ball in March, and her hair was dressed
in the simple way I loved, which showed all the lights and
shadows in the gold. She came in like a young queen, cast a swift
glance round the room, and then, shading her eyes with her hand,
looking up towards the casement. It must have been a signal, for
I saw a hand wave.</p>

<p>As she stood there, very still and poised like a runner, the
music stopped suddenly. The few men who were still dancing spoke
to their partners and moved towards the door. I observed the
bearded Jew hurry in and look round. A man touched him on the arm
and drew him away, and that was the last I saw of him.</p>

<p>Suddenly Odell reappeared. He must have had some warning which
required instant action. I shall never know what it was, but it
may have announced the round-up, and the course to be followed
towards the hostages. He signed peremptorily to Miss Victor and
went forward as if to take her arm. "You gotta come along," I
heard, when my eyes were occupied with a new figure.</p>

<p>Turpin was there, a pale taut young man with his brows knit,
as I remembered them in tight corners in France. The green girl
had darted to Mary's side, and Turpin strode up to her.</p>

<p>"Adela, my dear," he said, "I think it is time for you to be
going home."</p>

<p>The next I saw was Miss Victor's hand clutching his arm and
Odell advancing with a flush on his sallow face.</p>

<p>"You letta go that goil," he was saying. "You got no business
with her. She's my goil."</p>

<p>Turpin was smiling. "I think not, my friend." He disengaged
Adela's arm and put her behind him, and with a swift step struck
Odell a resounding smack on the cheek with the flat of his
hand.</p>

<p>The man seemed to swell with fury. "Hell!" he cried, with a
torrent of Bowery oaths. "My smart guy, I've got something in my
mitt for you. You for the sleep pill."</p>

<p>I would have given a fortune to be in Turpin's place, for I
felt that a scrap was what I needed to knit up my ragged nerves.
But I couldn't chip in, for this was clearly his special quarrel,
and very soon I saw that he was not likely to need my help.</p>

<p>Smiling wickedly, he moved round the pug, who had his fists
up. <i>"Fiche-moi la paix,"</i> he crooned. "My friend, I am
going to massacre you."</p>

<p>I stepped towards Mary, for I wanted to get the women outside,
but she was busy attending to Miss Victor, whom the strain of the
evening had left on the verge of swooning. So I only saw bits of
the fight. Turpin kept Odell at long range, for in-fighting would
have been fatal, and he tired him with his lightning movements,
till the professional's bad training told and his wind went. When
the Frenchman saw his opponent puffing and his cheeks mottling he
started to sail in. That part I witnessed, and I hope that Mary
and Miss Victor did not understand old Turpin's language, for he
spoke gently to himself the whole time, and it was the
quintessence of all the esoteric abuse that the French
<i>poilu</i> accumulated during the four years of war. His
tremendous reach gave him an advantage, he was as light on his
legs as a fencer, and his arms seemed to shoot out with the force
of a steam-hammer. I realised what I had never known before, that
his slimness was deceptive, and that stripped he would be a fine
figure of sinew and bone. Also I understood that a big fellow,
however formidable, if he is untrained and a little drunk, will
go down before speed and quick wits and the deftness of
youth.</p>

<p>They fought for just over six minutes. Turpin's deadliest
blows were on Odell's body, but the knockout came with one on the
point of the chin. The big man crumpled up in a heap, and the
back of his head banged on the floor. Turpin wrapped a wisp of a
handkerchief round his knuckles, which had suffered from Odell's
solitaire, and looked about him.</p>

<p>"What is to become of this offal?" he asked.</p>

<p>One of the dancers replied. "We will look after him, sir. The
whole house is in our hands. This man is wanted on a good many
grounds."</p>

<p>I walked up to the prostrate Odell, and took the latch-key
from his waistcoat pocket. Turpin and Adela had gone, and Mary
stood watching me. I observed that she was very pale.</p>

<p>"I am going to Hill Street," I said.</p>

<p>"I will come later," was her answer. "I hope in less than an
hour. The key will let you in. There will be people there to keep
the door open for me."</p>

<p>Her face had the alert and absorbed look that old Peter
Pienaar's used to have when he was after big game. There was no
other word spoken between us. She entered a big saloon-car which
was waiting in the street below, and I walked to Royston Square
to find a taxi. It was not yet eleven o'clock.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h1><a name="c19">CHAPTER XIX</a></h1>

<h1>THE NIGHT OF THE FIRST OF JUNE--LATER</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>A little after eleven that night a late walker in Palmyra
Square would have seen a phenomenon rare in the dingy
neighbourhood. A large motor-car drew up at the gate of No. 7,
where dwelt the teacher of music who had long retired to rest. A
woman descended, wearing a dark cloak and carrying a parcel, and
stood for a second looking across the road to where the lean elms
in the centre of the square made a patch of shade. She seemed to
find there what she expected, for she hastened to the gate of No.
4. She did not approach the front door, but ran down the path to
the back where the tradesmen called, and as soon as she was out
of sight several figures emerged from the shadow and moved
towards the gate.</p>

<p>Miss Outhwaite opened to her tap. "My, but you're late, miss,"
she whispered, as the woman brushed past her into the dim
kitchen. Then she gasped, for some transformation had taken place
in the district-visitor. It was no longer a faded spinster that
she saw, but a dazzling lady, gorgeously dressed as it seemed to
her, and of a remarkable beauty.</p>

<p>"I've brought your hat, Elsie," she said. "It's rather a nice
one, and I think you'll like it. Now go at once and open the
front door."</p>

<p>"But Madame . . ." the girl gasped.</p>

<p>"Never mind Madame. You are done with Madame. To-morrow you
will come and see me at this address," and she gave her a slip of
paper. "I will see that you do not suffer. Now hurry, my
dear."</p>

<p>The girl seemed to be mesmerised, and turned to obey. The
district-visitor followed her, but did not wait in the hall.
Instead, she ran lightly up the stairs, guiding herself by a
small electric torch, and when the front door was open and four
silent figures had entered she was nowhere to be seen.</p>

<p>For the next quarter of an hour an inquisitive passer-by would
have noted lights spring out and then die away in more than one
room of No. 4. He might have also heard the sound of low excited
speech. At the end of that space of time he would have seen the
district-visitor descend the steps and enter the big car which
had moved up to the gate. She was carrying something in her
arms.</p>

<p>Within, in a back room, a furious woman was struggling with a
telephone, from which she got no answer, since the line had been
cut. And an old woman sat in a chair by the hearth, raving and
muttering, with a face like death.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>When I got to Hill Street, I waited till the taxi had driven
off before I entered. There was a man standing in the porch of
the house opposite, and as I waited another passed me, who
nodded. "Good evening, Sir Richard," he said, and though I did
not recognise him I knew where he came from. My spirits were at
their lowest ebb, and not even the sight of these arrangements
could revive them. For I knew that, though we had succeeded with
Miss Victor and Mercot, we had failed with the case which
mattered most. I was going to try to scare Medina or to buy him,
and I felt that both purposes were futile, for the awe of him was
still like a black fog on my soul.</p>

<p>I let myself in with Odell's latch-key and left the heavy door
ajar. Then I switched on the staircase lights and mounted to the
library. I left the lights burning behind me, for they would be
needed by those who followed.</p>

<p>Medina was standing by the fireplace, in which logs had been
laid ready for a match. As usual, he had only the one lamp lit,
that on his writing-table. He had a slip of paper in his hand,
one of the two which had lain in the top drawer, as I saw by the
dates and the ruled lines. I fancy he had been attempting in vain
to ring up Palmyra Square. Some acute suspicion had been aroused
in him, and he had been trying to take action. His air of leisure
was the kind which is hastily assumed; a minute before I was
convinced he had been furiously busy.</p>

<p>There was surprise in his face when he saw me.</p>

<p>"Hullo!" he said, "how did you get in? I didn't hear you ring.
I told Odell to go to bed."</p>

<p>I was feeling so weak and listless that I wanted to sit down,
so I dropped into a chair out of the circle of the lamp.</p>

<p>"Yes," I said. "Odell's in bed all right. I let myself in with
his key. I've just seen that Bowery tough put to sleep with a
crack on the chin from Turpin. You know--the Marquis de la Tour
du Pin."</p>

<p>I had a good strategic position, for I could see his face
clearly and he could only see the outline of mine.</p>

<p>"What on earth are you talking about?" he said.</p>

<p>"Odell has been knocked out. You see, Turpin has taken Miss
Victor back to her father." I looked at my watch. "And by this
time Lord Mercot should be in London--unless the Scotch express
is late."</p>

<p>A great tide of disillusion must have swept over his mind, but
his face gave no sign of it. It had grown stern, but as composed
as a judge's.</p>

<p>"You're behaving as if you were mad. What has come over you? I
know nothing of Lord Mercot--you mean the Alcester boy? Or Miss
Victor."</p>

<p>"Oh yes, you do," I said wearily. I did not know where to
begin, for I wanted to get him at once to the real business.
"It's a long story. Do you want me to tell it when you know it
all already?" I believe I yawned and I felt so tired I could
hardly put the sentences together.</p>

<p>"I insist that you explain this nonsense," was his reply. One
thing he must have realised by now, that he had no power over me,
for his jaw was set and his eyes stern, as if he were regarding
not a satellite, but an enemy and an equal.</p>

<p>"Well, you and your friends for your own purposes took three
hostages, and I have made it my business to free them. I let you
believe that your tomfoolery had mastered me--your performance in
this room and Newhover and Madame Breda and the old blind lady
and all the rest of it. When you thought I was drugged and
demented I was specially wide awake. I had to abuse your
hospitality--rather a dirty game, you may say, but then I was
dealing with a scoundrel. I went to Norway when you thought I was
in bed at Fosse, and I found Mercot, and I expect at this moment
Newhover is feeling rather cheap. . . . Miss Victor, too. She
wasn't very difficult, once we hit on the Fields of Eden. You're
a very clever man, Mr. Medina, but you oughtn't to circulate
doggerel verses. Take my advice and stick to good poetry."</p>

<p>By this time the situation must have been clear to him, but
there was not a quiver in that set hard face. I take off my hat
to the best actor I have ever met--the best but one, the German
count who lies buried at the farm of Gavrelle. "You've gone off
your head," he said, and his quiet considerate voice belied his
eyes.</p>

<p>"Oh no! I rather wish I had. I hate to think that there can be
so base a thing in the world as you. A man with the brains of a
god and living only to glut his rotten vanity! You should be
scotched like a snake."</p>

<p>For a moment I had a blessed thought that he was about to go
for me, for I would have welcomed a scrap like nothing else on
earth. There may have been a flicker of passion, but it was
quickly suppressed. His eyes had become grave and
reproachful.</p>

<p>"I have been kind to you," he said, "and have treated you as a
friend. This is my reward. The most charitable explanation is
that your wits are unhinged. But you had better leave this
house."</p>

<p>"Not before you hear me out. I have something to propose, Mr.
Medina. You have still a third hostage in your hands. We are
perfectly aware of the syndicate you have been working with--the
Barcelona nut business, and the Jacobite count, and your friend
the Shropshire master-of-hounds. Scotland Yard has had its hand
over the lot for months, and to-night the hand will be closed.
That shop is shut for good. Now listen to me, for I have a
proposal to make. You have the ambition of the devil, and have
already made for yourself a great name. I will do nothing to
smirch that name. I will swear a solemn oath to hold my tongue. I
will go away from England, if you like. I will bury the memory of
the past months, and my knowledge will never be used to put a
spoke in your wheel. Also, since your syndicate is burst up, you
will want money. Well, I will give you one hundred thousand
pounds. And in return for my silence and my cash I ask you to
restore to me David Warcliff, safe and sane. Sane, I say, for
whatever you have made of the poor little chap you have got to
unmake it."</p>

<p>I had made up my mind about this offer as I came along in the
taxi. It was a big sum, but I had more money than I needed, and
Blenkiron, who had millions, would lend a hand.</p>

<p>His face showed no response, no interest, only the same stern
melancholy regard.</p>

<p>"Poor devil!" he said. "You're madder than I thought."</p>

<p>My lassitude was disappearing, and I began to get angry.</p>

<p>"If you do not agree," I said, "I will blacken your reputation
throughout the civilised world. What use will England have for a
kidnapper and a blackmailer and--a--a bogus magician?"</p>

<p>But as I spoke I knew that my threats were foolish. He smiled,
a wise, pitying smile, which made me shiver with wrath.</p>

<p>"No, it is you who will appear as the blackmailer," he said
softly. "Consider. You are making the most outrageous charges. I
don't quite follow your meaning, but clearly they are
outrageous--and what evidence have you to support them? Your own
dreams. Who will believe you? I have had the good fortune to make
many friends, and they are loyal friends." There was a gentle
regret in his voice. "Your story will be laughed to scorn. Of
course people will be sorry for you, for you are popular in a
way. They will say that a meritorious soldier, more notable
perhaps for courage than for brains, has gone crazy, and they
will comment on the long-drawn-out effects of the War. I must of
course protect myself. If you blackguard me I will prosecute you
for slander and get your mental condition examined."</p>

<p>It was only too true. I had no evidence except my own word. I
knew that it would be impossible to link up Medina with the
doings of the syndicate--he was too clever for that. His blind
mother would die on the rack before she spoke, and his tools
could not give him away, because they were tools and knew
nothing. The world would laugh at me if I opened my mouth. At
that moment I think I had my first full realisation of Medina's
quality. Here was a man who had just learned that his pet schemes
were shattered, who had had his vanity wounded to the quick by
the revelation of how I had fooled him, and yet he could play
what was left of the game with coolness and precision. I had
struck the largest size of opponent.</p>

<p>"What about the hundred thousand pounds, then?" I asked. "That
is my offer for David Warcliff."</p>

<p>"You are very good," he said mockingly. "I might feel
insulted, if I did not know you were a lunatic."</p>

<p>I sat there staring at the figure in the glow of the one lamp,
which seemed to wax more formidable as I looked, and a
thousandfold more sinister. I saw the hideous roundness of his
head, the mercilessness of his eyes, so that I wondered how I had
ever thought him handsome. But now that most of his game was
spoiled he only seemed the greater, the more assured. Were there
no gaps in his defences? He had kinks in him--witness the silly
rhyme which had given me the first clue. . . . Was there no
weakness in that panoply which I could use? Physical
fear--physical pain--could anything be done with that?</p>

<p>I got to my feet with a blind notion of closing with him. He
divined my intention, for he showed something in his hand which
gleamed dully. "Take care," he said. "I can defend myself against
any maniac."</p>

<p>"Put it away," I said hopelessly. "You're safe enough from me.
My God, I hope that somewhere there is a hell." I felt as feeble
as a babe, and all the while the thought of the little boy was
driving me mad.</p>

<p align="CENTER">*****</p>

<p>Suddenly I saw Medina's eyes look over my shoulder. Someone
had come into the room, and I turned and found
Khar&aacute;ma.</p>

<p>He was in evening dress, wearing a turban, and in the dusk his
dark malign face seemed an embodied sneer at my helplessness. I
did not see how Medina took his arrival, for all at once
something seemed to give in my head. For the Indian I felt now
none of the awe which I had for the other, only a flaming,
overpowering hate. That this foul thing out of the East should
pursue his devilries unchecked seemed to me beyond bearing. I
forgot Medina's pistol and everything else, and went for him like
a wild beast.</p>

<p>He dodged me, and, before I knew, had pulled off his turban,
and tossed it in my face.</p>

<p>"Don't be an old ass, Dick," he said.</p>

<p>Panting with fury, I stopped short and stared. The voice was
Sandy's, and so was the figure. . . . And the face, too, when I
came to look into it. He had done something with the corners of
his eyebrows and tinted the lids with kohl, but the eyes, which I
had never before seen properly opened, were those of my
friend.</p>

<p>"What an artist the world has lost in me!" he laughed, and
tried to tidy his disordered hair.</p>

<p>Then he nodded to Medina. "We meet again sooner than we
expected. I missed my train, and came to look for Dick. . . . Lay
down that pistol, please. I happen to be armed too, you see. It's
no case for shooting anyhow. Do you mind if I smoke?"</p>

<p>He flung himself into an arm-chair and lit a cigarette. Once
more I was conscious of my surroundings, for hitherto for all I
knew I might have been arguing in a desert. My eyes had cleared
and my brain was beginning to work again. I saw the great room
with its tiers of books, some glimmering, some dusky; Sandy
taking his ease in his chair and gazing placidly up into Medina's
face; Medina with his jaw set but his eyes troubled--yes, for the
first time I saw flickers of perplexity in those eyes.</p>

<p>"Dick, I suppose, has been reasoning with you," Sandy said
mildly. "And you have told him that he was a madman? Quite right.
He is. You have pointed out to him that his story rests on his
unsupported evidence, which no one will believe, for I admit it
is an incredible tale. You have warned him that if he opens his
mouth you will have him shut up as a lunatic. Is that correct,
Dick?</p>

<p>"Well," he continued, looking blandly at Medina, "that was a
natural view for you to take. Only, of course, you made one small
error. His evidence will not be unsupported."</p>

<p>Medina laughed, but there was no ease in his laugh. "Who are
the other lunatics?"</p>

<p>"Myself for one. You have interested me for quite a long time,
Mr. Medina. I will confess that one of my reasons for coming home
in March was to have the privilege of your acquaintance. I have
taken a good deal of pains about it. I have followed your own
line of studies--indeed, if the present situation weren't so
hectic, I should like to exchange notes with you as a
fellow-inquirer. I have traced your career in Central Asia and
elsewhere with some precision. I think I know more about you than
anybody else in the world."</p>

<p>Medina made no answer. The tables were turning, and his eyes
were chained to the slight figure in the arm-chair.</p>

<p>"All that is very interesting," Sandy went on, "but it is not
quite germane to the subject before us. Khar&aacute;ma, whom we
both remember in his pride, unfortunately died last year. It was
kept very secret for obvious reasons--the goodwill of his
business was very valuable and depended upon his being alive--and
I only heard of it by a lucky accident. So I took the liberty of
borrowing his name, Mr. Medina. As Khar&aacute;ma I was honoured
with your confidence. Rather a cad's trick, you will say, and I
agree, but in an affair like this one has no choice of weapons. .
. . You did more than confide in me. You trusted me with Miss
Victor and the Marquis de la Tour du Pin, when it was important
that they should be in safe keeping. . . . I have a good deal of
evidence to support Dick."</p>

<p>"Moonshine!" said Medina. "Two lunacies do not make sense. I
deny every detail of your rubbish."</p>

<p>"Out of the mouth of two or three witnesses," said Sandy
pleasantly. "There is still a third . . . Lavater," he cried,
"come in, we're ready for you."</p>

<p>There entered the grey melancholy man, whom I had seen on my
first visit here, and in the house behind Little Fardell Street.
I noticed that he walked straight to Sandy's chair, and did not
look at Medina.</p>

<p>"Lavater you know already, I think. He used to be a friend of
mine, and lately we have resumed the friendship. He was your
disciple for some time, but has now relinquished that honour.
Lavater will be able to tell the world a good deal about
you."</p>

<p>Medina's face had become like a mask, and the colour had gone
out of it. He may have been a volcano within, but outside he was
cold ice. His voice, acid and sneering, came out like drops of
chilly water.</p>

<p>"Three lunatics," he said. "I deny every word you say. No one
will believe you. It is a conspiracy of madmen."</p>

<p>"Let's talk business anyhow," said Sandy. "The case against
you is proven to the hilt, but let us see how the world will
regard it. The strong point on your side is that people don't
like to confess they have been fools. You have been a very
popular man, Mr. Medina, and your many friends will be loath to
believe that you are a scoundrel. You've the hedge of your
reputation to protect you. Again, our story is so monstrous that
the ordinary Englishman may call it unbelievable, for we are not
an imaginative nation. Again we can get no help from the
principal sufferers. Miss Victor and Lord Mercot can tell an ugly
story of kidnapping, which may get a life-sentence for Odell, and
for Newhover if he is caught, but which does not implicate you.
That will be a stumbling-block to most juries, who are not as
familiar with occult science as you and I. . . . These are your
strong points. But consider what we can bring on the other side.
You are a propagandist of genius, as I once told Dick, and I can
explain just how you have fooled the world--your exploits with
Denikin and such-like. Then the three of us can tell a damning
story, and tell it from close quarters. It may sound wild, but
Dick has some reputation for good sense, and a good many people
think that I am not altogether a fool. Finally we have on our
side Scotland Yard, which is now gathering in your associates,
and we have behind us Julius Victor, who is not without
influence. . . . I do not say we can send you to prison, though I
think it likely, but we can throw such suspicion on you that for
the rest of your days you will be a marked man. You will
recognise that for you that means utter failure, for to succeed
you must swim in the glory of popular confidence."</p>

<p>I could see that Medina was shaken at last. "You may damage me
with your lies," he said slowly, "but I will be even with you.
You will find me hard to beat."</p>

<p>"I don't doubt it," was Sandy's answer. "I and my friends do
not want victory, we want success. We want David Warcliff."</p>

<p>There was no answer, and Sandy went on.</p>

<p>"We make you a proposal. The three of us will keep what we
know to ourselves. We will pledge ourselves never to breathe a
word of it--if you like we will sign a document to say that we
acknowledge our mistake. So far as we are concerned you may go on
and become Prime Minister of Britain or Archbishop of Canterbury,
or anything you jolly well like. We don't exactly love you, but
we will not interfere with the adoration of others. I'll take
myself off again to the East with Lavater, and Dick will bury
himself in Oxfordshire mud. And in return we ask that you hand
over to us David Warcliff in his right mind."</p>

<p>There was no answer.</p>

<p>Then Sandy made a mistake in tactics. "I believe you are
attached to your mother," he said. "If you accept our offer she
will be safe from annoyance. Otherwise--well, she is an important
witness."</p>

<p>The man's pride was stung to the quick. His mother must have
been for him an inner sanctuary, a thing apart from and holier
than his fiercest ambitions, the very core and shrine of his
monstrous vanity. That she should be used as a bargaining counter
stirred something deep and primeval in him, something--let me say
it--higher and better than I had imagined. A new and a human fury
burned the mask off him like tissue paper.</p>

<p>"You fools!" he cried, and his voice was harsh with rage. "You
perfect fools! You will sweat blood for that insult."</p>

<p>"It's a fair offer," said Sandy, never moving a muscle. "Do I
understand that you refuse?"</p>

<p>Medina stood on the hearthrug like an animal at bay, and upon
my soul I couldn't but admire him. The flame in his face would
have scorched most people into abject fear.</p>

<p>"Go to hell, the pack of you! Out of this house! You will
never hear a word from me till you are bleating for mercy. Get
out . . ."</p>

<p align="CENTER">*****</p>

<p>His eyes must have been dimmed by his rage, for he did not see
Mary enter. She had advanced right up to Sandy's chair before
even I noticed her. She was carrying something in her arms,
something which she held close as a mother holds a child.</p>

<p>It was the queer little girl from the house in Palmyra Square.
Her hair had grown longer and fell in wisps over her brow and her
pale tear-stained cheeks. A most piteous little object she was,
with dull blind eyes which seemed to struggle with perpetual
terror. She still wore the absurd linen smock, her skinny little
legs and arms were bare, and her thin fingers clutched at Mary's
gown.</p>

<p>Then Medina saw her, and Sandy ceased to exist for him. He
stared for a second uncomprehendingly, till the passion in his
face turned to alarm. "What have you done with her?" he barked,
and flung himself forward.</p>

<p>I thought he was going to attack Mary, so I tripped him up. He
sprawled on the floor, and since he seemed to have lost all
command of himself I reckoned that I had better keep him there. I
looked towards Mary, who nodded. "Please tie him up," she said,
and passed me the turban cloth of the late Khar&aacute;ma.</p>

<p>He fought like a tiger, but Lavater and I with a little help
from Sandy managed to truss him fairly tight, supplementing the
turban with one of the curtain cords. We laid him in an
arm-chair.</p>

<p>"What have you done with her?" he kept on, screwing his head
round to look at Mary.</p>

<p>I could not understand his maniacal concern for the little
girl, till Mary answered, and I saw what he meant by "her."</p>

<p>"No one has touched your mother. She is in the house in
Palmyra Square."</p>

<p>Then Mary laid the child down very gently in the chair where
Sandy had been sitting and stood erect before Medina.</p>

<p>"I want you to bring back this little boy's mind," she
said.</p>

<p>I suppose I should have been astonished, but I wasn't--at
least not at her words, though I had not had an inkling
beforehand of the truth. All the astonishment I was capable of
was reserved for Mary. She stood there looking down on the bound
man, her face very pale, her eyes quite gentle, her lips parted
as if in expectation. And yet there was something about her so
formidable, so implacable, that the other three of us fell into
the background. Her presence dominated everything, and the very
grace of her body and the mild sadness of her eyes seemed to make
her the more terrifying. I know now how Joan of Arc must have
looked when she led her troops into battle.</p>

<p>"Do you hear me?" she repeated. "You took away his soul and
you can give it back again. That is all I ask of you."</p>

<p>He choked before he replied. "What boy? I tell you I know
nothing. You are all mad."</p>

<p>"I mean David Warcliff. The others are free now, and he must
be free to-night. Free, and in his right mind, as when you
carried him off. Surely you understand."</p>

<p>There was no answer.</p>

<p>"That is all I ask. It is such a little thing. Then we will go
away."</p>

<p>I broke in. "Our offer holds. Do as she asks, and we will
never open our mouths about to-night's work."</p>

<p>He was not listening to me, nor was she. It was a duel between
the two of them, and as she looked at him, his face seemed to
grow more dogged and stone-like. If ever he had felt hatred it
was for this woman, for it was a conflict between two opposite
poles of life, two worlds eternally at war.</p>

<p>"I tell you I know nothing of the brat . . ."</p>

<p>She stopped him with lifted hand. "Oh, do not let us waste
time, please. It is far too late for arguing. If you do what I
ask we will go away, and you will never be troubled with us
again. I promise--we all promise. If you do not, of course we
must ruin you."</p>

<p>I think it was the confidence in her tone which stung him.</p>

<p>"I refuse," he almost screamed. "I do not know what you mean .
. . I defy you. . . . You can proclaim your lies to the world. .
. . You will not crush me. I am too strong for you."</p>

<p>There was no mistaking the finality of that defiance. I
thought it put the lid on everything. We could blast the fellow's
reputation no doubt, and win victory; but we had failed, for we
were left with that poor little mindless waif. Mary's face did
not change.</p>

<p>"If you refuse, I must try another way"; her voice was as
gentle as a mother's. "I must give David Warcliff back to his
father. . . . Dick," she turned to me, "will you light the
fire."</p>

<p>I obeyed, not knowing what she meant, and in a minute the dry
faggots were roaring up the chimney, lighting up our five faces
and the mazed child in the chair.</p>

<p>"You have destroyed a soul," she said, "and you refuse to
repair the wrong. I am going to destroy your body, and nothing
will ever repair it."</p>

<p>Then I saw her meaning, and both Sandy and I cried out.
Neither of us had led the kind of life which makes a man
squeamish, but this was too much for us. But our protests died
half-born, after one glance at Mary's face. She was my own wedded
wife, but in that moment I could no more have opposed her than
could the poor bemused child. Her spirit seemed to transcend us
all and radiate an inexorable command. She stood easily and
gracefully, a figure of motherhood and pity rather than of awe.
But all the same I did not recognise her; it was a stranger that
stood there, a stern goddess that wielded the lightnings. Beyond
doubt she meant every word she said, and her quiet voice seemed
to deliver judgment as aloof and impersonal as Fate. I could see
creeping over Medina's sullenness the shadow of terror.</p>

<p>"You are a desperate man," she was saying. "But I am far more
desperate. There is nothing on earth that can stand between me
and the saving of this child. You know that, don't you? A body
for a soul--a soul for a body--which shall it be?"</p>

<p>The light was reflected from the steel fire-irons, and Medina
saw it and shivered.</p>

<p>"You may live a long time, but you will have to live in
seclusion. No woman will ever cast eyes on you except to shudder.
People will point at you and say 'There goes the man who was
maimed by a woman--because of the soul of a child.' You will
carry your story written on your face for the world to read and
laugh and revile."</p>

<p>She had got at the central nerve of his vanity, for I think
that he was ambitious less of achievement than of the personal
glory that attends it. I dared not look at her, but I could look
at him, and I saw all the passions of hell chase each other over
his face. He tried to speak, but only choked. He seemed to bend
his whole soul to look at her, and to shiver at what he saw.</p>

<p>She turned her head to glance at the clock on the
mantelpiece.</p>

<p>"You must decide before the quarter strikes," she said. "After
that there will be no place for repentance. A body for a soul--a
soul for a body."</p>

<p>Then from her black silk reticule she took a little
oddly-shaped green bottle. She held it in her hand as if it had
been a jewel, and I gulped in horror.</p>

<p>"This is the elixir of death--of death in life, Mr. Medina. It
makes comeliness a mockery. It will burn flesh and bone into
shapes of hideousness, but it does not kill. Oh no--it does not
kill. A body for a soul--a soul for a body."</p>

<p>It was that, I think, which finished him. The threefold chime
which announced the quarter had begun when out of his dry throat
came a sound like a clucking hen's. "I agree," a voice croaked,
seeming to come from without, so queer and far away it was.</p>

<p>"Thank you," she said, as if someone had opened a door for
her. "Dick, will you please make Mr. Medina more comfortable. . .
."</p>

<p>The fire was not replenished, so the quick-burning faggots
soon died down. Again the room was shadowy, except for the single
lamp that glowed behind Medina's head.</p>

<p>I cannot describe that last scene, for I do not think my sight
was clear, and I know that my head was spinning. The child sat on
Mary's lap, with its eyes held by the glow of light. "You are
Gerda . . . you are sleepy . . . now you sleep"--I did not heed
the patter, for I was trying to think of homely things which
would keep my wits anchored. I thought chiefly of Peter John.</p>

<p>Sandy was crouched on a stool by the hearth. I noticed that he
had his hands on his knees, and that from one of them protruded
something round and dark, like the point of a pistol barrel. He
was taking no chances, but the thing was folly, for we were in
the presence of far more potent weapons. Never since the world
began was there a scene of such utter humiliation. I shivered at
the indecency of it. Medina performed his sinister ritual, but on
us spectators it had no more effect than a charade. Mary
especially sat watching it with the detachment with which one
watches a kindergarten play. The man had suddenly become a
mountebank under those fearless eyes.</p>

<p>The voices droned on, the man asking questions, the child
answering in a weak unnatural voice. "You are David Warcliff . .
. you lost your way coming from school . . . you have been ill
and have forgotten. . . . You are better now . . . you remember
Haverham and the redshanks down by the river. . . . You are
sleepy . . . I think you would like to sleep again."</p>

<p>Medina spoke. "You can wake him now. Do it carefully."</p>

<p>I got up and switched on the rest of the lights. The child was
peacefully asleep in Mary's arms, and she bent and kissed him.
"Speak to him, Dick," she said.</p>

<p>"Davie," I said loudly. "Davie, it's about time for us to get
home."</p>

<p>He opened his eyes and sat up. When he found himself on Mary's
knee, he began to clamber down. He was not accustomed to a
woman's lap, and felt a little ashamed.</p>

<p>"Davie," I repeated. "Your father will be getting tired
waiting for us. Don't you think we should go home?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," he said, and put his hand in mine.</p>

<p align="CENTER">*****</p>

<p>To my dying day I shall not forget my last sight of that
library--the blazing lights which made the books, which I had
never seen before except in shadow, gleam like a silk tapestry,
the wood-fire dying on the hearth, and the man sunk in the chair.
It may sound odd after all that had happened, but my chief
feeling was pity. Yes, pity! He seemed the loneliest thing on
God's earth. You see he had never had any friends except himself,
and his ambitions had made a barrier between him and all
humanity. Now that they were gone he was stripped naked, and left
cold and shivering in the arctic wilderness of his broken
dreams.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Mary leaned back in the car.</p>

<p>"I hope I'm not going to faint," she said. "Give me the green
bottle, please."</p>

<p>"For Heaven's sake!" I cried.</p>

<p>"Silly!" she said. "It's only eau-de-cologne."</p>

<p>She laughed, and the laugh seemed to restore her a little
though she still looked deadly pale. She fumbled in her reticule,
and drew out a robust pair of scissors.</p>

<p>"I'm going to cut Davie's hair. I can't change his clothes,
but at any rate I can make his head like a boy's again, so that
his father won't be shocked."</p>

<p>"Does he know we are coming?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I telephoned to him after dinner, but of course I said
nothing about Davie."</p>

<p>She clipped assiduously, and by the time we came to the
Pimlico square where Sir Arthur Warcliff lived she had got rid of
the long locks, and the head was now that of a pallid and thin
but wonderfully composed little boy. "Am I going back to Dad?" he
had asked, and seemed content.</p>

<p>I refused to go in--I was not fit for any more shocks--so I
sat in the car while Mary and David entered the little house. In
about three minutes Mary returned. She was crying, and yet
smiling too.</p>

<p>"I made Davie wait in the hall, and went into Sir Arthur's
study alone. He looked ill--and oh, so old and worn. I said: 'I
have brought Davie. Never mind his clothes. He's all right!' Then
I fetched him in. Oh, Dick, it was a miracle. That old darling
seemed to come back to life. . . . The two didn't run into each
other's arms . . . they shook hands . . . and the little boy
bowed his head and Sir Arthur kissed the top of it, and said
'Dear Mouse-head, you've come back to me.' . . . And then I
slipped away."</p>

<p align="CENTER">*****</p>

<p>There was another scene that night in which I played a part,
for we finished at Carlton House Terrace. Of what happened there
I have only a confused recollection. I remember Julius Victor
kissing Mary's hand, and the Duke shaking mine as if he would
never stop. I remember Mercot, who looked uncommonly fit and
handsome, toasting me in champagne, and Adela Victor sitting at a
piano and singing to us divinely. But my chief memory is of a
French nobleman whirling a distinguished German engineer into an
extemporised dance of joy.</p>

<h1><a name="c20">CHAPTER XX</a></h1>

<h1>MACHRAY</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>A week later, after much consultation with Sandy, I wrote
Medina a letter. The papers said he had gone abroad for a short
rest, and I could imagine the kind of mental purgatory he was
enduring in some Mediterranean bay. We had made up our mind to be
content with success. Victory meant a long campaign in the courts
and the Press, in which no doubt we should have won, but for
which I at any rate had no stomach. The whole business was a
nightmare which I longed to shut the door on; we had drawn his
fangs, and for all I cared he might go on with his politics and
dazzle the world with his gifts, provided he kept his hands out
of crime. I wrote and told him that; told him that the three
people who knew everything would hold their tongues, but that
they reserved the right to speak if he ever showed any sign of
running crooked. I had no reply and did not expect one. I had
lost all my hate for the man, and, so strangely are we made, what
I mostly felt was compassion. We are all, even the best of us,
egotists and self-deceivers, and without a little comfortable
make-believe to clothe us we should freeze in the outer winds. I
shuddered when I thought of the poor devil with his palace of
cards about his ears and his naked soul. I felt that further
triumph would be an offence against humanity.</p>

<p>He must have got my message, for in July he was back at his
work, and made a speech at a big political demonstration which
was highly commended in the papers. Whether he went about in
society I do not know, for Sandy was in Scotland and I was at
Fosse, and not inclined to leave it. . . . Meantime
Macgillivray's business was going on, and the Press was full of
strange cases, which no one seemed to think of connecting. I
gathered from Macgillivray that though the syndicate was smashed
to little bits he had failed to make the complete bag of
malefactors that he had hoped. In England there were three big
financial exposures followed by long sentences; in Paris there
was a first-rate political scandal and a crop of convictions; a
labour agitator and a copper magnate in the Middle West went to
gaol for life, and there was the famous rounding-up of the murder
gang in Turin. But Macgillivray and his colleagues, like me, had
success rather than victory; indeed in this world I don't think
you can get both at once--you must make your choice.</p>

<p>We saw Mercot at the "House" Ball at Oxford, none the worse
for his adventures, but rather the better, for he was a man now
and not a light-witted boy. Early in July Mary and I went to
Paris for Adela Victor's wedding, the most gorgeous show I have
ever witnessed, when I had the privilege of kissing the bride and
being kissed by the bridegroom. Sir Arthur Warcliff brought David
to pay us a visit at Fosse, where the boy fished from dawn to
dusk, and began to get some flesh on his bones. Archie Roylance
arrived and the pair took such a fancy to each other that the
three of them went off to Norway to have a look at the birds on
Flacksholm.</p>

<p>I was busy during those weeks making up arrears of time at
Fosse, for my long absence had put out the whole summer
programme. One day, as I was down in the Home Meadow, planning a
new outlet for one of the ponds, Sandy turned up, announcing that
he must have a talk with me and could only spare twenty
minutes.</p>

<p>"When does your tenancy of Machray begin?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I have got it now--ever since April. The sea-trout come early
there."</p>

<p>"And you can go up whenever you like?"</p>

<p>"Yes. We propose starting about the 5th of August."</p>

<p>"Take my advice and start at once," he said.</p>

<p>I asked why, though I guessed his reason.</p>

<p>"Because I'm not very happy about you here. You've insulted to
the marrow the vainest and one of the cleverest men in the world.
Don't imagine he'll take it lying down. You may be sure he is
spending sleepless nights planning how he is to get even with
you. It's you he is chiefly thinking about. Me he regards as a
rival in the same line of business--he'd love to break me, but
he'll trust to luck for the chance turning up. Lavater has been
his slave and has escaped--but at any rate he once acknowledged
his power. <i>You</i> have fooled him from start to finish and
left his vanity one raw throbbing sore. He won't be at ease till
he has had his revenge on you--on you and your wife."</p>

<p>"Peter John!" I exclaimed.</p>

<p>He shook his head. "No, I don't think so. He won't try that
line again--at any rate not yet awhile. But he would be much
happier, Dick, if you were dead."</p>

<p>The thought had been in my own mind for weeks, and had made me
pretty uncomfortable. It is not pleasant to walk in peril of your
life, and move about in constant expectation of your decease. I
had considered the thing very carefully, and had come to the
conclusion that I could do nothing but try to forget the risk. If
I ever allowed myself to think about it, my whole existence would
be poisoned. It was a most unpleasant affair, but after all the
world is full of hazards. I told Sandy that.</p>

<p>"I'm quite aware of the danger," I said. "I always reckoned
that as part of the price I had to pay for succeeding. But I'm
hanged if I'm going to allow the fellow to score off me to the
extent of disarranging my life."</p>

<p>"You've plenty of fortitude, old fellow," said Sandy, "but you
owe a duty to your family and your friends. Of course you might
get police protection from Macgillivray, but that would be an
infernal nuisance for you, and, besides, what kind of police
protection would avail against an enemy as subtle as Medina? . .
. No, I want you to go away. I want you to go to Machray now, and
stay there till the end of October."</p>

<p>"What good would that do? He can follow me there, if he wants
to, and anyhow the whole thing would begin again when I came
back."</p>

<p>"I'm not so sure," he said. "In three months' time his wounded
vanity may have healed. It's no part of his general game to have
a vendetta with you, and only a passion of injured pride would
drive him to it. Presently that must die down, and he will see
his real interest. Then as for Machray--why a Scotch deer-forest
is the best sanctuary on earth. Nobody can come up that long glen
without your hearing about it, and nobody can move on the hills
without half a dozen argus-eyed stalkers and gillies following
him. They're the right sort of police protection. I want you for
all our sakes to go to Machray at once."</p>

<p>"It looks like funking," I objected.</p>

<p>"Don't be an old ass. Is there any man alive, who is not a
raving maniac, likely to doubt your courage? You know perfectly
well that it is sometimes a brave man's duty to run away."</p>

<p>I thought for a bit. "I don't think he'll hire ruffians to
murder me," I said.</p>

<p>"Why."</p>

<p>"Because he challenged me to a duel. Proposed a place in the
Pyrenees and offered to let me choose both seconds."</p>

<p>"What did you reply?"</p>

<p>"I wired, 'Try not to be a fool.' It looks as if he wanted to
keep the job of doing me in for himself."</p>

<p>"Very likely, and that doesn't mend matters. I'd rather face
half a dozen cut-throats than Medina. What you tell me
strengthens my argument."</p>

<p>I was bound to admit that Sandy talked sense, and after he had
gone I thought the matter out and decided to take his advice.
Somehow the fact that he should have put my suspicions into words
made them more formidable, and I knew again the odious feeling of
the hunted. It was hardly fear, for I think that, if necessary, I
could have stayed on at Fosse and gone about my business with a
stiff lip. But all the peace of the place had been spoiled. If a
bullet might at any moment come from a covert--that was the crude
way I envisaged the risk--then good-bye to the charm of my summer
meadows.</p>

<p>The upshot was that I warned Tom Greenslade to be ready to
take his holiday, and by the 20th of July he and I and Mary and
Peter John were settled in a little white-washed lodge tucked
into the fold of a birch-clad hill, and looking alternately at a
shrunken river and a cloudless sky, while we prayed for rain.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Machray in calm weather is the most solitary place on earth,
lonelier and quieter even than a Boer farm lost in some hollow of
the veld. The mountains rise so sheer and high, that it seems
that only a bird could escape, and the road from the sea-loch ten
miles away is only a strip of heather-grown sand which looks as
if it would end a mile off at the feet of each steep
hill-shoulder. But when the gales come, and the rain is lashing
the roof, and the river swirls at the garden-edge, and the
birches and rowans are tossing, then a thousand voices talk, and
one lives in a world so loud that one's ears are deafened and
one's voice acquires a sharp pitch of protest from shouting
against the storm.</p>

<p>We had few gales, and the last week of July was a very fair
imitation of the Tropics. The hills were cloaked in a heat haze,
the Aicill river was a chain of translucent pools with a few
reddening salmon below the ledges, the burns were thin trickles,
the sun drew hot scents out of the heather and bog-myrtle, and
movement was a weariness to man and beast. That was for the
day-time; but every evening about five o'clock there would come a
light wind from the west, which scattered the haze, and left a
land swimming in cool amber light. Then Mary and Tom Greenslade
and I would take to the hills, and return well on for midnight to
a vast and shameless supper. Sometimes in the hot noontides I
went alone, with old Angus the head stalker, and long before the
season began I had got a pretty close knowledge of the
forest.</p>

<p>The reader must bear with me while I explain the lie of the
land. The twenty thousand acres of Machray extend on both sides
of the Aicill glen, but principally to the south. West lies the
Machray sea-loch, where the hills are low and green and mostly
sheep-ground. East, up to the river-head, is Glenaicill Forest,
the lodge of which is beyond the watershed on the shore of
another sea-loch, and on our side of the divide there is only a
stalker's cottage. Glenaicill is an enormous place, far too big
to be a single forest. It had been leased for years by Lord
Glenfinnan, an uncle of Archie Roylance, but he was a frail old
gentleman of over seventy who could only get a stag when they
came down to the low ground in October. The result was that the
place was ridiculously undershot, and all the western end, which
adjoined Machray, was virtually a sanctuary. It was a confounded
nuisance, for it made it impossible to stalk our northern beat
except in a south-west wind, unless you wanted to shift the deer
on to Glenaicill, and that beat had all our best grazing and
seemed to attract all our best heads.</p>

<p>Haripol Forest to the south was not so large, but I should
think it was the roughest ground in Scotland. Machray had good
beats south of the Aicill right up to the watershed, and two
noble corries, the Corrie-na-Sidhe and the Corrie Easain. Beyond
the watershed was the glen of the Reascuill, both sides of which
were Haripol ground. The Machray heights were all over the 3,000
feet, but rounded and fairly easy going, but the Haripol peaks
beyond the stream were desperate rock mountains--Stob B&aacute;n,
Stob Coire Easain, Sgurr Mor--comprising some of the most
difficult climbing in the British Isles. The biggest and hardest
top of all was at the head of the Reascuill--Sgurr Dearg, with
its two pinnacle ridges, its three prongs, and the awesome
precipice of its eastern face. Machray marched with Haripol on
its summit, but it wasn't often that any of our stalkers went
that way. All that upper part of the Reascuill was a series of
cliffs and chasms, and the red deer--who is no
rock-climber--rarely ventured there. For the rest these four
southern beats of ours were as delightful hunting-ground as I
have ever seen, and the ladies could follow a good deal of the
stalking by means of a big telescope in the library window of the
Lodge. Machray was a young man's forest, for the hills rose steep
almost from the sea-level, and you might have to go up and down
3,000 feet several times in a day. But Haripol--at least the
north and east parts of it--was fit only for athletes, and it
seemed to be its fate to fall to tenants who were utterly
incapable of doing it justice. In recent years it had been leased
successively to an elderly distiller, a young racing
ne'er-do-well who drank, and a plump American railway king. It
was now in the hands of a certain middle-aged Midland
manufacturer, Lord Claybody, who had won an easy fortune and an
easier peerage during the War. "Ach, he will be killed," Angus
said. "He will never get up a hundred feet of Haripol without
being killed." So I found myself, to my disgust, afflicted with
another unauthorised sanctuary.</p>

<p>Angus was very solemn about it. He was a lean anxious man,
just over fifty, with a face not unlike a stag's, amazingly fast
on the hills, a finished cragsman, and with all the Highlander's
subtle courtesy. Kennedy, the second stalker, was of Lowland
stock; his father had come to the North from Galloway in the days
of the boom in sheep, and had remained as a keeper when sheep
prices fell. He was a sturdy young fellow, apt to suffer on steep
slopes on a warm day, but strong as an ox and with a better head
than Angus for thinking out problems of weather and wind. Though
he had the Gaelic, he was a true Lowlander, plain-spoken and
imperturbable. It was a contrast of new and old, for Kennedy had
served in the War, and learned many things beyond the other's
ken. He knew, for example, how to direct your eye to the point he
wanted, and would give intelligent directions like a battery
observer, whereas with Angus it was always "D'ye see yon stone?
Ay, but d'ye see another stone?"--and so forth. Kennedy, when we
sat down to rest, would smoke a cigarette in a holder, while
Angus lit the dottle in a foul old pipe.</p>

<p>In the first fortnight of August we had alternate days of
rain, real drenching torrents, and the Aicill rose and let the
fish up from the sea. There were few sea-trout that year, but
there was a glorious run of salmon. Greenslade killed his first,
and by the end of a week had a bag of twelve, while Mary, with
the luck which seems to attend casual lady anglers, had four in
one day to her own rod. Those were pleasant days, though there
were mild damp afternoons when the midges were worse than
tropical mosquitoes. I liked it best when a breeze rose and the
sun was hot and we had all our meals by the waterside. Once at
luncheon we took with us an iron pot, made a fire, and boiled a
fresh-killed salmon "in his broo"--a device I recommend to anyone
who wants the full flavour of that noble fish.</p>

<p>Archie Roylance arrived on August 16th, full of the lust of
hunting. He reported that they had seen nothing remarkable in the
way of birds at Flacksholm, but that David Warcliff had had great
sport with the sea-trout. "There's a good boy for you," he
declared. "First-class little sportsman, and to see him and his
father together made me want to get wedded straight off. I
thought him a bit hipped at Fosse, but the North Sea put him
right, and I left him as jolly as a grig. By the way, what was
the matter with him in the summer? I gathered that he had been
seedy or something, and the old man can't let him out of his
sight. . . . Let's get in Angus, and talk deer."</p>

<p>Angus was ready to talk deer till all hours. I had fixed the
21st for the start of the season, though the beasts were in such
forward condition that we might have begun four days earlier.
Angus reported that he had already seen several stags clear of
velvet. But he was inclined to be doleful about our
neighbours.</p>

<p>"My uncle Alexander is past prayin' for," said Archie. "He
lives for that forest of his, and he won't have me there early in
the season, for he says I have no judgment about beasts and won't
listen to the stalkers. In October, you see, he has me under his
own eye. He refuses to let a stag be killed unless it's a hummel
or a diseased ancient. Result is, the place is crawlin' with fine
stags that have begun to go back and won't perish till they're
fairly moulderin'. Poor notion of a stud has my uncle Alexander.
. . . What about Haripol? Who has it this year?"</p>

<p>When he heard he exclaimed delightedly. "I know old Claybody.
Rather a good old fellow in his way, and uncommon free-handed.
Rum old bird, too! He once introduced his son to me as 'The
Honourable Johnson Claybody.' Fairly wallows in his peerage. You
know he wanted to take the title of Lord Oxford, because he had a
boy goin' up to Magdalen, but even the Heralds' College jibbed at
that. But he'll never get up those Haripol hills. He's a little
fat puffin' old man. I'm not very spry on my legs now, but
compared to Claybody I'm a gazelle."</p>

<p>"He'll maybe have veesitors," said Angus.</p>

<p>"You bet he will. He'll have the Lodge stuffed with young men,
for there are various Honourable Claybody daughters. Don't fancy
they'll be much good on the hill, though."</p>

<p>"They will not be good, Sir Archibald," said the melancholy
Angus. "There will have been some of them on the hill already.
They will be no better than towrists."</p>

<p>"Towrists" I should explain were the poison in Angus's cup. By
that name he meant people who trespassed on a deer forest during,
or shortly before, the stalking season, and had not the good
manners to give him notice and ask his consent. He distinguished
them sharply from what he called "muntaneers," a class which he
respected, for they were modest and civil folk who came usually
with ropes and ice axes early in the spring, and were accustomed
to feast off Angus's ham and eggs and thaw their frozen limbs by
Angus's fire. If they came at other seasons it was after
discussing their routes with Angus. They went where no deer could
travel, and spent their time, as he said, "shamming themselves
into shimneys." But the "towrist" was blatant and foolish and
abundantly discourteous. He tramped, generally in a noisy party,
over deer-ground, and, if remonstrated with, became truculent. A
single member of the species could wreck the stalking on a beat
for several days. "The next I see on Machray," said Angus, "I
will be rolling down a big stone on him." Some of the Haripol
guests, it appeared, were of this malign breed, and had been
wandering thoughtlessly over the forest, thereby wrecking their
own sport--and mine.</p>

<p>"They will have Alan Macnicol's heart broke," he concluded.
"And Alan was saying to me that they was afful bad shots. They
was shooting at a big stone and missing it. And they will have
little ponies to ride on up to the tops, for the creatures is no
use at walking. I hope they will fall down and break their
necks."</p>

<p>"They can't all be bad shots," said Archie. "By the way, Dick,
I forgot to tell you. You know Medina, Dominick Medina? You once
told me you knew him. Well, I met him on the steamer, and he said
he was going to put in a week with old Claybody."</p>

<p>That piece of news took the light out of the day for me. If
Medina was at Haripol it was most certainly with a purpose. I had
thought little about the matter since I arrived at Machray, for
the place had an atmosphere of impregnable seclusion, and I
seemed to have shut a door on my recent life. I had fallen into a
mood of content and whole-hearted absorption in the ritual of
wild sport. But now my comfort vanished. I looked up at the grim
wall of hills towards Haripol and wondered what mischief was
hatching behind it.</p>

<p>I warned Angus and Kennedy and the gillies to keep a good
look-out for trespassers. Whenever one was seen, they were to get
their glasses on him and follow him and report his appearance and
doings to me. Then I went out alone to shoot a brace of grouse
for the pot, and considered the whole matter very carefully. I
had an instinct that Medina had come to these parts to have a
reckoning with me, and I was determined not to shirk it. I could
not go on living under such a menace; I must face it and reach a
settlement. To Mary, of course, I could say nothing, and I saw no
use in telling either Archie or Greenslade. It was,
metaphorically, and perhaps literally, my own funeral. But next
morning I did not go fishing. Instead, I stayed at home and wrote
out a full account of the whole affair up to Medina's appearance
at Haripol, and I set down baldly what I believed to be his
purpose. This was in case I went out one day and did not return.
When I finished it, I put the document in my dispatch-box, and
felt easier, as a man feels when he has made his will. I only
hoped the time of waiting would not be prolonged.</p>

<p>The 21st was a glorious blue day, with a morning haze which
promised heat. What wind there was came from the south-east, so I
sent Archie out on the Corrie Easain beat, and went myself, with
one gillie, to Clach Glas, which is the western peak on the north
bank of the Aicill. I made a practice of doing my own stalking,
and by this time I knew the ground well enough to do it safely. I
saw two shootable stags, and managed to get within range of one
of them, but spared him for the good of the forest, as he was a
young beast whose head would improve. I had a happy and peaceful
day, and found to my relief that I wasn't worrying about the
future. The clear air and the great spaces seemed to have given
me the placid fatalism of an Arab.</p>

<p>When I returned I was greeted by Mary with the news that
Archie had got a stag, and that she had followed most of his
stalk through the big telescope. Archie himself arrived just
before dinner, very cheerful and loquacious. He found that his
game leg made him slow, but he declared that he was not in the
least tired. At dinner we had to listen to every detail of his
day, and we had a sweep on the beast's weight, which Mary won.
Afterwards in the smoking-room he told me more.</p>

<p>"Those infernal tailors from Haripol were out to-day. Pretty
wild shots they must be. When we were lunchin' a spent bullet
whistled over our heads--a long way off, to be sure, but I call
it uncommon bad form. You should have heard Angus curse in
Gaelic. Look here, Dick, I've a good mind to drop a line to old
Claybody and ask him to caution his people. The odds are a
million to one, of course, against their doin' any harm, but
there's always that millionth chance. I had a feelin' to-day as
if the War had started over again."</p>

<p>I replied that if anything of the sort happened a second time
I would certainly protest, but I pretended to make light of it,
as a thing only possible with that particular brand of wind. But
I realised now what Medina's plans were. He had been tramping
about Haripol, getting a notion of the lie of the land, and I
knew that he had a big-game hunter's quick eye for country. He
had fostered the legend of wild shooting among the Haripol
guests, and probably he made himself the wildest of the lot. The
bullet which sang over Archie's head was a proof, but he waited
on the chance of a bullet which would not miss. If a tragedy
happened, everyone would believe it was a pure accident, there
would be heart-broken apologies, and, though Sandy and one or two
others would guess the truth, nothing could be proved, and in any
case it wouldn't help <i>me. . . .</i> Of course I could stalk
only on the north beats of Machray, but the idea no sooner
occurred to me than I dismissed it. I must end this hideous
suspense. I must accept Medina's challenge and somehow or other
reach a settlement.</p>

<p>When Angus came in for orders, I told him that I was going
stalking on the Corrie-na-Sidhe beat the day after to-morrow, and
I asked him to send word privately to Alan Macnicol at
Haripol.</p>

<p>"It will be no use, sir," he groaned. "The veesitors will no
heed Alan."</p>

<p>But I told him to send word nevertheless. I wanted to give
Medina the chance he sought. It was my business to draw his
fire.</p>

<p>Next day we slacked and fished. In the afternoon I went a
little way up the hill called Clach Glas, from which I could get
a view of the ground on the south side of the Aicill. It was a
clear quiet day, with the wind steady in the south-east, and
promising to continue there. The great green hollow of
Corrie-na-Sidhe was clear in every detail; much of it looked like
a tennis-court, but I knew that what seemed smooth sward was
really matted blaeberries and hidden boulders, and that the
darker patches were breast-high bracken and heather. Corrie
Easain I could not see, for it was hidden by the long spur of
Bheinn Fhada, over which peeped the cloven summit of Sgurr Dearg.
I searched all the ground with my glasses, and picked up several
lots of hinds, and a few young stags, but there was no sign of
human activity. There seemed to be a rifle out, however, on
Glenaicill Forest, for I heard two far-away shots towards the
north-east. I lay a long time amid the fern, with bees humming
around me and pipits calling, and an occasional buzzard or
peregrine hovering in the blue, thinking precisely the same
thoughts that I used to have in France the day before a big
action. It was not exactly nervousness that I felt, but a sense
that the foundations of everything had got loose, and that the
world had become so insecure that I had better draw down the
blinds on hoping and planning and everything, and become a log. I
was very clear in my mind that next day was going to bring the
crisis.</p>

<p>Of course I didn't want Mary to suspect, but I forgot to
caution Archie, and that night at dinner, as ill luck would have
it, he mentioned that Medina was at Haripol. I could see her eyes
grow troubled, for I expect she had been having the same anxiety
as myself those past weeks, and had been too proud to declare it.
As we were going to bed she asked me point-blank what it meant.
"Nothing in the world," I said. "He is a great stalker and a
friend of the Claybodys. I don't suppose he has the remotest idea
that I am here. Anyhow that affair is all over. He is not going
to cross our path if he can help it. The one wish in his heart is
to avoid us."</p>

<p>She appeared to be satisfied, but I don't know how much she
slept that night. I never woke till six o'clock, but when I
opened my eyes I felt too big a load on my heart to let me stay
in bed, so I went down to the Garden Pool and had a swim. That
invigorated me, and indeed it was not easy to be depressed in
that gorgeous morning, with the streamers of mist still clinging
to the high tops, and the whole glen a harmony of singing birds
and tumbling waters. I noticed that the wind, what there was of
it, seemed to have shifted more to the east--a very good quarter
for the Corrie-na-Sidhe beat.</p>

<p>Angus and Kennedy were waiting outside the smoking-room, and
even the pessimism of the head stalker was mellowed by the
weather. "I think," he said slowly, "we will be getting a sta-ag.
There was a big beast on Bheinn Fhada yesterday--Kennedy seen
him--a great beast he was--maybe nineteen stone, but Kennedy
never right seen his head. . . . We'd better be moving on,
sir."</p>

<p>Mary whispered in my ear. "There's no danger, Dick? You're
sure?" I have never heard her voice more troubled.</p>

<p>"Not a scrap," I laughed. "It's an easy day and I ought to be
back for tea. You'll be able to follow me all the time through
the big telescope."</p>

<p>We started at nine. As I left, I had a picture of Greenslade
sitting on a garden-seat busy with fly-casts, and Archie smoking
his pipe and reading a three-days-old <i>Times,</i> and Peter
John going off with his nurse, and Mary looking after me with a
curious tense gaze. Behind, the smoke of the chimneys was rising
straight into the still air, and the finches were twittering
among the Prince Charlie roses. The sight gave me a pang. I might
never enter my little kingdom again. Neither wife nor friends
could help me: it was my own problem, which I must face
alone.</p>

<p>We crossed the bridge, and began to plod upwards through a
wood of hazels. In such fashion I entered upon the strangest day
of my life.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<h2>I</h2>

<h2>9 A.M. TO 2.15 P.M.</h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Obviously I could make no plan, and I had no clear idea in my
head as to what kind of settlement I wanted with Medina. I was
certain that I should find him somewhere on the hill, and that,
if he got a chance, he would try to kill me. The odds were, of
course, against his succeeding straight off, but escape was not
what I sought--I must get rid of this menace for ever. I don't
think that I wanted to kill him, but indeed I never tried to
analyse my feelings. I was obeying a blind instinct, and letting
myself drift on the tides of fate.</p>

<p>Corrie-na-Sidhe is an upper corrie, separated from the Aicill
valley by a curtain of rock and scree which I dare say was once
the moraine of a glacier and down which the Alt-na-Sidhe tumbled
in a fine chain of cascades. So steep is its fall that no fish
can ascend it, so that, while at the foot it is full of sizable
trout, in the Corrie itself it holds nothing, as Greenslade
reported, but little dark fingerlings. It was very warm as we
mounted the chaos of slabs and boulders, where a very sketchy and
winding track had been cut for bringing down the deer. Only the
toughest kind of pony could make that ascent. Though the day was
young the heat was already great, and the glen behind us swam in
a glassy sheen. Kennedy, as usual, mopped his brow and grunted,
but the lean Angus strode ahead as if he were on the flat.</p>

<p>At the edge of the corrie we halted for a spy. Deep hollows
have a trick of drawing the wind, and such faint currents of air
as I could detect seemed to be coming on our left rear from the
north-east. Angus was positive, however, that though the south
had gone out of the wind, it was pretty well due east, with no
north in it, and maintained that when we were farther up the
corrie we would have it fair on our left cheek. We were not long
in finding beasts. There was a big drove of hinds on the right
bank of the burn, and another lot, with a few small stags, on the
left bank, well up on the face of Bheinn Fhada. But there was
nothing shootable there.</p>

<p>"The big stags will be all on the high tops," said Angus. "We
must be getting up to the burnhead."</p>

<p>It was easier said than done, for there were the hinds to be
circumvented, so we had to make a long circuit far up the hill
called Clonlet, which is the westernmost of the Machray tops
south of the Aicill. It was rough going, for we mounted to about
the 3,000 feet level, and traversed the hill-side just under the
upper scarp of rock. Presently we were looking down upon the cup
which was the head of the corrie, and over the col could see the
peak of Stob Coire Easain and the ridge of Stob B&aacute;n, both
on Haripol and beyond the Reascuill. We had another spy, and made
out two small lots of stags on the other side of the
Alt-na-Sidhe. They were too far off to get a proper view of them,
but one or two looked good beasts, and I decided to get
nearer.</p>

<p>We had to make a cautious descent of the hill-side in case of
deer lying in pockets, for the place was seamed with gullies.
Before we were half-way down I got my telescope on one of the
lots, and picked out a big stag with a poor head, which clearly
wanted shooting. Angus agreed, and we started down a sheltering
ravine to get to the burnside. The sight of a quarry made me
forget everything else, and for the next hour and a half I hadn't
a thought in the world except how to get within range of that
beast. One stalk is very much like another, and I am not going to
describe this. The only trouble came from a small stag in our
rear, which had come over Clonlet and got the scent of our track
on the hill-face. This unsettled him and he went off at a great
pace towards the top of the burn. I thought at first that the
brute would go up Bheinn Fhada and carry off our lot with him,
but he came to a halt, changed his mind, and made for the Haripol
march and the col.</p>

<p>After that it was plain sailing. We crawled up the right of
the Alt-na-Sidhe, which was first-class cover, and then turned up
a tributary gully which came down from Bheinn Fhada. Indeed the
whole business was too simple to be of much interest to anyone,
except the man with the rifle. When I judged I was about the
latitude of my stag, I crept out of the burn and reached a
hillock from which I had a good view of him. The head, as I
suspected, was poor--only nine points, though the horns were of
the rough, thick, old Highland type, but the body was heavy, and
he was clearly a back-going beast. After a wait of some twenty
minutes he got up and gave me a chance at about two hundred
yards, and I dropped him dead with a shot in the neck, which was
the only part of him clear.</p>

<p>It was for me the first stag of the season, and it is always a
pleasant moment when the tension relaxes and you light your pipe
and look around you. As soon as the gralloch was over I proposed
lunch, and we found for the purpose a little nook by a spring. We
were within a few hundred yards of the Haripol march, which there
does not run along the watershed but crosses the corrie about
half a mile below the col. In the old days of sheep there had
been a fence, the decaying posts of which could be observed a
little way off on a knoll. Between the fence and the col lay some
very rough ground, where the Alt-na-Sidhe had its source, ground
so broken that it was impossible, without going a good way up the
hill, to see from it the watershed ridge.</p>

<p>I finished Mary's stuffed scones and ginger biscuits, and had
a drink of whisky and spring water, while Angus and Kennedy ate
their lunch a few yards off in the heather. I was just lighting
my pipe, when a sound made me pause with the match in my hand. A
rifle bullet sang over my head. It was not very near--fifty feet
or so above me, and a little to the left.</p>

<p>"The tamned towrists!" I heard Angus exclaim.</p>

<p>I knew it was Medina as certainly as if I had seen him. He was
somewhere in the rough ground between the Haripol march and the
col--probably close to the col, for the sound of the report
seemed to come from a good way off. He could not have been aiming
at me, for I was perfectly covered, but he must have seen me when
I stalked the stag. He had decided that his chance was not yet
come, and the shot was camouflage--to keep up the reputation of
Haripol for wild shooting.</p>

<p>"It would be the staggie that went over the march," grunted
Angus. "The towrists--to be shooting at such a wee beast!"</p>

<p>I had suddenly made up my mind. I would give Medina the
opportunity he sought. I would go and look for him.</p>

<p>I got up and stretched my legs. "I'm going to try a stalk on
my own," I told Angus. "I'll go over to Corrie Easain. You had
better pull this beast down to the burnside, and then fetch the
pony. You might send Hughie and the other pony up Glenaicill to
the Mad Burn. If I get a stag I'll gralloch him and get him down
somehow to the burn, so tell Hughie to look out for my signal.
I'll wave a white handkerchief. The wind is backing round to the
north, Angus. It should be all right for Corrie Easain, if I take
it from the south."</p>

<p>"It would be better for Sgurr Dearg," said Angus, "but that's
ower far. Have you the cartridges, sir?"</p>

<p>"Plenty," I said, patting a side pocket. "Give me that spare
rope, Kennedy. I'll want it for hauling down my stag, if I get
one."</p>

<p>I put my little .240 into its cover, nodded to the men, and
turned down the gully to the main burn. I wasn't going to appear
on the bare hill-side so long as it was possible for Medina to
have a shot at me. But soon a ridge shut off the view from the
Haripol ground, and I then took a slant up the face of Bheinn
Fhada.</p>

<p>Mary had spent most of the morning at the big telescope in the
library window. She saw us reach the rim of the corrie and lost
us when we moved up the side of Clonlet. We came into view again
far up the corrie, and she saw the stalk and the death of the
stag. Then she went to luncheon, but hastened back in the middle
of it in time to see me scrambling alone among the screes of
Bheinn Fhada. At first she was reassured because she thought I
was coming home. But when she realised that I was mounting higher
and was making for Corrie Easain her heart sank, and, when I had
gone out of view, she could do nothing but range miserably about
the garden.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>II</h2>

<h2>2.15 P.M. TO ABOUT 5 P.M.</h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>It was very hot on Bheinn Fhada, for I was out of the wind,
but when I reached the ridge and looked down on Corrie Easain I
found a fair breeze, which had certainly more north than east in
it. There was not a cloud in the sky, and every top for miles
round stood out clear, except the Haripol peaks which were shut
off by the highest part of the ridge I stood on. Corrie Easain
lay far below--not a broad cup like Corrie-na-Sidhe, but a deep
gash in the hills, inclined at such an angle that the stream in
it was nothing but white water. We called it the Mad Burn--its
Gaelic name, I think, was the Alt-a-mhuillin--and half-way up and
just opposite me a tributary, the Red Burn, came down from the
cliffs of Sgurr Dearg. I could see the northern peak of that
mountain, a beautiful cone of rock, rising like the Matterhorn
from its glacis of scree.</p>

<p>I argued that Medina would have seen me going up Bheinn Fhada
and would assume that I was bound for Corrie Easain. He would
re-cross the col and make for the Haripol side of the
<i>beallach</i> which led from that corrie to the Reascuill. Now
I wanted to keep the higher ground, where I could follow his
movements, so it was my aim to get to the watershed ridge looking
down on Haripol before he did. The wind was a nuisance, for it
was blowing from me and would move any deer towards him, thereby
giving him a clue to my whereabouts. So I thought that if I could
once locate him, I must try to get the lee side of him. At that
time I think I had a vague notion of driving him towards
Machray.</p>

<p>I moved at my best pace along the east face of Bheinn Fhada
towards the <i>beallach</i>--which was a deep rift in the grey
rock-curtain through which deer could pass. My only feeling was
excitement, such as I had never known before in any stalk. I
slipped and sprawled among the slabs, slithered over the screes,
had one or two awkward traverses round the butt-end of cliffs,
but in about twenty minutes I was at the point where the
<i>massif</i> of Bheinn Fhada joined the watershed ridge. The
easy way was now to get on to the ridge, but I dared not appear
on the sky-line, so I made a troublesome journey along the near
side of the ridge-wall, sometimes out on the face of sheer
precipices, but more often involved in a chaos of loose boulders
which were the debris of the upper rocks. I was forced pretty far
down, and eventually struck the <i>beallach</i> path about five
hundred feet below the summit.</p>

<p>At the crest I found I had no view of the Reascuill
valley--only a narrow corrie blocked by a shoulder of hill and
the bald top of Stob Coire Easain beyond. A prospect I must have,
so I turned east along the watershed ridge in the direction of
Sgurr Dearg. I was by this time very warm, for I had come at a
brisk pace; I had a rifle to carry, and had Angus's rope round my
shoulders like a Swiss guide; I was wearing an old grey suit,
which, with bluish stockings, made me pretty well invisible on
that hill-side. Presently as I mounted the ridge, keeping of
course under the sky-line, I came to a place where a lift of rock
enabled me to clear the spurs and command a mile or so of the
Reascuill.</p>

<p>The place was on the sky-line, bare and exposed, and I crawled
to the edge where I could get a view. Below me, after a few
hundred yards of rocks and scree, I saw a long tract of bracken
and deep heather sweeping down to the stream. Medina, I made
sure, was somewhere thereabouts, watching the ridge. I calculated
that, with his re-crossing of the col at the head of
Corrie-na-Sidhe and his working round the south end of Bheinn
Fhada, he could not have had time to get to the <i>beallach,</i>
or near the <i>beallach,</i> before me, and must still be on the
lower ground. Indeed I hoped to catch sight of him, for, while I
was assured he was pursuing me, he could not know that I was
after him, and might be off his guard.</p>

<p>But there was no sign of life in that sunny stretch of green
and purple, broken by the grey of boulders. I searched it with my
glass and could see no movement except pipits, and a curlew by a
patch of bog. Then it occurred to me to show myself. He must be
made to know that I had accepted his challenge.</p>

<p>I stood up straight on the edge of the steep, and decided to
remain standing till I had counted fifty. It was an insane thing
to do, I dare say, but I was determined to force the pace. . . .
I had got to forty-one without anything happening. Then a sudden
instinct made me crouch and step aside. That movement was my
salvation. There was a sound like a twanged fiddle-string, and a
bullet passed over my left shoulder. I felt the wind of it on my
cheek.</p>

<p>The next second I was on my back wriggling below the sky-line.
Once there I got to my feet and ran--up the ridge on my left to
get a view from higher ground. The shot, so far as I could judge,
had come from well below and a little to the east of where I had
been standing. I found another knuckle of rock, and crept to the
edge of it, so that I looked from between two boulders into the
glen.</p>

<p>The place was still utterly quiet. My enemy was hidden there,
probably not half a mile off, but there was nothing to reveal his
presence. The light wind stirred the bog cotton, a merlin sailed
across to Stob Coire Easain, a raven croaked in the crags, but
these were the only sounds. There was not even a sign of
deer.</p>

<p>My glass showed that half-way down an old ewe was feeding--one
of those melancholy beasts which stray into a forest from
adjacent sheep-ground, and lead a precarious life among the
rocks, lean and matted and wild, till some gillie cuts their
throats. They are far sharper-eyed and quicker of hearing than a
stag, and an unmitigated curse to the stalker. The brute was
feeding on a patch of turf near a big stretch of bracken, and
suddenly I saw her raise her head and stare. It was the first
time I had ever felt well disposed towards a sheep.</p>

<p>She was curious about something in a shallow gully which
flanked the brackens, and so was I. I kept my glass glued on her,
and saw her toss her disreputable head, stamp her foot, and then
heard her whistle through her nose. This was a snag Medina could
not have reckoned with. He was clearly in that gully, working his
way upward in its cover, unwitting that the ewe was giving him
away. I argued that he must want to reach the high ground as soon
as possible. He had seen me on the ridge, and must naturally
conclude that I had beaten a retreat. My first business,
therefore, was to reassure him.</p>

<p>I got my rifle out of its cover, which I stuffed into my
pocket. There was a little patch of gravel just on the lip of the
gully, and I calculated that he would emerge beside it, under the
shade of a blaeberry-covered stone. I guessed right . . . I saw
first an arm, and then a shoulder part the rushes, and presently
a face which peered up-hill. My glass showed me that the face was
Medina's, very red, and dirty from contact with the peaty soil.
He slowly reached for his glass, and began to scan the
heights.</p>

<p>I don't know what my purpose was at this time, if indeed I had
any purpose. I didn't exactly mean to kill him, I think, though I
felt it might come to that. Vaguely I wanted to put him out of
action, to put the fear of God into him, and make him come to
terms. Of further consequences I never thought. But now I had one
clear intention--to make him understand that I accepted his
challenge.</p>

<p>I put a bullet neatly into the centre of the patch of gravel,
and then got my glass on it. He knew the game all right. In a
second like a weasel he was back in the gully.</p>

<p>I reckoned that now I had my chance. Along the ridge I went,
mounting fast, and keeping always below the skyline. I wanted to
get to the lee side of him and so be able to stalk him up-wind,
and I thought that I had an opportunity now to turn the head of
the Reascuill by one of the steep corries which descend from
Sgurr Dearg. Looking back, it all seems very confused and
amateurish, for what could I hope to do, even if I had the lee
side, beyond killing or wounding him? and I had a chance of that
as long as I had the upper ground. But in the excitement of the
chase the mind does not take long views, and I was enthralled by
the crazy sport of the thing. I did not feel any fear, because I
was not worrying about consequences.</p>

<p>Soon I came to the higher part of the ridge and saw frowning
above me the great rock face of Sgurr Dearg. I saw, too, a thing
I had forgotten. There was no way up that mountain direct from
the ridge, for the tower rose as perpendicular as a house-wall.
To surmount it a man must traverse on one side or the other--on
the Machray side by a scree slope, or on the Haripol side by a
deep gully which formed the top of the corrie into which I was
now looking. Across that corrie was the first of the great
buttresses which Sgurr Dearg sends down to the Reascuill. It was
the famous Pinnacle Ridge (as mountaineers called it); I had
climbed it three weeks before and found it pretty stiff; but then
I had kept the ridge all the way from the valley bottom, and I
did not see any practicable road up the corrie face of it, which
seemed nothing but slabs and rotten rocks, while the few chimneys
had ugly overhangs.</p>

<p>I lay flat and reconnoitred. What was Medina likely to do?
After my shot he could not follow up the ridge--the cover was too
poor on the upper slopes. I reasoned that he would keep on in the
broken ground up the glen till he reached this corrie, and try to
find a road to the high ground either by the corrie itself or by
one of the spurs. In that case it was my business to wait for
him. But first I thought I had better put a fresh clip in my
magazine, for the shot I had fired had been the last cartridge in
the old clip.</p>

<p>It was now that I made an appalling discovery. I had felt my
pockets and told Angus that I had plenty of cartridges. So I had,
but they didn't fit. . . . I remembered that two days before I
had lent Archie my .240 and had been shooting with a Mannlicher.
What I had in my pocket were Mannlicher clips left over from that
day. . . . I might chuck my rifle away, for it was no more use
than a poker.</p>

<p>At first I was stunned by the fatality. Here was I, engaged in
a duel on a wild mountain with one of the best shots in the
world, and I had lost my gun! The sensible course would have been
to go home. There was plenty of time for that, and long before
Medina reached the ridge I could be in cover in the gorge of the
Mad Burn. But that way out of it never occurred to me. I had
chosen to set the course, and the game must be played out here
and now. But I confess I was pretty well in despair and could see
no plan. I think I had a faint hope of protracting the thing till
dark and then trusting to my hill-craft to get even with him, but
I had an unpleasant feeling that he was not likely to oblige me
with so long a delay.</p>

<p>I forced myself to think, and decided that Medina would either
come up the corrie or take the steep spur which formed the
right-hand side of it and ran down to the Reascuill. The second
route would give him cover, but also render him liable to a
surprise at close quarters if I divined his intention, for I
might suddenly confront him four yards off at the top of one of
the pitches. He would therefore prefer the corrie, which was
magnificently broken up with rocks, and seamed with ravines, and
at the same time gave a clear view of all the higher ground.</p>

<p>With my face in a clump of louse-wort I raked the place with
my glass; and to my delight saw deer feeding about half-way down
in the right-hand corner. Medina could not ascend the corrie
without disturbing these deer--a batch of some thirty hinds, with
five small and two fairish stags among them. Therefore I was
protected from that side, and had only the ridge to watch.</p>

<p>But as I lay there I thought of another plan. Medina, I was
pretty certain, would try the corrie first, and would not see the
deer till he was well inside it, for they were on a kind of
platform which hid them from below. Opposite me across the narrow
corrie rose the great black wall of the Pinnacle Ridge, with the
wind blowing from me towards it. I remembered a trick which Angus
had taught me--how a stalker might have his wind carried against
the face of an opposite mountain and then, so to speak, reflected
from it and brought back to his own side, so that deer below him
would get it and move away from it up <i>towards him.</i> If I
let my scent be carried to the Pinnacle Ridge and diverted back,
it would move the deer on the platform up the corrie towards me.
It would be a faint wind, so they would move slowly away from
it--no doubt towards a gap under the tower of Sgurr Dearg which
led to the little corrie at the head of the Red Burn. We never
stalked that corrie, because it was impossible to get a stag out
of it without cutting him up, so the place was a kind of
sanctuary to which disturbed deer would naturally resort.</p>

<p>I stood on the sky-line, being confident that Medina could not
yet be within sight, and let the wind, which was now stronger and
nearly due north, ruffle my hair. I did this for about five
minutes, and then lay down to watch the result, with my glass on
the deer. Presently I saw them become restless, first the hinds
and then the small stags lifting their heads and looking towards
the Pinnacle Ridge. Soon a little fellow trotted a few yards
up-hill; then a couple of hinds moved after him; and then by a
sudden and simultaneous impulse the whole party began to drift up
the corrie. It was a quiet steady advance; they were not scared,
only a little doubtful. I saw with satisfaction that their
objective seemed to be the gap which led over to the Red
Burn.</p>

<p>Medina must see this and would assume that wherever I was I
was not ahead of the deer. He might look for me on the other
side, but more likely would follow the beasts so as to get the
high ground. Once there he could see my movements, whether I was
on the slopes of the Pinnacle Ridge, or down on the Machray side.
He would consider no doubt that his marksmanship was so
infinitely better than mine that he had only to pick me out from
the landscape to make an end of the business.</p>

<p>What I exactly intended I do not know. I had a fleeting notion
of lying hidden and surprising him, but the chances against that
were about a million to one, and even if I got him at close
quarters he was armed and I was not. I moved a little to the
right so as to keep my wind from the deer, and waited with a
chill beginning to creep over my spirit. . . . My watch told me
it was five o'clock. Mary and Peter John would be having tea
among the Prince Charlie roses, and Greenslade and Archie coming
up from the river. It would be heavenly at Machray now among
greenery and the cool airs of evening. Up here there was
loveliness enough, from the stars of butterwort and grass of
Parnassus by the wellheads to the solemn tops of Sgurr Dearg, the
colour of stormy waves against a faint turquoise sky. But I knew
now that the beauty of earth depends on the eye of the beholder,
for suddenly the clean airy world around me had grown leaden and
stifling.</p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h2>III</h2>

<h2>5 P.M. TO ABOUT 7.30 P.M.</h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>It was a good hour before he came. I had guessed rightly, and
he had made the deduction I hoped for. He was following the deer
towards the gap, assuming that I was on the Machray side. I was
in a rushy hollow at a junction of the main ridge and the spur I
have mentioned, and I could see him clearly as, with immense
circumspection and the use of every scrap of cover, he made his
way up the corrie. Once he was over the watershed, I would
command him from the higher ground and have the wind to my
vantage. I had some hope now, for I ought to be able to keep him
on the hill till the light failed, when my superior local
knowledge would come to my aid. He must be growing tired, I
reflected, for he had had far more ground to cover. For myself I
felt that I could go on for ever.</p>

<p>That might have been the course of events but for a second
sheep. Sgurr Dearg had always been noted for possessing a few
sheep even on its high rocks--infernal tattered outlaws, strays
originally from some decent flock, but now to all intents a new
species, unclassified by science. How they lived and bred I knew
not, but there was a legend of many a good stalk ruined by their
diabolical cunning. I heard something between a snort and a
whistle behind me, and, screwing my head round, saw one of these
confounded animals poised on a rock and looking in my direction.
It could see me perfectly, too, for on that side I had no
cover.</p>

<p>I lay like a mouse watching Medina. He was about half a mile
off, almost on the top of the corrie, and he had halted for a
rest and a spy. I prayed fervently that he would not see the
sheep.</p>

<p>He heard it. The brute started its whistling and coughing, and
a novice could have seen that it suspected something and knew
where that something was. I observed him get his glass on my
lair, though from the place where he was he could see nothing but
rushes. Then he seemed to make up his mind and suddenly
disappeared from view.</p>

<p>I knew what he was after. He had dropped into a scaur, which
would take him to the sky-line and enable him to come down on me
from above, while he himself would be safe from my
observation.</p>

<p>There was nothing to do but to clear out. The spur dropping to
the Reascuill seemed to give me the best chance, so I started
off, crouching and crawling, to get round the nose of it and on
to the steep glen-ward face. It was a miserable job till I had
turned the corner, for I expected every moment a bullet in my
back. Nothing happened, however, and soon I was slithering down
awesome slabs on to insecure ledges of heather. I am a fairly
experienced mountaineer, and a lover of rock, but I dislike
vegetation mixed up with a climb, and I had too much of it now.
There was perhaps a thousand feet of that spur, and I think I
must hold the speed record for its descent. Scratched, bruised,
and breathless, I came to anchor on a bed of screes, with the
infant Reascuill tumbling below me, and beyond it, a quarter of a
mile off, the black cliffs of the Pinnacle Ridge.</p>

<p>But what was my next step to be? The position was reversed.
Medina was above me with a rifle, and my own weapon was useless.
He must find out the road I had taken and would be after me like
a flame. . . . It was no good going down the glen; in the open
ground he would get the chance of twenty shots. It was no good
sticking to the spur or the adjacent ridge, for the cover was
bad. I could not hide for long in the corrie. . . . Then I looked
towards the Pinnacle Ridge and considered that, once I got into
those dark couloirs, I might be safe. The Psalmist had turned to
the hills for his help--I had better look to the rocks.</p>

<p>I had a quarter of a mile of open to cross, and a good deal
more if I was to reach the ridge at a point easy of ascent. There
were chimneys in front of me, deep black gashes, but my
recollection of them was that they had looked horribly difficult,
and had been plentifully supplied with overhangs. Supposing I got
into one of them and stuck. Medina would have me safe enough. . .
. But I couldn't wait to think. With an ugly cold feeling in my
inside I got into the ravine of the burn, and had a long drink
from a pool. Then I started down-stream, keeping close to the
right-hand bank, which mercifully was high and dotted with rowan
saplings. And as I went I was always turning my head to see
behind and above me what I feared.</p>

<p>I think Medina, who of course did not know about my rifle, may
have suspected a trap, for he came on slowly, and when I caught
sight of him it was not on the spur I had descended but farther
up the corrie. Two things I now realised. One was that I could
not make the easy end of the Pinnacle Ridge without exposing
myself on some particularly bare ground. The other was that to my
left in the Ridge was a deep gully which looked climbable.
Moreover, the foot of that gully was not a hundred yards from the
burn, and the mouth was so deep that a man would find shelter as
soon as he entered it.</p>

<p>For the moment I could not see Medina, and I don't think he
had yet caught sight of me. There was a trickle of water coming
down from the gully to the burn, and that gave me an apology for
cover. I ground my nose into the flowe-moss and let the water
trickle down my neck, as I squirmed my way up, praying hard that
my enemy's eyes might be sealed.</p>

<p>I think I had got about half-way, when a turn gave me a view
of the corrie, and there was Medina halted and looking towards
me. By the mercy of Providence my boots were out of sight, and my
head a little lower than my shoulders, so that I suppose among
the sand and gravel and rushes I must have been hard to detect.
Had he used his telescope I think he must have spotted me, though
I am not certain. I saw him staring. I saw him half-raise his
rifle to his shoulder, while I heard my heart thump. Then he
lowered his weapon, and moved out of sight.</p>

<p>Two minutes later I was inside the gully.</p>

<p>The place ran in like a cave with a sandy floor, and then came
a steep pitch of rock, while the sides narrowed into a chimney.
This was not very difficult. I swung myself up into the second
storey, and found that the cleft was so deep that the back wall
was about three yards from the opening, so that I climbed in
almost complete darkness and in perfect safety from view. This
went on for about fifty feet, and then, after a rather awkward
chockstone, I came to a fork. The branch on the left looked
hopeless, while that on the right seemed to offer some chances.
But I stopped to consider, for I remembered something.</p>

<p>I remembered that this was the chimney which I had prospected
three weeks before when I climbed the Pinnacle Ridge. I had
prospected it from above, and had come to the conclusion that,
while the left fork <i>might</i> be climbed, the right was
impossible or nearly so, for, modestly as it began, it ran out
into a fearsome crack on the face of the cliff, and did not
become a chimney again till after a hundred feet of unclimbable
rotten granite.</p>

<p>So I tried the left fork, which looked horribly unpromising.
The first trouble was a chockstone, which I managed to climb
round, and then the confounded thing widened and became
perpendicular. I remembered that I had believed a way could be
found by taking to the right-hand face, and in the excitement of
the climb I forgot all precautions. It simply did not occur to me
that this face route might bring me in sight of eyes which at all
costs I must avoid.</p>

<p>It was not an easy business, for there was an extreme poverty
of decent holds. But I have done worse pitches in my time, and
had I not had a rifle to carry (I had no sling), might have
thought less of it. Very soon I was past the worst, and saw my
way to returning to the chimney, which had once more become
reasonable. I stopped for a second to prospect the route, with my
foot on a sound ledge, my right elbow crooked round a jag of
rock, and my left hand, which held the rifle, stretched out so
that my fingers could test the soundness of a certain
handhold.</p>

<p>Suddenly I felt the power go out of those fingers. The stone
seemed to crumble and splinters flew into my eye. There was a
crashing of echoes, which drowned the noise of my rifle as it
clattered down the precipice. I remember looking at my hand
spread-eagled against the rock, and wondering why it looked so
strange.</p>

<p>The light was just beginning to fail, so it must have been
about half-past seven.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>IV</h2>

<h2>7.30 P.M. AND ONWARDS</h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Had anything of the sort happened to me during an ordinary
climb I should beyond doubt have lost my footing with the shock
and fallen. But, being pursued, I suppose my nerves were keyed to
a perpetual expectancy, and I did not slip. The fear of a second
bullet saved my life. In a trice I was back in the chimney, and
the second bullet spent itself harmlessly on the granite.</p>

<p>Mercifully it was now easier going--honest knee-and-back work,
which I could manage in spite of my shattered fingers. I climbed
feverishly with a cold sweat on my brow, but every muscle was in
order, and I knew I would make no mistake. The chimney was deep,
and a ledge of rock hid me from my enemy below. . . . Presently I
squeezed through a gap, swung myself up with my right hand and my
knees to a shelf, and saw that the difficulties were over. A
shallow gully, filled with screes, led up to the crest of the
ridge. It was the place I had looked down on three weeks
before.</p>

<p>I examined my left hand, which was in a horrid mess. The top
of my thumb was blown off, and the two top joints of my middle
and third fingers were smashed to pulp. I felt no pain in them,
though they were dripping blood, but I had a queer numbness in my
left shoulder. I managed to bind the hand up in a handkerchief,
where it made a gory bundle. Then I tried to collect my wits.</p>

<p>Medina was coming up the chimney after me. He knew I had no
rifle. He was, as I had heard, an expert cragsman, and he was the
younger man by at least ten years. My first thought was to make
for the upper part of the Pinnacle Ridge, and try to hide or to
elude him somehow till the darkness. But he could follow me in
the transparent Northern night, and I must soon weaken from loss
of blood. I could not hope to put sufficient distance between us
for safety, and he had his deadly rifle. Somewhere in the night
or in the dawning he would get me. No, I must stay and fight it
out.</p>

<p>Could I hold the chimney? I had no weapon but stones, but I
might be able to prevent a man ascending by those intricate
rocks. In the chimney at any rate there was cover, and he could
not use his rifle. . . . But would he try the chimney? Why should
he not go round by the lower slopes of the Pinnacle Ridge and
come on me from above?</p>

<p>It was the dread of his bullets that decided me. My one
passionate longing was for cover. I might get him in a place
where his rifle was useless and I had a chance to use my greater
muscular strength. I did not care what happened to me provided I
got my hands on him. Behind all my fear and confusion and pain
there was now a cold fury of rage.</p>

<p>So I slipped back into the chimney and descended it to where
it turned slightly to the left past a nose of rock. Here I had
cover, and could peer down into the darkening deeps of the great
couloir.</p>

<p>A purple haze filled the corrie, and the Machray tops were
like dull amethysts. The sky was a cloudy blue sprinkled with
stars, and mingled with the last flush of sunset was the first
tide of the afterglow. . . . At first all was quiet in the gully.
I heard the faint trickle of stones which are always falling in
such a place, and once the croak of a hungry raven. . . . Was my
enemy there? Did he know of the easier route up the Pinnacle
Ridge? Would he not assume that if I could climb the cleft he
could follow, and would he feel any dread of a man with no gun
and a shattered hand?</p>

<p>Then from far below came a sound I recognised--iron hobnails
on rock. I began to collect loose stones and made a little pile
of such ammunition beside me. . . . I realised that Medina had
begun the ascent of the lower pitches. Every breach in the
stillness was perfectly clear--the steady scraping in the
chimney, the fall of a fragment of rock as he surmounted the
lower chockstone, the scraping again as he was forced out on to
the containing wall. The light must have been poor, but the road
was plain. Of course I saw nothing of him, for a bulge prevented
me, but my ears told me the story. Then there was silence. I
realised that he had come to the place where the chimney
forked.</p>

<p>I had my stones ready, for I hoped to get him when he was
driven out on the face at the overhang, the spot where I had been
when he fired.</p>

<p>The sounds began again, and I waited in a desperate choking
calm. In a minute or two would come the crisis. I remember that
the afterglow was on the Machray tops and made a pale light in
the corrie below. In the cleft there was still a kind of dim
twilight. Any moment I expected to see a dark thing in movement
fifty feet below, which would be Medina's head.</p>

<p>But it did not come. The noise of scraped rock still
continued, but it seemed to draw no nearer. Then I realised that
I had misjudged the situation. Medina had taken the right-hand
fork. He was bound to, unless he had made, like me, an earlier
reconnaissance. My route in the half-light must have looked
starkly impossible.</p>

<p>The odds were now on my side. No man in the fast-gathering
darkness could hope to climb the cliff face and rejoin that
chimney after its interruption. He would go on till he stuck--and
then it would not be too easy to get back. I reascended my own
cleft, for I had a notion that I might traverse across the space
between the two forks, and find a vantage point for a view.</p>

<p>Very slowly and painfully, for my left arm was beginning to
burn like fire and my left shoulder and neck to feel strangely
paralysed, I wriggled across the steep face till I found a sort
of <i>gendarme</i> of rock, beyond which the cliff fell smoothly
to the lip of the other fork. The great gully below was now a pit
of darkness, but the afterglow still lingered on this upper
section and I saw clearly where Medina's chimney lay, where it
narrowed and where it ran out. I fixed myself so as to prevent
myself falling, for I feared I was becoming light-headed. Then I
remembered Angus's rope, got it unrolled, took a coil round my
waist, and made a hitch over the <i>gendarme.</i></p>

<p>There was a smothered cry from below, and suddenly came the
ring of metal on stone, and then a clatter of something falling.
I knew what it meant. Medina's rifle had gone the way of mine and
lay now among the boulders at the chimney foot. At last we stood
on equal terms, and, befogged as my mind was, I saw that nothing
now could stand between us and a settlement.</p>

<p>It seemed to me that I saw something moving in the half-light.
If it was Medina, he had left the chimney and was trying the
face. That way I knew there was no hope. He would be forced back,
and surely would soon realise the folly of it and descend. Now
that his rifle had gone my hatred had ebbed. I seemed only to be
watching a fellow-mountaineer in a quandary.</p>

<p>He could not have been forty feet from me, for I heard his
quick breathing. He was striving hard for holds, and the rock
must have been rotten, for there was a continuous dropping of
fragments, and once a considerable boulder hurtled down the
couloir.</p>

<p>"Go back, man," I cried instinctively. "Back to the chimney.
You can't get further that way."</p>

<p>I suppose he heard me, for he made a more violent effort, and
I thought I could see him sprawl at a foothold which he missed,
and then swing out on his hands. He was evidently weakening, for
I heard a sob of weariness. If he could not regain the chimney,
there was three hundred feet of a fall to the boulders at the
foot.</p>

<p>"Medina," I yelled, "I've a rope. I'm going to send it down to
you. Get your arm in the loop."</p>

<p>I made a noose at the end with my teeth and my right hand,
working with a maniac's fury.</p>

<p>"I'll fling it straight out," I cried. "Catch it when it falls
to you."</p>

<p>My cast was good enough, but he let it pass, and the rope
dangled down into the abyss.</p>

<p>"Oh, damn it, man," I roared, "you can trust me. We'll have it
out when I get you safe. You'll break your neck if you hang
there."</p>

<p>Again I threw, and suddenly the rope tightened. He believed my
word, and I think that was the greatest compliment ever paid me
in all my days.</p>

<p>"Now you're held," I cried. "I've got a belay here. Try and
climb back into the chimney."</p>

<p>He understood and began to move. But his arms and legs must
have been numb with fatigue, for suddenly that happened which I
feared. There was a wild slipping and plunging, and then he swung
out limply, missing the chimney, right on to the smooth wall of
the cliff.</p>

<p>There was nothing for it but to haul him back. I knew Angus's
ropes too well to have any confidence in them, and I had only the
one good hand. The rope ran through a groove of stone which I had
covered with my coat, and I hoped to work it even with a single
arm by moving slowly upwards.</p>

<p>"I'll pull you up," I yelled, "but for God's sake give me some
help. Don't hang on the rope more than you need."</p>

<p>My loop was a large one and I think he had got both arms
through it. He was a monstrous weight, limp and dead as a sack,
for though I could feel him scraping and kicking at the cliff
face, the rock was too smooth for fissures. I held the rope with
my feet planted against boulders, and wrought till my muscles
cracked. Inch by inch I was drawing him in, till I realised the
danger.</p>

<p>The rope was grating on the sharp brink beyond the chimney and
might at any moment be cut by a knife-edge.</p>

<p>"Medina"--my voice must have been like a wild animal's
scream--"this is too dangerous. I'm going to let you down a bit
so that you can traverse. There's a sort of ledge down there. For
Heaven's sake go canny with this rope."</p>

<p>I slipped the belay from the <i>gendarme,</i> and hideously
difficult it was. Then I moved farther down to a little platform
nearer the chimney. This gave me about six extra yards.</p>

<p>"Now," I cried, when I had let him slip down, "a little to
your left. Do you feel the ledge?"</p>

<p>He had found some sort of foothold, and for a moment there was
a relaxation of the strain. The rope swayed to my right towards
the chimney. I began to see a glimmer of hope.</p>

<p>"Cheer up," I cried. "Once in the chimney you're safe. Sing
out when you reach it."</p>

<p>The answer out of the darkness was a sob. I think giddiness
must have overtaken him, or that atrophy of muscle which is the
peril of rock-climbing. Suddenly the rope scorched my fingers and
a shock came on my middle which dragged me to the very edge of
the abyss.</p>

<p>I still believe that I could have saved him if I had had the
use of both my hands, for I could have guided the rope away from
that fatal knife-edge. I knew it was hopeless, but I put every
ounce of strength and will into the effort to swing it with its
burden into the chimney. He gave me no help, for I think--I
hope--that he was unconscious. Next second the strands had
parted, and I fell back with a sound in my ears which I pray God
I may never hear again--the sound of a body rebounding dully from
crag to crag, and then a long soft rumbling of screes like a
snowslip.</p>

<p align="CENTER">*****</p>

<p>I managed to crawl the few yards to the anchorage of the
<i>gendarme</i> before my senses departed. There in the morning
Mary and Angus found me.</p>
