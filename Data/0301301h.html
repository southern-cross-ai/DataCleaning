  <h3><a name="chap1"
     id="chap1">CHAPTER 1</a></h2>

  <p>This story was told me by Leithen, as we were returning rather late in the
  season from a shooting holiday in North Ontario. There were few passengers,
  the weather was a succession of snow blizzards and gales, and as we had the
  smoking-room for the most part to ourselves, we stoked up the fire and fell
  into a mood of yarns and reminiscences. Leithen, being a lawyer, has a liking
  for careful detail, and his tale took long in the telling; indeed, snatches
  of it filled the whole of that rough October passage. The version I have
  written out is amplified from his narrative, but I think it is accurate, for
  he took the trouble to revise it.</p>

  <p>Romance (he said) is a word I am shy of using. It has been so staled and
  pawed by fools that the bloom is gone from it, and to most people it stands
  for a sugary world as flat as an eighteenth-century Arcadia. But, dry stick
  as I am, I hanker after my own notion of romance. I suppose it is the lawyer
  in me, but I define it as something in life which happens with an exquisite
  aptness and a splendid finality, as if Fate had suddenly turned
  artist&mdash;something which catches the breath because it is so wholly
  right. Also for me it must happen to youth. I do not complain of growing old,
  but I like to keep my faith that at one stage in our mortal existence nothing
  is impossible. It is part of my belief that the universe is on the whole
  friendly to man, and that the ordering of the world is in the main benevolent
 ...  So I go about expecting things, waiting like an old pagan for the descent
  of the goddess. And once&mdash;only once&mdash;I caught the authentic shimmer
  of her wings.</p><br>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p>My story begins in January 1913, when I took my nephew Charles to dine
  with the Amysforts for a ball they were giving. Balls are not much in my
  line, for when I came first to London it was the foolish fashion of young men
  not to dance, but to lounge superciliously in doorways, while their elders
  took the floor. I had a good deal of work on hand, and I meant to leave
  immediately after dinner, but the necessity of launching Charles made me
  linger through the first few dances. My nephew was a cheerful young gentleman
  in his second year at Oxford, and it presently appeared that he did not want
  for friends of his own age. There was a perpetual bandying of nicknames and
  occult chaff with other fresh-coloured boys.</p>

  <p>One in particular caught my attention. He was a tall young man of about
  Charles's age, who was not dancing but stood beside one of the windows with
  his head silhouetted against a dark curtain. He was uncommonly handsome after
  the ordinary English pattern, but our youth is mostly good to behold, and
  that would not have fixed my attention. What struck me was his pose. He was
  looking at the pretty spectacle with a curious aloofness&mdash;with eyes that
  received much but gave out nothing. I have never seen any one so completely
  detached, so clothed with his own atmosphere, and since that is rare at the
  age of twenty, I asked Charles if he knew him.</p>

  <p>"Rather. It's old Milburne. He's up at Magdalen with me. First string for
  the 'Varsity mile. Believed"&mdash;his voice became reverential&mdash;"to be
  going to knock five seconds off his last year's time. Most awful good chap.
  Like me to introduce you?"</p>

  <p>The young man in response to my nephew's beckoning approached us. "Hullo,
  Vernon, how's life?" said my nephew. "Want to introduce you to my
  uncle&mdash;Sir Edward Leithen&mdash;big legal swell, you know&mdash;good
  fellow to have behind you if you run up against the laws of England."</p>

  <p>Charles left us to claim a partner, and I exchanged a few commonplaces
  with his friend, for I too&mdash;<i>consule Planco</i> [in the good old
  days]&mdash;had run the mile. Our short talk was the merest platitudes, but
  my feeling about his odd distinction was intensified. There was something
  old-fashioned in his manner&mdash;wholly self-possessed yet with no touch of
  priggishness&mdash;a little formal, as if he had schooled himself to be
  urbanely and delicately on his guard. My guess at the time was that he had
  foreign blood in him, not from any difference of colouring or feature, but
  from his silken reserve. We of the North are apt to be angular in our
  silences; we have not learned the art of gracious reticence.</p>

  <p>That boy's face remained clearly fixed in my memory. It is a thing that
  often happens to me, for without any reason on earth I will carry about with
  me pictures of some casual witnesses or clients whom I am bound to recognize
  if I ever see them again. It is as freakish a gift as that which makes some
  men remember scraps of doggerel. I saw the face so vividly in my mind that,
  if I had been an artist, I could have drawn it accurately down to the finest
  lines of the mouth and the wary courtesy of the eyes. I do not suppose I gave
  the meeting another conscious thought, for I was desperately busy at the
  time, but I knew that I had added another portrait to the lumber-room of my
  absurd memory.</p>

  <p>I had meant to go to Scotland that Easter vacation to fish, but a sudden
  pressure of Crown cases upset all my plans, and I had to limit my holiday to
  four days. I wanted exercise, so I took it in the most violent form, and went
  for a walk in the Westmorland hills. The snow lay late that year, and I got
  the exercise I sought scrambling up icy gullies and breasting north-easters
  on the long bleak ridges. All went well till the last day, which I spent
  among the Cartmel fells intending to catch a train at an obscure station
  which would enable me to join the night mail for London at Lancaster. You
  know how those little hills break down in stony shelves to the sea. Well, as
  luck would have it, I stepped into a hole between two boulders masked with
  snow, and crawled out with the unpleasing certainty that I had either broken
  or badly wrenched my ankle. By the time I had hobbled down to the beginning
  of the stonewalled pastures I knew that it was a twist and not a break, but
  before I reached a road I knew also that I would never reach the station in
  time for my train.</p>

  <p>It had begun to snow again, the spring dusk was falling, and the place was
  very lonely. My watch told me that even if I found a farm or inn and hired a
  trap I should miss my train. The only chance was to get a motor-car to take
  me to Lancaster. But there was no sign of farm or inn&mdash;only interminable
  dusky snowy fields, and the road was too small and obscure to make a friendly
  motor-car probable. I limped along in a very bad temper. It was not a matter
  of desperate urgency that I should be in London next morning, though delay
  would mean the postponement of a piece of business I wanted to get finished.
  But the prospect was black for my immediate comfort. The best I could look
  forward to was a bed in a farm- or a wayside public-house, and a slow and
  painful journey next day. I was angry with myself for my clumsiness. I had
  thought my ankles beyond reproach, and it was ridiculous that after three
  days on rough and dangerous mountains I should come to grief on a paltry
  hillock.</p>

  <p>The dusk thickened, and not a soul did I meet. Presently woods began to
  creep around the road, and I walked between two patches of blackness in a
  thin glimmer of twilight which would soon be gone. I was cold and hungry and
  rather tired, and my ankle gave me a good deal of pain. I tried to think
  where I was, and could only remember that the station, which had been my
  immediate objective, was still at least six miles distant. I had out my map
  and wasted half a dozen matches on it, but it was a map of the hill country
  and stopped short of my present whereabouts. Very soon I had come to a
  determination to stop at the first human habitation, were it a labourer's
  cottage, and throw myself upon the compassion of its inmates. But not a
  flicker of light could I see to mark the presence of man.</p>

  <p>Then something white glimmered faintly on my left, and I saw that it was a
  wicket gate. This must mean a house near at hand, so I hopefully pushed it
  open and entered. I found myself in a narrow path running among fir trees. It
  was nearly pitch-dark in that place, and I was in fear of losing the road,
  which was obscured by the fallen snow, and getting lost in a wood. Soon,
  however, I was clear of the firs and in more open country among what looked
  like beeches. The wind, too, had swept the path bare, and there was just
  enough light to make it out as it twined up and down a little glade. I
  suspected that I was in a demesne of some considerable house, and the
  suspicion became a certainty when my track emerged on a broad gravel drive.
  After that my way was clear. The drive took me into a park&mdash;I knew it
  was a park because of the frequent swing-gates for cattle&mdash;and suddenly
  it bore to the right and I saw half a dozen irregularly placed lights high up
  in the air before me. This was the house, and it must be a large one, for
  some of the lights were far apart.</p>

  <p>Five minutes later I found myself ringing the bell in a massive pillared
  porch, and explaining my case to a very old butler, to whom I gave my
  card.</p>

  <p>"I've had an accident on the hills," I said, "and twisted my ankle rather
  badly. I wonder if I might ask for some assistance&mdash;to get to an inn or
  a station. I'm afraid I don't in the least know where I am."</p>

  <p>"This is Severns Hall, sir," said the man. "My master is Mr. Vernon
  Milburne. If you will come in, sir, I will acquaint him with the
  position."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Vernon Milburne?" I cried. "I believe I have met him. I think he is
  at Oxford with my nephew."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Milburne is a member of the University of Oxford," said the ancient
  man. He led me into a vast hall of the worst kind of Victorian Gothic, in
  which a big bright wood fire crackled. When he saw me clearly the butler
  proved a very angel of mercy. "I think, sir, you should first have a little
  refreshment," he said, and brought me a whisky-and-soda. Then, while I thawed
  my frozen bones before the logs, he departed to seek his master.</p>

  <p>I was too preoccupied with my own grievances to feel much interest in the
  fact that I had stumbled upon the dwelling of the boy who had so intrigued me
  at Lady Amysfort's ball. But as I warmed my hands at the blaze it did occur
  to me that this was the last kind of house I would have linked him
  with&mdash;this sham-mediaeval upholstered magnificence. It was Gothic with
  every merit of Gothic left out, and an air of dull ecclesiasticism hung about
  it. There was even an organ at one end, ugly and staring, as if it had come
  out of some <i>nouveau riche</i> provincial church. Every bit of woodwork was
  fretted and tortured into fancy shapes.</p>

  <p>I heard a voice at my elbow.</p>

  <p>"I think we have met before, Sir Edward," it said. "I am so sorry for your
  misfortune. Let's get the boot off and look at the ankle."</p>

  <p>"It's only a sprain," I said. "I really don't want to bother you. If you
  would be so very kind as to lend me a car to take me to Lancaster, I can
  manage to travel all right. I ought to be in London to-morrow morning."</p>

  <p>"Nonsense!" He smiled in a pleasant boyish way. "You are going to stay
  here to-night, and if you're well enough I'll send you into Lancaster
  to-morrow. You look simply fagged out. Let's get the boot off and see if we
  need a doctor."</p>

  <p>He summoned the butler, and the two of them soon had my foot bare, while
  the boy, who seemed to know something about sprains, ran a light hand over
  the ankle bone.</p>

  <p>"Nothing very bad here," he said; "but it must have been jolly painful to
  walk with. We'll bandage it and you need only limp for a day or two. Beaton,
  find out if Sir Edward's room is ready. You'd better have a hot bath and then
  we'll do the bandaging. After that you'll want some food. I'll lend you a
  dressing-gown and dry clothes."</p>

  <p>The next hour was spent in restoring me to some ease of body. Severns
  might be an ugly house, but whoever built it had a pretty notion of comfort
  in bedrooms. I had two rooms, each with a cheerful fire, and when I had had
  my bath the two Samaritans bandaged my ankle as neatly as a hospital nurse,
  and helped me into a suit of flannels. Then Vernon disappeared, and when he
  returned he was dressed for dinner. A table had been laid for me in the
  sitting-room, and Beaton was waiting to ask me what I would drink.</p>

  <p>"Champagne," said Vernon. "I prescribe it."</p>

  <p>"But you're making far too much fuss about me," I protested. "I can easily
  dine downstairs with you."</p>

  <p>"I think you ought to dine here. You've put yourself in my hands and I'm
  your medical adviser."</p>

  <p>He saw me start my meal before he left me.</p>

  <p>"Do you mind if I say good-night now?" he said. "You ought to get to bed
  pretty soon, and I have some work I want to do after dinner. Sound sleep and
  pleasant dreams."</p>

  <p>I dined excellently, and after a single pipe was resolutely put to bed by
  Beaton the butler. They were benevolent despots in this house who were not to
  be gainsaid. I was sufficiently weary to be glad to go to sleep, but before I
  dropped off I wondered just a little at the nature of my reception. There
  were no other guests, Beaton had told me, and it seemed odd that a boy of
  nineteen alone in this Gothic mausoleum should show so little desire for
  human companionship. I should have expected, even if I were not allowed
  downstairs, to have had him come and talk to me for an hour or so before
  turning in. What work had he to which he was so faithful? I remembered that
  Charles had mentioned that he was a bit of a swell at his books, but, as
  Charles himself had been ploughed for Pass Mods, that might mean very little.
  Anyhow, there was something morbid about a conscience which at nineteen
  forced its possessor to work in vacation time after dinner. He had been
  immensely hospitable, but obviously he had not wanted my company. That
  aloofness which I had remarked at Lady Amysfort's ball had become a heavy
  preoccupation. His attitude had been courteously defensive; there had been a
  screen which robbed his kindness of all geniality. I felt quite distinctly
  that there was something in or about the house, something connected with
  himself, from which I was being resolutely excluded.</p>

  <p>I slept well, and was awakened by Beaton bringing my early tea. He had
  undrawn the curtains and opened one of the windows, and a great flood of
  sunlight and spring airs was pouring through. The storm had passed, and April
  was in her most generous mood. My ankle felt lumpish and stiff, but when
  Beaton examined it he pronounced that it was mending nicely. "But you can't
  press on it to-day, sir," he added. "Mr. Vernon won't let you move to-day...
  Breakfast will be laid in the sitting-room, and Mr. Vernon's compliments and
  he proposes to join you at nine o'clock. I will return and bandage the ankle
  and assist you to rise as soon as Prayers are over."</p>

  <p>Presently, as I lay watching a ridge of distant hill seen through the
  window and trying to decide what it could be, the sound of singing rose from
  some room below me. It must be Prayers. The old-fashioned hymn tune reminded
  me of my childhood, and I wondered how many young men of to-day kept up the
  fashion of family worship when alone in a country house. And then I suddenly
  remembered all about the Milburnes, for they had been my mother's
  friends.</p>

  <p>Humphrey Milburne had been a rich Lancashire cotton-spinner, whose father
  or grandfather&mdash;I forget which&mdash;had been one of the pioneers of the
  industry. I don't think he had ever concerned himself greatly with business,
  for his <i>m&eacute;tier</i> had always been that of the devout layman who is
  more occupied with church affairs than any bishop. He had been a leader of
  the Evangelical party, a vigorous opponent of ritualist practices, and a
  noted organizer of religious revivals. Vague memories of him came back to me
  from my childhood, for my own family had been of the same persuasion. I had a
  recollection of a tall, bearded man who, on a visit to us, had insisted on
  seeing the children, and had set me on his knee, and had asked me, a
  shivering, self-conscious mite, embarrassing questions about my soul. I
  remembered his wife, Lady Augusta, more clearly. She was a thin little woman
  who never seemed to be separated from a large squashy Bible stuffed with
  leaflets and secured by many elastic bands. She had had a knack of dropping
  everything as she moved, and I had acted as page to retrieve her belongings.
  She had been very kind to me, for to her grief she had then no children...  I
  remembered that a son had at last been born&mdash;"a child of many prayers,"
  my mother had called him. And then came a vague recollection of a tragedy.
  Lady Augusta had died when the boy was an infant, and her husband had
  followed within the year. After that the Milburnes passed out of my life,
  except that their nurse had come to us when I was at Oxford, and had had much
  to say of young Master Vernon.</p>

  <p>My vague remembrance seemed to explain my host. The child of ageing
  parents and an orphan from his early years&mdash;that would account for his
  lack of youthful spontaneity. I liked the notion of him I was acquiring;
  there was something quaint and loyal in his keeping up the family
  ritual&mdash;an evangelical athlete with the looks of Apollo. I had fancied
  something foreign in his air, but that of course was nonsense. He came of the
  most prosaic British stock, cotton-spinning Milburnes, and for his mother a
  Douglas-Ernott, whose family was the quintessence of Whig solidity.</p>

  <p>I found Vernon waiting for me in the sunny sitting-room, dressed in rough
  grey homespun, and with an air of being ready for a long day in the open.
  There was a change in him since the night before. His eyes were a little
  heavy, as if he had slept badly, but the shutters were lifted from them. His
  manner was no longer constrained, and the slight awkwardness I had felt in
  his presence was gone. He was now a cheerful communicative undergraduate.</p>

  <p>"Beaton says you had a good night, sir, but you mustn't use that foot of
  yours. You can't think of London to-day, you know. I've nothing to do except
  look after you, so you'd better think of me as Charles with a nephew's
  privileges. It's going to be a clinking fine day, so what do you say to
  running up in the car to the moors above Shap and listening to the curlews?
  In the spring they're the joiliest things alive."</p>

  <p>He was a schoolboy now, looking forward to an outing, and we might have
  been breakfasting in Oxford rooms before going out with the Bicester. I fell
  into his holiday mood, and forgot to tell him that I had long ago met his
  parents. He lent me an ulster and helped me downstairs, where he packed me
  into the front of a big Daimler and got in beside me. In the clear spring
  sunshine, with the park a chessboard of green grass and melting snow, and the
  rooks cawing in the beech tops, Severns looked almost venerable, for its
  lines were good and the stone was weathering well. He nodded towards the long
  fa&ccedil;ades. "Ugly old thing, when you think of Levens or Sizergh, but it
  was my grandfather's taste, and I mean to respect it. If we get a fine sunset
  you'll see it light up like an enchanted castle. It's something to be able to
  see the hills from every window, and to get a glimpse of the sea from the top
  floor. Goodish sport, too, for we've several miles of salmon and sea trout,
  and we get uncommon high birds in the upper coverts."</p>

  <p>We sped up by winding hill-roads to the moors, and there were the curlews
  crying over the snow-patched bent with that note which is at once eerie, and
  wistful, and joyful. There were grouse, too, busy about their nesting, and an
  occasional stone-chat, and dippers flashing their white waistcoats in every
  beck. It was like being on the roof of the world, with the high Lake hills a
  little foreshortened, like ships coming over the horizon at sea. Lunch we had
  with us, and ate on a dry bank of heather, and we had tea in a whitewashed
  moorland farm. I have never taken to any one so fast as I took to that boy.
  He was in the highest spirits, as if he had finished some difficult task, and
  in the rebound he became extraordinarily companionable. I think he took to me
  also, for he showed a shy but intense interest in my doings, the eagerness
  with which an undergraduate prospects the channels of the world's life which
  he is soon to navigate. I had been prepared to find a touch of innocent
  priggishness, but there was nothing of the kind. He seemed to have no dogmas
  of his own, only inquiries.</p>

  <p>"I suppose a lawyer's training fits a man to examine all kinds of
  problems&mdash;not only legal ones," he asked casually at luncheon. "I mean
  he understands the value of any sort of evidence, for the principles of
  logical truth are always the same?"</p>

  <p>"I suppose so," I replied, "though it's only legal conundrums that come my
  way. I was once asked my opinion on a scientific proof&mdash;in the higher
  mathematics&mdash;but I didn't make much of it&mdash;couldn't quite catch on
  to the data or understand the language."</p>

  <p>"Yes, that might be a difficulty," he admitted. "But a thing like a ghost
  story, for instance&mdash;you'd be all right at that, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>The boy had clearly something in his head, and I wondered if the raw
  magnificence of Severns harboured any spooks. Could that be the reason of his
  diffidence on the previous evening?</p>

  <p>When we got home we sat smoking by the library fire, and while I skimmed
  the <i>Times</i> Vernon dozed. He must have been short of his sleep and was
  now making up for it in the way of a healthy young man. As I watched his even
  breathing I decided that here there could be no abnormality of body or mind.
  It was like watching a tired spaniel on the rug, too tired even to hunt in
  his dreams.</p>

  <p>As I lifted my eyes from the paper I saw that he was awake and was looking
  at me intently, as if he were hesitating about asking me some question.</p>

  <p>"I've been asleep," he apologized. "I can drop off anywhere after a day on
  the hills."</p>

  <p>"You were rather sleepless as a child, weren't you?" I asked.</p>

  <p>His eyes opened. "I wonder how you know that?"</p>

  <p>"From your old nurse. I ought to have told you that in my boyhood I knew
  your parents a little. They stayed with us more than once. And Mrs. Ganthony
  came to my mother from you. I was at Oxford at the time, and I remember how
  she used to entertain us with stories about Severns. You must have been an
  infant when she left."</p>

  <p>"I was four. What sort of things did she tell you?"</p>

  <p>"About your bad nights, and your pluck. I fancy it was by way of censure
  of our declamatory habits. Why, after all these years I remember some of her
  phrases. How did the thing go? 'What fidgeted me was the way his lordship
  'eld his tongue. For usual he'd shout as lusty as a whelp, but on these
  mornings I'd find him with his eyes like moons and his skin white and shiny,
  and never a cheep the whole blessed night, with me lying next door, and a
  light sleeper at all times, Mrs. Wace, ma'am.' Was Mrs. Wace a sort of Mrs.
  Harris?"</p>

  <p>He laughed merrily. "To think that you should have heard that! No, she was
  our housekeeper, and Ganthony, who babbled like Sairey Gamp, made a litany of
  her name. That's the most extraordinary thing I ever heard."</p>

  <p>"You've outgrown that childish ailment anyhow," I said.</p>

  <p>"Yes. I have outgrown it." My practice with witnesses made me detect just
  a shade of hesitation.</p>

  <p>At dinner he returned to the subject which seemed to interest him, the
  exact nature of the legal training. I told him that I was an advocate, not a
  judge, and so had no need to cultivate a judicial mind.</p>

  <p>"But you can't do without it," he protested. "You have to advise your
  client and pronounce on his case before you argue it. The bulk of your work
  must be the weighing of evidence. I should have thought that that talent
  could be applied to any subject in the world if the facts were sufficiently
  explained. In the long run the most abstruse business will boil down to a
  fairly simple deduction from certain data. Your profession enables you to
  select the relevant data."</p>

  <p>"That may be true in theory, but I wouldn't myself rate legal talent so
  high. A lawyer is apt to lack imagination, you know." Then I stopped, for I
  had suddenly the impression that Vernon wanted advice, help of some
  kind&mdash;that behind all his ease he was profoundly anxious, and that a
  plea, almost a cry, was trembling on his lips. I detest confidences and
  labour to avoid them, but I could no more refuse this boy than stop my ears
  against a sick child. So I added, "Of course lawyers make good confidants.
  They're mostly decent fellows, and they're accustomed to keeping their mouths
  shut."</p>

  <p>He nodded, as if I had settled some private scruple, and we fell to
  talking about spring salmon in the Tay.</p>

  <p>"Take the port into the library," he told Beaton. "Sir Edward doesn't want
  coffee. Oh, and see that the fire is good. We shan't need you again to-night.
  I'll put Sir Edward to bed."</p>

  <p>There was an odd air of purpose about him, as he gave me his arm to the
  library and settled me with a cigar in a long chair. Then he disappeared for
  a minute or two and returned with a shabby little clasped leather book. He
  locked the door and put the key on the mantelpiece, and when he caught me
  smiling he smiled too, a little nervously.</p>

  <p>"Please don't think me an ass," he said. "I'm going to ask a tremendous
  favour. I want you to listen to me while I tell you a story, something I have
  never told to any one in my life before...  I don't think you'll laugh at me,
  and I've a notion you may be able to help me. It's a confounded liberty, I
  know, but may I go on?"</p>

  <p>"Most certainly," I said. "I can't imagine myself laughing at anything you
  had to tell me; and if there's anything in me that can help you it's yours
  for the asking."</p>

  <p>He drew a long breath. "You spoke of my bad nights as a child and I said I
  had outgrown them. Well, it isn't true."</p><br>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p>When Vernon was a very little boy he was the sleepiest and healthiest of
  mortals, but every spring he had a spell of bad dreams. He slept at that time
  in the big new night-nursery at the top of the west wing, which his parents
  had built not long before their death. It had three windows looking out to
  the moorish flats which run up to the fells, and from one window, by craning
  your neck, you could catch a glimpse of the sea. It was all hung, too, with a
  Chinese paper whereon pink and green parrots squatted in wonderful blue
  trees, and there seemed generally to be a wood fire burning. He described the
  place in detail, not as it is to-day, but as he remembered it.</p>

  <p>Vernon's recollection of his childish nightmares was hazy. They varied, I
  gathered, but narrowed down in the end to one type. He used to find himself
  in a room different from the nursery and bigger, but with the same smell of
  wood smoke. People came and went, such as his nurse, the butler, Simon the
  head keeper, Uncle Appleby his guardian, Cousin Jennifer, the old woman who
  sold oranges in Axby, and a host of others. Nobody hindered them from going
  away, and they seemed to be pleading with him to come too. There was danger
  in the place; something was going to happen in the big room, and if by that
  time he was not gone there would be mischief...  But it was quite clear to
  him that he could not go. He must stop there, with the wood smoke in his
  nostrils, and await the advent of the something. But he was never quite sure
  of the nature of the compulsion. He had a notion that if he made a rush for
  the door at Uncle Appleby's heels he would be allowed to escape, but that
  somehow he would be behaving badly. Anyhow, the place put him into a sweat of
  fright, and Mrs. Ganthony looked darkly at him in the morning.</p>

  <p>Those troubled springs continued&mdash;odd interludes in a life of nearly
  unbroken health. Mrs. Ganthony left because she could not control her tongue
  and increased the boy's terrors, and Vernon was nine&mdash;he
  thought&mdash;before the dream began to take a really definite shape. The
  stage was emptying. There was nobody in the room now but himself, and he saw
  its details a little more clearly. It was not any apartment in Severns.
  Rather it seemed like one of the big old panelled chambers which he
  remembered from visits to the Midland country houses of his mother's family,
  when he had arrived after dark and had been put to sleep in a great bed in a
  place lit with dancing firelight. In the morning it had looked only an
  ordinary big room, but at that hour of the evening it had seemed an enchanted
  cave. The dream-room was not unlike these, for there was the scent of a wood
  fire and there were dancing shadows, but he could not see clearly the walls
  or the ceiling, and there was no bed. In one corner was a door which led to
  the outer world, and through this he knew that he might on no account pass.
  Another door faced him, and he knew that he had only to turn the handle for
  it to open.</p>

  <p>But he did not want to, for he understood quite clearly what was beyond.
  There was a second room just like the first one; he knew nothing about it
  except that opposite the entrance another door led out of it. Beyond was a
  third chamber, and so on interminably. There seemed to the boy to be no end
  to this fantastic suite. He thought of it as a great snake of masonry,
  winding up hill and down dale away to the fells or the sea...  Yes, but there
  <i>was</i> an end. Somewhere far away in one of the rooms was a terror
  waiting on him, or, as he feared, coming towards him. Even now it might be
  flitting from room to room, every minute bringing its soft tread nearer to
  the chamber of the wood fire.</p>

  <p>About this time of his life the dream was an unmitigated horror. Once it
  came while he was ill with a childish fever, and it sent his temperature up
  to a point which brought Dr. Moreton galloping from Axby. In his waking hours
  he did not, as a rule, remember it clearly; but during the fever, asleep and
  awake, that sinuous building, one room thick, with each room opening from the
  other, was never away from his thoughts. It amazed him to think that outside
  were the cheerful moors where he hunted for plovers' eggs, and that only a
  thin wall of stone kept him from pleasant homely things. The thought used to
  comfort him when he was awake, but in the dream it never came near him.
  Asleep, the whole world seemed one suite of rooms, and he, a forlorn little
  prisoner, doomed grimly to wait on the slow coming through the many doors of
  a fear which transcended word and thought.</p>

  <p>He became a silent, self-absorbed boy, and, though the fact of his
  nightmares was patent to the little household, the details remained locked up
  in his head. Not even to Uncle Appleby would he tell them, when that
  gentleman, hurriedly kind, came to visit his convalescent ward. His illness
  made Vernon grow, and he shot up into a lanky, leggy boy. But the hills soon
  tautened his sinews, and all the time at his preparatory school he was a
  healthy and active child. He told me that he tried to exorcise the dream
  through his religion&mdash;to "lay his burden on the Lord," as the old
  evangelical phrase has it; but he signally failed, though he got some comfort
  from the attempt. It was borne in on him, he said, that this was a burden
  which the Lord had laid quite definitely on him and meant him to bear like a
  man.</p>

  <p>He was fifteen and at Eton when he made the great discovery. The dream had
  become almost a custom now. It came in April at Severns about
  Easter-tide&mdash;a night's discomfort (it was now scarcely more) in the rush
  and glory of the holidays. There was a moment of the old wild
  heart-fluttering; but a boy's fancy is more quickly dulled than a child's,
  and the endless corridors were now more of a prison than a witch's
  antechamber. By this time, with the help of his diary, he had fixed the date
  of the dream; it came regularly on the night of the first Monday of April.
  Now the year I speak of he had made a long expedition into the hills, and had
  stridden homeward at a steady four miles an hour among the gleams and shadows
  of an April twilight. He was alone at Severns, so he had had his supper in
  the big library, where afterwards he sat watching the leaping flames on the
  open stone hearth. He was very weary, and sleep fell upon him in his chair.
  He found himself in the wood-smoke chamber, and before him the door leading
  to the unknown...  But it was no indefinite fear that now lay beyond. He knew
  clearly&mdash;though how he knew he could not tell&mdash;that each year the
  something came a room nearer, and was even now but twelve rooms off. In
  twelve years his own door would open, and then&mdash;</p>

  <p>He woke in the small hours, chilled and mazed, but with a curious new
  assurance in his heart. Hitherto the nightmare had left him in gross terror,
  unable to endure the prospect of its recurrence, till the kindly
  forgetfulness of youth relieved him. But now, though his nerves were
  fluttering, he perceived that there was a limit to the mystery. Some day it
  must declare itself and fight on equal terms.</p>

  <p>The discovery opened a new stage in his life. As he thought over the
  matter in the next few days he had the sense of being forewarned and prepared
  for some great test of courage. The notion exhilarated as much as it
  frightened him. Late at night, or on soft dripping days, or at any moment of
  lessened vitality, he would bitterly wish that he had been born an ordinary
  mortal. But on a keen morning of frost, when he rubbed himself warm after a
  cold tub, or at high noon of summer, the adventure of the dream almost
  pleased him. Unconsciously he must have braced himself to a harder
  discipline. His fitness, moral and physical, became his chief interest for
  reasons that would have been unintelligible to his friends or his
  masters.</p>

  <p>He passed through school&mdash;as I knew from Charles&mdash;an aloof and
  rather splendid figure, a magnificent athlete with a brain as well as a body,
  a good fellow in every one's opinion, but a grave one. He could have had no
  real intimates, for he never shared the secret of the spring dream. At this
  period, for some reason which he could not tell, he would have burned his
  hand off sooner than breathe a hint of it. Pure terror absolves from all
  conventions and demands a confidant, so terror, I think, must have largely
  departed from the nightmare as he grew older. Fear, indeed, remained, and awe
  and disquiet, but these are human emotions, whereas terror is of hell.</p>

  <p>Had he told any one, he would no doubt have become self-conscious and felt
  acutely his difference from other people, so it was a sound instinct which
  kept him silent. As it was, he seems to have been an ordinary schoolboy, much
  liked, and, except at odd moments, unaware of any brooding destiny. As he
  grew older, and his ambition awoke, the moments when he remembered the dream
  were apt to be disagreeable, for a boy's ambitions are strictly conventional
  and his soul revolts at the abnormal. By the time he was ready for the
  university he wanted above all things to run the mile a second faster than
  any one else, and he had hopes of academic distinction, for he was an
  excellent classic. For most of the year he lived with these hopes and was
  happy; then came April, and for a short season he was groping in dark places.
  Just before and after each dream he was in the mood of exasperation; but when
  it actually came he was plunged in a different atmosphere, and felt the
  quiver of fear and the quick thrill of expectation.</p>

  <p>During his first year at Oxford he had made an attempt to avoid it. He and
  three others were on a walking tour in Brittany in gusty spring weather, and
  came late one evening to an inn by an estuary where sea-gulls clattered about
  the windows. Youth-like they made a great and foolish feast, and sat all
  night round a bowl of punch, while school songs and "John Peel" contended
  with the dirling of the gale. At daylight they took the road again, without
  having closed an eye, and Vernon told himself that he was rid of his incubus.
  He wondered at the time why he was not more cheerful, for to his surprise he
  had a sense of loss, of regret, almost of disappointment.</p>

  <p>"That was last year," he said, and he opened the little locked diary and
  showed me the entry. "Last night I went to bed not knowing what to think, but
  far more nervous than I had been since I was a baby. I hope I didn't show it,
  but I wasn't much in the mood for guests when you turned up."</p>

  <p>"What happened?" I asked eagerly. "Did the dream come back?"</p>

  <p>He nodded and passed me the diary so that I could read that morning's
  entry. The dream had not failed him. Once more he had been in the chamber
  with the wood fire; once again he had peered at the door and wondered with
  tremulous heart what lay beyond. For the something had come nearer by two
  rooms, and was now only seven doors away. I read the bare account in his
  neat, precise handwriting, and it gave me a strong impression of being
  permitted to peep through a curtain at a stage mysteriously set. I noticed
  that he had added some lines from Keats's <i>Indian Maid's Song:</i></p>

  <p class="poem">"I would deceive her,<br>
  And so leave her,<br>
  But ah! she is so constant and so kind."</p>

  <p>There was a mark of exclamation against the "she," as if he found some
  irony in it.</p><br>

  <h3>III</h3>

  <p>He seemed to be waiting for me to speak, waiting shyly and tensely like a
  child expecting the judgment of an elder. But I found it hard to know what to
  say.</p>

  <p>"That is a very wonderful story!" I ventured at last. "I am honoured that
  you should have chosen me to tell it to. Perhaps it will be a relief to you
  to know that some one else understands what you are going through...  I don't
  suppose you want sympathy, but I would like to congratulate you on your
  fortitude."</p>

  <p>"I don't need sympathy&mdash;or congratulation. But I want help&mdash;the
  help of your brain and your experience...  You see, in seven years some
  tremendous experience is coming to me, and I want&mdash;I'd like&mdash;to
  know what it is."</p>

  <p>"I wonder if a good doctor wouldn't be the best person to consult."</p>

  <p>"No, no," he cried almost angrily. "I tell you there's nothing
  pathological about it&mdash;not now that I'm a man. I don't want it exorcised
  as if it were an evil spell. I think&mdash; now&mdash;that I'd break my heart
  if it all vanished into moonshine...  I believe in it as I believe in God,
  and I'm ready to face whatever is coming. But I want to be forewarned and
  forearmed, if possible, for it's going to be a big thing. If I only knew
  something about what was coming&mdash;even the smallest something!"</p>

  <p>Those were the days before psycho-analysis had become fashionable, but
  even then we had psychologists, and in my bewilderment I tried that tack.</p>

  <p>"Might not it all spring from some fright&mdash;some strange experience at
  any rate&mdash;which you had as a baby? Such things often make an abiding
  impression."</p>

  <p>He smiled. "You're still thinking it is pathological. Fright would account
  for recurring nightmares, but surely not for a thing so rational as
  this&mdash;a fixed day every year, the same room, the time limit. It would
  not explain the thing moving on a room last year when I had no dream."</p>

  <p>"I suppose not," I admitted. "Have you looked up your family history? I
  have heard stories of inherited obsessions and premonitions&mdash;what they
  call a 'weird' in Scotland."</p>

  <p>"I thought of that, but there's nothing&mdash;nothing. There are no
  Milburne records much beyond my grandfather, and by all accounts they were
  the most prosaic kind of business men. My mother's family&mdash;well, there's
  plenty of records there, and I've waded through most of the muniment room at
  Appleby. But there's no hint of anything mysterious in the Douglas-Ernotts.
  They were a time-serving lot, who knew how the cat was going to jump, but
  they kept out of crime and shunned anything imaginative like the plague. I
  shouldn't think one of them had ever an ambition which couldn't be put in
  terms of office or money, or a regret except that he had missed a chance of
  getting at the public purse. True-blue Whigs, all of them."</p>

  <p>"Then I'm hanged if I know what to say. But, now you've told me, I want
  you to remember that you can always count on me. I may not be able to help,
  but I'm there whenever you want me. Perhaps&mdash;you never know&mdash;the
  thing will reveal itself more clearly in the next seven years and come within
  the scope of my help. I've taken a tremendous liking to you, my dear chap,
  and we're going to be friends."</p>

  <p>He held out his hand.</p>

  <p>"That's kind of you...  Shall I tell you what I think myself? I was taught
  to believe that everything in our lives is foreordained by God. No caprice of
  our own can alter the eternal plan. Now, why shouldn't some inkling of this
  plan be given us now and then&mdash;not knowledge, but just an inkling that
  we may be ready? My dream may be a heavenly warning, a divine
  foreshadowing&mdash;a privilege, not a cross. It is a reminder that I must be
  waiting with girt loins and a lit lamp when the call comes. That's the way I
  look on it, and it makes me happy."</p>

  <p>I said nothing, for I did not share his Calvinism, but I felt that
  suddenly that library had become rather a solemn place. I had listened to the
  vow of the young Hannibal at the altar.</p><br>
 <br>

  <h2><a name="chap2"
     id="chap2">CHAPTER 2</a></h2>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p>I have a preposterous weakness for youth, and I fancy there is something
  in me which makes it accept me as a coaeval. It may be my profession. If you
  are a busy lawyer without any outside ambitions you spend your days using one
  bit of your mind, and the rest remains comparatively young and unstaled. I
  had no wife and few near relations, and while I was daily growing narrower in
  my outlook on the present and the future I cherished a wealth of sentiment
  about the past. I welcomed anything which helped me to recapture the
  freshness of boyhood, and Vernon was like a spring wind in my arid life.
  Presently we forgot that I was nearly twice his age, and slipped into the
  manner of contemporaries. He was far more at his ease with me than with the
  men of his own year. I came to think that I was the only person in the world
  who <i>knew</i> him, for though he had an infinity of acquaintances and a
  good many people who ranked as friends, I suppose I was his only comrade. For
  I alone knew the story of his dreams.</p>

  <p>My flat in Down Street became his headquarters in London, and I never knew
  when he would stick his head into my Temple chambers and insist on our dining
  or lunching together. In the following winter I went to Oxford occasionally,
  nominally to visit Charles; but my nephew led a much occupied life, and it
  generally ended by my spending my time with Vernon. I kept a horse with the
  Bicester that season and we hunted occasionally together, and we had
  sometimes a walk which filled the short winter day, and dined thereafter and
  talked far into the night. I was anxious to learn how his contemporaries
  regarded him, and I soon found that he had a prodigious reputation, which was
  by no means explained by his athletic record. He at once impressed and
  puzzled his little world. I think it was the sense of brooding power about
  him which attracted people and also kept them at a respectful distance. His
  ridiculous good looks and his gentle courtesy seemed to mark him out for
  universal popularity, but there was too much austerity for a really popular
  man. He had odd ascetic traits. He never touched wine now, he detested loose
  talk, and he was a little intolerant of youthful follies. Not that there was
  anything of the prig in him&mdash;only that his character seemed curiously
  formed and mature. For all his urbanity he had a plain, almost rugged,
  sagacity in ordinary affairs, a tough core like steel harness under a silk
  coat. That, I suppose, was the Calvinism in his blood. Had he been a less
  brilliant figure, he would probably have been set down as "pi."</p>

  <p>Charles never professed to understand him, and contented himself with
  prophesying that "old Vernon would be the devil of a swell some day." On
  inquiry I found that none of his friends forecast any special career for him;
  it would have seemed to them almost disrespectful to condescend upon such
  details. It was not what Vernon would do that fired their sluggish
  imaginations, but what they dimly conceived that he already was.</p>

  <p>There was the same fastidiousness about all his ways. I have never known a
  better brain more narrowly limited in its range. He was a first-class "pure"
  scholar, and had got a Craven and been <i>proxime</i> for the Hertford. But
  he was quite incapable of spreading himself, and his prospects looked bad for
  "Greats" since he seemed unable to acquire the smattering of loose philosophy
  demanded by that school. He was strictly circumscribed in his general
  reading; I set it down at first to insensitiveness, but came soon to think it
  fastidiousness. If he could not have exactitude and perfection in his
  knowledge, he preferred to remain ignorant. I saw in him the makings of a
  lawyer. Law was just the subject for a finical, exact, and scrupulous mind
  like his. Charles had once in his haste said that he was not a man of the
  world, and Charles had been right. He was a man of his own world, not the
  ordinary one. So with his intellectual interests. He would make his own
  culture, quite regardless of other people. I fancy that he felt that his
  overmastering private problem made it necessary to husband the energies of
  his mind.</p>

  <p>During that year I think he was quite happy and at peace about the dream.
  He had now stopped hoping or fearing; the thing had simply become part of
  him, like his vigorous young body, his slow kindliness, his patient courage.
  He rarely wanted to talk of it, but it was so much in my thoughts that I
  conducted certain researches of my own. I began by trying the psychological
  line, and plagued those of my acquaintances who had any knowledge of that
  dismal science. I cannot say I got much assistance. You see I had to state a
  hypothetical case, and was always met by a demand to produce the patient for
  cross-examination&mdash;a reasonable enough request, which of course I could
  not comply with. One man, who was full of the new Vienna doctrine, talked
  about "complexes" and "repressions" and suggested that the dream came from a
  child having been shut up by accident in a dark room. "If you can dig the
  memory of it out of his subconsciousness, you will lay that ghost," he said.
  I tried one evening to awake Vernon's earliest recollections, but nothing
  emerged. The dream itself was the furthest-back point in his recollection. In
  any case I didn't see how such an explanation would account for the steady
  development of the thing and its periodicity. I thought I might do better
  with family history, and I gave up a good deal of my leisure to the
  Douglas-Ernotts. There was nothing to be made of the Ernotts&mdash;gross
  utilitarian Whigs every one of them. The Douglas strain had more mystery in
  it, but the records of his branch of the great Scottish house were scanty,
  and sadly impersonal. Douglases many had endured imprisonment and gone to the
  scaffold, but history showed them as mere sounding names, linked to forays
  and battles and strange soubriquets, but as vague as the heroes of Homer. As
  for the Milburnes, I got an ancient aunt who had known Vernon's father to
  give me her recollections, and a friend on the Northern Circuit collected for
  me the Lancashire records. The first of them had been a small farmer
  somewhere on the Ribble; the second had become a mill-owner; and the third,
  in the early nineteenth century, had made a great fortune, had been a friend
  of William Wilberforce and later of Richard Cobden, and had sat in the first
  Reform parliament. As I looked at the portrait of that whiskered reformer,
  bland and venerable in his stiff linen and broadcloth, or at the early
  Millais of his son, the bearded Evangelical, I wondered what in them had gone
  to the making of Vernon. It was like seeking for the ancestry of a falcon
  among barnyard fowls.</p><br>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p>In the spring of 1914 I badly needed a holiday, and Lamancha asked me to
  go cruising in his yacht. He gave me permission to bring Vernon, whom he knew
  slightly, for I wanted to be near him on the first Monday of April. We were
  to join the yacht at Constantinople, and cruise through the Northern Aegean
  to Athens, and then by way of the Corinth canal to Corfu, where we would
  catch the steamer for Brindisi and so home. Vernon was at first a little
  disinclined, for he had a notion that he ought to be at Severns, but when he
  allowed himself to be persuaded he grew very keen about the trip, for he had
  been little out of England.</p>

  <p>He and I travelled by the Orient Express to Constantinople, and after
  three days there and one day at Brousa shaped our course westward. We landed
  one morning on the Gallipoli peninsula, and found birds' eggs on Achi Baba
  where, in a year's time, there was to be nothing but barbed wire and
  trenches. We spent a day at Lemnos, which at that time few people had visited
  except the British Navy, and then turned south. On the first Monday of April
  we had half a gale, an uncomfortable thing in those shallow seas. It blew
  itself out in the afternoon, and after tea we anchored for the night under
  the lee of a big island. There was a little bay carved out of the side of a
  hill; the slopes were covered with heath and some kind of scrub, and the
  young green of crops showed in the clearings. Among the thyme of the nearest
  headland a flock of goats was browsing, shepherded by a little girl in a
  saffron skirt, who sang shrilly in snatches. After the yeasty Aegean the
  scene was an idyll of pastoral peace. Vernon had all day shown signs of
  restlessness, and he now proposed a walk; so, leaving the others playing
  bridge, we two were put ashore in the dinghy.</p>

  <p>We walked northward towards the other horn of the bay, past little closes
  of fruit blossom, and thickets of wildwood, and stony patches of downland
  bright with anemones and asphodel. It was a strange, haunted world, bathed in
  a twilight of gold and amethyst, filled with a thousand aromatic scents, and
  very silent except for the wash of the waves and a far-off bleating of goats.
  Neither of us wanted to talk, being content to drink in the magic of the
  evening. Vernon walked like a man in a dream, stopping now and then to lift
  his head and stare up the long scrubby ravines to the sharp line of the
  crest.</p>

  <p>Suddenly a cuckoo's note broke into the stillness and echoed along the
  hillside. When it died away it seemed to be answered by a human voice, sweet
  and high and infinitely remote, a voice as fugitive as a scent or a
  colour.</p>

  <p>Vernon stopped short.</p>

  <p>"Listen to that," he cried. "It is the Spring Song. This has probably been
  going on here since the beginning of time. They say that nothing changes in
  these islands&mdash;only they call Demeter the Virgin Mary and Dionysos St.
  Dionysius."</p>

  <p>He sat down on a boulder and lit his pipe. "Let's burn tobacco to the
  gods," he said. "It's too enchanted to hurry through...  I suppose it's the
  way I've been educated, but I could swear I've known it all before. This is
  the season of the Spring Festival, and you may be sure it's the same here
  to-day as it was a thousand years before Homer. The winter is over, and the
  Underworld has to be appeased, and then the Goddess will come up from the
  shades."</p>

  <p>I had never heard Vernon talk like this before, and I listened with some
  curiosity. I am no classical scholar, but at that moment I too felt the spell
  of a very ancient and simple world.</p>

  <p>"This was the beginning of the year for the Greeks, remember," he went
  on&mdash;"for the Greeks as we know them, and for the old Mediterranean
  peoples before them whose ritual they absorbed. The bones of that ritual
  never altered...  You have to begin with purification&mdash;to feed the
  ghosts of the dead in the pot-holes with fireless and wineless sacrifices and
  so placate them, and to purify your own souls and bodies and the earth by
  which you live. You have your purgation herbs like buckthorn and agnus
  castus, and you have your <i>pharmakos</i>, your scapegoat, who carries away
  all impurities. And then, when that is done, you are ready for the coming of
  the Maiden. It is like Easter after Good Friday&mdash;the festival after the
  fast and penitence. It is always the woman that simple folk worship&mdash;the
  Mother who is also the Maid. Long ago they called her Pandora or Persephone,
  and now they call her the Blessed Virgin, but the notion is the
  same&mdash;the sinless birth of the divine. You may be sure it is she whom
  the peasants in this island worship, as their fathers did three thousand
  years ago&mdash;not God the Father.</p>

  <p>"The Greeks had only the one goddess," he went on, "though she had many
  names. Later they invented the Olympians&mdash;that noisy, middle-class
  family party&mdash;and the priests made a great work with their male gods,
  Apollo and the like. But the woman came first, and the woman remained. You
  may call her Demeter, or Aphrodite, or Hera, but she is the same, the Virgin
  and the Mother, the 'mistress of wild things,' the priestess of the new birth
  in spring. Semele is more than Dionysos, and even to sophisticated Athens the
  Mailed Virgin of the Acropolis was more than all the pantheon...  Don't
  imagine it was only a pretty fancy. The thing had all the beauty of nature,
  and all the terror too." He flung back his head and quoted some sonorous
  Greek.</p>

  <p>"What's that?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Euripides," he replied. "It has been well translated," and he quoted:</p>

  <p class="poem">"For her breath is on all that hath life, and she floats in
  the air<br>
  Bee-like, death-like, a wonder."</p>

  <p>"I can see it all," he cried. "The sacred basket, the honey and oil and
  wine, the torches crimsoning the meadows, the hushed, quiet people waiting on
  the revelation. They are never more than a day or two from starvation all the
  winter, and the coming of the Maiden is a matter for them of life and death.
  They wait for her as devout souls to-day wait for the Easter Resurrection. I
  can hear the ritual chant and the thin, clear music of the flutes...  Yes,
  but they were seeing things which are now hid from us&mdash;Dionysos with his
  thyrsus, and goat-feet in the thickets, and the shadows of dancing nymphs! If
  you starve for three months and put your soul into waiting for the voice from
  heaven, you are in the mood for marvels. Terror and horror, perhaps, but
  unspeakable beauty, too, and a wild hope. That was the Greek religion, not
  the Olympians and their burnt offerings. And it is the kind of religion that
  never dies."</p>

  <p>I thought this pretty good for the scion of an evangelical family, and I
  said so.</p>

  <p>He laughed. "It isn't my own creed, you know. I dislike all kinds of
  priestcraft. But, though I'm a stout Protestant, I'm inclined to think
  sometimes that it is a pity that we have departed from the practice of all
  other religions and left out the Mother of God...  Let's go on&mdash;I want
  to see what is on the other side of the cape."</p>

  <p>Beyond the little headland we came suddenly on a very different scene.
  Here was the harbour of the island. Beside a rude quay some fisher-boats lay
  at anchor with their brown sails furled. Along the water-front ran a paved
  terrace, a little dilapidated and with bushes growing in the cracks of the
  stones. Above rose a great building, showing to seaward as a blank white wall
  pierced with a few narrow windows. At first sight I took it for a monastery,
  but a second glance convinced me that its purpose had never been religious.
  It looked as if it had once been fortified, and the causeway between it and
  the sea may have mounted guns. Most of it was clearly very old, but the
  architecture was a jumble, showing here the enriched Gothic of Venice, and
  there the straight lines and round arches of the East. It had once, I
  conjectured, been the hold of some Venetian sea-king, then the palace of a
  Turkish conqueror, and was now, perhaps, the manor-house of this pleasant
  domain. The owners, whoever they might be, were absent, for not a chimney
  smoked.</p>

  <p>We passed the quay and wandered along the great terrace, which was as
  solidly masoned as a Roman road. For a little the house hung sheer above us,
  its walls level with the rock, with in three places flights of steps from the
  causeway ending in small postern doors. Obviously the main entrance was on
  the other side. There were no huts to be seen, and no sign of life except a
  little group of fishermen below on the shore, who were sitting round a fire
  over which a pot was boiling. As we continued along the terrace beyond the
  house we came to orchards and olive yards, no doubt part of the demesne, and
  had a glimpse of a rugged coast running out into the sunset.</p>

  <p>The place impressed even my sluggish fancy. This great silent castle in
  the wilds, hung between sky and earth, and all rosy in the last fires of the
  sun, seemed insubstantial as a dream. I should not have been surprised if it
  had vanished like a mirage and left us staring at a bare hillside. Only the
  solid blocks of the causeway bound us to reality. Here, beyond doubt, men had
  lived and fought far back in the ages. The impression left on my mind was of
  a place inhabited for aeons, sunk for the moment in sleep, but liable to
  awake suddenly to a fierce life. As for Vernon he seemed positively rapt.</p>

  <p>"There's your castle in Spain," he cried. "Odd thing! but I seem to have
  seen all this before. I knew before we turned the corner that there were
  olive trees there, and that the rocks tumbled just in that way into the cove.
  Listen!"</p>

  <p>The sound of voices drifted up from the beach, and there was a snatch of a
  song.</p>

  <p>"That's Antiphilos of Byzantium&mdash;you remember in the
  <i>Anthology</i>&mdash;the fisher-boys singing round the broth-pot. Lord!
  what a haunted spot! I'd like to spend the night here."</p>

  <p>I can give no reason for it, but I suddenly felt a strange uneasiness,
  which made me turn back and stride at a good pace along the terrace. We
  seemed to have blundered outside the ordinary natural world. I had a feverish
  desire to get away from the shadow of that pile of masonry, to get beyond the
  headland and in sight of the yacht. The place was wonderful, secret,
  beautiful, yet somehow menacing. Vernon clearly felt nothing of all this, for
  he grumbled at my haste. "Hang it, we're not walking for a wager," he
  complained. "There's loads of time before dinner...  I want to stay on here a
  bit. I never saw such a place."</p>

  <p>At the beginning of the paved terrace, close to the quay, we came suddenly
  upon two men, probably from the fishermen's party we had seen on the shore.
  They were well-set-up fellows, with handsome, clear-cut faces, for the true
  Greek strain is still found in the islands. We came on them by surprise as we
  turned the corner of a rock, and they may have thought from our direction
  that we were coming from the house. Anyhow they seemed to get the fright of
  their lives. Both leaped aside and looked at us with startled angry eyes.
  Then they flung up their right hands; and for a moment I thought they were
  going to attack us.</p>

  <p>But they contented themselves with spitting on their breasts and each
  holding out a clenched fist with the little finger and the thumb extended. I
  had seen this before&mdash;the ancient protection against the evil eye. But
  what impressed me was the expression in their faces. It was at Vernon that
  they stared, and when their stare moved from him it took in the pile of the
  house above. They seemed to connect us in some way with the house, and in
  their eyes there was an almost animal fear and hate...  I looked after them
  when they had passed, and observed that they were hurrying with bent heads up
  the path which may have led to their village.</p>

  <p>Vernon laughed. "Queer chaps! They looked as scared as if they had seen
  Pan."</p>

  <p>"I don't like this place," I told him when we were approaching the dinghy.
  "Some of your infernal gods and goddesses have got loose in it. I feel as if
  I want to run."</p>

  <p>"Hullo!" he cried. "You're getting as impressionable as a minor poet...
  Hark! There it is again! Do you hear? The Spring Song?"</p>

  <p>But the thin notes which drifted down from the upland no longer seemed to
  me innocent. There was something horrible about that music.</p>

  <p>Next morning, when we were steaming south in calm weather with the island
  already dim behind us, I found Vernon smoking peacefully on deck and looking
  at sea-birds through a glass. He nodded gaily as I sat down beside him.</p>

  <p>"I had the dream all right&mdash;one room nearer. But the room in which I
  wait has changed. It must be due to being out here, for hitherto I've always
  spent April in England. I suppose I furnished it unconsciously with things I
  had seen at home&mdash;there was a big lacquer cabinet for one thing, and
  something like pictures or tapestry on the walls&mdash;and there were great
  silver fire-dogs. But now it's quite bare. The same room of course&mdash;I
  couldn't mistake it&mdash;but scarcely any furniture in it except a dark lump
  in a corner...  Only the fire-dogs are the same...  Looks as if the decks
  were being cleared for action."</p>

  <p>I had expected to find him a little heavy about the eyes, but he appeared
  as fresh as if he had just come from a morning swim, and his voice had a
  boyish carelessness.</p>

  <p>"Do you know," he said, "I've lost every scrap of funk or nervousness
  about the dream? It's a privilege, not an incubus. Six years to wait! I wish
  I knew how I was going to put them in. It will be a dull business
  waiting."</p><br>

  <h3>III</h3>

  <p>Fate contrived that to Vernon, as to several million others, the next four
  years should scarcely deserve the name of dull. By the middle of August I was
  being cursed by a Guards sergeant in Chelsea barrack yard, and Vernon was
  training with his Yeomanry somewhere in Yorkshire.</p>

  <p>My path was plain compared to that of many honest men. I was a bachelor
  without ties, and though I was beyond the statutory limit for service I was
  always pretty hard trained, and it was easy enough to get over the age
  difficulty. I had sufficient standing in my profession to enable me to take
  risks. But I am bound to say I never thought of that side. I wanted, like
  everybody else, to do something for England, and I wanted to do something
  violent. For me to stay at home and serve in some legal job would have been a
  thousand times harder than to go into the trenches. Like everybody else, too,
  I thought the war would be short, and my chief anxiety was lest I should miss
  the chance of fighting. I was to learn patience and perspective during four
  beastly years.</p>

  <p>I went to France in October '14, and Vernon dined with me before I
  started. He had got a curious notion into his head. He thought that the war
  would last for full six years, and his reason was that he was convinced that
  his dream had to do with it. The opening of the last door would be on the
  battlefield&mdash;of that he was convinced. The consequence was that he was
  in no hurry. My nephew Charles, who was in the same Yeomanry, spent his days
  pleading to be sent abroad and trying to exchange into any unit he thought
  would get away first. On the few occasions I met him he raved like a lunatic
  about the imbecility of a Government that kept him kicking his heels in
  England. But Vernon, the night he dined with me, was as placid as Buddha.
  "I'm learning my job," he said, "and I've a mighty lot to learn. I ought to
  be a fair soldier in six years' time&mdash;just when the crisis is due." But
  he was very anxious about me, and wanted to get into the Guards to be beside
  me. Only his fatalism kept him from agitating for a change, for he felt that
  as he had begun in the Yeomanry, Providence most likely meant him to continue
  there. He fussed a good deal about how we were to correspond, for I seemed to
  have taken the place of his family. But on the whole I was happy about him,
  his purpose was so clear and his mind so perfectly balanced. I had stopped
  thinking seriously about the dream, for it seemed only a whimsy in the middle
  of so many urgent realities.</p>

  <p>I needn't tell you the kind of time I had in France. It was a long dismal
  grind, but I had the inestimable advantage of good health, and I was never a
  day off duty because of sickness. I suppose I enjoyed it in a sense; anyhow I
  got tremendously keen about my new profession, and rose in it far quicker
  than I deserved. I was lucky, too. As you know, I stopped something in every
  big scrap&mdash;at Festubert, Loos, Ginchy, Third Ypres, Cambrai, and
  Bapaume&mdash;so that I might have covered my sleeve with wound-stripes if I
  had been so minded. But none of the damage was serious, and I can hardly find
  the marks of it to-day. I think my worst trial was that for more than three
  years I never had a sight of Vernon.</p>

  <p>He went out in the summer of '15 to the Dardanelles and was in the
  Yeomanry fight at Suvla, where a bit of shrapnel made rather a mess of his
  left shoulder. After that he was employed on various staff jobs, and during
  '16 was engaged in some kind of secret service in the Aegean and the Levant.
  I heard from him regularly, but of course he never spoke of his work. He told
  me he had learned modern Greek and could speak it like a native, and I fancy
  he had a hand in Venizelos's revolution. Then he went back to his regiment,
  and was in the "Broken Spurs" division when the Yeomanry were dismounted. He
  was wounded again in Palestine in '17, just before the taking of Jerusalem,
  and after that was second in command of a battalion.</p>

  <p>When I was on leave in February '18 Charles dined with me at the
  Club&mdash;a much older and wiser Charles, with an empty sleeve pinned to his
  tunic, who was now employed in home training.</p>

  <p>"It's a bloody and disgusting war," said my nephew, "and if any fellow
  says he likes it, you can tell him from me that he's a liar. There's only one
  man I ever met who honestly didn't mind it, and that was old Vernon, and
  everybody knows that he's cracked."</p>

  <p>He expatiated on the exact nature of Vernon's lunacy.</p>

  <p>"Cracked&mdash;as&mdash;cracked, and a very useful kind of insanity, too.
  I often wish I had half his complaint. He simply didn't give a hang for the
  old war. Wasn't interested in it, if you see what I mean. Oh, brave as
  you-be-damned, of course, but plenty of other chaps were brave. His was the
  most cold-blooded, unearthly kind of courage. I've seen the same thing in men
  who were sick of life and wanted to be killed and knew they were going to be
  killed, but Vernon wasn't that sort. He had no notion of being
  killed&mdash;always planning out the future and talking of what he was going
  to do after the war. As you know, he got badly mauled at Suvla, and he nearly
  croaked with malaria in Crete, and he had his head chipped at Neby Samwil, so
  he didn't bear what you might call a charmed life. But some little bird had
  whispered in his ear that he wasn't going to be killed, and he believed that
  bird. You never saw a fellow in your life so much at his ease in a nasty
  place.</p>

  <p>"It wasn't that he was a fire-eater," Charles went on. "He never went out
  to look for trouble. It was simply that it made no difference to him where he
  was or what he was doing&mdash;he was the same composed old fish, smiling
  away, and keeping quiet and attending to business, as if he thought the whole
  thing rather foolishness."</p>

  <p>"You describe a pretty high class of soldier," I said. "I can't understand
  why he hasn't gone quicker up the ladder."</p>

  <p>"I can," said Charles emphatically. "He was a first-class battalion
  officer but he wasn't a first-class soldier. The trouble with him, as I say,
  is that he wasn't interested in the war. He had no initiative, you
  understand&mdash;always seemed to be thinking about something else. It's like
  Rugby football. A man may be a fine player according to the rules, but unless
  his heart is in the business and he can think out new tactics for himself he
  won't be a great player. Vernon wasn't out to do anything more than the
  immediate situation required. You might say he wasn't dead-set enough on
  winning the war."</p>

  <p>I detected in Charles a new shrewdness. "How did the others get on with
  him?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"The men believed in him and would have followed him into hell, and of
  course we all respected him. But I can't say he was exactly popular. Too
  dashed inhuman for that. He ought to fall in love with a chorus-girl and go a
  regular mucker. Oh, of course, I like him tremendously and know what a rare
  good fellow he is! But the ordinary simple-minded, deserving lad jibs at Sir
  Galahad crossed with the low-church parson and the 'Varsity don."</p>

  <p>The Broken Spurs came to France in the early summer of '18, but I had no
  chance of meeting them. My life was rather feverish during the last weeks of
  the campaign, for I was chief staff-officer to my division, and we were never
  much out of the line. Then, as you know, I nearly came by my end in
  September, when the Boche made quite a good effort in the way of a gas
  attack. It was a new gas, which we didn't understand, and I faded away like
  the grin of the Cheshire cat, and was pretty ill for a time in a base
  hospital. Luckily it didn't do me any permanent harm, but my complexion will
  be greenery-yallery till the day of my death.</p>

  <p>I awoke to consciousness in a tidy little bed to learn that the war was
  all but over and the Boche hustling to make peace. It took me some days to
  get my head clear and take notice, and then, one morning, I observed the man
  in the bed next to me. His head was a mass of bandages, but there was
  something about the features that showed which struck me as familiar. As luck
  would have it, it turned out to be Vernon. He had been badly hit, when
  commanding his battalion at the crossing of the Scheldt, and for a day or two
  had been in grave danger. He was recovering all right, but for a time neither
  of us was permitted to talk, and we used to lie and smile at each other and
  think of all the stories we would presently tell. It was just after we got
  the news of the Armistice that we were allowed to say how d'ye do. We were as
  weak as kittens, but I, at any rate, felt extraordinarily happy. We had both
  come through the war without serious damage, and a new world lay before us.
  To have Vernon beside me put the coping-stone on my contentment, and I could
  see that he felt the same. I remember the thrill I had when we could stretch
  out our arms and shake hands.</p>

  <p>Slowly we began to build up each other's records for the four years. I
  soon knew, what I had guessed before, the reason of that inhuman composure
  which Charles had described. Vernon had had a complete assurance that his day
  of fate was not due yet awhile, and therefore the war had taken a second
  place in his thoughts. Most men who fought bore the marks of it in harder
  lines about the mouth and chin and older eyes. But Vernon had kept his youth
  intact. His face had always had a certain maturity beyond his years, and his
  eyes had been curiously watchful. These traits were perhaps slightly
  intensified, but otherwise I noticed no difference.</p>

  <p>"You remember what I told you when we last met in October '14?" he said.
  "I was wrong and I'm rather sorry. I thought the war would last for six
  years, and that the last stage of my dream would be in the field. That would
  have been such a simple and right solution. As it is, I must wait."</p>

  <p>I asked if the dream had come regularly in the past four years.</p>

  <p>"Quite regularly," was the answer. "The room hasn't changed either, except
  that the dark shadow in the corner has moved, so I think it must be a human
  figure. The place is quite bare and empty now, except for the silver
  fire-dogs...  I think there is a little window in the wall, rather high
  up."</p>

  <p>"You have only two years more to wait," I said, "less&mdash; a year and a
  half." It was then November '18.</p>

  <p>"I know...  But I am impatient again. I thought the climax would come in
  the war, so I stopped speculating about it...  I thought I would be called on
  as a soldier to do something very difficult, and I was quite ready...  But
  that has all gone, and I am back in the fog. I must think it all out again
  from the beginning."</p><br>
 <br>

  <h2><a name="chap3"
     id="chap3">CHAPTER 3</a></h2>

  <p>The immediate consequence of peace was to keep Vernon and myself apart.
  You see, we neither of us got better very quickly. When his wounds were
  healed a kind of neuritis remained; he was tortured with headaches, didn't
  sleep well and couldn't recover his lost weight. He was very patient and
  cheerful about it, and did obediently what he was told, for his one object
  seemed to be to get fit again. We returned to England together, but presently
  the doctors packed him off abroad with instructions to bask in the sun and
  idle at a Riviera villa which had been dedicated to such cases. So I spent a
  lonely Christmas in London.</p>

  <p>Heaven knows I had nothing to complain of compared with most fellows, but
  I count the six months after the Armistice the most beastly in my life. I had
  never been seriously ill before, all the four years of war I had been
  brimming over with energy, and it was a new experience for me to feel slack
  and under-engined. The gas had left a sort of poison in my blood which made
  every movement an effort. I was always sleepy, and yet couldn't sleep, and to
  my horror I found myself getting jumpy and neurotic. The creak of a cart in
  the street worried me so that I wanted to cry; London noise was a nightmare,
  and when I tried the country I had a like horror of its silence. The thing
  was purely physical, for I found I could think quite clearly and sanely. I
  seemed to be two persons, one self-possessed enough watching the antics of
  the other with disgust and yet powerless to stop them.</p>

  <p>Acton Croke was reassuring. "You're a sick man, and you've got to behave
  as such," he told me. "No attempt to get back into harness. Behave as if you
  were recovering from a severe operation&mdash;regular life, no overstrain
  physical or mental, simply lie fallow and let nature do its work. You have a
  superb constitution which, given a chance, will pick up its balance. But
  don't forget that you're passing through a crisis. If you play the fool you
  may have indifferent health for the rest of your days."</p>

  <p>I was determined that at all events that mustn't happen, so I was as
  docile as a good child. As I say, I had mighty little to complain of, when
  you consider the number of good men who, far seedier than I, came back to
  struggle for their daily bread. I had made a bit of money, so I had a solid
  hump to live off. There was a dearth at the time of leaders at the Bar, and I
  could have stepped at once into a bigger practice than I had ever dreamed of.
  Also, I had a chance, if I wished, of becoming one of the law officers of the
  Crown. I was still a member of Parliament, and at the December election,
  though I had never gone near the place, my old constituency had returned me
  with a majority of more than ten thousand. A pretty gilded position for a
  demobbed soldier! But for the present I had to put all that aside and think
  only of getting well.</p>

  <p>There has been a good deal of nonsense talked about the horror of war
  memories and the passionate desire to bury them. The vocal people were apt to
  be damaged sensitives, who were scarcely typical of the average man. There
  were horrors enough, God knows, but in most people's recollections these were
  overlaid by the fierce interest and excitement, even by the comedy of it. At
  any rate that was the case with most of my friends, and it was certainly the
  case with me. I found a positive pleasure in recalling the incidents of the
  past four years. The war had made me younger. You see&mdash;apart from
  regular officers&mdash;I had met few of my own year and standing. I had
  consorted chiefly with youth, and had recovered the standpoint of twenty
  years ago. That was what made my feeble body so offensive. I could not regard
  myself as a man in middle age, but as a sick undergraduate whose malady was
  likely to keep him out of the Boat or the Eleven.</p>

  <p>You would have laughed if you could have seen the way I spent my time. I
  was so angry with my ill-health that I liked to keep on reminding myself of
  the days when I had been at the top of my form. I remember I made out a
  complete record of my mountaineering exploits, working them out with diagrams
  from maps and old diaries, and telling myself furiously that what I had once
  done I could do again...  I got out my old Oxford texts and used to construe
  bits of the classics, trying to recapture the mood when those things meant a
  lot to me...  I read again all the books which used to be favourites, but
  which I hadn't opened for a score of years. I turned up the cram books for
  the Bar exams, and the notes I had taken in my early days in chambers, and
  the reports of my first cases. It wasn't sentiment, but a deliberate attempt
  to put back the clock, and, by recalling the feelings of twenty-five, to
  convince myself that I had once been a strong man...  I even made risky
  experiments. I went up to Oxford in vacation and managed to get put up in my
  old diggings in the High. That would have been intolerable if they had
  recalled war tragedies, but they didn't. The men who had shared them with me
  were all alive&mdash;one a Colonial bishop, one a stockbroker, another high
  up in the Indian Civil Service. It did me good to see the big shabby
  sitting-room where, in my day, a barrel of beer had adorned one corner. In
  March, too, I spent three nights at a moorland inn on the Borders which had
  once been the headquarters of a famous reading-party. That was not quite so
  successful, for the weather and the food were vile, and I was driven to
  reflect on the difference of outlook between twenty and forty-three.</p>

  <p>Still my childishness did me good, and I began slowly to gain ground. The
  spring helped me, which was early that year, you remember, so that the
  blossom had begun on the fruit trees in the first days of April. I found that
  it was the time just before the war that it comforted me most to recall, for
  then I had been healthy enough and a creature more near my present state than
  the undergraduate of twenty. I think, too, it was because those years were
  associated with Vernon. He was never much out of my mind, and the reports
  from him were cheering. The headaches had gone, he had recovered his power of
  sleep, and was slowly putting on weight. He had taken to sailing a small boat
  again, had bought a racing cutter, and had come in third in one of the events
  at the Cannes Regatta.</p>

  <p>I had this last news in a letter which reached me while I was staying at
  Minster Carteron, and it turned my mind back to the yachting trip I had made
  with Vernon in 1914 in the Aegean. It revived the picture I had almost
  forgotten&mdash;the green island flushed with spring, the twilight haunted
  with wild music, the great white house hanging like a cliff over the sea. I
  had felt the place sinister&mdash;I remembered the two men with scared faces
  and their charm against the evil eye&mdash;and even after five years a faint
  aura of distaste lingered about the memory. That was sufficient to awake my
  interest, and one afternoon I rummaged in the library. Plakos had been the
  island's name, and I searched for it in gazetteers.</p>

  <p>It was the day of the famous April snowstorm which wrought such havoc
  among English orchards. The windows of the great room were blurred with
  falling snow, and the fires on the two hearths were hissing and spluttering
  while I pursued my researches. Folliot, I remember, was dozing beside one of
  them in an arm-chair. You know old Folliot, with his mild cattish ways and
  his neat little Louis Napoleon beard. He wants to be the Horace Walpole of
  our time, and publishes every few years a book of reminiscences, from which
  it would appear that he has been the confidant of every great man in Europe
  for the last half-century. He has not much of a mind, but he has a good
  memory, and after all there is a faint interest about anybody who has dined
  out in good company for fifty years.</p>

  <p>I woke the old fellow when I dropped by misadventure a big atlas on the
  floor, and he asked testily what I was after.</p>

  <p>"I'm trying to find a beastly Greek islet," I said. "You haven't by any
  chance in your travels visited a place called Plakos?"</p>

  <p>The name roused him. "No," he said, "but of course I have often heard of
  it. It belonged to Shelley Arabin."</p>

  <p>"Now, who on earth was Shelley Arabin?"</p>

  <p>"You young men!" old Folliot sighed. "Your memories are so short and your
  ignorance so vast. Shelley Arabin died last year, and had half a column in
  the <i>Times,</i> but he will have a chapter in my memoirs. He was one of the
  most remarkable men of his day. Shelley Arabin&mdash;to think you never heard
  of him! Why, I knew his father."</p>

  <p>I drew up an arm-chair to the hearth opposite him. "It's a foul
  afternoon," I said, "and there's nothing to do. I want to hear about Shelley
  Arabin. I take it from his name that he was a Levantine."</p>

  <p>Folliot was flattered by my interest. He had begun to bore people, for the
  war had created a mood unfavourable to his antique gossip. He still stayed a
  good deal in country houses, but spent most of his time in the libraries and
  got rather snubbed when he started on his reminiscences.</p>

  <p>"Bless you, no! A most ancient English house&mdash;the Arabins of Irtling
  in Essex. Gone out for good now, I fear. As a boy I remember old Tom
  Arabin&mdash;a shabby old bandit, who came to London once in five years and
  insulted everybody and then went back again. He used to dine with my family,
  and I remember watching him arrive, for I had a boyish romance about the man
  who had been a friend of Byron. Yes, he was with Byron when he died at
  Missolonghi, and he was an intimate of all the poets of that
  time&mdash;Byron, Shelley&mdash;he called his son after Shelley&mdash;Keats
  too, I think&mdash;there's a mention of him in the <i>Letters</i> I'm almost
  sure&mdash;and he lived with Landor in Italy till they quarrelled. A most
  picturesque figure, but too <i>farouche,</i> for comfort. With him a word was
  a blow, you understand. He married&mdash;now, who did he marry?&mdash;one of
  the Manorwaters, I fancy. Anyhow, he led her the devil of a life. He bought
  or stole or acquired somehow the island of Plakos, and used it as a base from
  which to descend periodically upon the civilized world. Not a pleasant old
  gentleman, but amazingly decorative. You may have seen his translation of
  Pindar. I have heard Jebb say that it was a marvellous piece of scholarship,
  but that his English style was the exact opposite of everything that Pindar
  stood for. Dear me! How short the world's memory is!"</p>

  <p>"I want to hear about his son," I said.</p>

  <p>"You shall&mdash;you shall! Poor Shelley, I fear he had not the kind of
  upbringing which is commonly recommended for youth. Tom disliked his son, and
  left him to the care of the family priest&mdash;they were Catholics of
  course. All his boyhood he spent in that island among the peasants and the
  kind of raffish company that his father invited to the house. What kind of
  company? Well, I should say all the varieties of humbug that Europe
  produces&mdash;soldiers of fortune, and bad poets, and the gentry who have
  made their native countries too hot for them. Plakos was the refuge of every
  brand of outlaw, social and political. Ultimately the boy was packed off to
  Cambridge, where he arrived speaking English a generation out of date, and
  with the tastes of a Turkish pasha, but with the most beautiful manners. Tom,
  when he wasn't in a passion, had the graciousness of a king, and Shelley was
  a young prince in air and feature. He was terribly good-looking in a way no
  man has a right to be, and that prejudiced him in the eyes of his young
  contemporaries. Also there were other things against him."</p>

  <p>"How long did Cambridge put up with him?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"One year. There was a scandal&mdash;rather a bad one, I fancy&mdash;and
  he left under the blackest kind of cloud. Tom would not have him at home, but
  he gave him a good allowance, and the boy set up in London. Not in the best
  society, you understand, but he had a huge success in the half-world. Women
  raved about him, and even when his reputation was at its worst, he would be
  seen at a few good houses...  I suppose a lawyer does not concern himself
  with poetry, but I can assure you that Shelley Arabin made quite a name for
  himself in the late eighties. I believe bibliophiles still collect his first
  editions. There was his epic on the Fall of Jerusalem&mdash;a very remarkable
  performance as a travesty of history. And there were his love sonnets,
  beautiful languid things, quite phosphorescent with decay. He carried
  Swinburne and Beaudelaire a stage further. Well, that mood has gone from the
  world, and Shelley Arabin's reputation with it, but at one time sober critics
  felt obliged to praise him even when they detested him. He was a red-hot
  revolutionary, too, and used to write pamphlets blackguarding British policy
 ...  I saw quite a lot of him in those days, and I confess that I found him
  fascinating. Partly it was his beauty and his air, partly that he was like
  nobody I had ever met. He could talk wonderfully in his bitter, high-coloured
  way. But I never liked him. Oh no, I never liked him. There was always a
  subtle cruelty about him. Old Tom had been a blackguard, but he had had a
  heart&mdash;Shelley, behind all his brilliance, was ice and stone. I think
  most people came to feel this, and he had certainly outstayed his welcome
  before he left London."</p>

  <p>"What made him leave?"</p>

  <p>"His father's death. Tom went out suddenly from old age just before the
  war between Greece and Turkey. Shelley left England with a great gasconade of
  Greek patriotism&mdash;he was going to be a second Byron and smite the
  infidel. By all accounts he did very little. I doubt if he had old Tom's
  swashbuckling courage: indeed I have heard ugly stories of the white feather
 ...  Anyhow England knew him no more. He married a girl he met in
  Rome&mdash;Scotch&mdash;a Miss Hamilton, I think, but I never knew of what
  Hamiltons. He treated her shamefully after the Arabin tradition. She did not
  live long, and there were no children, I believe, and now Shelley is dead and
  the Arabins are extinct. Not a pleasant family, you will say, and small loss
  to the world. But there was a certain quality, too, which under happier
  circumstances might have made them great. And assuredly they had looks. There
  was something almost unholy about Shelley's beauty in his early days. It made
  men instinctively dislike him. If I had had a son I should have liked him to
  be snub-nosed and bullet-headed, for ugliness in the male is a security for
  virtue and a passport to popularity."</p>

  <p>This was probably a sentence from one of Folliot's silly books of
  reminiscences. My curiosity about Plakos was not exhausted, and I asked what
  kind of life had been lived there. "The house is a tremendous affair," I
  said, "with room for a regiment."</p>

  <p>"I know," said Folliot, "and it was often full. I had always a great
  curiosity to go there, though I daresay I should have found the atmosphere
  too tropical for my taste. Shelley never invited me, but if I had arrived he
  could scarcely have turned me away. I entertained the notion at one time, but
  I kept putting it off till my taste for that kind of adventure declined...
  No, I have never been nearer Plakos than Athens, where I once spent a
  fortnight when Fanshawe was our Minister there. I asked about Shelley, of
  course, and Fanshawe gave me an ugly report. Plakos, you must know, is a
  remote and not over-civilized island where the writ of the Greek Government
  scarcely runs, so it was very much a patriarchal despotism. I gathered that
  Shelley was not a popular landlord. There had been many complaints, and one
  or two really horrid stories of his treatment of the peasantry. It seemed
  that he saw a good deal of company, and had made his house a resort for the
  rascality of Europe. The rascality&mdash;not merely the folly, as in his
  father's time. The place fairly stank in Fanshawe's nostrils. 'The swine
  still calls himself an Englishman,' he told me, 'still keeps his English
  domicile, so we get the blame of his beastliness. And all the while, too, he
  is sluicing out venom about England. He is clever enough to keep just inside
  the tinpot Greek law. I'd give a thousand pounds to see him clapped in
  gaol.'"</p>

  <p>I had heard all I wanted to know, and picked up a book, while Folliot
  busied himself with the newspaper. A little later he interrupted me.</p>

  <p>"I have just remembered something else. You knew Wintergreen, the
  archaeologist? He was at the British school in Athens, and then excavated
  Hittite remains in Asia Minor. Poor fellow, he died of dysentery as an
  intelligence officer in Mesopotamia. Well, Wintergreen once spoke to me of
  Plakos. I suppose he had been there, for he had been everywhere. We were
  talking, I remember, one night in the club about Gilles de Rais&mdash;the
  French Bluebeard, you know, the friend of Joan of Arc&mdash;and I asked if
  anything approaching that kind of miscreant still existed on the globe.
  Somebody said that the type was fairly common in the East, and mentioned some
  Indian potentate. Wintergreen broke in. 'You don't need to go to the East,'
  he said. 'You can find it in Europe,' and he started to speak of Shelley
  Arabin. I don't recollect what exactly he said, but it was pretty bad, and of
  course strictly libellous. By his account Shelley had become a connoisseur
  and high priest of the uttermost evil, and the cup of his iniquities was
  nearly full. It seemed that Wintergreen had been in the island excavating
  some ancient remains and living among the peasants, and had heard tales that
  sickened him. He thought that some day soon the great house would go flaming
  to heaven, set alight by an outraged people.</p>

  <p>"Well, it hasn't happened." Folliot returned to his <i>Times.</i> "Shelley
  has died in his bed, which is perhaps more than he deserved. Not agreeable
  people, I fear. It is a good thing that he left no posterity."</p>

  <p>That evening I thought a good deal about Plakos. I was glad to have
  discovered the reason for the aversion which I had felt on our visit, and was
  inclined to believe that I must be a more sensitive person than my friends
  would admit. After that the subject passed from my mind.</p>

  <p>By the end of April I was so much recovered that I went back to my
  practice at the Bar, and was almost snowed under by the briefs which
  descended on my shoulders as soon as there was a rumour of my return. It
  would have been a difficult job to select, and I daresay I should have
  slipped into overwork, had I not been made a Law Officer. That, so to speak,
  canalized my duties, and since my task was largely novel and, at the moment,
  of extraordinary interest, the change completed my convalescence. In May I
  was my normal self, and when Vernon returned to England in June he found me
  eating, sleeping, and working as in the old days&mdash;a fitter man, indeed,
  than in 1914, for the war seemed to have drawn off the grosser humours of
  middle life.</p>

  <p>Vernon, too, was fit again. If a young man starts with a fine constitution
  and a strong character, and applies all the powers of his mind to the task of
  getting well, he is almost certain to succeed. He came back to London a lean,
  sunburnt creature, with an extraordinarily <i>rarified</i> look about him. He
  had lost nothing of his youth, indeed he scarcely looked his twenty-five
  years; but he had been fined down and tautened and tested, so that his face
  had a new spirituality in it as if there was a light shining behind. I have
  noticed the same thing in other cases of head wounds. You remember how Jim
  Barraclough, who used to be a heavy red-haired fellow, came out of hospital
  looking like a saint in an Italian primitive.</p>

  <p>Vernon was changed in other ways. You see, he belonged to a generation
  which was nearly cleaned out by the war, and he had scarcely a friend of his
  own year left except my nephew Charles. That should not have meant so much to
  him as to other people, for he had never depended greatly on friends, but I
  think the thought of all the boys who had been at school and college with him
  lying under the sod gave him a feeling of desperate loneliness, and flung him
  back more than ever on himself. I could see that even I meant less to him
  than before, though I still meant a good deal.</p>

  <p>I was partly to blame for that, perhaps. The war had altered everybody's
  sense of values, and unconsciously I had come to take his dream less
  seriously. I had got into a mood of accepting things as they came and living
  with short horizons, and the long perspective which dominated his thoughts
  seemed to me a little out of the picture. I was conscious of this change in
  myself, and strove not to show it, but he must have felt it, and the blinds
  came down ever so little between us. For it was clear that the dream meant
  more than ever to him. He was in the last lap now, had rounded the turn and
  was coming up the straight, and every nerve and sinew were on the stretch. I
  couldn't quite live up to this ardour, though I tried hard, and with that
  lightning instinct of his he was aware of it, and was sparing of his
  confidences. The thing made me miserable, for it increased his loneliness,
  and I longed for the next year to be over and the apocalyptic to be driven
  out of his life. The mere fact that I took for granted that nothing would
  happen showed that I had lost my serious interest in his dream. Vernon had to
  outgrow a childish fancy, as one outgrows a liability to
  chicken-pox&mdash;that was all.</p>

  <p>He had become harder too, as a consequence of loneliness. You remember
  that curious summer of 1919 when everybody was feverishly trying to forget
  the war. They were crazy days, when nobody was quite himself. Politicians
  talked and writers wrote clotted nonsense, statesmen chased their tails, the
  working man wanted to double his wages and halve his working hours at a time
  when the world was bankrupt, youth tried to make up for the four years of
  natural pleasure of which it had been cheated, and there was a general
  loosening of screws and a rise in temperature. It was what I had looked for,
  and I sympathized with a good deal of it, but, Lord bless me! Vernon was like
  an Israelitish prophet at a feast of Baal. I recalled what Charles had said
  about him in the war, and I wondered if Charles had not been right. Vernon
  seemed destitute of common humour.</p>

  <p>I took him to dine at the Thursday Club, which had just been started.
  There he behaved well enough, for he found people who could talk his own
  language. But I noticed how complete was his apathy when politics were the
  subject of conversation. He was as uninterested in the setting to rights of
  the world as a hermit in a cell. He was oddly uncompanionable, too.
  Burminster's rollicking chaff got nothing out of him but a Monna Lisa smile.
  "What has happened to the boy?" that worthy asked me afterwards. "Shell-shock
  or what? Has he left a bit of his mind out in France? He's the most
  buttoned-up thing I ever struck."</p>

  <p>He was worse with the ordinary young man. I gave a dinner or two for him,
  and, as we had one club in common, we occasionally found ourselves together
  in smoking-room gatherings. I had an immense pity for youth struggling to
  adjust its poise, and often I could have found it in my heart to be annoyed
  with Vernon's uncanny balance, which was not far from egotism. These poor
  lads were splashing about in life, trying to find their feet, and for their
  innocent efforts he had only a calm contempt. He sat like a skeleton at the
  feast, when they chattered about their sporting and amorous ventures, and
  discussed with abysmal ignorance how money was to be made in a highly
  expensive world. I have a vivid recollection of his courteous, insulting
  aloofness.</p>

  <p>"What rot to say that the war has done any good," he remarked to me once
  as we walked back to the flat. "It has killed off the men, and left only the
  half-wits."</p>

  <p>Charles, now endeavouring without much success to earn a living in the
  City, was vehement on the subject, and he had a characteristic explanation.
  "Vernon has become a wonderful old fossil," he said. "Not gone to seed, like
  some of the rest, but a fossil&mdash;dried up&mdash;mummified. It isn't
  healthy, and I'm pretty certain about the cause. He's got something on his
  mind, and I shouldn't be surprised if he was preparing to come an everlasting
  cropper. I think it's a girl."</p>

  <p>It certainly was not a girl. I often wished it had been, for to a fellow
  as lonely as Vernon the best cure, as I saw it, would have been to fall in
  love. People had taken furiously to dancing, and that summer, though there
  were no big balls, every dinner-party seemed to end in a dance, and every
  restaurant was full of rag-time music and ugly transatlantic shuffling. For
  youth it was a good way of working off restlessness, and foolish middle age
  followed the guiding of youth. I had no fault to find with the fashion. The
  poor girls, starved for four years of their rights, came from dull war-work
  and shadowed schoolrooms determined to win back something. One could forgive
  a good deal of shrillness and bad form in such a case. My one regret was that
  they made such guys of themselves. Well-born young women seemed to have taken
  for their models the cretinous little oddities of the film world.</p>

  <p>One night Vernon and I had been dining at the house of a cousin of mine
  and had stayed long enough to see the beginning of the dance that followed.
  As I looked on, I had a sharp impression of the change which five years had
  brought. This was not, like a pre-war ball, part of the ceremonial of an
  assured and orderly world. These people were dancing as savages
  danced&mdash;to get rid of or to engender excitement. Apollo had been ousted
  by Dionysos. The nigger in the band, who came forward now and then and sang
  some gibberish, was the true master of ceremonies. I said as much to Vernon,
  and he nodded. He was watching with a curious intensity the faces that passed
  us.</p>

  <p>"Everybody is leaner," I said, "and lighter on their feet. That's why they
  want to dance. But the women have lost their looks."</p>

  <p>"The women!" he murmured. "Look at that, I beseech you!"</p>

  <p>It was a tall girl, who was dancing with a handsome young Jew, and
  dancing, as I thought, with a notable grace. She was very slim, and clearly
  very young, and I daresay would have been pretty, if she had let herself
  alone. I caught a glimpse of fine eyes, and her head was set on her neck like
  a flower on its stalk. But some imp had inspired her to desecrate the gifts
  of the Almighty. Her hair was bobbed, she had too much paint and powder on
  her face, she had some kind of barbaric jewels in her ears which put her head
  out of drawing, and she wore a preposterous white gown. Don't ask me to
  describe it, for I am not an expert on dress; but it seemed to me wrong by
  every canon of decency and art. It had been made, no doubt, with the
  intention of being provocative, and its audacious lines certainly revealed a
  great deal of its wearer's body. But the impression was rather of an outrage
  perpetrated on something beautiful, a foolish ill-bred joke. There was an
  absurd innocence about the raddled and half-clad girl&mdash;like a child who
  for an escapade has slipped down to the drawing-room in her nightgown.</p>

  <p>Vernon did not feel as I felt. His eyes followed her for a little, and
  then he turned to me with a face like stone.</p>

  <p>"So much for our righteous war," he said grimly. "It's to produce
  <i>that</i> that so many good fellows died."</p><br>
 <br>

  <h2><a name="chap4"
     id="chap4">CHAPTER 4</a></h2>

  <p>Early in November I went down to Wirlesdon for the first big covert shoot.
  I am not a great performer with the gun, and you will not find me often in
  the first flight in the hunting-field, but, busy as I was, I made time now
  for an occasional day's shooting or hunting, for I had fallen in love with
  the English country, and it is sport that takes you close to the heart of it.
  Is there anything in the world like the corner of a great pasture hemmed in
  with smoky brown woods in an autumn twilight: or the jogging home after a
  good run when the moist air is quickening to frost and the wet ruts are
  lemon-coloured in the sunset; or a morning in November when, on some upland,
  the wind tosses the driven partridges like leaves over tall hedges, through
  the gaps of which the steel-blue horizons shine? It is the English winter
  that intoxicates me more even than the English May, for the noble bones of
  the land are bare, and you get the essential savour of earth and wood and
  water.</p>

  <p>It was a mild evening as we walked back from the last stand to the house,
  and, though so late in the year, there was still a show in the garden
  borders. I like the rather languid scent of autumn flowers when it is
  chastened by a touch of wood smoke from the gardeners' bonfires; it wakes so
  many memories and sets me thinking. This time my thoughts were chiefly of
  Vernon, whom I had not seen for several months. We were certainly drawing
  apart, and I didn't see how it could be avoided. I was back in the ordinary
  world again, with a mighty zest for it, and he was vowed and consecrated to
  his extraordinary obsession. I could not take it seriously myself, but about
  one thing I was grave enough&mdash;its effect on Vernon. Nothing would happen
  when next April came&mdash;of that I was convinced, but if nothing happened
  what would Vernon do? The linch-pin would be out of his life. At twenty-six,
  with a war behind him, a man should have found his groove in life, but at
  twenty-six Vernon would be derelict, like one who has trained himself
  laboriously for an occupation which is gone. I put aside the notion that
  anything could happen, for in my new mood I was incredulous of miracles. But
  my scepticism did not dispel my anxiety.</p>

  <p>The hall at Wirlesdon is a big, comfortable, stone-flagged Georgian place,
  and before one of the fireplaces, with two great Coromandel screens for a
  shelter, there was the usual encampment for tea. It was a jolly
  sight&mdash;the autumn dusk in the tall windows, the blazing logs, and the
  group of fresh-coloured young faces. I had gone straight to the covert-side
  that morning, so I had still to greet my hostess, and I was not clear who
  were staying in the house. Mollie Nantley, busied in making tea, muttered
  some indistinct introductions, and I bowed to several unfamiliar young women
  in riding-habits who were consuming poached eggs. I remembered that this was
  the Saturday country for the Mivern, and presently one of the red backs
  turned towards me, and I saw that it was Vernon.</p>

  <p>The Mivern cut-away became him uncommonly well, and his splashed breeches
  and muddy boots corrected the over-precision which was apt to be the fault of
  his appearance. Once he would have made a bee-line towards me, but now he
  contented himself with a smile and a wave of his hand. We were certainly
  drifting apart...  He was talking to one of the Nantley girls, a pretty shy
  creature, just out of the schoolroom, and Tom Nantley, her father, made a
  third in the conversation. As I drank my tea I looked round the little
  gathering. There were Bill Harcus and Heneage Wotton and young Cheviot who
  had been of the shooting party. Lady Altrincham was there with her wonderful
  pearls&mdash;she is one of those people whose skin nourishes pearls, and she
  is believed to take them to bed with her. Young Mrs. Lamington, who had been
  walking with the guns, was kicking the burning logs with her mannish shoes
  and discussing politics with the son of the house, Hugo Brune, who was in
  Parliament. There were several girls, all with clear skins and shorn curls,
  and slim, straight figures. I found myself for the first time approving the
  new fashion in clothes. These children looked alert and vital like pleasant
  boys, and I have always preferred Artemis to Aphrodite.</p>

  <p>But there was one girl who caught and held my eyes. She had been hunting,
  and her flat-brimmed hat was set deep on her small head and rather tilted
  back, for her bobbed hair gave it no support. Her figure, in a well-cut coat
  and habit, was graceful and workmanlike, and there was a rakish elegance
  about her pose, as she stood with one foot on the stone curb of the hearth,
  holding a tea-cup as a Wise Virgin may have carried a lamp. But there was
  little of the Wise Virgin about her face. Any colour the weather might have
  whipped into it had disappeared under a recent powdering, and my impression
  was of very red lips against a dead white background. She had been talking
  over her left shoulder to her hostess, and now her eyes were roaming about
  the place, with a kind of arrogant nonchalance. They met mine, and I saw that
  they were curiously sullen and masterful. Then they passed from me, for a
  middle-aged lawyer did not interest them, dwelt for a moment on Cheviot and
  Wotton, who were having an argument about woodcock, and finally rested on
  Vernon. She had the air of being bored with her company.</p>

  <p>Vernon, talking idly to Tom Nantley, suddenly found himself addressed.</p>

  <p>"Your mare wants practice in jumping stone walls," she said. "You'll cut
  her knees to ribbons. Better try her in caps next time."</p>

  <p>You can cut into a conversation gracefully, and you can cut in rudely.
  This girl did it rudely. I could see Vernon's face harden as he replied that
  this bit of the Mivern country was strange to him.</p>

  <p>"It's the only decent going in the shire. I'm sick of the rotten pastures
  in the vale country. What on earth does one hunt for except for pace?"</p>

  <p>"Some of us hunt to follow hounds," was Vernon's curt rejoinder.</p>

  <p>She laughed&mdash;a rather ugly, hard little laugh. "Follow your
  grandmother! If hounds are all you care about you may as well go beagling!
  Give me a cigarette, will you?"</p>

  <p>"Sorry. I haven't any," he replied.</p>

  <p>Several men proffered cases. "You'll find heaps, Corrie dear," Mollie
  Nantley said, "in the box behind you." The girl reached behind her for the
  box and offered it to Vernon. When he declined she demanded a match, and
  Vernon, with an ill grace, lit her cigarette. It was plain that he detested
  her manners.</p>

  <p>So most certainly did I. The little incident I had witnessed was oddly
  ill-bred and brazen. And yet "brazen" was not quite the word, for it implies
  self-consciousness. This masterful girl had no shadow of doubt as to her
  behaviour. She seemed to claim the right to domineer, like a barbaric
  princess accustomed to an obsequious court. Yes, "barbaric" was the right
  epithet. Mollie had called her "Corrie," and the name fitted her. No doubt
  she had been baptized Cora or Corisande, names which for me recalled the
  spangles and sawdust of a circus.</p>

  <p>She had decided that Vernon was the most interesting of the lot of us, and
  she promptly annexed him, moving to his side and swinging on an arm of a
  tapestry chair. But Vernon was a hard fellow to drive against his will. His
  air was a frigid courtesy, and presently he went up to his hostess. "We must
  be off, Lady Nantley," he said, "for it's getting dark, and we are eight
  miles from home." He collected two of the men and three of the hunting girls,
  like a chaperone at a ball, shook hands with Mollie and Tom, nodded to me,
  and marched to the door.</p>

  <p>The girl, who was apparently my fellow-guest, followed him with her eyes,
  and her scarlet lips seemed to twitch in a flicker of amusement. If she had
  been rude, so had been Vernon, and, had she known it, it was something of a
  triumph to have cracked his adamantine good manners. When the party had gone,
  she strolled to the front of the hearth, stretched her arms above her head,
  and yawned.</p>

  <p>"Lord, how stiff I am!" she proclaimed. "Heigho for a bath! I hope you've
  the right kind of bath salts, Mollie, or I'll be on crutches to-morrow. Come
  and talk to me, Dolly!" She picked up her crop, made a noose with the lash
  around the waist of one of the daughters of the house and drew her with her.
  The child, to my surprise, went smilingly.</p>

  <p>I, too, had a bath, and read papers till it was time to dress. I felt
  happier about Vernon, for the sight of his unmistakable ill-temper seemed to
  bring him into the common human category. I had never seen him show dislike
  so markedly to any human being as to that atrocious girl, and I considered
  that it would be a good thing if his Olympian calm could be ruffled more
  often in the same way. I wondered casually who she could be, and why the
  Nantleys should have her to stay. Probably she was some daughter of
  profiteers who had bought her way into an unfamiliar world, though that would
  not explain her presence at Wirlesdon. But an ill-bred young woman did not
  interest me enough for my thoughts to dwell long on her, and my only prayer
  was that I might not be placed next her at dinner.</p>

  <p>It was a very young party which I found assembled in Mollie's
  sitting-room, and a hasty glance convinced me that I would be sent in with
  Mrs. Lamington. Old Folliot was there, and presently he sidled up to me to
  tell me a new piece of gossip. Having been out all day in strong air I was
  ravenous, and impatient for the announcement of dinner.</p>

  <p>"Now, who are we waiting for?" Tom Nantley fussed around. "Oh, Corrie, of
  course. Corrie is always late. Confound that girl, she has probably gone to
  sleep in her bath. Pam, you go and dig her out...  Hullo, here she comes at
  last!"</p>

  <p>In her hunting-kit she had looked handsome in an outlandish way, but as
  she swept down&mdash;without any apology&mdash;on our hungry mob there was no
  question of her beauty. For one thing she walked superbly. Few women can
  walk, and the trouble about the new fashion in clothes is that it emphasizes
  ugly movement. She wore a gown of a shade of green which would have ruined
  most people's looks, but she managed to carry it off, and something more. For
  a young girl she was far too heavily made up, but that, too, she forced one
  to accept. I suddenly had a new view of her, and realized that there was
  quality here, a masterfulness which might charm, an arrogance which perhaps
  was not <i>blas&eacute;</i> but virginal.</p>

  <p>I realized, too, that I had seen her before. This was the girl whom Vernon
  and I had watched at my cousin's dance in July. I wondered if he had
  understood this in their encounter at the tea-table.</p>

  <p>I had barely recovered from this surprise, when I had another. Folliot's
  hand was on my arm and he was purring in my ear:</p>

  <p>"We talked once of Shelley Arabin, and I told you he left no children. My
  memory betrayed me, for that young lady is his daughter. She has the true
  Arabin eyes and all their unfathomable conceit. She is what in my day we
  would have called 'shocking bad form.' Rather common, I think."</p>

  <p>From which I knew that she must have dealt hardly with old Folliot.</p>

  <p>At dinner I sat between Mollie and Mrs. Lamington, and since my hostess
  had the garrulous Cheviot on her right hand, I devoted myself to my other
  neighbour. That charming lady, who gives to political intrigue what time she
  can spare from horseflesh, had so much to tell me that I had no need to exert
  myself. She was eloquent on the immense importance of certain pending
  Imperial appointments, especially on the need of selecting men with the right
  kind of wives, the inference being that George Lamington's obvious
  deficiencies might be atoned for by the merits of his lady. I must have
  assented to everything that she said, for she told Mollie afterwards that the
  war had improved me enormously and had broadened my mind. But as a matter of
  fact I was thinking of Miss Arabin.</p>

  <p>She sat nearly opposite to me, and I could watch her without staring. Her
  manner seemed to alternate between an almost hoydenish vivacity and complete
  abstraction. At one moment she would have her young neighbours laughing and
  protesting volubly, and then she would be apparently deaf to what they said,
  so that they either talked across her or turned to their other partners...
  In these latter moods her eyes seemed almost sightless, so wholly were they
  lacking in focus or expression. Sometimes they rested on the table flowers,
  sometimes on the wall before her, sometimes on Mrs. Lamington and
  myself&mdash;but they were always unseeing. Instead of their former
  sullenness, they seemed to have a brooding innocence...  I noticed, too, the
  quality of her voice when she spoke. It was singularly arresting&mdash;
  clear, high, and vital. She talked the usual staccato slang, but though she
  rarely finished a sentence grammatically, the cadence and intonation were
  always rounded off to a satisfying close. Only her laugh was ugly, as if it
  were a forced thing. Every other sound that came from her had a musical
  completeness.</p>

  <p>She had the foreign trick of smoking before the close of dinner, and, as
  if to preserve her beautiful fingers from contamination, before lighting a
  cigarette she would draw on her right hand a silk glove of the same colour as
  her gown. The Nantley's seemed to be accustomed to this habit, but it at last
  withdrew Mrs. Lamington from her Imperial propaganda.</p>

  <p>"What an extraordinary young woman!" she whispered to me. "Who is she? Is
  she a little mad, or only foreign?"</p>

  <p>I paraphrased old Folliot in my reply: "Pure English, but lives
  abroad."</p>

  <p>The green glove somehow recalled that April evening at Plakos. This
  outlandish creature was interesting, for God knew what strange things were in
  her upbringing and her ancestry. Folliot was an old fool; she might be
  odious, but she was assuredly not "common." As it chanced the end of dinner
  found her in one of her fits of absent-mindedness, and she trailed out of the
  room with the other women like a sleep-walker. The two youngsters who had
  been her companions at table stared after her till the door closed.</p>

  <p>Later in the drawing-room I returned to my first impression. The girl was
  detestable. I would have liked a sleepy evening of bridge, but the young
  harpy turned the sober halls of Wirlesdon into a cabaret. She behaved like a
  man-eating shark, and swept every male, except Tom Nantley, Folliot, and
  myself, into her retinue. They danced in the library, because of its polished
  empty floor, and when I looked in I saw that the kind of dances were not what
  I should have chosen for youth, and was glad that Pam and Dolly had been sent
  to bed. I heard a clear voice declaring that it was "devilish slow," and I
  knew to whom the voice belonged. At the door I passed old Folliot on his way
  to his room, and he shook his head and murmured "Common." This time I almost
  agreed with him.</p>

  <p>In the drawing-room I found my hostess skimming the weekly press, and drew
  up a chair beside her. Mollie Nantley and I count cousinship, though the
  relation is slightly more remote, and she has long been my very good friend.
  She laid down her paper and prepared to talk.</p>

  <p>"I was so glad to see Colonel Milburne again. He looks so well too. But,
  Ned dear, you ought to get him to go about more, for he's really a little
  old-maidish. He was scared to death by Corrie Arabin."</p>

  <p>"Well, isn't she rather&mdash;shall we say disconcerting? More by token,
  who is she?"</p>

  <p>"Poor little Corrie! She's the only child of a rather horrible man who
  died last year&mdash;Shelley Arabin. Did you never hear of him? He married a
  sort of cousin of mine and treated her shamefully. Corrie had the most
  miserable upbringing&mdash; somewhere in Greece, you know, and in Rome and
  Paris, and at the worst kind of girls' school where they teach the children
  to be snobs and powder their noses and go to confession. The school wouldn't
  have mattered, for the Arabins are Romans, and Corrie couldn't be a snob if
  she tried, but her home life would have ruined St. Theresa. She was in London
  last summer with the Ertzbergers, and I was rather unhappy about her living
  among cosmopolitan Jew <i>rastaquou&egrave;res,</i> so I am trying to do what
  I can for her this winter. Fortunately she has taken madly to hunting, and
  she goes most beautifully. She has never had a chance, poor child. You must
  be kind to her, Ned."</p>

  <p>I said that I was not in the habit of being brutal to young women, but
  that she was not likely to want my kindness. "She seems to be a success in
  her way. These boys follow her like sheep."</p>

  <p>"Oh, she has had one kind of success, but not the best kind. She casts an
  extraordinary spell over young men, and does not care a straw for one of
  them. I might be nervous about Hugo, but I'm not in the least, for she is
  utterly sexless&mdash;more like a wild boy. It is no good trying to improve
  her manners, for she is quite unconscious of them. I don't think there is an
  atom of harm in her, and she has delightful things about her&mdash; she is
  charming to Pam and Dolly, and they adore her, and she is simply the most
  honest creature ever born. She must get it from her mother, for Shelley was
  an infamous liar."</p>

  <p>Mollie's comely face, with her glorious golden-red hair slightly greying
  at the temples, had a look of compassionate motherliness. With all her
  vagueness, she is one of the shrewdest women of my acquaintance, and I have a
  deep respect for her judgment. If she let her adored Pam and Dolly make
  friends of Miss Arabin, Miss Arabin must be something more than the cabaret
  girl of my first impression.</p>

  <p>"But I'm not happy about her," Mollie went on. "I can't see her future.
  She ought to marry, and the odds are terribly against her marrying the right
  man. Boys flock after her, but the really nice men&mdash;like Colonel
  Milburne&mdash;fly from her like the plague. They don't understand that her
  bad form is not our bad form, but simply foreignness...  And she's so
  terribly strong-minded. I know that she hates everything connected with her
  early life, and yet she insists on going back to that Greek place. Her father
  left her quite well off, I believe&mdash;Tom says so, and he has looked into
  her affairs&mdash;and she ought to settle down here and acclimatize herself.
  All her superficial oddities would soon drop off, for she is so clever she
  could make herself whatever she wanted. It is what she wants, too, for she
  loves England and English ways. But there is a touch of 'daftness' about her,
  a kind of freakishness which I can never understand. I suppose it is the
  Arabin blood."</p>

  <p>Mollie sighed.</p>

  <p>"I try to be tolerant about youth," she added, "but I sometimes long to
  box its ears. Besides, there is the difficulty about the others. I am quite
  sure of Corrie up to a point, but I can't be responsible for the young men.
  George Cheviot shows every inclination to make a fool of himself about her,
  and what am I to say to his mother? Really, having Corrie in the house is
  like domesticating a destroying angel."</p>

  <p>"You're the kindest of women," I said, "but I think you've taken on a job
  too hard for you. You can't mix oil and wine. You'll never fit Miss Arabin
  into your world. She belongs to a different one."</p>

  <p>"I wonder what it is?"</p>

  <p>"A few hours ago I should have said it was the world of cabarets and
  Riviera hotels and Ertzbergers. After what you have told me I'm not so sure.
  But anyhow it's not our world."</p>

  <p>As I went to bed I heard the jigging of dance music from the library, and
  even in so large a house as Wirlesdon its echoes seemed to pursue me as I
  dropped into sleep. The result was that I had remarkable dreams, in which
  Miss Arabin, dressed in the spangles of a circus performer and riding a
  piebald horse, insisted on my piloting her with the Mivern, while the Master
  and Vernon looked on in stony disapproval.</p>

  <p>The next morning was frosty and clear, and I came down to breakfast to
  find my hostess alone in the dining-room.</p>

  <p>"Corrie behaved disgracefully last night," I was informed. "She started
  some silly rag with George Cheviot, and made hay of Mr. Harcus's bedroom. Tom
  had to get up and read the Riot Act in the small hours. I have been to her
  room and found her asleep, but as soon as she wakes I am going to talk to her
  very seriously. It is more than bad manners&mdash;it is an offence against
  hospitality."</p>

  <p>I went to church with Tom and his daughters, and when we returned we found
  Miss Arabin breakfasting before the hall fire on grapes and coffee, with the
  usual young men in attendance. If she had been given a lecture by her
  hostess, there was no sign of it in her face. She looked amazingly
  brilliant&mdash;all in brown, with a jumper of brown arabesque and long amber
  ear-rings. A russet silk glove clothed the hand in which she held her
  cigarette.</p>

  <p>Vernon came over to luncheon and sat next to Mollie, while at the other
  end of the table I was placed between Miss Arabin and Lady Altrincham. The
  girl scarcely threw a word to me, being occupied in discussing, quite
  intelligently, with Hugo Brune the international position of Turkey. I could
  not avoid overhearing some of their talk, and I realized that when she chose
  she could behave like a civilized being. It might be that Mollie's morning
  discourse had borne fruit. Her voice was delightful to listen to, with its
  full, clear tones and delicate modulations. And then, after her habit, her
  attention wandered, and Hugo's platitudes fell on unheeding ears. She was
  staring at a picture of a Jacobean Nantley on the wall, and presently her
  eyes moved up the table and rested on Vernon.</p>

  <p>She spoke to me at last.</p>

  <p>"Who is the man next to Mollie&mdash;the man who came to tea last night?
  You know him, don't you?"</p>

  <p>I told her his name.</p>

  <p>"A soldier?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Has been. Does nothing at present. He has a place in Westmorland."</p>

  <p>"You are friends?"</p>

  <p>"The closest." There was something about the girl's brusqueness which made
  me want to answer in monosyllables. Then she suddenly took my breath
  away.</p>

  <p>"He is unhappy," she said. "He looks as if he had lost his way."</p>

  <p>She turned to Hugo and, with an urbanity which I had thought impossible,
  apologized for her inattention, and took up the conversation at the point at
  which she had dropped it.</p>

  <p>Her words made me keep my eyes on Vernon. Unhappy! There was little sign
  of it in his lean smiling face, with the tanned cheeks and steady eyes.
  Mollie was clearly delighted with him; perhaps her maternal heart had marked
  him down for Dolly. Lost his way? On the contrary he seemed at complete ease
  with the world. Was this strange girl a sorceress to discover what was hidden
  deep in only two men's minds? I had a sense that Vernon and Miss Arabin, with
  nothing on earth in common, had yet a certain affinity. Each had a strain of
  romance in them&mdash; romance and the unpredictable.</p>

  <p>Vernon had motored over to Wirlesdon and proposed to walk back, so I
  accompanied him for part of the road. I was glad of a chance for a talk, for
  I was miserably conscious that we were slipping away from each other. I
  didn't see how I could help it, for I was immersed in practical affairs,
  while he would persist in living for a dream. Before the war I had been half
  under the spell of that dream, but four years' campaigning had given me a
  distaste for the fantastic and set my feet very solidly on the rock of facts.
  Our two circles of comprehension, which used to intersect, had now become
  self-contained.</p>

  <p>I asked him what he was doing with himself, and he said hunting, and
  shooting, and dabbling in books. He was writing something&mdash;I think about
  primitive Greek religion, in consequence of some notions he had picked up
  during his service in the Aegean.</p>

  <p>"Seriously, old fellow," I said, "isn't it time you settled down to
  business? You are twenty-five, you have first-class brains, and you are quite
  fit now. I can't have you turning into a <i>fl&acirc;neur</i>."</p>

  <p>"There is no fear of that," he replied rather coldly. "I am eager for
  work, but I haven't found it yet. My training isn't finished. I must wait
  till after next April."</p>

  <p>"But what is going to happen after that?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. I must see what happens <i>then</i>."</p>

  <p>"Vernon," I cried, "we are old friends, and I am going to speak bluntly.
  You really must face up to facts. What is going to happen next April? What
  <i>can</i> happen? Put it at its highest. You may pass through some strange
  mental experience. I can't conceive what it may be, but suppose the last door
  does open and you see something strange and beautiful or even terrible&mdash;
  I don't know what. It will all happen inside your mind. It will round off the
  recurring experiences you have had from childhood, but it can't do anything
  more."</p>

  <p>"It will do much more," he said. "It will be the crisis of my life...  Why
  have you become so sceptical, Ned? You used to think as I do about it."</p>

  <p>"It will only be a crisis if you make it so, and it's too risky.
  Supposing, on the other hand, that nothing happens. You will have keyed your
  whole being up to an expectation which fails. You will be derelict, cut clean
  from your moorings. It's too risky, I tell you."</p>

  <p>He shook his head. "We have fallen out of understanding each other. Your
  second alternative is impossible. I know it in my bones. Something will
  happen&mdash;must happen&mdash;and then I shall know what I have to do with
  my life. It will be the pistol-shot for the start."</p>

  <p>"But, my dear old man, think of the hazard. You are staking everything on
  a wild chance. Heaven knows, I'm not unsympathetic. I believe in you&mdash;I
  believe in a way in the reality of the dream. But life is a prosaic thing,
  and if you are to have marvels in it you should take them in your stride. I
  want to see you with some sort of policy for the future, and letting the last
  stage of your dream drop in naturally into a strategic plan. You can't, at
  twenty-six, sit waiting on a revelation. You must shape your own course, and
  take the revelation when it comes. If you don't, you'll find yourself
  derelict. Damn it, you're far too good to be a waif."</p>

  <p>He smiled a little sadly. "We're pretty far apart now, I'm afraid. Can't
  you see that the thing is too big a part of me to be treated as a side-show?
  It's what I've been sent into the world for. I'm waiting for my marching
  orders."</p>

  <p>"Then you're waiting for a miracle," I said testily.</p>

  <p>"True. I am waiting for a miracle," he replied. "We needn't argue about
  it, Ned, for miracles are outside argument. In less than six months I will
  know. Till then I am content to live by faith."</p>

  <p>After leaving him, I walked back to the house in an uncomfortable frame of
  mind. I realized that the affection between us was as deep as ever, but I had
  a guilty sense of having left him in the lurch. He was alone now, whereas
  once I had been with him, and I hated to think of his loneliness.</p>

  <p>As I crossed the bridge between the lakes I met Miss Arabin sauntering
  bareheaded in the autumn sunlight. I would have passed on, with a curt
  greeting, for I was in no mood to talk trivialities to a girl I disliked, but
  to my surprise she stopped and turned with me up the long grassy aisle which
  led to the gardens.</p>

  <p>"I came out to meet you," she said. "I want to talk to you."</p>

  <p>My response cannot have been encouraging, but she took no notice of
  that.</p>

  <p>"You're a lawyer, aren't you?" she went on. "Mollie says you are very
  clever. You look clever."</p>

  <p>I daresay I grinned. I was being comprehensively patronized.</p>

  <p>"Well, I want you to help me. I have some tiresome legal complications to
  disentangle, and my solicitor is a sheep. I mean to sack him."</p>

  <p>I explained the etiquette of my profession.</p>

  <p>"Oh, then you can tell him what to do. You'll understand his silly talk,
  which I don't. You make him obey you."</p>

  <p>"My dear young lady," I said, "I cannot undertake private business. You
  see I'm in the employ of the Government."</p>

  <p>"Don't be afraid, I can pay you all right." The words were too na&iuml;ve
  to be insulting.</p>

  <p>I said nothing, and she darted before me and looked me in the face.</p>

  <p>"You mean that you won't help me?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I mean that I'm not allowed," I replied. Without another word she swung
  round and disappeared up a side glade. As she vanished among the beech trees,
  a figure as russet as the drift of leaves, I thought I had never seen
  anything more quick and slender, and I fervently hoped that I should never
  see her again.</p><br>
 <br>

  <h2><a name="chap5"
     id="chap5">CHAPTER 5</a></h2>

  <p>In that hope I was mistaken. A fortnight later the Treasury Solicitor sent
  me the papers in one of those intricate international cases which were the
  debris of the war. It was a claim by a resident abroad, who had not lost his
  British nationality, for compensation for some oppressive act of one of the
  transient Greek Governments. I left the thing to my "devil," and just skimmed
  his note before the necessary conference with the plaintiff's solicitors. To
  my surprise I saw that it had to do with the island of Plakos and the name of
  Arabin.</p>

  <p>Mr. Mower, of the reputable firm of Mower and Lidderdale, was not unlike a
  sheep in appearance&mdash;a Leicester ewe for choice. He had a large pale
  high-boned face, rimless spectacles, a crop of nice fleecy white hair, and
  the bedside manner of the good family solicitor. My hasty study of the papers
  showed me that the oppressive acts were not denied, but that the title of the
  plaintiff was questioned.</p>

  <p>"This is a matter of domestic law," I said&mdash;"the <i>lex loci rei
  sitae</i>. If the title to the land is disputed, it is a case for the Greek
  courts."</p>

  <p>"We have reason to believe that the defence is not seriously put forward,
  for the title is beyond dispute, and we are at a loss to understand the
  attitude of the Greek Government. The documents are all in our possession,
  and we took Mr. Blakeney's advice on them. His opinion is among the papers
  left with you&mdash;and you will see that he has no doubt on the matter."</p>

  <p>Mr. Blakeney certainly had not, as I saw from his opinion, nor had my
  "devil." The latter characterized the defence as "monstrous." It seemed to be
  based on an arbitrary act of the old Greek National Assembly of 1830. My note
  said that the title was complete in every respect, and that the attempt to
  question it seemed to be a species of insanity. A name caught my
  attention.</p>

  <p>"What is Kor&eacute;?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"It is Miss Arabin's Christian name. Greek, I presume," said Mr. Mower,
  very much in the tone in which Mr. Pecksniff observed, "Pagan, I regret to
  say."</p>

  <p>I read the note again, and Blakeney's opinion. Blakeney was an authority
  from whom I was not disposed to differ, and the facts seemed too patent for
  argument. As I turned over the papers I saw the name of another solicitor on
  them.</p>

  <p>"You have not always acted for the Arabin family?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Only within the last few months. Derwents were the family solicitors, but
  Miss Arabin was dissatisfied with them and withdrew her business. Curiously
  enough, they advised that the claim of the Greek Government was good, and
  should not be opposed."</p>

  <p>"What!" I exclaimed. Derwents are one of the best firms in England, and
  the senior partner, Sebastian Derwent, was my oldest client. He was not only
  a sound lawyer, but a good scholar and a good fellow. What on earth had
  induced him to give such paradoxical advice?</p>

  <p>I told Mr. Mower that the matter seemed plain enough, but that for my own
  satisfaction I proposed to give further consideration to the papers. I took
  them home with me that evening, and the more I studied them the less I could
  understand Derwent's action. The thing seemed a bluff so impudent as to be
  beyond argument. The abstract of title was explicit enough, and Blakeney, who
  had had the original documents, was emphatic on the point. But the firm of
  Derwents was not in the habit of acting without good cause...  I found myself
  becoming interested in the affair. Plakos was still a disquieting memory, and
  the outrageous girl at Wirlesdon was of a piece with its strangeness.</p>

  <p>A day or two later I was dining at the Athenaeum before going down to the
  House, and I saw Sebastian Derwent eating a solitary meal at an adjacent
  table. I moved over beside him, and after some casual conversation I ventured
  to sound him on the subject. With another man it might have been a delicate
  task, but we were old and confidential friends.</p>

  <p>I told him I had had the Plakos case before me. "You used to act for the
  Arabins?" I said.</p>

  <p>He nodded, and a slight embarrassment entered his manner. "My father and
  grandfather, too, before me. The firm had a difficult time with old Tom
  Arabin. He had a habit of coming down to the office with a horsewhip, and on
  one occasion my grandfather was compelled to wrest it from him, break it over
  his knee, and pitch it into the fire."</p>

  <p>"I can imagine easier clients. But I am puzzled about that preposterous
  Greek claim. I can't think how it came to be raised, for it is sheer
  bluff."</p>

  <p>He reddened a little, and crumbled his bread.</p>

  <p>"I advised Miss Arabin not to dispute it," he said.</p>

  <p>"I know, and I can't imagine why. You advised her to sit down under a
  piece of infamous extortion."</p>

  <p>"I advised her to settle it."</p>

  <p>"But how can you settle a dispute when all the rights are on one side? Do
  you maintain that there was any law or equity in the Greek case?"</p>

  <p>He hesitated for a second. "No," he said, "the claim was bad in law. But
  its acceptance would have had certain advantages for Miss Arabin."</p>

  <p>I suppose I looked dumbfounded. "It's a long story," he said, "and I'm not
  sure that I have the right to tell it to you."</p>

  <p>"Let us leave it at that, then. Of course it's no business of mine." I did
  not want to embarrass an old friend.</p>

  <p>But he seemed disinclined to leave it. "You think I have acted
  unprofessionally?" he ventured.</p>

  <p>"God forbid! I know you too well, and I don't want to poke my nose into
  private affairs."</p>

  <p>"I can tell you this much. Miss Arabin is in a position of extreme
  difficulty. She is alone in the world, without a near relation. She is very
  young, and not quite the person to manage a troublesome estate."</p>

  <p>"But surely that is no reason why she should surrender her patrimony to a
  bogus demand?"</p>

  <p>"It would not have been exactly surrender. I advised her not to submit but
  to settle. Full compensation would have been paid if she had given up
  Plakos."</p>

  <p>"Oh, come now," I cried. "Who ever heard of voluntary compensation being
  paid by a little stony-broke Government in Eastern Europe?"</p>

  <p>"It would have been arranged," he said. "Miss Arabin had friends&mdash;a
  friend&mdash;who had great influence. The compensation was privately settled,
  and it was on a generous scale. Miss Arabin has fortunately other sources of
  income than Plakos: indeed, I do not think she draws any serious revenue from
  the island. She would have received a sum of money in payment, the interest
  on which would have added substantially to her income."</p>

  <p>"But I still don't see the motive. If the lady is not worried about money,
  why should her friends be so anxious to increase her income?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Derwent shook his head. "Money is not the motive. The fact is that
  Plakos is a troublesome property. The Arabin family have never been popular,
  and the inhabitants are turbulent and barely civilized. The thing is weighing
  on her mind. It is not the sort of possession for a young girl."</p>

  <p>"I see. In order to rid Miss Arabin of a <i>damnosa haereditas</i> you
  entered into a friendly conspiracy. I gather that she saw through it."</p>

  <p>He nodded. "She is very quick-witted, and was furious at the questioning
  of her title. That was my mistake. I underrated her intelligence. I should
  have had the thing more ingeniously framed. I can assure you that my last
  interview with her was very painful. I was forced to admit the thinness of
  the Greek claim, and after that I had a taste of Tom Arabin's temper. She is
  an extraordinary child, but there is wonderful quality in her, wonderful
  courage. I confess I am thankful as a lawyer to be rid of her affairs, but as
  a friend of the family I cannot help being anxious...  She is so terribly
  alone in the world."</p>

  <p>"That is a queer story," I said. "Of course you behaved as I should have
  expected, but I fancy that paternal kindliness is thrown away on that young
  woman. I met her a few weeks ago in a country house, and she struck me as
  peculiarly able to look after herself. One last question. Who is the friend
  who is so all-powerful at Athens?"</p>

  <p>"That I fear I am not at liberty to tell you," was the answer.</p>

  <p>This tale whetted my curiosity. From old Folliot I had learned something
  of the record of the Arabins, and I had my own impression of Plakos as clear
  as a cameo. Now I had further details in my picture. Kor&eacute; Arabin (odd
  name! I remembered from my distant schooldays that Kor&eacute; was Greek for
  a "maiden"&mdash;it had nothing to do with Corisande of the circus) was the
  mistress of that sinister island and that brooding house of a people who
  detested her race. There was danger in the place, danger so great that some
  friend unknown was prepared to pay a large price to get her out of it, and
  had involved in the plot the most decorous solicitor in England. Who was this
  friend? I wanted to meet him and to hear more of Plakos, for I realized that
  he and not Derwent was the authority.</p>

  <p>Speculation as to his identity occupied a good deal of my leisure, till
  suddenly I remembered what Lady Nantley had told me. Miss Arabin had been
  living in London with the Ertzbergers before she came to Wirlesdon. The
  friend could only be Theodore Ertzberger. He had endless Greek connections,
  was one of the chief supporters of Venizelos, and it was through his house
  that the new Greek loan was to be issued. I had met him, of course, and my
  recollection was of a small bright-eyed man with a peaked grey beard and the
  self-contained manner of the high financier. I had liked him, and found
  nothing of the <i>rastaquou&egrave;re</i> in him to which Mollie objected.
  His wife as another matter. She was a large, flamboyant Belgian Jewess, a
  determined social climber, and a great patron of art and music, who ran a
  salon, and whose portraits were to be found in every exhibition of the young
  school of painters. It was borne in on me that my curiosity would not be
  satisfied till I had had a talk with Ertzberger.</p>

  <p>Lady Amysfort arranged the meeting at a Sunday luncheon, when Madame
  Ertzberger was mercifully stricken with influenza.</p>

  <p>Except for the hostess, it was a man's party, and afterwards she
  manoeuvred that Ertzberger and I should be left alone in a corner of the big
  drawing-room.</p>

  <p>I did not waste time beating about the bush, for I judged from his face
  that this man would appreciate plain dealing. There was something simple and
  fine about his small regular features and the steady regard of his dark
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"I am glad to have this chance of a talk with you," I said. "I have lately
  been consulted about Plakos, and Miss Arabin's claim against the Greek
  Government. Also, a few weeks ago, I had the pleasure of meeting Miss Arabin.
  The whole business interests me strongly&mdash;not as a lawyer but as a human
  being. You see, just before the war I happened to visit Plakos, and I can't
  quite get the place out of my head. You are a friend of hers, and I should
  like to know something more about the island. I gather that it's not the most
  comfortable kind of estate."</p>

  <p>He looked me straight in the face. "I think you know Mr. Sebastian
  Derwent," he said.</p>

  <p>"I do. And he gave me a hint of Miss Arabin's difficulties, and the
  solution proposed. His conduct may not have been strictly professional, but
  it was extraordinarily kind. But let me make it quite clear that he never
  mentioned your name, or gave me any sort of clue to it. I guessed that you
  were the friend, because I knew that Miss Arabin had been staying in your
  house."</p>

  <p>"You guessed rightly. It is not a thing that I naturally want made public,
  but I am not in the least ashamed of the part I played. I welcome the
  opportunity of discussing it with you. It is a curious thing, but Miss Arabin
  has already spoken of you to me."</p>

  <p>"She asked me to advise her, and I'm afraid was rather annoyed when I told
  her that I couldn't take private practice."</p>

  <p>"But she has not given up the notion. She never gives up any notion. She
  has somehow acquired a strong belief in your wisdom."</p>

  <p>"I am obliged to her, but I am not in a position to help."</p>

  <p>He laid his hand on my arm. "Do not refuse her," he said earnestly.
  "Believe me, no woman ever stood in more desperate need of friends."</p>

  <p>His seriousness impressed me. "She has a loyal one in you, at any rate.
  And she seems to be popular, and to have a retinue of young men."</p>

  <p>He looked at me sharply. "You think she is a light-headed girl, devoted to
  pleasure&mdash;rather second-rate pleasure&mdash;a little ill-bred perhaps.
  But you are wrong, Sir Edward. Here in England she is a
  butterfly&mdash;dancing till all hours, a madcap in town and in the
  hunting-field, a bewitcher of foolish boys. Oh, bad form, I grant
  you&mdash;the worst of bad form. But that is because she comes here for an
  anodyne. She is feverishly gay because she is trying to forget&mdash;trying
  not to remember that there is tragedy waiting behind her."</p>

  <p>"Where?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"In the island of Plakos."</p>

  <p>Tragedy&mdash;that was the word he used. It had an incongruous sound to
  me, sitting in a warm London drawing-room after an excellent luncheon, with
  the sound of chatter and light laughter coming from the group around my
  hostess. But he had meant it&mdash;his grave voice and burdened face showed
  it&mdash;and the four walls seemed to fade into another picture&mdash;a
  twilight by a spring sea, and under a shadowy house two men with uplifted
  hands and hate and fear in their eyes.</p>

  <p>"If you will do me the honour to listen," Ertzberger was speaking, "I
  should like to tell you more about Miss Arabin's case."</p>

  <p>"Have you known her long?" I asked. A sudden disinclination had come over
  me to go further in this affair. I felt dimly that if I became the recipient
  of confidences I might find myself involved in some distasteful course of
  action.</p>

  <p>"Since she was a child. I had dealings with her father&mdash; business
  dealings&mdash;he was no friend of mine&mdash;but there was a time when I
  often visited Plakos. I can claim that I have known Miss Arabin for nearly
  fifteen years."</p>

  <p>"Her father was a bit of a blackguard?"</p>

  <p>"None of the words we use glibly to describe evil are quite adequate to
  Shelley Arabin. The man was rotten to the very core. His father&mdash;I
  remember him too&mdash;was unscrupulous and violent, but he had a heart. And
  he had a kind of burning courage. Shelley was as hard and cold as a stone,
  and he was also a coward. But he had genius&mdash;a genius for wickedness. He
  was beyond all comparison the worst man I have ever known."</p>

  <p>"What did he do?" I asked. "I should have thought the opportunities for
  wrong-doing in a remote island were limited."</p>

  <p>"He was a student of evil. He had excellent brains and much learning, and
  he devoted it all to researches in devilry. He had his friends&mdash;people
  of his own tastes, who acknowledged him as their master. Some of the
  gatherings at Plakos would have made Nero vomit. Men and women both...  The
  place stank of corruption. I have only heard the orgies hinted at&mdash;
  heathenish remnants from the backstairs of the Middle Ages. And on the
  fringes of that hell the poor child grew up."</p>

  <p>"Unsmirched?"</p>

  <p>"Unsmirched! I will stake my soul on that. A Muse, a Grace, a nymph among
  satyrs. Her innocence kept her from understanding. And then as she grew older
  and began to have an inkling of horrors, she was in flaming revolt...  I
  managed to get her sent away, first to school, then to my wife's charge.
  Otherwise I think there would have been a tragedy."</p>

  <p>"But surely with her father's death the danger is gone."</p>

  <p>He shook his head. "Plakos is a strange place, for the tides of
  civilization and progress seem to have left it high and dry. It is a relic of
  old days, full of wild beliefs and pagan habits. That was why Shelley could
  work his will with it. He did not confine his evil-doing to his friends and
  the four walls of his house. He laid a spell of terror on the island. There
  are horrid tales&mdash;I won't trouble you with them&mdash;about his dealings
  with the peasants, for he revelled in corrupting youth. And terror grew soon
  into hate, till in his last days the man's nerve broke. He lived his last
  months in gibbering fear. There is something to be said after all for
  mediaeval methods. Shelley was the kind of scoundrel whom an outraged people
  should have treated with boiling oil."</p>

  <p>"Does the hatred pursue his daughter?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Most certainly. It took years for Plakos to recognize Shelley's
  enormities, and now the realization has become cumulative, growing with every
  month. I have had inquiries made&mdash;it is easy for me since I have agents
  everywhere in the Aegean&mdash;and I can tell you the thing has become a
  mania. The war brought the island pretty near starvation, for the fishing was
  crippled and a succession of bad seasons spoiled the wretched crops. Also
  there was a deadly epidemic of influenza. Well, the unsettlement of men's
  minds, which is found all over the world to-day, has become in Plakos sheer
  madness. Remember, the people are primitive, and have savagery in their blood
  and odd faiths in their hearts. I do not know much about these things, but
  scholars have told me that in the islands the old gods are not altogether
  dead. The people have suffered, and they blame their sufferings on the
  Arabins, till they have made a monstrous legend of it. Shelley is in hell and
  beyond their reach, but Shelley's daughter is there. She is the witch who has
  wronged them, and they are the kind of folk who are capable of
  witch-burning."</p>

  <p>"Good God!" I cried. "Then the girl ought never to be allowed to
  return."</p>

  <p>"So I thought, and hence my little conspiracy which failed. I may tell you
  in confidence that it was I who prompted the action of the Greek Government,
  and was prepared to find the compensation. But I was met by a stone wall. She
  insists on holding on to the place. Worse, she insists on going back. She
  went there last spring, and the spring is a perilous time, for the people
  have had the winter to brood over their hatred. I do not know whether she is
  fully conscious of the risk, for sometimes I think she is still only a child.
  But last year she was in very real danger, and she must have felt it. Behind
  all her bravado I could see that she was afraid."</p>

  <p>It was an odd tale to hear in a commonplace drawing-room, and it was odder
  to hear it from such a narrator. There was nothing romantic about Ertzberger.
  I daresay he had the imaginative quickness of his race, but the dominant
  impression was of solid good sense. He looked at the thing from a business
  man's point of view, and the cold facts made him shudder.</p>

  <p>"What on earth is her reason?" I asked. "Has she any affection for
  Plakos?"</p>

  <p>"She hates it. But there is some stubborn point of honour which forbids
  her to let it go. She has her grandfather's fierce obstinacy. Fate has dared
  her to defend her own, and she has accepted the challenge...  It is not
  merely the sense of property. I think she feels that she has a
  duty&mdash;that she cannot run away from the consequences of her father's
  devilry. Her presence there at the mercy of the people is a kind of
  atonement."</p>

  <p>"Has she any friends in the island?"</p>

  <p>"An old steward is the only man in the house. She may have her
  well-wishers outside, but they cannot be many, for she has not lived
  continuously there for years. Last spring I tried to have her guarded, but
  she saw through my plan and forbade it. All I could do was to have the place
  watched on my own account. This winter my information is that things are
  worse. There is famine in the hills, and the hillmen are looking with jealous
  eyes towards the house by the sea. The stories grow wilder, too."</p>

  <p>"What kind?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, witchcraft. That the Arabins are sorcerers, and that she herself is a
  witch. Every misfortune in the island is laid to her account. God knows what
  may happen this spring, if she persists in going back! My hope was that she
  might find some lover who would make her forget the obsession, but on the
  contrary the obsession has made her blind to lovers. Perhaps you have noticed
  it...  She seems to flirt outrageously, but she keeps every man at a distance
 ...  Now, do you understand Miss Arabin a little better?"</p>

  <p>I was beginning to. A picture was growing up in my mind of something
  infinitely pathetic, and terribly alone. A child terrified by a nightmare
  life which she did not understand&mdash;carried off to a new environment from
  which she extracted what was most feverish and vulgar, for she had no canons,
  yet keeping through it all a pitiful innocence&mdash;returning to a
  half-comprehension which revolted her soul&mdash;resolute to face the
  consequences of the past with an illogical gallantry. I did not know when I
  had heard a tale that so moved me.</p>

  <p>"You will not refuse her if she asks your help?" Ertzberger pleaded.</p>

  <p>"But what can I do?" I said. "I'm a lawyer, and she doesn't want legal
  advice, even if I were free to give it her."</p>

  <p>"She has got the notion that you can help her. Don't ask me why or how.
  Call it a girl's fancy and make the best of it. I cannot influence her,
  Derwent couldn't, but you may, because for some reason or other she believes
  that you are wise...  I think...  I think that she thinks that you can tell
  her what precisely she has to fear in Plakos. There is a mass of papers, you
  know."</p>

  <p>"What to fear!" I exclaimed. "Surely you have just made that plain. A
  famished and half-civilized peasantry with a long record of ill treatment.
  Isn't that enough?"</p>

  <p>"There may be something more," Ertzberger said slowly. "She has an idea
  that there is something more...  and she is terrified of that something. If
  you can get rid of her terrors you will be doing a humane act, Sir Edward.
  The trouble, as I have told you, is that she will take so few into her
  confidence."</p>

  <p>"Look here, Mr. Ertzberger," I said. "I will be quite frank with you. Miss
  Arabin did not attract me&mdash;indeed I have not often been more repelled by
  a young woman. But what you have said puts a new complexion on her behaviour.
  Tell her I am willing to do my best for her, to advise her, to help her in
  any way I can. But if she wouldn't listen to you, you may be certain she
  won't listen to me."</p>

  <p>"That's very good of you," he said, rising. "She proposes to go to Plakos
  in March. Pray God we can put some sanity into her in the next three
  months."</p><br>
 <br>

  <h2><a name="chap6"
     id="chap6">CHAPTER 6</a></h2>

  <p>Two days later I had to go north by an early train from Euston, and
  opposite my platform a special was waiting to take a hunting party down to
  somewhere in the Shires. Around the doors of the carriages stood a number of
  expensive-looking young people, among whom I recognized Miss Arabin. She wore
  a long fur coat, and sniffed at a bunch of violets, while in her high, clear
  voice she exchanged badinage with two young men. As she stood with one foot
  on the carriage step, her small head tilted backward, her red lips parted in
  laughter, it was hard to connect her with the stricken lady of Ertzberger's
  story. Just as the special was leaving, I saw Vernon hurry up, also in
  hunting-kit. He cast one glance at Miss Arabin, and found a seat in another
  carriage. I hoped the Pytchley would have a fast day, for I did not see these
  two fraternizing during waits at covert-side.</p>

  <p>Curiously enough I saw the girl again the same week, also in a railway
  train. I was returning from Liverpool, and our trains halted beside each
  other at Rugby. She was alone in her carriage, the winter dusk was falling,
  but the lights were not yet lit, and I saw her only faintly, silhouetted
  against the farther window. She was not asleep, but her head was sunk as if
  in a dream. In the few seconds during which I watched I had a strong
  impression of loneliness, almost of dejection. She was alone with her
  thoughts, and they were heavy.</p>

  <p>That evening, on my return to my flat, I found a big parcel of papers.
  Characteristically there was no covering letter or identification of any
  sort, but a glance showed me what they were. My time after dinner that night
  was at my own disposal, and I devoted it to reading them. I believe I would
  have put aside work of whatever urgency for that purpose, for Plakos had
  begun to dominate my thoughts.</p>

  <p>The papers were a curious jumble&mdash;no legal documents, but a mass of
  family archives and notes on the island. I observed that there was nothing
  concerned with Shelley. Most of the things had to do with old Tom
  Arabin&mdash;correspondence, original and copied, which had passed between
  him and his friends or enemies. There were letters from Byron and Shelley and
  Trelawny, one from no less a person than Sir Walter Scott, many from John Cam
  Hobhouse, official dispatches from the British Foreign Office, a formal note
  or two from Castlereagh, and several long and interesting epistles from
  Canning, who seemed to have had some friendship for the old fellow. There was
  a quantity, too, of correspondence with Continental statesmen, and I observed
  several famous names. All this I put on one side, for it did not concern my
  purpose.</p>

  <p>Then there was old Tom Arabia's diary, which I skimmed. It was a very
  human and explosive document, but there was little about Plakos in it. Tom
  was more interested in the high politics of Europe than in the little domain
  he had acquired. Next I turned up a manuscript history of the island in
  French, written apparently about 1860 by a Greek of the name of Karapanos.
  This was a dull work, being merely a summary of the island's record under
  Venetian and Turkish rule, and the doings of its people in the War of
  Liberation. Then came a bundle of early nineteenth-century maps and charts,
  and some notes on olive culture. There was a batch, too, of verses in Greek
  and English, probably Tom's work and not very good. There was a pedigree of
  the Arabin family in the old Irtling days, and a great deal more junk which
  had not even an antiquarian interest. I shoved away the papers with a sense
  of failure. There was nothing here to throw light on Plakos; if such material
  existed it must have been in Shelley's papers, of which his daughter had
  doubtless made a bonfire.</p>

  <p>Then I noticed something among the notes on olive culture, and drew out a
  thick, old-fashioned envelope heavily sealed with green wax, which bore the
  Arabin device of a Turk's head. I opened it and extracted a sheet of
  yellowish parchment, covered closely with Greek characters. I was taught
  Greek at school, though I have forgotten most of it, but I never professed to
  be able to read even the printed Greek of the fifteenth and sixteenth
  centuries. This document seemed to be of that date, and its insane ligatures
  and contractions completely defeated me. But there might be something in
  these hieroglyphics, so I bundled up the rest of the papers and locked the
  envelope in a dispatch box.</p>

  <p>Next day I paid a visit to a Chancery barrister of my acquaintance whose
  hobby was mediaeval Greek, and who had written a monograph on Aldus Manutius.
  He examined the thing with delight, pronounced the calligraphy fifteenth
  century, and promised to write out the contents for me in decent Greek
  script.</p>

  <p>It was not till early in the New Year that I got the manuscript back from
  him. The task, he said, had been very difficult, and though he was pretty
  certain that he had got the transliteration correct, he did not profess to be
  able to construe it. "I'm a typographer," he wrote, "not a scholar. The
  thing, too, is obviously corrupt, and I should call it the work of an
  uneducated man who copied what he did not understand. But it is very curious.
  It seems to be an account of a place called Kynaetho. Better show it
  to&mdash;" and he mentioned several names.</p>

  <p>I did not happen to know any of the people he cited, and it occurred to me
  that I might consult Vernon. He was, I knew, a fine scholar, and he had kept
  up his interest in Greek literature. So I sent the original and the modern
  version to him, saying that the document had come into my hands
  professionally and I should like to know if he could make anything of it.</p>

  <p>Next day I had Vernon on the telephone and he seemed to be excited. "Where
  on earth did you pick up that thing?" he asked. "I suppose it isn't a
  fake?"</p>

  <p>"Genuine enough," I replied, "but I can't tell you its story yet. Can you
  make sense of it?"</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't say exactly 'sense,' but I can translate it after a fashion. I
  worked at it last night till the small hours. If I knew the <i>provenance</i>
  of the manuscript, I might be able to understand it better. Come and dine
  to-night, and we'll talk about it."</p>

  <p>Vernon had taken a flat in Cleveland Row, and it was a proof of our
  gradual estrangement that till that evening I had never been inside its
  doors. Indeed we had not met since that Sunday at Wirlesdon.</p>

  <p>"I saw you at Euston one morning before Christmas," I said. "Miss Arabin
  was going to hunt in the same train."</p>

  <p>"Miss Arabin?" he puzzled. "I don't think I know&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"The queer girl who was at Wirlesdon."</p>

  <p>"Is that her name? I didn't know it. She rides well, but her manners are
  atrocious. Lord, how I dislike these <i>d&eacute;racin&eacute;s</i>! Let's
  get dinner over, for I've a lot to say to you about your jigsaw puzzle. It's
  extremely interesting, you know."</p>

  <p>Later in the evening he put before me several sheets of foolscap on which
  he had written the translation in his small beautiful hand.</p>

  <p>"The thing is headed <i>Ta Exotika,"</i> he said. "That puzzled me at
  first, till I remembered the phrase in Basil of Caesarea. It was the word
  used by the early Christians to describe the old divinities. Whoever wrote
  this&mdash;I don't mean the fifteenth-century scribe, but the original
  author&mdash;was no doubt a Christian, and he is describing a belief and a
  rite which existed in his time at a place called Kynaetho."</p>

  <p>"Where is that?"</p>

  <p>"I'm hanged if I know. It's a fairly common place name in Greece. There's
  one in Arcadia."</p>

  <p>I read his translation and could not make much of it. It reminded me of a
  schoolboy's version of a bit of Herodotus. "In Kynaetho," said the writer,
  "there is a custom at the Spring Festival of welcoming the Queen
  (<i>Despoina</i> was the word) with the rites of the tympanon and the kestos,
  such as they use in the Mysteries. There is a certain sacred place, a well
  beside a white cypress, from which all save the purified are excluded. In
  Kynaetho the Queen is known as Fairborn (Kalligenia). In winter the Queen is
  asleep, but she wakes in Spring, wherefore the Spring month is called by her
  name...  " After this came a fuller description of the rites and a lot of
  talk about "mantic birds."</p>

  <p>"There's nothing much in the first part," said Vernon. "It's the ordinary
  ceremony of the rebirth of Demeter. But notice that she is called 'Lady of
  the Wild Things.' There was a mighty unpleasant side to Demeter as well as an
  idyllic one, and it didn't do to take liberties with the Queen of the Shades.
  But read on."</p>

  <p>The writer went on to say that in time of great distress at Kynaetho there
  was a different ceremony. It then became necessary to invite not only the
  Mistress but the Master. For this purpose a virgin and a youth must be chosen
  and set apart in a hallowed place, and fed upon sacred food. The choosing was
  done by the victor in a race, who was given the name of King. Then on the
  appointed day, after the purification, when the dithyramb had been sung,
  Bromios would be born from Semele in the fire, and with him would come the
  Mistress. After that the place would be loved by the Gods, and corn, and oil,
  and wine would be multiplied.</p>

  <p>That was the gist of the story. The manuscript must have been imperfect,
  for there were gaps and some obvious nonsense, and there were fragments of
  verse quoted which I took to be part of the dithyramb. One ran like this:</p>

  <p class="poem">"Io, Kouros most great. I give thee hail.<br>
  Come, O Dithyrambos, Bromios come, and bring with thee<br>
  Holy hours of thy most holy Spring... <br>
  Then will be flung over earth immortal a garland of flowers,<br>
  Voices of song will rise among the pipes,<br>
  The Dancing Floor will be loud with the calling of crowned Semele."</p>

  <p>I laid the paper down. Vernon was watching me with bright eyes.</p>

  <p>"Do you see what it is? Some of those lines I recognize. They come from
  the Hymn of the Kouretes, which was discovered the other day in Crete, and
  from the Paean to Dionysos found at Delphi, and there is a fragment of Pindar
  in them too. We know Kor&eacute;, the Maiden, and we know the Kouros, who
  might be any male god&mdash;Dionysos or Zeus, or Apollo&mdash;but this is the
  only case I ever heard of where both Kor&eacute; and Kouros are found in the
  same ceremony. Kynaetho, wherever it was, must have fairly gone on the bust
 ...  It's amazingly interesting, and that's why I want to know the story of
  the manuscript. I tell you it's a find of the first importance to
  scholarship. Look at the other things too&mdash;the sacred race, and the
  winner called the King, just like the Basileus at the Olympic games.</p>

  <p>"And there's more," he went on. "Look at the passage about the hallowing
  of the maiden and the youth. How does it go?" He picked up the paper and
  read: "'Then the Consecrator shall set aside a youth and a virgin, who shall
  remain consecrate in a sanctity which for all others shall be a place
  unapproachable. For seven days they shall be fed with pure food, eggs, and
  cheese, and barley-cakes, and dried figs, and water from the well by the
  white cypress.' Do you see what that means? It was a human sacrifice. The
  fellow who wrote this skates lightly over the facts&mdash;I don't believe he
  was a Christian after all, or he wouldn't have taken it so calmly. The boy
  and the girl had to die before the Gods could be re-born. You see, it was a
  last resource&mdash;not an annual rite, but one reserved for a desperate
  need. All the words are ritual words&mdash;<i>horkos</i>, the sanctuary, and
  <i>abatos</i>, the tabu place, and <i>hosioter</i>, the consecrator. If we
  knew exactly what <i>hosiotheis</i> meant we should know a good deal about
  Greek religion. There were ugly patches in it. People try to gloss over the
  human sacrifice side, and of course civilized Greeks, like the Athenians,
  soon got rid of it; but I haven't a doubt the thing went on all through
  classical times in Thessaly, and Epirus, and Arcadia, and some of the
  islands. Indeed, in the islands it survived till almost the other day. There
  was a case not so long ago in Santorini."</p>

  <p>He pressed me to tell him the origin of the paper, but I felt reluctant to
  mention Miss Arabin. He was so deeply prejudiced against the girl, that it
  seemed unfair to reveal to him even the most trivial of her private affairs.
  I put him off by saying it was the property of a client, and that I would
  find out its history and tell him later.</p>

  <p>"I have made a copy of the Greek text," he said. "May I keep it?"</p>

  <p>I told him, certainly. And that was all that happened during the evening.
  Formerly we would have sat up talking and smoking till all hours, but now I
  felt that the curtain was too heavy between us to allow of ordinary
  conversation. We would get at once into difficult topics. Besides, I did not
  want to talk. The fact was that I was acquiring an obsession of my
  own&mdash;a tragic defiant girl moving between mirthless gaiety and menaced
  solitude. She might be innocent of the witchcraft in which Plakos believed,
  but she had cast some outlandish spell over me.</p>

  <p>Before the end of the week Miss Arabin rang me up.</p>

  <p>"You're Sir Edward Leithen? I sent you some papers. Have you looked at
  them?"</p>

  <p>I told her I had.</p>

  <p>"Then you had better come and talk to me. Come on Saturday and I'll give
  you luncheon. Half-past one."</p>

  <p>There was no word of thanks for my trouble, but I obeyed the summons as if
  it had been a royal command. She had taken a flat in a block off Berkeley
  Square, and I wondered what sort of environment she had made for herself. I
  think I expected a slovenly place full of cushions and French novels and
  hot-house flowers. Instead I found a large room wholly without
  frippery&mdash;a big bare writing-table, leather arm-chairs like a man's
  smoking-room, and on the walls one or two hunting prints and some
  water-colour sketches of English landscape. There were few books, and those I
  looked at were county history. It was a mild frosty day, and the windows were
  wide open. The only decorations were some dogwood branches and hedgerow
  berries&mdash;the spoil which townsfolk bring back in winter from country
  week-ends.</p>

  <p>She was in tweeds, for she was off to Wirlesdon that afternoon,
  and&mdash;perhaps in my honour&mdash;she had forborne to powder her face.
  Once again I was struck by the free vigour of her movements, and the quick
  vitality of her eyes. The cabaret atmosphere was clearly no part of the real
  woman; rather, as I now saw her, she seemed to carry with her a breath of the
  fields and hills.</p>

  <p>At luncheon we talked stiltedly of the Nantleys and hunting, but no sooner
  was coffee served than she came to business.</p>

  <p>"Theodore has told you about me? You see the kind of fence I'm up against.
  What I want to know is just exactly how high and thick it is, and that no one
  can tell me. I liked your looks the first time I saw you, and every one says
  you are clever. Now, understand one thing about me, I'm not going to show the
  white feather. Whatever it is, I'm going to stick it out. Have you that clear
  in your head?"</p>

  <p>As I looked at the firm little chin I believed her.</p>

  <p>"Well, can you enlighten me about the fence? You've heard all that
  Theodore has to say, and you know the cheerful sort of family I belong to.
  Did you find anything in the papers?"</p>

  <p>"You've read them yourself?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"I tried to, but I'm not clever, you see. I thought my grandfather's
  journal great nonsense. I had never heard of most of the names. But you're
  good at these things. Did you make nothing of them?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing." I ran over the items in the bundle, not mentioning the Greek
  manuscript, which seemed to me to have nothing to do with the subject. "But
  there must be other papers."</p>

  <p>She flushed slightly. "There were many others, but I burned them. Perhaps
  you can guess why."</p>

  <p>"Miss Arabin," I said, "I want to help you, but I don't think we need
  bother about the papers. Let's go back to the beginning. I suppose it's no
  use my urging you to get out of Plakos, settle in England, and wipe all the
  past out of your memory?"</p>

  <p>"Not the slightest."</p>

  <p>"I wonder why. After all, it's only common sense."</p>

  <p>"Common cowardice," she retorted, with a toss of her head. "I have known
  Theodore all my life, and I have forbidden him to raise that question. I have
  known you about a month, and I forbid <i>you</i>."</p>

  <p>There was something so flat-footed and final about her that I laughed. She
  stared at me haughtily for a moment, and then laughed also.</p>

  <p>"Go on with what you were saying," she said. "I stay at Plakos, and you
  must make your book for that. Now then."</p>

  <p>"Your family was unpopular&mdash;I understand, justly unpopular. All sorts
  of wild beliefs grew up about them among the peasants, and they have been
  transferred to you. The people are half savages, and half starved, and their
  mood is dangerous. They are coming to see in you the cause of their
  misfortunes. You go there alone and unprotected, and you have no friends in
  the island. The danger is that, after a winter of brooding, they may try in
  some horrible way to wreak their vengeance on you. That is what I learned
  from Mr. Ertzberger."</p>

  <p>The summary, as I made it, sounded unpleasant enough, but the girl did not
  seem to feel it so. She nodded briskly. "That, at any rate, is what Theodore
  says. He thinks they may make me a sacrifice. Stuff and nonsense, <i>I</i>
  say."</p>

  <p>The word "sacrifice" disquieted me. It reminded me of the Greek which
  Vernon had translated.</p>

  <p>"Some risk there must be," I went on, "but what I cannot tell is the exact
  moment of it. Even among a savage people unpopularity need not involve
  tragedy. You were in Plakos last spring. Tell me what happened."</p>

  <p>She fitted a cigarette into a long amber holder, and blew a cloud of smoke
  which she watched till it disappeared.</p>

  <p>"Nothing much. I was left entirely to myself. There was only one servant
  in the house, old Mitri the steward, and I had also my maid. The whole
  establishment was sent to Coventry. We had to get our food from the mainland,
  for we could buy nothing, except now and then a little milk through Mitri's
  married daughter. It wasn't pleasant, I can tell you. But the worst was when
  I went for a walk. If I met a man he would make the sign of the evil eye and
  spit. If I spoke to a child its mother would snatch it up and race indoors
  with it. The girls and women all wore blue beads as a charm against me, and
  carried garlic. I could smell it wherever I went. Sometimes I wanted to cry,
  and sometimes I wanted to swear, but you can do nothing with a silent
  boycott. I could have shaken the fools."</p>

  <p>"What had they against you? Did you ever find out?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, Mitri used to tell us gossip that he had heard through his daughter,
  but Mitri isn't too popular himself, and he is old and can go about very
  little. It seemed they called me Basilissa. That means Queen, and sounds
  friendly enough, but I think the word they really used was <i>diabolissa</i>,
  which means a she-devil. The better disposed ones thought I was a
  Nereid&mdash;that's what they call fairies&mdash;but some said I was a
  <i>strigla</i>&mdash;that's a horrible kind of harpy, and some thought I was
  a <i>vrykolakas</i>, which is a vampire. They used to light little fires in
  the graveyards to keep me away. Oh, I got very sick of my reputation. It was
  a hideous bore not to be able to go anywhere without seeing scared people
  dodging up byways, and making the sign of the cross, and screaming for their
  children&mdash;simply damnable."</p>

  <p>"It must have been damnable. I should have thought it rather terrifying
  too."</p>

  <p>"Don't imagine that they frightened me. I was really more sorry than
  angry. They were only foolish people scared half out of their minds, and,
  after all, my family has done a good deal to scare them. It is
  folly&mdash;nothing but folly, and the only way to beat folly is to live it
  down. I don't blame the poor devils, but I'm going to bring them to a better
  mind. I refuse to run away because of a pack of fairy tales."</p>

  <p>"There were no hostile acts?" I asked.</p>

  <p>She seemed to reflect. "No," she answered. "One morning we found a splash
  of blood on the house door, which sent old Mitri to his prayers. But that was
  only a silly joke."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Ertzberger hinted that there might be trouble this year from the
  people in the hills?"</p>

  <p>Her face hardened.</p>

  <p>"I wish to Heaven I knew that for certain. It would be the best news I
  ever got. Those hillmen are not my people, and if they interfere I will have
  them whipped off the place. I will not have any protection against my own
  peasantry&mdash;Theodore is always pressing me, but I won't have it&mdash;it
  would spoil everything&mdash;it wouldn't be the game. But if those filthy
  mountaineers come within a mile of Plakos I will hire a regiment to shoot
  them down. Pray God they come. We of the coast have always hated the
  mountains, and I believe I could rally my people."</p>

  <p>"But I thought you owned the whole island?"</p>

  <p>"No one owns the hills. My grandfather obtained the seigneury of Plakos,
  but he never claimed more than the good land by the sea. The hills have
  always been a no-man's-land full of bandits. We paid them dues&mdash;I still
  pay them&mdash;and we did not quarrel, but there was no coming and going
  between us. They are a different race from our pure Greek
  stock&mdash;mongrels of Slav and Turk, I believe."</p>

  <p>The spirit of the girl comforted me. If Ertzberger's news was true, it
  might save the situation, and bring the problem out of the realm of groping
  mystery to a straightforward defence of property...  But, after all, the
  hills were distant, and the scared tenants were at the house door. We must
  face the nearer peril.</p>

  <p>"Is there no one in the village," I said, "whom you can have it out with?
  No big farmer? What about the priests?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head. "No one. The priests do not love my family, for they
  call themselves Christians, while we are Catholics."</p>

  <p>Twenty years spent in examining witnesses has given me an acute instinct
  about candour. There was that in the girl's eyes and voice as she spoke which
  told me that she was keeping something back, something which made her
  uneasy.</p>

  <p>"Tell me everything," I said. "Has no priest talked to you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, there was one. I will tell you. He is an old man, and very timid. He
  came to me at night, after swearing Mitri to tell no one. He urged me to go
  away for ever."</p>

  <p>Her eyes were troubled now, and had that abstracted look which I had noted
  before.</p>

  <p>"What was his reason?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, care for his precious church. He was alarmed about what had happened
  at Easter."</p>

  <p>She stopped suddenly.</p>

  <p>"Have you ever been in Greece at Easter&mdash;during the Great Week? No?
  Then you cannot imagine how queer it is. The people have been starved all
  Lent, living only on cuttle-fish soup and bread and water. Every one is pale
  and thin and ill-tempered. It is like a nightmare."</p>

  <p>Then in rapid staccato sentences she sketched the ritual. She described
  the night of Good Friday, when the bier with the figure of the crucified
  Christ on it stands below the chancel step, and the priests chant their
  solemn hymn, and the women kiss the dead face, and the body is borne out to
  burial. With torches and candles flickering in the night wind, it is carried
  through the village streets, while dirges are sung, and the tense crowd
  breaks now and then into a moan or a sigh. Next day there is no work done,
  but the people wander about miserably, waiting on something which may be
  either death or deliverance. That night the church is again crowded, and at
  midnight the curtains which screen the chancel are opened, and the bier is
  revealed&mdash; empty, but for a shroud. "Christ is risen," the priest cries,
  as a second curtain is drawn back, and in the sanctuary, in an ineffable
  radiance, stands the figure of the risen Lord. The people go mad with joy,
  they light their tapers at the priest's candle, and, like a procession of
  Bacchanals, stream out, shouting "He is risen indeed." Then to the
  accompaniment of the firing of guns and the waving of torches the famished
  peasants, maddened by the miracle they have witnessed, feast till morning on
  wine and lamb's flesh in the joy of their redemption.</p>

  <p>She drew the picture for me so that I saw it as if with my own eyes, and
  my imagination quickened under the spell of her emotion. For here was no
  longer the cool, matter-of-fact young woman of the world, with no more than
  tolerance for the folly of superstition. It was some one who could enter into
  that very mood, and feel its quivering nerves and alternate despair and
  exultation.</p>

  <p>"What had the priest to complain of?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"He said that the people were becoming careless of the Easter holiness. He
  said that last year the attendance at the rite was poor. He feared that they
  were beginning to think of something else."</p>

  <p>"Something else!" Two of the most commonplace words in the language. She
  spoke them in an even voice in an ordinary London dining-room, with outside
  the wholesome bustle of London and the tonic freshness of an English winter
  day. She was about to go off to a conventional English week-end party at a
  prosaic country house. But the words affected me strangely, for they seemed
  to suggest a peril far more deadly than any turbulence of wild men from the
  hills&mdash;a peril, too, of which she was aware.</p>

  <p>For she was conscious of it&mdash;that was now perfectly clear to
  me&mdash;acutely conscious. She had magnificent self-command, but fear showed
  out from behind it, like light through the crack of a shutter. Her courage
  was assuredly not the valour of ignorance. She was terrified, and still
  resolute to go on.</p>

  <p>It was not my business to add to that terror. Suddenly I had come to feel
  an immense pity and reverence for this girl. Ertzberger was right. Her
  hardness, her lack of delicacy and repose, her loud frivolity, were only on
  the surface&mdash;a protective sheathing for a tormented soul. Out of a
  miserable childhood and a ramshackle education she had made for herself a
  code of honour as fine and as hard as steel. It was wildly foolish, of
  course, but so perhaps to our dull eyes the innocent and the heroic must
  always be.</p>

  <p>Perhaps she guessed my thoughts. For when she spoke again it was gently,
  almost hesitatingly.</p>

  <p>"I scarcely hoped that you could tell me anything about Plakos. But I
  rather hoped you would say I am right in what I am doing. Theodore has been
  so discouraging...  I rather hoped from your face that you would take a
  different view. You wouldn't advise me to run away from my job&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"God forbid that I should advise you at all," I said. "I see your
  argument, and, if you will let me say so, I profoundly respect it. But I
  think you are trying yourself&mdash;and your friends also&mdash;too high. You
  must agree to some protection."</p>

  <p>"Only if the hill folk give trouble. Don't you see, protection would ruin
  everything if I accepted it against my own people? I must trust myself to
  them&mdash;and&mdash;and stick it out myself. It is a sort of atonement."</p>

  <p>Then she got up briskly and held out her hand.</p>

  <p>"Thank you very much, Sir Edward. It has done me good to talk to you. I
  must be off now or I'll miss my train. I'll give your love to Mollie and
  Tom."</p>

  <p>"We shall meet again. When do you leave England?"</p>

  <p>"Not till March. Of course we'll meet again. Let me know if you have any
  bright idea...  &Eacute;lise, &Eacute;lise! Where's that fool woman?"</p>

  <p>Her maid appeared.</p>

  <p>"Get a taxi at once," she ordered. "We haven't any time to waste, for I
  promised to pick up Lord Cheviot at his flat."</p>

  <p>I asked one question as I left. "Have you ever heard of a place called
  Kynaetho?"</p>

  <p>"Rather. It's the big village in Plakos close to the house."</p><br>
 <br>

  <h2><a name="chap7"
     id="chap7">CHAPTER 7</a></h2>

  <p>I once read in some book about Cleopatra that that astonishing lady owed
  her charm to the fact that she was the last of an ancient and disreputable
  race. The writer cited other cases&mdash;Mary of Scots, I think, was one. It
  seemed, he said, that the quality of high-coloured ancestors flowered in the
  ultimate child of the race into something like witchcraft. Whether they were
  good or evil, they laid a spell on men's hearts. Their position, fragile and
  forlorn, without the wardenship of male kinsfolk, set them on a romantic
  pinnacle. They were more feminine and capricious than other women, but they
  seemed, like Viola, to be all the brothers as well as all the daughters of
  their father's house, for their soft grace covered steel and fire. They were
  the true sorceresses of history, said my author, and sober men, not knowing
  why, followed blindly in their service.</p>

  <p>Perhaps Kor&eacute; Arabia was of this sisterhood. At any rate one sober
  man was beginning to admit her compelling power. I could not get the girl
  from my thoughts. For one thing I had awakened to a comprehension of her
  beauty. Her face was rarely out of my mind, with its arrogant innocence, its
  sudden brilliancies and its as sudden languors. Her movements delighted me,
  her darting grace, the insolent assurance of her carriage, and then, without
  warning, the relapse into the child or the hoyden. Even her bad manners soon
  ceased to annoy me, for in my eyes they had lost all vulgarity. They were the
  harshnesses of a creature staving off tragedy. Indeed it was her very
  extravagances that allured, for they made me see her as a solitary little
  figure set in a patch of light on a great stage among shadows, defying of her
  own choice the terrors of the unknown.</p>

  <p>What made my capture complete was the way she treated me. She seemed to
  have chosen me as her friend, and to find comfort and security in being with
  me. To others she might be rude and petulant, but never to me. Whenever she
  saw me she would make straight for me, like a docile child waiting for
  orders. She would dance or sit out with me till her retinue of youth was
  goaded to fury. She seemed to guess at the points in her behaviour which I
  did not like and to strive to amend them. We had become the closest friends,
  and friendship with Kor&eacute; Arabin was a dangerous pastime.</p>

  <p>The result was that I was in a fair way of making a fool of myself. No...
  I don't think I was in love with her. I had never been in love in my life, so
  I was not an expert on the subject, but I fancied that love took people in a
  different way. But I was within measurable distance of asking her to be my
  wife. My feeling was a mixture of affection and pity and anxiety. She had
  appealed to me, and I had become her champion. I wanted to protect her, but
  how was a middle-aged lawyer to protect a determined girl from far-away
  perils which he did not comprehend? The desperate expedient of marriage
  occurred to me, but I did not believe she would accept me, and, if she did,
  would not the mating of age and youth be an outrage and a folly? Nevertheless
  I was in a mood to venture even on that.</p>

  <p>I must have presented a strange spectacle to my friends. There were other
  men of forty in London at the time who behaved as if they were
  twenty-five&mdash;one buxom Cabinet Minister was to be seen at every
  dance&mdash;but none, I am certain, cut an odder figure than I. The dancing
  Cabinet Minister sought the ballroom for exercise, because he preferred
  dancing to golf. I had no such excuse, for I danced comparatively little; my
  object was patently the society of one particular lady. In Kor&eacute;'s
  train I found myself in strange haunts. I followed her into the Bohemian
  <i>coulisses</i> to which Shelley Arabin's daughter had an
  entr&eacute;e&mdash;queer studio parties in Chelsea where the women were
  shorn and the men left shaggy: the feverish literary and artistic salons of
  the emancipated and rather derelict middle-class: dances given at extravagant
  restaurants by the English and foreign new-rich, where I did not know or wish
  to know one single soul. Also we appeared together at houses which I had
  frequented all my life, and there my friends saw me. Of course they talked. I
  fancy that for about two months I was the prime subject of London gossip. I
  didn't care a hang, for I was in a queer, obstinate, excitable mood. We
  hunted together, too, and there is no such nursery of scandal as the
  hunting-field. With a great deal of work on hand I found this new life a
  considerable strain, and I was perfectly conscious that I was playing the
  fool. But, though I don't think I was in love with her, I simply could not
  let the girl out of my sight.</p>

  <p>Now and then my conscience awoke, and I realized with a shock that the
  time was slipping past, and that the real problem was still unsolved. I knew
  that I could not shake Kor&eacute; in her resolution, and I suppose I hoped
  blindly that something would occur to prevent her acting on it. That
  something could only be a love affair. I was perfectly certain that she was
  not in love with me, but she might accept me, and at the back of my head I
  had the intention of putting it to the test. Ertzberger had divined what was
  going on and seemed to approve. "A boy is no use to her," he said more than
  once. "Besides, she wouldn't look at one. She must marry a grown man." He
  implied that I filled the bill, and the man's assumption gave me an absurd
  pleasure. If any one had told me that I would one day go out of my way to
  cultivate a little Jew financier, I would have given him the lie, yet the
  truth is that, when I was not with Kor&eacute;, I hungered for Ertzberger's
  company. He alone understood what was in my mind, and shared my anxieties.
  "She must not go back," he kept declaring; "at all costs she must be kept
  away from Plakos&mdash;at any rate during this spring. I get disquieting
  reports. There is mischief brewing in the hills, and the people of the coast
  have had a bitter winter of famine. There has been a lot of sickness, too,
  and in the village at the house gates the mortality among the children has
  been heavy."</p>

  <p>"You mean Kynaetho?" I asked,</p>

  <p>"Kynaetho." He looked at me curiously. "You seem to have been getting up
  the subject...  Well, I don't like it. If she goes there in April there may
  be a disaster. Upon my soul, we should be justified in having her kidnapped
  and shut up in some safe place till the summer. So far as I can learn, the
  danger is only in the spring. Once let the people see the crops springing and
  the caiques bringing in fish, and they will forget their grievances."</p>

  <p>Early in March I was dining with the Nantleys, and after dinner Mollie
  took me aside for a talk. As I have told you, she is one of my oldest
  friends, for when I was a grubby little private schoolboy and she was a girl
  of thirteen, we used to scamper about together. I had had her son Hugo in my
  chambers, before he went into Parliament, and Wirlesdon had always been a
  sort of home to me. Mollie was entitled to say anything she liked, but when
  she spoke it was rather timidly.</p>

  <p>"I hear a good deal of talk about you," she said, "and I can't help
  noticing too. Do you think it is quite fair, Ned?"</p>

  <p>"Fair to whom?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"To Kor&eacute; Arabin. You're different from the boys who run after her.
  You're a distinguished man with a great reputation. Is it fair to her to turn
  her head?"</p>

  <p>"Is that very likely? What if she has turned mine?"</p>

  <p>"Do you really mean that?" she cried. "I never thought of it in that way.
  Do you honestly want to marry her?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know...  I don't know what I want except that I must stand by
  her. She's in an appallingly difficult position, and badly needs a
  friend."</p>

  <p>"Yes. But there's only one way in which a man can protect a young woman.
  Do you mean to marry her?"</p>

  <p>"She wouldn't accept me."</p>

  <p>"But you mean to ask her?"</p>

  <p>"It may come to that," I said.</p>

  <p>"But, Ned dear, can't you see it wouldn't do? Kor&eacute; is not the right
  sort of wife for you. She's&mdash;she's too&mdash;Well, you've a career
  before you. Is she the woman to share it with you?"</p>

  <p>"It's not many months since, at Wirlesdon, you implored my charity for
  Miss Arabin."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I don't want to say a word against her, and if you were really
  desperately in love I would say nothing and wish you luck. But I don't
  believe you are. I believe it's what you say&mdash; charity, and that's a
  most rotten foundation to build on."</p>

  <p>Mollie, in such affairs, is an incurable romantic.</p>

  <p>"I promise never to ask her to marry me unless I am in love," I said.</p>

  <p>"Well, that means you are not quite in love yet. Hadn't you better draw
  back before it is too late? I can't bear to see you making a bad blunder, and
  Kor&eacute;, dear child, would be a bad blunder for you. She's adorably
  pretty, and she has wonderful qualities, but she is a little savage, and very
  young, and quite unformed. Really, really it wouldn't do."</p>

  <p>"I admit the difficulties, my dear Mollie. But never mind me, and think of
  Miss Arabin. You said yourself that she was English at heart and would be
  very happy settled in England."</p>

  <p>"But not with you."</p>

  <p>"She wouldn't accept me, and I may never propose. But if I did, and she
  accepted me, why not with me?"</p>

  <p>"Because you're you&mdash;because you're too good for a rash
  experiment."</p>

  <p>"I'm not good enough for her, for I'm too old, as you've just told me. But
  anyhow your argument thinks principally of me, not of Miss Arabin. It is she
  who matters."</p>

  <p>Mollie rose with a gesture of impatience. "You are hopeless, Ned. I'm sick
  of you hard, unsusceptible, ambitious people. You never fall in love in your
  youth, but wait till after forty, and then make idiots of yourselves."</p>

  <p>I had a different kind of remonstrance from Vernon. We saw little of each
  other in these days beyond a chance word in the street or a casual wave of
  the hand in the club smoking-room. When I thought of him it was with a sense
  of shame that I had let him slip so hopelessly out of my life. Time had been
  when he was my closest friend, and when his problem was also my problem. Now
  the whole story of his dream seemed a childish fancy.</p>

  <p>One night in March I found him waiting for me in my rooms.</p>

  <p>"I came round to say good-bye," he said. "I shall probably leave London
  very soon."</p>

  <p>It shows how completely I had forgotten his affairs that I did not
  remember that his particular crisis was drawing near, that, as he believed,
  the last door of his dream-world would soon be opened.</p>

  <p>Then, before I could ask about his plans, he suddenly broke out:</p>

  <p>"Look here, I hope there's no truth in what people tell me."</p>

  <p>His tone had the roughness of one very little at his ease, and it annoyed
  me. I asked coldly what he meant.</p>

  <p>"You know what I mean&mdash;that you're in love with Miss
  What's-her-name&mdash;the girl I met at Wirlesdon."</p>

  <p>"I don't know that you've any right to ask the question, and I'm certainly
  not going to answer it."</p>

  <p>"That means that you are in love," he cried. "Good God, man, don't tell me
  that you want to marry that&mdash;that tawdry girl!"</p>

  <p>I must have reddened, for he saw that he had gone too far.</p>

  <p>"I don't mean that&mdash;I apologize. I have no reason to say anything
  against her."</p>

  <p>Then his tone changed.</p>

  <p>"Ned, old man, we have been friends for a long time, and you must forgive
  me if I take liberties. We have never had any secrets from each other. My own
  affairs give me a good deal to think about just now, but I can't go away with
  an easy mind till I know the truth about you. For God's sake, old fellow,
  don't do anything rash. Promise me you won't propose to her till I come back
  in April."</p>

  <p>His change of manner had softened me, and as I saw the trouble in his
  honest eyes I felt a return of the old affection.</p>

  <p>"Why are you anxious on my account?"</p>

  <p>"Because," he said solemnly, "I know that if you married that girl our
  friendship would be over. I feel it in my bones. She would always come
  between us."</p>

  <p>"I can't make any promises of that kind. But one thing I can
  promise&mdash;that no woman will ever break our friendship."</p>

  <p>"You don't understand. Some women wouldn't, but that girl&mdash;! Well, I
  can say no more. Good-bye, Ned. I'll hunt you up when I come back."</p>

  <p>He left me with a feeling of mingled regret and irritation. I hated to go
  against Vernon's wishes, but his manner when he had spoken of Kor&eacute;,
  the look in his eyes, the inflection in his voice, conveyed an utter distaste
  which made me angry. I pictured him at Severns nursing his unreasoning
  dislike of the poor child. Vernon, as my nephew Charles had said, was a prig,
  and his narrow world had room only for blameless and vapid virginity. The
  promise he had asked of me was an outrage.</p>

  <p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

  <p>Yet I kept a promise which I had never made. For suddenly Cinderella
  disappeared from the ball. After a country-house dance I drove her back to
  town in my car, and left her at the door of her flat. During the long drive
  she had talked more seriously than I had ever known her to talk before, had
  spoken of herself and her affairs with a kind of valiant simplicity. The only
  sophisticated thing about her was her complexion. All day afterwards my
  conviction was growing that she was the woman for me, that I could make her
  not only secure but happy. We were by way of dining with the Lamanchas, and I
  think if we had met that night I should have asked her to marry me...  But we
  did not meet, for by the evening she was gone.</p>

  <p>I looked for her in vain in the Lamanchas' drawing-room, and my hostess
  guessed what I sought. "I'm so sorry about Kor&eacute; Arabin," she whispered
  to me. "She was coming to-night, but she telephoned this afternoon that she
  was unexpectedly called out of town." I did not enjoy my dinner, and as soon
  as I could decently leave I hurried off to her flat. It was shut up, and from
  the porter on the ground floor I learned that she and her maid had left with
  a quantity of luggage to catch the night boat to France. He was positive that
  she had gone abroad, for he had seen the foreign labels, and Miss Arabin had
  told him she would not be back for months. The keys of the flat had been sent
  to her solicitors.</p>

  <p>With a very uneasy mind I drove to the Ertzbergers' house in Belgrave
  Square. Ertzberger had just come in from a City dinner, and his wife seemed
  to be giving some kind of musical party, for the hall was full of coats and
  hats and extra footmen, and the jigging of fiddles drifted down the
  staircase. He took me to his study at the back of the house, and when he
  heard my news his face grew as solemn as my own. There was nothing to be done
  that night, for the Continental mail had long since gone, so I went back to
  my chambers with a pretty anxious mind. I felt that I had let something rare
  and precious slip out of my hand, but far more that this preciousness was in
  instant danger. Honestly I don't think that I was much concerned about
  myself. I wanted Kor&eacute; Arabin saved&mdash;for me&mdash;for every
  one&mdash;for the world. If I was in love with her it was with an affection
  more impersonal than usually goes by that name. It was as if an adored child
  had gone amissing.</p>

  <p>Regardless of our many engagements, Ertzberger and I appeared on the
  doorstep of Messrs. Mower and Lidderdale, the solicitors, at the hour when,
  according to the information given me by telephone, the senior partner
  usually arrived. Mr. Mower confirmed our fears. Miss Arabin had returned to
  Plakos; she had been preparing for some weeks for the journey; he had not
  advised it&mdash;indeed he had not been asked his advice nor would he have
  dared to volunteer it. "A very strong-minded young lady," he
  repeated&mdash;"I might almost say strong-headed." She had sold the lease of
  her flat, and had left no instructions about her return. Yes, she was well
  supplied with money. Miss Arabin was her own mistress absolutely, for her
  father had created no trust. He had nothing more to tell us, and Ertzberger
  departed for the City and I for the Temple.</p>

  <p>In the afternoon I was rung up by Ertzberger in my room in the House of
  Commons. He had been making inquiries, he said&mdash; he had his own ways of
  doing that sort of thing&mdash;and he had discovered that Kor&eacute; had
  recently sold large parcels of stocks. She had been selling out steadily
  throughout the winter, and now had practically no investments left. The
  proceeds had been deposited on current account in her bank. There his
  information stopped, but he was profoundly disquieted. "That child has all
  her fortune in cash under her hand," he said, "and God knows what she means
  to do with it. Any moment she may beggar herself, and no one can prevent
  her."</p>

  <p>That night I understood that my infatuation was over, if indeed it had
  ever existed. I wanted the girl safe, and I did not care who saved her, but I
  wanted it so much that at the moment nothing in heaven or earth seemed to
  matter in comparison.</p>

  <p>It was now near the end of March, the Courts had just risen, and
  Parliament was about to adjourn for the Easter vacation. I had a good deal of
  important work on hand, but I was entitled to a holiday, and I thought I
  could arrange for at any rate a fortnight's absence from town. But whether I
  could arrange it or not I meant to go, for I could no more settle to my tasks
  than a boy can settle to Tacitus on the day he is playing for his school.
  When Ertzberger, according to our arrangement, turned up at my chambers that
  night after dinner, he found me busy with an atlas and a Continental
  Bradshaw.</p>

  <p>"I am going to Plakos," I said.</p>

  <p>"That is good. You are still a young man, and you have been a soldier. It
  is very good. But if you had not gone, I had decided to go myself."</p>

  <p>"This is Wednesday. Miss Arabin left last night. She will get
  there&mdash;when?"</p>

  <p>He made some calculations. "Not before Tuesday. You might overtake her,
  but I do not think that is necessary. Easter is the danger-point, and the
  Greek Easter is still a fortnight off. Besides you must stop a day in
  Athens."</p>

  <p>"I shall want help. Can you get me half a dozen handy fellows I can
  trust?"</p>

  <p>"I had thought of that. Indeed I telegraphed about it this afternoon. I
  can find you the men&mdash;and money, of course, if you want it. I will find
  you a lieutenant, too, and make all arrangements about transport. That at
  least I can do. You realize, Sir Edward, that there is a certain danger in
  this enterprise?"</p>

  <p>"I realize that Miss Arabin in a week's time will be in deadly danger...
  I must have a day or two to wind up my work here. I think I can leave on
  Saturday morning."</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact I left London on the Friday night.</p><br>

  <h3><a name="chap8"
     id="chap8">CHAPTER 8</a></h2>

  <p>I came to Plakos in a blind sea-fog. After a day and a night of storm the
  wind died utterly, and we made the isle on a compass course, feeling our way
  in by constant soundings. A thick salt dew hung on every stay and hawser, the
  deck and bulwarks swam with moisture, and our coats were in an instant
  drenched as if we had been out in a hurricane. Sea and land alike were
  invisible. The air was thick and oppressive to the breath, and every muscle
  in the body felt weak and flaccid. Also there was a strange quiet&mdash;only
  the ripple caused by our slow movement and the creak of sodden cordage. I
  might have been a shade looking on an island of the dead.</p>

  <p>I had reached Athens in record time, but there I found a weariful delay.
  In spite of Ertzberger's influence the wheels were clogged. I was met at the
  Piraeus by his agent, one Constantine Maris, whose instructions were to hold
  himself at my disposal. I took to Maris at once&mdash;a young fellow of
  thirty, who had been in the Greek regular army and had been the right-hand
  man of Zimbrakis when at Salonika his troops declared for Venizelos. He had
  been all through the war till it ended in Bulgaria's submission, had been
  twice wounded and once in prison, and had been chosen by Ertzberger to
  represent him in Athens because of his truculent honesty and tireless energy.
  Both in character and appearance he was more like a Frenchman than a
  Greek&mdash;a Norman, for choice, for he had reddish-brown hair and a
  high-bridged northern nose. He had the additional merit of being well
  educated, having put in two years at the Sorbonne: and he talked excellent
  French. His family were of Athens, but his mother, I think, was from one of
  the islands. He had the looks and manners of a soldier.</p>

  <p>But Maris had found the task set him almost impossible. Ertzberger had
  bidden him get together a batch of reliable fellows who would obey orders and
  ask no questions, but as we rumbled Athens-ward from the Piraeus in the
  little train he confessed that such men were not to be found. In the war it
  was otherwise, but the best had all gone back to the country villages. He had
  collected a dozen, but he was not enthusiastic about them, except a certain
  Janni, who had been a corporal in his old battalion. When he paraded them for
  my inspection I was inclined to agree with him. They were an odd
  mixture&mdash; every kind of clothes from the dirty blue jeans of the stoker
  to the black coat and pointed yellow shoes of the clerk&mdash;ages from
  nineteen to sixty&mdash;physique from prize-fighter to sneak-thief. All had
  served in the war, however, and the best of them, Janni, had an empty left
  sleeve. After much consultation we dismissed two and were left with ten who
  at any rate looked honest. Whether they would be efficient was another
  matter. Maris proposed to arm them with revolvers, but not till we got to
  Plakos, in case they started shooting up the town. They were told that they
  were wanted as guards for an estate which was threatened by brigands, but I
  doubt if they believed it. The younger ones seemed to think that our object
  was piracy.</p>

  <p>Transport was another problem. I had hoped to be able to hire a small
  steam yacht, but such a thing was not to be had, and the best we could do was
  to induce a dissolute-looking little Leghorn freighter, named the <i>Santa
  Lucia</i>, to go out of its way and touch at Plakos. Maris told the captain a
  yarn about men being needed there for making a new sea-wall. The boat was
  bound for the Dodecanese, and would pick us up on her return a fortnight
  later.</p>

  <p>Before we rounded Cape Sunium we got into foul weather, a heavy
  north-easter and violent scurries of rain. Our ruffians were all sea-sick and
  lay about like logs, getting well cursed by the Italian sailors, while Maris
  and I, in the one frowsy little cabin, tried to make a plan of campaign. I
  found out at once that Maris was well informed about the situation in Plakos,
  partly from Ertzberger and partly from his own knowledge. He knew about
  Shelley Arabin's career, which seemed to be the common talk of the Aegean. Of
  Kor&eacute; he had heard nothing save from Ertzberger, but he had much to
  tell me of Plakos and its people. They had a name for backwardness and
  turbulence, and the Government seemed to leave them very much to themselves.
  There were gendarmes, of course, in the island, but he fancied they didn't
  function. But the place had sent good soldiers to Venizelos, and its people
  were true Hellenes. After an interval when he expatiated on that Hellenic
  empire of the islands which was the dream of good Venizelists, he returned to
  their superstition. "That is the curse of my countrymen," he cried. "They are
  priest-ridden." He was himself, he told me, a free-thinker and despised all
  mumbo-jumbo.</p>

  <p>I told him that the trouble was not with the priests, but he did not seem
  to understand, and I did not attempt to explain.</p>

  <p>Our task, as we saw it, was straightforward enough&mdash;to protect the
  House during the Easter season when fear of the girl as a witch and the
  memory of Shelley's misdeeds might induce some act of violence. There was
  also the trouble with the hill folk, and this seemed to him the greater
  danger. The dwellers in the stony mountains which filled the centre and south
  of the island had always been out of hand, and, since the winter had been
  cruel and the war had unsettled the whole earth, he thought it likely that
  they might have a try at looting the House, which they no doubt held to be
  full of treasure, since the Arabins had a name for wealth. I could see that
  he didn't quite believe in danger from the coast folk, however beastly their
  superstitions might be. He had the Greek respect for a mountaineer and
  contempt for the ordinary peasant.</p>

  <p>We studied the map&mdash;a very good one prepared for the British
  Navy&mdash;and on Maris's advice I decided to begin by dividing our forces.
  My first business was to get into the House and discover how things were
  going. But with danger threatening from the hills it would be unwise for all
  of us to concentrate in a place from which egress might be difficult. Now the
  House stood at the northwest corner of the island, and the hill country began
  about ten miles to the south-east. He proposed to send five of our men, under
  Corporal Janni, to a little port called Vano on the west coast some miles
  south of the House. They would take supplies with them&mdash;we were well
  provided with these&mdash;and reconnoitre towards the hills, giving out that
  they were a Government survey party. The rest of us would land at the House,
  and, after satisfying ourselves about the position, would get in touch with
  Janni by the overland route. Our first business was strictly reconnaissance;
  Janni could not hope to prevent mischief from the hills if it were really on
  its way, but he could satisfy himself as to its extent and character, and
  then join us in the defence of the House, which was our main task. Maris was
  confident about this. He did not see how a dozen armed men in a strong place
  could fail to hold off a mob of undisciplined peasants.</p>

  <p>For an extra payment the captain of the <i>Santa Lucia</i> was induced to
  carry Janni and his men to Vano. Weapons were served out to all, and I gave
  Janni a map which he professed to be able to read. Then in the shrouding fog
  Maris and I and our five got into the ship's one boat and were rowed ashore.
  We had our supplies both of food and ammunition in half a dozen wooden cases,
  and the wretched cockle was pretty low in the water. I knew from my former
  visit that the landing-place was just below the House, and the fog seemed to
  me a godsend, for it would enable us to get indoors unobserved. My only doubt
  was the kind of reception we might get from Kor&eacute;.</p>

  <p>As it turned out, the mist was our undoing. We were landed at a stone
  jetty in a dead white blanket which made it difficult to see a yard ahead.
  Our baggage was put on shore, the boat started back, and in a moment both
  sound and sight of it were swallowed up. It was an eerie business, and I felt
  the craziness of our errand as I stood blinking on the wet cobbles. There was
  no human being about, but the dim shapes of several caiques and some kind of
  lugger seemed to show below us as we started along the jetty. Our five
  ruffians had recovered from their sea-sickness, and, feeling solid ground
  beneath them, were inclined to be jolly. One of them started a song, which I
  promptly checked. Maris ordered them to wait behind with the boxes, and to
  keep dead quiet, while he and I prospected inland.</p>

  <p>My recollection of that visit in 1914 was hazy, for I had only seen the
  landing-place from the causeway above it, and at the time I had been too
  preoccupied to observe accurately. But I was pretty certain that at the shore
  end of the jetty there were some rough stone steps which led to the causeway.
  I groped for them in the mist but could not find them. Instead I came on a
  broad track which bore the mark of wheels and which led away to the left. I
  waited for the steep to begin, but found no sign of it. The land was dead
  flat for a long way, and then I came on a rough boundary wall.</p>

  <p>It was an orchard with blossoming trees&mdash;that much I could see
  through the brume&mdash;and at the end was a cottage. My first thought was to
  retrace my steps and try a cast to the right, for I still believed that we
  had found the proper landing-place, and had somehow missed the causeway. But,
  as I hesitated, there came one of those sudden clearings in the air which
  happen in the densest fogs, and I had a prospect of some hundreds of yards
  around me. We were on the edge of a village, the cottage we had reached was
  at the extreme seaward end, a little detached from the rest; beyond lay what
  seemed to be a shallow valley with no sign of the House and its embattled
  hill.</p>

  <p>It would have been well for us if, there and then, we had turned and gone
  back to the jetty, even at the risk of relinquishing our supplies and having
  to scramble for miles along a difficult shore. For, of course, we had come in
  that infernal fog to the wrong place. The skipper had landed us at Kynaetho
  instead of below the House, and though I knew from the map that Kynaetho was
  at the House's gates, yet it was on the east side, distant at least two miles
  by coast from the spot which Vernon and I had visited.</p>

  <p>It was Maris who decided me. The cottage seemed a solitary place where
  discreet inquiries might be made without rousing attention. He had little
  stomach for wandering around Plakos in fog, and we had our five men and the
  baggage to think of. I followed him into the rough courtyard, paved with
  cobbles, and strewn with refuse. The low walls were washed with red ochre and
  above the lintel a great black pentacle was painted. Also over the door was
  hung a bunch of garlic.</p>

  <p>There was a woman standing in the entry watching us. Maris took off his
  hat with a flourish, and poured out a torrent of soft-sounding dialect. She
  replied in a harsher accent, speaking with the back of her throat. She seemed
  to be inviting us to enter, but her face was curiously without expression,
  though her eyebrows worked nervously. She was a middle-aged woman, terribly
  disfigured by smallpox; her features were regular, and she had large,
  prominent, vacant black eyes. She was not in the least repulsive, but somehow
  she was not reassuring.</p>

  <p>As we entered the cottage she called out to some one at the back. A second
  later I heard footsteps as of a child running.</p>

  <p>Maris, as I learned afterwards, told her the story we had agreed
  on&mdash;that we were a Government survey party sent from Athens to make a
  map of the island. Then he felt his way to more delicate subjects. This was
  Kynaetho, he understood? There was a large house near which belonged to some
  foreigners? English, weren't they? Where, exactly, did it lie from the
  village, for, if he might venture to explain what madam no doubt knew, one
  must have a starting-point for a survey, and the Government had chosen that
  house?</p>

  <p>The woman's eyebrows twitched, and she crossed herself. She flung a hand
  over her left shoulder. "The place is there," she said. "I know nothing of
  it. I do not speak of it."</p>

  <p>All the time she was looking at us with her staring empty eyes, and I
  realized that she was in an extreme fright. There was certainly nothing in
  our appearance to discompose her, and I had the uneasy feeling which one has
  in the presence of a human being who is suffering from an emotion that one
  cannot fathom. Maris whispered to me that he did not like the look of things.
  "She has not offered us food," he said.</p>

  <p>Her ear must have caught some sound from out of doors, for her face
  suddenly showed relief. She walked to the window and cried to some one
  outside. Then she turned to us. "There are men now to speak with you." She
  had found her tongue, for as she hustled us out she kept muttering, with
  sidelong glances at us, what seemed to be an invocation to Saint Nicolas.
  Also she gripped Maris violently by the shoulder and spat words into his ear.
  He told me afterwards that she was advising him not to be a fool and to go
  home.</p>

  <p>The little courtyard had filled with people, most of them men, but with
  two or three old crones in the forefront. Their aspect was not threatening,
  but rather puzzled and timid. The men took off their hats in response to
  Maris's bow, and politely waited for him to speak. I noticed that they were a
  well-made, upstanding lot, but with the same flat expressionlessness as the
  woman of the cottage, and I guessed that that was a mask to hide fear.</p>

  <p>Maris told them the same story of our errand. He said&mdash; I repeat what
  he told me later&mdash;that our men and baggage were still down by the beach,
  and that he wanted to be directed to the inn. There was dead silence. The
  little crowd stared at us as if their lives depended on it, but not a
  syllable came in reply.</p>

  <p>This made Maris angry. "Are you dumb mules," he asked, "not to answer a
  simple question? I have heard that you of the islands boasted of your
  hospitality. Is this the way to treat strangers?"</p>

  <p>Still no answer. His taunts were as futile as his exposition. But, since I
  had nothing to do but to look on, I saw something which made me uneasy. The
  crowd was drawing together, and each was covertly touching the other's
  sleeve. There was a purpose in this mob, a purpose of action, and I don't
  like that kind of purpose when it is accompanied by fear.</p>

  <p>"Since you will not speak," Maris cried, "I will go to your priest. Where
  is his dwelling? Or do you treat your church as you treat your visitors?"</p>

  <p>This time he got a reply. A dozen voices spoke, and a dozen hands pointed
  towards the village.</p>

  <p>"It seems you are not dumb after all? We will seek a lodging from the
  priest, who doubtless has some regard for his country's Government. We have
  baggage with us&mdash;boxes of instruments and food&mdash;and they are now at
  the jetty. I want two able-bodied fellows to help carry them, and I will pay
  them well. Who offers?"</p>

  <p>But no one offered. Once again they were like gaping cattle. And then an
  old beldam in the foreground, who had been crossing herself vigorously, cried
  out a monosyllable, and instantly it was taken up in a shout.</p>

  <p>Maris turned to me with an angry smile. "They are advising us to go home.
  I can mention an island, my friend, in which there is going to be trouble.
  Let us go back to the shore. Perhaps the sight of our belongings will change
  their mind."</p>

  <p>They did not obstruct us, but opened a lane for us to pass&mdash;opened it
  with feverish haste, as if they were afraid of coming too near us. The fog
  had now thinned to a light haze, through which I already felt the glow of the
  sun. As we moved shorewards they trailed after us, keeping always a
  respectful distance, and halted fifty yards from the jetty.</p>

  <p>Our five fellows were sitting smoking on the boxes, and since we could get
  no help from the villagers, there was nothing for it but to carry the baggage
  ourselves. My first notion was to go straight to the House, of which by this
  time I could judge the whereabouts, and it would have been well for us
  perhaps if I had acted on that impulse. But, until I had prepared the way, I
  was shy of facing Kor&eacute; Arabia with a defence force which would make
  her furious, and I had a notion, too, that if I marched in broad daylight to
  the House gates there might be trouble with these scared and sullen natives.
  So I decided to go first to the inn, where we could leave our stuff, and then
  to interview the priest. After all, I knew from Kor&eacute; that the priest
  was alarmed about the local situation, and from him I might get some counsel.
  It seemed to me a case for wary walking.</p>

  <p>I could have laughed at that progress village-wards, if I hadn't been so
  anxious. The mob in front of us had doubled in size, and retreated
  mechanically before us till we were in the village street. The sun was now
  bright in the sky, and I had a view of the straggling houses, grouped thickly
  in the centre where there seemed to be a kind of <i>place</i>, and thinning
  out into farms and enclosures on the slopes of the green hills. It was a
  wide, shallow vale bounded on the south by low ridges; but on the west rose a
  higher tree-clad hill, and there were glimpses of white masonry which I took
  to be the House. Once we were in the village the crowd was enlarged by women
  and children. They kept a good distance, retiring a pace for every step we
  took, and when we entered the untidy square they huddled against the house
  doors as if they were forming guard. They were perfectly silent, even the
  children. It was an eerie business, I can assure you, promenading before that
  speechless, staring gallery. They were not an ill-looking race, as I have
  said, for the men were mostly well-built and upstanding, and though the old
  wives looked like the Witch of Endor, the young ones were often comely. But
  you could see that they were bitter poor, for their cheeks were thin and
  their eyes hollow. And beyond doubt they were in the throes of some nervous
  terror. I felt as if at any moment something might snap and the air be filled
  with a wild screaming.</p>

  <p>The inn was easy enough to find. A big plane tree grew before it, and in
  the yard behind the low whitewashed walls grew a second, beside a stone
  fountain which had not been erected within these last five hundred years. The
  place was only a wine-shop, with no guest-rooms for travellers, but there
  were ample outbuildings where our men could encamp. But there was no sign of
  any landlord. Maris and I pushed indoors and found no trace of life in the
  big drinking-room with its sanded floor, or in the purlieus beyond. The inn
  folk must have gone to swell the crowd in the street. But we found a
  reasonably clean barn at the back of the yard, and there Maris bade our
  fellows make their quarters, get ready their breakfast and await our return.
  Then the two of us set out to find the priest.</p>

  <p>The villagers had not pressed nearer. When we emerged into the street they
  were standing as we had left them, patiently staring. Maris cried out, asking
  to be shown the priest's house, and at that the spell seemed to be broken,
  for there was a shout in reply. A visit to the priest seemed to be in the
  popular view the right course for us to take. We were directed to a house a
  hundred yards on, next door to a squat church, and to my surprise we were not
  followed. Once they had seen us enter, the crowd remained to watch the inn
  door.</p>

  <p>The priest had evidently been apprised of our coming. His dwelling was
  only a bigger cottage, but in the furnishing of it there were a few signs of
  a class above the peasantry&mdash;a shelf of books, one or two gaudy
  religious pictures, a Swiss cuckoo clock, and, incongruously enough, two of
  the cheap copies of Tanagra statuettes which they sell in the Athens shops. I
  daresay he imagined that they were figures of saints. He was an old man,
  nearer eighty than seventy to my eye, and much bent in the shoulders. An
  unkempt beard fell over his chest, and his white hair was long and brushed
  back from his forehead like a recent fashion among young men in England. The
  skin was waxen white, and the lines on his face were like the grey shadows in
  a snowdrift. His eyes were mild, benevolent, and fanatical. He looked stupid
  but kind and, like everybody else in that mad place, horribly frightened.</p>

  <p>With him Maris went straight to the point.</p>

  <p>"We are a Government survey party, Pappa," he said. "But that story is for
  the peasants. To you we open our hearts. This gentleman is a colonel in the
  army of Britain, and likewise a member of the British Government. He is also
  a friend of the lady in the House of Plakos. What gadfly has bitten the
  people of this island? Come! We know much already, but we would hear your
  tale."</p>

  <p>The priest&mdash;his venerable name was Hieronymos&mdash; was ready enough
  to tell. With a wealth of gesticulation remarkable in one so ancient, but
  always with a lowered voice, he repeated crudely what we already knew. The
  people of Plakos had suffered much and long, and were now resolved to make an
  end of their incubus. The girl was a witch, and they had determined that she
  must die. They were only waiting till the convenient season. All this he said
  in the most matter-of-fact tone, as if it were a natural sequence of cause
  and effect.</p>

  <p>"But you would not consent to such barbarity?" Maris asked.</p>

  <p>"My consent is not asked," he replied. "Beyond doubt the woman is evil and
  comes of an evil stock. But the Scriptures teach mercy, and, though doubtless
  death is deserved, I would not counsel it. For if she is evil she is also
  witless. Why else did she return here, when she knew that the whole island
  desired her death? Did I not go to her secretly, as Nicodemus went to our
  Lord, and besought her never to return? And she has given immense sums of
  money to her enemies. Me she gave gold for the Church and that I have secure,
  but she has given it to others who have bought guns. The men from the hills,
  who are most bitter against her, carry rifles bought with her money."</p>

  <p>Now I knew why the foolish child had realized her investments.</p>

  <p>The priest was gaining confidence.</p>

  <p>"The death of a witch may be a righteous deed," he said, "but the hearts
  of this people are not righteous. They are dabbling in a blacker magic than
  hers, for they are following the Outland Things. And that is heresy and
  blasphemy, which in the eyes of Holy Church are sins not less mortal than
  witchcraft."</p>

  <p>Real anger, the jealous anger of a priest for his own prerogatives, blazed
  in his old eyes. He used for "outland things" the word <i>exotika</i>, the
  very word which had puzzled Vernon in the manuscript I gave him, till he
  found help from Basil of Caesarea. The word caught my ear, and I made Maris
  translate for me. He had clearly no compassion for poor Kor&eacute;, but he
  was up in arms for his Church. Maris tried to probe the trouble, but he got
  the vaguest answers. The man seemed eager to unburden his soul, and yet
  terrified to speak, and his eyes were always turning to the window and the
  closed street door.</p>

  <p>Last Eastertide there had been a lamentable neglect of sacred rites. This
  year the carelessness was complete. Holy Week had begun, but the minds of the
  people were not on its solemnities. "They fast indeed," he said, "but they do
  not pray." They had gone a-whoring after other gods, and what those other
  gods were it did not become a Christian man to consider. They meditated a
  sacrifice, but they had forgotten the sacrifice on which their salvation
  hung. "There is a madness which surges up at times in these islands. It
  happened so in my grandfather's day in Santorini, and there is no quelling it
  till some black deed has been done and the people come to their right minds
  in a bitter repentance." He, their priest, had become less regarded than a
  cur dog. Men stopped talking in the streets when he drew near, and would not
  meet his eyes. If he spoke, they moved off. They were conscious of a guilty
  purpose, and yet resolved on it, and he was powerless to check them. "They
  will come back, doubtless, and bemoan their folly, but in the meantime they
  are breaking the hearts of the saints and loading their miserable souls with
  sin."</p>

  <p>Then he broke off, and his face took an expression of shrewdness.</p>

  <p>"You have brought men with you. How many?"</p>

  <p>Maris told him ten stout fellows all armed.</p>

  <p>"What foolishness!" he cried. "The Government should have sent a
  regiment&mdash;a regiment with cannons. The madmen in Plakos are fifty times
  your number, and they have the hill folk at their back, and that is a
  thousand more."</p>

  <p>"Nevertheless," said Maris, "we may be sufficient to garrison the House,
  and protect the lady. I have heard that it is a strong place."</p>

  <p>He looked at us queerly. "No garrison is sufficient against fire. They
  will burn the House and all that is in it...  Listen to me, sirs. I do not
  think as you think. I have no care for the woman nor for any of her accursed
  race, but I have much care for the souls of this wayward people, and would
  save them from mortal sin. There are no two ways about it&mdash;the woman
  must burn, or she must depart. Can you carry her off?"</p>

  <p>Maris translated to me rapidly. "Things look ugly," he said, "and I rather
  think this old one talks sense. But to carry off the lady we must have a
  ship, and God knows where we shall find one. At Vano perhaps? Maybe we did
  wrong to separate our forces. It strikes me that the sooner we get into touch
  with friend Janni the better. It is indicated that one of us must presently
  make his way into the House, and that one had better be you. Let us
  interrogate the old one about the topography of this damned village."</p>

  <p>"You must enter the House," said the priest, in reply to Maris's question,
  "but it will be a task, I promise you, for Digenes the Cyprian. The place is
  guarded at all hours, and no one enters or leaves it without the knowledge of
  the warders. But it might be achieved by bold men under cover of dark. The
  moon is nearing its full, and when it has set in the small hours there might
  be a chance."</p>

  <p>I got out the map of the island, and tried to get him to give me my
  bearings. But he was hopeless with a map, and instead on the white
  hearthstone he drew a plan of his own. The main road to the House from
  Kynaetho ran west from the village square, up a lane lined with crofts and
  past a big olive grove, till it reached the wood of chestnuts which was the
  beginning of the demesne. All the ground on this side rose steeply, and there
  were dwellings almost to the gates, so that it would be hard to escape
  detection. To the left the slopes curved in a shallow vale, bounded on the
  east by the main road to the hills and to Vano, and to south and west by a
  rim of upland beyond which lay the rugged coastline and the sea. This vale
  was broad and flat, and tilted up gently towards the west, and it bore the
  curious name of the Dancing Floor. In the old days, said the priest, the
  Panegyria were held in it, the island festivals before poverty and madness
  came to Plakos. The Dancing Floor bordered on the demesne, and he thought
  that a way of entry might be found there.</p>

  <p>I made Maris ask about the shore road, but the priest was emphatic against
  it. There was no way into the House on that side except by the staircases
  from the jetty, which Vernon and I had seen in 1914, and there it was certain
  the watchers would be most vigilant. Besides the staircases were disused, and
  he believed that the postern doors had been walled up. The cliffs could not
  be climbed, and if the coast was followed towards the south the difficulties
  increased. From my recollection of the place, I thought he exaggerated, but I
  was not prepared to bank on a dim memory.</p>

  <p>"There is no time to lose," he said, with an earnestness which convinced
  me that, though our motives might be different, our purposes were alike. "In
  two days it will be Good Friday, and the night after comes the solemn hour
  when our Lord breaks the bonds of death. I grievously fear that that is the
  hour which my foolish folk have fixed for this sacrilege. If great sin is to
  be averted, the woman must be gone by then and the House given to the flames.
  The flames, I say, for whatever happens, there will be no peace in Plakos
  till it is in ashes. But let it be burned honestly and religiously, and not
  made an altar to the outland devils whom Holy Church has long ago cast into
  the darkness."</p>

  <p>The problem seemed to me to be clarifying itself. I was inclined to think
  that the priest was too badly scared to take a balanced view of things, and
  also too wrapped up in his religious anxieties. I agreed that we must somehow
  induce Kor&eacute; to come away, and that for this purpose we must get all
  our ten men together and beg, borrow, or steal some kind of boat. It was also
  plain that the sooner I got inside the House the better, for Kor&eacute;
  would need some persuading. I was not able to view the black magic of the
  villagers quite seriously. It was obviously a real peril, but it was so
  wholly outside the range of my mental conception that I took it as a
  straightforward risk, like that from a wild animal or a thunderstorm.</p>

  <p>Maris and I had a short talk in French, and settled our plans. He would go
  back to the inn and see our fellows fixed up for the night. Then he would
  make his way on foot towards Vano and get into touch with Janni. We fixed a
  point on his map, on the edge of the cliffs about two miles south of the
  House, where he was to bring Janni and his posse, and where next morning I
  was to take out the others to join him. There seemed no risk in leaving the
  five men in the inn for the night. The villagers would scarcely interfere
  with strangers who purported to be a Government survey party and had no
  desire to move. Nor was it likely that any obstacle would be set in the way
  of Maris's own journey. After all he was moving towards Vano and away from
  the prohibited area.</p>

  <p>My own case was more intricate. If I went back to the inn, it would be
  harder to make my way from it to the Dancing Floor, for I should have the
  village street to go through. We put this to the priest, and he proved
  unexpectedly helpful. Why should I not stay on in his house till the evening?
  The church was adjacent, and behind the church lay the graveyard, by which a
  road could be found to the Dancing Floor. He would give me food, if I cared
  to share his humble meal. The old fellow might be a bigot, but he was honest
  and friendly and patently on our side. I beamed on him and thanked him in
  dumb show, while Maris made ready to start.</p>

  <p>"Get into the House somehow and fix up a plan with the lady," he said.
  "That is the first job. You are quite clear about the rendezvous on the
  cliffs? You had better get back to the inn somehow, and to-morrow morning
  bring the men to join me there. The village will think we've started on our
  surveying&mdash;and a long way off the danger-point. You will have to open
  the boxes and make each man carry his own supplies. You have your gun?"</p>

  <p>I patted my pocket. "Yes, but there isn't going to be any shooting. We
  haven't a dog's chance at that game, with Miss Arabin arming the natives with
  Mauser rifles."</p><br>
 <br>

  <h2><a name="chap9"
     id="chap9">CHAPTER 9</a></h2>

  <p>Many times that day I wished that my education had included modern Greek.
  Through the hot afternoon and evening I remained in the little room, bored
  and anxious and mystified, while the priest sat opposite me, a storehouse of
  vital knowledge which I could not unlock. I raked up my recollection of
  classical Greek, and tried him with a sentence or two, but he only shook his
  head. Most of the time he read in a little book, a breviary no doubt, and his
  lips muttered. An old woman came in and made ready a meal. We lunched off
  onion soup and black bread, and I was given a glass of some wine which
  smacked of turpentine. I smoked one of the two cigarettes left in my case,
  and afterwards fell asleep. When I woke the old man was sitting just as I had
  left him, but he had laid down his book and seemed to be praying. There was
  no reserve now in the old face; I saw the age of it, and the innocence, and
  also the blind fear. He seemed to be pleading fiercely with his God, and his
  mouth worked like a child's in a passion of disquiet.</p>

  <p>Of course I might have strolled out of doors, and gone back to the inn,
  where I could have seen our five men and retrieved my pipe and pouch. It
  struck me that we were behaving like fools; we had come to visit the House,
  and we ought to lose no time in getting there. My nap had put our previous
  talk out of my head, and I found myself on my feet in a sudden impulse. Then
  I remembered how Maris had enjoined the utmost caution, and I remembered,
  too, the look of those queer people in the street. The House was <i>tabu</i>,
  and if I was seen going towards it I should be stopped, and I might even
  precipitate some wild mischief without Maris to help me. There in the
  priest's homely kitchen, with a belt of golden light on the floor and the hum
  of flies in the window, I had an acute sense of being among shadows which
  might suddenly turn into monstrous forms of life. The whole island seemed to
  me like a snake still numb from the winter cold, but thawing fast into a
  malignant activity. And meantime Kor&eacute; was all alone in that ill-omened
  House with the circle of hate closing around her, and I, who had come there
  to protect her, was still outside the cordon. I cursed the infernal fog which
  had brought us so fatally out of our course; and I resolved that no power on
  earth would hinder me, when the dark came, from piercing the barrier.</p>

  <p>The presbytery opened into a narrow lane with outbuildings in front of it,
  but from the window I could see a corner of the main street. The sun poured
  into the lane, and I watched the little green lizards on the wall beyond.
  There was scarcely a sign of life in the segment I saw of the main street;
  indeed there was a silence strange in a village, so that every tiny natural
  noise&mdash;the chirping of grasshoppers, the slow flight of a
  dove&mdash;came with a startling clearness. Once a woman with a shawl over
  her head hurried past the opening. There should have been children playing at
  the corner, but there were no children nor any sound of them. Never a cart
  rumbled by, nor mule nor horse crossed my line of vision. The village seemed
  to be keeping an eerie fast.</p>

  <p>One man indeed I saw&mdash;a big fellow with a white blouse and long boots
  of untanned leather. He stood staring down the alley, and I noticed that he
  carried a rifle. I beckoned to the priest, and we watched him together out of
  a corner of the window. The old man shook his head violently and muttered
  something which ended in "bounos." Then he added between his teeth a word
  which sounded like "Callicantzari." I had heard that word from Maris as a
  term of abuse&mdash;he had said, I remember, that it meant men who become
  beasts, like the ancient Centaurs. I guessed that this fellow must be one of
  the mountain men who were now in league with their old enemies of the coast.
  If they were among the besiegers, Kor&eacute; could no longer refuse our
  help. "I will hire a regiment to shoot them down," she had furiously told me.
  But what good was <i>our</i> help likely to be?</p>

  <p>The sight of that fellow put an edge to my discomfort, and before the
  shadows had begun to fall I was roaming about the little room like a cat in a
  cage. The priest left me, and presently I heard the ringing of a bell. In the
  quiet, now deepened by the hush of twilight, the homely sound seemed a
  mockery&mdash;like the striking of the bells of a naval battery I once heard
  on the Yser. Then, in the midst of mud and death, it had incongruously
  suggested tea on the cool deck of a liner; now this tintinnabulation, with
  its call to a meek worship, had the same grotesque note of parody. Clearly
  there were no worshippers. I went to the back of the cottage, and from the
  window of the bare little bedroom had a view of the church in that amethyst
  gloaming. It was a baroque edifice, probably five centuries old, but
  renovated during the last fifty years, and in part painted a violent red.
  Beside it was a tiny bell-tower, obviously far more ancient. I could see a
  faint light in the window, and beyond that a dark clump of ilex above which
  the evening star was rising.</p>

  <p>When the priest returned it was almost dark. He lit a lamp and carefully
  locked the door and shuttered the window. His barren service seemed to weigh
  heavily on him, for he moved wearily and did not raise his long-lidded eyes.
  It was borne in on me that at any price I must find some means of
  communicating with him, for my hour of action was approaching.</p>

  <p>I tried him in French, but he never lifted his head.</p>

  <p>Then it occurred to me that even a priest of the Greek Church must know a
  little Latin. I used the English pronunciation, and though he did not
  understand me, he seemed to realize what tongue I was talking, for he replied
  in a slow, broad Latin. I could not follow it, but at any rate we had found a
  common speech. I tore a page from my notebook and was about to write, when he
  snatched it and the pencil from my hand. There was something he badly wanted
  to say to me. He hesitated a good deal, and then in laborious capitals he
  wrote:</p>

  <p><font size="1"
        style="font-weight: bold;">SI POPULUS ALIQUID PERICULI TIBI MINATUR,
        INVENIES REFUGIUM IN ECCLESIA</font></p>

  <p>Then he scored out <font size="1"
        style="font-weight: bold;">"REFUGIUM"</font> and wrote in <font size=
        "1"
        style="font-weight: bold;">"SANCTUARIUM."</font></p>

  <p><font size="1"
        style="font-weight: bold;">"QUID PERICULI?"</font> I wrote.</p>

  <p>He looked at me helplessly, and spread out his hands. Danger, he seemed to
  suggest, lay in every quarter of the compass.</p>

  <p>We used up five pages in a conversation in the doggiest kind of style. My
  Latin was chiefly of the legal type, and I often used a word that puzzled
  him, while he also set me guessing with phrases which I suppose were
  ecclesiastical. But the result was that he repeated the instructions he had
  given me through Maris. If I was to enter the House, the only way was by the
  Dancing Floor&mdash;it took me some time to identify "<i>locus
  saltatorum</i>"&mdash;and to climb the great wall which separated it from the
  demesne. But it would be guarded, probably by the "<i>incolae montium</i>,"
  and I must go warily, and not attempt it till the moon was down. Also I must
  be back before the first light of dawn.</p>

  <p>I showed him my pistol, but he shook his head violently and went through a
  pantomime, the meaning of which was clear enough. I was not to shoot,
  because, though the guards were armed, there would be no shooting. But all
  the same I was in some deadly danger. He scribbled in abusive Latin that the
  people I had to fear were "<i>pagani, nefasti, mysteriorum abominabilium
  cultores</i>." If I were seen and pursued my only hope was to reach the
  church. Not his house&mdash;that was no use&mdash; but the church. Twice he
  printed in emphatic capitals: "<i>Pete sanctuarium ecclesiae</i>."</p>

  <p>Then he took me into his little bedroom, and showed me the lie of the
  land. The moon was now up, the fog of the morning had gone out of the air,
  and the outline of the church and the bell-tower and the ilex grove beyond
  might have been cut in amber and jet. Through the trees there appeared a
  faint reddish glow as if fires were burning. I asked what this might be, and
  after a good deal of biting the stump of my pencil he wrote that there lay
  the graveyard, and the lights were burning "<i>ut vrykolakes absint</i>." He
  seemed to doubt whether I could follow his meaning, but I did, for I knew
  about this from Kor&eacute;&mdash;how the peasants kept lamps at the
  grave-heads to ward off vampires.</p>

  <p>He was clear that I must traverse the valley of the Dancing Floor while
  the moon was up, for otherwise I should miss my way. He looked at me
  appraisingly and wrote "You are a soldier," implying, as I took it, that
  there was cover for a man accustomed to use cover. Then he drew a plan on
  which he marked my road. If I skirted the graveyard I should find myself on a
  hillside which sloped towards the Dancing Floor. I must keep this ridge,
  which was the northern containing wall of the place, till I reached the
  boundaries of the House. On no account must I go down into the valley, and
  when I asked why, he said that it was "<i>nefasta</i>." That could not mean
  merely that it was well-guarded, but that it was held in dread by the people
  of Kynaetho, a dread which their priest shared.</p>

  <p>I left the house just after eleven o'clock. Our long, silent sederunt had
  made the two of us good friends, for he wept at parting, and insisted on
  blessing me and kissing me on the forehead. I was on his side, on the side of
  his Church, a crusader going into peril in a strife with heathenish evil.</p>

  <p>It was a marvellous night for scent and colour, but as silent as the deeps
  of the sea. I got with all speed into the shade of the ilexes, and climbed up
  a rocky slope so that I looked down on the village graveyard beyond the
  trees. Dozens of little lights twinkled in it like fireflies, those undying
  lamps which were lit to preserve the inmates from outrage by the terrible
  demons that enter into the bodies of the dead. Suddenly I remembered with
  horror that it was Kor&eacute; against whom these precautions were
  taken&mdash;Kor&eacute;, now because of her crazy gallantry alone in a doomed
  House, dreaming perhaps that she was winning back the hearts of her people,
  and knowing little of the dark forces massing against her out of the
  ancientry of time. There was that in this mania of superstition which both
  infuriated and awed me; it was a thing against which a man could find no
  weapon. And I had the ironic recollection of how little more than a week
  earlier, in a case before the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, I had
  been defending the legalization of certain African rites, on the ground that
  what to one man was superstition might to another be an honest faith. I had
  struck a belief which had the compelling power of a fanatical religion,
  though it was born of the blackness of night.</p>

  <p>The hillside was a mass of scrub and boulder, giving excellent cover, and,
  since the ridge shut me off from the village, I could move with reasonable
  speed and safety. My spirits were rising with the exercise, and the
  depression which had overwhelmed me in the priest's house was lifting. Then
  suddenly I topped a rise and found myself looking down on the Dancing
  Floor.</p>

  <p>It was not a valley so much as an upland meadow, for there was no stream
  in it nor had there ever been one, and, though tilted up gently towards the
  west, most of it was as flat as a cricket-field. There it lay in the
  moonlight, yellow as corn in its cincture of broken ridges, a place plainly
  hallowed and set apart. All my life I have cherished certain pictures of
  landscape, of which I have caught glimpses in my travels, as broken hints of
  a beauty of which I hoped some day to find the archetype. One is a mountain
  stream running in broad shallows and coming down through a flat stretch of
  heather from a confusion of blue mountains. Another is a green meadow, cut
  off like a garden from neighbouring wildernesses, secret and yet offering a
  wide horizon, a place at once a sanctuary and a watch-tower. This type I have
  found in the Scottish Borders, in the Cotswolds, once in New Hampshire, and
  plentifully in the Piedmont country of Virginia. But in the Dancing Floor I
  had stumbled upon its archetype. The moonlight made the farther hills look
  low and near, and doubtless lessened the size of the level ground, but the
  constriction only served to increase its preciousness.</p>

  <p>I sat down and stared at the scene, and in that moment I underwent a great
  lightening of spirit. For this meadow was a happy place, the home of gentle
  and kindly and honourable things. Mildness and peace brooded over it. The
  priest had said that it was "<i>nefasta</i>," but he could only have meant
  that it was sacred. Sacred indeed it must be, what the Greeks of old called a
  <i>temenos</i>, for the dullest could not be blind to the divinity that dwelt
  here. I had a moment of wonder why the Arabins, lords of the island, had not
  included a spot so gracious in their demesne, until I saw that that could not
  be. The Dancing Floor must be open to the winds and the starry influences and
  the spirits of earth; no human master could own or enclose it.</p>

  <p>You will call me fantastic, but, dull dog as I am, I felt a sort of poet's
  rapture as I looked at those shining spaces, and at the sky above, flooded
  with the amber moon except on the horizon's edge, where a pale blue took the
  place of gold, and faint stars were pricking. The place was quivering with
  magic drawn out of all the ages since the world was made, but it was good
  magic. I had felt the oppression of Kynaetho, the furtive, frightened people,
  the fiasco of Eastertide, the necromantic lamps beside the graves. These all
  smacked evilly of panic and death. But now I was looking on the Valley of the
  Shadow of Life. It was the shadow only, for it was mute and still and
  elusive. But the presage of life was in it, the clean life of fruits and
  flocks, and children, and happy winged things, and that spring purity of the
  earth which is the purity of God.</p>

  <p>The moon was declining, but it would be at least two hours before I could
  safely approach the House. The cover was good, I was protected by the ridge
  from the side of the village, and no human being was likely to be abroad on
  the Dancing Floor. I decided that I must get within sight of my destination
  before the light failed and spy out the land. It was rough going among the
  ribs of rock and stone-falls and dense thickets of thorn and arbutus, but
  sometimes I would come on a patch of turf drenched with dew and scented with
  thyme. All the myrrh of Arabia was in the place, for every foot of sward I
  trod on and every patch of scrub I brushed through was aromatic, and in the
  open places there was the clean savour of night and the sea. Also at my left
  hand and below lay the Dancing Floor, lambent under the moon like the cool
  tides of a river.</p>

  <p>By-and-by I came to the end of the ridge, and had a view of the crest
  where the House stood. There was a blur of ebony which must be the wood that
  surrounded it, and bounding it a ribbon of silver-grey. I puzzled at this,
  till I realized that it was the wall of which the priest had spoken&mdash;a
  huge thing, it seemed, of an even height, curving from the dip where the
  village lay and running to what seemed to be the seaward scarp of the island.
  I was now in the danger zone, and it behoved me to go warily, so I found a
  shelter where the cover of the ridge ended and studied the details of the
  scene. The wall could not be less that fifteen feet in height, and it
  appeared to be regularly masoned and as smooth as the side of a house. In
  that landscape it was a startling intrusion of something crude and human, a
  defiance of nature. Shelley Arabin had built it for the sake of his sinister
  privacy, but why had he built it so high? And then I guessed the reason. He
  wanted to shut out the Dancing Floor from his life. That blessed place would
  have been a mute protest against his infamies.</p>

  <p>There was a black patch in the even sheen of the wall. I wormed my way a
  little nearer and saw that for perhaps a dozen yards the wall had been broken
  down. I could see the ragged edges and the inky darkness of the shrubberies
  beyond. This had been done recently, perhaps within the last month. And then
  I saw something more. There were men&mdash;guards&mdash;stationed at the gap.
  I made out their figures, and they seemed to have the baggy white shirts of
  the mountaineer I had seen in the village. Also they were armed. One stood in
  the gap, and the two others patrolled the sides, and I could see that they
  carried rifles at the trail. It seemed absurd that three men were needed for
  that tiny entrance, and I concluded that they wanted each other's company.
  There must be something in the task which put a heavy strain on their
  courage. I noticed, too, that they kept their faces resolutely averted from
  the Dancing Floor. When one moved he walked with his head screwed round
  facing the House. The shining meadow might be <i>nefastus</i>, as the priest
  had said, or it might be too sacred at this solemn hour of night for the
  profane gaze.</p>

  <p>When I had watched them for a little it seemed to me that, though the moon
  had not set, these fellows were too preoccupied to be dangerous, and that I
  might safely continue my reconnaissance. There was not much cover, but the
  declining moon made an olive shadow at the upper end of the Dancing Floor,
  and I proceeded to crawl across it like a gillie after deer. I went very
  cautiously, stopping every now and then to prospect, but I found the wall now
  beyond my range, and I had to chance the immobility of the sentries. My
  breeches were sopping with dew before I reached the point which I judged to
  be out of sight of the gap. The wall, as I had observed, curved at the sea
  end, and once there&mdash;unless there were further guards&mdash;I should be
  at liberty to test my climbing powers. The thing looked a most formidable
  barrier, but I was in hopes that it might be turned where it abutted on the
  cliffs.</p>

  <p>Before I realized it, I was looking down on the sea.</p>

  <p>The coast bent inward in a little bight, and a hundred feet below me the
  water lapped on a white beach. It was such a revelation of loveliness as
  comes to a man only once or twice in his lifetime. I fancy that the short
  commons on which I had subsisted all day and the sense of dwelling among
  portents had keyed me up to a special receptiveness. Behind me was the
  Dancing Floor, and in front a flood of translucent colour, the shimmer of
  gold, the rarest tints of sapphire and amethyst, fading into the pale
  infinity of the sky. I had come again into a world which spoke. From below
  came the sound of dreamily moving water, of sleepy pigeons in the rocks.
  Recollections of poetry fleeted through my mind:</p>

  <p class="poem">"...  where Helicon breaks down<br>
  In cliff to the sea... <br>
  <br>
  Where the moon-silver'd inlets<br>
  Send far their light voice&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Yes, but something was wanting. There should have been white flocks on the
  sward, something to link up nature with the homely uses of man, in order to
  produce the idyllic. This place was not idyllic, it was magical and
  unearthly. Above me was a walled mystery, within which evil had once been
  followed and a greater evil might soon be done, and there were men with
  quaking hearts bent upon ancient devilries.</p>

  <p>I followed the edge of the scarp as it rose to the highest point where the
  wall ended. There I had a sharp disappointment. The wall ran sheer to the
  edge of the cliff, and a steep buttress descended to the face of the
  limestone crag. The stone was as smooth as a water-worn pebble. I have been a
  rock-climber since I was an undergraduate, and have faced in my time some
  awkward problems, but this was starkly impossible. Even with a companion and
  a rope I do not believe it could have been done, and to attempt it alone
  meant the certainty of a broken neck.</p>

  <p>I prospected eastward along the wall, and found no better hope there. The
  thing was simply not to be climbed except by a lizard. If I had had Maris
  with me I might have stood on his shoulders and made a jump for the coping;
  as it was it might have been a hundred feet high instead of fifteen for all
  the good it was to me. There were no branches about to make a ladder, or
  loose stones to make a cairn&mdash;nothing but the short downland turf.</p>

  <p>The sight of this insuperable obstacle effectively put a stop to my brief
  exhilaration of spirit. I felt small, and feeble, and futile. It was
  imperative that I should get into the House without further delay and see
  Kor&eacute;, and yet the House was as impracticable as the moon, now swiftly
  setting. The rapid darkening of the world pointed out the only road. I must
  dodge the sentries and get through the breach in the wall. It was a wild
  notion, but my growing ill-temper made me heedless of risks. The men had no
  pistols, only rifles, and were probably not too ready in the use of them.
  After all, I had played this game before with success. In the first winter of
  the war, when I was a subaltern, I used to be rather good at wriggling across
  No-man's-land and eavesdropping beside the German trenches.</p>

  <p>I didn't give my resolution time to weaken, but in the shadow of the wall
  made the best pace I could towards the gap. It was now really dark, with only
  a faint glow from the stars, and I moved in what seemed to my eyes
  impenetrable shade after the brightness of the moon. I was wearing
  rubber-soled boots and cloth gaiters, my garments were subfusc in colour, and
  I have always been pretty light on my feet. I halted many times to get my
  bearings, and presently I heard the sound of a man's tread. So far as I could
  judge before, two of the sentries had their patrol well away from the wall,
  and I might escape their notice if I hugged the stones. But one had had his
  stand right in the breach, and with him I would have difficulty. My hope was
  to dart through into the shelter of the thick shrubbery. Even if they fired
  on me they would be likely to miss, and I believed that they would not follow
  me into the demesne.</p>

  <p>I edged my way nearer, a foot at a time, till I guessed by the sound that
  I was inside the beat of the patrols. I had no white about me, for my shirt
  and collar were drab, and I kept my face to the wall. Suddenly my hands felt
  the ragged edge of the gap and I almost stumbled over a fallen stone. Here it
  was very dark, and I had the shadow of the trees inside to help me. I held my
  breath and listened, but I could not hear any noise from within the breach.
  Had the sentry there deserted his post?</p>

  <p>I waited for a minute or so, trying to reckon up the chances. The tread of
  the man on my right was clear, and presently I could make out also the
  movement of the man on my left. Where was the third? Suddenly I heard to the
  right the sound of human speech. The third must be there. There was a sparkle
  of fire, too. The third sentry had gone to get a light for his cigarette.</p>

  <p>Now was my opportunity, and I darted into the darkness of the gap. I was
  brought up sharp and almost stunned by a blow on the forehead. There was a
  gate in the gap, a stout thing of wattles with a pole across. I strained at
  it with my hands, but it would not move.</p>

  <p>There was nothing for it but to bolt. The sentries had been
  alarmed&mdash;probably horribly alarmed&mdash;by the noise, and were drawing
  together. The only safety lay in violent action, for they had a means of
  getting light and would find me if I tried to lurk in the shadows. I raised
  my arms in the orthodox ghostly fashion, howled like a banshee, and broke for
  the open.</p>

  <p>I was past them before they could stop me and plunging down the slope
  towards the Dancing Floor. I think that for the first moments they were too
  scared to shoot, for they must have believed that I had come out of the
  forbidden House, and when they recovered their nerve I was beyond their
  range. The upper slope was steep, and I went down it as Pate-in-Peril in
  <i>Redgauntlet</i> went down Errickstane-brae. I rolled over and over, found
  my feet, lost them again, and did not come to rest till I was in the flats of
  the meadow. I looked back and saw a light twinkling at the gap. The guards
  there must have been amazed to find the gate intact, and were now doubtless
  at their prayers.</p>

  <p>I did not think that, even if they believed me flesh and blood, they would
  dare to follow me to the Dancing Floor. So I made my way down it at a
  reasonable pace, feeling rather tired, rather empty, and very thirsty. On the
  road up I had decided that there was no stream in it, but almost at once I
  came to a spring. It was a yard across, bubbling up strongly, and sending
  forth a tiny rill which presently disappeared in some fissure of the
  limestone. The water was deliciously cold, and I drank pints of it. Then it
  occurred to me that I must put my best foot forwards, for there was that
  trembling in the eastern sky which is the presage of dawn. My intention was
  to join my fellows in the inn courtyard, and meet Maris there in the morning.
  After all, the inhabitants of Kynaetho had nothing as yet against me. All
  they knew of me was that I was a surveyor from the Government at Athens,
  whose presence no doubt was unwelcome but who could hardly be treated as an
  enemy.</p>

  <p>I reached the eastern bounds of the Dancing Floor, and scrambled up on the
  ridge above the ilexes of the graveyard. The lamps were still twinkling like
  glow-worms among the graves. From there it was easy to get into the lane
  where stood the priest's house, and in a few minutes I was in the main
  village street. The chilly dawn was very near, and I thought lovingly of the
  good food in our boxes. My first desire was a meal which should be both
  supper and breakfast.</p>

  <p>The door of the courtyard stood open, and I pushed through it to the barn
  beyond. The place was empty&mdash;not a sign of men or baggage. For a moment
  I thought they might have been given quarters in the inn, till I remembered
  that the inn had no guest-room. I tried the other outbuildings&mdash;a
  stable, a very dirty byre, a place which looked like a granary. One and all
  were empty.</p>

  <p>It was no use waking the landlord, for he probably would not answer, and
  in any case I did not understand his tongue. There was nothing for it but to
  go back to the priest. My temper was thoroughly embittered, and I strode out
  of the courtyard as if I were at home in my own village.</p>

  <p>But my entrance had been observed, and the street was full of people. I
  doubt if Kynaetho slept much these days, and now it seemed that from every
  door men and women were emerging. There was something uncanny in that violent
  vigilance in the cold grey light of dawn. And the crowd was no longer inert.
  In a second I saw that it was actively hostile, that it wanted to do me a
  mischief, or at any rate to lay hands on me. It closed in on me from every
  side, and yet made no sound.</p>

  <p>It was now that I had my first real taste of fear. Before I had been
  troubled and mystified, but now I was downright afraid. Automatically I broke
  into a run, for I remembered the priest's advice about the church.</p>

  <p>My action took them by surprise. Shouts arose, meaningless shouts to me,
  and I broke through the immediate circle with ease. Two fellows who moved to
  intercept me I handed off in the best Rugby football style. The street was
  empty before me and I sprinted up it at a pace which I doubt if I ever
  equalled in my old running days.</p>

  <p>But I had one determined pursuer. I caught a glimpse of him out of a
  corner of my eye, one of the young men from the hills, a fellow with a dark
  hawk-like face and a powerful raking stride. In my then form he would have
  beaten me easily if the course had been longer, but it was too short to let
  him develop his speed. Yet he was not a yard behind me when I shot through
  the open door of the church.</p>

  <p>I flung myself gasping on the floor behind one of the squat pillars. As I
  recovered my breath I wondered why no shot had been fired. A man with a gun
  could have brought me down with the utmost ease, for I had been running
  straight in the open. My second thought was that the priest had been right.
  The peasant had stopped in his tracks at the church door. I had found safety
  for the moment&mdash;a sanctuary or, it might be, a prison.</p><br>
 <br>

  <h2><a name="chap10"
     id="chap10">CHAPTER 10</a></h2>

  <p>The morning light was filtering through the windows, and since the glass
  was a dirty yellow, the place seemed still to be full of moonshine. As my
  eyes grew accustomed to it, I made out the features of the interior. A heavy
  curtain separated the sanctuary from the chancel; the floor was of rough
  stone, worn with the feet and knees of generations of worshippers; there were
  none of the statues and images which one is accustomed to in a Roman church,
  not even a crucifix, though there may have been one above the hidden altar.
  From a pillar hung an assortment of votive offerings, crutches, oar-blades,
  rudders of ships, old-fashioned horn spectacles. The walls were studded with
  little ikons of saints, each one with its guttering lamp before it. The place
  smelt dank and unused and mouldy, like a kirk in winter-time in some Highland
  glen. Behind me the open door showed an oval of pure pale light.</p>

  <p>I was in a mood of profound despondency which was very near despair. The
  men had gone and with them our stores of food and ammunition. God knew where
  Maris was or how I should find him again. The village was actively hostile,
  and I was shut up in the church as in a penitentiary. I was no nearer
  Kor&eacute; than when we landed&mdash;farther away indeed, for I had taken
  the wrong turning, and she was shut off from me by mountainous barriers. I
  could have laughed bitterly when I thought of the futility of the help which
  I had been so confident of giving her. And her danger was far more deadly
  than I had dreamed. She was the mark of a wild hate which had borrowed some
  wilder madness out of the deeps of the past. She had spoken of a "sacrifice."
  That was the naked truth of it; any moment tragedy might be done, some
  hideous rite consummated, and youth and gallantry laid on a dark altar.</p>

  <p>The thought drove me half crazy. I fancy the lack of food and sleep had
  made me rather lightheaded, for I sat in a stupor which was as much anger as
  pity&mdash;anger at those blinded islanders, at my own feebleness, at
  Kor&eacute;'s obstinacy. This was succeeded by an extreme restlessness. I
  could not stay still, but roamed about examining the ill-favoured ikons.
  There was a little recess on the right of the chancel which was evidently the
  treasury, for I found a big chest full of dusty vestments and church plate.
  Sacrilege must have been an unknown crime in Kynaetho, for the thing was
  unlocked.</p>

  <p>Then I noticed a strange object below the chancel step. It seemed to be a
  bier with a shrouded figure laid on it. The sight gave me a shock, for I
  thought it a dead body. Reluctantly I approached it and drew back the shroud,
  expecting to see the corpse of a peasant.</p>

  <p>To my amazement it was a figure of Christ&mdash;a wooden image, rudely
  carved but with a strange similitude of life. It reminded me of a John the
  Baptist by Donatello which I once saw in Venice. The emaciated body was naked
  but for the loin cloth, the eyes were closed, the cheeks sunken. It was
  garishly painted, and the stigmata were done in a crude scarlet. But there
  was power in it, and dignity, and a terrible pitifulness. I remembered
  Kor&eacute;'s story. This was the figure which on the night of Good Friday,
  after the women had kissed and wailed over it, was borne in procession among
  the village lanes and then restored to its sepulchre. This was the figure
  which at the Easter Resurrection stood in a blaze of candles before the
  altar, the Crucified and Risen Lord.</p>

  <p>That sight worked a miracle with me. I suddenly felt that I was not alone,
  but had august allies. The Faith was behind me, that faith which was deep in
  the heart of Kynaetho though for the moment it was overlaid. The shabby
  church, the mazed and ignorant priest took on suddenly a tremendous
  significance...  They were the visible sign and warrant of that creed which
  we all hold dumbly, even those who call themselves unbelievers&mdash;the
  belief in the ultimate omnipotence of purity and meekness.</p>

  <p>I reverently laid the shroud again over the figure, and must have stood in
  a muse before it, till I found that the priest had joined me. He knelt beside
  the bier, and said his prayers, and never have I heard such an agony of
  supplication in a man's voice. I drew back a little, and waited. When he had
  finished he came to me and his eyes asked a question.</p>

  <p>I shook my head and got out my notebook.</p>

  <p>He asked me if I had breakfasted, and when I wrote the most emphatic
  negative which my Latin could compass, he hobbled off and returned with some
  food under his cassock. It was only walnuts and black bread, but I ate it
  wolfishly and felt better for it. I looked on the old man now with a sincere
  liking, for he was my host and my ally, and I think he had changed his
  attitude towards me. Those minutes beside the bier had established a bond
  between us.</p>

  <p>In the recess I have mentioned there was a door which I had not hitherto
  noticed. This opened into a kind of sacristy, where the priest kept his odds
  and ends. There was a well in the floor of it, covered by an immense oaken
  lid, a well of cold water of which I had a long drink. The old man drew
  several buckets, and set about cleaning the chancel, and I was glad to lend a
  hand. I spent the better part of the morning like a housemaid on my knees
  scrubbing the floor and the chancel step, while he was occupied inside the
  sanctuary. The physical exertion was an anodyne to my thoughts, which in any
  case were without purpose. I could do nothing till the night came again.</p>

  <p>On one of my journeys to the sacristy to fetch water I saw a face at the
  little window, which opened on the yard of the priest's house. To my immense
  relief it was Maris, very dirty and dishevelled, but grinning cheerfully.
  That window was a tight fit, but he managed to wriggle half through, and a
  strong pull from me did the rest. He drank like a thirsty dog out of my
  bucket, and then observed that a church had its drawbacks as a resort, since
  one couldn't smoke.</p>

  <p>"I have much to tell you, my friend," he said, "but first I must interview
  his Holiness. By God, but he has the mischievous flock."</p>

  <p>I do not know what he said to the priest, but he got answers which seemed
  to give him a melancholy satisfaction. The old man spoke without ever looking
  up, and his voice was flat with despair. Often he shook his head, and
  sometimes he held up his hand as if to avert a blasphemy. Maris turned to me
  with a shrug of the shoulders. "This madness is beyond him, as it is beyond
  me. It is a general breaking down of wits. What can you and I, soldiers
  though we be, do against insanity? Presently I must sleep, and you too, my
  friend, to judge by your heavy eyes. But first I make my report."</p>

  <p>"I suppose we are safe here?" I said.</p>

  <p>"Safe enough, but impotent. We can take our sleep confidently, but it is
  hard to see that we can do much else. We are in quarantine, if you
  understand. But to report&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He had gone to the inn the night before, and found our five men supping
  and playing cards like Christians. They seemed to understand what was
  required of them&mdash;to wait for me and then join Janni and the others at
  the rendezvous on the western cliffs. So far as he could judge they had had
  no communication of any kind with the people of the village. Then he had set
  out with an easy mind on the road to Vano. No one had hindered him; the few
  villagers he met had stared but had not attempted even to accost him. So over
  the moonlit downs he went, expecting to find Janni and the other five in
  bivouac in the open country towards the skirts of the hills.</p>

  <p>He found Janni alone&mdash;on the roadside some miles east of Vano,
  squatted imperturbably by a fire, in possession of five revolvers and ample
  stores, but without a single follower. From the one-armed corporal he heard a
  strange tale. The party had made Vano before midday in the <i>Santa
  Lucia</i>, had landed, and marched inland from the little port, without
  apparently attracting much attention. He himself had explained to the
  harbour-master that they had been sent to do survey work, and the wine shop,
  where they stopped for a drink, heard the same story. They had then tramped
  up the road from Vano to the hills, stopping at the little farms to pass the
  time of day and pick up news. They heard nothing till nightfall, when they
  encamped beside a village among the foothills. There Janni talked to sundry
  villagers and heard queer stories of Kynaetho. There was a witch there who by
  her spells had blighted the crops and sent strange diseases among the people,
  and the cup of her abominations was now full. So Dionysios had appeared to
  many in a dream summoning them to Kynaetho in the Great Week, and the best of
  the young men had already gone thither.</p>

  <p>That was all that Janni heard, for being the man in authority he spoke
  only with the elders, and they were wary in their talk. But the others,
  gossiping with the women, heard a fuller version which scared them to the
  bone. Your Greek townsman is not a whit less superstitious than the peasant,
  and he lacks the peasant's stolidity, and is prone to more speedy excitement.
  Janni did not know exactly what the women had told his men, except that
  Kynaetho was the abode of vampires and harpies for whom a surprising judgment
  was preparing, and that no stranger could enter the place without dire
  misfortune. There might be throat-cutting, it was hinted, on the part of the
  young men now engaged in a holy war, and there would for certain be disaster
  at the hand of the <i>striglas</i> and <i>vrykolakes</i> in the House, for to
  them a stranger would be easy prey.</p>

  <p>Whatever it was, it brought the men back to Janni gibbering with terror
  and determined to return forthwith to Vano. The island was accursed and the
  abode of devils innumerable, and there was nothing for honest men to do but
  to flee. They would go back to Vano and wait on a boat, the <i>Santa
  Lucia</i> or some other. To do the rascals justice, Janni thought that they
  might have faced the throat-cutting, but the horrors of the unseen and the
  occult were more than they could stomach. Janni, who was a rigid
  disciplinarian, had fortunately possessed himself of their pistols when they
  encamped for the night, and he was now in two minds whether he should attempt
  to detain them by force. But the sight of their scared eyes and twitching
  lips decided him that he could do nothing in their present mood, and he
  resolved to let them go back to Vano till he had seen Maris and received
  instructions. They had already had wages in advance, and could fend for
  themselves till he made a plan. So he doled out to each man a share of the
  supplies and watched them scurry off in the direction of the coast, while he
  smoked his pipe and considered the situation. There, about two in the
  morning, Maris found him.</p>

  <p>The defection of these five men suggested to Maris that the same kind of
  trouble might be expected with the batch in Kynaetho. So he and Janni humped
  the stores and started off across the downs to the rendezvous on the cliffs
  which he had settled with me. That occupied a couple of hours, and there
  Janni was left with orders not to stir till he was summoned. The place was a
  hollow on the very edge of the sea, far removed from a road or a
  dwelling&mdash;a lucky choice, for it had been made at haphazard from the map
  without any local knowledge. Then Maris set off at his best pace for
  Kynaetho, skirting the Dancing Floor on the south, and striking the road to
  Vano a mile or so from the village.</p>

  <p>There he met the rest of our posse, and a more dilapidated set of
  mountebanks he declared he had never seen. So far as he could gather from
  their babble, they had been visited in the small hours by a deputation of
  villagers, who had peremptorily ordered them to depart. The deputation backed
  its plea not by threats but by a plain statement of facts. Kynaetho was
  labouring under a curse which was about to be removed. No doubt the villagers
  expounded the nature of the curse with details which started goose-flesh on
  their hearers. What was about to be done was Kynaetho's own affair, and no
  stranger could meddle with it and live. They may have enforced their argument
  with a sight of their rifles, but probably they did not need any mundane
  arguments to barb the terror which their tale inspired. For they succeeded in
  so putting a fear of unknown horrors into these five Athens guttersnipes that
  they decamped without a protest. They did not even stay to collect some
  provender, but fled for their lives along the Vano road.</p>

  <p>When Maris met them they were padding along in abject panic. One man still
  carried unconsciously a tin from which he had been feeding, another clutched
  a crumpled pack of cards. They had their pistols, but they had no thought of
  using them. Pantingly they told their story, irking to be gone, and when
  Maris seemed to be about to detain them they splayed away from him like
  frightened sheep. Like Janni, he decided that it was no good to try to stop
  them&mdash;indeed he was pretty clear by now that even if they stayed they
  would be useless for the job we had in hand. He cursed their female relatives
  for several generations and speeded the hindmost on his way with a kick.</p>

  <p>His next business was to find me, and he concluded that I would probably
  be still in the neighbourhood of the House. So, as the moon was down, he
  retraced his steps by the south side of the Dancing Floor and reached the
  edge where the wall abutted on the cliffs probably an hour after I had been
  there. He shared my view about the impracticality of an entrance to the
  demesne at that point. As it was now almost daylight he did not dare to
  follow the wall, but returned to Janni on the cliffs, who gave him breakfast.
  He was getting anxious about my doings, for he argued that if I returned to
  the inn to look for the men there would probably be trouble. It seemed to him
  important that the village should still believe him to have gone off, so he
  was determined not to show himself. But he must get in touch with me, and for
  that purpose he decided first to draw the priest's house. He had a difficult
  journey in the broad daylight by way of the graveyard. It would have been
  impossible, he said, if the village had been living its normal life, for he
  had to pass through a maze of little fields and barns. But all farm work
  seemed to have been relinquished, and not a soul was to be seen at the lower
  end of the Dancing Floor. Everybody, except the guards round the House,
  seemed to be huddling in the village street. In the end he got into the
  priest's house, found it empty and followed on to the church.</p>

  <p>I told him briefly my doings of the night. I could see that he was
  completely in the dark as to what was happening, except that Kynaetho, under
  the goad of some crazy superstition, intended very resolute mischief to the
  House and its chatelaine. You see he had not talked to Kor&eacute;&mdash;had
  indeed never seen her, nor had he read the disquieting manuscript which
  Vernon had translated for me. I did not see how I could enlighten him, for on
  that side he was no scholar, and was too rooted in his brand of minor
  rationalism to take my tale seriously. It was sufficient that we were both
  agreed that the House must be entered, and Kor&eacute; willy-nilly
  removed.</p>

  <p>"But we have no ship," he cried. "The lady would be no safer in the open
  than in the House, for they mean most certainly that she shall die. I think
  it may come to putting our backs to the wall, and the odds are unpleasant. We
  cannot telegraph for help, for the office is in the village and it has been
  destroyed. I have ascertained that there is no wire at Vano, or elsewhere in
  the island."</p>

  <p>Things looked pretty ugly, as I was bound to admit. But there was one
  clear and urgent duty, to get into the House and find Kor&eacute;. Before we
  lay down to snatch a little sleep, we made a rough plan. Maris would try the
  coast to the north and see if an entrance could be effected by a postern
  above the jetty where Vernon and I had first landed. He thought that he had
  better undertake this job, for it meant skirting the village, and he believed
  he might pass in the darkness as one of the men from the hills. He could talk
  the language, you see, and, if accosted, could put up some kind of
  camouflage. I was to make for Janni, and then the two of us would try along
  the shore under the cliffs in the hope that some gully might give us access
  to the demesne north of the point where the wall ended. We were to rendezvous
  about breakfast time at Janni's camp, and from the results of the night frame
  a further programme.</p>

  <p>I slept without a break till after eight o'clock in the evening, when the
  priest woke us and gave us another ration of the eternal bread and walnuts. I
  felt frowsy and dingy, and would have given much for a bath. The priest
  reported that the day in the village had passed without incident, except that
  there had been a great gathering in the central square and some kind of
  debate. He had not been present, but the thing seemed to have deepened his
  uneasiness. "There is no time to lose," he told Maris, "for to-morrow is Good
  Friday, and to-morrow I fear that unhallowed deeds may be done." Maris
  discussed his route with him very carefully, and several more pages of my
  notebook were used up in plans. It was going to be a ticklish business to
  reach the jetty&mdash;principally, I gathered, because of the guards who
  watched all the sides of the demesne which were not bounded by the cliffs or
  the great wall. But the priest seemed to think it possible, and Maris's
  Gascon soul had illimitable confidence.</p>

  <p>My road was plain&mdash;up the ridge on the south side of the Dancing
  Floor till it ended at the sea, a matter of not more than four miles. I
  skirted as before the little graveyard with its flickering lamps, and then
  made a cautious traverse of a number of small fields each with its
  straw-covered barn. Presently I was out on the downs, with the yellow levels
  of the Dancing Floor below me on the right. I was in a different mood from
  the previous night, for I was now miserably conscious of the shortness of our
  time and the bigness of our task. Anxiety was putting me into a fever of
  impatience and self-contempt. Here was I, a man who was reckoned pretty
  competent by the world, who had had a creditable record in the war, who was
  considered an expert at getting other people out of difficulties&mdash;and
  yet I was so far utterly foiled by a batch of barbarian peasants. I simply
  dared not allow my mind to dwell on Kor&eacute; and her perils, for that way
  lay madness. I had to try to think of the thing objectively as a problem to
  be solved, but flashes of acute fear for the girl kept breaking through to
  set my heart beating.</p>

  <p>I found Janni cooking supper by his little fire in a nook of the downs,
  and the homely sight for the moment comforted me. The one-armed corporal was,
  I daresay, by nature and upbringing as superstitious as any other Greek
  peasant, but his military training had canalized his imagination, and he
  would take no notice of a legend till he was ordered to by his superior
  officer. It reminded me of the policeman Javert in <i>Les
  Mis&eacute;rables</i>: his whole soul was in the ritual of his profession,
  and it must have been a black day for Janni when the war stopped. Maris, whom
  he worshipped blindly, had bidden him take instructions from me, and he was
  ready to follow me into the sea. Mercifully his service at Salonika had
  taught him a few English words and a certain amount of bad French, so we
  could more or less communicate.</p>

  <p>He had supplies with him, so I had a second supper&mdash; biscuits and
  sardines and coffee, which after two days of starvation tasted like nectar
  and ambrosia. Also he had a quantity of caporal cigarettes with which I
  filled my pockets. Our first business was to get down to the beach, and
  fortunately he had already discovered a route a few hundred yards to the
  south, where a gully with a stone shoot led to the water's edge. Presently we
  stood on the pebbly shore looking out to the luminous west over a sea as calm
  as a mill-pond. I would have liked to bathe, but decided that I must first
  get the immediate business over.</p>

  <p>That shore was rough going, for it was a succession of limestone reefs
  encumbered with great boulders which had come down from the rocks during past
  winters. The strip of beach was very narrow and the overhang of the cliffs
  protected us from observation from above, even had any peasant been daring
  enough to patrol the Dancing Floor by night. We kept close to the water,
  where the way was easiest, but even there our progress was slow. It took us
  the better part of an hour to get abreast of the point where the wall ended.
  There the cliffs were at least two hundred feet high, and smooth as the side
  of a cut loaf. Crowning them we could see the dark woodlands of the
  demesne.</p>

  <p>My object was to find a route up them, and never in all my mountaineering
  experience had I seen a more hopeless proposition. The limestone seemed to
  have no fissures, and the faces had weathered smooth. In the Dolomites you
  can often climb a perpendicular cliff by the countless little cracks in the
  hard stone, but here there were no cracks, only a surface glassy like marble.
  At one point I took off my boots and managed to ascend about twenty yards,
  when I was brought up sharp by an overhang, could find no way to traverse,
  and had my work cut out getting down again. Janni was no cragsman, and in any
  case his one arm made him useless.</p>

  <p>Our outlook ahead was barred by a little cape, and I was in hopes that on
  the other side of that the ground might become easier. We had a bad time
  turning it, for the beach stopped and the rock fell sheer to the water.
  Happily the water at the point was shallow, and partly wading and partly
  scrambling, we managed to make the passage. In the moonlight everything was
  clear as day, and once round we had a prospect of a narrow bay, backed by the
  same high perpendicular cliffs and bounded to the north by a still higher
  bluff, which ended to seaward in a sheer precipice.</p>

  <p>I sat down on a boulder with a sinking heart to consider the prospect. It
  was more hopeless than the part we had already prospected. There was no gully
  or chimney in the whole glimmering semicircle, nothing but a rim of
  unscalable stone crowned with a sharp-cut fringe of trees. Beyond the bluff
  lay the olive-yards which I had seen six years before when I landed from the
  yacht, but I was pretty certain that we would never get round the bluff. For
  the margin of shore had now disappeared, and the cliffs dropped sheer into
  deep water.</p>

  <p>Suddenly Janni by my side grunted and pointed to the middle of the little
  bay. There, riding at anchor, was a boat.</p>

  <p>At first it was not easy to distinguish it from a rock, for there was no
  riding light shown. But, as I stared at it, I saw that it was indeed a
  boat&mdash;a yawl-rigged craft of, I judged, about twenty tons. It lay there
  motionless in the moonlight, a beautiful thing which had no part in that
  setting of stone and sea&mdash;a foreign thing, an intruder. I watched it for
  five minutes and nothing moved aboard.</p>

  <p>The sight filled me with both hope and mystification. Here was the "ship"
  which Maris had postulated. But who owned it, and what was it doing in this
  outlandish spot, where there was no landing? It could not belong to Kynaetho,
  or it would have been lying at the jetty below the House, or in the usual
  harbour. Indeed it could not belong to Plakos at all, for, though I knew
  little about boats, I could see that the cut of this one spoke of Western
  Europe. Was any one on board? It behoved me forthwith to find that out.</p>

  <p>I spoke to Janni, and he whistled shrilly. But there was no answer from
  the sleeping bay. He tried again several times without result. If we were to
  make inquiries, it could only be by swimming out. Janni, of course, was no
  swimmer, and besides, the responsibility was on me. I can't say I liked the
  prospect, but in three minutes I had stripped and was striking out in the
  moon-silvered water.</p>

  <p>The fresh, cold, aromatic sea gave me new vigour of body and mind. I
  realized that I must proceed warily. Supposing there was some one on board,
  some one hostile, I would be completely at his mercy. So I swam very softly
  up to the stern and tried to read the name on it. There was a name, but that
  side was in shadow and I could not make it out. I swam to the bows, and there
  again saw a name of which I could make nothing, except that the characters
  did not seem to me to be Greek.</p>

  <p>I trod water and took stock of the situation. It was the kind of craft of
  which you will see hundreds at Harwich and Southampton and Plymouth&mdash;a
  pleasure boat, obviously meant for cruising, but with something of the
  delicate lines of a racer. I was beginning to feel chilly, and felt that I
  must do something more than prospect from the water. I must get on board and
  chance the boat being empty or the owner asleep.</p>

  <p>There was a fender amidships hanging over the port side. I clutched this,
  got a grip of the gunwale, and was just about to pull myself up, when a face
  suddenly appeared above me, a scared, hairy face, surmounted by a sort of
  blue nightcap. Its owner objected to my appearance, for he swung a boathook
  and brought it down heavily on the knuckles of my left hand. That is to say,
  such was his intention, but he missed his aim and only grazed my little
  finger.</p>

  <p>I dropped off and dived, for I was afraid that he might start shooting.
  When I came up a dozen yards off and shook the water out of my eyes, I saw
  him staring at me as if I was a merman, with the boathook still in his
  hand.</p>

  <p>"What the devil do you mean by that?" I shouted, when I had ascertained
  that he had no pistol. "What boat is it? Who are you?"</p>

  <p>My voice seemed to work some change in the situation, for he dropped the
  boathook, and replied in what sounded like Greek. I caught one word "Ingleez"
  several times repeated.</p>

  <p>"I'm English," I cried, "English...  philos...  philhellene&mdash;damn it,
  what's the Greek for a friend?"</p>

  <p>"Friend," he repeated, "Ingleez," and I swam nearer.</p>

  <p>He was a tough-looking fellow, dressed in a blue jersey and what appeared
  to be old flannel bags, and he looked honest, though puzzled. I was now just
  under him, and smiling for all I was worth. I put a hand on the fender again,
  and repeated the word "English." I also said that my intentions were of the
  best, and I only wanted to come aboard and have a chat. If he was well
  disposed towards England, I thought he might recognize the sound of the
  language.</p>

  <p>Evidently he did, for he made no protest when I got both hands on the
  gunwale again. He allowed me to get my knee up on it, so I took my chance and
  swung myself over. He retreated a step and lifted the boathook, but he did
  not attempt to hit me as I arose, like Proteus, out of the sea and stood
  dripping on his deck.</p>

  <p>I held out my hand, and with a moment's hesitation he took it. "English
 ...  friend," I said, grinning amicably at him, and to my relief he grinned
  back.</p>

  <p>I was aboard a small yacht, which was occidental in every line of her, the
  clean decks, the general tidy, workmanlike air. A man is not at his most
  confident standing stark naked at midnight in a strange boat, confronting
  somebody of whose speech he comprehends not one word. But I felt that I had
  stumbled upon a priceless asset if I could only use it, and I was determined
  not to let the chance slip. He poured out a flow of Greek, at which I could
  only shake my head and murmur "English." Then I tried the language of signs,
  and went through a vigorous pantomime to explain that, though I could not
  speak his tongue, I had a friend on shore who could. The yacht had a dinghy.
  Would he row me ashore and meet my friend?</p>

  <p>It took me the devil of a time to make this clear to him, and I had to
  lead him to where the dinghy lay astern, point to it, point to the shore,
  point to my dumb mouth, and generally behave like a maniac. But he got it at
  last. He seemed to consider, then he dived below and returned with a thing
  like an iron mace which he brandished round his head as if to give me to
  understand that if I misbehaved he could brain me. I smiled and nodded and
  put my hand on my heart, and he smiled back.</p>

  <p>Then his whole manner changed. He brought me a coat and an ancient felt
  hat, and made signs that I should put them on. He dived below again and
  brought up a bowl of hot cocoa, which did me good, for my teeth were
  beginning to chatter. Finally he motioned me to get into the dinghy and set
  his mace beside him, took the sculls and pulled me in the direction I
  indicated.</p>

  <p>Janni was sitting smoking on a stone, the image of innocent peace. I cried
  out to him before we reached shore, and told him that this was the skipper
  and that he must talk to him. The two began their conversation before we
  landed, and presently it seemed that Janni had convinced my host that we were
  respectable. As soon as we landed I started to put on my clothes, but first I
  took the pistol from my coat pocket and presented the butt-end to my new
  friend. He saw my intention, bowed ceremoniously, and handed it back to me.
  He also pitched the mace back into the dinghy, as if he regarded it as no
  longer necessary.</p>

  <p>He and Janni talked volubly and with many gesticulations, and the latter
  now and then broke off to translate for my benefit. I noticed that as time
  went on the seaman's face, though it remained friendly, grew also
  obstinate.</p>

  <p>"He says he awaits his master here," said Janni, "but who his master is
  and where he is gone he will not tell. He says also that this island is full
  of devils and bad men, and that on no account will he stay on it."</p>

  <p>I put suggestions to Janni, which he translated, but we could get nothing
  out of the fellow, except the repeated opinion&mdash;with which I
  agreed&mdash;that the island was full of devils, and that the only place for
  an honest man was the water. About his master he remained stubbornly silent.
  I wanted him to take me in his boat round the farther bluff, so that we could
  land on the olive-yard slopes and possibly get in touch with Maris, but he
  peremptorily refused. He would not leave the bay, which was the only safe
  place. Elsewhere were the men and women of Plakos, who were devils.</p>

  <p>After about an hour's fruitless talk I gave it up. But one thing I
  settled. I told him through Janni that there were others besides ourselves
  and himself who were in danger from the devils of the island. There was a
  lady&mdash;an English lady&mdash; who was even now in dire peril. If we could
  bring her to the spot would he be on the watch and take her on board?</p>

  <p>He considered this for a little, and then agreed. He would not leave the
  island without his master, but he would receive the lady if necessary, and if
  the devils followed he would resist them. He was obviously a fighting man,
  and I concluded he would be as good as his word. Asked if in case of pursuit
  he would put to sea, he said, "No, not till his master returned." That was
  the best I could make of him, but of that precious master he refused to speak
  a syllable. His own name he said was George&mdash; known at home as Black
  George, to distinguish him from a cousin, George of the Hare-lip.</p>

  <p>We parted in obscure friendliness. I presented him with my empty
  cigarette-case, and he kissed me on both cheeks. As I handed him back the
  garments which he had lent me to cover my nakedness, I noticed a curious
  thing. The coat was an aquascutum so old that the maker's tab had long since
  gone from it. But inside the disreputable felt hat I saw the name of a
  well-known shop in Jermyn Street.</p><br>
 <br>

  <h2><a name="chap11"
     id="chap11">CHAPTER 11</a></h2>

  <p>Janni and I returned to the camp before dawn. For some unknown reason a
  heavy weariness overcame me on the way back, and I could scarcely drag my
  limbs over the last half-mile of shore and up the stone shoot to the edge of
  the downs. I dropped on the ground beside the ashes of the fire, and slept
  like a drugged man.</p>

  <p>When I awoke it was high forenoon. The sun was beating full on the little
  hollow, and Janni was cooking breakfast. My lethargy had gone, and I woke to
  a violent, anxious energy. Where was Maris? He ought to have rejoined us,
  according to plan, before sunrise. But Janni had seen no sign of him. Had he
  got into the House? Well, in that case he would find means to send us a
  message, and to send it soon, for this was Good Friday, the day which the
  priest feared. I was in a fever of impatience, for I had found a boat, a
  means of escape of which Maris did not know. If he was in the House, I must
  get that knowledge to him, and he in turn must get in touch as soon as
  possible with me. Our forces were divided with no link of communication.</p>

  <p>I did my best to possess my soul in that hot scented forenoon, but it was
  a hard job, for the sense of shortening time had got on my nerves. The place
  was cooled by light winds from the sea, and for Janni, who lay on his back
  and consumed cigarettes, it was doubtless a pleasant habitation. Rivers of
  narcissus and iris and anemone flooded over the crest and spilled into the
  hollow. The ground was warm under the short herbage, and from it came the
  rich clean savour of earth quickening after its winter sleep under the spell
  of the sun. The pigeons were cooing in the cliffs below me, and the air was
  full of the soft tideless swaying of the sea. But for all the comfort it gave
  me I might have been stretched on frozen bricks in a dungeon. I was
  constantly getting up and crawling to a high point which gave me a view of
  the rim of the downs up to the wall, and eastwards towards the Vano road. But
  there was no sign of Maris in the wide landscape.</p>

  <p>About one o'clock the thing became unbearable. If Maris was in the House I
  must find touch with him; if he had failed, I must make the attempt myself.
  It was a crazy thing to contemplate in broad daylight, but my anxiety would
  not let me stay still. I bade Janni wait for me, and set off towards the Vano
  road, with the intention of trying Maris's route of the previous night and
  making a circuit by the east side of the village towards the jetty.</p>

  <p>I had the sense to keep on the south side of the ridge out of sight of the
  Dancing Floor and the high ground beyond it. There was not a soul to be seen
  in all that grassy place; the winding highway showed no figure as far as the
  eye could reach; even the closes and barns clustered about the foot of the
  Dancing Floor seemed untenanted of man or beast. I gave the village a wide
  berth, and after crossing some patches of cultivation and scrambling through
  several ragged thickets found myself due east of Kynaetho and some three
  hundred feet above it.</p>

  <p>There I had the prospect of the church rising above a line of hovels, a
  bit of the main street, the rear of the inn, and the houses which straggled
  seaward toward the jetty. The place had undergone another transformation, for
  it seemed to be deserted. Not one solitary figure appeared in the blinding
  white street. Every one must be indoors engaged in some solemn preparation
  against the coming night. That gave me a hope that the northern approaches to
  the House might be unguarded. So great was my anxiety that I set off at a
  run, and presently had reached the high ground which overlooked the road from
  the village to the harbour. Here I had to go circumspectly, for once I
  descended to the road I would be in view of any one on the jetty, and
  probably, too, of the northernmost houses in the village.</p>

  <p>I scanned the foreground long and carefully with my glass, and decided
  that no one was about, so I slipped down from the heights, crossed the road a
  hundred yards above the harbour, and dived into the scrub which bordered the
  beach on the farther side. Here I was completely sheltered, and made good
  going till I rounded a little point and came into a scene which was familiar.
  It was the place where, six years before, Vernon and I had landed from
  Lamancha's yacht. There were the closes of fruit blossom, the thickets, the
  long scrubby ravine where we had listened to the Spring Song. I had a sudden
  sense of things being predestined, of the ironical fore-ordination of
  life.</p>

  <p>I knew what to expect. Round the horn of the little bay where I stood lay
  the House with its jetty and the causeway and the steep stairs to the postern
  gates. My success thus far had made me confident, and I covered the next
  half-mile as if I were walking on my own estate. But I had the wit to move
  cautiously before I passed the containing ridge, and crept up to the
  skyline.</p>

  <p>It was well that I did so, for this was what I saw. On the jetty there
  were guards, and there were posts along the causeway. More, some change had
  been wrought in the seaward wall of the House. The huge place rose, blank and
  white, in its cincture of greenery, but at the points where the steps ended
  in postern doors there seemed to be a great accumulation of brushwood which
  was not the work of nature. My glass told me what it was. The entrance was
  piled high with fagots. The place had been transformed into a pyre.</p>

  <p>But it was not that sight which sent my heart to my boots&mdash;I had been
  prepared for that or any other devilry; it was the utter impossibility of
  effecting an entrance. The fabric rose stark and silent like a prison, and
  round it stood the wardens.</p>

  <p>I didn't wait long, for the spectacle made me mad. I turned and retraced
  my steps, as fast as I could drag my legs, for every ounce of vigour had gone
  out of me. It was a dull, listless automaton that recrossed the harbour road,
  made the long circuit east of the village, and regained the downs beyond the
  Dancing Floor. When I staggered into camp, where the placid Janni was playing
  dice, it was close on five o'clock.</p>

  <p>I made myself a cup of tea and tried to piece the situation together.
  Maris could not have entered the House&mdash;the thing was flatly impossible,
  and what had happened to him I could only guess. Where he had failed I
  certainly could not succeed, for the cliffs, the wall, and the guards shut it
  off impenetrably from the world. Inside was Kor&eacute; alone&mdash;I
  wondered if the old servant whom she had called Mitri was with her, or the
  French maid she had had in London&mdash;and that night would see the
  beginning of the end. The remembrance of the fagots piled about the door sent
  a horrid chill to my heart. The situation had marched clean outside human
  power to control it. I thought with scorn of my self-confidence. I had
  grievously muddled every detail, and was of as little value as if I had
  remained in my Temple chambers. Pity and fear for the girl made me clench my
  hands and gnaw my lips. I could not stay still. I decided once more to
  prospect the line of the cliffs.</p>

  <p>One-armed Janni was no use, so I left him behind. I slid down the
  stone-shoot and in the first cool of evening scrambled along that arduous
  shore. When I had passed the abutment of the wall I scanned with my glass
  every crack in the cliffs, but in daylight they looked even more hopeless
  than under the moon. At one place a shallow gully permitted me to reach a
  shelf, but there I stuck fast, for the rock above could only have been
  climbed by a hanging rope. The most desperate man&mdash;and by that time I
  was pretty desperate&mdash;could not find a way where the Almighty had
  decided that there should be none. I think that if there had been the
  faintest chance I would have taken it, in spite of the risks; I would have
  ventured on a course which at Chamonix or Cortina would have been pronounced
  suicidal; but here there was not even the rudiments of a course&mdash;nothing
  but that maddening glassy wall.</p>

  <p>By-and-by I reached the cape beyond which lay the hidden bay and Black
  George with his boat. It occurred to me that I had not prospected very
  carefully the cliffs in this bay, and in any case I wanted to look again at
  the boat, that single frail link we had with the outer world. But first I
  stripped and had a bathe, which did something to cool the fret of my nerves.
  Then I waded round the point to the place where Janni and I had talked with
  the seaman.</p>

  <p>Black George had gone. There was not a trace of him or the boat in the
  shining inlet into which the westering sun was pouring its yellow light. What
  on earth had happened? Had his mysterious master returned? Or had he been
  driven off by the islanders? Or had he simply grown bored and sailed away?
  The last solution I dismissed: Black George, I was convinced, was no
  quitter.</p>

  <p>The loss of him was the last straw to my hopelessness. I was faced with a
  situation with which no ingenuity or fortitude could grapple&mdash;only some
  inhuman skill in acrobatics or some Berserker physical powers which I did not
  possess. I turned my glass listlessly on the cliffs which lined the bay.
  There was nothing to be done there. They were as sheer as those I had already
  prospected, and, although more rugged and broken, it was by means of great
  noses of smooth rock on which only a fly could move.</p>

  <p>I was sitting on the very boulder which Janni had occupied the night
  before, and I saw on the shingle one or two of his cigarette stumps. And then
  I saw something else.</p>

  <p>It was a cigarette end, but not one of Janni's caporals. Moreover it had
  been dropped there during the past day. Janni's stumps, having been exposed
  to the night dews, were crumpled and withered; this was intact, the butt end
  of an Egyptian cigarette of a good English brand. Black George must have been
  here in the course of the day. But I remembered that Black George had smoked
  a peculiarly evil type of Greek tobacco. Perhaps he had been pilfering his
  master's cigarettes? Or perhaps his master had come back?</p>

  <p>I remembered that he had refused to utter one word about that master of
  his. Who could he be? was he an Englishman? He might well be, judging from
  Black George's reverence for the word "English." If so, what was he doing in
  Plakos, and how had he reached this spot, unless he had the wings of a bird?
  If he had come along the downs and the shore Janni would have seen him...
  Anyhow, he was gone now, and our one bridge with a sane world was broken.</p>

  <p>I made my way back to Janni with a feeling that I had come to the edge of
  things and would presently be required to go over the brink. I was now quite
  alone&mdash;as much alone as Kor&eacute;&mdash;and fate might soon link these
  lonelinesses. I had had this feeling once or twice in the war&mdash;that I
  was faced with something so insane that insanity was the only course for me,
  but I had no notion what form the insanity would take, for I still saw
  nothing before me but helplessness. I was determined somehow to break the
  barrier, regardless of the issue. Every scrap of manhood in me revolted
  against my futility. In that moment I became primitive man again. Even if the
  woman were not my woman she was of my own totem, and whatever her fate she
  should not meet it alone.</p>

  <p>Janni had food ready for me, but I could not eat it. I took out my pistol,
  cleaned and reloaded it, and told Janni to look to his. I am not much of a
  pistol shot, but Janni, as I knew from Maris, was an expert. There would be
  something astir when the moon rose, and I had an intuition that the scene
  would be the Dancing Floor. The seaward end of the House might be the vital
  point in the last stage of the drama, but I was convinced that the Dancing
  Ground would see the first act. It was the holy ground, and I had gathered
  from the priest that some dark ritual would take the place of the Good Friday
  solemnity.</p>

  <p>There was only one spot where Janni and I might safely lie hidden, and at
  the same time look down on the Dancing Floor, and that was in the shadow of
  the wall between the guarded breach and the cliffs. There were large trees
  there, and the progress of the moon would not light it up, whereas everywhere
  else would be clear as noonday. Moreover it was the strategic point, for
  whatever mischief was intended against the House would pass through the
  breach and therefore under our eyes. But it was necessary to get there before
  the moon was fully risen, for otherwise to men coming from the village we
  should be silhouetted against the cliff edge. I cut Janni's supper short and
  we started out, using every crinkle of the ground as cover, much as stalkers
  do when they are fetching a circuit and know that the deer are alarmed and
  watchful.</p>

  <p>We had not much more than a mile to go, and by the route we chose we
  managed, as it happened, to keep wholly out of sight of the Dancing Floor.
  Janni&mdash;no mountaineer&mdash;grumbled at my pace, for I had acquired an
  extraordinary lightness of limb so that I felt as if I could have flown. I
  was puzzled to explain this, after my listlessness of the day, but I think it
  was due partly to tense nerves and partly to the magic of the evening. The
  air was cool and exhilarating, and when the moon rose with a sudden glory
  above the House it was as tonic as if one had plunged into water...  Soon we
  were on the edge of the inky belt of shadow and moving eastward to get nearer
  the breach. But now I noticed something I had forgotten. The wall curved
  outward, and beyond that bulge&mdash;a couple of hundred yards from the
  breach&mdash;the light flooded to the very edge of the stone. We came to a
  halt at the apex of the curve, flat on our faces, and I turned to reconnoitre
  the Dancing Floor.</p>

  <p>I wish to Heaven that I had the gift of words. It is too much to ask a man
  whose life has been spent in drawing pleadings and in writing dull legal
  opinions to describe a scene which needs the tongue or pen of a poet. For the
  Dancing Floor was transfigured. Its lonely beauty had been decked and
  adorned, as an altar is draped for high festival. On both slopes people
  clustered, men, women, and children, all so silent that I thought I could
  hear them breathe. I thought, too, that they mostly wore white&mdash;at any
  rate the moonlight gave me the impression of an immense white multitude, all
  Kynaetho, and doubtless half the hills. The valley was marked out like a
  race-course. There seemed to be posts at regular intervals in a broad oval,
  and at each post was a red flicker which meant torches. The desert had become
  populous, and the solitary places blossomed with roses of fire.</p>

  <p>The people were clustered toward the upper end, making an amphitheatre of
  which the arena was the Dancing Floor, and the entrance to the stage the
  breach in the wall of the House. I saw that this entrance was guarded, not as
  before by three sentries, but by a double line of men who kept an avenue open
  between them. Beyond the spectators and round the arena was the circle of
  posts, and between them lay the Dancing Floor, golden in the moon, and
  flanked at its circumference by the angry crimson of the torches. I noticed
  another thing. Not quite in the centre but well within the arena was a
  solitary figure waiting. He was in white&mdash;gleaming white, and, so far as
  I could judge, he was standing beside the spring from which I had drunk the
  night before.</p>

  <p>I have set out the details of what I saw, but they are only the beggarly
  elements, for I cannot hope to reproduce the strangeness which caught at the
  heart and laid a spell on the mind. The place was no more the Valley of the
  Shadow of Life, but Life itself&mdash;a surge of daemonic energy out of the
  deeps of the past. It was wild and yet ordered, savage and yet sacramental,
  the home of an ancient knowledge which shattered for me the modern world and
  left me gasping like a cave-man before his mysteries. The magic smote on my
  brain, though I struggled against it. The passionless moonlight and the
  passionate torches&mdash;that, I think, was the final miracle&mdash;a
  marrying of the eternal cycle of nature with the fantasies of man.</p>

  <p>The effect on Janni was overwhelming. He lay and gibbered prayers with
  eyes as terrified as a deer's, and I realized that I need not look for help
  in that quarter. But I scarcely thought of him, for my trouble was with
  myself. Most people would call me a solid fellow, with a hard head and a
  close-texture mind, but if they had seen me then they would have changed
  their view. I was struggling with something which I had never known before, a
  mixture of fear, abasement, and a crazy desire to worship. Yes&mdash;to
  worship. There was that in the scene which wakened some ancient instinct, so
  that I felt it in me to join the votaries.</p>

  <p>It took me a little time to pull myself together. I looked up at the dome
  of the sky, where on the horizon pale stars were showing. The whole world
  seemed hard and gem-like and unrelenting. There was no help there. Nature
  approved this ritual. And then a picture flashed into my mind which enabled
  me to recover my wits. It was the carven Christ lying in its shroud in the
  bier in the deserted church. I am not a religious man in the ordinary
  sense&mdash;only a half-believer in the creed in which I was born. But in
  that moment I realized that there was that in me which was stronger than the
  pagan, an instinct which had come down to me from believing generations. I
  understood then what were my gods. I think I prayed, I know that I clung to
  the memory of that rude image as a Christian martyr may have clung to his
  crucifix. It stood for all the broken lights which were in me as against this
  ancient charm&eacute;d darkness.</p>

  <p>I was steadier now, and with returning sanity came the power of practical
  thought. Something, some one, was to be brought from the House. Was there to
  be a trial in that arena? Or a sacrifice? No&mdash;I was clear that to-night
  was only the preparation, and that the great day was the morrow. There was no
  sound from the gathering. I could not see the faces, but I knew that every
  one, down to the smallest child, was awed and rapt and expectant. No crowd,
  hushing its breath in the decisive moments of a great match, was ever more
  rigidly on the stretch. The very air quivered with expectation.</p>

  <p>Then a movement began. Figures entered the arena at the end farthest from
  me&mdash;men, young men, naked I thought at first, till my glass showed me
  that each wore a sort of loin-cloth or it may have been short drawers...
  They aligned themselves, like runners at the start of a race, and still there
  was no sound. The figure who had been standing by the well was now beside
  them and seemed to be speaking softly. Each held himself tense, with clenched
  hands, and his eyes on the ground. Then came some kind of signal, and they
  sprang forward.</p>

  <p>It was a race&mdash;such a race as few men can have witnessed. The slim
  youths kept outside the torches, and circled the arena of the Dancing Floor.
  Over the moonlit sward they flew, glimmering like ghosts&mdash;once round, a
  second time round. And all the while the crowd kept utter silence.</p>

  <p>I ran the mile myself at school and college, and know something about
  pace. I could see that it was going to be a close finish. One man I noted, I
  think the very fellow who had hunted me into the church&mdash;he ran
  superbly, and won a lead at the start. But the second time round I fancied
  another, a taller and leaner man, who had kept well back in the first round,
  and was slowly creeping ahead. I liked his style, which was oddly like the
  kind of thing we cultivate at home, and he ran with judgment too. Soon he was
  abreast of the first man, and then he sprinted and took the lead. I was
  wondering where the finish would be, when he snatched a torch from one of the
  posts, ran strongly up the centre of the Dancing Floor, and plunged the flame
  in the spring.</p>

  <p>Still there was no sound from the crowd. The winner stood with his head
  bent, a noble figure of youth who might have stepped from a Parthenon frieze.
  The others had gone; he stood close beside the well with the white-clad
  figure who had acted as master of ceremonies&mdash;only now the victor in the
  race seemed to be the true master, on whom all eyes waited.</p>

  <p>The sight was so strange and beautiful that I watched it half in a trance.
  I seemed to have seen it all before, and to know the stages that would follow
 ...  Yes, I was right. There was a movement from the crowd and a man was
  brought forward. I knew the man, though he wore nothing but pants and a torn
  shirt. One could not mistake the trim figure of Maris, or his alert,
  bird-like head.</p>

  <p>He stood confronting the beautiful young barbarian beside the spring,
  looking very much as if he would like to make a fight of it. And then the
  latter seemed to speak to him, and to lay a hand on his head. Maris
  submitted, and the next I saw was that the runner had drawn a jar of water
  from the well and was pouring it over him. He held it high in his arms and
  the water wavered and glittered in the moonshine; I could see Maris
  spluttering and wringing out his wet shirt-sleeves.</p>

  <p>With that recollection flooded in on me. This was the ceremonial of which
  Vernon had read to me from Kor&eacute;'s manuscript. A virgin and a youth
  were chosen and set apart in a hallowed place, and the chooser was he who was
  victor in a race and was called the King. The victims were hallowed with
  water from the well by the white cypress. I was looking at the well, though
  the cypress had long since disappeared. I was looking at the King, and at one
  of those dedicated to the sacrifice. The other was the girl in the House...
  Vernon had said that if we knew what the word <i>hosiotheis</i> meant we
  should know a good deal about Greek religion. That awful knowledge was now
  mine.</p>

  <p>It was as I expected. The consecrator and the consecrated were moving,
  still in the same hushed silence, towards the <i>horkos</i>&mdash;the
  sanctuary. The torches had been extinguished as soon as the victor plunged
  his in the spring, and the pure light of the moon seemed to have waxed to an
  unearthly brightness. The two men walked up the slope of the Dancing Floor to
  the line of guards which led to the breach in the wall. I could not hold my
  glass because of the trembling of my hands, but I could see the figures
  plainly&mdash;the tall runner, his figure poised like some young Apollo of
  the great age of art, his face dark with the sun but the skin of his body
  curiously white. Some youth of the hills, doubtless&mdash;his crisp hair
  seemed in the moonlight to be flaxen. Beside him went the shorter Maris,
  flushed and truculent. He must have been captured by the guards in his
  attempt on the House, and as a stranger and also a Greek had been put forward
  as the male victim.</p>

  <p>I was roused by the behaviour of Janni. He had realized that his beloved
  <i>capitaine</i> was a prisoner, towards whom some evil was doubtless
  intended, and this understanding had driven out his fear and revived his
  military instincts. He was cursing fiercely, and had got out his pistol.</p>

  <p>"Sir," he whispered to me, "I can crawl within shot, for the shadow is
  lengthening, and put a bullet into yon bandit. Then in the confusion my
  <i>capitaine</i> will escape and join us and break for the cliffs. These
  people are sheep and may not follow."</p>

  <p>For a second it appeared to me the only thing to do. This evil Adonis was
  about to enter the House, and on the morrow Kor&eacute; and Maris would find
  death at his hands, for he was the sacrificer. I seemed to see in his
  arrogant beauty the cruelty of an elder world. His death would at any rate
  shatter the ritual.</p>

  <p>And then I hesitated and gripped Janni firmly by his one arm. For, as the
  two men passed out of my sight towards the breach in the wall, I had caught a
  glimpse of Maris's face. He was speaking to his companion, and his expression
  was not of despair and terror, but confident, almost cheerful. For an instant
  the life of the young runner hung on a thread, for I do not think that Janni
  would have missed. Then I decided against the shot, for I felt that it was a
  counsel of despair. There was something which I did not comprehend, for
  Maris's face had given me a glimmer of hope.</p>

  <p>I signed to Janni, and we started crawling back towards the cliffs. In
  that hour the one thing that kept me sane was the image of the dead Christ
  below the chancel step. It was my only link with the reasonable and kindly
  world I had lost.</p><br>
 <br>

  <h2><a name="chap12"
     id="chap12">CHAPTER 12</a></h2>

  <p>I had only one impulse at that moment&mdash;an overwhelming desire to get
  back to the church and look again at the figure on the bier. It seemed to me
  the sole anchor in the confusion of uncharted tides, the solitary hope in a
  desert of perplexities. I had seen ancient magic revive and carry captive the
  hearts of a people. I had myself felt its compelling power. A girl whom I
  loved and a man who was my companion were imprisoned and at the mercy of a
  maddened populace. Maris was, like Ulysses, an old campaigner and a fellow of
  many wiles, but what could Maris do in the face of multitudes? An unhallowed
  epiphany was looked for, but first must come the sacrifice. There was no help
  in the arm of flesh, and the shallow sophistication of the modern world fell
  from me like a useless cloak. I was back in my childhood's faith, and wanted
  to be at my childhood's prayers.</p>

  <p>As for Janni, he had a single idea in his head, to follow his captain into
  the House and strike a blow for him, and as he padded along the seaward
  cliffs he doubtless thought we were bent on attacking the place from another
  side. We took pretty much the road I had taken in the morning, skirting the
  Dancing Floor on its southern edge. One strange thing I saw. The Dancing
  Floor was still thronged, though a space was kept clear in the centre round
  the well. Clearly it was no longer <i>tabu</i>, but a place of holiday.
  Moreover the people seemed to intend to remain there, for they had lit fires
  and were squatting round them, while some had already stretched themselves to
  sleep. Kynaetho had moved in a body to the scene of the sacrament.</p>

  <p>When we reached the fringe of the village I saw that I had guessed
  correctly. There was not a sign of life in the streets. We walked boldly into
  the central square, and it might have been a graveyard. Moreover, in the
  graveyard itself the lamps by the graves had not been lit. Vampires were
  apparently no longer to be feared, and that struck me as an ill omen. Keats's
  lines came into my head about the "little town by river or sea shore" which
  is "emptied of its folk this pious morn." Pious morn!</p>

  <p>And then above us, from the squat campanile, a bell began to
  toll&mdash;raggedly, feebly, like the plaint of a child. Yet to me it was
  also a challenge.</p>

  <p>The church was bright with moonshine. The curtains still shrouded the
  sanctuary, and there were no candles lit, nothing but the flickering lamps
  before the ikons. Below the chancel step lay the dark mass which contained
  the shrouded Christ. Janni, like myself, seemed to find comfort in being
  here. He knelt at a respectful distance from the bier, and began to mutter
  prayers. I went forward and lifted the shroud. The moon coming through one of
  the windows gave the carved wood a ghastly semblance of real flesh, and I
  could not bear to look on it. I followed Janni's example and breathed
  incoherent prayers. I was bred a Calvinist, but in that moment I was not
  worshipping any graven image. My prayer was to be delivered from the idolatry
  of the heathen.</p>

  <p>Suddenly the priest was beside me. In one hand he held a lighted candle,
  and the other carried a censer. He seemed in no way surprised to see us, but
  there was that about him which made me catch my breath. The man had suddenly
  become enlarged and ennobled. All the weakness had gone out of the old face,
  all the languor and bewilderment out of the eyes, the shoulders had
  straightened, his beard was no longer like a goat's, but like a prophet's. He
  was as one possessed, a fanatic, a martyr.</p>

  <p>He had forgotten that I knew no Greek, for he spoke rapidly words which
  sounded like a command. But Janni understood, and went forward obediently to
  the bier. Then I saw what he meant us to do. We were to take the place of the
  absent hierophants and carry the image of the dead Christ through the bounds
  of the village. The bier was light enough even for one-armed Janni to manage
  his share. The shroud was removed, he took the fore-end, and I the back, and
  behind the priest we marched out into the night.</p>

  <p>The streets were deathly still, the cool night air was unruffled by wind,
  so that the candle burned steadily; the golden dome of the sky was almost as
  bright as day. Along the white beaten road we went, and then into the rough
  cobbles of the main street. I noticed that though the houses were empty every
  house door was wide open. We passed the inn and came into the road to the
  harbour and to the cottage among fruit trees where I had first made
  inquiries. Then we turned up the hill where lay the main entrance to the
  House, past little silent untenanted crofts and olive-yards, which were all
  gleaming grey and silver. The old man moved slowly, swinging his censer, and
  intoning what I took to be a dirge in a voice no longer tremulous, but
  masterful and strong, and behind him Janni and I stumbled along bearing the
  symbol of man's salvation.</p>

  <p>I had never been present at a Greek Good Friday celebration, but
  Kor&eacute; had described it to me&mdash;the following crowds tortured with
  suspense, the awed, kneeling women, the torches, the tears, the universal
  lamentation. Then the people sorrowed, not without hope, for their dead
  Saviour. But the ordinary ceremonial can never have been so marvellous as was
  our broken ritual that night. We were celebrating, but there were no
  votaries. The torches had gone to redden the Dancing Floor, sorrow had been
  exchanged for a guilty ecstasy, the worshippers were seeking another Saviour.
  Our rite was more than a commemoration, it was a defiance, and I felt like a
  man who carries a challenge to the enemy.</p>

  <p>The moon had set and darkness had begun before we returned to the church.
  Both Janni and I were very weary before we laid down our burden in the vault
  below the nave, a place hewn out of the dry limestone rock. By the last
  flickering light of the candle I saw the priest standing at the head of the
  bier, his hands raised in supplication, his eyes bright and rapt and
  unseeing. He was repeating a litany in which a phrase constantly recurred. I
  could guess its meaning. It must have been "He will yet arise."</p>

  <p>I slept till broad daylight in the priest's house, on the priest's bed,
  while Janni snored on a pile of sheepskins. Since Kynaetho was deserted,
  there was no reason now for secrecy, for the whole place, and not the church
  only, had become a sanctuary. The aged woman who kept house for the priest
  gave us a breakfast of milk and bread, but we saw no sign of him, and I did
  not wish to return to the church and disturb his devotions. I wondered if I
  should ever see him again; it was a toss-up if I should ever see anybody
  again after this day of destiny. We had been partners in strange events, and
  I could not leave him without some farewell, so I took the book of his which
  seemed to be most in use, put two English five-pound notes inside, and did my
  best in laboriously printed Latin to explain that this was a gift for the
  Church and to thank him and wish him well.</p>

  <p>I did another thing, for I wrote out a short account of the position,
  saying that further information might be obtained from Ertzberger and Vernon
  Milburne. Anything might happen to-day, and I wanted to leave some record for
  my friends. I addressed the document under cover to the priest,
  and&mdash;again in Latin&mdash;begged him, should anything happen to me, to
  see that it reached the British Minister in Athens. That was about all I
  could do in the way of preparation, and I had a moment of grim amusement in
  thinking how strangely I, who since the war had seemed to be so secure and
  cosseted, had moved back to the razor-edge of life.</p>

  <p>I have said that there was no need for secrecy, so we walked straight
  through the village towards the harbour. Janni had made a preliminary survey
  beyond the graveyard in the early morning, and had reported that the people
  of Kynaetho were still encamped around the Dancing Floor. The trouble would
  not begin till we approached the House, for it was certain that on that day
  of all days the guards would be vigilant. We were both of us wholly
  desperate. We simply had to get in, and to get in before the evening; for
  that purpose anything, even wholesale homicide, was legitimate. But at the
  same time it would do no good to get caught, even if we succeeded in killing
  several of our captors.</p>

  <p>I think I had a faint, unreasonable hope that we should find the situation
  at the causeway more promising than it had appeared on the day before. But
  when&mdash;after a walk where we had seen no trace of man or beast&mdash;we
  came to the crest of the little cape beyond which lay the jetty and the
  House, I had a sad disillusionment. The place was thick with sentries. I saw
  the line of them along the causeway and at the head of the jetty; moreover
  there seemed to be men working to the left of the House where there was a
  cluster of outbuildings descending to the shallow vale up which ran the road
  from the sea. My glass showed me what they were doing. They were piling more
  straw and brushwood, so that from the outbuildings, which were probably of
  wood and would burn like tinder, the flames might have easy access to the
  windows of the House. The altar was being duly prepared for the victim.</p>

  <p>Long and carefully I prospected the ground. There was cover enough to take
  us down to within a few yards of the jetty. If I tried to cross it I should
  be within view of the people on the causeway, and even if I got across
  unobserved there was the more or less open beach between the causeway and the
  sea. It was true that directly under the wall I should be out of sight of the
  causeway guards, but then again, though I could get shelter behind some of
  the boulders, I could not move far without being noticed by whoever chose to
  patrol the jetty. Nevertheless that was the only road for me, for my object
  was to get to the far end of the causeway, where before the cliffs began
  there were olive-yards and orchards, through which some route must be
  possible to the House.</p>

  <p>I considered the left side of the picture, where the valley led upwards
  past the outbuildings. That way I could see no hope, for if I succeeded in
  passing the fagot-stackers I would only reach the confines of the main
  entrance to the demesne from Kynaetho, which was certain to be the best
  warded of all.</p>

  <p>I had also to consider what to do with Janni. He would be a useful ally if
  it came to a scrap, but a scrap would be futile against such numbers, and in
  stalking or climbing his lack of an arm would be a serious handicap. Besides,
  if our business was to escape observation, one man would be better than two
 ...  But it was possible that he might create a diversion. Supposing he tried
  the road on the left up the valley and made himself conspicuous, he might
  draw off attention while I crossed the jetty and got under the lee of the
  causeway wall. That meant, of course, that one of us would be put out of
  action, but unless we tried something of the kind we should both fail.</p>

  <p>I put the thing to him, as we lay among the scrubby arbutus, and though he
  clearly did not like the proposal, since his notion was to manhandle somebody
  on Maris's behalf, he was too good a soldier not to see the sense of it. He
  pointed out various difficulties, and then shook his head like a dog and said
  that he agreed. For his own sake I forbade any shooting. If he were merely
  hunted and captured, it was unlikely that any harm would befall him. He could
  explain that he was one of the survey party who had lost the others, and at
  the worst he would be shut up temporarily in some barn. He might even find
  the means to make himself useful later in the day.</p>

  <p>So it was settled that I should try to worm my way as near to the jetty as
  the cover would allow. He was to watch my movements, and when he saw my hand
  raised three times he was to march boldly towards the jetty. I would not be
  able to see what was happening, so when he was pursued and started up the
  little valley he was to shout as if in alarm. That would be the signal to me
  that the sentry had left the jetty and that I might try to cross it.</p>

  <p>I started out at once on my first stage. As I have said, the cover was
  good&mdash;boulders overgrown with heath and vines, and patches of arbutus
  and a very prickly thorn. I tried to behave as if I were on a Scotch hill
  stalking alone, with deer where the sentries stood. It was not a very
  difficult passage, for my enemies had no eyes for the ground on my side,
  their business being to prevent egress from the House. After about half an
  hour's careful crawling, I found myself within six yards of the jetty looking
  through the tangle to the rough masonry of it, with a sideway view of the
  point where it joined the causeway. I could see none of the guards, but I
  heard distinctly the sound of their speech. I had marked the spot where I now
  lay before I started, and knew that it was within sight of Janni. So I
  straightened myself and thrice raised my arms above the scrub.</p>

  <p>For a minute or two nothing happened. Janni must have started but had not
  yet attracted attention. I raised my body as far as I dared, but I could only
  see the shoreward end of the jetty&mdash;neither the jetty itself nor any
  part of the causeway. I waited for a cry, but there was no sound. Was Janni
  being suffered to make his way up the little valley unopposed?</p>

  <p>Then suddenly a moving object flashed into my narrow orbit of vision. It
  must be one of the watchers from the causeway, and he was in a furious
  hurry&mdash;I could hear the scruff of his heelless boots on the dry stones
  as he turned a corner...  He must be in pursuit of Janni...  There would no
  doubt be others too at the job. Their silence might be a ritual business.
  <i>Favete linguis</i>, perhaps? If Janni shouted I never heard him.</p>

  <p>I resolved to take the chance, and bolted out of cover to the jetty. In
  two bounds I was beyond it and among the gravel and weed of the farther
  beach. But in that short progress I saw enough of the landscape to know that
  I was undiscovered, that there was nobody on the causeway within sight, or at
  the mouth of the little glen. Janni had certainly been followed, and by this
  time was no doubt in the hands of the Philistines out of my ken.</p>

  <p>I ran close under the lee of the sea-wall, and at first I had a wild hope
  of getting beyond the causeway into the region of the olive groves before the
  sentries returned. But some remnant of prudence made me halt and consider
  before I attempted the last open strip of beach. There I had a view of the
  bit of the causeway towards the jetty, and suddenly figures appeared on it,
  running figures, like men returning to duty after a hasty interlude. If I had
  moved another foot I should have been within view.</p>

  <p>There was nothing for it but to wait where I was. I crouched in a little
  nook between a fallen boulder and the wall, with the weedy rim of the
  causeway six feet above me. Unless a man stood on the very edge and peered
  down I was safe from observation. But that was the sum of my blessings. I
  heard soft feet above me as the men returned to their posts, and I dared not
  move a yard. It was now about two in the afternoon; I had brought no food
  with me, though I found a couple of dusty figs in my pocket; the sun blazed
  on the white wall and the gravel of the shore till the place was like a
  bakehouse; I was hot and thirsty, and I might have been in the middle of the
  Sahara for all the chance of a drink. But the discomfort of my body was
  trivial compared with the disquiet of my mind.</p>

  <p>For I found myself in a perfect fever of vexation and fear. The time was
  slipping past and the crisis was nigh, and yet, though this was now my fourth
  day on the island, I was not an inch farther forward than the hour I landed.
  My worst fears&mdash;nay, what had seemed to me mere crazy imaginings&mdash;
  had been realized. I was tortured by the thought of Kor&eacute;&mdash;her
  innocent audacities, her great-hearted courage, her loneliness, her wild
  graces. "Beauteous vain endeavour"&mdash; that was the phrase of some poet
  that haunted me and made me want to howl like a wolf. I realized now the
  meaning of a sacrifice and the horror of it. The remembrance of the slim
  victor in the race, beautiful and pitiless, made me half-crazy. Movement in
  that place was nearly impossible, but it was utterly impossible that I should
  stay still. I began in short stages to worm my way along the foot of the
  wall.</p>

  <p>I do not suppose that the heat of that April afternoon was anything much
  to complain of, but my fever of mind must have affected my body, for I felt
  that I had never been so scorched and baked in my life. There was not a scrap
  of shade, the rocks almost blistered the hand, the dust got into my throat
  and nose and made me furiously thirsty, and my head ached as if I had a
  sunstroke...  The trouble was with the jetty and the watchers on it, for I
  was always in view of them. Had they detected a movement below the wall, a
  single glance would have revealed me. So I had to make my stages very short,
  and keep a wary outlook behind...  There seemed to be much astir on the
  jetty. Not only the guards, but other figures appeared on it, and I saw that
  they were carrying up something from a boat at anchor. That, I think, was
  what saved me. Had the sentries had nothing to do but to stare about them I
  must have been discovered, but the portage business kept them distracted.</p>

  <p>The minutes seemed hours to my distraught mind, but I did indeed take an
  inconceivable time crawling along that grilling beach, with the cool sea
  water lapping not a dozen yards off to give point to my discomfort. When I
  reached the place where the causeway ceased, and long ribs of rock took the
  place of the boulders of the shore, I found by my watch that it was nearly
  six o'clock. The discovery put quicksilver into my weary limbs. Looking back
  I saw that I was out of sight of the jetty, and that a few yards would put me
  out of sight of the causeway. I wriggled into the cover of a bush of broom,
  lay on my back for a minute or two to rest, and then made for the shade of
  the olive-yards.</p>

  <p>The place was weedy and neglected&mdash;I don't know anything about olive
  culture, but I could see that much. There was a wilderness of a white
  umbelliferous plant and masses of a thing like a spineless thistle. I pushed
  uphill among the trees, keeping well in the shade, with the west front of the
  House glimmering through the upper leaves at a much higher elevation. Above
  me I saw a deeper shadow which I took to be cypresses, and beyond them I
  guessed must lie the demesne. I hoped for a gate, and in any case expected no
  more than a hedge and a palisade.</p>

  <p>Instead I found a wall. There was a door to be sure, but it was no use for
  me, for it was massive and locked. I might have known that Shelley Arabin
  would leave no part of his cursed refuge unbarricaded. I sat and blinked up
  at this new obstacle, and could have cried with exasperation. It seemed to
  run direct from the House to the edge of the cliffs which began about a
  quarter of a mile to my right, and was an exact replica of the wall above the
  Dancing Floor.</p>

  <p>I decided that it was no good trying it at the House end, for there I
  should certainly be in view of some of the guards. The masonry was
  comparatively new and very solid, and since none of the olive trees grew
  within four yards of it, it was impossible to use them as a ladder. Already I
  felt the approach of night, for the sun was well down in the west, and a
  great tide of sunset was flooding the sky. I do not think I have ever before
  felt so hopeless or so obstinate. I was determined to pass that wall by its
  abutment on the cliffs or break my neck in the effort.</p>

  <p>My memory of the next hour is not very clear. All I know is that in the
  failing daylight I came to the cliffs' edge and found an abutment similar to
  the one at the Dancing Floor. Similar, but not the same. For here some storm
  had torn the masonry, and it seemed to me that it might be passed. The rock
  fell steep and smooth to the sea, but that part which was the handiwork of
  man was ragged. I took off my boots and flung them over the wall, by way of a
  gage of battle, and then I started to make the traverse.</p>

  <p>It was a slow and abominable business, but I do not think it would have
  been very difficult had the light been good, for the stone was hard enough
  and the cracks were many. But in that dim gloaming with a purple void beneath
  me, with a heart which would not beat steadily and a head which throbbed with
  pain, I found it very near the limit of my powers. I had to descend before I
  could traverse, and the worst part was the ascent on the far side. I knew
  that, when I at last got a grip of a wind-twisted shrub and tried to draw
  myself over the brink, it needed every ounce of strength left in me. I
  managed it, and lay gasping beside the roots of a great pine&mdash;inside the
  demesne at last.</p>

  <p>When I got my breath I found that I had a view into the narrow cove where
  Janni and I had seen the boat. Black George had returned, and returned
  brazenly, for he was showing a riding light. A lantern swung from the mast,
  and, more, there was a glow from the cabin skylight. I wondered what was
  going on in the little craft, and I think the sight gave me a grain of
  comfort, till I realized that I was hopelessly cut off from Black George.
  What was the good of a link with the outer world when unscalable walls and
  cliffs intervened&mdash;when at any moment murder might be the end of
  everything?</p>

  <p>Murder&mdash;that was the word which filled my head as I pushed inland. I
  had never thought of it in that way, but of course I was out to prevent
  murder. To prevent it? More likely to share in it...  I had no plan of any
  kind, only a desire to be with Kor&eacute;, so that she should not be alone.
  It was her loneliness that I could not bear...  And anyhow I had a pistol,
  and I would not miss the runner. "The priest who slew the slayer and shall
  himself be slain"&mdash;the tag came unbidden to my lips. I think I must have
  been rather light-headed.</p>

  <p>The last fires of the sunset did not penetrate far into the pine wood, the
  moon had not yet risen, and as I ran I took many tosses, for the place was
  very dark. There were paths, but I neglected them, making straight for where
  I believed the House to lie. I was not exact in my course, for I bore too
  much to the right in the direction of the breach in the wall at the Dancing
  Floor. Soon I was among shrubberies in which rides had been cut, but there
  were still many tall trees to make darkness. I thought I saw to the right,
  beyond where the wall lay, a reddish glow. That would be the torches on the
  Dancing Floor, where the people waited for the epiphany.</p>

  <p>Suddenly on my left front a great blaze shot up to heaven. I knew it was
  the signal that the hour had come. The outbuildings had been fired, and the
  House would soon be in flames. The blaze wavered and waned, and then waxed to
  a mighty conflagration as the fire reached something specially inflammable.
  In a minute that wood was bright as with an obscene daylight. The tree trunks
  stood out black against a molten gold, which at times crimsoned and purpled
  in a devilish ecstasy of destruction.</p>

  <p>I knew now where the House lay. I clutched my pistol, and ran down a broad
  path, with a horrid fear that I was too late after all. I ran blindly, and
  had just time to step aside to let two figures pass.</p>

  <p>They were two of the guards&mdash;hillmen by their dress&mdash;and even in
  my absorption I wondered what had happened to them. For they were like men
  demented, with white faces and open mouths. One of them stumbled and fell,
  and seemed to stay on his knees for a second, praying, till his companion
  lugged him forward. I might have faced them with impunity, for their eyes
  were sightless. Never have I seen men suffering from an extremer terror.</p>

  <p>The road twisted too much for my haste, so I cut across country. The surge
  and crackle of the flames filled the air, but it seemed as if I heard another
  sound, the sound of running feet, of bodies, many bodies, brushing through
  the thicket. I was close on the House now, and close on the road which led to
  it from the broken wall and the Dancing Floor. As I jumped a patch of scrub
  and the gloom lightened in the more open avenue, I bumped into another man
  and saw that it was Maris.</p>

  <p>He was waiting, pistol in hand, beside the road, and in a trice had his
  gun at my head. Then he recognized me and lowered it. His face was as crazy
  as the hillmen's who had passed me, and he still wore nothing but breeches
  and a ragged shirt, but his wild eyes seemed to hold also a dancing
  humour.</p>

  <p>"Blessed Jesu!" he whispered, "you have come in time. The fools are about
  to receive their Gods. You have your pistol? But I do not think there will be
  shooting."</p>

  <p>He choked suddenly as if he had been struck dumb, and I too choked. For I
  looked with him up the avenue towards the burning House.</p><br>

  <h3><a name="chap13"
     id="chap13">CHAPTER 13</a></h2>

  <p>This part of the story (said Leithen) I can only give at second-hand. I
  have pieced it together as well as I could from what Vernon told me, but on
  many matters he was naturally not communicative, and at these I have had to
  guess for myself... </p>

  <p>Vernon left England the day after the talk with me which I have already
  recorded, sending his boat as deck cargo to Patras, while he followed by way
  of Venice. He had a notion that the great hour which was coming had best be
  met at sea, where he would be far from the distractions and littlenesses of
  life. He took one man with him from Wyvenhoe, a lean gipsy lad called
  Martell, but the boy fell sick at Corfu and he was obliged to send him home.
  In his stead he found a Epirote with a string of names, who was strongly
  recommended to him by one of his colleagues in the old Aegean Secret Service.
  From Patras they made good sailing up the Gulf of Corinth, and, passing
  through the Canal, came in the last days of March to the Piraeus. In that
  place of polyglot speech, whistling engines, and the odour of gasworks, they
  delayed only for water and supplies, and presently had rounded Sunium, and
  were beating up the Euripus with the Attic hills rising sharp and clear in
  the spring sunlight.</p>

  <p>He had no plans. It was a joy to him to be alone with the racing seas and
  the dancing winds, to scud past the little headlands, pink and white with
  blossom, or to lie of a night in some hidden bay beneath the thymy crags. He
  had discarded the clothes of civilization. In a blue jersey and old corduroy
  trousers, bareheaded and barefooted, he steered his craft and waited on the
  passing of the hours. His mood, he has told me, was one of complete
  happiness, unshadowed by nervousness or doubt. The long preparation was
  almost at an end. Like an acolyte before a temple gate, he believed himself
  to be on the threshold of a new life. He had that sense of unseen hands which
  comes to all men once or twice in their lives, and both hope and fear were
  swallowed up in a calm expectancy.</p>

  <p>Trouble began under the snows of Pelion as they turned the north end of
  Euboea. On the morning of the first Monday in April the light winds died
  away, and foul weather came out of the northwest. By midday it was half a
  gale, and in those yeasty shallow seas, with an iron coast to port and
  starboard, their position was dangerous. The nearest harbour was twenty miles
  distant, and neither of the crew had ever been there before. With the evening
  the gale increased, and it was decided to get out of that maze of rocky
  islands to the safer deeps of the Aegean.</p>

  <p>It was a hard night for the two of them, and there was no chance of sleep.
  More by luck than skill they escaped the butt of Skiathos, and the first
  light found them far to the south-east among the long tides of the North
  Aegean. They ran close-reefed before the gale, and all morning with decks
  awash nosed and plunged in seas which might have been the wintry Atlantic. It
  was not till the afternoon that the gale seemed to blow itself out and two
  soaked and chilly mortals could relax their vigil. Soon bacon was frizzling
  on the cuddy-stove, and hot coffee and dry clothes restored them to moderate
  comfort.</p>

  <p>The sky cleared, and in bright sunlight, with the dregs of the gale behind
  him, Vernon steered for the nearest land, an island of which he did not
  trouble to read the name, but which the chart showed to possess good
  anchorage. Late in the evening, when the light was growing dim, they came
  into a little bay carved from the side of a hill. They also came into fog.
  The wind had dropped utterly, and the land which they saw was only an outline
  in the haze. When they cast anchor the fog was rolling like a tide over the
  sea, and muffling their yards. They spent a busy hour or two, repairing the
  damage of the storm, and then the two of them made such a meal as befits
  those who have faced danger together. Afterwards Vernon, as his custom was,
  sat alone in the stern, smoking and thinking his thoughts. He wrote up his
  diary with a ship's lantern beside him, while the mist hung about him low and
  soft as an awning.</p>

  <p>He had leisure now for the thought which had all day been at the back of
  his mind. The night&mdash;the great night&mdash; had passed and there had
  been no dream. The adventure for which all his life he had been preparing
  himself had vanished into the Aegean tides. The hour when the revelation
  should have come had been spent in battling with the storm, when a man lives
  in the minute at grips with too urgent realities.</p>

  <p>His first mood was one of dismal relaxedness. He felt as useless as an
  unstrung bow. I, the only man to whom he had ever confided his secret, had
  been right, and the long vigil had ended in fiasco. He tried to tell himself
  that it was a relief, that an old folly was over, but he knew that deep down
  in his heart there was bitter disappointment. The fates had prepared the
  stage, and rung up the curtain, and lo! there was no play. He had been
  fooled, and somehow the zest and savour of life had gone from him. After all,
  no man can be strung high and then find his preparations idle without
  suffering a cruel recoil.</p>

  <p>And then anger came to stiffen him&mdash;anger at himself. What a
  God-forsaken ass he had been, frittering away his best years in following a
  phantom!...  In his revulsion he loathed the dream which he had cherished so
  long. He began to explain it away with the common sense which on my lips he
  had accounted blasphemy...  The regular seasonal occurrence was his own
  doing&mdash;he had expected it and it had come&mdash;a mere case of
  subjective compulsion...  The fact that each year the revelation had moved
  one room nearer was also the result of his willing it to be so, for
  subconsciously he must have desired to hasten the consummation...  He went
  through every detail, obstinately providing some rationalistic explanation
  for each. I do not think he can have satisfied himself, but he was in the
  mood to deface his idols, and one feeling surged above all others&mdash;that
  he was done with fancies now and for ever. He has told me that the thing he
  longed for chiefly at that moment was to have me beside him that he might
  make formal recantation.</p>

  <p>By-and-by he argued himself into some philosophy. He had dallied certain
  years, but he was still young, and the world was before him. He had kept his
  body and mind in hard training, and that at any rate was not wasted, though
  the primal purpose had gone. He was a normal man now among normal men, and it
  was his business to prove himself. He thought in his Calvinistic way that the
  bogus vision might have been sent to him for a purpose&mdash;the thing might
  be hallucination, but the <i>askesis</i> which it had entailed was solid gain
 ...  He fetched from his locker the little book in which he had chronicled his
  inner life, and wrote in it "Finis." Then he locked it and flung the key
  overboard. The volume would be kept at Severns to remind him of his folly,
  but it would never be opened by him.</p>

  <p>By this time he was his own master again. He would sail for England next
  morning and get hold of me and make a plan for his life.</p>

  <p>He was now conscious for the first time of his strange environment. The
  boat was in a half-moon of bay in an island of which he had omitted to notice
  the name but whose latitude and longitude he roughly knew. The night was
  close around him like a shell, for the fog had grown thicker, though the moon
  behind it gave it an opaque sheen. It was an odd place in which to be facing
  a crisis... </p>

  <p>His thoughts ran fast ahead to the career which he must shape from the
  ruins of his dream. He was too late for the Bar. Business might be the best
  course&mdash;he had big interests in the north of England which would secure
  him a footing, and he believed that he had the kind of mind for
  administration...  Or politics? There were many chances for a young man in
  the confused post-bellum world... </p>

  <p>He was absorbed in his meditations and did not hear the sound of oars or
  the grating of a boat alongside. Suddenly he found a face looking at him in
  the ring of lamplight&mdash;an old bearded face curiously wrinkled. The eyes,
  which were shrewd and troubled, scanned him for a second or two, and then a
  voice spoke:</p>

  <p>"Will the Signor come with me?" it said in French.</p>

  <p>Vernon, amazed at this apparition, which had come out of the mist, could
  only stare.</p>

  <p>"Will the Signor come with me?" the voice spoke again. "We have grievous
  need of a man."</p>

  <p>Vernon unconsciously spoke not in French but in Greek.</p>

  <p>"Who the devil are you, and where do you come from?"</p>

  <p>"I come from the House. I saw you enter the bay before the fog fell. Had
  there been no fog, they would not have let me come to you."</p>

  <p>"Who are 'they'?" Vernon asked.</p>

  <p>But the old man shook his head. "Come with me and I will tell you. It is a
  long story."</p>

  <p>"But what do you want me to do? Confound it, I'm not going off with a man
  I never saw before who can't tell me what he wants."</p>

  <p>The old man shrugged his shoulders despairingly. "I have no words," he
  said. "But Mademoiselle &Eacute;lise is waiting at the jetty. Come to her at
  any rate and she will reason with you."</p>

  <p>Vernon&mdash;as you will admit, if I have made his character at all clear
  to you&mdash;had no instinct for melodrama. He had nothing in him of the
  knight-errant looking for adventure, and this interruption out of the fog and
  the sea rather bored him than otherwise. But he was too young to be able to
  refuse such an appeal. He went below and fetched his revolver and an electric
  torch which he stuffed into a trouser pocket. He cried to the Epirote to
  expect him when he saw him, for he was going ashore.</p>

  <p>"All right," he said. "I'll come and see what the trouble is."</p>

  <p>He dropped over the yacht's side into the cockleshell of a boat, and the
  old man took up the sculls. The yacht must have anchored nearer land than he
  had thought, for in five minutes they had touched a shelving rock. Somebody
  stood there with a lantern which made a dull glow in the fog.</p>

  <p>Vernon made out a middle-aged woman with the air and dress of a lady's
  maid. She held the lantern close to him for a moment, and then turned wearily
  to the other. "Fool, Mitri!" she cried. "You have brought a peasant."</p>

  <p>"Nay," said the old man, "he is no peasant. He is a Signor, I tell
  you."</p>

  <p>The woman again passed the light of her lantern over Vernon's face and
  figure. "His dress is a peasant's, but such clothes may be a nobleman's whim.
  I have heard it of the English."</p>

  <p>"I am English," said Vernon in French.</p>

  <p>She turned on him with a quick movement of relief.</p>

  <p>"You are English...  and a gentleman? But I know nothing of you...  only
  that you have come out of the sea. Up in the House we women are alone, and my
  mistress has death to face, or worse than death. We have no claim on you, and
  if you give us your service it means danger&mdash;oh, what danger! See, the
  boat is there. You can return in it and go away, and forget that you have
  been near this accursed place. But oh, Monsieur, if you hope for Heaven and
  have pity on a defenceless angel, you will not leave us."</p>

  <p>Vernon's blood was slow to stir, and as I have said, he had no instinct
  for melodrama. This gesticulating French maid was like something out of an
  indifferent play.</p>

  <p>"Who is your mistress?" he asked. "Did she send you for me?"</p>

  <p>The woman flung up her hands.</p>

  <p>"I will speak the truth. My mistress does not know you are here. Only
  Mitri and I saw you. She will not ask help, for she is foolishly confident.
  She is proud and fearless, and will not believe the evidence of her eyes. She
  must be saved in spite of herself. I fear for her and also for myself, for
  the whole House is doomed."</p>

  <p>"But, Mademoiselle, you cannot expect me to intrude uninvited on your
  mistress. What is her name? What do you want me to do?"</p>

  <p>She clutched his arm and spoke low and rapidly in his ear.</p>

  <p>"She is the last of her line, you must know&mdash;a girl with a wild
  estate and a father dead these many months. She is good and gracious, as I
  can bear witness, but she is young and cannot govern the wolves who are the
  men of these parts. They have a long hatred of her house, and now they have
  it rumoured that she is a witch who blights the crops and slays the children
 ...  Once, twice, they have cursed our threshold and made the blood mark on
  the door. We are prisoners now, you figure. They name her Basilissa, meaning
  the Queen of Hell, and there is no babe but will faint with fright if it
  casts eyes on her, and she as mild and innocent as Mother Mary...  The word
  has gone round to burn the witch out, for the winter has been cruel and they
  blame their sorrows on her. The hour is near, and unless salvation comes she
  will go to God in the fire."</p>

  <p>There was something in the hoarse, excited voice which forbade Vernon to
  dismiss lightly this extraordinary tale. The woman was patently terrified and
  sincere. It might be a trap, but he had his pistol, and from an old man and a
  woman he had nothing to fear. On the other hand, there might be some
  desperate need which he could not disregard. It seemed to him that he was
  bound to inquire further.</p>

  <p>"I am willing to go to your mistress," he said, and the woman, murmuring
  "God's mercy," led the way up a steep causeway to some rocky steps cut in a
  tamarisk thicket.</p>

  <p>She stopped half-way to whisper an injunction to go quietly. "They cannot
  see us in this blessed fog," she whispered, "but they may hear us." Then to
  Vernon: "They watch us like wild beasts, Monsieur; their sentries do not
  permit us to leave the House, but this night the kind God has fooled them.
  But they cannot be far off, and they have quick ears."</p>

  <p>The three crept up the rock staircase made slippery by the heavy mist.
  Presently a great wall of masonry rose above them, and what seemed the
  aperture of a door. "Once," the woman whispered, "there were three such
  posterns, but two were walled up by my lady's father&mdash;walled up within,
  with the doors left standing. This our enemies do not know, and they watch
  all three, but this the least, for it looks unused. Behold their work!"</p>

  <p>Vernon saw that tall bundles of brushwood had been laid around the door,
  and that these had with difficulty been pushed back when it was opened.</p>

  <p>"But what...  ?" he began.</p>

  <p>"It means that they would burn us," she hissed. "Now, Monsieur, do you
  believe my tale, and, believing, does your courage fail you?"</p>

  <p>To Vernon, shy, placid, a devotee of all the conventions, it was beginning
  to seem a monstrous thing to enter this strange house at the bidding of two
  servants, primed with a crazy tale, to meet an owner who had given no sign of
  desiring his presence. A woman, too&mdash;apparently a young woman. The thing
  was hideously embarrassing, the more so as he suddenly realized that he was
  barefooted, and clad in his old jersey and corduroys. I think he would have
  drawn back except for the sight of the fagots&mdash;that and the woman's
  challenge to his courage. He had been "dared" like a schoolboy, and after
  twenty-four hours fighting with storms and the shattering of the purpose of a
  lifetime he was in that half-truculent, half-reckless mood which is prone to
  accept a challenge. There was business afoot, it appeared, ugly business.</p>

  <p>"Go on. I will see your mistress," he said.</p>

  <p>With a key the old man unlocked the door. The lock must have been recently
  oiled, for it moved easily. The three now climbed a staircase which seemed to
  follow the wall of a round tower. Presently they came into a stone hall with
  ancient hangings like the banners in a church. From the open frame of the
  lantern a second was kindled, and the two lights showed a huge desolate place
  with crumbling mosaics on the floor and plaster dropping from the walls and
  cornices. There was no furniture of any kind, and the place smelt damp and
  chilly like a vault.</p>

  <p>"These are unused chambers," the woman said, and her voice was no longer
  hushed but high-pitched with excitement. "We live only on the landward
  side."</p>

  <p>Another heavy door was unlocked, and they entered a corridor where the air
  blew warmer, and there was a hint of that indescribable scent which comes
  from human habitation. The woman stopped and consulted in whispers with the
  old man. Now that she had got Vernon inside, her nervousness seemed to have
  increased. She turned to him at last:</p>

  <p>"I must prepare my mistress. If Monsieur will be so good he will wait here
  till I fetch him."</p>

  <p>She opened a door and almost pushed Vernon within. He found himself in
  black darkness, while the flicker of the lantern vanished round a bend in the
  corridor.</p><br>
 <br>

  <h2><a name="chap14"
     id="chap14">CHAPTER 14</a></h2>

  <p>From his pocket Vernon drew his electric torch and flashed it round the
  room in which he found himself. It was the extreme opposite of the empty
  stone hall, for it was heavily decorated and crowded with furniture. Clearly
  no one had used it lately, for dust lay on everything, and the shutters of
  the windows had not been unbarred for months. It had the air, indeed, of a
  lumber-room, into which furniture had been casually shot. The pieces were,
  for the most part, fine and costly. There were several Spanish cabinets, a
  wonderful red-lacquer couch, quantities of Oriental rugs which looked good,
  and a litter of Chinese vases and antique silver lamps.</p>

  <p>But it was not the junk which filled it that caught Vernon's eye. It was
  the walls, which had been painted and frescoed in one continuous picture. At
  first he thought it was a Procession of the Hours or the Seasons, but when he
  brought his torch to bear on it he saw that it was something very different.
  The background was a mountain glade, and on the lawns and beside the pools of
  a stream figures were engaged in wild dances. Pan and his satyrs were there,
  and a bevy of nymphs, and strange figures half animal, half human. The thing
  was done with immense skill&mdash; the slanted eyes of the fauns, the leer in
  a contorted satyr face, the mingled lust and terror of the nymphs, the horrid
  obscenity of the movements. It was a carnival of bestiality that stared from
  the four walls. The man who conceived it had worshipped darker gods even than
  Priapus.</p>

  <p>There were other things which Vernon noted in the jumble of the room. A
  head of Aphrodite, for instance&mdash;Pandemos, not Urania. A broken
  statuette of a boy which made him sick. A group of little figures which were
  a miracle in the imaginative degradation of the human form. Not the worst
  relics from the lupanars of Pompeii compared with these in sheer subtlety of
  filth. And all this in a shuttered room stifling with mould and disuse.</p>

  <p>There was a door at the farther end which he found unlocked. The room
  beyond was like a mortuary&mdash;the walls painted black and undecorated save
  for one small picture. There was a crack in the shutters here, and perhaps a
  broken window, for a breath of the clean sea air met him. There was no
  furniture except an oblong piece of yellow marble which seemed from the rams'
  heads and cornucopias to be an old altar. He turned his torch on the solitary
  picture. It represented the stock scene of Salome with the head of John the
  Baptist, a subject which bad artists have made play with for the last five
  hundred years. But this was none of the customary daubs, but the work of a
  master&mdash;a perverted, perhaps a crazy, genius. The woman's gloating face,
  the passion of the hands caressing the pale flesh, the stare of the dead
  eyes, were wonderful and awful. If the first room had been the shrine of
  inhuman lust, this had been the chapel of inhuman cruelty.</p>

  <p>He opened another door and found himself in a little closet, lined to the
  ceiling with books. He knew what he would find on the shelves. The volumes
  were finely bound, chiefly in vellum, and among them were a certain number of
  reputable classics. But most belonged to the backstairs of
  literature&mdash;the obscenities of Greek and of silver Latin, the diseased
  sidewalks of the Middle Ages, the aberrations of the moderns. It was not
  common pornography; the collection had been made by some one who was a
  scholar in vice.</p>

  <p>Vernon went back to the first room, nauseated and angry. He must get out
  of this damned place, which was, or had been, the habitation of devils. What
  kind of owner could such a house possess? The woman had said that it was a
  young girl, as virtuous as the Virgin. But, great God! how could virtue dwell
  in such an environment?</p>

  <p>He had opened the door to begin his retreat when a lantern appeared in the
  corridor. It was the woman, and with a finger on her lips she motioned him
  back into the room.</p>

  <p>"My mistress is asleep," she said, "and it would not be well to wake her.
  Monsieur will stay here to-night and speak with her in the morning?"</p>

  <p>"I will do nothing of the kind," said Vernon. "I am going back to my
  boat."</p>

  <p>The woman caught his involuntary glance at the wall paintings, and
  clutched his arm. "But that is not her doing," she cried. "That was the work
  of her father, who was beyond belief wicked. It is his sins that the child is
  about to expiate. The people have condemned her, but you surely would not
  join in their unjust judgment."</p>

  <p>"I tell you I will have nothing to do with the place. Will you kindly show
  me the way back?"</p>

  <p>Her face hardened. "I cannot. Mitri has the key."</p>

  <p>"Well, where the devil is Mitri?"</p>

  <p>"I will not tell...  Oh, Monsieur, I beseech you, do not forsake us. There
  has been evil in this House enough to sink it to hell, but my mistress is
  innocent. I ask only that you speak with her. After that, if you so decide,
  you can go away."</p>

  <p>The woman was plainly honest and in earnest, and Vernon was a just man. He
  suddenly felt that he was behaving badly. There could be no harm in sleeping
  a night in the house, and in the morning interviewing its owner. If it was a
  case of real necessity he could take her and her maid off in his boat...
  After all, there might be serious trouble afoot. The sight of those hideous
  rooms had given him a sharp realization of the ugly things in life.</p>

  <p>He was taken to a clean, bare little attic at the top of the house which
  had once no doubt been a servant's quarters. Having been up all the previous
  night, his head had scarcely touched the rough pillow before he was asleep.
  He slept for ten hours, till he was awakened by Mitri, who brought him hot
  water and soap and a venerable razor with which he made some attempt at a
  toilet. He noticed that the fog was still thick, and from the garret window
  he looked into an opaque blanket.</p>

  <p>He had wakened with a different attitude towards the adventure in which he
  found himself. The sense of a wasted youth and defrauded hopes had left him;
  he felt more tightly strung, more vigorous, younger; he also felt a certain
  curiosity about this Greek girl who in an abominable house was defying the
  lightnings.</p>

  <p>Mitri conducted him to the first floor, where he was taken charge of by
  the Frenchwoman.</p>

  <p>"Do not be afraid of her," she whispered. "Deal with her as a man with a
  woman, and make her do your bidding. She is stiff-necked towards me, but she
  may listen to a young man, especially if he be English."</p>

  <p>She ushered Vernon into a room which was very different from the hideous
  chambers he had explored the night before. It was poorly and sparsely
  furnished, the chairs were chiefly wicker, the walls had recently been
  distempered by an amateur hand, the floor was of bare scrubbed boards. But a
  bright fire burned on the hearth, there was a big bunch of narcissus on a
  table set for breakfast, and flowering branches had been stuck in the tall
  vases beside the chimney. Through the open window came a drift of fog which
  intensified the comfort of the fire.</p>

  <p>It was a woman's room, for on a table lay some knitting and a piece of
  embroidery, and a small ivory housewife's case bearing the initials "K. A."
  There were one or two books also, and Vernon looked at them curiously. One
  was a book of poems which had been published in London a month before. This
  Greek girl must know English; perhaps she had recently been in England...  He
  took up another volume, and to his amazement it was a reprint of Peter
  Beckford's <i>Thoughts on Hunting</i>. He could not have been more surprised
  if he had found a copy of the <i>Eton Chronicle</i>. What on earth was the
  mistress of a lonely Aegean island doing with Peter Beckford?</p>

  <p>The fire crackled cheerfully, the raw morning air flowed through the
  window, and Vernon cast longing eyes on the simple preparations for
  breakfast. He was ferociously hungry, and he wished he were now in the boat,
  where the Epirote would be frying bacon... </p>

  <p>There was another door besides that by which he had entered, and curiously
  enough it was in the same position as the door in the room of his dream. He
  angrily dismissed the memory of that preposterous hallucination, but he kept
  his eye on the door. By it no doubt the mistress of the house would enter,
  and he wished she would make haste. He was beginning to be very curious about
  this girl...  Probably she would be indignant and send him about his
  business, but she could scarcely refuse to give him breakfast first. In any
  case there was the yacht...  There was a mirror above the mantelpiece in
  which he caught a glimpse of himself. The glimpse was not reassuring. His
  face was as dark as an Indian's, his hair wanted cutting, and his blue jersey
  was bleached and discoloured with salt water. He looked like a deck-hand on a
  cargo boat. But perhaps a girl who read Beckford would not be pedantic about
  appearances. He put his trust in Peter&mdash;</p>

  <p>The door had opened. A voice, sharp-pitched and startled, was speaking,
  and to his surprise it spoke in English.</p>

  <p>"Who the devil are you?" it said.</p>

  <p>He saw a slim girl, who stood in the entrance poised like a runner, every
  line of her figure an expression of amazement. He had seen her before, but
  his memory was wretched for women's faces. But the odd thing was that, after
  the first second, there was recognition in her face.</p>

  <p>"Colonel Milburne!" said the voice. "What in the name of goodness are you
  doing here?"</p>

  <p>She knew him, and he knew her, but where&mdash;when&mdash; had they met?
  He must have stared blankly, for the girl laughed.</p>

  <p>"You have forgotten," she said. "But I have seen you out with the Mivern,
  and we met at luncheon at Wirlesdon in the winter."</p>

  <p>He remembered now, and what he remembered chiefly were the last words he
  had spoken to me on the subject of this girl. The adventure was becoming
  farcical.</p>

  <p>"I beg your pardon," he stammered. "You are Miss Arabin. I didn't
  know&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I am Miss Arabin. But why the honour of an early morning call from
  Colonel Milburne?"</p>

  <p>"I came here last night in a yacht." Vernon was making a lame business of
  his explanation, for the startled angry eyes of his hostess scattered his
  wits. "I anchored below in the fog, and an old man came out in a boat and
  asked me to come ashore. There was a woman on the beach&mdash;your
  maid&mdash;and she implored my help&mdash;told a story I didn't quite
  follow&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"The fog!" the girl repeated. "That of course explains why you were
  allowed to anchor. In clear weather you would have been driven away."</p>

  <p>She spoke in so assured a tone that Vernon was piqued.</p>

  <p>"The seas are free," he said. "Who would have interfered with me? Your
  servants?"</p>

  <p>She laughed again, mirthlessly. "My people. Not my servants. Continue. You
  came ashore and listened to &Eacute;lise's chatter. After that?"</p>

  <p>"She said you were asleep and must not be wakened, but that I should speak
  to you in the morning. She put me up for the night."</p>

  <p>"Where?" she asked sharply.</p>

  <p>"In a little room on the top floor."</p>

  <p>"I see. 'Where you sleeps you breakfasts.' Well, we'd better have some
  food."</p>

  <p>She rang a little silver hand-bell, and the maid, who must have been
  waiting close at hand, appeared with coffee and boiled eggs. She cast an
  anxious glance at Vernon as if to inquire how he had fared at her mistress's
  hands.</p>

  <p>"Sit down," said the girl when &Eacute;lise had gone. "I can't give you
  much to eat, for these days we are on short rations. I'm sorry, but there's
  no sugar. I can recommend the honey. It's the only good thing in Plakos."</p>

  <p>"Is this Plakos? I came here once before&mdash;in 1914&mdash;in a steam
  yacht. I suppose I am in the big white house which looks down upon the jetty.
  I could see nothing last night in the fog. I remember a long causeway and
  steps cut in the rock. That must have been the road I came."</p>

  <p>She nodded. "What kind of sailor are you to be so ignorant of your
  whereabouts? Oh, I see, the storm! What's the size of your boat?"</p>

  <p>When he told her, she exclaimed. "You must have had the devil of a time,
  for it was a first-class gale. And now on your arrival in port you are
  plunged into melodrama. You don't look as if you had much taste for
  melodrama, Colonel Milburne."</p>

  <p>"I haven't. But is it really melodrama? Your maid told me a rather
  alarming tale."</p>

  <p>Her eyes had the hard agate gleam which he remembered from Wirlesdon. Then
  he had detested her, but now, as he looked at her, he saw that which made him
  alter his judgment. The small face was very pale, and there were dark lines
  under the eyes. This girl was undergoing some heavy strain, and her casual
  manner was in the nature of a shield.</p>

  <p>"Is it true?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"So-so. In parts, no doubt. I am having trouble with my tenants, which I
  am told is a thing that happens even in England. But that is my own concern,
  and I don't ask for help. After breakfast I would suggest that you go back to
  your yacht."</p>

  <p>"I think you had better come with me. You and your maid. I take it that
  the old man Mitri can fend for himself."</p>

  <p>"How kind of you!" she cried in a falsetto, mimicking voice. "How
  extraordinarily kind! But you see I haven't asked your help, and I don't
  propose to accept it...  You're sure you won't have any more coffee! I wonder
  if you could give me a cigarette? I've been out of them for three days."</p>

  <p>She lay back in a wicker chair, rocking herself and lazily blowing smoke
  clouds. Vernon stood with his back to the fire and filled a pipe.</p>

  <p>"I don't see how I can go away," he said, "unless I can convince myself
  that you're in no danger. You're English, and a woman, and I'm bound to help
  you whether you want it or not." He spoke with assurance now, perhaps with a
  certain priggishness. The tone may have offended the girl, for when she spoke
  it was with a touch of the insolence which he remembered at Wirlesdon.</p>

  <p>"I'm curious to know what &Eacute;lise told you last night."</p>

  <p>"Simply that you were imprisoned here by the people of Plakos&mdash;that
  they thought you a witch, and might very likely treat you in the savage way
  that people used to treat witches."</p>

  <p>She nodded. "That's about the size of it. But what if I refuse to let any
  one interfere in a fight between me and my own people? Supposing this is
  something which I must stick out for the sake of my own credit? What then,
  Colonel Milburne? You have been a soldier. You wouldn't advise me to run
  away?"</p>

  <p>"That depends," said Vernon. "There are fights where there can be no
  victory&mdash;where the right course is to run away. Your maid told me
  something else. She said that the evil reputation you had among the peasants
  was not your own doing&mdash;that, of course, I guessed&mdash;but a legacy
  from your family, who for very good reasons were unpopular. Does that make no
  difference?"</p>

  <p>"How?"</p>

  <p>"Why, there's surely no obligation in honour to make yourself a vicarious
  sacrifice for other people's misdeeds!"</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;don't&mdash;think I agree. One must pay for one's race as well as
  for oneself."</p>

  <p>"Oh, nonsense! Not the kind of thing your family seem to have amused
  themselves with."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"I was put into a room last night"&mdash;Vernon spoke
  hesitatingly&mdash;"and I saw some books and paintings. They were horrible. I
  understood&mdash;well, that the peasants might have a good deal of
  reason&mdash;something to say for themselves, you know. Why should you suffer
  for that swinishness?"</p>

  <p>The morning sun had broken through the fog and was shining full on the
  girl's face. She sprang to her feet, and Vernon saw that she had blushed
  deeply.</p>

  <p>"You entered those rooms!" she cried. "That fool &Eacute;lise! I will have
  her beaten. Oh, I am shamed...  Get off with you! You are only making me
  wretched. Get off while there's time."</p>

  <p>The sight of her crimson face and neck moved Vernon to a deep
  compassion.</p>

  <p>"I refuse to leave without you, Miss Arabin," he said. "I do not know
  much, but I know enough to see that you are in deadly danger. I can no more
  leave you here than I could leave a drowning child in the sea. Quick! Get
  your maid and pack some things and we'll be gone."</p>

  <p>She stood before him, an abashed, obstinate child.</p>

  <p>"I won't go...  I hate you...  You have seen&mdash;oh, leave me, if you
  have any pity."</p>

  <p>"You come with me."</p>

  <p>"I won't!" Her lips were a thin line, and the shut jaws made a square of
  the resolute little face.</p>

  <p>"Then I shall carry you off. I'm very sorry, Miss Arabin, but I'm going to
  save you in spite of yourself."</p>

  <p>Vernon had his hand stretched out to the silver handbell to summon
  &Eacute;lise, when he found himself looking at a small pistol. He caught her
  wrist, expecting it to go off, but nothing happened. It dropped into his
  hand, and he saw that it was unloaded.</p>

  <p>He rang the bell.</p>

  <p>"All the more reason why you should come with me if you are so badly
  armed."</p>

  <p>The girl stood stiff and silent, her eyes and cheeks burning, as
  &Eacute;lise entered.</p>

  <p>"Pack for your mistress," he told the maid. "Bring as little baggage as
  possible, for there isn't much room." The woman hurried off gladly to do his
  bidding.</p>

  <p>"Please don't make a scene," he said. "You will have to come in the end,
  and some day you will forgive me."</p>

  <p>"I will not come," she said, "but I will show you something."</p>

  <p>Life seemed to have been restored to her tense body, as she hurried him
  out of the room, along a corridor, and up a flight of stairs to a window
  which looked seaward.</p>

  <p>The last wreath of fog had disappeared, and the half-moon of bay lay blue
  and sparkling. Down at the jetty were men and boats, but out on the water
  there was no sign of the anchored yacht.</p>

  <p>"What does that mean?" Vernon cried.</p>

  <p>"It means that your boat has gone. When the air cleared the people saw it,
  and have driven your man away...  It means that you, like me, are a
  prisoner!"</p><br>
 <br>

  <h2><a name="chap15"
     id="chap15">CHAPTER 15</a></h2>

  <p>As Vernon looked at the flushed girl, whose voice as she spoke had at
  least as much consternation in it as triumph, he experienced a sudden
  dislocation of mind. Something fell from him&mdash;the elderliness, the
  preoccupation, the stiff dogma of his recent years. He recaptured the spirit
  which had open arms for novelty. He felt an eagerness to be up and
  doing&mdash; what, he was not clear&mdash;but something difficult and
  high-handed. The vanishing of his dream had left the chambers of his mind
  swept and garnished, and youth does not tolerate empty rooms.</p>

  <p>Also, though I do not think that he had yet begun to fall in love with
  Kor&eacute;, he understood the quality of one whom aforetimes he had disliked
  both as individual and type. This pale girl, dressed like a young woman in a
  Scotch shooting lodge, was facing terror with a stiff lip. There was nothing
  raffish or second-rate about her now. She might make light of her danger in
  her words, but her eyes betrayed her.</p>

  <p>It was about this danger that he was still undecided. You see, he had not,
  like me, seen the people of the island, felt the strain of their expectancy,
  or looked on the secret spaces of the Dancing Floor. He had come out of the
  storm to hear a tale told in the fog and darkness by an excited woman. That
  was all&mdash; that and the hideous rooms at which he had had a passing
  glance. The atmosphere of the place, which I had found so unnerving, had not
  yet begun to affect him.</p>

  <p>"My fellow will come back," he said, after scanning the empty seas. "He
  has his faults, but he is plucky and faithful."</p>

  <p>"You do not understand," the girl said. "He would be one against a
  thousand. He may be as brave as a lion, but they won't let him anchor, and if
  they did they would never let you and me join him. I have told you we are
  prisoners&mdash;close prisoners."</p>

  <p>"You must tell me a great deal more. You see, you can't refuse my help
  now, for we are in the same boat. Do you mind if we go back to where we
  breakfasted, for I left my pipe there."</p>

  <p>She turned without a word and led him back to her sitting-room, passing a
  woe-begone &Eacute;lise who, with her arms full of clothes, was told that her
  services were now needless. The windows of the room looked on a garden which
  had been suffered to run wild but which still showed a wealth of spring
  blossom. Beyond was a shallow terrace and then the darkness of trees. A man's
  head seemed to move behind a cypress hedge. The girl nodded towards it. "One
  of my gaolers," she said.</p>

  <p>She stood looking out of the window with her eyes averted from Vernon, and
  seemed to be forcing herself to speak.</p>

  <p>"You have guessed right about my family," she said. "And about this house.
  I am cleaning it slowly&mdash;I must do it myself, &Eacute;lise and I, for I
  do not want strangers to know...  This room was as bad as the other two till
  I whitewashed the walls. The old furniture I am storing till I have time to
  destroy it. I think I will burn it, for it has hideous associations for me. I
  would have had the whole house in order this spring if my foolish people had
  not lost their heads."</p>

  <p>A "tawdry girl," that was how Vernon had spoken of her to me. He withdrew
  the word now. "Tawdry" was the last adjective he would use about this strange
  child, fighting alone to get rid of a burden of ancient evil. He had thought
  her a modish, artificial being, a moth hatched out of the latest freak of
  fashion. Now she seemed to him a thousand years removed from the feverish
  world which he had thought her natural setting. Her appeal was her extreme
  candour and simplicity, her utter, savage, unconsidering courage.</p>

  <p>"Let us take the family for granted," Vernon said gently. "I can't expect
  you to talk about that. I assume that there was that in your predecessor's
  doings which gave these islanders a legitimate grievance. What I want to know
  is what they are up to now. Tell me very carefully everything that has
  happened since you came here a week ago."</p>

  <p>She had little to tell him. She had been allowed to enter the House by the
  ordinary road from the village, and after that the gates had been barred.
  When she had attempted to go for a walk she had been turned back by men with
  rifles&mdash;she did not tell Vernon how the rifles had been procured. The
  hillmen had joined with the people of the coast&mdash;you could always tell a
  hillman by his dress&mdash;though the two used to be hereditary enemies. That
  made her angry and also uneasy; so did the curious methodical ways of the
  siege. They were not attempting to enter the House&mdash;she doubted if any
  one of them would dare to cross the threshold&mdash;they were only there to
  prevent her leaving it. She herself, not the looting of the House, must be
  their object. Mitri was permitted to go to the village, but he did not go
  often, for he came back terrified and could not or would not explain his
  terrors. No communication had been held with the watchers, and no message had
  come from them. She had tried repeatedly to find out their intentions, but
  the sentinels would not speak, and she could make nothing of Mitri. No, she
  was not allowed into the demesne. There were sentries there right up to the
  house wall&mdash;sentries night and day.</p>

  <p>Vernon asked her about supplies. She had brought a store with her which
  was not yet exhausted, but the people sent up food every morning. Mitri found
  it laid on the threshold of the main door. Curious food&mdash;barley cakes,
  and honey, and cheese, and eggs, and dried figs. She couldn't imagine where
  they got it from, for the people had been starving in the winter. Milk,
  too&mdash;plenty of milk, which was another unexpected thing.</p>

  <p>Water&mdash;that was the oddest business of all. The House had a fine well
  in the stableyard on the east side. This had been sealed up and its use
  forbidden to Mitri. But morning and night buckets of fresh water were brought
  to the door&mdash;whence, she did not know. "It rather restricts our bathing
  arrangements," she said.</p>

  <p>She told the story lightly, with a ready laugh, as if she were once more
  mistress of herself. Mistress of her voice she certainly was, but she could
  not command her eyes. It was these that counteracted the debonair tones and
  kept tragedy in the atmosphere.</p>

  <p>Vernon, as I have said, had not the reason which I had for feeling the
  gravity of the business. But he was a scholar, and there were details in
  Kor&eacute;'s account which startled him.</p>

  <p>"Tell me about the food again. Cheese and honey and barley cakes, dried
  figs and eggs&mdash;nothing more?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing more. And not a great deal of that. Not more than enough to feed
  one person for twenty-four hours. We have to supplement it from the stores we
  brought."</p>

  <p>"I see...  It is meant for you personally&mdash;not for your household.
  And the water? You don't know what spring it comes from?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head. "There are many springs in Plakos. But why does our
  commissariat interest you?"</p>

  <p>"Because it reminds me of something I have read somewhere. Cheese and
  honey and barley cakes&mdash;that is ritual food. Sacramental, if you like.
  And the water. Probably brought from some sacred well. I don't much like it.
  Tell me about the people here, Miss Arabin. Are they very backward and
  superstitious?"</p>

  <p>"I suppose you might call them that. They are a fine race to look at, and
  claim to be pure Greek&mdash;at least the coast folk. The hillmen are said to
  be mongrels, but they are handsome mongrels and fought bravely in the war.
  But I don't know them well, for I left when I was a child, and since my
  father died I have only seen the people of Kynaetho."</p>

  <p>"Kynaetho?" Vernon cried out sharply, for the word was like a bell to ring
  up the curtain of memory.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Kynaetho. That is the village at the gate."</p>

  <p>Now he had the clue. Kynaetho was the place mentioned in the manuscript
  fragment which he had translated for me. It was at Kynaetho that the strange
  rite was performed of the Kor&eacute; and the Kouros. The details were
  engraven on his memory, for they had profoundly impressed him, and he had
  turned them over repeatedly in his mind. He had thought he had discovered the
  record of a new ritual form; rather it appeared that he had stumbled upon the
  living rite itself.</p>

  <p>"I begin&mdash;to understand," he said slowly. "I want you to let me speak
  to Mitri. Alone, if you please. I have done this work before in the war, and
  I can get more out of that kind of fellow if I am alone with him. Then I
  shall prospect the land."</p>

  <p>He found Mitri in his lair in the ancient kitchen. With the old man there
  was no trouble, for when he found that his interlocutor spoke Greek fluently
  he overflowed in confidences.</p>

  <p>"They will burn this House," he said finally. "They have piled fagots on
  the north and east sides where the wind blows. And the time will be Easter
  eve."</p>

  <p>"And your mistress?"</p>

  <p>Mitri shrugged his shoulders. "There is no hope for her, I tell you. She
  had a chance of flight and missed it, though I pled with her. She will burn
  with the House unless&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He looked at Vernon timidly, as if he feared to reveal something.</p>

  <p>"Unless&mdash;?" said Vernon.</p>

  <p>"There is a rumour in Kynaetho of something else. In that accursed village
  they have preserved tales of the old days, and they say that on the night of
  Good Friday there will be <i>panegyria</i> on the Dancing Floor. There will
  be a race with torches, and he who wins will be called King. To him it will
  fall to slay my mistress in order that the Ancient Ones may appear and bless
  the people."</p>

  <p>"I see," said Vernon. "Do you believe in that rubbish?"</p>

  <p>Mitri crossed himself, and called the Panagia to witness that he was a
  Christian and, after God and the Saints, loved his mistress.</p>

  <p>"That is well. I trust you, Mitri; and I will show you how you can save
  her. You are allowed to leave the House?"</p>

  <p>"Every second day only. I went yesterday, and cannot go again till
  to-morrow. I have a daughter married in the village, whom I am permitted to
  visit."</p>

  <p>"Very well. We are still two days from Good Friday. Go down to the village
  to-morrow and find out all about the plans for Good Friday evening. Lie as
  much as you like. Say you hate your mistress and will desert her whenever you
  are bidden. Pretend you're on the other side. Get their confidence...  A
  madness has afflicted this island, and you are the only sane Christian left
  in it. If these ruffians hurt your mistress, the Government&mdash;both in
  Athens and in London&mdash;will send soldiers and hang many. After that there
  will be no more Kynaetho. We have got to prevent the people making fools of
  themselves. Your mistress is English and I am English, and that is why I stay
  here. You do exactly as I tell you and we'll win through."</p>

  <p>It was essential to encourage Mitri, for the old man was patently torn
  between superstitious fear and fidelity to Kor&eacute;, and only a robust
  scepticism and a lively hope would enable him to keep his tail up and do his
  part. Vernon accordingly protested a confidence which he was very far from
  feeling. It was arranged that Mitri should go to Kynaetho next morning after
  breakfast and spend the day there.</p>

  <p>After that, guided by the old man, Vernon made a circuit of the House.
  From the top windows he was able to follow the lie of the land&mdash;the
  postern gates to the shore, the nest of stables and outbuildings on the east,
  with access to the shallow glen running up from the jetty, the main entrance
  and the drive from Kynaetho, the wooded demesne ending at the cliffs, and the
  orchards and olive-yards between the cliffs and the causeway. The patrols
  came right up to the House wall, and on various sides Vernon had a glimpse of
  them. But he failed to get what he specially sought, a prospect of any part
  of the adjoining coast-line beyond the little bay. He believed that his yacht
  was somewhere hidden there, out of sight of the peasants. He was convinced
  that the Epirote would obey orders and wait for him, and would not go one
  yard farther away than was strictly necessary. But he was at a loss to know
  how to find him, if he were penned up in this shuttered mausoleum.</p>

  <p>He returned to find Kor&eacute; sewing by the window of the breakfast
  room. He entered quietly and had a momentary glimpse of her before she was
  conscious of his presence. She was looking straight before her with vacant
  eyes, her face in profile against the window, a figure of infinite appeal.
  Vernon had a moment of acute compunction. What he had once thought and spoken
  of this poor child seemed to him now to have been senseless brutality. He had
  called her tawdry and vulgar and shrill, he had thought her the ugly product
  of the ugly after-the-war world. But there she sat like a muse of meditation,
  as fine and delicate as a sword-blade. And she had a sword's steel, too, for
  had she not faced unknown peril for a scruple?</p>

  <p>"What does Mitri say?" she asked in a voice which had a forced briskness
  in it.</p>

  <p>"I shall know more to-morrow night, but I have learned something. You are
  safe for the better part of three days&mdash; till some time on Good Friday
  evening. That is one thing. The other is that your scheme of wearing down the
  hostility of your people has failed. Your islanders have gone stark mad. The
  business is far too solemn for me to speak smooth things. They have
  resurrected an old pagan rite of sacrifice. <i>Sacrifice</i>, do you
  understand? This House will be burned, and if they have their will you will
  die."</p>

  <p>"I was beginning to guess as much. I don't want to die, for it means
  defeat. But I don't think I am afraid to die. You see&mdash;life is rather
  difficult&mdash;and not very satisfactory. But tell me more."</p>

  <p>Vernon gave her a sketch of the ritual of Kynaetho. "It was your
  mentioning the name that brought it back to me. I have always been interested
  in Greek religion, and by an amazing chance I came on this only a month or so
  ago. Leithen&mdash;the lawyer&mdash;you know him, I think&mdash;gave me a bit
  of mediaeval Greek manuscript to translate, and part of it had this
  rite."</p>

  <p>"Leithen!" she cried. "Sir Edward? Then he found it among the papers I
  lent him. Why didn't he tell me about it?"</p>

  <p>"I can't imagine."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps he thought I wouldn't have believed it. I wouldn't a month ago.
  Perhaps he thought he could prevent me coming here. I think he did his best.
  I had to go off without saying goodbye to him, and he was my greatest
  friend."</p>

  <p>"He happens to be also my closest friend. If you had known about
  this&mdash;this crazy ritual, would you have come?"</p>

  <p>She smiled. "I don't know. I'm very obstinate, and I can't bear to be
  bullied. These people are trying to bully me...  But of course I didn't know
  how bad it was...  And I didn't know that I was going to land you in this
  mess. That is what weighs on my mind."</p>

  <p>"But you didn't invite me here. You told me to clear out."</p>

  <p>"My servants invited you, and therefore I am responsible...  Oh, Colonel
  Milburne, you must understand what I feel. I haven't had an easy life, for I
  seem to have been always fighting, but I didn't mind it as long as it was my
  own fight. I felt I had to stick it out, for it was the penalty I paid for
  being an Arabin. But whatever paying was to be done I wanted to do it myself
 ...  Otherwise, don't you see, it makes the guilt of my family so much heavier
 ...  And now I have let you in for it, and that is hell&mdash;simply
  hell!"</p>

  <p>Vernon had suddenly an emotion which he had never known before&mdash;the
  exhilaration with which he had for years anticipated the culmination of his
  dream, but different in kind, nobler, less self-regarding. He felt keyed up
  to any enterprise, and singularly confident. There was tenderness in his
  mood, too, which was a thing he had rarely felt&mdash;tenderness towards this
  gallant child.</p>

  <p>"Listen to me, Miss Arabin. I have two things to say to you. One is that I
  glory in being here. I wouldn't be elsewhere for the world. It is a delight
  and a privilege. The other is that we are going to win out."</p>

  <p>"But how?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know yet. We will find a way. I am as certain of it as that I am
  standing here. God doesn't mean a thing like this to be a blind
  <i>cul-de-sac</i>."</p>

  <p>"You believe in God? I wish I did. I think I only believe in the
  Devil."</p>

  <p>"Then you believe in God. If evil is a living thing, good must be living
  as well&mdash;more indeed, or the world would smash...  Look here, we've two
  days to put in together. There is nothing we can do for the present, so we
  must find some way to keep our nerves quiet. Let's pretend we're in an
  ordinary English country house and kept indoors by rain."</p>

  <p>So the two of them made plans to pass the time, while the clear spring
  sunlight outside turned Vernon's pretence into foolishness. They played
  piquet, and sometimes he read to her&mdash;chiefly Peter Beckford. The florid
  eighteenth-century prose, the tags of Augustan poetry, the high stilts, the
  gusto, carried their thoughts to the orderly world of home. I have no wish to
  speculate about the secrets of a friend, but I fancy that the slow hours
  spent together brought understanding. Kor&eacute; must have told him things
  which she had kept back from me, for the near prospect of death breaks down
  many barriers. I think, too, that he may have told her the story of his
  boyish dream&mdash;he must have, for it bore directly on the case. With his
  sense of predestination he would draw from it a special confidence, and she
  would be made to share it. He had undergone a long preparation for something
  which had ended in mist, but the preparation might point to success in a
  great reality... </p>

  <p>Late the following afternoon old Mitri returned. Vernon saw him first
  alone, and got from him the details of the next evening's ceremonial. There
  was to be a race among the young men on the Dancing Floor as soon as the moon
  rose, and the victor would be called the King. Some of the news which Mitri
  had gathered was unexpected, some incomprehensible, but in the main it agreed
  with his own version. The victor would choose a victim&mdash;a male victim,
  clearly, for the female victim was already chosen. The two would enter the
  House, and on the next night&mdash;the eve of this grim Easter&mdash;the
  sacrifice would be accomplished. Beyond that Mitri could say nothing except
  that the people looked for a mighty miracle; but the manuscript had told what
  the miracle would be.</p>

  <p>"Who will be the runners?" Vernon asked. "The fleetest among the young
  men, both of the village and the hills."</p>

  <p>It was characteristic of Vernon's fatalism that he had not troubled to
  make even the rudiments of a plan till he had heard Mitri's tidings. Now the
  thing began to unfold itself. The next step at any rate was clearly
  ordained.</p>

  <p>"Will everybody be known to each other?" he said.</p>

  <p>"Faith, no. Kynaetho till now has had few dealings with the hill folk, and
  the villages in the hills are generally at strife with each other. Tomorrow
  night there will be many strangers, and no questions will be asked, for all
  will be allies in this devilry."</p>

  <p>"Do I speak like a Greek?"</p>

  <p>"You speak like a Greek, but like one from another island."</p>

  <p>"And I look like an islander?"</p>

  <p>Mitri grinned. "There are few as well-looking. But if your face were
  darkened, you would pass. There is a place, a little remote place in the
  hills, Akte by name, where the folk are said to have white skins like you,
  Signor."</p>

  <p>"Well, attend, Mitri. I am a man from Akte who has been at the wars, and
  has just returned. That will account for my foreign speech."</p>

  <p>"The Signor jests. He has a stout heart that can jest&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'm not jesting. I'm going to compete in the race to-morrow night. What
  is more, I'm going to win. I've been a bit of a runner in my time, and I'm in
  hard training."</p>

  <p>A faint spark appeared in the old man's eye.</p>

  <p>"The Signor will no doubt win if he runs. And if he ever reaches the
  Dancing Floor he will not be troubled with questions. But how will he reach
  the Dancing Floor?"</p>

  <p>"I intend to get out of the House early tomorrow morning. There are
  several things I want to do before the race. Have you any rags with which I
  can imitate the dress of a hillman?"</p>

  <p>Mitri considered. Shirt and breeches he had, but no boots. A cap might be
  improvised, but boots?</p>

  <p>"Remember I have only just returned to Akte, and have brought the fashion
  of the war with me. So I can make shift with home-made puttees. Anything
  else?"</p>

  <p>"The men around the House will not let you pass."</p>

  <p>"They'll have to. I'm one of themselves, and you've got to coach me in
  local customs. You have twelve hours before you in which to turn me into a
  respectable citizen of Akte. If any awkward questions are asked I propose to
  be truculent. A soldier is going to stand no nonsense from civilians, you
  know."</p>

  <p>Mitri considered again. "It will be best to go by the main road to
  Kynaetho."</p>

  <p>"No, I'm going by the causeway. I want to see what lies beyond it to the
  west."</p>

  <p>"The cliffs are there, and there is no road."</p>

  <p>"I will find one."</p>

  <p>Mitri shook his head. He had apparently little belief in the scheme, but
  an hour later, after Vernon had given Kor&eacute; a sketch of his intentions,
  he arrived with an armful of strange garments. &Eacute;lise, at her
  mistress's request, had collected oddments of fabrics, and brought part of
  the contents of the linen-cupboard.</p>

  <p>"We are about," Vernon told a mystified Kor&eacute;, "to prepare for
  private theatricals. Puttees are my most urgent need, and that thin skirt of
  yours will be the very thing."</p>

  <p>Since Kor&eacute; still looked puzzled, he added: "We're cast for parts in
  a rather sensational drama. I'm beginning to think that the only way to
  prevent it being a tragedy is to turn it into a costume-play."</p><br>
 <br>

  <h2><a name="chap16"
     id="chap16">CHAPTER 16</a></h2>

  <p>Very early next morning, before the blue darkness had paled into dawn,
  Vernon swung his legs out of an upper window of the House, crawled along the
  broad parapet, and began to descend by a water-pipe in an angle between the
  main building and the eastern wing. This brought him to the roof of one of
  the outbuildings, from which it was possible for an active man to reach the
  road which ran upward from the jetty. He had been carefully prepared by Mitri
  for his part. The loose white shirt and the short mountain tunic were in
  order. Mitri's breeches had proved too scanty, but &Eacute;lise had widened
  them, and the vacant space about his middle was filled with a dirty red
  cummerbund, made of one of Mitri's sashes, in which were stuck a long knife
  and his pistol. A pair of Mitri's home-made shoes of soft untanned hide were
  supplemented by home-made puttees. He had no hat; he had stained his face,
  hands and arms beyond their natural brown with juice from Mitri's store of
  pickled walnuts, and&mdash;under the critical eye of Kor&eacute;&mdash;had
  rubbed dirt under his eyes and into his finger-nails till he looked the image
  of a handsome, swaggering, half-washed soldier. More important, he had been
  coached by Mitri in the speech of the hills, the gossip which might have
  penetrated to the remote Akte, and the mannerisms of the hillmen, which were
  unpleasingly familiar to the dwellers by the sea.</p>

  <p>All this care would have been useless had Vernon not been in the mood to
  carry off any enterprise. He felt the reckless audacity of a boy, an
  exhilaration which was almost intoxication, and the source of which he did
  not pause to consider. Above all he felt complete confidence. Somehow,
  somewhere, he would break the malign spell and set Kor&eacute; beyond the
  reach of her enemies.</p>

  <p>He reached ground fifty yards south of the jetty, and turned at once in
  the direction of the sea. At the beginning of the causeway he met a man.</p>

  <p>"Whither away, brother?" came the question, accompanied by the lift of a
  rifle.</p>

  <p>Vernon gave the hillman's greeting. He loomed up tall and formidable in
  the half-darkness.</p>

  <p>"I go beyond the causeway to the olive-yards," he said carelessly, as if
  he condescended in answering. "By whose orders?"</p>

  <p>"We of Akte do not take orders. I go at the request of the Elders."</p>

  <p>"You are of Akte?" said the man curiously. He was very willing to talk,
  being bored with his long night-watch. "There are none of Akte among us, so
  far as I have seen. The men of Akte live in the moon, says the proverb. But
 ...  " this after peering at Vernon's garb&mdash;"these clothes were never
  made in the hills."</p>

  <p>"I am new back from the war, and have not seen Akte these three years. But
  I cannot linger, friend."</p>

  <p>"Nay, bide a little. It is not yet day. Let us talk of Akte. My father
  once went there for cattle...  Or let us speak of the war. My uncle was in
  the old war, and my young nephew was...  If you will not bide, give me
  tobacco."</p>

  <p>Vernon gave him a cigarette. "These are what we smoked in Smyrna," he
  said. "They are noble stuff."</p>

  <p>Half-way along the causeway a second guard proved more truculent. He
  questioned the orders of the Elders, till Vernon played the man from Akte and
  the old soldier, and threatened to fling him into the sea. The last sentry
  was fortunately asleep. Vernon scrambled over the fence of the olive-yards,
  and as the sun rose above the horizon was striding with long steps through
  the weedy undergrowth.</p>

  <p>His object was not like mine when I travelled that road&mdash;to get
  inside the demesne; he wanted to keep out of it, and to explore the bit of
  coast under it, since it seemed from the map to be the likeliest place to
  find his boat. The Epirote, he was convinced, would obey his instructions
  faithfully, and when driven away from his old anchorage would not go a yard
  more than was necessary. So, after being stopped as I had been by the wall
  which ran to the cliffs, he stuck to the shore. He picked his way under the
  skirts of the great headland till the rock sank sheer into deep water. There
  was nothing for it now but to swim, so he made a bundle of his shirt and
  jacket and bound them with the cummerbund on his shoulders, took his pistol
  in his teeth and slipped into the cold green sea. Mitri's breeches were a
  nuisance, but he was a strong swimmer, and in five minutes was at the point
  of the headland.</p>

  <p>He found a ledge of rock which enabled him to pull up his shoulders and
  reconnoitre the hidden bay. There, to his joy, was the yacht, snugly anchored
  half-way across. There was no sign of life on board, for doubtless the
  Epirote was below cooking his breakfast. Vernon had no desire to make himself
  conspicuous by shouting, for the demesne and the watchers were too near, so
  he dropped back into the water and struck out for the boat. Ten minutes later
  he was standing dripping on the deck, and the Epirote was welcoming him with
  maledictions on Plakos.</p>

  <p>He stripped off his wet clothes, and put on his old aquascutum till they
  should be dried. Then he breakfasted heartily, while Black George gave an
  account of his stewardship. When Vernon did not return he had not concerned
  himself greatly, for the affairs of his master were no business of his. But
  in the morning, when the fog began to lift, men had put off from shore in a
  boat and had demanded the reason of his presence. The interview had been
  stormy, for he had declined to explain, holding that if his master chose to
  land secretly by night, and rude fellows appeared with the daylight, it would
  be wise to tell the latter nothing. His interviewers had been more
  communicative. They had been very excited and had tried to alarm him with
  foolish tales of witches. But it was clear that they had meant mischief, for
  all were armed, and when at the point of several rifle barrels they had
  ordered him to depart, it seemed to him the part of a wise man to obey. He
  had feigned fear and deep stupidity, and had upped sail and done their
  bidding. Then, looking for a refuge, he had seen the great curtain of cliff
  and had found this little bay. Here he hoped he was secure, for there was no
  passage along the shore, and the people of Plakos did not seem during these
  days to be sailing the seas. He could be observed, of course, from the cliff
  tops, but these were shrouded in wood and looked unfrequented.</p>

  <p>"Did I not well, Signor?" he asked anxiously.</p>

  <p>"You did well. Have you seen no one?"</p>

  <p>"No islander. Last night two men came about midnight. One was a crippled
  Greek and the other man, I judge, English."</p>

  <p>Vernon woke to the liveliest interest, but Black George told a halting
  tale. "He swam out and wakened me, and at first, fearing trouble, I would
  have brained him. Since he could not speak my tongue, I rowed ashore with him
  and saw the Greek...  He was an Englishman, beyond doubt, and a Signor, so I
  gave him food."</p>

  <p>"What did he want with you?"</p>

  <p>"Simply that I should stay here. He had a story of some lady to whom the
  devils of this island meant mischief, and he begged me to wait in case the
  lady should seek to escape."</p>

  <p>No cross-examination of Vernon's could make Black George amplify the tale.
  He had not understood clearly, he said, for the English Signor could not
  speak his tongue, and the Greek who interpreted was obviously a fool. But he
  had promised to remain, which was indeed his duty to his master. No. He had
  spoken no single word of his master. He had not said he was an Englishman. He
  had said nothing.</p>

  <p>Vernon puzzled over the matter but could make nothing of it. He did not
  credit the story of an Englishman in Plakos who knew of Kor&eacute;'s plight,
  and came to the conclusion that Black George had misunderstood his visitor's
  talk. He had the day before him, and his first act was to row ashore to the
  other point of the bay&mdash;the place from which Janni and I had first
  espied the yacht. There he sat for a little and smoked, and it was one of his
  cigarette ends that I found the same afternoon. A scramble round the headland
  showed him the strip of beach below the Dancing Floor, but it occurred to him
  that there was no need to go pioneering along the coast&mdash;that he had a
  yacht and could be landed wherever he pleased. So he returned to Black
  George, and the two hoisted sail and made for open sea.</p>

  <p>The day was spent running with the light northwest wind behind them well
  to the south of Plakos, and then tacking back till about sunset they stood
  off the north-east shore. It was a day of brilliant sun, tempered by cool
  airs, with the hills of the island rising sharp and blue into the pale spring
  sky. Vernon found to his delight that he had no trepidation about the work of
  the coming night. He had brought with him the copy he had made of his
  translation of Kor&eacute;'s manuscript, and studied it as a man studies a
  map, without any sense of its strangeness. The madmen of Plakos were about to
  revive an ancient ritual, where the victor in a race would be entrusted with
  certain barbarous duties. He proposed to be the victor, and so to defeat the
  folly. The House would be burnt, and in the confusion he would escape with
  Kor&eacute; to the yacht, and leave the unhallowed isle for ever. The girl's
  honour would be satisfied, for she would have stuck it out to the last. Once
  he had convinced himself that she would be safe, he let his mind lie fallow.
  He dreamed and smoked on the hot deck in the bright weather, as much at his
  ease as if the evening were to bring no more than supper and sleep.</p>

  <p>In the early twilight the yacht's dinghy put him ashore on a lonely bit of
  coast east of the village. Black George was ordered to return to his former
  anchorage and wait there; if on the following night he saw a lantern raised
  three times on the cliff above, he was to come round to the olive-yards at
  the far end of the causeway. At this stage Vernon's plan was for a simple
  escape in the confusion of the fire. He hoped that the postern gate at the
  jetty would be practicable; if not he would find some way of reaching the
  olive-yards from the demesne. The whole affair was viewed by him as a
  straightforward enterprise&mdash;provided he could win the confounded
  race.</p>

  <p>But with his landing on Plakos in the spring gloaming his mood began to
  change. I have failed in my portrayal of Vernon if I have made you think of
  him as unimaginative and insensitive. He had unexpected blind patches in his
  vision and odd callosities in his skin, but for all that he was highly strung
  and had an immense capacity for emotion, though he chose mostly to sit on the
  safety valve. Above all he was a scholar. All his life he had been creating
  imaginative pictures of things, or living among the creations of other men.
  He had not walked a mile in that twilight till he felt the solemnity of it
  oppressing his mind.</p>

  <p>I think it was chiefly the sight of the multitude moving towards the
  Dancing Floor, all silent, so that the only sound was the tread of feet. He
  had been in doubt before as to where exactly the place was, but the road was
  blazed for him like the roads to Epsom on Derby Day. Men, women, children,
  babes-in-arms, they were streaming past the closes at the foot of the glade,
  past the graveyard, up the aisle of the Dancing Floor. It was his first sight
  of it&mdash;not as I had seen it solitary under the moon, but surging with a
  stream of hushed humanity. It had another kind of magic, but one as potent as
  that which had laid its spell on me. I had seen the temple in its loneliness;
  he saw it thronged with worshippers.</p>

  <p>No one greeted him or even noticed him; he would probably have passed
  unregarded if he had been wearing his ordinary clothes. The heavy
  preoccupation of the people made them utterly incurious. He saw men dressed
  as he was, and he noted that the multitude moved to left and right as if by
  instinct, leaving the central arena vacant. Dusk had fallen, and on the crown
  of the ridge on his right he saw dimly what he knew to be the trees of the
  demesne. He saw, too, that a cluster seemed to be forming at the lower end of
  the arena, apart from the others, and he guessed that these were the
  competitors in the race. He made his way towards them, and found that he had
  guessed rightly. It was a knot of young men, who were now stripping their
  clothes, till they stood naked except for the sashes twisted around their
  middle. Most were barefoot, but one or two had raw-hide brogues. Vernon
  followed their example, till he stood up in his short linen drawers. He
  retained Mitri's shoes, for he feared the flints of the hillside. There were
  others in the group, older men whom he took to be the Elders of whom Mitri
  had spoken, and there was one man who seemed to be in special authority and
  who wore a loose white cassock.</p>

  <p>It was now nearly dark, and suddenly, like the marks delimiting a course,
  torches broke into flame. These points of angry light in the crowded silence
  seemed to complete the spell. Vernon's assurance had fled and left behind it
  an unwilling awe and an acute nervousness. All his learning, all his
  laborious scholarship quickened from mere mental furniture into heat and
  light. His imagination as well as his nerves were on fire. I can only guess
  at the thoughts which must have crowded his mind. He saw the ritual, which so
  far had been for him an antiquarian remnant, leap into a living passion. He
  saw what he had regarded coolly as a barbaric survival, a matter for brutish
  peasants, become suddenly a vital concern of his own. Above all, he felt the
  formidableness of the peril to Kor&eacute;. She had dared far more than she
  knew, far more than he had guessed; she was facing the heavy menace of a
  thousand ages, the devils not of a few thousand peasants, but of a whole
  forgotten world...  And in that moment he has told me that another thing
  became clear to him&mdash;she had become for him something altogether rare
  and precious.</p>

  <p>The old man in the white ephod was speaking. It was a tale which had
  obviously been told before to the same audience, for he reminded them of
  former instructions. Vernon forced himself to concentrate on it an attention
  which was half paralysed by that mood of novel emotion which had come upon
  him. Some of it he failed to grasp, but the main points were clear&mdash;the
  race twice round the arena outside the ring of torches, the duty of the
  victor to take the last torch and plunge it in the sacred spring. The man
  spoke as if reciting a lesson, and Vernon heard it like a lesson once known
  and forgotten. Reminiscences of what he had found in classical byways
  hammered on his mind, and with recollection came a greater awe. It was only
  the thought of Kor&eacute; that enabled him to keep his wits. Without that,
  he told me, he would have sunk into the lethargy of the worshippers,
  obedient, absorbed in expectancy.</p>

  <p>Then came the start, and the race which Janni and I watched from our
  hiding-place in the shadows under the wall. He got off the mark clumsily, and
  at first his limbs seemed heavy as lead. But the movement revived him and
  woke his old racing instinct. Though he had not run for years, he was in hard
  training, and towards the close of the first round his skill had come back to
  him and he was in the third place, going well within his powers. In the
  second round he felt that the thing was in his hands. He lay close to the
  first man, passed him before the final straight, and then forged ahead so
  that in the last hundred yards he was gaining ground with every stride. He
  seized the torch at the winning-post and raced to where in the centre of the
  upper glade a white figure stood alone. With the tossing of the flame into
  the well he straightened his body and looked round, a man restored to his old
  vigour and ready for swift action.</p>

  <p>His account of the next stage was confused, for his mind was on
  Kor&eacute;, and he was going through a violent transformation of outlook.
  The old man was no longer repeating a rehearsed lesson, but speaking
  violently like one in a moment of crisis. He addressed Vernon as "You of the
  hills," and told him that God had placed the fate of Kynaetho in his
  hands&mdash;which God he did not particularize. But from his excited
  stammering something emerged that chilled Vernon's blood...  He was to wait
  in the House till moonrise of the next night. The signal was to be the firing
  of the place. With the first flames he was to perform the deed to which he
  had been called. "Choose which way you please," said the old man, "provided
  that they die." Then he would leave the House by the main door and join the
  young men without. "They will be gathered there till they come who will
  come." The door would be closed behind him till it was opened by the fire...
  "They who will come are Immortals."</p>

  <p>The man's voice was high-pitched with passion, and his figure, solitary in
  the bright moonshine in that ring of silent folk, had something in it of the
  awful and the sacramental. But Vernon's thoughts were not on it, but on the
  news which meant the downfall of his plans. His mind worked now normally and
  sanely; he was again a man of the modern world. The young men&mdash;of course
  they would be there&mdash;the Kouretes to greet the Kouros. He might have
  known it, if he had only thought. But how was Kor&eacute; to escape from
  those frenzied guardians? He had imagined that with the fire the vigilance of
  the watch would be relaxed and that it would be easy to join Black George and
  the boat. But with the fire there was to be a thronging of the hierophants
  towards the House, and what was inside would be kept inside till the place
  was a heap of ashes.</p>

  <p>The man was speaking again. He had made some signal, for three figures had
  approached the well. "The woman is within," he said, "and it is for you to
  choose the man. Your choice is free among the people of Plakos, but we have
  one here, a young man, a Greek, but a stranger. He would doubtless be
  acceptable."</p>

  <p>The half-clad Maris cut an odd figure as, in the grip of two stalwart
  peasants, he was led forward for inspection. His face was white and set, and
  his eyes were furious. "No willing victim this," thought Vernon, "but so much
  the better, for he and I are in the same boat, and I must make him an ally."
  From the way he carried himself he saw that Maris had been drilled, and he
  considered that a soldier might be useful. "I choose this man," he said.</p>

  <p>A jar was given him, and he filled it from the spring and emptied it on
  Maris's head and shoulders. His own clothes were also brought, but he
  contented himself with Mitri's sash, of which he made a girdle and into which
  he stuck his own pistol and Mitri's knife. "I have no need of the rest," he
  said, for he was beginning to enter into the spirit of the part. Then he
  knelt while the old man laid a hand on his head and pronounced some
  consecration. "Come," he said to Maris, and the two moved up the slope of the
  Dancing Floor towards the breach in the wall.</p>

  <p>He had almost forgotten his anxiety in the wonder of the scene. He seemed
  to be set on a stage in a great golden amphitheatre, and Maris and the guards
  who accompanied him were no more than stage properties. All human life had
  for the moment gone, and he was faced with primordial elements&mdash;the
  scented shell of earth, the immense arch of the sky and the riding moon, and,
  as he climbed the slope, an infinity of shining waters. The magic weighed on
  him, a new magic, for the ruthlessness of man was submerged in the deeper
  ruthlessness of nature...  And then, as he passed the fringe of the
  spectators and caught a glimpse of pallid strained faces, he got his bearings
  again. It was man he had to cope with, crazy, fallible, tormented man. He
  felt the pity and innocence of it behind the guilt, and in an instant he
  regained confidence...  Maris was stumbling along, walking painfully like one
  unaccustomed to going on bare feet, casting fierce, startled glances about
  him. As they approached the breach in the wall Vernon managed to whisper to
  him to cheer up, for no ill would befall him. "I am your friend," he said;
  "together we will make an end of this folly," and the man's face
  lightened.</p>

  <p>It was this look on Maris's face which I saw from my hiding-place and
  which made me forbid Janni's pistol shot.</p><br>
 <br>

  <h2><a name="chap17"
     id="chap17">CHAPTER 17</a></h2>

  <p>The great doors clanged behind them, and Vernon, who had been given the
  key by the guards, turned it in the lock. In spite of the reassuring word he
  had spoken to Maris he thought that his companion might attack him, so he
  steered wide of him and in the inky darkness fell over a basket of logs. The
  mishap wrung from him a very English expletive. Then he shouted on Mitri to
  bring a light.</p>

  <p>He heard Maris's excited voice. "Who are you? Who in God's name are you?
  Are you English?"</p>

  <p>"Of course I am English. Confound it, I believe I have cracked my shin.
  Mitri, you idiot, where are you?"</p>

  <p>The old man appeared from a corridor with a lantern shaking in his hand.
  He had no words, but stared at the two as if he were looking on men risen
  from the dead.</p>

  <p>"Where's your mistress? In her sitting-room? For God's sake, get me some
  clothes&mdash;my old ones, and bring something for this gentleman to put on.
  Any old thing will do. Get us some food, too, for we're starving. Quick, man.
  Leave the lantern here."</p>

  <p>By the slender light, set on a table in the great stone hall, the two men
  regarded each other.</p>

  <p>"You want to know who I am," said Vernon. "I'm an Englishman who came here
  three nights ago in a yacht. I happened to have met Miss Arabin before. I
  found out what the people of Plakos were up to, and it seemed to me that the
  best thing I could do was to win the race to-night. I needn't tell you about
  that, for you saw it...  Now for yourself. I gather that you also are
  unpopular in this island?"</p>

  <p>Maris gave a short sketch of his career, and Vernon convinced himself by a
  few questions that he spoke the truth, for the Greek had served alongside the
  British at Salonika.</p>

  <p>"I came here to protect the lady," Maris concluded.</p>

  <p>"Who sent you?"</p>

  <p>"Mr. Ertzberger. I had a companion, an English colonel, who is also in
  your Parliament, and a great milord. Leithen is his name."</p>

  <p>"God bless my soul! Leithen! Oh, impossible! Quick! Tell me more. Where is
  he now?"</p>

  <p>"That I do not know. Yesterday evening we separated, each seeking to find
  some way of entering this House. I blundered badly, and was taken by the
  guards on the seaward front. My friend must also have failed, or he would be
  here, but I do not think he has been taken."</p>

  <p>The knowledge that I was somewhere in the island gave Vernon, as he told
  me, a sudden acute sense of comfort. I must have been the visitor to the
  yacht. He cross-examined Maris, who knew nothing of the boat's existence, and
  Maris agreed that the stranger who had gone aboard must have been myself.
  "The Greek who was with him," he said, "was doubtless my corporal, Janni, the
  one man in my batch of fools who kept his head."</p>

  <p>Mitri returned with Vernon's clothes, and an ancient dressing-gown for
  Maris. He also brought a bowl of milk and some cakes and cheese. Questions
  trembled on his lips, but Vernon waved him off. "Go and tell your mistress
  that we will come to her in a quarter of an hour. And have a bed made ready
  for this gentleman."</p>

  <p>As Vernon dressed he had a look at his companion, now grotesquely robed in
  a gown too large for him, and dirty and scratched from his adventures. It was
  the mercy of Providence that had given him such a colleague, for he liked the
  man's bold, hard-bitten face and honest eyes. Here was a practical fellow,
  and he wanted something exceedingly prosaic and practical to counteract the
  awe which still hovered about his mind. He fought to keep at a distance the
  memory of the silence and the torches and the shining spaces of the Dancing
  Floor. This man did not look susceptible.</p>

  <p>"I need not tell you that we are in the devil of a tight place, Captain
  Maris. Do you realize precisely the meaning of the performance we have just
  witnessed?"</p>

  <p>Maris nodded. "Since yesterday. It has been most pointedly explained to
  me. I am one victim for the sacrifice, and the lady of this house is the
  other, and you are the priest."</p>

  <p>"We have the better part of twenty-four hours' grace. After that?"</p>

  <p>"After that this House will be burned. You may go forth, if you have the
  nerve to play the part. The lady and I&mdash;no. We are supposed to die when
  the fire begins, but if we do not die by your hand we will die in the
  flames."</p>

  <p>"There is no way of escape?"</p>

  <p>"None," said Maris cheerfully. "But with your help I think we will do some
  mischief first. God's curse on the swine!"</p>

  <p>"And the lady?"</p>

  <p>Maris shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Till this evening," said Vernon, "I thought I had a plan. I was pretty
  certain I could win the race, and I proposed to reason with the male victim
  who came back with me, or club him on the head. I thought that when the fire
  began there would be confusion and that the people would keep outside the
  wall. My boat is lying below the cliffs, and I hoped to carry the lady there.
  But now I know that that is impossible. There will be a concourse of the
  young men outside the door at the moment of the burning, and the House will
  be watched more closely than ever. Do you know what the people expect?"</p>

  <p>Maris spat contemptuously. "I heard some talk of the coming of Gods. The
  devil take all priests and their lying tales."</p>

  <p>"They await the coming of Gods. You are not a classical scholar, Captain
  Maris, so you cannot realize, perhaps, just what that means. We are dealing
  with stark madness. These peasants are keyed up to a tremendous expectation.
  A belief has come to life, a belief far older than Christianity. They expect
  salvation from the coming of two Gods, a youth and a maiden. If their hope is
  disappointed, they will be worse madmen than before. To-morrow night nothing
  will go out from this place, unless it be Gods."</p>

  <p>"That is true. The lady and I will without doubt die at the threshold, and
  you also, my friend. What arms have we?"</p>

  <p>"I have this revolver with six cartridges. The lady has a toy pistol, but,
  I think, no ammunition. The men without are armed with rifles."</p>

  <p>"Ugly odds. It is infamous that honest folk and soldiers should perish at
  the hands of the half-witted."</p>

  <p>"What about Leithen? He is outside and has come here expressly to save the
  lady."</p>

  <p>Maris shook his head. "He can do nothing. They have set up a cordon, a
  barrage, which he cannot penetrate. There is no hope in the island, for every
  man and woman is under the Devil's spell. Also the telegraph has been cut
  these three days."</p>

  <p>"Do you see any chance?"</p>

  <p>Maris cogitated. "We have twenty-four hours. Some way of escape may be
  found by an active man at the risk of a bullet or two. We might reach your
  boat."</p>

  <p>"But the lady?"</p>

  <p>"Why, no. Things look dark for the poor lady. We came here to protect her,
  and it seems as if we can do no more than die with her...  I would like to
  speak with that old man about clothes. A soldier does not feel at his bravest
  when he is barefoot and unclad save for pants and a ragged shirt. I refuse to
  go to Paradise in this dressing-gown."</p>

  <p>Maris's cheerful fortitude was balm to Vernon's mind, for it seemed to
  strip the aura of mystery from the situation, and leave it a straight gamble
  of life and death. If Kor&eacute; was to be saved it must be through Maris,
  for he himself was cast for another part.</p>

  <p>"Come and let me present you to the lady," he said. "We must have some
  plan to sleep on."</p>

  <p>Kor&eacute; was in her sitting-room, and as she rose to meet them he saw
  that her face was very white.</p>

  <p>"I heard nothing," she said hoarsely, "though Mitri says that there are
  thousands in the glade beyond the wall. But I saw a red glow from the upper
  windows."</p>

  <p>"That was the torches which lined the stadium. I have been running a race,
  Miss Arabin, and have been lucky enough to win. Therefore we have still
  twenty-four hours of peace. May I present Captain Maris of the Greek Army? He
  asks me to apologize for his clothes."</p>

  <p>The Greek bowed gallantly and kissed her hand.</p>

  <p>"Captain Maris came here to protect you. He came with a friend of ours,
  Sir Edward Leithen."</p>

  <p>"Sir Edward Leithen?" the girl cried. "He is here?"</p>

  <p>"He is in the island, but he is unable to join us in the House. Captain
  Maris tried, and was unfortunately captured. He was handed over to me as the
  victor of the race, and that is why he is here. But Sir Edward must be still
  scouting around the outposts, and it is pretty certain that he won't find a
  way in. I'm afraid we must leave him out of account...  Now I want you to
  listen to me very carefully, for I've a good deal to say to you. I'm going to
  be perfectly candid, for you're brave enough to hear the worst."</p>

  <p>Vernon constructed three cigarettes out of his pipe tobacco and tissue
  paper from the illustrations in Peter Beckford. Kor&eacute; did not light
  hers, but sat waiting with her hands on her knees.</p>

  <p>"They think you a witch, because of the habits of your family. That you
  have long known. In the past they have burned witches in these islands, and
  Plakos remembers it. But it remembers another thing&mdash;the ancient ritual
  I told you of, and that memory which has been sleeping for centuries has come
  to violent life. Perhaps it would not have mastered them if the mind of the
  people had not been full of witch-burning. That, you see, gave them one
  victim already chosen, and in Captain Maris, who is of their own race and
  also a stranger, they have found the other."</p>

  <p>"I see all that," the girl said slowly. "Of course I did not know when I
  left London&mdash;I couldn't have guessed&mdash;I thought it was a simple
  business which only needed a bold front, and I was too vain to take advice
 ...  Oh, forgive me. My vanity has brought two innocent people into my
  miserable troubles... "</p>

  <p>"I told you yesterday that we were going to win. You must trust me, Miss
  Arabin. And for Heaven's sake, don't imagine that I blame you. I think you
  are the bravest thing God ever made. I wouldn't be elsewhere for worlds."</p>

  <p>Her eyes searched his face closely, and then turned to Maris, who
  instantly adopted an air of bold insouciance.</p>

  <p>"You are good men...  But what can you do? They will watch us like rats
  till the fire begins, and then&mdash;if we are not dead&mdash;they will kill
  us...  They will let no one go from this House&mdash;except their Gods."</p>

  <p>These were the very words Vernon had used to Maris, and since they so
  wholly expressed his own belief, he had to repudiate them with a vehement
  confidence.</p>

  <p>"No," he said, "you forget that there are two things on our side. One is
  that, as the winner of the race, I am one of the people of Plakos. I can
  safely go out at the last moment and join their young men. I speak their
  tongue, and I understand this ritual better than they do themselves. Surely I
  can find some way of driving them farther from the House so that in the
  confusion Maris can get you and your maid off unobserved. Mitri
  too&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Mitri," she broke in, "has permission from our enemies to go when he
  pleases. But he refuses to leave us."</p>

  <p>"Well, Mitri also. The second thing is that I have found my boat and got
  in touch with my man. He is lying in the bay below the cliffs, and I have
  arranged that on a certain signal he will meet you under the olive-yards.
  There is a gate in the wall there of which Mitri no doubt has the key. Once
  aboard, you are as safe as in London."</p>

  <p>"And you?"</p>

  <p>"Oh. I will take my chance. I am a hillman from Akte and can keep up the
  part till I find some way of getting off."</p>

  <p>"Impossible!" she cried. "When they find that their Gods have failed them
  they will certainly kill you. Perhaps it is because I was born here, but
  though I have only heard of this ritual from you, I feel somehow as if I had
  always known it. And I know that if the one sacrifice fails, there will be
  another."</p>

  <p>She rang the little silver bell for Mitri. "Show this gentleman his room,"
  she looked towards Maris. "You have already had food? Goodnight, Captain
  Maris. You must have had a wearing day, and I order you to bed."</p>

  <p>When they were alone she turned to Vernon. "Your plan will not work. I can
  make a picture of what will happen to-morrow night&mdash;I seem to see every
  detail clear, as if I had been through it all before&mdash;and your plan is
  hopeless. You cannot draw them away from the House. They will be watching
  like demented wolves...  And if you did and we escaped, what on earth would
  become of you?"</p>

  <p>"I should be one of them&mdash;a sharer in their
  disappointment&mdash;probably forgotten."</p>

  <p>"Not you. You are their high-priest, and an angry people always turns on
  their priest."</p>

  <p>"There might be a bit of a row, but I daresay I could hold my own."</p>

  <p>"Against thousands&mdash;mad thousands? You would be torn in pieces even
  though they still believed you were a hillman from Akte."</p>

  <p>"I'll take the risk. It is no good making difficulties, Miss Arabin. I
  admit that the case is pretty desperate, but my plan has at any rate a
  chance."</p>

  <p>"The case is utterly desperate, and that is why your plan is no good.
  Desperate cases need more desperate remedies."</p>

  <p>"Well, what do you suggest?"</p>

  <p>She smiled. "You are very tired, and so am I. We have a day and a night
  left us, and we can talk in the morning...  I told you when you first came
  here that I refused to run away. Well, I&mdash;don't&mdash;think&mdash;I have
  changed my mind... "</p>

  <p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

  <p>The difficulty of telling this part of the story (said Leithen) is that it
  must be largely guess-work. The main facts I know, but the affair had become
  so strange and intimate that neither Kor&eacute; nor Vernon would speak of
  it, while Maris was only vaguely aware of what was happening. It must have
  been some time on the Friday morning that the two met again. I can picture
  Vernon racking his brains to supplement his fragile plan, turning sleeplessly
  in his bed, hunting out Maris in the early morn to go wearily over the
  slender chances. Kor&eacute;, I imagine, slept dreamlessly. She had reached
  her decision, and to her strong and simple soul to be resolved was to be at
  peace. Vernon was a fine fellow&mdash;I have known few finer&mdash;but there
  were lumpish elements in him, while the girl was all pure spirit.</p>

  <p>But I can reconstruct the meeting of the two in the bare little
  sitting-room&mdash;without Maris&mdash;for that much Vernon has told me. I
  can see Vernon's anxious face, and the girl's eyes bright with that innocent
  arrogance which once in my haste I had thought ill-breeding.</p>

  <p>"I am not going to run away from my people," she said. "I am going to meet
  them."</p>

  <p>Vernon asked her meaning, and she replied:</p>

  <p>"I said yesterday that no one would be permitted to leave the House,
  unless in the eyes of the watchers they were Gods. Well, the Gods will not
  fail them...  Listen to me. I have tried to purify this place, but there can
  be only one purification, and that is by fire. It had to come, and it seems
  to me right that it should come from the hands of those who have suffered.
  After that I go out as a free woman&mdash;and to a free woman nothing is
  impossible."</p>

  <p>I think that for a little he may not have understood her. His mind, you
  see, had been busy among small particulars, and the simplicity of her plan
  would not at once be comprehended. Then there came for him that moment of
  liberation, when the world clarifies and what have been barrier mountains
  become only details in a wide prospect. The extreme of boldness is seen to be
  the true discretion, and with that mood comes a sharp uplift of spirit.</p>

  <p>"You are right," he cried. "We will give them their Gods."</p>

  <p>"Gods?" She stopped him. "But I must go alone. You have no part in this
  trial. But if I win all this household will be safe. Most of these people
  have never seen me, and Kynaetho knows me only as a girl in old country
  clothes from whom they kept their eyes averted. I can dress for a different
  part, and they will see some one who will be as new to them as if the Panagia
  had come down from Heaven. But you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"They will not be content with one divinity," he broke in. "They await a
  double epiphany, remember&mdash;the Kor&eacute; and the Kouros. That is the
  point of the occasion. We must be faithful to the letter of the rite. After
  all, they know less of me than of you. They saw me win a race, a figure very
  much like the others in the moonlight...  To those who may recognize me I am
  an unknown hillman of Akte. Why should not the Kouros have revealed himself
  the day before, and be also the Basileus?"</p>

  <p>She looked at him curiously as if seeing him for the first time as a
  bodily presence. I can fancy that for the first time she may have recognized
  his beauty and strength.</p>

  <p>"But you are not like me," she urged. "You have not an old burden to get
  rid of. I am shaking off the incubus of my youth, and going free, like the
  Gods. What you call the epiphany is not only for Plakos but for myself, and
  nothing matters, not even death. I can play the part, but can you? To me it
  is going to be the beginning of life, but to you it can only be an adventure.
  Chivalry is not enough."</p>

  <p>"To me also it is the beginning of life," he answered. Then he returned to
  the tale of his boyhood's dream. "When it vanished in the storm a few nights
  ago I hated it, for I felt that it had stolen years from my life. But now I
  know that nothing is wasted. The door of the last of the dream-rooms has
  opened, and you have come in. And we are going to begin
  life&mdash;together."</p>

  <p>A strange pair of lovers, between whom no word of love had yet been
  spoken! By very different roads both had reached a complete assurance, and
  with it came exhilaration and ease of mind. Maris during the long spring day
  might roam about restlessly, and Mitri and &Eacute;lise fall to their several
  prayers, but Vernon and Kor&eacute; had no doubts. While I, outside the wall,
  was at the mercy of old magics, a mere piece of driftwood tossed upon
  undreamed-of tides, the two in the House had almost forgotten Plakos. It had
  become to them no more than a background for their own overmastering private
  concerns. The only problem was for their own hearts; for Kor&eacute; to shake
  off for good the burden of her past and vindicate her fiery purity, that
  virginity of the spirit which could not be smirched by man or matter; for
  Vernon to open the door at which he had waited all his life and redeem the
  long preparation of his youth. They had followed each their own paths of
  destiny, and now these paths had met and must run together. That was the kind
  of thing that could not be questioned, could not even be thought about; it
  had to be accepted, like the rising sun. I do not think that they appreciated
  their danger, as I did, for they had not been, like me, down in the shadows.
  They were happy in their half-knowledge, and in that blessed preoccupation
  which casts out fear.</p>

  <p>But some time in the afternoon he drew for the girl a picture of the
  ancient rite, and he must have been inspired, for, as she once recounted it
  to me, he seems to have made his book learning like the tale of an
  eye-witness.</p>

  <p>"Why do you tell me this?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Because if we are to play our part we must understand that there is
  beauty as well as terror in this worship."</p>

  <p>"You speak as if you were a believer."</p>

  <p>He laughed. "There is truth in every religion that the heart of man ever
  conceived. It is because of that that we shall win."</p>

  <p>But I think his confidence was less complete than hers. I judge from what
  Maris told me that, though Vernon was what the Scotch call "fey" during those
  last hours, he retained something of his old careful prevision. As the
  twilight fell he took Maris aside and gave him his pistol. "Mitri has orders
  as soon as he gets out of the House to take a lantern to the cliffs and make
  the signal for my boat. He has a key, and will open the door in the
  olive-yard wall. Miss Arabin and I are staking everything on a mighty gamble.
  If it succeeds, I think that the people will be in a stupor and we shall have
  an opportunity to join you. But if it fails&mdash;well, they will tear us to
  pieces. You must be close to us and await events. If the worst happens, one
  of these bullets is for the lady. Swear to me on your honour as a
  soldier."</p><br>
 <br>

  <h2><a name="chap18"
     id="chap18">CHAPTER 18</a></h2>

  <p>I take up the tale now (said Leithen) at the point where I fell in with
  Maris in the avenue which led to the gap in the wall. As I have told you, I
  had stumbled through the undergrowth with the blazing House making the place
  an inferno of blood-red aisles and purple thickets. Above the roar of the
  flames I heard the noise of panic-driven feet, of men plunging in
  haste&mdash; two indeed I had met, who seemed to be in the extremity of fear.
  For myself I was pretty nearly at the end of my tether. I was doddering with
  fatigue, and desperate with anxiety, and the only notion in my head was to
  use the dregs of my strength to do something violent. I was utterly in the
  dark, too. I did not know but that Kor&eacute; might be already beyond my
  help, for that crimson grove seemed to reek of death.</p>

  <p>And then I blundered into Maris, saw something in his face which gave me a
  surge of hope, and with his hand on my arm turned my eyes up the avenue.</p>

  <p>The back part of the House and the outbuildings were by this time one
  roaring gust of flame, but the front was still untouched, and the fan of fire
  behind it gave it the concave darkness of a shell&mdash;a purple dark which
  might at any moment burst into light. The glow beyond the fa&ccedil;ade was
  reflected farther down the avenue, which was as bright as day, but the House
  end was shadowed, and the two figures which I saw seemed to be emerging from
  a belt of blackness between two zones of raw gold. I therefore saw them first
  as two dim white forms, which, as they moved, caught tints of flame... </p>

  <p>Put it down to fatigue, if you like, or to natural stupidity, but I did
  not recognize them. Besides, you see, I knew nothing of Vernon's presence
  there. My breath stopped, and I felt my heart leap to my throat. What I saw
  seemed not of the earth&mdash; immortals, whether from Heaven or Hell, coming
  out of the shadows and the fire in white garments, beings that no elements
  could destroy. In that moment the most panicky of the guards now fleeing from
  the demesne was no more abject believer than I.</p>

  <p>And then another fugitive barged into me, and Maris caught him by the arm
  and cuffed his ears. I saw that it was Janni, but the sight meant nothing to
  me. The corporal seemed to be whimpering with terror, and Maris talked
  fiercely to him, but I did not listen. He quieted him, and then he took us
  both by an arm and hurried us with him towards the gap. It was what I wanted
  to do. I dared not look again on that burning pageant.</p>

  <p>The next I knew I was beyond the wall on the edge of the Dancing Floor. I
  do not know how I got there, for my legs seemed to have no power in them, and
  I fancy that Maris dragged us both. The scared guards must have preceded us,
  for behind was emptiness, save for the presences in the avenue. The thick
  trees partly blanketed the fire, but the light from the burning roof fell
  beyond them and lit up redly the scarp on which we stood. A rival light, too,
  was coming into being. The rising moon had already flooded the far hills, and
  its calm radiance was sweeping over the hollow packed with the waiting
  multitude.</p>

  <p>At first I saw only the near fringes of the people&mdash; upturned faces
  in the uncanny light of the fire. But as I looked, the unfeatured darkness
  beyond changed also into faces&mdash; faces spectral in the soft moonshine. I
  seemed to be standing between two worlds, one crimson with terror and the
  other golden with a stranger spell, but both far removed from the kindly
  works of men.</p>

  <p>Maris had pulled us aside out of the line of the breach in the wall, where
  the avenue made a path for the glow of the fire. We were in full view of the
  people, but they had no eyes for us, for their gaze was concentrated on the
  breach. The fugitive guards had by this time been absorbed, and their panic
  had not communicated itself to the great multitude. For a second I forgot my
  own fears in the amazing sight before me...  The crowded Dancing Floor was
  silent; in face of that deep stillness the crackle and roar of the fire
  seemed no more than the beating of waves on a far-away coast. Though the moon
  made the hills yellow as corn, it left the upturned faces pale. I was looking
  down on a sea of white faces&mdash;featureless to me, masks of strained
  expectation. I felt the influence from them beat upon me like a wind. The
  fierce concentration of mingled hope and fear&mdash; wild hope, wilder
  fear&mdash;surged up to me, and clutched at my nerves and fired my brain. For
  a second I was as exalted as the craziest of them. Fragments of the dithyramb
  which Vernon had translated came unbidden to my lips&mdash;"Io, Kouros most
  great...  Come, O come, and bring with thee&mdash;holy hours of thy most holy
  Spring."</p>

  <p>The spell of the waiting people made me turn, as they had turned, to the
  gap in the wall. Through it, to the point where the glow of the conflagration
  mingled with the yellow moonlight, came the two figures.</p>

  <p>I think I would have dropped on my knees, but that Maris fetched me a
  clout on the back, and his exultant voice cried in my ear. "Bravo," he cried.
  "By the Mother of God, they win! That is a great little lady!"</p>

  <p>There was something in the familiarity, the friendly roughness of the
  voice which broke the spell. I suddenly looked with seeing eyes, and I saw
  Kor&eacute;.</p>

  <p>She was dressed in white, the very gown which had roused Vernon's ire at
  my cousin's dance the summer before. A preposterous garment I had thought it,
  the vagary of an indecent fashion. But now&mdash;ah now! It seemed the
  fitting robe for youth and innocence&mdash;divine youth, heavenly
  innocence&mdash;clothing but scarcely veiling the young Grace who walked like
  Persephone among the spring meadows. <i>Vera incessu patuit Dea</i>. It was
  not Kor&eacute; I was looking at, but <i>the</i> Kor&eacute;, the immortal
  maiden, who brings to the earth its annual redemption.</p>

  <p>I was a sane man once more, and filled with another kind of exaltation. I
  have never felt so sharp a sense of joy. God had not failed us. I knew that
  Kor&eacute; was now not only safe but triumphant.</p>

  <p>And then I recognized Vernon.</p>

  <p>I did not trouble to think by what mad chance he had come there. It seemed
  wholly right that he should be there. He was dressed like the runner of the
  day before, but at the moment I did not connect the two. What I was looking
  at was an incarnation of something that mankind has always
  worshipped&mdash;youth rejoicing to run its race, that youth which is the
  security of this world's continuance and the earnest of Paradise.</p>

  <p>I recognized my friends, and yet I did not recognize them, for they were
  transfigured. In a flash of insight I understood that it was not the
  Kor&eacute; and the Vernon that I had known, but new creations. They were not
  acting a part, but living it. They, too, were believers; they had found their
  own epiphany, for they had found themselves and each other. Each other! How I
  knew it I do not know, but I realized that it was two lovers that stood on
  the brink of the Dancing Floor. And I felt a great glow of peace and
  happiness.</p>

  <p>With that I could face the multitude once more. And then I saw the supreme
  miracle.</p>

  <p>People talk about the psychology of a crowd, how it is different in kind
  from the moods of the men who compose it. I daresay that is true, but if you
  have each individual strained to the extreme of tension with a single hope,
  the mood of the whole is the same as that of the parts, only multiplied a
  thousandfold. And if the nerve of a crowd goes there is a vast cracking, just
  as the rending of a tree-trunk is greater than the breaking of a twig.</p>

  <p>For a second&mdash;not more&mdash;the two figures stood on the edge of the
  Dancing Floor in the sight of the upturned eyes. I do not think that
  Kor&eacute; and Vernon saw anything&mdash; they had their own inward vision.
  I do not know what the people saw in the presences that moved out of the
  darkness above them.</p>

  <p>But this I saw. Over the multitude passed a tremor like a wind in a field
  of wheat. Instead of a shout of triumph there was a low murmur as of a
  thousand sighs. And then there came a surge, men and women stumbling in
  terror. First the fringes opened and thinned, and in another second, as it
  seemed to me, the whole mass was in precipitate movement. And then it became
  panic&mdash;naked, veritable panic. The silence was broken by hoarse cries of
  fear. I saw men running like hares on the slopes of the Dancing Floor. I saw
  women dragging their children as if fleeing from a pestilence...  In a
  twinkling I was looking down on an empty glade with the Spring of the White
  Cypress black and solitary in the moonlight.</p>

  <p>I did not doubt what had happened. The people of Plakos had gone after
  strange gods, but it was only for a short season that they could shake
  themselves free from the bonds of a creed which they had held for a thousand
  years. The resurgence of ancient faiths had obscured but had not destroyed
  the religion into which they had been born. Their spells had been too
  successful. They had raised the Devil and now fled from him in the blindest
  terror. They had sought the outlands, had felt their biting winds, and had a
  glimpse of their awful denizens, and they longed with the passion of children
  for their old homely shelters. The priest of Kynaetho would presently have
  his fill of stricken penitents.</p>

  <p>Maris was laughing. I daresay it was only a relief from nervous strain,
  but it seemed to me an impiety. I turned on him angrily. "There's a boat
  somewhere. See that everybody is aboard&mdash;the whole household. And bring
  it round to the harbour where we first landed."</p>

  <p>"Not to the olive-yards?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"No, you fool. To the harbour. Plakos is now as safe for us as the streets
  of Athens."</p>

  <p>Kor&eacute; and Vernon stood hand in hand like people in a dream. I think
  they were already dimly aware of what had happened, and were slowly coming
  back to the ordinary world. The virtue was going out of them, and with the
  ebbing of their exaltation came an immense fatigue. I never saw human faces
  so pale.</p>

  <p>Vernon was the first to recover. He put his arm round Kor&eacute;'s waist,
  for without it she would have fallen, but he himself was none too steady on
  his feet. He recognized me.</p>

  <p>"Ned," he said, in a stammering voice, like a sleep-walker's. "I heard you
  were here. It was good of you, old man...  What do you think...  now...  the
  boat... "</p>

  <p>"Come along," I cried, and I took an arm of each. "The sooner you are on
  board the better. You want to sleep for a week." I started them off along the
  edge of the Dancing Floor.</p>

  <p>"Not that way," he gasped. "Too risky... "</p>

  <p>"There is no danger anywhere in this blessed island. Come along. You want
  food and clothes. It's getting on for midnight, and you're both only
  half-dressed."</p>

  <p>They were like two children pulled out of bed and too drowsy to walk, and
  I had my work cut out getting them along the ridge. The Dancing Floor was
  empty, and when we entered the road which led from Kynaetho to the main gate
  of the House there was also solitude. Indeed, we had to pass through a
  segment of the village itself, and the place was silent as the grave. I knew
  where the people were&mdash;in and around the church, grovelling in the dust
  for their sins.</p>

  <p>Our going was so slow that by the time we looked down on the harbour the
  boat was already there. I stopped for a moment and glanced back, for far
  behind me I heard voices. There was a glow as from torches to the south where
  the church stood, and a murmur which presently swelled into an excited
  clamour. Suddenly a bell began to ring, and it seemed as if the noise became
  antiphonal, voices speaking and others replying. At that distance I could
  make out nothing, but I knew what the voices said. It was "Christ is
  risen&mdash;He is risen indeed."</p>

  <p>The moon had set before we put to sea. My last recollection of Plakos is
  looking back and seeing the House flaming like a pharos on its headland.
  Then, as we beat outward with the wind, the fire became a mere point of
  brightness seen at a great distance in the vault of night.</p>

  <p>I had no wish or power to sleep. Kor&eacute; and Vernon, wrapped each in a
  heap of cloaks, lay in the bows. It was the quietest place, but there was no
  need of precautions, for they slept like the drugged. &Eacute;lise, whose
  nerves had broken down, was in Vernon's berth, Black George had the helm, and
  old Mitri and Janni snored beside him.</p>

  <p>I sat amidships and smoked. When the moon went down a host of stars came
  out, pale and very remote as they always seem in a spring sky. The wind was
  light and the water slid smoothly past; I knew roughly our bearings, but I
  had a sense of being in another world, and on seas never before sailed by
  man. The last week had been for me a time of acute anxiety and violent bodily
  exertion, but a sponge seemed to have passed over the memory of it. Something
  altogether different filled my mind. I had with my own eyes seen Fate take a
  hand in the game and move the pieces on the board. The two sleepers in the
  bows had trusted their destiny and had not been betrayed.</p>

  <p>I thought with contrition of my cynicism about Vernon's dream. No doubt it
  had been a will-o'-the-wisp, but it had been true in purpose, for it had made
  him wait, alert and aware, on something which had been prepared for him, and
  if that something was far different from his forecast the long expectation
  had made him ready to seize it. How otherwise could he, with his decorous
  ancestry and his prudent soul, have become an adventurer?...  And
  Kor&eacute;? She had stood grimly to the duty which she conceived Fate to
  have laid upon her, and Fate, after piling the odds against her, had
  relented. Perhaps that is the meaning of courage. It wrestles with
  circumstance, like Jacob with the angel, till it compels its antagonist to
  bless it.</p>

  <p>I remembered a phrase which Vernon had once used about "the mailed
  virgin." It fitted this girl, and I began to realize the meaning of
  virginity. True purity, I thought, whether in woman or man, was something far
  more than the narrow sex thing which was the common notion of it. It meant
  keeping oneself, as the Bible says, altogether unspotted from the world, free
  from all tyranny and stain, whether of flesh or spirit, defying the universe
  to touch even the outworks of the sanctuary which is one's soul. It must be
  defiant, not the inert fragile crystal, but the supple shining sword.
  Virginity meant nothing unless it was mailed, and I wondered whether we were
  not coming to a better understanding of it. The modern girl, with all her
  harshness, had the gallantry of a free woman. She was a crude Artemis, but
  her feet were on the hills. Was the blushing, sheltered maid of our
  grandmother's day no more than an untempted Aphrodite?</p>

  <p>These were queer reflections, I know, for a man like me, but they gave me
  contentment, as if I had somehow made my peace with life. For a long time I
  listened to the ripple of the water and watched the sky lighten to dim grey,
  and the east flush with sunrise. It had become very cold and I was getting
  sleepy, so I hunted about for a mattress to make myself a bed. But a thought
  made me pause. How would these two, who had come together out of the night,
  shake down on the conventional roads of marriage? To the end of time the
  desire of a woman should be to her husband. Would Kor&eacute;'s eyes,
  accustomed to look so masterfully at life, ever turn to Vernon in the
  surrender of wifely affection? As I looked at the two in the bows I
  wondered.</p>

  <p>Then something happened which reassured me. The girl stirred uneasily as
  if in a bad dream, turned to where Vernon lay, and flung out her hand. Both
  were sound asleep, but in some secret way the impulse must have been
  communicated to Vernon, for he moved on his side, and brought an arm, which
  had been lying loosely on the rug which covered him, athwart Kor&eacute;'s in
  a gesture of protection.</p>

  <p>After that both seemed to be at peace, while the yawl ran towards the
  mainland hills, now green as a fern in the spring dawn.</p>
