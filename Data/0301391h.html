  <h2><a id="intro"
     name="intro"></a>INTRODUCTION: THE DREAM BOOK OF DR. PHILIP RAVEN</h2>

  <p class="first">The unexpected death of Dr. Philip Raven at Geneva in
  November 1930 was a very grave loss to the League of Nations Secretariat.
  Geneva lost a familiar figure &mdash;the long bent back, the halting gait,
  the head quizzically on one side&mdash;and the world lost a stimulatingly
  aggressive mind. His incessant devoted work, his extraordinary mental vigour,
  were, as his obituary notices testified, appreciated very highly by a
  world-wide following of distinguished and capable admirers. The general
  public was suddenly made aware of him.</p>

  <p>It is rare that anyone outside the conventional areas of newspaper
  publicity produces so great a stir by dying; there were accounts of him in
  nearly every paper of importance from Oslo to New Zealand and from Buenos
  Aires to Japan&mdash; and the brief but admirable memoir by Sir Godfrey
  Cliffe gave the general reader a picture of an exceptionally simple, direct,
  devoted and energetic personality. There seems to have been only two
  extremely dissimilar photographs available for publication: an early one in
  which he looks like a blend of Shelley and Mr. Maxton, and a later one, a
  snapshot, in which he leans askew on his stick and talks to Lord Parmoor in
  the entrance hall of the Assembly. One of his lank hands is held out in a
  characteristic illustrative gesture.</p>

  <p>Incessantly laborious though he was, he could nevertheless find time to
  assist in, share and master all the broader problems that exercised his
  colleagues, and now they rushed forward with their gratitude. One noticeable
  thing in that posthumous eruption of publicity was the frequent
  acknowledgments of his aid and advice. Men were eager to testify to his
  importance and resentful at the public ignorance of his work. Three memorial
  volumes of his more important papers, reports, memoranda and addresses were
  arranged for and are still in course of publication.</p>

  <p>Personally, although I was asked to do so in several quarters, and though
  I was known to have had the honour of his friendship, I made no contribution
  to that obituary chorus. My standing in the academic world did not justify my
  writing him a testimonial, but under normal circumstances that would not have
  deterred me from an attempt to sketch something of his odd personal ease and
  charm. I did not do so, however, because I found myself in a posoootion of
  extraordinary embarrassment. His death was so unforeseen that we had embarked
  upon a very peculiar joint undertaking without making the slightest provision
  for that risk. It is only now after an interval of nearly three years, and
  after some very difficult discussions with his more intimate friends, that I
  have decided to publish the facts and the substance of this peculiar
  cooperation of ours.</p>

  <p>It concerns the matter of this present book. All this time I have been
  holding back a manuscript, or rather a collection of papers and writings,
  entrusted to me. It is a collection about which, I think, a considerable
  amount of hesitation was, and perhaps is still, justifiable. It is, or at
  least it professes to be, a Short History of the World for about the next
  century and a half. (I can quite understand that the reader will rub his eyes
  at these words and suspect the printer of some sort of agraphia.) But that is
  exactly what this manuscript is. It is a Short History of the Future. It is a
  modern Sibylline book. Only now that the events of three years have more than
  justified everything stated in this anticipatory history have I had the
  courage to associate the reputation of my friend with the incredible claims
  of this work, and to find a publisher for it.</p>

  <p>Let me tell very briefly what I know of its origin and how it came into my
  hands. I made the acquaintance of Dr. Raven, or to be more precise, he made
  mine, in the closing year of the war. It was before he left Whitehall for
  Geneva. He was always an eager amateur of ideas, and he had been attracted by
  some suggestions about money I had made in a scrappy little book of forecasts
  called What is Coming? published in 1916. In this I had thrown out the
  suggestion that the waste of resources in the war, combined with the
  accumulation of debts that had been going on, would certainly leave the world
  as a whole bankrupt, that is to say it would leave the creditor class in a
  position to strangle the world, and that the only method to clear up this
  world bankruptcy and begin again on a hopeful basis would be to scale down
  all debts impartially, by a reduction of the amount of gold in the pound
  sterling and proportionally in the dollar and all other currencies based on
  gold. It seemed to me then an obvious necessity. It was, I recognize now, a
  crude idea&mdash; evidently I had not even got away from the idea of
  intrinsically valuable money &mdash;but none of us in those days had had the
  educational benefit of the monetary and credit convulsions that followed the
  Peace of Versailles. We were without experience, it wasn't popular to think
  about money, and at best we thought like precocious children. Seventeen years
  later this idea of appreciating gold is accepted as an obvious suggestion by
  quite a number of people. Then it was received merely as the amateurish
  comment of an ignorant writer upon what was still regarded as the mysterious
  business of "monetary experts." But it attracted the attention of Raven, who
  came along to talk over that and one or two other post-war possibilities I
  had started, and so he made my acquaintance.</p>

  <p>Raven was as free from intellectual pompousness as William James; as
  candidly receptive to candid thinking. He could talk about his subject to an
  artist or a journalist; he would have talked to an errand boy if he thought
  he would get a fresh slant in that way. "Obvious" was the word he brought
  with him. "The thing, my dear fellow"&mdash;he called me my dear fellow in
  the first five minutes &mdash;"is so obvious that everybody will be too
  clever to consider it for a moment. Until it is belated. It is impossible to
  persuade anybody responsible that there is going to be a tremendous financial
  and monetary mix-up after this war. The victors will exact vindictive
  penalties and the losers of course will undertake to pay, but none of them
  realizes that money is going to do the most extraordinary things to them when
  they begin upon that. What they are going to do to each other is what
  occupies them, and what money is going to do to the whole lot of them is
  nobody's affair."</p>

  <p>I can still see him as he said that in his high-pitched remonstrating
  voice. I will confess that for perhaps our first half-hour, until I was
  accustomed to his flavour, I did not like him. He was too full, too sure, too
  rapid and altogether too vivid for my slower Anglo-Saxon make-up. I did not
  like the evident preparation of his talk, nor the fact that he assisted it by
  the most extraordinary gestures. He would not sit down; he limped about my
  room, peering at books and pictures while he talked in his cracked forced
  voice, and waving those long lean hands of his about almost as if he was
  swimming through his subject. I have compared him to Maxton plus Shelley,
  rather older, but at the first outset I was reminded of Svengali in Du
  Maurier's once popular Trilby. A shaven Svengali. I felt he was FOREIGN, and
  my instincts about foreigners are as insular as my principles are
  cosmopolitan. It always seemed to me a little irreconcilable that he was a
  Balliol scholar, and had been one of the brightest ornaments of our Foreign
  Office staff before he went to Geneva.</p>

  <p>At bottom I suppose much of our essential English shyness is an
  exaggerated wariness. We suspect the other fellow of our own moral
  subtleties. We restrain ourselves often to the point of insincerity. I am a
  rash man with a pen perhaps, but I am as circumspect and evasive as any other
  of my fellow countrymen when it comes to social intercourse. I found
  something almost indelicate in Raven's direct attack upon my ideas.</p>

  <p>He wanted to talk about my ideas beyond question. But at least equally he
  wanted to talk about his own. I had more than a suspicion that he had, in
  fact, come to me in order to talk to himself and hear how it
  sounded&mdash;against me as a sounding-board.</p>

  <p>He called me then a Dealer in the Obvious, and he repeated that not very
  flattering phrase on various occasions when we met. "You have," he said,
  "defects that are almost gifts: a rapid but inexact memory for particulars, a
  quick grasp of proportions, and no patience with detail. You hurry on to
  wholes. How men of affairs must hate you&mdash;if and when they hear of you!
  They must think you an awful mug, you know&mdash;and yet you get there!
  Complications are their life. YOU try to get all these complications out of
  the way. You are a stripper, a damned impatient stripper. I would be a
  stripper too if I hadn't the sort of job I have to do. But it is really
  extraordinarily refreshing to spend these occasional hours, stripping events
  in your company."</p>

  <p>The reader must forgive my egotism in quoting these comments upon myself;
  they are necessary if my relations with Raven are to be made clear and if the
  spirit of this book is to be understood.</p>

  <p>I was, in fact, an outlet for a definite mental exuberance of his which it
  had hitherto distressed him to suppress. In my presence he could throw off
  Balliol and the Foreign Office&mdash;or, later on, the Secretariat&mdash;and
  let himself go. He could become the Eastern European Cosmopolitan he was by
  nature and descent. I became, as it were, an imaginative boon companion for
  him, his disreputable friend, a sort of intelligent butt, his Watson. I got
  to like the relationship. I got used to his physical exoticism, his gestures.
  I sympathized more and more with his irritation and distress as the
  Conference at Versailles unfolded. My instinctive racial distrust faded
  before the glowing intensity of his intellectual curiosity. We found we
  supplemented each other. I had a ready unclouded imagination and he had
  knowledge. We would go on the speculative spree together.</p>

  <p>Among other gifted and original friends who, at all too rare intervals,
  honour me by coming along for a gossip, is Mr. J. W. Dunne, who years ago
  invented one of the earliest and most "different" of aeroplanes, and who has
  since done a very considerable amount of subtle thinking upon the
  relationship of time and space to consciousness. Dunne clings to the idea
  that in certain ways we may anticipate the future, and he has adduced a
  series of very remarkable observations indeed to support that in his
  well-known Experiment with Time. That book was published in 1927, and I found
  it so attractive and stimulating that I wrote about it in one or two articles
  that were syndicated very extensively throughout the world. It was so
  excitingly fresh.</p>

  <p>And among others who saw my account of this Experiment with Time, and who
  got the book and read it and then wrote to me about it, was Raven. Usually
  his communications to me were the briefest of notes, saying he would be in
  London, telling me of a change of address, asking about my movements, and so
  forth; but this was quite a long letter. Experiences such as Dunne's, he
  said, were no novelty to him. He could add a lot to what was told in the
  book, and indeed he could EXTEND the experience. The thing anticipated
  between sleeping and waking &mdash;Dunne's experiments dealt chiefly with the
  premonitions in the dozing moment between wakefulness and oblivion&mdash;need
  not be just small affairs of tomorrow or next week; they could have a longer
  range. If, that is, you had the habit of long-range thinking. But these were
  days when scepticism had to present a hard face to greedy superstition, and
  it was one's public duty to refrain from rash statements about these flimsy
  intimations, difficult as they were to distinguish from
  fantasies&mdash;except in one's own mind. One might sacrifice a lot of
  influence if one betrayed too lively an interest in this sort of thing.</p>

  <p>He wandered off into such sage generalizations and concluded abruptly. The
  letter had an effect of starting out to tell much more than he did.</p>

  <p>Then he turned up in London, dropped into my study unexpectedly and made a
  clean breast of it.</p>

  <p>"This Dunne business," he began.</p>

  <p>"Well?" said I.</p>

  <p>"He has a way of snatching the fleeting dream between unconscious sleep
  and waking."</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"He keeps a notebook by his bedside and writes down his dream the very
  instant he is awake."</p>

  <p>"That's the procedure."</p>

  <p>"And he finds that a certain percentage of his dream items
  are&mdash;sometimes quite plainly&mdash;anticipations of things that will
  come into his mind out of reality, days, weeks, and even years ahead."</p>

  <p>"That's Dunne."</p>

  <p>"It's nothing."</p>

  <p>"But how&mdash;nothing?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing to what I have been doing for a long time."</p>

  <p>"And that is&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>He stared at the backs of my books. It was amusing to find Raven for once
  at a loss for words.</p>

  <p>"Well?" I said.</p>

  <p>He turned and looked at me with a reluctant expression that broke into a
  smile. Then he seemed to rally his candour.</p>

  <p>"How shall I put it? I wouldn't tell anyone but you. For some years, off
  and on&mdash;between sleeping and waking&mdash;I've been&mdash;in
  effect&mdash;reading a book. A non-existent book. A dream book if you like.
  It's always the same book. Always. And it's a history."</p>

  <p>"Of the past?"</p>

  <p>"There's a lot about the past. With all sorts of things I didn't know and
  all sorts of gaps filled in. Extraordinary things about North India and
  Central Asia, for instance. And also&mdash;it goes on. It's going on. It
  keeps on going on."</p>

  <p>"Going on?"</p>

  <p>"Right past the present time."</p>

  <p>"Sailing away into the future?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Is it&mdash;is it a PAPER book?"</p>

  <p>"Not quite paper. Rather like that newspaper of your friend Brownlow. Not
  quite print as we know it. Vivid maps. And quite easy to read, in spite of
  the queer letters and spelling."</p>

  <p>He paused. "I know it's nonsense."</p>

  <p>He added. "It's frightfully real."</p>

  <p>"Do you turn the pages?"</p>

  <p>He thought for a moment. "No, I don't turn the pages. That would wake me
  up."</p>

  <p>"It just goes on?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Until you realize you are doing it?"</p>

  <p>"I suppose&mdash;yes, it is like that."</p>

  <p>"And then you wake up?"</p>

  <p>"Exactly. And it isn't there!"</p>

  <p>"And you are always READING?"</p>

  <p>"Generally&mdash;very definitely."</p>

  <p>"But at times?"</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;just the same as reading a book when one is awake. If the matter
  is vivid one SEES the events. As if one was looking at a moving picture on
  the page."</p>

  <p>"But the book is still there?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;always. I think it's there always."</p>

  <p>"Do you by any chance make notes?"</p>

  <p>"I didn't at first. Now I do."</p>

  <p>"At once?"</p>

  <p>"I write a kind of shorthand.... Do you know&mdash;I've piles of notes
  THAT high."</p>

  <p>He straddled my fireplace and stared at me.</p>

  <p>"Now you've told me," I said.</p>

  <p>"Now I've told you."</p>

  <p>"Illegible, my dear sir&mdash;except to me. You don't know my shorthand. I
  can hardly read it myself after a week or so. But lately I've been writing it
  out&mdash; some I've dictated.</p>

  <p>"You see," he went on, standing up and walking about my room, "if
  it's&mdash;a reality, it's the most important thing in the world. And I
  haven't an atom of proof. Not an atom. Do you&mdash;? Do you believe this
  sort of thing is possible?"</p>

  <p>"POSSIBLE?" I considered. "I'm inclined to think I do. Though what exactly
  this kind of thing may be, I don't know."</p>

  <p>"I can't tell anyone but you. How could I? Naturally they would say I had
  gone cranky&mdash;or that I was an impostor. You know the sort of row. Look
  at Oliver Lodge. Look at Charles Richet. It would smash my work, my position.
  And yet, you know, it's such credible stuff.... I tell you I believe in
  it."</p>

  <p>"If you wrote some of it out. If I could see some of it."</p>

  <p>"You shall."</p>

  <p>He seemed to be consulting my opinion. "The worst thing against it is that
  I always believe in what the fellow says. That's rather as though it was ME,
  eh?"</p>

  <p>He did not send me any of his notes, but when next I met him, it was at
  Berne, he gave me a spring-backed folder filled with papers. Afterwards he
  gave me two others. Pencilled sheets they were mostly, but some were
  evidently written at his desk in ink and perhaps fifty pages had been typed,
  probably from his dictation. He asked me to take great care of them, to read
  them carefully, have typed copies made and return a set to him. The whole
  thing was to be kept as a secret between us. We were both to think over the
  advisability of a possibly anonymous publication. And meanwhile events might
  either confirm or explode various statements made in this history and so set
  a definite value, one way or the other, upon its authenticity.</p>

  <p>Then he died.</p>

  <p>He died quite unexpectedly as the result of a sudden operation. Some
  dislocation connected with his marked spinal curvature had developed abruptly
  into an acute crisis.</p>

  <p>As soon as I heard of his death I hurried off to Geneva and told the story
  of the dream book to his heir and executor, Mr. Montefiore Renaud. I am
  greatly indebted to that gentleman for his courtesy and quick understanding
  of the situation. He was at great pains to get every possible scrap of
  material together and to place it all at my disposal. In addition to the
  three folders Raven had already given me there were a further folder in
  longhand and a drawerful of papers in his peculiar shorthand evidently
  dealing with this History. The fourth folder contained the material which
  forms the concluding book of this present work. The shorthand notes, of which
  even the pages were not numbered, have supplied the material for the
  penultimate book, which has had to be a compilation of my own. Generally,
  Raven seems to have scribbled down his impressions of the dream book as soon
  as he could, before the memory faded, and as he intended to recopy it all
  himself he had no consideration for any prospective reader. This material was
  just for his own use. It is a mixture of very cursive (and inaccurate)
  shorthand, and for proper names and so forth, longhand. Punctuation is
  indicated by gaps, and often a single word stands for a whole sentence and
  even a paragraph. About a third of the shorthand stuff was already
  represented by longhand or typescript copy in the folders. That was my
  Rosetta Stone. If it were not for the indications conveyed by that I do not
  think it would have been possible to decipher any of the remainder. As it is,
  I found it impossible to make a flowing narrative, altogether of a piece with
  the opening and closing parts of this history. Some passages came out fairly
  clear and then would come confusion and obscurity. I have transcribed what I
  could and written-up the intervals when transcription was hopeless. I think I
  have made a comprehensible story altogether of the course of events during
  the struggles and changes in world government that went on between 1980 and
  2059, at which date the Air Dictatorship, properly so called, gave place to
  that world-wide Modern State which was still flourishing when the history was
  published. The reader will find large gaps, or rather he will find large
  abbreviations, in that portion, but none that leave the main lines of the
  history of world consolidation in doubt.</p>

  <p>And now let me say a word or so more about the real value of this queer
  "Outline of the Future".</p>

  <p>Certain minor considerations weigh against the idea that this history that
  follows is merely the imaginative dreaming of a brilliant publicist. I put
  them before the reader, but I will not press them. First of all this history
  has now received a certain amount of confirmation. The latest part of the MS.
  dates from September 20th, 1930, and much of it is earlier. And yet it
  alludes explicitly to the death of Ivar Kreuger a year later, to the tragic
  kidnapping of the Lindbergh baby, which happened in the spring of 1932, to
  the Mollison world flights of the same year, to the American debt discussions
  in December 1932, to the Hitlerite régime in Germany, and Japanese invasion
  of China proper in 1933, the election of President Roosevelt II and the World
  Economic Conference in London. These anticipations in detail I find a little
  difficult to explain away. I do not think that they are of such a nature that
  they could have been foretold. They are not events that were deducible from
  any preceding situation. How could Raven have known about them in 1930?</p>

  <p>And another thing that troubles me much more than it will trouble the
  reader is the fact that there was no reason at all why Raven should have
  attempted a mystification upon me. There was no reason on earth or heaven why
  he should have lied about the way in which this material came to him and he
  wrote it down.</p>

  <p>If it were not for these considerations, I think I should be quite
  prepared to fall in with what will no doubt be the general opinion, that the
  writing of this History was deliberately chosen by Raven as an imaginative
  outlet. That it is indeed a work of fiction by a late member of the Geneva
  Secretariat with unusual opportunities for forming judgments upon the trend
  of things. Or, let us say, a conditional prophecy in the Hebrew manner
  produced in a quasi-inspired mood. The style in which it is written is
  recognizably Raven's style, and there are few of those differences in
  vocabulary and locutions that one might reasonably expect in our language a
  hundred and seventy odd years from now. On the other hand, the attitude
  revealed is entirely inconsistent with Raven's fully conscious public
  utterances. The idiom of thought at least is not his, whatever the idiom of
  expression. Either his marginal vision transcended his waking convictions or
  we have here a clear case of suppressions making their way to the surface. Is
  that what history is going to be?</p>

  <p>I must admit that at first, while I was still under the impression that
  the whole thing was a speculative exercise, I was tempted to annotate Raven's
  text rather extensively. I wanted to take a hand in the game. In fact I did
  some months' work upon it. Until my notes were becoming more bulky than his
  history. But when I revised them I came to the conclusion that many of them
  were fussy obtrusions and very few of them likely to be really helpful to an
  intelligent and well-informed contemporary reader. The more attracted he was
  by the book, the more likely he was to make his observations for himself; the
  less he appreciated it, the less he was likely to appreciate a superincumbent
  mass of elucidation. My notes might have proved as annoying as the
  pencillings one finds at times in public library books to-day. If the history
  is merely a speculative history, even then they would have been impertinent;
  if there is anything more in it than speculation, then they would be a very
  grave impertinence indeed. In the end I scrapped the entire accumulation.</p>

  <p>But I have had also to arrange these chapters in order, and that much
  intervention was unavoidable and must remain. I have had indeed to arrange
  and rearrange them after several trials, because they do not seem to have
  been read and written down by Raven in their proper chronological sequence. I
  have smoothed out the transitions. Later on I hope to publish a special
  edition of Raven's notes exactly as he left them.</p>

  <p>We begin here with what is evidently the opening of a fresh book in the
  history, though it was not actually the first paper in the folders handed to
  me. It reviews very conveniently the course of worldly events in recent
  years, and it does so in what is, to me, a novel and very persuasive way. It
  analyses the main factors of the great war from a new angle. From that review
  the story of the "Age of Frustration", in the opening years of which we are
  now living, flows on in a fairly consecutive fashion. Apart from this
  introduction the period covered by the actual narrative is roughly from about
  1929 A.D. to the end of the year 2105. The last recorded event is on New
  Year's Day 2106; there is a passing mention of the levelling of the remaining
  "skeletons" of the famous "Skyscrapers" of Lower New York on that date. The
  printing and publication probably occurred early in the new year;
  occurred&mdash;or should I write "will occur"?</p>

  <h2><a id="book1"
     name="book1">BOOK THE FIRST<br>
  TODAY AND TOMORROW: THE AGE OF FRUSTRATION DAWNS</a></h2>

  <h2><a id="chap1_01"
     name="chap1_01">1. &mdash; A CHRONOLOGICAL NOTE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries the story of
  mankind upon this planet undergoes a change of phase. It broadens out. It
  unifies. It ceases to be a tangle of more and more interrelated histories and
  it becomes plainly and consciously one history. There is a complete
  confluence of racial, social and political destinies. With that a vision of
  previously unsuspected possibilities opens to the human imagination. And that
  vision brings with it an immense readjustment of ideas.</p>

  <p>The first phase of that readjustment is necessarily destructive. The
  conceptions of life and obligation that have served and satisfied even the
  most vigorous and intelligent personalities hitherto, conceptions that were
  naturally partial, sectarian and limited, begin to lose, decade by decade,
  their credibility and their directive force. They fade, they become
  attenuated. It is an age of increasing mental uneasiness, of forced beliefs,
  hypocrisy, cynicism, abandon and impatience. What has been hitherto a final
  and impenetrable background of conviction in the rightness of the methods of
  behaviour characteristic of the national or local culture of each individual,
  becomes, as it were, a dissolving and ragged curtain. Behind it appear, vague
  and dim at first, and refracted and distorted by the slow dissolution of the
  traditional veils, the intimations of the type of behaviour necessary to that
  single world community in which we live to-day.</p>

  <p>Until the Chronological Institute has completed its present labours of
  revision and defined the cardinal dates in our social evolution, it is best
  to refer our account of the development of man's mind and will throughout
  this hectic period of human experience to the clumsy and irrelevant
  computation by centuries before and after the Christian Era, that is still
  current. As we have explained more fully in a previous book*, we inherit this
  system of historical pigeonholes from Christendom; that arbitrary chequerwork
  of hundred-year blocks was imposed upon the entire Mediterranean and Atlantic
  literatures for two thousand years, and it still distorts the views of
  history of all but the alertest minds. The young student needs to be
  constantly on his guard against its false divisions. As Peter Lightfoot has
  remarked, we talk of the "eighteenth century", and we think of fashions and
  customs and attitudes that are characteristic of a period extending from the
  Treaty of Westphalia in C.E. [Christian Era] 1642 to the Napoleonic collapse
  in C.E. 1815; we talk of the "nineteenth century", and the pictures and
  images evoked are those of the gas-lighting and steam-transport era, from
  after the distressful years of post-Napoleonic recovery to the immense shock
  of the World War in C.E. 1914. The phase "twentieth century", again, calls
  forth images of the aeroplane, the electrification of the world and so forth;
  but an aeroplane was an extremely rare object in the air until 1914 (the
  first got up in 1905), and the replacement of the last steam railway train
  and the last steamship was not completed until the nineteen-forties. It is a
  tiresome waste of energy to oblige each generation of young minds to learn
  first of all in any unmeaning pattern of centuries and then to correct that
  first crude arrangement, so that this long-needed revision of our chronology
  is one that will be very welcome to every teacher. Then from the very outset
  he or she will be able to block out the story of our race in significant
  masses.</p>

  <p>* [Nothing of this is to be found in Raven's notes.&mdash;ED.]</p>

  <p>The Chronological Institute is setting about its task with a helpful
  publicity, inviting discussion from every angle. It is proposing to divide up
  as much of the known history of our race as is amenable to annual reckoning,
  into a series of eras of unequal length. Naturally the choice of these eras
  is the cause of some extremely lively and interesting interchanges; most of
  us have our own private estimates of the values of events, and many issues
  affecting the earlier civilized communities remain in a state of animated
  unsettlement. Our chronology is now fairly sure as to the year for most
  important events in the last 4,000 years, and, thanks largely to the minute
  and patient labours of the Selwyn-Cornford Committee for Alluvial Research,
  to the decade for another hundred centuries. So far as the last 3,000 years
  are concerned, little doubt remains now that the main dividing points to be
  adopted will be FIRST the epoch of Alexander and the Hellenic conquests which
  will begin the phase of the great Helleno-Latin monetary imperialism in the
  western world, the Helleno-Latin Era. This will commence at the crossing of
  the Hellespont by Alexander the Great and end either with the Battle of the
  Yarmuk (636 C.E.) or the surrender of Jerusalem to the Caliph Omar (638
  C.E.). NEXT will come the epoch of Moslem and Mongol pressure on the West
  which opened the era of feudal Christendom vis-à-vis with feudal Islam: the
  Era of Asiatic Predominance. This ends with the Battle of Lepanto (1571
  C.E.). Then THIRDLY there will follow the epoch of the Protestant and the
  Catholic (counter) Reformations, which inaugurated the era of the competing
  sovereign states with organized standing armies: the Era of European
  Predominance, or, as it may also be called, the Era of National Sovereignty.
  Finally comes the catastrophe of the World War of 1914, when the outward
  drive of the new economic methods the Atlantic civilizations had developed
  gave way under the internal stresses of European nationalism. That war, and
  its long-drawn sequelae, released the human mind to the potentialities and
  dangers of an imperfectly Europeanized world&mdash;a world which had
  unconsciously become one single interlocking system, while still obsessed by
  the Treaty of Westphalia and the idea of competing sovereign states. This
  mental shock and release marks the beginning of the Era of the Modern State.
  The opening phase of this latest era is this Age of Frustration with which we
  are now about to deal. That is the first age of the Era of the Modern State.
  A second age, but not a new era, began with the Declaration of Mégève which
  was accepted by the general commonsense of mankind forty-seven years ago.
  This closed the Age of Frustration, which lasted therefore a little short of
  a century and a half.</p>

  <p>The date upon the title-page for the first publication of this History is
  C.E. 2106. Before many editions have been exhausted that will be changed to
  Modern Era (M.E.) 192 or M.E. 189 or M.E. 187, according to whether our
  chronologists decide upon 1914, the date of the outbreak of the Great War, or
  1917, the beginning of the social revolution in Russia, or 1919, the signing
  of the Treaty of Versailles, as the conclusive opening of the Age of
  Frustration and the conflict for world unity. The second date seems at
  present to be the more practicable one.</p>

  <p>In C.E. 1914 the concept of an organized world order did not seem to be
  within the sphere of human possibility; in C.E. 1919 it was an active power
  in a steadily increasing proportion of human brains. The Modern State had
  been conceived. It was germinating. One system, the Soviet system in Russia,
  was already claiming to be a world system. To most of the generation which
  suffered it, the Great War seemed to be purely catastrophe and loss; to us
  who see those hideous years in perspective and in proportion to the general
  dulness and baseness of apprehension out of which that conflict arose, the
  destruction of life and substance, unprecedented as they were, has none of
  that overwhelming quality. We see it as a clumsy, involuntary release from
  outworn assumptions by their reduction to tragic absurdity, and as a
  practically unavoidable step therefore in the dialectic of human destiny.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap1_02"
     name="chap1_02">2. &mdash; HOW THE IDEA AND HOPE OF THE<br>
  MODERN WORLD STATE FIRST APPEARED</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The essential difference between the world before the Great
  War and the world after it lay in this, that before that storm of distress
  and disillusionment the clear recognition that a worldwide order and
  happiness, in spite of contemporary distresses, was within the reach of
  mankind was confined to a few exceptional persons, while after the
  catastrophe it had spread to an increasing multitude, it had become a
  desperate hope and desire, and at last a working conviction that made
  organized mass action possible.</p>

  <p>Even those who apprehended this idea before the epoch of the Great War
  seem to have propounded it with what impresses us today as an almost
  inexplicable timidity and feebleness. Apart from the great star of Shelley,
  which shines the brighter as his successors dwindle in perspective, there is
  a flavour of unreality about all these pre-war assertions of a possible world
  order. In most of them the Victorian terror of "extravagance" is dominant,
  and the writer simpers and laughs at his own suggestions in what was
  evidently supposed to be a very disarming manner. Hardly any of these
  prophets dared believe in their own reasoning. Maxwell Brown has recently
  disinterred a pamphlet, The Great Analysis,* dated 1912, in which a shrewd
  and reasoned forecast of the primary structure of the Modern State, quite
  amazingly prescient for the time, was broached with the utmost timidity,
  without even an author's name. It was a scheme to revolutionize the world,
  and the writer would not put his name to it, he confesses, because it might
  make him ridiculous.</p>

  <p>* (Here for once the editor knows better than the writer of the history.
  This pamphlet was written by William Archer, the dramatic critic, and
  reprinted under its author's name with a preface by Gilbert Murray in 1931.
  Apparently the book collectors of the years ahead are going to miss this
  book.&mdash;ED.)</p>

  <p>Maxwell Brown's entertaining Modern State Prophets Before the Great War is
  an exhaustive study of the psychological processes by which this idea, which
  is now the foundation of our contemporary life, gradually ousted its opposite
  of combative patriotism and established itself as a practicable and necessary
  form of action for men of good-will a century and a half ago. He traces the
  idea almost to its germ; he shows that its early manifestations, so far from
  being pacific, were dreams of universal conquest. He tells of its age-long
  struggle with everyday usage and practical commonsense. In the first of his
  huge supplementary volumes he gives thousands of quotations going back far
  beyond the beginnings of the Christian Era. All the monotheistic religions
  were, in spirit, world-state religions. He examines the Tower of Babel myth
  as the attempt of some primordial cosmopolitan, some seer before the dawn, to
  account for the divisions of mankind. (There is strong reason now for
  ascribing this story to Emesal Gudeka of Nippur, the early Sumerian
  fabulist.)</p>

  <p>Maxwell Brown shows how the syncretic religious developments, due to the
  growth of the early empires and the official pooling of gods, led necessarily
  to monotheism. From at least the time of Buddha onward, the sentiment, if not
  the living faith, in human brotherhood, always existed somewhere in the
  world. But its extension from a mere sentiment and a fluctuating sympathy for
  the stranger to the quality of a practicable enterprise was a very recent
  process indeed. The necessary conditions were not satisfied.</p>

  <p>In the briefer studies of human innovations that preceded his more
  important contributions to human history, Maxwell Brown has shown how for the
  past ten thousand years at least, since the Cro-Magnards stamped their
  leather robes and tents, the art of printing reappeared and disappeared again
  and again, never culminating in the printed book and all its consequences,
  never obtaining a primary importance in human doings, until the fifteenth
  century (C.E.); he has assembled the evidence for man's repeated abortive
  essays in flying, from the fourth dynasty gliders recently found at
  Bedrashen, the shattered Yu-chow machine and the interesting wreckage,
  ornaments and human remains found last year in Mirabella Bay. (These last
  were first remarked in 2104 C.E. after an earthquake in the deep sea
  photographs of the survey aeroplane Crawford, and they were subsequently
  sought and recovered by the divers of the submarine Salvemini belonging to
  the Naples Biological Station. They have now been identified by Professor
  Giulio Marinetti as the remains of the legendary glider of Daedalus and
  Icarus.) Maxwell Brown has also traced the perpetual discovery and
  rediscovery of America from the days of the Aalesund tablets and the early
  Chinese inscriptions in the caves near Bahia Coqui to the final establishment
  of uninterrupted communications across the Atlantic by the Western Europeans
  in the fifteenth century C.E. In all there are sixteen separate ineffectual
  discoveries of America either from the east or from the west now on record,
  and there may have been many others that left no trace behind them.</p>

  <p>These earlier cases of human enterprise and inadequacy help us to
  understand the long struggle of the Age of Frustration and the difficulty our
  ancestors found in achieving what is now so obviously the only sane
  arrangement of human affairs upon this planet.</p>

  <p>The fruitlessness of all these premature inventions is very easily
  explained. First in the case of the Transatlantic passage; either the earlier
  navigators who got to America never got back, or, if they did get back, they
  were unable to find the necessary support and means to go again before they
  died, or they had had enough of hardship, or they perished in a second
  attempt. Their stories were distorted into fantastic legends and
  substantially disbelieved. It was, indeed, a quite futile adventure to get to
  America until the keeled sailing ship, the science of navigation, and the
  mariner's compass had been added to human resources.</p>

  <p>Then again, in the matter of printing, it was only when the Chinese had
  developed the systematic manufacture of abundant cheap paper sheets in
  standard sizes that the printed book&mdash;and its consequent release of
  knowledge&mdash;became practically possible. Finally the delay in the
  attainment of flying was inevitable because before men could progress beyond
  precarious gliding it was necessary for metallurgy to reach a point at which
  the internal combustion engine could be made. Until then they could build
  nothing strong enough and light enough to battle with the eddies of the
  air.</p>

  <p>In an exactly parallel manner, the conception of one single human
  community organized for collective service to the common weal had to wait
  until the rapid evolution of the means of communication could arrest and
  promise to defeat the disintegrative influence of geographical separation.
  That rapid evolution came at last in the nineteenth century, and it has been
  described already in a preceding chapter of this world history.* Steam power,
  oil power, electric power, the railway, the steamship, the aeroplane,
  transmission by wire and aerial transmission followed each other very
  rapidly. They knit together the human species as it had never been knit
  before. Insensibly, in less than a century, the utterly impracticable became
  not merely a possible adjustment but an urgently necessary adjustment if
  civilization was to continue.</p>

  <p>* [Not Recorded by Raven.&mdash;ED.]</p>

  <p>Now the cardinal prominence of the Great War in history lies in this, that
  it demonstrated the necessity of that adjustment. It was never considered to
  be necessary before. Recognition lagged behind accomplishment. None of the
  pre-war World-State Prophets betrays any sense of necessity. They make their
  polite and timid gestures towards human unity as something nice and desirable
  indeed but anything but imperative. The clearest demand for world-wide
  cooperation before the war, came from the Second International. And even
  after the war, and after the vague and vacillating adumbration of a federal
  super-state by the League of Nations at Geneva, most of even the most
  advanced writers seem to have been still under the impression that the utmost
  adjustment needed was some patching up of the current system so as to prevent
  or mitigate war and restrain the insurrectionary urge of the
  unprosperous.</p>

  <p>Even the Communist movement which, as we had told already, had been able
  by a conspiracy of accidents to seize upon Russia and demonstrate the value
  of its theories there, lapsed from, rather than advanced towards,
  cosmopolitan socialism. Its theories, as we have shown, were hopelessly
  inadequate for its practical needs. The development of its ideology was
  greatly hampered by the conservative dogmatism imposed upon it by the
  incurable egotism of Marx. His intolerance, his innate bad manners, his vain
  insistence that he had produced a final doctrine to put beside Darwinism,
  cast a long shadow of impatience and obduracy upon the subsequent development
  of Communism. He was bitterly jealous of the Utopian school of socialism, and
  so, until Lenin faced the urgencies of power, the "orthodox" Marxist took a
  quite idiotic pride in a planless outlook. "Overthrow capitalism", he said,
  and what could happen but millennial bliss? Communism insisted indeed upon
  the necessity of economic socialization but&mdash; until it attained power in
  Russia&mdash;without a glance at its technical difficulties. It produced its
  belated and ill-proportioned Five Year Plan only in 1928 C.E., eleven years
  after its accession to power. Until then it had no comprehensive working
  scheme whatever for the realization of socialism. Thrown back on experiment,
  it was forced to such desperately urgent manoeuvres, improvisations and
  changes of front, and defended by such tawdry and transparent apologetics,
  that the general world movement passed out of its ken.</p>

  <p>The reader of this world history knows already how the moral and
  intellectual force of the Communist Party proved unequal, after the death of
  Lenin, to control or resist the dictatorship of that forcible, worthy,
  devoted and limited man, the Georgian, Stalin. The premature death of the
  creative and adaptable Lenin and the impatient suppression by Stalin of such
  intelligent, troublesome, but necessary types as Trotsky&mdash;a man who, but
  for lack of tact and essential dignity, might well have been Lenin's
  successor&mdash;crippled whatever hope there may have been that the Modern
  State would first emerge in Russia. Terrible are the faithful disciples of
  creative men. Lenin relaxed and reversed the dogmatism of Marx, Stalin made
  what he imagined to be Leninism into a new and stiffer dogmatism. Thereafter
  the political doctrinaire dominated and crippled the technician in a struggle
  that cried aloud for technical competence. Just as theological disputes
  impoverished and devastated Europe through the long centuries of Christendom,
  and reduced the benefits of its unifying influence to zero, so in Russia
  efficiency of organization was prevented by the pedantries of political
  theorists. The young were trained to a conceit and a xenophobia,
  indistinguishable in its practical effects from the gross patriotism of such
  countries as France, Germany, Italy or Scotland.</p>

  <p>Because of this subordination of its mental development to Politics,
  Russia passed into a political and social phase comparable, as Rostovtzeff
  pointed out at the time in his Social and Economic History of the Roman
  Empire, in its universal impoverishment and its lack of any critical vigour,
  to the well-meaning but devitalizing autocracy of the Emperor Diocletian.
  From its very start the Russian revolution failed in its ambition to lead
  mankind. Its cosmopolitanism lasted hardly longer than the cosmopolitanism of
  the great French revolution a dozen decades earlier.</p>

  <p>This almost inevitable lag of the constructive movement in Russia behind
  Western developments was foreseen by the shrewd and penetrating brain of
  Lenin even in the phase of its apparent leadership (see No. 3090 in the
  thirteenth series of the Historical Documents Collection, Left Wing
  Communism). But his observation found little or no echo in the incurably
  illiberal thought of the Marxian tradition.</p>

  <p>It was in Western Europe especially that the conception of the organized
  and disciplined World-State as a revolutionary objective, ultimately grew to
  its full proportions. At first it grew obscurely. In 1933, any observer might
  have been misled by the fact of the Fascist régime in Italy, by the tumult of
  the Nazi party in Germany, by similar national-socialist movements in other
  countries, and by the increase in tariff barriers and other restraints upon
  trade everywhere, to conclude that the cosmopolitan idea was everywhere in
  retreat before the obsessions of race, creed and nationalism. Yet all the
  while the germs of the Modern State were growing, everywhere its votaries
  were learning and assembling force.</p>

  <p>It needed the financial storm of the years 1928 and 1929 C.E. and the
  steadily progressive collapse of the whole world's economic life, of which
  this storm was the prelude, to give the World-State prophets the courage of
  their convictions. Then indeed they began to speak out. Instead of the
  restrained, partial and inconclusive criticism of public affairs which had
  hitherto contented them, they now insisted plainly upon the need of a world-
  wide reconstruction, that is to say of a world revolution&mdash;though
  "revolution" was still a word they shirked. The way in which this increased
  definition of aim and will came about is characteristic of the changing
  quality of social life. It was not that one or two outstanding men suddenly
  became audible and conspicuous as leaders in this awakening. There were no
  leaders. It was a widespread movement in human thought.</p>

  <p>The conclusions upon which intelligent people were converging may be
  briefly stated. They had arrived at the realization that human society had
  become one indivisible economic system with novel and enormous potentialities
  of well-being. By 1931 C.E. this conception becomes visible even in the
  obstinately intellectualist mind of France&mdash;for example, in the parting
  speech to America of an obscure and transitory French Prime Minister, Laval,
  who crossed the Atlantic on some new undiscoverable mission in that year; and
  we find it promptly echoed by such prominent loud speakers as President
  Hoover of America and Mr. Ramsay MacDonald the British Prime Minister.</p>

  <p>That idea at any rate had already become sufficiently popular for the
  politicians to render it lip service. But it was still only the intelligent
  minority who went on to the logical consequences of its realization; that is
  to say, the necessity of disavowing the sovereignty of contemporary
  governments, of setting up authoritative central controls to supplement or
  supersede them, and of putting the production of armaments, the production of
  the main economic staples and the protection of workers from destructive
  under-payment, beyond the reach of profit-seeking manipulation.</p>

  <p>Yet by 1932-33 this understanding minority was speaking very plainly.
  These immense changes were no longer being presented as merely desirable
  things; they were presented as urgently necessary things if civilization was
  to be saved from an immense catastrophe. And not merely saved. The
  alternative to disaster, they saw even then, was not just a bleak and
  terrified security. That was the last thing possible. There was no
  alternative to disorder and wretchedness, but "such an abundance, such a
  prosperity and richness of opportunity", as man had never known before.
  (These words are quoted from a Scottish newspaper of the year 1929.)
  Enlightened people in 1932 C.E. were as assured of the possibility of world
  order, universal sufficiency and ever increasing human vitality as are we who
  live to-day in ample possession of our lives amidst the practical realization
  of that possibility.</p>

  <p>Clearness of vision did not make for the happiness of the enlightened.
  Their minds were tormented not simply by contemporary fears and miseries, but
  by the sure knowledge of a possible world of free activity within the reach
  of man and, as it were, magically withheld. They saw hundreds of millions of
  lives cramped and crippled, meagrely lived, sacrificed untimely, and they
  could not see any primary necessity for this blighting and starvation of
  human life. They saw youthful millions drifting to lives of violence,
  mutilation and premature and hideous deaths. And beyond was our security, our
  eventfulness and our freedom.</p>

  <p>Maxwell Brown, in a chapter called "Tantalus 1932", cites forty instances
  of these realizations. But the legendary Tantalus was put within apparent
  reach of the unattainable by the inexorable decrees of the gods. Mankind was
  under no such pitiless destiny. The world-wide Modern State shone bright upon
  the living imaginations of our race within a decade of the Great War,
  absurdly near, fantastically out of reach. For a century of passionate
  confusion and disorder, that modern state was not to be released from
  potentiality into actuality.</p>

  <p>It is to the story of these battling, lost and suffering generations, the
  "generations of the half light", that we must now proceed.</p>

  <p>When now we look back to the scattered and diverse individuals who first
  give expression to this idea of the modern World-State which was dawning upon
  the human intelligence, when we appraise their first general efforts towards
  its realization, we need, before we can do them anything like justice, to
  attempt some measure of the ignorances, prejudices and other inertias, the
  habits of concession and association, the herd love and the herd fear, with
  which they had to struggle not only in the society in which they found
  themselves, but within themselves. It is not a conflict of light and darkness
  we have to describe; it is the struggle of the purblind among the blind. We
  have to realize that for all that they were haunted by a vision of the
  civilized world of to-day, they still belonged not to our age but to their
  own. The thing imagined in their minds was something quite distinct from
  their present reality. Maxwell Brown has devoted several chapters, and a
  third great supplementary volume, to a special selection of early Modern
  State Prophets who followed public careers. He showed conclusively that in
  the third and fourth decades of the twentieth century (C.E.) there was a
  rapidly increasing number of men and women with a clear general conception of
  the possibilities of the modern world. He gives their written and spoken
  words, often astoundingly prescient and explicit. And then he traces out the
  tenor of their lives subsequent to these utterances. The discrepancy of
  belief and effort is a useful and indeed a startling reminder of the
  conditional nature of the individual life.</p>

  <p>As he writes: "In the security and serenity of the study, these men and
  women could see plainly. In those hours of withdrawal, the fragile delicate
  brain matter could escape from immediacy, apprehended causation in four
  dimensions, reach forward to the permanent values of social events in the
  space-time framework. But even to the study there penetrated the rumble of
  the outer disorder. And directly the door was opened, forthwith the uproar of
  contemporary existence, the carnival, the riot, the war and the market, beat
  in triumphantly. The raging question of what had to be done that day,
  scattered the fine thought of our common destiny to the four winds of
  heaven."</p>

  <p>Maxwell Brown adds a vivid illustration to this passage. It is the
  facsimile of the first draft by Peter Raut, the American progressive leader,
  of the Revolutionary Manifesto of 1937. It was indisputably a very inspiring
  document in its time and Raut gave the last proof of loyalty to the best in
  his mind, by a courageous martyrdom. But in the margin of this draft one's
  attention is caught by a maze of little figures; little sums in
  multiplication and addition. By his almost inspired gift for evidence and
  through the industry of his group of research assistants, Maxwell Brown has
  been able to demonstrate exactly what these sums were. They show that even
  while Raut, so far as his foresight permitted, was planning our new world,
  his thoughts were not wholly fixed on that end. They wandered. For a time the
  manifesto was neglected while he did these sums. He was gambling in
  industrial equities, and a large and active portion of his brain was
  considering whether the time had arrived to sell.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap1_03"
     name="chap1_03">3. &mdash; THE ACCUMULATING DISPROPORTIONS<br>
  OF THE OLD ORDER</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Let us consider some of the main appearances that disposed
  many minds to expect a world community in the early twentieth century. In the
  first place a very considerable financial unity had been achieved. The credit
  of the City of London ran to the ends of the earth and the gold sovereign was
  for all practical purposes a world coin, exchangeable locally for local
  expenditure within relatively slight fluctuations. Economic life was becoming
  very generalized. Over great areas trade moved with but small impediments,
  and the British still hoped to see their cosmopolitan conception of Free
  Trade accepted by the whole world. The International Institute of Agriculture
  in Rome was developing an annual census of staple production and reaching out
  towards a world control of commodity transport. Considerable movements and
  readjustments of population were going on, unimpeded by any government
  interference. Swarms of Russian Poles, for instance, drifted into Eastern
  Germany for the harvest work and returned; hundreds of thousands of Italians
  went to work in the United States for a few years and then came back with
  their earnings to their native villages. An ordinary traveller might go all
  over the more settled parts of the earth and never be asked for a passport
  unless he wanted to obtain a registered letter at a post office or otherwise
  prove his identity.</p>

  <p>A number of minor but significant federal services had also come into
  existence and had a sound legal standing throughout the world, the Postal
  Union for example. Before 1914 C.E. a written document was delivered into the
  hands of the addressee at almost every point upon the planet, almost as
  surely as, if less swiftly than, it is to-day. (The Historical Documents
  Board has recently reprinted a small book, International Government, prepared
  for the little old Fabian Society during the Great War period by L. S. Woolf,
  which gives a summary of such arrangements. He lists twenty-three important
  world unions dealing at that time with trade, industry, finance,
  communications, health, science, art, literature, drugs, brothels, criminals,
  emigration and immigration and minor political affairs.) These world-wide
  cooperations seemed &mdash;more particularly to the English-speaking
  peoples&mdash;to presage a direct and comparatively smooth transition from
  the political patchwork of the nineteenth century, as the divisions of the
  patchwork grew insensibly fainter, to a stable confederation of mankind. The
  idea of a coming World-State was quite familiar at the time&mdash;one finds
  it, for instance, as early as Lord Tennyson's Locksley Hall (published in
  1842); but there was no effort whatever to achieve it, and indeed no sense of
  the need of such effort. The World-State was expected to come about
  automatically by the inherent forces in things.</p>

  <p>That belief in some underlying benevolence in uncontrolled events was a
  common error, one might almost say THE common error, of the time. It affected
  every school of thought. In exactly the same fashion the followers of Marx
  (before the invigorating advent of Lenin and the Bolshevist reconstruction of
  Communism) regarded their dream of world communism as inevitable, and the
  disciples of Herbert Spencer found a benevolent Providence in "free
  competition". "Trust Evolution", said the extreme Socialist and the extreme
  Individualist, as piously as the Christians put their trust in God. It was
  the Bolshevik movement in the twentieth century which put will into
  Communism. The thought of the nineteenth century revolutionary and
  reactionary alike was saturated with that confident irresponsible laziness.
  As Professor K. Chandra Sen has remarked, hope in the Victorian period was
  not a stimulant but an opiate.</p>

  <p>We who live in a disciplined order, the chastened victors of a hard-
  fought battle, understand how superficial and unsubstantial were all those
  hopeful appearances. The great processes of mechanical invention, which have
  been described in our general account of the release of experimental science
  from deductive intellectualism, were increasing the power and range of every
  operating material force quite irrespective of its fitness or unfitness for
  the new occasions of mankind. With an equal impartiality they were bringing
  world-wide understanding and world-wide massacre into the range of human
  possibility.</p>

  <p>It was through no fault of these inventors and investigators that the new
  opportunities they created were misused. That was outside their range. They
  had as yet no common culture of their own. Nor, since each worked in his own
  field, were they responsible for the fragmentary irregularity of their
  discoveries. Biological and especially social invention were lagging far
  behind the practical advances of the exacter, simpler sciences. Their
  application was more difficult; the matters they affected were so much more
  deeply embedded in ordinary use and wont, variation was more intimate,
  novelties could not be inserted with the same freedom. It was easy to
  supplant the coach and horses on the macadamized road by the steam-engine or
  the railway, because it was not necessary to do anything to the road or the
  coach and horses to bring about the change. They were just left alone to run
  themselves out as the railroad (and later the automobile on the rubber-glass
  track) superseded them. But men cannot set up new social institutions, new
  social and political and industrial relationships, side by side with the old
  in that fashion. It must be an altogether tougher and slower job. It is a
  question not of ousting but of reconstruction. The old must be converted into
  the new without ceasing for a moment to be a going concern. The over-running
  of the biologically old by the mechanically new, due to these differences in
  timing, was inevitable, and it reached its maximum in the twentieth
  century.</p>

  <p>A pathological analogy may be useful here. In the past, before the
  correlation of development in living organisms began to be studied, people
  used to suffer helplessly and often very dreadfully from all sorts of
  irregularities of growth in their bodies. The medical services of the time,
  such as they were, were quite unable to control them. One of these, due to
  what is called the Nurmi ratios in the blood, was a great overproduction of
  bone, either locally or generally. The suffered gradually underwent
  distortion into a clumsy caricature of his former self; his features became
  coarse and massive, his skull bones underwent a monstrous expansion; the
  proportions of his limbs altered, and the leverage of his muscles went askew.
  He was made to look grotesque; he was crippled and at last killed. Something
  strictly parallel happened to human society in the hundred years before the
  Great War. Under the stimulus of mechanical invention and experimental
  physics it achieved, to pursue our metaphor, a hypertrophy of bone, muscle
  and stomach, without any corresponding enlargement of its nervous
  controls.</p>

  <p>Long before the Great War this progressive disproportion had been dimly
  recognized by many observers. The favourite formula was to declare that
  "spiritual"&mdash;for the naïve primordial opposition of spirit and matter
  was still accepted in those days&mdash;had not kept pace with "material"
  advance. This was usually said with an air of moral superiority to the world
  at large. Mostly there was a vague implication that if these other people
  would only refrain from using modern inventions so briskly, or go to church
  more, or marry earlier and artlessly, or read a more "spiritual" type of
  literature, or refrain from mixed bathing, or work harder and accept lower
  wages, or be more respectful and obedient to constituted authority, all might
  yet be well. Beyond this sort of thing there was little recognition of the
  great and increasing disharmonies of the social corpus until after the Great
  War.</p>

  <p>The young reader will ask, "But where was the Central Observation Bureau?
  Where was the professorial and student body which should have been recording
  these irregularities and producing plans for adjustment?"</p>

  <p>There was no Central Observation Bureau. That did not exist for another
  century. That complex organization of discussion, calculation, criticism and
  forecast was undreamt of. Those cities of thought, full of serene activities,
  came into existence only after the organization of the Record and Library
  Network under the Air Dictatorship between 2010 and 2030. Even the mother
  thought-city, the World Encyclopaedia Establishment, was not founded until
  2012. In the early twentieth century there was still no adequate estimate of
  economic forces and their social reactions. There were only a few score
  professors and amateurs of these fundamentally important studies scattered
  throughout the earth. They were scattered in every sense; even their
  communications were unsystematic. They had no powers of enquiry, no adequate
  statistics, little prestige; few people heeded what they thought or said.</p>

  <p>Maybe they deserved nothing better. They bickered stupidly with and
  discredited each other. They ignored or wilfully misunderstood each other. It
  is impossible to read such social and economic literature as the period
  produced without realizing the extraordinary backwardness of that side of the
  world's intellectual life. It is difficult to believe nowadays that the
  writers of these publications, at once tediously copious and incredibly
  jejune, were living at the same time as the lively multitude of workers in
  the experimental sciences which were daily adding to and reshaping knowledge
  to achieve fresh practical triumphs. From 1812 C.E., when public gas-lighting
  was first organized, to the outbreak of the Great War, while the world was
  being made over anew by gas, by steam, by oil, and then by the swift headlong
  development of electrical science, while the last terrae incognitae were
  being explored and mapped, while a multitude of hitherto unthought-of
  elements and compounds and hundreds of thousands of new substances were
  coming into use, while epidemic diseases were being restrained and driven
  back, while the death rate was being halved, and the average duration of life
  increased by a score of years, the social and political sciences remained
  practically stagnant and unserviceable. Throughout that century of material
  achievement there is no single instance of the successful application of a
  social, economic or educational generalization.</p>

  <p>Because of this belatedness of the social sciences, the progressive
  dislocation of the refined if socially limited and precarious civilization of
  the more advanced of the eighteenth and nineteenth century sovereign states
  went on without any effectual contemporary understanding of what was
  straining it to pieces. The Europeans and the Americans of the early
  twentieth century apprehended the social and political forces that ravaged
  their lives hardly more clearly than the citizens of the Roman Empire during
  its collapse. Plenty and the appearance of security HAPPENED; then débâcle
  HAPPENED. There was no analysis of operating causes. For years even quite
  bold and advanced thinkers were chased by events. They did not grasp what was
  occurring at the time. They only realized what had really occurred long
  afterwards. And so they never foresaw. There was no foresight, and therefore
  still less could there be any understanding control.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap1_04"
     name="chap1_04">4. &mdash;EARLY ATTEMPTS TO UNDERSTAND AND<br>
  DEAL WITH THESE DISPROPORTIONS; THE<br>
  CRITICISMS OF KARL MARX AND HENRY GEORGE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">There are, however, one or two exceptions to this general
  absence of diagnosis in the affairs of the nineteenth and twentieth century
  of the Christian Era, which even the student of general history cannot
  ignore. Prominent among them is the analysis and forecasts of economic
  development made by Karl Marx and his associates.</p>

  <p>In any case Marxism would have demanded our attention as a curious
  contemporary realization of the self-destroying elements in the business
  methods of the nineteenth century; but its accidental selection as the
  ostensible creed of revolutionary Russia after the Tzarist collapse gives it
  an almost primary importance in the history of kinetic ideas.</p>

  <p>Karl Marx (1818-1883) was the son of a christianized Jewish lawyer of
  Treves, of considerable social pretensions; he had an excellent university
  career at Bonn and Berlin, assimilated the radical thought of his time and
  became the lifelong friend of the far more modest and gifted Friedrich Engels
  (1820-1895), a Lancashire calico dealer. Under the inspiration of Engels and
  the English socialist movement of Robert Owen, Marx elaborated the theory of
  economic development which is the substance of Marxism. It is embodied in a
  huge unfinished work, Das Kapital, and summarized in a Communist Manifesto
  (1848) drawn up by Engels and himself. (These, and indeed all his writings,
  together with an able digest and summary, are to be found in the Library of
  Historical Thought, vols. 17252-9.) His chief merit lies in his clear
  recognition of the ultimate dependence of social and political forms and
  reactions upon physical necessity. ("The Materialist Conception of History".)
  His chief fault was his insane hatred of the middle classes (bourgeoisie),
  due mainly to his pose as a needy aristocrat and embittered, it may be, by
  his material and intellectual dependence on the trader Engels. His own
  attempts to apply his theories by conspiracy and political action were inept
  and futile. He died in London a disappointed and resentful man, quite unaware
  of the posthumous fame that awaited his doctrines. It was the organization of
  his followers into the disciplined Communist Party and the modernization of
  his doctrines by the genius of Lenin that made his name a cardinal one in
  history.</p>

  <p>It is interesting to consider his general propositions now in the light of
  accomplished events and note the hits and misses of those heroic
  speculations&mdash; heroic, that is to say, measured by the mental courage of
  the time.</p>

  <p>Nowadays every schoolboy knows that the essential and permanent conflict
  in life is a conflict between the past and the future, between the
  accomplished past and the forward effort. He is made to realize this conflict
  in his primary biological course. Therein he comes to see and in part to
  understand the continual automatic struggle of the thing achieved, to hold
  the new, the new-born individual, the new-born idea, the widening needs of
  the species, in thrall. This conflict he is shown runs through all history.
  In the old classical mythology Saturn, the Conservative head-god, devoured
  all his children until at last one escaped to become Jove. And of how Jove
  bound Prometheus in his turn every lover of Shelley can tell. We need only
  refer the student to the recorded struggles in the histories of Republican
  Rome and Judaea between debtor and creditor; to the plebeian Secessions of
  the former and the year of Jubilee of the latter; to the legend of Joseph in
  Egypt (so richly interpreted now through the minute study of contemporary
  Egyptian documents by the students of the Breasted Commemoration Fund); to
  the English Statute of Mortmain; to Austen Livewright's lucid study of
  Bankruptcy Through the Ages (1979), to remind him of this perennial struggle
  of life against the creditor and the dead hand. But Marx, like most of his
  contemporaries, was profoundly ignorant of historical science, and addicted
  to a queer "dialectic" devised by the pseudo-philosopher Hegel; his
  ill-equipped mind apprehended this perennial antagonism only in terms of the
  finance of the industrial production about him; the entrepreneur, the
  capitalist, became the villain of his piece, using the prior advantage of his
  capital to appropriate the "surplus value" of production, so that his share
  of purchasing power became more and more disproportionately great.</p>

  <p>Marx seems never to have distinguished clearly between restrictive and
  productive possessions, which nowadays we recognize as a difference of
  fundamental importance. Exploitation for profit and strangulation for
  dominance, the radical son and the conservative father, were all one to him.
  And his proposals for expropriating the profit-seeking "Capitalist" were of
  the vaguest; he betrayed no conception whatever of the real psychology of
  economic activities, and he had no sense of the intricate organization of
  motives needed if the coarse incentive of profit was to be superseded.
  Indeed, he had no practical capacity at all, and one is not surprised to
  learn that for his own part he never earned a living. He claimed all the
  privileges of a prophet and all the laxity and indolence of a genius, and he
  never even completed his great book.</p>

  <p>It was the far abler and finer-minded Lenin (1870-1924, in power in Russia
  after 1917), rather than Marx, who gave a practical organization to the
  revolutionary forces of Communism and made the Communist Party for a time,
  until Stalin overtook it, the most vital creative force in the world. The
  essential intellectual difference between these two men is explained very
  clearly by Max Eastman (1895-1980), whose compact and scholarly Marx and
  Lenin is still quite readable by the contemporary student. In his time Lenin
  had to pose as the disciple and exponent of Marx; it was only later that
  criticism revealed the subtle brilliance of his effort to wrest a practical
  commonsense out of the time-worn doctrines of the older prophet.</p>

  <p>Another nineteenth-century writer, with perhaps a clearer realization of
  the strangulating effect of restrictive property as distinguished from the
  stimulating effect of exploitation, was Henry George (1839-1897), an American
  printer who rose to great popularity as a writer upon economic questions. He
  saw the life of mankind limited and dwarfed by the continual rise in rents.
  His naïve remedy was to tax the landowner, as Marx's naïve remedy was to
  expropriate the capitalist, and just as Marx never gave his disciples the
  ghost of an idea for a competent administration of the expropriated economic
  plant and resources of the world, so Henry George never indicated how, in the
  world of implacable individualism he advocated, the taxing authority was to
  find a use for its ever-increasing tax receipts.</p>

  <p>We can smile to-day at the limitations of these early pioneers. But we
  smile only because we live later than they did, and are two centuries and
  more to the good in our experience. We owe them enormous gratitude for the
  valiant disinterestedness of their life work.</p>

  <p>Our debt is on the whole rather for what they got rid of than for what
  they did. The broad outlines of the world's economic life are fairly simple
  as we see them frankly exposed to-day, but these men were born into an
  atmosphere of uncriticized usage, secrecy, time-honoured misconceptions,
  fetishisms, working fictions&mdash;which often worked very badly&mdash;and
  almost insane suppressions of thought and statement. The very terms they were
  obliged to use were question-begging terms; the habitual assumptions of the
  world they addressed were crooked and only to be apprehended with obliquity
  and inconsistency. They were forcing their minds towards the expression of
  reality through an intricate mental and moral tangle. They destroyed the
  current assumption of permanence in established institutions and usages, and
  though that seems a small thing to us now, it was a profoundly important
  release at the time. The infantile habit of assuming the fixity of the Thing
  that Is was almost universal in their day.</p>

  <p>The Marxist doctrines did at least indicate that a term was necessarily
  set to economic development through profit-seeking, by the concentration of
  controlling ownership, by the progressive relative impoverishment of larger
  and larger sections of the world population and by the consequent final
  dwindling of markets. The rapid coagulation of human activities after 1928
  C.E. was widely recognized as a confirmation of the Marxian forecast, and by
  one of those rapid mental leaps characteristic of the time, as a complete
  endorsement of the Communist pretension to have solved the social
  problem.</p>

  <p>Unembarrassed as we are now by the mental clutter of our forefathers, the
  fundamental processes at work during the distressful years of the third and
  fourth decade of the century appear fairly simple. We know that it is a
  permanent condition of human well-being that the general level of prices
  should never fall, and we have in the Currency Council a fairly efficient and
  steadily improving world-organ to ensure that end. A dollar, as we know it
  to-day, means practically the same thing in goods, necessities and
  satisfactions from one year's end to another. Its diminution in value is
  infinitesimal. No increase is ever allowed to occur. For the owner of an
  unspent dollar there is neither un-earnt increment nor unmerited loss. As the
  productive energy of our species rises, the dollar value of the total wealth
  is arranged to increase steadily in proportion, and neither is the creditor
  enriched nor robbed of his substantial expectation nor the debtor confronted
  with payments beyond his powers.</p>

  <p>There remains no way now of becoming passively wealthy. Gambling was
  ruthlessly eradicated under the Air Dictatorship and has never returned.
  Usury ranks with forgery as a monetary offence. Money is given to people to
  get what they want and not as a basis for further acquisition, and we realize
  that the gambling spirit is a problem for the educationist and mental expert.
  It implies a fundamental misunderstanding of life. We have neither
  speculators, shareholders, private usurers or rent lords. All these
  "independent" types have vanished from the earth. Land and its natural
  resources are now owned and administered either directly or by delegation, by
  a hierarchy of administrative boards representing our whole species; there
  are lease-holding cultivators and exploiting corporations with no right to
  sublet, but there is no such thing as a permanent private ownership of
  natural resources making an automatic profit by the increment of rent. And
  since there is, and probably always will be now, a continual advance in our
  average individual productive efficiency by which the whole community
  profits, there follows a continual extension of our collective enterprises, a
  progressive release of leisure and a secular raising of the standard of
  individual life, to compensate for what would otherwise be a progressive
  diminution in the number of brains and hands needed to carry on the work of
  the world. Human society, so long as productive efficiency increases, is
  OBLIGED to raise its standards of consumption and extend its activities year
  by year, or collapse. And if its advance does not go on it will drop into
  routine, boredom, viciousness and decay. Steadfastly the quantity and variety
  of things MUST increase.</p>

  <p>These imperative conditions, which constitute the A B C of the existing
  order, seem so obvious to-day, that it is with difficulty we put ourselves in
  the place of these twentieth century folk to whom they were strange and
  novel. They were not yet humanized en masse; they still had the mentality of
  the "struggle for existence". It is only by a considerable mental effort, and
  after a careful study of the gradual evolution of the civilized mentality out
  of the chaotic impulses and competition of an originally very unsocial
  animal, that we can even begin to see matters with the eyes of our
  predecessors of a century and a half ago.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap1_05"
     name="chap1_05">5. &mdash; THE WAY IN WHICH COMPETITION AND MONETARY<br>
  INEFFICIENCY STRAINED THE OLD ORDER</a></h2>

  <p class="first">In the twentieth century of the Christian era there was
  still no common currency by which to measure and carry on the world's
  economic exchanges. Those transactions were not merely apprehended inexactly
  because of this; they were falsified, and it did not seem possible that there
  would ever be an effective simplification. It is true that during what is
  known as the First Period of General Prosperity, from 1850 C.E. until 1914,
  there was a kind of working world system of currency and credit, centring
  upon the City of London and based on the gold pound; but this was a purely
  accidental growth, made workable by successive gold discoveries which
  prevented too disastrous a fall in prices as productive efficiency increased,
  and by the circumstances that gave the insular English a lead in the
  development of steam transport on land and sea and real incentives towards a
  practical propaganda of world free trade.</p>

  <p>That first gleam of cosmopolitan sunlight waned as it had waxed, without
  any contemporary apprehension of the real forces at work, much less any
  attempt to seize upon them and organize them in permanence. The financial
  ascendency and initiative of the City of London crumbled away after the war
  and nothing appeared to take its place. In any case, this quasi-cosmopolitan
  system based on the gold sovereign, and owing its modicum of success to
  continual increments in the available gold, would have wilted as the world's
  gold supplies gave out, but the strangulation of the world's industry after
  the war was greatly accelerated by the gold hoarding of the Americans and
  French.</p>

  <p>And during all that phase of opportunity there was no substantial effort
  to take hold of the land, sea and natural resources of the planet and bring
  them from a state of fragmentary, chaotic and wasteful exploitation into a
  general scheme. There remained sixty-odd "sovereign" governments, each
  claiming a supreme control of all the natural wealth of the areas within its
  frontiers, and under these governments, under conditions that varied with
  each, there were private corporations and individuals with a right to deal
  more or less freely with the fragment upon which they had established a grip.
  Everywhere the guiding principle in the exploitation of the minerals,
  sunshine and power resources of the globe was the profit of single or
  associated private individuals, and the patchwork governments of the time
  interfered in the profit scramble only in favour of their nationals against
  their foreign rivals. Yet for nearly a hundred years, because of the
  fortunate influx of gold and inventions, this profit-seeking system, linked
  to the metallic monetary system, sufficed to sustain a very great expansion
  and enlargement of human life, and it was hard to convince the mass of men,
  and still harder to convince the prosperous manufacturers, traders, miners,
  cultivators and financiers who dominated public affairs, that this was not a
  permanent system and that the world already needed very essential
  modifications of its economic methods. A considerable measure of breakdown, a
  phase of display, fear and distress, was necessary before they could be
  disillusioned.</p>

  <p>The nineteenth century had for its watchwords "individual enterprise and
  free competition". But the natural end of all competition is the triumph of
  one competitor. It was in America that the phenomena of Big Business first
  appeared and demonstrated the force of this truism; at a score of points
  triumphant organizations capable of crushing out new competitors and
  crippling and restraining new initiatives that threatened their predominance
  appeared. In Europe there was little governmental resistance to industrial
  alliances and concentrations in restraint of competition, and they speedily
  developed upon a scale that transcended political frontiers, but in the
  United States of America there was a genuine effort to prevent enterprises
  developing on a monopolistic scale. The conspicuous leader of this preventive
  effort was the first President Roosevelt (1858-1919) and its chief fruit the
  Sherman Anti-Trust Act (1890), which proved a rich mine for lawyers in the
  subsequent decades.</p>

  <p>These great consolidations, which closed the phase of free competition,
  were so far effective in controlling trade and arresting new developments
  that Hilary Hooker, in his Studies in Business Coagulation During the First
  Period of General Prosperity, is able to cite rather more than two thousand
  instances, ranging from radium and new fruits and foodstuffs to gramophones,
  automobiles, reconstructed households, artificial moonlight for the roadways
  by the countryside, and comfortable and economical railway plant, in which
  ample supplies or beneficial improvements were successfully kept off the
  market in the interests of established profit-making systems. After 1900 C.E.
  again there was a world-wide cessation of daily newspaper initiative and a
  consequent systole of free speech. Distribution, paper supply and news
  services had fallen into the hands of powerful groups able and willing to
  crush out any new types of periodical, or any inimical schools of public
  suggestion. They set about stereotyping the public mind.</p>

  <p>These same profit-making systems in possession also played a large part in
  arresting competition from countries in which they were less completely in
  control, by subsidized political action for the maintenance of protective
  tariffs. Long before the world break-down became manifest, the experience of
  the ordinary consumer so far belied the sanguine theory that free competition
  was a mode of endless progress, that he was still living in a house, wearing
  clothes, using appliances, travelling about in conveyances, and being fed
  with phrases and ideas that by the standard of the known and worked-out
  inventions of the time should have been discarded on an average, Hooker
  computes, from a quarter to half a century before. There was labour
  unemployed and abundant material available to remedy all this, but its
  utilization was held up by the rent-exacting and profit-earning systems
  already in possession.</p>

  <p>This lag in modernization added greatly to the effects of increased
  productive efficiency in the disengagement of those vast masses of destitute
  unemployed and unemploying people which began to appear almost everywhere,
  like the morbid secretion of a diseased body, as the twentieth century passed
  on into its third decade.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap1_06"
     name="chap1_06">6. &mdash; THE PARADOX OF OVER-PRODUCTION<br>
  AND ITS RELATION TO WAR</a></h2>

  <p class="first">This so-called "paradox of over-production" which figures so
  largely in the loose discussions of the "post-war" period was in its essence
  a very simple affair indeed. Just as the inevitable end of a process of free
  competition was a consolidation of successful competitors and an arrest of
  enterprise, so the inevitable end of a search for profit in production was a
  steady reduction of costs through increased efficiency&mdash;that is to say,
  a steady decrease of the ratio of employment to output. These things lie so
  much on the surface of the process that it is almost incredible to us that,
  wilfully or not, our ancestors disregarded them. Equally inevitable was it
  that these necessary contractions of enterprise and employment should lead to
  an increase in the proportion of unemployable people. Geographical expansion
  and a rising standard of life among both the employed and possessing classes,
  together with the stimulating effect of a steady influx of gold, masked and
  tempered for half a century this squeezing-out of an increasing fraction of
  the species from its general economic life. There were nevertheless
  fluctuations, "cycles of trade" as they were called, when the clogging
  machinery threatened to stall and was then relieved and went on again. But by
  the opening of the twentieth century, the fact that the method of running
  human affairs as an open competition for profit, was in its nature a
  terminating method, was forcing itself upon the attention even of those who
  profited most by it and had the most excuse for disregarding it, and who, as
  a class, knew nothing of the Marxian analysis.</p>

  <p>We know now that the primary task of world administration is to arrest
  this squeezing out of human beings from active economic life, by the
  continual extension of new collective enterprises, but such ideas had still
  to be broached at that time. The common folk, wiser in their instincts than
  the political economists in their intellectualism, were disposed to approve
  of waste and extravagance because money was "circulated" and workers "found
  employment". And the reader will not be able to understand the world-wide
  tolerance of growing armaments and war preparations during this period unless
  he realizes the immediate need inherent in the system for unremunerative
  public expenditure. Somewhere the energy economized had to come out. The
  world of private finance would not tolerate great rehousing, great
  educational and socially constructive enterprises, on the part of the
  relatively feeble governments of the time. All that had to be reserved for
  the profit accumulator. And so the ever-increasing productivity of the race
  found its vent in its ancient traditions of warfare, which admitted the
  withdrawal of a large proportion of the male population from employment for a
  year or so and secreted that vast accumulation of forts, battleships, guns,
  submarines, explosives, barracks and the like, which still amazes us. Without
  this cancer growth of armies and navies, the paradox of over-production
  latent in competitive private enterprise would probably have revealed itself
  in an overwhelming mass of unemployment before even the end of the nineteenth
  century. A social revolution might have occurred then.</p>

  <p>Militarism, however, alleviated these revolutionary stresses, by providing
  vast profit-yielding channels of waste. And it also strengthened the forces
  of social repression. The means of destruction accumulated on a scale that
  well-nigh kept pace with the increase in the potential wealth of mankind. The
  progressive enslavement of the race to military tyranny was an inseparable
  aspect, therefore, of free competition for profits. The latter system
  conditioned and produced the former. It needed the former so as to have
  ballast to throw out to destruction and death whenever it began to sink. The
  militarist phase of the early twentieth century and the paradox of
  over-production are correlated facets of the same reality, the reality of the
  planless hypertrophy of the social body.</p>

  <p>It is interesting to note how this morbid accumulation of energy in
  belligerence and its failure to find vent in other directions became more and
  more evident in the physiognomy of the world as the twentieth century
  progressed. The gatherings of mankind became blotched with uniforms. Those
  admirable albums of coloured pictures, Historical Scenes in a Hundred
  Volumes, which are now placed in all our schools and show-places and supplied
  freely to any home in which there are children, display very interestingly
  the advent, predominance and disappearance of military preoccupations in the
  everyday life of our ancestors. These pictures are all either reproductions
  of actual paintings, engravings or photographs, or, in the case of the
  earlier volumes, they are elaborate reconditionings to the more realistic
  methods of our time of such illustrations as were available. Military
  operations have always attracted the picture-maker at all times, and there
  are plentiful pictures of battles from every age, from the little
  cricket-field battle of the Middle Ages to the hundred mile fights of the
  last Great War, but our interest here is not with battles but with the
  general facies of social life. Even in the war-torn seventeenth century the
  general stream of life went on without any manifest soldiering. War was a
  special occupation. While the battles of the English Civil War, which set up
  the first English Republic (1649-1660), were in progress, we have evidence
  that hunting and hawking parties were busy almost within sound of the guns.
  The novels of Jane Austen (England, 1775-1817) pursue their even way without
  the faintest echo of the land and sea campaigns in progress. Goethe in Weimar
  (the German literary "Great Man" during the "Great Man" period of literary
  thought in Europe, 1749-1832) could not be bothered by requests for supplies
  of wood and food for the German troops before the battle of Jena, and was
  very pleased to meet his "enemy alien" Napoleon socially during that
  campaign.</p>

  <p>We rarely see the monarchs of the eighteenth century depicted in military
  guise; the fashion was for robes and majesty rather than for the spurs and
  feathers of the Bantam warrior-king. It was the unprecedented vehemence of
  the Napoleonic adventure that splashed the social life of Europe with
  uniforms, infected feminine fashions, and even set plump princess colonels,
  frogged with gold lace and clutching bare sabres, joggling unsteadily at the
  heads of regiments. There was a brief return towards civilian attire with the
  accession of the "domesticated monarchs", Louis Philippe in France and
  Victoria in Great Britain; they marked a transient reaction from Napoleonic
  fashions; but from the middle of the nineteenth century onward the prestige
  of the soldier resumed its advance and the military uniform became
  increasingly pervasive. Flags became more abundant in the towns and
  "flag-days" dotted the calendar. There was never a crowd pictured in Europe
  after 1870 without a soldier or so.</p>

  <p>The Great War greatly intensified the military element in the street
  population, not only in Europe but America. Various corps of feminine
  auxiliaries were enrolled during that time and paraded the world thereafter
  in appetising soldierly outfits. In the United States, except at Washington,
  or when there was a parade of civil war veterans, a soldier in uniform had
  been hitherto the rarest of birds. He would have felt strange and
  uncomfortable. He would have offended the susceptibilities of a consciously
  liberated people. The Great War changed all that. When Germany was disarmed
  after the war, a Nazi movement and a Reichsbanner movement supplied the
  needed colour until a German's freedom to get into properly recognized livery
  was restored. The pattern of half-military, half-civilian organizations in
  uniform had already been spread about the world between the South African War
  (1899-1901) and the Great War, by the Boy Scout movement.</p>

  <p>Of the Nazi movement, the Italian Fascisti and the Polish Brotherhood at
  least there will be more to tell later. The black and brown shirts may be
  cited here as instances of the visible breaking-down of the boundaries
  between military and civil life that went on during and after the World
  War.</p>

  <p>Hitherto war had been a marginal business, fought upon "fronts", and the
  ordinary citizen had lived in comparative security behind the front, but the
  bombing, gas-diffusing aeroplane, and later the long-range air torpedo,
  changed all that. The extended use of propaganda as a weapon, and the
  increasing danger of social mutiny under war stress, had also its share in
  making the entire surface of a belligerent country a war area and abolishing
  any vestiges of civil liberty, first during actual warfare and then in view
  of warfare. The desirability of getting everyone under orders, under oath,
  and subject to prompt disciplinary measures, became more and more manifest to
  governments.</p>

  <p>So within a century the appearance of the human crowd changed over from a
  varied assembly of incoordinated free individuals to a medley of uniforms.
  Everybody's dress at last indicated function, obligation and preparedness.
  The militarization of the European multitude reached a maximum during the
  Polish wars. About 1942 gas masks, either actually worn or hanging from the
  neck, were common for a time, and so, too, were the small sheath-knives which
  were to be used in disposing of fallen aviators who might still be alive.
  Patella metal hats and metal epaulettes to protect the head and body against
  a rain of poisoned needles also appeared. Some civilians became far more
  formidable-looking than any soldiers.</p>

  <p>The military authorities of those days were much perplexed by the problem
  of giving the general population protective apparatus and light weapons that
  would be effective against the military enemy and yet useless for the
  purposes of insurrection. For in spite of the most strenuous suppression of
  agitation in those troubled decades, the possible revolt of humanity against
  warfare, the possibility of complete "loss of morale", however illogical and
  incoherent, was felt by the professional soldiers as an increasing
  menace.</p>

  <p>Along the streets of most of the old-world cities there presently appeared
  the characteristic yellow (or in France blue, and in America red-and-
  white-striped) air-raid pillars with their glass faces, only to be broken
  into and used after an official alarm, which contained respirators and
  first-aid sets for possible gas victims. It is also to the same period we
  have to ascribe the multiplication of vivid and abundant direction signs at
  every street corner, set so as to throw a minimum of light upward and
  pointing the way to gas chambers and hospitals. It was a "gas-minded" world
  in the 'forties. The practical suppression of other vivid and illuminated
  street signs was a natural corollary to this preoccupation.</p>

  <p>In the first half of the twentieth century the cities blazed with
  advertisement. It was the period of maximum advertisement. The pictures of
  the Great White Way of New York, Piccadilly Circus, the Grands Boulevards of
  Paris and so forth, with their polychromatic visual clamour, still strike us
  as distractingly picturesque. There was much flood-lighting after 1928. Then
  progressively the lights were turned down again and that visual clamour died
  away. As the air threat returned, "lights out" became at last imperative,
  except for the vivid furtive indications of refuge and first aid we have just
  mentioned.</p>

  <p>War fear spread very rapidly after 1930. Darkness recaptured the nocturnal
  town. "Night-life" became stealthy and obscure, with an increasing taint of
  criminality. All civil hospitals and all private doctors had disappeared from
  the world by 1945 and the health services were only legally demilitarized
  again after 2010. The amalgamation of the military and civil hospital and
  medical services began in France as early as 1933. By 1945 every doctor in
  the Old World was, in theory at least, on a quasi-military footing; he wore a
  distinctive uniform, was subject to stringent discipline, and his premises,
  as well as the hospitals, bore the characteristic black-and-yellow
  chequerwork. All nurses were similarly enrolled. Finally the general public
  was enrolled for health treatment as common patients under oath. By 1948 in
  such towns as had sufficiently survived the general social demoralization to
  enforce such regulations, it was impossible to take a chill or break an ankle
  without at once falling into the category of patients and being numbered, put
  into a black-and-yellow uniform and marched or carried off for treatment.
  Theoretically this system of treatment was universal. In practice neither the
  uniforms nor the doctors were available. For regulation and militarization
  were going on in that period against an immense counter-drive towards social
  disintegration. The more humanity got into uniform, the shabbier the uniforms
  became.</p>

  <p>Before the Polish struggle, general architecture was very little affected
  by military needs. The militarization of costume preceded the militarization
  of scenery. Even barracks and such-like army buildings were erected by army
  architects as a simple vulgarization of ordinary housing patterns, a mere
  stiffening up, so to speak, of the common "jerry-built" house. There still
  survive for our astonishment pictures of Victorian Military Gothic and
  Victorian Military Tudor, produced under the British War Office. They display
  homes fit for drill-sergeants. The military mind had to be roused by the
  experiences of the Polish conflict to the profound reconstruction of the
  ordinary town that had become necessary if it was still to be taken
  seriously. Before then, fortification scarcely affected the urban scene at
  all, even in the case of a fortified town. Previously a fortress had been
  just an ordinary civil town surrounded at distances of from three to fifty
  miles by forts, strong points, trench systems and the like. Now it was
  realized, first in Berlin, and then in Danzig, Warsaw, Paris and Turin, and
  after that by the whole world, that air warfare demanded not merely
  fortification round a town, but much more imperatively, fortification OVER a
  town. The world, which had been far too stupid to realize in 1930 that the
  direct way out of its economic difficulties lay in the modernization and
  rebuilding of its houses, set itself, in a state of war panic after 1942, to
  as complete a revision of its architecture in the face of bombs and gas as
  its deepening impoverishment permitted. What it would not do for prosperity,
  it attempted belatedly out of fear.</p>

  <p>The first most obvious undertaking was the construction of those immense
  usually ill-built concrete cavern systems for refuge, whose vestiges are
  still to be visited by the curious tourist at Paris and Berlin (the London
  ones have all fallen in, the collapse beginning after the great landslip and
  fire), and close upon this came the cessation of tall building and the
  concentration of design upon the vast (and often dangerous) carapace roof and
  its gigantic supporting pillars and foundation rafts. Only the ever-deepening
  poverty, the increasing industrial disorganization and the transitoriness of
  that last war-phase saved all the towns in the world from being thrust
  completely under such squat massive coverings.</p>

  <p>So strong were the influences of that time that even up to 2020 the
  tendency of architectural design was to crouch. Hardly any mass of buildings
  erected between 1945 and the end of the century lifts up its head and looks
  the world in the face. That period has been called, not unjustly, Second
  Egyptian. And this was so in spite of the multiplying opportunities for grace
  and lightness afforded by the supersession of steel frame buildings by the
  strong and flexible neo-concrete materials that were already available. How
  timidly they were used! We grovel no longer because we are ceasing to fear
  each other. The soaring, ever improving homes in which we live to-day would
  have sent our great-grandfathers scurrying to their cellars in an ecstasy of
  terror.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap1_07"
     name="chap1_07">7. &mdash; THE GREAT WAR OF 1914-1918</a></h2>

  <p class="first">There is a monstrous tedious accumulation of records
  concerned with the World War. The Catalogue of Historical Material stored at
  Atacama gives a list of 2,362,705 books and gross files, up to date, and of
  these over 182,000 deal exclusively or largely with the causation of the war.
  Nothing could bring home to the student the profound difference in mental
  equipment between ourselves and the men and women of that period than a visit
  to the long silent galleries of that great library of dead disputes and
  almost completely forgotten records. He will see hardly a visitor along the
  vistas of that shining framework of shelves; a quiet cleaner or duster
  perhaps will be visible, scrutinizing the condition of the material, or a
  young revisionist student patiently checking some current summary&mdash;or a
  black cat. For the rest, above, below, to right and left is a clean and
  luminous stillness; papers at rest.</p>

  <p>In one large section of this sere honeycomb the student will find the
  records of the "war guilt controversy" that agitated the world for decades
  after the Peace of Versailles. Let him draw out a seat anywhere and take down
  a file or so at hazard and turn over its pages. He will be able to read
  almost all of it nowadays, whatever the original language, because
  practically all the collection has now been interleaved with translations
  into Basic English. And it will seem to him that he is reading the
  outpourings of lunatics, so completely have the universal obsessions of that
  time been exorcized since.</p>

  <p>Had "Germany" planned the war? Was "France" the guilty party? Had
  "Britain" much to answer for? With difficulty will the student let down his
  mind into the fantastic world of extinct imaginations in which these strange
  personifications, as monstrous and incredible as the ancient gods of India,
  were treated as real and morally responsible individuals, hated, trusted,
  feared and loved. The war was, in immediate fact, an aimless and fruitless
  slaughter upon the altars of these stupendous deities, the wounding and
  mutilation of perhaps twenty million human beings, and a vast burning-up of
  material wealth. In the crazy fancy of our ancestors it was a noble and
  significant struggle. Happily we need not revive their craziness here. The
  question of "war guilt" was never settled. It ceased to be pursued, it was
  neglected, it floated away into the absurd, and little but those three
  hundred feet or so of forgotten books and gross files remain to testify to
  its vanished importance.</p>

  <p>The causation of the struggle was, indeed, perfectly simple. It arose
  naturally and necessarily from that irregular and disproportionate growth of
  human appliances as compared with the extension of political and social
  intelligence we have already described.</p>

  <p>The new means of communication and transport, and the new economic life
  which demanded the products of every zone and soil for its purposes, were
  necessitating the reorganization of human affairs as a World-State, and since
  the world was already parcelled up among sixty-odd competing sovereign
  governments there were only two possible courses open to mankind, either to
  arrange the coalescence of these governments by treaty and rational
  arrangements to meet the new need, or to allow a steadily intensified mutual
  pressure to develop into more or less thinly disguised attempts at world
  conquest. In the decades before the war the British, French, German, Russian,
  Japanese and American systems were all, as the word went then,
  "imperialist"&mdash; all, that is, attempting to become World-States on a
  planet on which obviously there was room only for one single World-State.
  Nothing of the sort had been apparent when the methods of European
  statescraft had been devised. These vaster possibilities had yawned open
  afterwards. The eighteenth and nineteenth centuries were centuries of small
  restricted wars for limited advantages. In the twentieth century the scale of
  war expanded beyond any limit and the advantages to be won by it disappeared.
  But the politicians and diplomatists played their time-honoured game against
  each other with a sort of terrified inevitability. They were driven; they had
  no control, or at least none of them seemed to have had the vigour and
  imagination to attempt a control. They were driven by the economic necessity
  we have explained in the previous section. They had to arm preposterously.
  They had to threaten. They had to go through with the business.</p>

  <p>These forces account for the outbreak and universality of the Great War,
  but they do not account for its peculiar frightfulness. For that it is
  necessary to realize that though governments expanded only against an
  enormous pressure of mutual restraint, no limitations had been set to the
  hypertrophy of financial and industrial enterprises. These last were under
  the sway of a relentless and unrestrained progress; they expanded, invented,
  urged and sold; they brought weapons of a strange and terrible effectiveness
  to the settlement of what were in comparison small and antiquated disputes.
  To that hypertrophy of the armourer we will return presently, because the
  Great War was really only a first revelation of this particular disproportion
  between economics and politics, and the evil still went on in an exaggerated
  form after the formal conclusion of the struggle at the Peace of Versailles
  (1919). But let us first tell what needs to be known of the details of the
  Great War.</p>

  <p>How little that is now! There is a vast literature both of fiction based
  on experience and of personal reminiscence about it, and some of it is
  admirably written; almost any of it may be read for interest and edification
  and hardly any of it need be read with scholarly precision. The picture of
  the outbreak of the war still touches us. There was a curious unconsciousness
  of the grossness of the menace in events, even on the part of myriads doomed
  to suffer and die in a few months' time. Many of the stories told begin with
  a holiday party or a country-house gathering or some such bright setting. The
  weather that August (1914) was exceptionally fine.</p>

  <p>The details of the struggle itself were as horrible and distressing as
  they were inconsequent, and there is no need whatever for anyone but the
  specialist to master their sequence in detail. The old-fashioned history,
  with its lists of names, dates, battles and so on, was designed rather to
  supply easily marked material for examinations than to give any sense of the
  historical process. Examinations have long passed out of educational
  practice; they have gone to join the "globes" and the abacus, the slate and
  the cane in the scholastic limbo, but their memory is preserved in the
  popular game of "examination papers", when people write down as fast as they
  can and as much as they can about some suddenly selected subject.</p>

  <p>Few of us could write even a brief account now of the World War. The names
  of such generals as Haig, Kitchener, French, Joffre, Foch and Ludendorff, to
  take names at random, and such battles as Tannenberg, the Marne, the Somme,
  Paschendaele, the Falkland Isles, Jutland and so forth, mean nothing and need
  mean nothing to the ordinary citizen to-day. He does not know whether French
  was really French or not, nor whether Foch was a Frenchman or a German. He
  inclines to the latter view. He does not know who won or lost these conflicts
  and he does not care. He has not even a sporting interest in it. They were
  not lively fights. Nearly all the commanders concerned had dull and
  unattractive personalities and the business was altogether too unwieldy for
  them. Most of their operations were densely stupid, muddled both in
  conception and execution. One would as soon listen to a child reciting not
  very accurately and at endless length the deals and tricks of some game of
  cards it has played, or imagines it has played, as read their
  memoirs&mdash;packed as they too often are with self-exculpation, personal
  resentments and malice. Faint, faded, immense and far-off tragedies, these
  struggles that were to have astounded posterity have already gone far towards
  complete effacement in any but a few specializing minds, are hardly more
  vivid now in our collective consciousness than the battles of the
  Peloponnesian War&mdash;or the campaigns and conquests of Tamerlane. They had
  nothing of the primary historical importance and strategic splendour which
  have restored the gigantic military conceptions of Genghis Khan to an
  integral place in our ordinary educational curriculum.</p>

  <p>For the rodomontade of the conflict the curious cannot do better than
  glance through the eager narrative of Winston Churchill's World Crisis. There
  one finds all the stereotyped flourishes and heroisms of nineteenth-century
  history from the British point of view; the "drama of history" in rich
  profusion, centred upon one of the most alert personalities in the conflict.
  He displays a vigorous naïve puerility that still gives his story an atoning
  charm. He has the insensitiveness of a child of thirteen. His soldiers are
  toy soldiers and he loves to knock over a whole row of them. He enjoyed the
  war. He takes himself and all the now forgotten generals and statesmen of the
  war with a boyish seriousness. He passes grave judgments on their tragic
  fooleries and distributes compliments and blame, often in the most gracious
  manner, convinced that he is writing for a meticulously admiring and envious
  posterity. They would read, they would marvel. He was the sort of man who
  believed that when he begot children he created an audience. He was misled by
  the excitement of his own reading of history. He not only measures for us the
  enormous gulf between the mentality of his times and our own, but he enables
  us to bridge that gulf with an amused and forgiving sympathy.</p>

  <p>A less attractive spirit displays itself in the memoirs of such figures as
  Ludendorff, Bülow, Clemenceau, Fisher, Foch, and so through the whole
  category of war leaders. The war was the supreme event in the lives of most
  of these men and apparently they were never able to think of anything else
  afterwards. They had none of the recuperative innocence of Churchill, his
  terrier-like interest in everything. They all took to writing furiously in
  their declining years and no other pens could have damned them so completely.
  They are grown-up and yet under-developed persons; as adult as old
  chimpanzees; they cannot claim Churchill's benefit of schoolboy, and there is
  a real horror in their wrinkled meannesses and envies, their gross
  enthusiasms and their sincere bloodthirstiness and hate. Most of their mutual
  recriminations are too incomprehensible to be of the slightest interest now;
  spite and twaddle are still spite and twaddle even if drenched with blood.
  The most accessible sample for the contemporary reader is The Life and
  Diaries of Field-Marshal Sir Henry Wilson, Bart., G.C.B., D.S.O., a lean,
  unsightly man of infinite energy, gusto and vanity, who played a very
  prominent rôle in bringing about and carrying out the catastrophe. It is the
  latest reprint in the Historical Documents Series; it is richly illustrated
  and abundantly annotated, and with it are bound up the brilliantly scornful
  criticisms of Wilson's contemporary, Sir Andrew Macphail, and Stephen
  Freudheim's more scientific analysis of him as the supreme type of the
  "soldierly mind".</p>

  <p>For the grimmer actualities of the struggle there is a vast and sombre
  literature. It has been summarized in the last fifteen years by the
  Historical Bureau in its War Pictures for Posterity by Pen, Pencil and
  Camera. Everyone should turn over those strange incredible records of
  endurance, callousness, devotion and insane courage, to learn something of
  the extremes to which men and women like ourselves can be pushed by the grim
  forces of social compulsion.</p>

  <p>The earlier volumes deal chiefly with the psychology of the more than half
  civilized citizens of the Atlantic and North European states suddenly
  precipitated into a maelstrom of destruction. We see the urban crowds
  demonstrating and cheering in the streets of the capital cities, the floods
  of youths coming from their work to "join up", the wonder and unimaginative
  fierceness and heroism of the opening stage. Then come the first contacts,
  villages in flames, the wild shooting of curious bystanders as spies and
  guerillas, realizations of horror and a wave of fear, the invaded populations
  in flight, black crowds with their pitiful impedimenta streaming along
  darkling roads, going they know not whither. The rifles and machine-guns
  rattle, the guns thud, and the cheering adventurousness of the advancing
  armies as they blunder heavily into contact passes into a phase of astounded
  violence and hardship. The new war was like no war that had ever been before.
  The French upon their eastern front went forward to the attack with immense
  élan, in bright uniforms and to the historical inspiration of the
  "Marseillaise". They were massacred. They lost a third of a million men in
  three weeks. The Germans poured through Belgium, more than a million strong,
  to be stopped and stunned with Paris almost within their grasp. The pictures
  show the smiling landscape of eastern Belgium, France and east Prussia in
  July 1914, and the same countryside a couple of months later&mdash;torn,
  scored and trenched, defiled with bloody heaps of litter that were once
  clothed bodies, an anguish of countless thousands of unclean, hungry,
  exhausted, cruelty-wrung human beings.</p>

  <p>These bands of contact, these regions of filthy pain and tumult, spread.
  Presently there were "war zones" reaching from the North Sea to the Alps and
  across Eastern Europe, strange regions in which every house was a ruin, every
  tree a splintered trunk, where millions of crouching men went to and fro in
  trenches and ditches furtively like rats, and the ragged dead lay unburied.
  There day and night the superfluous energy of a profiteering economic system,
  denied all other outlet by its own preconceptions and the rigid historical
  traditions in which it was blinkered, blew itself away in the incessant
  concussions of mines, bombs and guns and a continued destruction of human
  life.</p>

  <p>Presently newly invented weapons, hitherto untried, came to extend and
  intensify the struggle. The aeroplane, and that primitive "navigable" the
  Zeppelin, carried the war behind the fronts and attacked the civilian
  population in the cities. We see the explosive and incendiary bombs bursting
  into the dirty little urban homes of the time, blowing to rags the bed-rid
  grandmother and the baby in the cradle; we see the panic-stricken crowds
  seeking the shelter of cellars and excavations and the drainlike railway
  "tubes" of the time. In the early stages of the air-war only explosives and
  inflammatory substances were used, but as the struggle progressed the art of
  using gas bombs developed, and an agonizing suffocation was added to the
  nocturnal chances of flame and explosion and death among fallen ruins for the
  non-combatant at home. The submarine, also, was a novelty of the Great War,
  and a very searching novelty. It was used first to sink fighting ships and
  then it was turned against all sea-going craft. We have vivid descriptions of
  the sinking of the Lusitania without warning and the drowning of 1,198 men,
  women and children. She was, by the standards of the time, a great and
  luxurious ship, and a sort of symbolism was found by the writers of this
  period in this sudden descent from light, comfort and confidence into a
  desperate and hopeless struggle in the waters of the night. All the
  achievements of nineteenth-century civilization seemed to many to be
  following in the downward wake of the Lusitania.</p>

  <p>Service in these early submarines strained men to the breaking point. They
  were essentially engines of war, they had all the defects of inventions at an
  early stage, and none of the security and comfort of the great submarine
  barges that are used to-day for the Mediterranean and Atlantic Ridge mines
  and for general deep sea exploration. These, with their beautifully adjusted
  pressure systems and their limitless vertical range, are calculated rather to
  mislead than enlighten us as to the capabilities of the primitive submarines
  of the Great War. The latter were able to descend safely only to a depth of a
  hundred metres; below that the pressure became too much for them and their
  plates gave and leaked. When they leaked the salt water was apt to affect the
  accumulators and chlorine gas was released to torment and suffocate the
  crews. Below a hundred and fifty metres these fragile contrivances crumpled
  up altogether and were destroyed. The air in them became foul when they
  submerged, in spite of the compressed oxygen they carried, and the continual
  condensation of exhaled moisture gave them a peculiar clammy discomfort. They
  could move about under water for a couple of days by means of their electric
  batteries, but then it was necessary to come to the surface and run their oil
  combustion engines for some hours to recharge. Armed with guns and packed
  with mines, bombs, torpedoes and other explosives, they set out to harass and
  destroy the surface shipping of the enemy.</p>

  <p>It was a difficult and almost fantastically dangerous task. Submerged,
  they were invisible, but also they were blind. Near the surface they could
  get a limited view of what was going on by means of a periscope. On the
  surface they had the range of outlook of any other surface boat, but at all
  the risks a surface boat must take. So under conditions of extreme discomfort
  and partial asphyxiation the crews of these strangely formidable and
  strangely fragile contrivances groped their way towards their victims. To see
  the quarry fairly they had to come to the surface, and that exposed them to
  gunfire. If their thin steel skins were pierced by a single shot they could
  no longer go under. Often when submerged they betrayed their whereabouts
  unwittingly by bubbles of gas and escapes of oil.</p>

  <p>At first, in spite of their limitations, the submarines proved a very
  deadly weapon, more particularly in the hands of the Central European Powers.
  They destroyed a great multitude of ships and drowned many score thousands of
  men. Then slowly the methods used against them improved. They were hunted by
  a special flotilla, and among other ships by the "Q" boats, armed vessels
  disguised as harmless merchantmen. These lured them to the surface and then
  let down sham bulwarks and opened fire upon them, so that after a time they
  no longer dared emerge to challenge even the most harmless-looking craft.
  Explosive mines were moored in their possible tracks and mine-armed nets set
  across harbours and channels. They were also watched for by aeroplanes and
  special airships whose signals guided the destroyers to their quarry.
  Ingenious listening contrivances were invented to locate them. They were shot
  at on the surface, rammed, and pursued by "depth charges" which could strain
  their plates and disable them even when exploded scores of metres away.</p>

  <p>Such, briefly, were the conditions of submarine warfare in the years 1917-
  18. And yet to the very end of the war men could be found to carry it on, to
  destroy and drown and be in their turn hunted and destroyed. The building and
  launching of submersibles never ceased. Men went down in them to chilly
  confinement, to the perpetual anxiety of mine or ram, to the quivering menace
  of the distant depth charge, to the reasonable probability of a frightful
  death beyond all human aid. Few submarines returned to harbour ten times;
  many went out new upon their first voyage never to return. Two hundred of
  them were lost by the Germans alone; each loss a tragedy of anguish and
  dismay in the deeps. Towards the end it was claimed by their antagonists that
  the crews were losing morale. Once or twice an undamaged submarine that had
  been cornered surrendered, and the new commanders showed a growing tendency
  to return to port for minor repairs or other slight pretexts. But on the
  whole, such is the unimaginative heroic submissiveness of our species, the
  service was sustained. The Germans supplied most of the flesh for this
  particular altar; willing and disciplined, their youngsters saluted and
  carried their kit down the ladder into this gently swaying clumsy murder
  mechanism which was destined to become their coffin.</p>

  <p>Their obedience brings us to one of the most fundamental lessons that the
  Great War has for us: the extreme slowness with which the realization of even
  the most obvious new conditions pierces through the swathings of habitual
  acceptance. Millions of human beings went open-eyed to servitude, bullying,
  hardship, suffering and slaughter, without a murmur, with a sort of
  fatalistic pride. In obedience to the dictates of the blindest prejudices and
  the most fatuous loyalties they did their utmost to kill men against whom
  they had no conceivable grievance, and they were in their turn butchered
  gallantly, fighting to the last. The War Pictures volumes dismay our
  imaginations by portraying a series of wholesale butcheries, many of them on
  a stupendous scale, of men who died facing their enemies. After the great
  slaughter of the French at the outset of the war, and a mighty killing of
  Russians at the Battles of Tannenberg and the Masurian Lakes, there was
  during what was called the deadlock period, the period of trench warfare, a
  diminution of the losses upon the West. Hostilities sank down to a gusty
  conflict of shell-fire, rifle assassinations, and raids with bombs and
  bludgeons. In the East, however, the Russians ran out of ammunition, and held
  their trenches only by a great martyrdom of men; they lost well over a
  million before the end of 1914, and yet they continued to obey orders. A
  series of minor campaigns broke out in regions remote from the main centres
  of contact. There is a horrible account in the Pictures of the sufferings of
  some thousands of British common soldiers taken prisoners at Kut, in
  Mesopotamia. (Their generals and other officers, however, who had arranged
  that particular capitulation, were honourably and comfortably entertained by
  their captors the Turks.) There is no effective expression of resentment by
  the British troops on record.</p>

  <p>In 1916 and 1917 there were spasmodic renewals of hostilities on a large
  scale by the British and French in France. Newly trained British armies were
  made to advance in close formation by generals who, unless they were
  imbeciles, could have had no doubts of the fate to which they were sending
  their men. If they were not imbeciles then they were criminally unwilling to
  learn and soul-blind to suffering and waste. The mentality of these men is
  still a matter for discussion. The poor boys they commanded were marched
  forward shoulder to shoulder in successive waves of attack, and so advancing
  they were shot to pieces by the enemy machine-guns. Out of battalions of six
  or seven hundred, perhaps a hundred would struggle through the defensive fire
  and come to bomb-throwing, bayonet-thrusts and surrender in the German
  trenches. Small isolated groups of them in shell-holes and captured positions
  fought on for days. So perished the flower of an entire school generation,
  collected from hundreds of thousands of homes, more or less loved, more or
  less cared for and more or less educated; it had been enlisted, trained, sent
  out to the battlefields at enormous cost, to be left at last in the desolated
  spaces between the armies, lying in heaps and swathes to rot and be
  rat-eaten. For months afterwards, as the photographs show, thousands of them
  were to be seen sprawling in formation as they fell, just as if their ranks
  were still waiting to leap again to the attack. But as the observer drew
  nearer he realized their corruption. He discovered bony hands, eyeless
  sockets, faces far gone in decay.</p>

  <p>The British commander-in-chief in his despatches did not fail to extol the
  courage of his lost battalions and to represent this monstrous exploit as a
  victory. Some mile or so of ground had been gained in that July offensive and
  less than 12,000 prisoners had been taken. Twice as many British were left
  prisoners in German hands, but this the despatches ignored.</p>

  <p>The appalling nature of this particular disaster leaked out only very
  slowly. The British censorship at least was efficient and the generals,
  however incapable in other respects, lied magnificently. The Channel crossing
  made it particularly easy to hide events from the British public. And it had
  a peculiar effect on the British troops; it gave them a feeling of being in
  another and a different world from "home", a war-world in which such cruel
  and fantastic things could be natural. This monstrous massacre was, indeed,
  contrived and carried through, not simply without a revolt, but with scarcely
  an audible protest on the part of either the parents, relations, friends or
  surviving comrades of those hosts of wasted victims.</p>

  <p>The commanders of the Russian armies in Austria, Armenia and elsewhere
  were announcing equally costly and heroic triumphs and the Germans and
  Austrians were issuing the most valiant and excessive contradictions of their
  claims. They, too, were losing hideously enough, though in a lesser
  proportion than their opponents. The next year (1917), the British, gallant
  and docile as ever, with only very slightly improved tactics, were going
  again into great offensives.</p>

  <p>But now the French troops began to manifest a livelier intelligence. They
  were amidst familiar things, nearer their homes and less cut off from
  subversive influences than the British. A certain General Nivelle, at that
  time French Commander-in-Chief, made what Churchill calls an "experiment",
  which resulted altogether in the loss of nearly a couple of hundred thousand
  men. It involved the advance of masses of infantry into intense fields of
  fire. In an hour, said Lieutenant Ybarnegaray (in a debate in the French
  Chamber, June 1917), they were reduced to a crowd "running like madmen", all
  formations and distinctions lost. Provision had been made for less than
  15,000 wounded. There were seven times as many. Most of the casualties never
  received the most elementary attention for three days. The result was
  gangrene, amputation and death for thousands. Then came the first intimation
  that there were limits to human obedience. A French division ordered into
  action to continue this futile holocaust refused to march. Churchill says
  this was "deeply disquieting" to the authorities, and no doubt it pained and
  distressed every intelligent amateur of war. This particular division was
  cajoled into a change of mind. It took part in the fighting, says Churchill,
  "without discredit", but the spirit of its resistance spread.</p>

  <p>The next sign of sanity in this world torture was the collapse of the
  grotesque Russian autocracy. We have already told of the mental and moral
  decay of the Tzardom in our general study of the degeneration of monarchy.
  [Non inventus.&mdash;ED.] Abruptly this profoundly rotten government
  collapsed into nothing; its vast domains became a various disorder, and for
  some months phantom imitations of Western revolutionaries, inspired by
  memories of the first French revolution or by legends of British
  parliamentary wisdom, occupied the capital. The one certain fact in the
  situation was the accumulated disinclination of the Russian people for any
  further warfare. But this first republican government under an eloquent
  lawyer politician, of no great directive force, Alexandre Kerensky, was
  unable either to carry on the war or to end it. A subdued but spreading
  clamour for "peace by negotiation" in all the combatant countries ensued, a
  clamour that active repression and the most rigorous concealment in the Press
  failed to silence. There was an attempt to call a sort of peace conference of
  Radicals at Stockholm, and then a second revolution in Russia which carried a
  small and resolute Communist organization to power&mdash;carried it to power
  simply and solely because there was no other organized alternative, and
  because it promised peace plainly and surely&mdash;peace on any terms. The
  Russian armies melted away at its signal; the men streamed home. The German
  military authorities in the East found the trenches before them undefended,
  and with every courtesy of war, as one soldier to another, welcomed the
  Russian officers of the old régime, taking refuge from the belated resentment
  of their own men.</p>

  <p>In 1917 mankind seemed already to be awakening from the war-nightmare.
  Mutinies broke out in sixteen separate French army corps, 115 regiments were
  involved, divisions elected soldiers' councils and whole regiments set out
  for Paris to demand a reasonable wind-up of the struggle. The one last hope
  of the despairing soldiers, said Pierre Laval, had been Stockholm. That
  disappointment had made life unbearable. But the storm abated with the entry
  of the United States of America into the war, and the powers in control of
  the Western World were still able to pursue their dreadful obsessions for
  another year.</p>

  <p>War Pictures for Posterity by Pen, Pencil and Camera devotes a whole
  volume (xxi) to the tragedy of a special Russian infantry corps in France.
  Fifteen thousand Russians had been sent thither in 1916 to be equipped and
  armed and put into the line with the French armies. Many of these poor lads
  scarcely knew the difference between a Frenchman and a German, and the
  ostensible objects of the war were quite beyond their understanding. But they
  heard of the revolution in their own country and they resolved to consider
  their attitude with regard to it. They elected representatives and put it to
  the vote whether they should continue to fight, which meant for them to take
  part in that "experiment" of Nivelle's known to be in preparation at the
  time. They chose what seemed to them the generous part and went into the
  battle. The French command used them ruthlessly, and nearly 6,000 were killed
  or wounded. The rest came out of the line and mutinied. They would fight no
  more. Thereupon these defenceless men were surrounded by trustworthy French
  troops, a great concentration of guns was assembled, fire was opened upon
  them suddenly and they were massacred. Horrible photographs of the details of
  this&mdash;photographs hidden away at the time from the authorities and
  brought to light later&mdash;are given in the summary already cited.</p>

  <p>For nearly a year the French lost confidence in the morale of their own
  men and dared make no more great attacks, but their allies offered up another
  400,000 men in the battle of Paschendaele and accounted for 300,000 Germans,
  and in the spring the Germans made a vast multitudinous attack in the West
  which succeeded at first and then collapsed, whereupon their antagonists,
  reinforced by new armies from America, waded back through blood to a dreadful
  final victory. The last nine months of the conflict saw more slaughter than
  any preceding year. From March 21st, 1918, to November 11th in the same year
  the British suffered 830,000 casualties, the French and Belgians 964,000 and
  the Germans 1,470,000. There were also 2,000,000 American troops brought to
  Europe before the end, and of these more than half were actually engaged in
  the fighting. Their casualties were certainly not less than 350,000.
  Portuguese and other contingents from the most unexpected quarters also
  contributed to that culminating death-roll, but it is impossible for us now
  to give exact numbers for these minor forces.</p>

  <p>These are the gross figures of warfare. But War Pictures devotes three
  volumes, perhaps the most horrible of all, to the presentation of various
  details of the fighting in which these vast multitudes suffered and perished.
  These three volumes are like the microscopic slides in a specimen book of
  anatomy, which show us from a selected scrap of tissue the texture of the
  whole. Little figures stand out enlarged, chosen by the hazard that they
  wrote or talked or carried a camera, to represent the nameless millions who
  have left no record. We have accounts of men who were left to lie out for
  days between the lines, tortured by thirst and stifled by the stench of their
  own corruption, and yet who survived to tell the tale. We have the stories of
  men who fell into heaps of rotting dead, and lay there choking, and of men
  who were gassed. The tortures of gas were already many and various, and most
  of the mixtures then used left tormenting weaknesses in the system for the
  rest of life. We have descriptions of the rude surgery of the time and
  abstracts of the mental disorders through which minds fled from reality.
  There are also some dreadful pictures of mutilated men, faceless, crippled,
  grotesquely distorted, and an autobiography of one of the blinded (Outstaying
  My Welcome, by Fritz Schiff, 1923). Scores of thousands of unhappy fragments
  of humanity had to be hidden away in special institutions until they died,
  they were at once so terrifying and so pitiful and hopeless. The world forgot
  them even while they lived.</p>

  <p>The distortion of souls was even more dreadful than the distortion of
  bodies. One of the most lurid items in that dreadful assemblage of realities
  is a lecture on the use of the bayonet, which chanced to be printed,
  reprinted later by anti-war propagandists and so preserved for us, delivered
  by a certain Sergeant-Major Franklin to some English cadets in London. To us
  he is incredible in his ferocity; we are almost forced to believe he was
  drunk or mad, until we realize from the "laughter" that punctuated his
  utterances, from the hearty thanks of his commanding officer, and the "three
  cheers" which rewarded him at the conclusion of his discourse, that he was
  merely expressing the spirit of war service as it was then understood.</p>

  <p>"If you see a wounded German," he said, "shove him out and have no
  nonsense about it."</p>

  <p>He was all against taking prisoners&mdash;and for murdering them after
  surrender. He told with sympathy and approval of how a corporal under him
  butchered a group of German boys. "Can I do these blokes in, sir?" asked the
  corporal, pointing to a bunch of disarmed enemies.</p>

  <p>"Please yourself," said the sergeant-major....</p>

  <p>When they had been "done in", the honest corporal, a released convict from
  Dartmoor prison, came back to the sergeant-major very gratified and honoured,
  and, still in favour, discussed the technical difficulties of withdrawing a
  bayonet quickly in order to be ready for the "next fellow".</p>

  <p>That was, that is, the spirit to which war brings a human being. Sergeant-
  Major Franklin had his abundant equivalents in every army engaged. We are
  able to quote an English document, freely published. Participants in many
  other countries had less freedom. On the whole the English were as gentle as
  any other soldiers. But fear and bloodlust, it is plain, wipe out all the
  slowly acquired restraints and tolerance of social order very quickly and
  completely from any breed of men. History must not be written in pink and
  gilt. Prisoners and wounded were not simply neglected and ill-treated and
  "shoved out". Many were actually tortured to death&mdash;either by way of
  reprisals or in sheer wanton cruelty. There is also a series of photographs
  of foully mutilated bodies, mutilated and indecently displayed while they
  were dying or immediately after they were dead. Those millions marched indeed
  right out of civilization, right out of any sort of human life as we know it
  to-day, marched down to something viler than mere bestiality, when they
  marched into the war zone.</p>

  <p>After the summer of 1918, which brought with it the certainty of ultimate
  defeat, the combatant energy of Germany evaporated. Everywhere there was
  distress and hunger due to a rigorous blockade. The discipline of the land
  relaxed; the country behind the front was infested by stragglers; the Higher
  German Command found itself now, like its antagonists, unable to rely upon
  the men to advance, found itself unable to rely upon their resistance to an
  enemy attack. They became eager to surrender&mdash;taking the off-chance of
  meeting experimental corporals from Dartmoor on the way.</p>

  <p>Wherever there was still loyalty and obedience, however, men were still
  callously sacrificed by the Higher Command. War Pictures (vol. xxvii, 23842
  et seq,) show the German machine-gunners in their pits, on the defensive
  against advancing British and American troops. These men allowed themselves
  to be drugged and chained to their weapons, and so continued to fire and kill
  until the attack came up to them. Then they found small mercy. They were
  bayoneted or their brains were beaten out. They paid for the inventions of
  their masters. They paid for the hatred of Germany the introduction of poison
  gas had evoked in every attacking army. Such residues of senseless devotion
  availed nothing against the massive pressures that were at last exhausting
  Germany. In November the Kaiser, the War Lord, was in flight; a humiliating
  Armistice had been concluded and the German armies were streaming home in
  disorder, incoherently revolutionary.</p>

  <p>Upon that phrase, "incoherently revolutionary", our account of the main
  war may very well end. Here we will only allude to the defeat and
  demoralization of the Italian armies after the battle of Caporetto, when
  800,000 were either killed, wounded, taken prisoner, or (sensible fellows)
  "went home". Nor will we describe the naval battles, of which the chief and
  last was Jutland. It was the last, because afterwards the German admirals
  were faced by the threat of mutiny if they essayed another fight. Whether it
  was or was not a victory for the British was never exactly determined. The
  controversy died out during the Polish wars.</p>

  <p>The War Pictures volumes give many photographs and accounts of these naval
  encounters. We have, for example, a whole series of snapshots of a British
  cruiser in the Battle of Jutland, the Defence steaming at full-speed-ahead to
  attack and finish up a smashed and sinking German battleship, the Wiesbaden.
  The onrush of that fierce mechanism is terrific. It seems invincible and
  overpowering. It has an undeniable splendour. Then suddenly a series of
  blinding flashes show the Defence has been hit by the fire of some other
  German battleship coming to the help of her sister ship, and in a moment she
  has blown up and gone; she is no more than a mounting unfolding column of
  smoke and flying fragments, including, we realize with an effort, the torn
  and scalded bodies of eight hundred men. Then a welter of littered tumbled
  water....</p>

  <p>There is no end to the multitude of such pictures.</p>

  <p>But let us return to our phrase "incoherently revolutionary". That is the
  key to the whole human situation at that time. The distaste for the war
  throughout the world was enormous, if not in its opening phases, then
  certainly before the second year was reached. It bored; it disgusted. Its
  events had none of the smashing decisiveness that seizes the imagination.
  Even the great naval battle of Jutland was, from the point of view of
  spectacle, a complete failure. None the less, for a very simple reason a
  comparatively small minority of resolutely belligerent persons was able to
  keep this vast misery going. On the one hand the war was in accordance with
  the ruling ideas of the time, while on the other the hundreds of millions
  whose astonishment and dismay deepened daily, as horror unfolded beyond
  horror, had no conception of any alternative pattern of life to which they
  could turn as a refuge from its relentless sequences.</p>

  <p>To cry "End the war" ended nothing, because it gave no intimations of what
  had to replace belligerent governments in the control of human affairs. The
  peace the masses craved for was as yet only a featureless negative. But peace
  must be a positive thing, designed and sustained, for peace is less natural
  than warfare. We who have at last won through to the Pax Mundi know how
  strong and resolute, how powerfully equipped and how vigilant, the keepers of
  the peace must be.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap1_08"
     name="chap1_08">8. &mdash; THE IMPULSE TO ABOLISH WAR;<br>
  THE EPISODE OF THE FORD PEACE SHIP</a></h2>

  <p class="first">One quaint expedition, grotesque and childish and yet an
  augury of greater things to come, flits very illuminatingly across the
  dreadful record of these war years. It is the voyage of a passenger steamship
  from New York to Norway. The dark curtains of oblivion fall in heavier and
  heavier folds before the thundering battleships of the twilit Battle of
  Jutland; their forgotten names sink back into a vague general impression of
  huge flame-spouting masses that rush through smoke and mist to their fate;
  only a specialist can tell us now whether the Lützow or the Friedrich der
  Grosse, the Lion, or the Iron Duke, the Vanguard or the Colossus perished
  with its complement of men or staggered out of that battle. They have become
  monstrous irrelevances. There is nothing but their size, and the smashing and
  drowning of hundreds of men in them, to make them more significant to us now
  than an exploding casket of fireworks. But steaming its way across the
  Atlantic a few months before Jutland was fought came this other ship, a
  passenger boat of the Scandinavian-American line, the Oscar II, whose voyage
  remains to this day important and interesting, because in the most simple and
  artless fashion it mingled the new conceptions of life that were coming into
  being, with all the prevalent weaknesses of the time. The Oscar II is better
  known in history as the Peace Ship of Henry Ford. It is a gleam of tragic
  comedy amidst the universal horror.</p>

  <p>This Henry Ford was a very natural-minded mechanical genius, without much
  education or social sophistication, a great friend of, and kindred spirit
  with, that Edison whose career has been traced in the chapter of human
  history dealing with the development and exploitations of inventions at the
  close of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth century. Born and
  brought up in a period of economic expansion, Ford took economic expansion as
  if it were a necessity inherent in things, and never began to doubt continual
  progress until he was a man of over seventy. That was his good fortune. That
  gave him the confidence to design an automobile as sound and good and cheap
  as could be done at that time, and to organize the mass production of his
  pattern with extraordinary energy and skill, because his mind was untroubled
  by the thought that there could be a limit to the number of possible
  purchasers. He marketed his "flivver", or "tin lizzie", as it was
  affectionately called, in enormous quantities, and in consequence he
  revolutionized the road transport and town planning of America. He changed
  the shape of every growing town by enabling the small householder to live
  further from the work and business centre than had ever been possible before.
  He did more than any other single man to drive the horse not only from the
  road but, by making farm tractors, from the fields. He created factories at
  Dearborn that even to-day seem vast. He became enormously rich and an
  outstanding "character" in the world, and particularly in America. And he
  remained curiously simple and direct in his outlook upon life.</p>

  <p>The first effect of the Great War upon him, as on a vast proportion of the
  English-speaking peoples, was incredulous amazement. He had known there were
  armies and sovereign nations in the world, but apparently he had never
  supposed they would fight. He felt there must be some mistake. He exchanged
  views with other Americans in a similar phase of astonishment. By the
  beginning of 1915 they had accumulated a sufficient mass of evidence from the
  belligerent countries to convince them that great masses of people in these
  countries were as amazed and as anxious to end the widening bloodshed and
  brutalization as the neutral onlookers. There had been deputations to the
  President (President Wilson), who was at that time, in harmony with his
  country, highly pacificist, and there was a widespread ambition that the
  United States should evoke some sort of permanent arbitration council alone,
  or in concert with the other Powers still neutral, which should stand, so to
  speak, on the edge of the battlefield and continue to offer its mediatory
  services to the warring governments until they were accepted. There was the
  suggestion of a deputation to Europe to further this idea, and the question
  arose how should it go across the Atlantic. Ford offered to charter a ship to
  take it.</p>

  <p>Then his peculiar imagination seized upon his own offer. He would make
  this ship a spectacular ship; it should be the "Peace Ship". It should take a
  complement of chosen delegates to Europe in such a blaze of publicity that at
  its coming the war would be, as it were, arrested, to look at it. Its mere
  appearance would recall infuriated Europe to its senses. "I want to get those
  boys out of the trenches," said Ford. "They don't want to fight, and would be
  only too glad to shake hands with each other." At the back of his mind there
  seems to have been an idea of calling a general strike at the fronts. "Out of
  the trenches by Christmas, never to return again," was his brief speech at a
  public meeting in Washington in November. All sorts of eminent and energetic
  people were invited to join the mission. He sought the overt approval of the
  President, but the President was far too seasoned a politician to squander
  his publicity upon this "gesture" of Henry Ford's. He was meditating a
  gesture of his own later on.</p>

  <p>American life at that time had its conspicuous popular stars, who embodied
  its ideals of greatness and goodness. Some of them are still for various
  reasons remembered by the historian, Jane Addams and Thomas Edison, for
  example, William Jennings Bryan (the "Last Creationist") and Luther Burbank.
  These names are still to be found even in the Lower School Encyclopaedia.
  Ford tried to include them all in one meteoric shipload. The governors of all
  the states in the Union were also invited, groups of representative
  university students, and so on. The Historical Collection at Atacama has
  gathered all the surviving originals or replicas of Ford's invitations, and
  the replies in which these outstanding individuals hesitated over or evaded
  his proposals. Several were only prevented by sudden attacks of ill-health at
  the very last moment from joining him. And there was a number of newspaper
  reporters, cinema operators and other photographers, stenographers, typists,
  translators, interpreters, baggage masters and publicity agents who made no
  trouble about coming. A certain Madame Rosika Schwimmer, an Hungarian lady,
  gleams forth and vanishes again from history as the organizing spirit of this
  selection. A vast multitude of adventurers and crazy people offered to assist
  when Ford's project was made public, and many were only prevented with the
  utmost difficulty from coming aboard the Oscar II.</p>

  <p>There is still material for a great writer in the details of that
  expedition, but our interest here is neither with the expedition as a whole
  nor with Ford or the other persons concerned in it as personalities, but with
  this idea that flamed and faded, this idea of 'an appeal against war to human
  sanity'. And with the vicissitudes of that idea.</p>

  <p>The first thing to note is that it evoked response, and a very wide
  response. Eminent people, both in America and Europe, with their popularity
  to consider, found it advisable to be sympathetic, even if unhelpful.
  President Wilson, for example, was sympathetic but unhelpful. All the
  pretentious weathercocks of the Western World swung round towards it. We have
  every indication indeed of a very considerable drive towards a world pax in
  these years. But presently the weathercocks began to waver and swing
  away.</p>

  <p>Why did they waver? From the first there was a sustained, malignant
  antagonism to the project. This grew in force and vigour. The American Press,
  and in its wake the European Press, set itself to magnify and distort every
  weakness, every slight absurdity, in the expedition and to invent further
  weaknesses and absurdities. A campaign of ridicule began, so skilful and
  persistent that it stripped away one blushing celebrity after another from
  the constellation, and smothered the essential sanity of the project in their
  wilting apologies. While Ford and his surviving missioners discussed and
  discoursed on their liner, the newspaper men they had brought with them
  concocted lies and absurd stories about their host&mdash;as though they were
  under instructions.</p>

  <p>We know now they were under instructions. The Historical Documents Series
  makes this perfectly plain.</p>

  <p>As our students disentangle strand after strand of that long hidden story,
  we realize more and more clearly the tortuous dishonesty, the confused
  double-mindedness, of the times. The export trade of the United States was
  flourishing under war conditions as it had never flourished before. Munitions
  of every sort were being sold at enormously enhanced prices to the
  belligerents. Such great banking houses as Morgan and Co. were facilitating
  the financial subjugation of Europe to America, through debts for these
  supplies. It is clear that American finance and American Big Business had not
  foreseen this. They had no exceptional foresight. But suddenly they found
  themselves in a position of great advantage, and by all their traditions they
  were bound to make use of that advantage. And Ford in his infinite
  artlessness, "butting in", as they said, "on things that were not his
  business", was setting out to destroy this favourable state of affairs.</p>

  <p>There was just enough plausibility in this endeavour to make it seem
  dangerous. Ford could not be ignored; his available publicity was too great
  for that. He was by no means beneath contempt; so he had to be made
  contemptible. With an earnestness worthy of a better cause, the American
  Press was launched against him. And it was one of the strange traditions of
  the American Press that a newsman should have no scruples. The ordinary
  reporter was a moral invert taking a real pride in his degradation. No
  expedient was too mean, no lie, no trick too contemptible if only it helped
  thwart and disillusion Ford.</p>

  <p>And they did thwart and disillusion him. They got him wrong with himself.
  This half-baked man of genius, deserted by his friends, lost confidence in
  his project. He began to suspect his allies and believe his enemies.</p>

  <p>We have to accept the evidence preserved for us, but even with that
  evidence before us, some of the details of that Press campaign appear
  incredible. There are a hundred gross files of newspaper cuttings at Atacama,
  and some of the most amazing are reproduced in the selected Historical
  Documents. The reporters and writers, who were abroad as Ford's guests,
  invented and sent home by wireless fantastic reports of free fights among the
  members of the mission, of disputes among the leaders, of Ford being chained
  to his bed by his secretary, of mutinies and grotesque happenings. Ford was
  told of and could have prevented these radio messages being sent&mdash;it was
  his ship for the time being&mdash;but a kind of fanaticism for free
  opinion&mdash;even if in practice that meant free lying &mdash;restrained
  him. "Let them do their darnedest," he said, still valiant. "Our work will
  speak for itself."</p>

  <p>But presently he caught the influenza, a lowering disease long since
  extinct but very rife in that period and, under clumsy medical attention of
  the day, he arrived in Europe deflated and tired, physically and morally,
  prepared now to believe that there was something essentially foolish in the
  whole affair. He had been drenched in ridicule beyond his powers of
  resistance, and he was giving way. He gave way.</p>

  <p>"Guess I had better go home to mother," said Mr. Ford, sick in bed in
  Christiania, and kept to his room, though all Norway was agog to greet and
  cheer him.</p>

  <p>But his movement went on by the inertia it had gained. His delegation was
  received with great enthusiasm in Norway and subsequently in Sweden,
  Switzerland, Denmark and Holland, those small sovereign European states which
  contrived so dexterously to keep out of the conflict to the end. People in
  those countries were evidently only too eager to believe that this novel
  intervention might help to end the war. If Ford was discouraged, some of his
  associates were of more persistent material. They held great public meetings
  in Sweden, Holland and Switzerland, and the repercussion of their activities
  certainly had a heartening effect on the peace movement in Germany and
  Britain. They contrived to get speech with a number of politicians and
  statesmen, and they roused the watchful hostility of the German and British
  War authorities&mdash; for the military chiefs of both sides regarded this
  mission very properly as an attack on war morale. A Neutral Conference for
  Continuous Mediation came into being&mdash;very precarious being&mdash;in
  Stockholm. It is claimed that it checked a movement to bring Sweden into the
  war on the side of the Germans.</p>

  <p>Then gradually the Ford Organization for Peace lost prominence. It was
  overshadowed by greater movements towards negotiation, and more particularly
  by the large uncertain gestures of President Wilson, who, re-elected as "the
  man who kept the United States out of the war," brought his people from a
  phase of hypocritical pacificism and energetic armament into the war in 1917.
  Before that culmination the Peace Ship bladder had collapsed altogether. Its
  last typist and photographer and clerk had been paid off, and Ford himself
  was already doing all that was humanly possible to draw a blanket of oblivion
  over that unforgettable Peace Ship. But the records have been too much for
  him.</p>

  <p>He had not led his expeditionary force in Europe, even nominally, for more
  than five weeks. He had kept to his Norwegian hotel, avoided his more
  enthusiastic associates, started a vigorous reduction of his financial
  commitments, and finally bolted home. He deserted. He left his hotel at
  Christiania, stealthily, at five o'clock in the morning, and, in spite of the
  pleadings of those of his party who, warned at the last minute, tumbled out
  of bed to protest, he got away. Before the year was out he had ceased even
  financial support, and the various men and women who had abandoned careers
  and positions and faced ridicule and odium in complete faith in his
  simplicity were left to find their way back to their former niches or
  discover fresh ones.</p>

  <p>Now what had happened to his great idea? What strange reversal of motive
  had occurred in the brain and heart of this Peace Crusader? There the curious
  historian must needs speculate, for that brain and heart have gone now beyond
  all closer scrutiny.</p>

  <p>It has to be noted first that while the Peace Ship was on the Atlantic
  something very significant was going on at Washington. The swiftly growing
  munition industries of America had discovered that a home market for their
  products, a home market of superior solvency, might be added to the vast
  demands of the fighting nations overseas. America, it was argued, might keep
  out of the war&mdash;well and good&mdash;but nevertheless America must be
  "prepared." The United States must arm. The President had weighed this
  proposal with a due regard for the votes and Press support that would come to
  him at the next election; he had weighed it very carefully as became a
  politician, and after some resistance he consented that America should be
  "prepared". Munitions should be assembled, troops should be drilled. Flags
  began to wave&mdash;and the United States flag was a very intoxicating
  one&mdash;and drums and trumpets to sound. Military excitement stirred
  through that vast pacific population and rose.</p>

  <p>And Ford had a mighty industrial plant hitherto engaged in pouring out
  motor-cars and agricultural material, but capable of rapid adaptation to the
  production of war material. It was his creation; it was his embodiment. It
  was all that made him visibly different from any other fellow in the street.
  His friends and family had certainly watched his abandonment of business for
  world affairs with profound misgiving. It may have been plain to them before
  it was plain to him, that if he stood out of this "preparedness" movement as
  he threatened to do, other great plants would arise beside his own, to
  produce war material indeed at first, but capable when the war was over of a
  reverse transformation into great factories for the mass production of
  motorcars and the like. In France this transference from munitions to
  automobiles was actually foreseen and carried out by the Citröen
  organization. It is impossible that this prospect could have escaped
  Ford.</p>

  <p>But in his haste he had declared himself against preparedness. He had
  threatened to hoist an "international flag" over his works in the place of
  the Stars and Stripes....</p>

  <p>It is clear that in that one lively brain all the main forces of the time
  were at work. It had responded vividly and generously to the new drive
  towards a worldpax. Lochner (America's Don Quixote, 1924) reports him thus on
  his sailing from New York:</p>

  <p>"Have you any last word to say?" a journalist enquired.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he replied. "Tell the people to cry peace and fight
  preparedness."</p>

  <p>"What if this expedition fails?" ventured another.</p>

  <p>"If this expedition fails I'll start another," he flashed without a
  moment's hesitation.</p>

  <p>"People say you are not sincere," commented a third....</p>

  <p>"We've got peace-talk going now, and I'll pound it to the end."</p>

  <p>And afterwards came those second thoughts. When, in 1917, the United
  States entered the war, the Peace Ship was a stale old joke and the vast Ford
  establishments were prepared and ready for the production of munitions.</p>

  <p>Ford was a compendium of his age. That is why we give him this prominence
  in our history. The common man of the twentieth century was neither a
  pacifist nor a war-monger. He was both&mdash;and Ford was just a common man
  made big by accident and exceptional energy.</p>

  <p>The main thread in the history of the twentieth century is essentially the
  drama of the indecisions manifested in their elementary plainness by Ford on
  board his Peace Ship. That voyage comes therefore like a tin-whistle solo by
  way of overture, to the complex orchestration of human motive in the great
  struggle for human unity that lay ahead.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap1_09"
     name="chap1_09">9. &mdash; THE DIRECT ACTION OF THE ARMAMENT<br>
  INDUSTRIES IN MAINTAINING WAR STRESSES</a></h2>

  <p class="first">We must now say something about the direct activities of the
  hypertrophied "armament firms" in bringing about and sustaining the massacres
  of the Great War. A proper understanding of that influence is essential if
  the stresses and martyrdoms of the middle years of the twentieth century are
  to be understood.</p>

  <p>These "armament firms" were an outcome of the iron and steel industry,
  which in a few score years between 1700 and 1850 grew up&mdash;no man
  objecting&mdash;from a modest activity of artisans to relatively gigantic
  possibilities of production. This industry covered the world with a network
  of railways, and produced iron and then steel steamships to drive the wooden
  sailing ships off the seas. And at an early stage (all this is traced in full
  detail in Luke Zimmern's Entwickelung und Geschichte von Kruppismus, 1913;
  Hist. Doc. 394112) it turned its attention to the weapons in the world.</p>

  <p>In a perpetual progress in the size and range of great guns, in a vast
  expansion of battleships that were continually scrapped in favour of larger
  or more elaborate models, it found a most important and inexhaustible field
  of profit. The governments of the world were taken unawares, and in a little
  while the industry, by sound and accepted methods of salesmanship, was able
  to impose its novelties upon these ancient institutions with their tradition
  of implacable mutual antagonism. It was realized very soon that any decay of
  patriotism and loyalty would be inimical to this great system of profits, and
  the selling branch of the industry either bought directly or contrived to
  control most of the great newspapers of the time, and exercised a watchful
  vigilance on the teaching of belligerence in schools. Following the
  established rules and usages for a marketing industrialism, and with little
  thought of any consequences but profits, the directors of these huge concerns
  built up the new warfare that found its first exposition in the Great War of
  1914-18, and gave its last desperate and frightful convulsions in the Polish
  wars of 1940 and the subsequent decades.</p>

  <p>Even at its outset in 1914-18 this new warfare was extraordinarily
  uncongenial to humanity. It did not even satisfy man's normal combative
  instincts. What an angry man wants to do is to beat and bash another living
  being, not to be shot at from ten miles distance or poisoned in a hole.
  Instead of drinking delight of battle with their peers, men tasted all the
  indiscriminating terror of an earthquake. The war literature stored at
  Atacama, to which we have already referred, is full of futile protest against
  the horror, the unsportsmanlike quality, the casual filthiness and indecency,
  the mechanical disregard of human dignity of the new tactics. But such
  protest itself was necessarily futile, because it did not go on to a clear
  indictment of the forces that were making, sustaining and distorting war. The
  child howled and wept and they did not even attempt to see what it was had
  tormented it.</p>

  <p>To us nowadays it seems insane that profit-making individuals and
  companies should have been allowed to manufacture weapons and sell the
  apparatus of murder to all comers. But to the man of the late nineteenth and
  early twentieth centuries it seemed the most natural thing in the world. It
  had grown up in an entirely logical and necessary way, without any restraint
  upon the normal marketing methods of peace-time commerce, from the
  continually more extensive application of new industrial products to warfare.
  Even after the World War catastrophe, after that complete demonstration of
  the futility of war, men still allowed themselves to be herded like sheep
  into the barracks, to be trained to consume, and be consumed, by new lines of
  slaughter goods produced and marketed by the still active armament traders.
  And the accumulation of a still greater and still more dangerous mass of war
  material continued.</p>

  <p>There is a queer little pseudo-scientific essay by a Bengali satirist
  (Professor K. Chondra Sen, 1897-1942) among the India series of reprints,
  professing to be a study of the relative stupidity of the more intelligent
  animals up to and including man. He is concerned by the fatuity with which
  the mass of humanity watched the preparation of its own destruction during
  this period. He considers the fate of various species of penguins which were
  then being swept out of the world&mdash;the twentieth century was an age of
  extermination for hundreds of species&mdash;and infers a similar destiny for
  mankind. He begins with the slaughter of the penguins; he gives photographs
  of these extraordinary creatures in their multitudes, gathered on the beaches
  of Oceanic islands and watching the advance of their slayers. One sees them
  scattered over a long sloping shore, standing still, or waddling about or
  flapping their stumpy wings while the massacre goes on. They seem to be
  vaguely interested in the killing of their fellows, but in no way stirred
  either to flight or resistance. (No thorough scientific observations, we may
  note, were ever made of penguin mentality, the revival of experimental
  psychology comes too late for that, and we are left now to guess at what went
  on in these queer brains of theirs during these raids. There is evidence to
  show that these creatures had curiosity, kindliness, sympathy and humour; and
  they were eminently teachable. They stood quite high in the scale of bird
  intelligence. And yet they permitted their own extinction.) They were not so
  much a-mental, Professor Sen insists, half seriously, half mockingly, as
  defective and wrong. They were capable of many idea systems but not of the
  idea of social preservation. He suggests, too, that the same was true of the
  sea elephants which were also very rapidly destroyed. (The last of these were
  murdered later "to make a record" by a Japanese lunatic with a craving for an
  "immortal Name" when the protective patrol was withdrawn during the "revolt
  of the sea pirates" in C.E. 1985.) But after Professor Sen has weighed every
  possible case, he still awards the palm for complaisant social stupidity to
  man.</p>

  <p>With a fine parody of the social research methods of that time, he gives
  various photographs of what he calls the "human penguins" of that early
  Twentieth Century, waddling in their sleek thousands to see battleships
  launched, to rejoice over reviews and parades, to watch their army aeroplanes
  stunting in the sky. Side by side he gives photographs of penguin assemblies
  that, either by happy accident or skilful rearrangement, are absurdly
  parallel. He gives lists of shareholders in the armament firms, including the
  current Bishop of Hereford, the current President of the Free Church Council,
  a great multitude of clergymen, artists, judges and every sort of gentlefolk.
  He quotes extensively from the Hansard records of various debates in the
  British House of Commons (in a debate on the Naval Estimates early in 1914,
  Philip Snowden, the radical socialist who afterwards became Viscount Snowden,
  was particularly explicit), showing that the nature of the danger was clearly
  seen and clearly and publicly stated. Only it was not FELT. It is upon that
  little difference between factual apprehension and the kind of apprehension
  that leads to effective action that our interest concentrates here.</p>

  <p>Why did humanity gape at the guns and do nothing? And why, after the Great
  War, after that generation had seen over twenty million human beings perish
  painfully and untimely did it still go on, doing nothing adequate to the
  occasion? With the preparations still mounting up and the horrible
  possibilities of war increasing under its eyes? The great Cradle of Bethlehem
  Steel Corporation of America in 1929 was revealed as actively opposing naval
  disarmament at the Geneva Conference of 1927. At any rate it was associated
  with three shipbuilding companies who were sued by a Mr. Shearer, who claimed
  to have been given that task, for fees alleged to be due to him. There seems
  to have been little dispute that he had been so employed; the case turned
  upon the extent of his services and the amount of his fees. Nothing was done
  by the penguins either to the companies concerned or to Mr. Shearer. A few
  expressed indignation; that was all. Just as now and then no doubt a bird or
  so squawked at the oil hunters. For a detailed account and references see The
  Navy: Defence or Portent by C. A. Beard, 1930, reprinted Hist. Doc. Series
  4,270,112.</p>

  <p>The clue lies in the fact that there was practically no philosophical
  education at all in the world, no intelligent criticism of generalizations
  and general ideas. There was no science of social processes at all. People
  were not trained to remark the correlations of things; for the most part they
  were not aware that there was any correlation between things; they imagined
  this side of life might change and that remain unaltered. The industrialists
  and financiers built up these monstrous armaments and imposed them on the
  governments of the time, with a disregard of consequences that seems now
  absolutely imbecile. Most of these armament propagandists were admirable in
  their private lives: gentle lovers, excellent husbands, fond of children and
  animals, good fellows, courteous to inferiors, and so on. Sir Basil Zaharoff,
  the greatest of munition salesmen, as one sees him in the painting (ascribed
  to Orpen) recently discovered in Paris, with his three-cornered hat, his neat
  little moustaches and beardlet, and the ribbon of some Order of Chivalry
  about his neck, looks quite a nice, if faintly absurd, little gentleman.
  Those shareholding bishops and clergy may, for anything we know to the
  contrary, have had charming personalities. But they wanted their dividends.
  And in order to pay them those dividends, the dread of war and the need of
  war had to be kept alive in the public mind.</p>

  <p>That was done most conveniently through the Press. You could buy a big
  newspaper in those days, lock, stock and barrel, for five or ten million
  dollars, and the profits made on one single battleship came to more than
  that. Naturally, and according to the best business traditions, the
  newspapers hired or sold themselves to the war salesmen. What was wrong in
  that? Telling the news in those days was a trade, not a public duty. A daily
  paper that had dealt faithfully with this accumulating danger would quite as
  naturally and necessarily have found its distribution impeded, have found
  itself vigorously outdone by more richly endowed competitors, able because of
  their wealth to buy up all the most attractive features, able to outdo it in
  every way with the common reader.</p>

  <p>It wasn't that the newspaper owners and the munition dealers wanted anyone
  hurt. They only wanted to sell equipment and see it used up. Nor was it that
  the newspapers desired the wholesale mangling and butchering of human beings.
  They wanted sales and advertisements. The butchery was quite by the way, an
  unfortunate side issue to legitimate business. Shortsightedness is not
  diabolical, even if it produces diabolical results.</p>

  <p>And even those soldiers? Freudheim, in his analysis of the soldierly mind,
  shows a picture of that Sir Henry Wilson we have already mentioned, arrayed
  in shirt-sleeves and digging modestly in the garden of his villa during a
  phase of retirement, and the same individual smirking in all his glory,
  buttons, straps and "decorations", as a director of military operations. It
  is an amazing leap from the suburban insignificance of a retired clerk to
  godlike importance. In peace time, on the evidence of his own diaries, this
  Wilson was a tiresome nobody, an opinionated bore; in war he passed beyond
  criticism and became a god. One understands at once what a vital matter
  employment and promotion must have been to him. But so far as we can tell he
  desired no killing AS killing. If he had been given blood to drink he would
  probably have been sick. Yet he lived upon tanks of blood.</p>

  <p>These professional soldiers thought of slaughter as little as possible. It
  is preposterous to say they desired it, much less that they gloated over it.
  It might have fared better with their men if they had thought of it more.
  They had an age-old sentimental devotion to their country, a solemn sense of
  great personal worth in their services, an orgiastic delight of battle. And
  they did not see, nor want to see, what was beyond their occupation. Their
  religious teachers were quite ready to assure them they were correct in all
  they did and were.</p>

  <p>The senescent Christian Churches of that age had indeed a very direct
  interest in war. A marked tendency to ignore or ridicule the current
  religious observances had become manifest, but under the stresses of loss and
  death people turned again to the altar. It is easily traceable in the fiction
  of the time. The despised curate of the tea-cups and croquet lawn became the
  implicitly heroic "padre" of the sentimental war stories.</p>

  <p>The problem that confronted the growing minority that was waking up to the
  perils and possibilities of our species in the third and fourth decades of
  the twentieth century was this: How in the first place to concentrate the
  minds of people onto this state of distraction and diffusion, how to bring
  them to bear upon the crude realities before them, and then how to organize
  the gigantic effort needed to shake off that intermittent and ever more
  dangerous fever of war and that chronic onset of pauperization which
  threatened the whole world with social dissolution.</p>

  <p>There was no central antagonist, no ruling devil, for those anxious
  spirits to fight. That would have made it a straight, understandable
  campaign. But the Press with a certain flavouring of pious intentions was
  practically against them. Old social and political traditions, whatever the
  poses they assumed, were tacitly against them. History was against them, for
  it could but witness that war had always gone on since its records began. Not
  only the current Bishop of Hereford, and the current President of the Free
  Church Council, caught with their dividends upon them, but their Churches and
  the Catholic Church, and indeed all the Christian Churches, in spite of their
  allegiance to the Prince of Peace, were quietly competitive with, or
  antagonistic to, the secular world controls that alone could make a healthy
  world peace possible. The admission of the insufficiency of their own creeds
  to comfort or direct would have been the necessary prelude to a new moral
  effort.</p>

  <p>And the idea of the naturalness and inevitability of war was not only
  everywhere in the world around those few forward-looking men who knew better,
  it was in their blood and habits. They were seeking how to attack not a
  fortress, but what seemed a perpetually recuperative jungle of mixed motives,
  tangled interests and cross-purposes, within themselves as without.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap1_10"
     name="chap1_10">10. &mdash; VERSAILLES: SEED BED OF DISASTERS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The formal war, against the Central Powers, the "World War",
  ended on November 11, 1918, C.E. in the defeat and submission of the Central
  Powers. There was a conference at Versailles, in the same palace in which
  triumphant Germans had dictated peace to France after a previous war in
  1870-71. There was a needlessly dramatic flavour in this reversal of the
  rôles of the two countries. It was now France and her allies who dictated,
  and naturally the ideas of a romantic restoration and a stern and righteous
  judgment dominated the situation. The assembled Powers sat down to right the
  wrongs and punish the misdeeds of their grandparents. Even at the time it
  seemed a little belated. But threading their proceedings we do find quite
  plainly evident the developing conflict between historical tradition and the
  quickening sense of human unity in the world. If the World-State was not
  present at the conference, its voice was at any rate "heard without".</p>

  <p>By this time (1919 C.E.) there was indeed quite a considerable number of
  intelligent people in the world who had realized the accumulating necessity
  of a world government, and a still larger multitude, like that Henry Ford we
  have described, who had apprehended it instinctively and sentimentally, but
  there was no one yet who had had the intellectual vigour to attack in earnest
  the problem of substituting a world system for the existing governments.
  Men's minds and hearts quailed before that undertaking. And yet, as we now
  know so clearly, it was the only thing for them to do. It was the sole
  alternative to an ever-broadening and deepening series of disasters. But its
  novelty and vastness held them back. Irrational habit kept them in the
  ancient currents of history.</p>

  <p>To us they seem like drowning men who were willing to attempt to save
  themselves by rallies of swimming, floating, holding on to straws and
  bubbles, but who refused steadfastly, in spite of the proximity of a ladder,
  to clamber out of the water for good and all.</p>

  <p>Hardly any of them in their ideas of a world system dared go beyond a
  purely political agreement for the avoidance of war. Five decades of human
  distress were still needed before there was to be any extensive realization
  that belligerence was only one symptom, and by no means the gravest symptom,
  of human disunion.</p>

  <p>The American President Woodrow Wilson, of all the delegates to the Peace
  Conference, was the most susceptible to the intimations of the future. The
  defects and limitations of his contributions to that settlement give us a
  measure of the political imagination of those days. He brought what was left
  of the individualistic liberalism that had created the American Republics to
  the solution of the world problem. None of the other participants in these
  remarkable discussions&mdash;Clemenceau (France), Lloyd George (Britain),
  Sonnino (Italy), Saionji (Japan), Hymans (Belgium), Paderewski (Poland),
  Bratianu (Roumania), Benes (Bohemia), Venezelos (Greece), Feisal (Hedjaz),
  and so on through a long list of now fading names&mdash;seemed aware that,
  apart from any consideration of national advantage, humanity as a whole might
  claim an interest in the settlement. They were hard-shell "representatives",
  national advocates. For a brief interval Wilson stood alone for mankind. Or
  at least he seemed to stand for mankind. And in that brief interval there was
  a very extraordinary and significant wave of response to him throughout the
  earth. So eager was the situation that all humanity leapt to accept and
  glorify Wilson&mdash; for a phrase, for a gesture. It seized upon him as its
  symbol. He was transfigured in the eyes of men. He ceased to be a common
  statesman; he became a Messiah. Millions believed him as the bringer of
  untold blessings; thousands would gladly have died for him. That response was
  one of the most illuminating events in the early twentieth century.
  Manifestly the World-State had been conceived then, and now it stirred in the
  womb. It was alive.</p>

  <p>And then for some anxious decades it ceased to stir.</p>

  <p>Amidst different scenery and in different costumes, the story of Wilson
  repeats the story of Ford, the story of a man lifted by an idea too great for
  him, thrown up into conspicuousness for a little while and then dropped, as a
  stray leaf may be spun up and dropped by a gust of wind before a gale. The
  essential Wilson, the world was soon to learn, was vain and theatrical, with
  no depth of thought and no wide generosity. So far from standing for all
  mankind, he stood indeed only for the Democratic Party in the United
  States&mdash;and for himself. He sacrificed the general support of his people
  in America to party considerations and his prestige in Europe to a craving
  for social applause. For a brief season he was the greatest man alive. Then
  for a little while he remained the most conspicuous. He visited all the
  surviving courts of Europe and was fêted and undone in every European
  capital. That triumphal procession to futility need not occupy us further
  here. Our concern is with his idea.</p>

  <p>Manifestly he wanted some sort of a world pax. But it is doubtful if at
  any time he realized that a world pax means a world control of all the vital
  common interests of mankind. He seems never to have thought out this job to
  which he set his hand so confidently. He did not want, or, if he did, he did
  not dare to ask for, any such centralized world controls as we now possess.
  They were probably beyond the range of his reading and understanding. His
  project from first to last was purely a politician's project.</p>

  <p>The pattern conceived by him was a naïve adaptation of the parliamentary
  governments of Europe and America to a wider union. His League, as it emerged
  from the Versailles Conference, was a typical nineteenth-century government
  enlarged to planetary dimensions and greatly faded in the process; it had an
  upper chamber, the Council, and a lower chamber, the Assembly, but, in ready
  deference to national susceptibilities, it had no executive powers, no
  certain revenues, no army, no police, and practically no authority to do
  anything at all. And even as a political body it was remote and ineffective;
  it was not in any way representative of the peoples of the earth as
  distinguished from the governments of the earth. Practically nothing was done
  to make the common people of the world feel that the League was theirs. Its
  delegates were appointed by the Foreign Offices of the very governments its
  only conceivable rôle was to supersede. They were national politicians and
  they were expected to go to Geneva to liquidate national politics. The League
  came into being at last, a solemn simulacrum to mock, cheat and dispel the
  first desire for unity that mankind had ever betrayed.</p>

  <p>Yet what else was possible then? If Wilson seemed to embody the formless
  aspirations of mankind, there can be no dispute that he impressed the
  politicians with whom he had to deal as a profoundly insincere visionary.
  They dealt with him as that and they beat him as that. The only way to have
  got anything more real than this futile League would have been a
  revolutionary appeal to the war-weary peoples of the earth against their
  governments, to have said, as indeed he could have said in 1918, to the whole
  world that the day of the World-State had come. That would have reverberated
  to the ends of the earth.</p>

  <p>He was not the man to do that. He had not that power of imagination. He
  had not that boldness with governments. He had the common politician's way of
  regarding great propositions as a means to small ends. If he had been bolder
  and greater, he might have failed, he might have perished; but he failed and
  perished anyhow; and a bolder bid for world unity might have put the real
  issue before mankind for ever and shortened the Age of Frustration by many
  decades.</p>

  <p>What he did do was to reap an immediate harvest of popular applause, to
  present to human hope a white face rigid with self-approval, bowing from
  processional carriages and decorated balconies, retiring gravely into secret
  conference with the diplomatists and politicians of the old order and
  emerging at last with this League of Nations, that began nothing and ended
  nothing and passed in a couple of decades out of history.</p>

  <p>It was a League not to end sovereignties but preserve them. It stipulated
  that the extraordinarily ill-contrived boundaries established by the Treaty
  in which it was incorporated should be guaranteed by the League for EVERMORE.
  Included among other amiable arrangements were clauses penalizing Germany and
  her allies as completely as Carthage was penalized by Rome after the disaster
  of Zamia&mdash; penalizing her in so overwhelming a way as to make default
  inevitable and afford a perennial excuse for her continued abasement. It was
  not a settlement, it was a permanent punishment. The Germans were to become
  the penitent helots of the conquerors; a generation, whole generations, were
  to be born and die in debt, and to ensure the security of this arrangement
  Germany was to be effectually disarmed and kept disarmed.</p>

  <p>Delenda est Germanic was the sole idea of the French (see Morris Henbane's
  Study of Pertinax, 1939) and the representatives of the other Allies who were
  gathered together in the Paris atmosphere, and, working amidst the vindictive
  memories of Versailles, were only too ready to fall in with this punitive
  conception of their task. It was the easiest conception; it put a hundred
  difficult issues into a subordinate place. It always looks so much easier to
  men of poor imagination to put things back than to carry them on. If the
  French dreaded a resurrection of the German armies, the British feared a
  resurrection of the German fleet and of German industrial competition. Japan
  and Italy, seeking their own compensations elsewhere, were content to see the
  German-speaking peoples, who constituted the backbone of the continent,
  divided and reduced to vassalage.</p>

  <p>The antiquated form of Wilson's ideas produced still more mischievous
  consequences in the multiplication of sovereign governments in the already
  congested European area. Deluded by the vague intimations of unity embodied
  in the League, Wilson lent himself readily to a reconstruction of the map of
  Europe upon strictly nationalist lines. The Polish nation was restored. Our
  history has already studied the successive divisions of this country in the
  eighteenth century. It is a great region of the Central Plain, whose
  independent existence became more and more inconvenient as the trade and
  commerce of Europe developed. Geography fought against it. It was a
  loose-knit union of individualistic equestrian aristocrats dominating a
  peasantry. But its partition between Russia, Prussia and Austria was achieved
  with the utmost amount of brutality, and after the Napoleonic wars a romantic
  legend about this lost kingdom of Poland seized upon the sentiment of France,
  Britain and America. These rude nobles and their serfs, so roughly
  incorporated by the adjacent states, were transfigured into a delicate, brave
  and altogether wonderful people, a people with a soul torn asunder and
  trampled underfoot by excessively booted oppressors. The restoration of
  Poland&mdash;the excessive restoration of Poland&mdash;was one of the
  brightest ambitions of President Wilson.</p>

  <p>Poland was restored. But instead of a fine-spirited and generous people
  emerging from those hundred and twenty years of subjugation, and justifying
  the sympathy and hopes of liberalism throughout the world, there appeared a
  narrowly patriotic government, which presently developed into an aggressive,
  vindictive and pitiless dictatorship, and set itself at once to the zestful
  persecution of the unfortunate ethnic minorities (about a third of the entire
  population) caught in the net of its all too ample boundaries. The real
  Poland of the past had been a raiding and aggressive nation which had ridden
  and harried to the very walls of Moscow. It had not changed its nature. The
  Lithuanian city of Vilna was now grabbed by a coup de main and the
  southeastern boundary pushed forward in Galicia. In the treatment of the
  Ukrainians and Ruthenians involved in liberation, Poland equalled any of the
  atrocities which had been the burden of her song during her years of
  martyrdom. In 1932 one-third of the budget of this new militant Power was for
  armament.</p>

  <p>Not only was Poland thus put back upon the map. As a result of a sedulous
  study of historical sentimentalities, traditions, dialects and local
  feelings, a whole cluster of new sovereign Powers, Czechoslovakia,
  Jugoslavia, Finland, Esthonia, Latvia, Lithuania, an attenuated Hungary and
  an enlarged Roumania, was evoked to crowd and complicate the affairs of
  mankind by their sovereign liberties, their ambitions, hostilities,
  alliances, understandings, misunderstandings, open and secret treaties,
  tariffs, trade wars and the like. Russia was excluded from the first attempt
  at a World Parliament because she had repudiated her vast war
  debts&mdash;always a matter of grave solicitude to the Western creditor,
  and&mdash;strangest fact of all in this strange story&mdash;the United
  States, the Arbitrator and Restorer of Nations, stood out from the League,
  because President Wilson's obstinate resolve to monopolize the immortal glory
  of World Salvation for himself and his party had estranged a majority of his
  senators.</p>

  <p>The Senate, after some attempts at compromise, rejected the Covenant of
  the League altogether, washed its hands of world affairs, and the President,
  instead of remaining for ever Prince of Everlasting Peace and Wonder of the
  Ages, shrank again very rapidly to human proportions and died a broken and
  disappointed man. Like Ford, the United States returned to normal business
  and the Profit and Loss Account, and the Europeans were left with the name of
  Wilson written all over their towns, upon streets, avenues, esplanades,
  railway stations, parks and squares, to make what they could of this
  emasculated League he had left about among their affairs.</p>

  <p>If Russia and Germany in their character of Bad Peoples were excluded from
  the League, such remote peoples as the Chinese and the Japanese were included
  as a matter of course. It was assumed, apparently, that they were "just
  fellows" of the universal Treaty-of-Westphalia pattern. The European world
  knew practically nothing of the mental processes of these remote and ancient
  communities, and it seems hardly to have dawned upon the conferring statesmen
  that political processes rest entirely upon mental facts. The League, after
  much difficulty, and after some years' delay, did indeed evolve a Committee
  of Intellectual Cooperation, but so far as its activities can now be traced,
  this was concerned with dilettante intellectualism only; there is no
  indication that it ever interested itself in the League as an idea.</p>

  <p>Considering all things in the light of subsequent events, it would have
  been well if the League of Nations had committed hara-kiri directly the
  United States Senate refused participation, and if the European Powers,
  realizing their failure to stabilize the planet at one blow, had set
  themselves at once to the organization of a League of Conciliation and
  Cooperation within the European area. The League's complete inability to
  control or even modify the foreign policy of Japan (modelled on the best
  nineteenth-century European patterns) was the decisive factor in its
  declension to a mere organization of commentary upon current affairs.</p>

  <p>As its authority declined the courage and pungency of its reports
  increased. Some of the later ones are quite admirable historical documents.
  Gradually the member governments discontinued their subsidies and the
  secretariat dwindled to nothing. Like the Hague Tribunal, the League faded
  out of existence before or during the Famished Fifties. It does not figure in
  history after the first Polish war, but its official buildings were intact in
  1965, and in 1968, and for some years later, they were used as auxiliary
  offices by the Western branch of the Transport Union.</p>

  <p>The imposition of vast monetary payments upon Germany was the only part of
  the settlement of Versailles that dealt with the financial and economic life
  of our race. Astounding as this seems to us to-day, it was the most natural
  oversight possible to the Versailles politicians. Political life was still
  deep in the old purely combatant tradition, still concentrated upon
  boundaries and strategic advantages; and it was extraordinarily innocent in
  the face of economic realities. The mighty forces demanding economic
  unification, albeit they were, as we have shown, the real causes of the Great
  War, were ignored at Versailles as completely as if they had never
  existed.</p>

  <p>Only one outstanding voice, that of the British economist J. M. Keynes
  (Economic Consequences of the Peace, 1919), was audible at the time in
  protest and warning against the preposterous dislocation of credit and trade
  involved in the reparation payments. There was no arrangement whatever for
  the liquidation of the debts piled up by the Allies AGAINST EACH OTHER (!),
  and no economic parallel to the political League of Nations. No control of
  economic warfare was even suggested. The Americans, Wilson included, were
  still in a stage of financial individualism; they thought money-getting was
  an affair of individual smartness within the limits of the law, and the
  American conception of law was of something that presented interesting
  obstacles rather than effectual barriers to enlightened self-seeking. The
  contemporary American form of mutual entertainment was a poker party, and
  that great people therefore found nothing inimical in sitting down after the
  war to play poker, with France and Great Britain as its chief opponents, for
  the gold and credit of the world.</p>

  <p>It was only slowly during the decade following after the war that the
  human intelligence began to realize that the Treaty of Versailles had not
  ended the war at all. It had set a truce to the bloodshed, but it had done so
  only to open a more subtle and ultimately more destructive phase in the
  traditional struggle of the sovereign states. The existence of independent
  sovereign states IS war, white or red, and only an elaborate mis-education
  blinded the world to this elementary fact. The peoples of the defeated
  nations suffered from a real if not very easily defined sense of injustice in
  this Treaty, which was framed only for them to sign, and sign in the rôle of
  wrongdoers brought to book. Very naturally they were inspired by an
  ill-concealed resolve to revise, circumvent or disregard its provisions at
  the earliest possible opportunity. The conquering Powers, on the other hand,
  were conscious of having not only humiliated their defeated enemies but
  thrust them into a state of exasperated disadvantage. The thought of a
  revanche was equally present therefore to the victors, and instead of
  disarming as the Germans were compelled to do, they broke the obligations of
  the Treaty and retained and increased their military establishments.</p>

  <p>The armament firms and their newspapers naturally did all they could to
  intensify this persistence in an armed "security". Any disposition on the
  part of the French public, for instance, to lay aside its weapons was
  promptly checked by tales of secret arsenals and furtive drilling in Germany.
  And the narrow patriotic forces that guided France not only kept her
  extravagantly armed against her fallen foe, but carried on a subtle but
  ruthless financial warfare that, side by side with the American game,
  overcame every effort of Germany to recover socially or economically.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the conquering Powers, so soon as they considered their former
  antagonists conclusively disposed of, turned themselves frankly, in full
  accordance with the traditions of the sovereign state system, to the task of
  getting the better of each other in the division of the spoils. Their
  "Alliances" had brought about no sense of community. Already within a year of
  the signing of the Peace Treaty of Versailles heavy fighting was going on in
  Asia Minor between the Greeks and the Turks. The Greeks had British
  encouragement; the French and Italians had supported the Turks. It was a war
  of catspaws. This war culminated in a disastrous rout of the Greeks and the
  burning of the town of Smyrna. This last was a quite terrible massacre;
  multitudes of women and children were outraged, men and boys gouged,
  emasculated or killed; all but the Turkish quarter was looted and burnt. The
  quays in front of the flaming town were dense with terror-stricken crowds,
  hoping against hope to get away upon some ship before they were fallen upon,
  robbed, butchered, or thrust into the water.</p>

  <p>A little before this the Turks had driven the French out of the ancient
  province of Cilicia, and had completed the extermination of that ancient
  people the Hittites or Armenians. During the war or after the war mattered
  little to the Armenians, for fire and sword pursued them still. Over two
  million died&mdash; for the most part violent deaths.</p>

  <p>Fighting still went on after the Great Peace in the north and south of
  Russia and in eastern Siberia; and China became a prey to armies of
  marauders. Poland seized Vilna, invaded eastern Galicia and fought Russia in
  the Ukraine, and a raid of patriotic Italians expelled a mixed Allied
  garrison from Fiume.</p>

  <p>Presently there was a dreadful famine in south-east Russia which neither
  America nor Europe was able to alleviate. Always before the war a famine in
  any part of the world had exercised the philanthropic element in the
  Anglo-Saxon community. But philanthropy had lost heart. There was a faint but
  insufficient flutter of the old habits in America but none in Britain.</p>

  <p>Such was the peace and union of the world immediately achieved by the
  Conference of Versailles.</p>

  <p>A number of unsatisfactory appendices and patches had presently to be made
  to correct the most glaring defects and omissions of the Treaty.
  Constantinople, which had been taken from the Turks and held by a mixed force
  of the Allies, was restored to them in 1923 after the Smyrna massacre and
  some warlike gesticulation between them and the British.</p>

  <p>In drawing the boundaries of the new and revised states of the European
  patchwork there was the utmost disregard of economic commonsense; peasants
  would find themselves cut off from winter or summer pasture or from market
  towns which had been developed by their needs. Great foundries and chemical
  and metallurgical works were separated from the ores and deposits on which
  they relied. Vienna, once the financial and business centre of all south-east
  Central Europe, was decapitated. Most fantastic and, as it proved, most
  disastrous of all the follies of Versailles, was the creation of the free
  city of Danzig and what was called the Polish Corridor.</p>

  <p>Let us note a point or so about this latter tangle to illustrate the
  mental quality of the Conference at its worst. Here more than anywhere else
  did the simple romantic idea that the Germans were Bad, and that anyone
  opposed to the Germans was without qualification Good, rule the situation.
  The Poles were Good, and they were the chosen of the Allies, the particular
  protégés of the sentimental historian from America. He had come to put down
  the mighty from their seats and to exalt the humble and the meek. The hungry
  and eager were to be filled with good things and the rich, the erstwhile
  rich, were to be sent empty away. Germany, like Dives in hell, was to look up
  and see Poland like Lazarus in Woodrow Wilson's bosom. Not only were the Good
  Poles to be given dominion over Ruthenians, Ukrainians, Jews (whom
  particularly they detested), Lithuanians, White Russians and Germans, they
  were to have also something of profound economic importance&mdash;"access to
  the sea".</p>

  <p>On that President Wilson had been very insistent. Switzerland had done
  very well in pre-war Europe without access to the sea, but that was another
  story. The difficulty was that by no stretch of ethnic map-colouring could
  Poland be shown to border on the sea. A belt of Pomeranians and Germans
  stretched across the mouth of the Vistula, and the only possibility of a
  reasonable trading outlet to the sea, so far as Poland needed such an
  outlet&mdash;for most of its trade was with its immediate
  neighbours&mdash;was through an understanding with that belt of people. That
  would have been easy enough to arrange. At the mouth of the Vistula stood the
  entirely German city of Danzig. It lived mainly as an outlet for Polish
  trade, and it could prosper in no other way. There was no reason to suppose
  it would put any difficulties in the way of Polish imports and exports. It
  was an ancient, honest, clean and prosperous German city. Ninety-six per cent
  of its inhabitants were German.</p>

  <p>This was the situation to which the Conference of Versailles, under the
  inspiration of that magic phrase "access to the sea", turned its attention.
  Even the profound belief of the Conquerors that there were no Germans but bad
  Germans could not justify their turning over Danzig itself to Polish rule.
  But they separated it from Germany and made it into a "free city", and to the
  west of it they achieved that "access to the sea" of Wilson's, by annexing a
  broad band of Pomeranian territory to Poland. (This was the actual "Corridor"
  of the controversies.) It had no port to compare with Danzig, but the Poles
  set themselves to create a rival in Gdynia, which should be purely Polish,
  and which should ultimately starve the trading Germans out of Danzig.</p>

  <p>And to keep the waters of the Vistula as pure and sweet for Poland as the
  existence of Danzig at the estuary allowed, the peace-makers ran the Vistula
  boundary between Poland and east Prussia, not in the usual fashion midway
  along the stream, but at a little distance on the east Prussian side.
  (Jacques Kayser, La Paix en Péril, 1931; Hist. Doc., 711711.) So that the
  east German population, the peasant cultivator, the erstwhile fisherman, the
  shepherd with his flocks to water, was pulled up by a line of frontier posts
  and a Polish rifle within sight of the stream. Moreover, that eastward
  country was flat and low-lying and had hitherto been protected from floods
  and a relapse to marsh conditions by a line of dykes. The frontier cut that
  line five times, and since the Poles had no interest whatever in these
  defences, they fell rapidly out of repair. Further along the boundary cut off
  the great towns of Garnsee and Bischofswerder from their railway station.</p>

  <p>But we must not lose ourselves in the details of this exasperating
  settlement. The maximum of irritation developed in the absurd Corridor
  itself. The current of traffic had hitherto run to and fro between east and
  west, the trend of the railways was in that direction; the traffic in the
  north and south direction had come to Danzig along the great river. Now the
  Poles set themselves to obstruct both these currents and to wrench round all
  the communications into a north and south direction avoiding Danzig. Every
  German going east or west found himself subjected to a series of frontier
  examinations, to tariff payments, to elaborate delays, to such petty but
  memorable vexations as that all the windows of an express train passing
  across the Corridor should be closed, and so forth, and the city of Danzig,
  cut off from German trade, found its Polish business being steadily diverted
  to Gdynia. French capital was poured into Gdynia and into its new railway to
  the south, so that French financial interests were speedily entangled in the
  dispute.</p>

  <p>The indignity and menace of Danzig burnt into the German imagination. That
  Corridor fretted it as nothing else in the peace settlement had fretted it.
  It became a dominant political issue. There was an open sore of a similar
  character in Upper Silesia; there was a sore in the Saar Valley; there was
  the sore of an enforced detachment from Austria; there were many other bitter
  memories and grievances, but this was so intimate, so close to Berlin, that
  it obsessed all German life.</p>

  <p>Within a dozen years of the signing of the Treaty of Versailles the Polish
  Corridor was plainly the most dangerous factor in the European situation. It
  mocked every projection of disarmament. It pointed the hypnotized and
  impotent statescraft of Europe straight towards a resumption of war. A
  fatalistic attitude towards war as something terrible indeed but inevitable,
  which had already been evident among the politicians of Europe before 1914,
  reappeared and spread.</p>

  <p>History had an air of repeating itself. Nobody made any definite
  suggestions about any of these open sores, but there was scarcely a
  politician of the period who could not claim to have been very eloquent on
  various occasions against war&mdash;with, of course, a skilful avoidance of
  anything that could be considered specific, controversial, unpatriotic or
  likely to wound the susceptibilities of the Powers immediately concerned.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap1_11"
     name="chap1_11">11. &mdash; THE IMPULSE TO ABOLISH WAR:<br>
  WHY THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS<br>
  FAILED TO PACIFY THE WORLD</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Before we leave that bleak and futile idealist, Woodrow
  Wilson, altogether, we will draw the attention of the student to the
  essential factors of his failure. The defects of his personality must not
  blind us to the impossibility of his ambition. His narrow egotism, the
  punitive treatment of the Central Powers and so forth, merely emphasized a
  disadvantage that would have been fatal to the launching of any League of
  Nations at that time. There had been an insufficient mental preparation for a
  world system to operate. No ideology existed to sustain it. The World-State,
  the Modern State, was still only a vaguely apprehended suggestion; it had not
  been worked out with any thoroughness and the League was the most hasty of
  improvisations.</p>

  <p>It needed the life scheming of de Windt and his associates, which we shall
  presently describe; it needed a huge development and application of the
  science of social psychology, before the supersession of the chaos of
  sovereign states by a central control was even a remote possibility. Wilson
  thought he could get together with a few congenial spirits and write a recipe
  for human unity. He had not the slightest inkling of the gigantic
  proportions, the intricacy, intimacy and profundity, of the task that was
  opening before him. He attempted to patch up the outworn system of his time
  and pass it off as a new one. He did not dream of the monetary
  reconstruction, the need for a thorough-going socialism throughout the world,
  and for a complete revolution in education, before the peace and security of
  mankind could be established. Yet, narrow and blind as he was, he seems to
  have been in advance of the general thought of his age.</p>

  <p>This premature and ineffectual League was a hindrance rather than a help
  to the achievement of world peace. It got in the way. It prevented people
  from thinking freely about the essentials of the problem. Organizations of
  well-meaning folk, the British League of Nations Union, for example, came
  into existence to support it, and resisted rather than helped any effectual
  criticism of its constitution and working. They would say that it was "better
  than nothing", whereas a false start is very much worse than nothing. In the
  post-war decade, the amount of vigorous constructive thought in the general
  mind about world politics was extraordinarily small. It was only when the
  insufficiency of the League had passed beyond any possibility of dispute that
  men began to take up the abandoned search for world unification again.</p>

  <p>A dozen years later the Modern State movement was still only foreshadowed
  in sketchy attempts to find a comprehensive set of general formulae for
  liberal progressive effort. The pacificists, communists, socialists and every
  other sort of "ists" who gave a partial and confused expression to human
  discontent had still to be drawn together into understanding and cooperation.
  Most of their energy was wasted in obscure bickerings, mutual suspicion and
  petty and partial tentatives. The middle of the century had been passed
  before there was any considerable body of Modern State propaganda and
  education on earth.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap1_12"
     name="chap1_12">12. &mdash; THE BREAKDOWN OF "FINANCE"<br>
  AND SOCIAL MORALE AFTER VERSAILLES</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The unprecedented range and destruction of the World War
  were, we have pointed out, largely ascribable to the hypertrophy of the
  world's iron and steel industry relatively to the political and social
  concepts of the race. But in the first "post-war" decade the stresses of
  other disproportionate developments began to make themselves manifest at
  various other weak points in the loosely linked association of our species.
  The war from the economic point of view had been the convulsive using up of
  an excess of production that the race had no other method of distributing and
  consuming. But the necessities of the struggle, and particularly its
  interference with international trading, which had evoked factories and
  finishing processes in many undeveloped regions hitherto yielding only raw or
  unfinished materials, had added greatly to the gross bulk of productive plant
  throughout the world, and so soon as the open war-furnaces ceased to burn up
  the surplus and hold millions of men out of the labour market, this fact
  became more and more oppressively apparent. The postwar increase in war
  preparation, which went on in spite of endless palavering about disarmament,
  did not destroy men, nor scrap and destroy material, in sufficient quantity
  to relieve the situation.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the expansion of productive energy was being accompanied by a
  positive contraction of the distributive arrangements which determined
  consumption. The more efficient the output, the fewer were the wages-earners.
  The more stuff there was, the fewer consumers there were. The fewer the
  consumers, the smaller the trading profits, and the less the gross spending
  power of the shareholders and individual entrepreneurs. So buying dwindled at
  both ends of the process and the common investor suffered with the wages-
  earner. This was the "Paradox of Overproduction" which so troubled the
  writers and journalists of the third decade of the twentieth century.</p>

  <p>It is easy for the young student to-day to ask "Why did they not adjust?"
  But let him ask himself who there was to adjust. Our modern superstructure of
  applied economic science, the David Lubin Bureau and the General Directors'
  Board, with its vast recording organization, its hundreds of thousands of
  stations and observers, directing, adjusting, apportioning and distributing,
  had not even begun to exist. Adjustment was left to blind and ill-estimated
  forces. It was the general interest of mankind to be prosperous, but it was
  nobody's particular interest to keep affairs in a frame of prosperity.
  Manifestly a dramatic revision of the liberties of enterprise was necessary,
  but the enterprising people who controlled politics, so far as political life
  was controlled, were the very last people to undertake such a revision.</p>

  <p>With the hypertrophy of productive activities there had been a concurrent
  hypertrophy of banking and financial organization generally, but it had been
  a flabby hypertrophy, a result of the expansion of material production rather
  than a compensatory and controlling development.</p>

  <p>It is so plain to us to-day that the apportionment of the general product
  of the world for enterprise or consumption is a department of social justice
  and policy, and can be dealt with only in the full light of public criticism
  and upon grounds of claim and need, that it is difficult for us to understand
  the twentieth century attitude to these things. We should no more dream of
  leaving the effectual control in these matters in private profit-seeking
  hands than we should leave our law courts or our schools to the private
  bidder. But nothing of the sort was plain in 1935 C.E. That lesson had still
  to be learnt.</p>

  <p>The story of banking and money in the early twentieth century has so much
  in it verging upon the incredible, that it has become one of the most
  attractive and fruitful fields for the student of historical psychology. The
  system had grown up as a tangle of practice. It was evolved, not designed.
  There was never any attempt to gauge the justice or the ultimate consequences
  of any practice, so long as it worked at the time. Men tried this and that,
  did this and that, and concealed their opinions of what the results might be.
  Reserve was essential in the system. So little was the need for publicity in
  this universal interest understood, that the most fundamental decisions
  affecting the common man's purchasing power and the credit of industrial
  undertakings were made in secret, and the restriction and stimulation of
  trade and work went on in the profoundest obscurity. Neither in the ordinary
  courses of the schools and universities was there any instruction in these
  essential facts. The right of private enterprise to privacy was respected in
  the Churches, the law courts and private practice alike. Men found themselves
  employed or unemployed, cheated of their savings or better off, they knew not
  why. Instead of the clear knowledge of economic pressures and movements that
  we have to-day, strange Mystery Men were dimly visible through a fog of
  baffling evasions and mis-statements, manipulating prices and exchanges.</p>

  <p>Prominent among these Mystery Men was a certain Mr. Montagu Norman,
  Governor of the Bank of England from 1920 to 1935. He is among the least
  credible figures in all history, and a great incrustation of legends has
  accumulated about him. In truth the only mystery about him was that he was
  mysterious. His portrait shows a slender, bearded man, dressed more like a
  successful artist or musician than the conventional banker of the time. He
  was reputed to be shy and, in the phraseology of the time, "charming", and he
  excited the popular imagination by a habit of travelling about under assumed
  names and turning up in unexpected places. Why he did so, nobody now knows.
  Perhaps he did it for the fun of doing it. He gave evidence before an enquiry
  into finance in 1930 (the Macmillan Committee), and from that and from one or
  two of his public speeches that have been preserved, it is plain that he had
  what we should now consider an entirely inadequate education for the veiled
  activities in which he was engaged. Of human ecology he betrays no knowledge,
  and his ideas of social and economic processes are not what we should now
  recognize as adequate general ideas even for an ordinary citizen. Indeed his
  chief qualification for his darkly responsible post was some practical
  experience acquired in association with various private banking firms before
  he entered the service of the Bank of England. This experience was acquired
  during what we know now to have been a period of quite accidental and
  transitory expansion of human wealth. Plainly he did not even bring a blank
  mind to his task. He had a mind warped and prejudiced by gainful banking
  under abnormal conditions. Yet for a time he was regarded as an "expert" of
  almost magical quality, and during the convulsions of the post-war period he
  was able to dictate or defeat arrangements that enriched or impoverished
  millions of people in every country in Europe.</p>

  <p>Another big obscure financial force in the war and post-war periods was
  the complex of great private banking ganglia, of which Morgan and Co., with
  its associated firms, was the most central and most typical. This particular
  firm carried on its business upon a scale that completely overshadowed many
  minor governments. The loans it made or refused, confirmed or shattered
  régimes. Its founder, J. P. Morgan, a queer combination of Yankee "gentleman"
  and German junker, whose innate acquisitiveness overflowed in great
  collections of pictures and "art" objects generally, had died before the
  outbreak of the war, but a phrase he used in a dispute with President
  Roosevelt the First was taken up later and made into a deadly critical weapon
  against the whole private banking world. "Roosevelt", he protested, "wants
  all of us to have glass pockets!"</p>

  <p>A second President Roosevelt was presently to revive that demand.</p>

  <p>Nothing could better betray the habit of deep gainful manoeuvrings than
  that phrase. Morgan was never dishonest and always disingenuous. That was the
  rule of his game. Opaque pockets he insisted upon, and hidden motives, but
  also the punctual performance of a bargain. His tradition lived after him.
  His firm became an octopus of credit. The interweaving bargains it made hung
  like a shadowy group of spiders' webs about European life. It did its work of
  strangulation by its nature and without malice, as a spider spins. No
  contemporary could apprehend it. The particulars of any particular situation
  could only be unravelled vaguely by a normal enquirer after many months of
  study.</p>

  <p>Interacting with such mystery systems as these of the banking world were
  other dark figures and groups, controlling vast industrial activities,
  obsessing and perverting spending power. There was, for example, that Mystery
  Man of Mystery Men, Sir Basil Zaharoff, the armaments salesman, still the
  delight of our schoolboy novelists, and Ivar Kreuger, who created an almost
  world-wide system of lucifer match monopolies, lent great sums to governments
  and was finally caught forging big parcels of bonds. He then staged a suicide
  in Paris to escape the penalty of fraud. (We have to remember that in those
  days the lucifer matches we now see in museums were consumed by the billion.
  There was no other handy source of fire, and their manufacture and
  distribution was on the scale of a primary industry.) Kreuger, unlike Morgan,
  was not a man of the acquisitive type; he neither hoarded nor collected; he
  kept nothing, not even the law, but he built lavishly and gave away money for
  scientific research. (The discovery of Pekin Man, a memorable incident in
  early archaeology, was, for instance, made possible by his gifts.) Morgan
  forestalled and accumulated; Kreuger robbed and gave. When Morgan spent his
  gains he bought "Old Masters", manuscripts and suchlike indisputably genuine
  and valuable junk; when Kreuger dispersed the moneys that had been entrusted
  to him he made the most extraordinary experiments in decorative art, in
  electric lighting and fantastic building. But each operated unchecked. So
  obscure was the financial machinery of the time that for some months Kreuger
  was able to pass off as genuine a package of forged Italian bonds amounting
  to about half a million dollars, and to obtain advances upon them from
  reputable lenders. To-day a trick of such a character would be detected, were
  it possible, in the course of a single day by the ordinary checking of the
  Transactions Bureau. But nowadays no one would have any reason for attempting
  anything of the sort. The lives of these Mystery Men and of the various
  groups of speculators (the Balkan Gang, e.g.) who manipulated the exchanges
  of the various national currencies of Eastern Europe, and of a great number
  of other profit-seeking groups and individuals who were thrusting about
  amidst the machinery of exchange, are to be found in the Lives of Mischief
  (Financial Volumes) taken out of the Dictionary of Biography. The very best
  of them were men who waylaid gain or sought adventures in a fog. Most of them
  were as active and as blind to the consequences of their activities as moles
  who perforate a dyke.</p>

  <p>In the files of the financial papers of this period, when the movements of
  gold were of vital significance to the prices of commodities and the credit
  of everyone in the world, one sees such headings as "Unknown Buyer Takes Two
  Millions in Gold" or, less exactly, "Gold Bought by Unknown Buyer". Then all
  the little manipulators of money would be set peering and spying and guessing
  and rigging their business to the possible shift of equilibrium this dark
  intimation might portend.</p>

  <p>Other Mystery Men, Mystery Men ex officio, were the various Ministers of
  Finance, of whom perhaps the British Chancellor of the Exchequer was most
  typical. Every year there was a vast amount of whispering and hinting,
  peeping and calculating and going to and fro, about the National Budget and
  the readjustment of taxation for another twelvemonth. An arithmetical mystery
  called "balancing the Budget" had to be performed. Business would be held up
  as the great revelation drew near; gambling operations, insurance operations,
  would multiply. The wife, the family, the intimates and secretaries of the
  Man of Destiny, went about the world sealed, enigmatical, oracular,
  profoundly important with his reflected importance. At last the great day
  dawned. The legislature would assemble in unusual force, excited and curious.
  The Witch Doctor, with his portfolios of Obi, would take his place in the
  House of Commons, rise portentously, begin the "Budget Speech".</p>

  <p>No Budget Speech was complete without its "surprises". Could anything
  witness more vividly to the chaotic casualness of the twentieth century?
  Anything might be taxed; anything might be relieved; anyone might shift the
  weights about. In the economic darkness of the time it did not seem to
  matter. The marvel is that the system staggered on for so long.</p>

  <p>How amazing, how fantastic, was that condition of affairs! It is as if one
  of the great transatlantic liners of the period had careered across the ocean
  with its passenger decks and cabins brightly lit, its saloons and bars in
  full swing, while down below, its essential machinery, manifestly with
  something going wrong with it, had no arrangements for illumination at all
  and was served by men (some of them masked), working without a foreman or any
  general directions, by the light of an occasional match or a treasured but
  rather worn-out electric torch, or altogether in the dark, upon the great
  cranks and swiftly sliding shafts that beat and circled about them.</p>

  <p>From the very cessation of the fighting in 1918 and onward it was manifest
  that this machinery was seriously out of gear. The economic history of the
  time is a story of swerves and fluctuations of the most alarming kind, each
  one more disconcerting and disastrous than its predecessor. In the decades
  before the war, though there were certainly variations in the real value of
  the different currencies, they were variations within moderate limits, and
  the rise or fall went on through comparatively long periods, but after the
  war there commenced a series of movements in exchange and prices
  unprecedented throughout the whole period of prosperity. Currencies rose and
  towered above others and broke like Atlantic waves, and people found the good
  money in their banks changed to useless paper in a period of a few months. It
  became more and more difficult to carry on foreign trade because of the
  increasing uncertainty of payment, and since there was scarcely a
  manufacturing industry that had not to obtain some material from abroad, the
  entanglement of foreign trade often involved a strangulation of production at
  home. Trade and industry sickened and lost heart more and more in this
  disastrous uncertainty; it was like being in an earthquake, when it seems
  equally unsafe to stand still or run away; and the multitudes of unemployed
  increased continually. The economically combatant nations entrenched
  themselves behind tariffs, played each other tricks with loans, repudiations,
  sudden inflations and deflations, and no power in the world seemed able to
  bring them into any concerted action to arrest and stop their common
  dégringolade.</p>

  <p>The opening years of the second third of the twentieth century saw Homo
  sapiens in the strangest plight. The planet had a healthier and more abundant
  human population than it had ever carried before, and it lacked nothing in
  its available resources to give the whole of this population full and happy
  lives. That was already the material reality of the position. But through
  nothing in the world but a universal, various muddle-headedness, our species
  seemed unable to put out its hand and take the abundance within its reach. As
  we turn over the periodicals and literature of the time the notes of
  apprehension and distress increase and deepen. The war period of 1914-1918
  was full of suffering, but also it was full of excitement; even the dying on
  the battlefields believed that a compensatory peace and happiness lay close
  ahead. The survivors were promised "homes fit for heroes." But the Depression
  of 1930 and onward was characterized by its inelasticity; it was a phase of
  unqualified disappointment and hopelessly baffled protest. One lived, as one
  contemporary writer put it, "in a world bewitched".</p>

  <p>The economic consequences of this monetary disorganization followed hard
  upon it, but the deeper-lying destruction of social morale and its effects
  were manifested less immediately. The whole world system heretofore had been
  sustained by the general good behavior of common men, by the honesty and
  punctuality of clerks, workers of every sort, traders, professional men.
  General security depended upon habitual decent behaviour in the street and on
  the countryside. But the common man behaved well because he had faith that
  his pay was a safe, if sometimes a scanty, assurance of a certain comfort and
  dignity in his life. He imagined an implicit bargain between himself and
  society that he should be given employment and security in exchange for his
  law-abiding subordination, and that society would keep faith with his
  savings. He assumed that the governments would stand by the money they issued
  and see that it gave him the satisfactions it promised him. He was not a good
  boy for nothing. Nobody is. But now in various terms and phrases all over the
  world millions of men and women were asking themselves whether it "paid" to
  be industrious, skilful and law-abiding. The cement of confidence in the
  social fabric from 1918 onward was more and more plainly decaying and
  changing to dust. The percentage of criminal offences, which had been falling
  through all the period of prosperity, rose again.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap1_13"
     name="chap1_13">13. &mdash; 1933: "PROGRESS" COMES TO A HALT</a></h2>

  <p class="first">So we bring the history of mankind to that great pause in
  social expansion which concluded the first third of the twentieth century.
  The year 1933 closed in a phase of dismayed apprehension. It was like that
  chilly stillness, that wordless interval of suspense, that comes at times
  before the breaking of a storm. The wheels of economic life were turning only
  reluctantly and uncertainly; the millions of unemployed accumulated and
  became more and more plainly a challenge and a menace. All over the world the
  masses were sinking down through distress and insufficiency to actual famine.
  And collectively they were doing nothing effectual in protest or struggle.
  Insurrectionary socialism lurked and muttered in every great agglomeration.
  But insurrection alone could remedy nothing without constructive ideas, and
  there was no power and energy yet behind any such constructive ideas as had
  appeared. The merely repressive forces, whatever their feebleness in the face
  of criminality, were still fully capable of restraining popular insurrection.
  They could keep misery stagnant and inoperative.</p>

  <p>Everywhere, in everything, there was an ebb of vitality. A decline in the
  public health was becoming perceptible. A diminishing resistance to
  infections and a rise in the infantile death-rate was already very evident in
  the vital statistics after 1933.</p>

  <p>War was manifestly drawing nearer, in Eastern Asia, in Eastern Europe; it
  loitered, it advanced, it halted, and no one displayed the vigour or capacity
  needed to avert its intermittent, unhurrying approach.</p>

  <p>Still the immense inertias of the old order carried things on. Under a
  darkling sky, the majority of people were going about their business
  according to use and wont. The unprofitable industries still carried on with
  reduced staffs; the shopkeepers opened their shops to a dwindling tale of
  customers; the unemployed queued up at the Labour Exchanges by force of
  habit, and some at least got a job; the landlord's agent no longer collected
  the rent that was due but called for an instalment of his arrears; the unfed
  or ill-fed children went sniffing to chilly schools to be taught by
  dispirited teachers on reduced salaries, but still the schools were not
  closed; the bankrupt railways and steamship lines ran diminished but punctual
  services; hotels stayed open not to make profits but to mitigate losses; the
  road traffic lost something of its newness and smartness and swiftness, but
  still it flowed; the crowds in the streets moved less briskly, but, if
  anything, these sluggish crowds were more numerous, and the police, if less
  alertly vigilant, maintained order.</p>

  <p>There had been a considerable if inadequate building boom after the Peace
  of Versailles, but after 1930 new construction fell off more and more. Yet
  some builders found work, necessary repairs were attended to, burnt-out
  houses were reconditioned, for example. In 1935 and 1937 the world was swept
  by influenza epidemics of unusual virulence. The lowered resistance, already
  noted by the statisticians, was now made conspicuous by this return towards
  mediaeval conditions; but the doctors and nurses stuck to their duties
  stoutly and the druggists and undertakers, whose affairs had long since been
  reorganized on Big Business lines, profited.</p>

  <p>Pictures of life in the shadows during this phase of devitalization are
  not very abundant, nor do they convey the essential misery into which a whole
  generation was born, in which it lived and died. One sees the rows of
  dilapidated houses, the wretched interiors and shabbily clad men and women
  standing about. In these pictures they seem always to be just standing about.
  Descriptive journalism brings the student nearer to the realities of a life
  without space, colour, movement, hope or opportunity. There were a number of
  "enquiries" made, more particularly by the British, American and French
  newspapers, and the tale they tell is always a tale of wheels slowing down to
  a stoppage, of factory gates being closed, of smokeless chimneys and rusting
  rails. Here is a vivid contemporary vignette, to show how things were with
  millions of human beings during this strange phase of human experience. It is
  from the pen of H. M. Tomlinson (1873-1969) one of the best of English
  descriptive writers.</p>

  <p>"I chanced upon a little town above Cardiff last week. It was by pure
  chance; I had never before heard of the place. It is typical of these
  valleys, so never mind its name. It could have many names. Its population is,
  or was, about 6,000. Its people have faced trouble before&mdash;less than
  twenty years ago over 300 of its men perished in a mine explosion. We won't
  say the town got over that, for I spoke to those for whom the calamity is an
  abiding horror. It was a terrific defeat for them in the war upon Nature, but
  survivors returned to the struggle and said no more about it.</p>

  <p>"When first I saw the town from a distance, with the bleak, bare uplands
  about it, I was reminded of the towns, once familiar, that were too near the
  battleline in France. It was midday, and sunny, yet this colliery town was
  silent and so still that it seemed under a spell.</p>

  <p>"As a fact it IS under a spell. It is, in a way, dead. But its people
  cling to the empty shell of it. Where else can they go?</p>

  <p>"At first sight no people could have been there. Buildings in the
  foreground were in ruins. The gaunt pit-head gearing evidently had not moved
  for an age. The gaps in the blackened walls of the power-house suggested a
  home of bats and owls.</p>

  <p>"The first man I met when I reached the end of its main street and saw
  then that the shops were not only closed, but abandoned, was standing on the
  kerb, a man in the middle years, shrewd, but haggard, his clothes brushed
  till they were threadbare.</p>

  <p>"'What's the matter with this town?' I asked.</p>

  <p>"'On the dole.'</p>

  <p>"'Are you out too?'</p>

  <p>"'Of course I'm out.'</p>

  <p>"'How long?'</p>

  <p>"He was silent. He held up five fingers.</p>

  <p>"'Months?'</p>

  <p>"'Years.'</p>

  <p>"'Are all the men here the same?'</p>

  <p>"'Most of them. And won't go back.'</p>

  <p>"He led me up a mound of refuse, where a goat was eating paper, and we had
  a near view of the colliery itself. 'That's the reason we won't go down
  again,' he said. 'How would you work it?'</p>

  <p>"Whether by design or rust a steel footbridge had fallen across the wide
  railway track which went to the pit-head. A deflected stream guttered down
  between the metals, which were overgrown with grass and stagnant marsh stuff.
  The outbuildings were a huddle of dilapidations. It looked haunted. 'Some men
  I knew,' muttered my guide, 'are still down there. There they'll stop.
  They've been there nineteen years now. Would you call them lucky?'</p>

  <p>"Two thousand five hundred men came out of the principal colliery five
  years ago. That is why the shops are shut, long rows of them with whitewashed
  windows and doorways filled with dust and straws. The woodwork of many houses
  has been taken for firewood. Even the Cooperative store is shut, as well as
  the pawnshop. Thrift and thriftlessness mean the same thing in this town,
  where I noticed that even Nonconformist chapels, with broken windows, had
  been left to the rats and birds.</p>

  <p>"Worse than the dismal shops and broken buildings are the groups of shabby
  men, all neat and tidy, standing listless and silent at the street corners,
  waiting.</p>

  <p>"Waiting for what? Nothing. There is nothing to come....</p>

  <p>"They are doomed, these parents, to watch a generation grow up with thin
  bones and a shadow on its mind. Their children learn the signs of the slow
  death about them when they should be at play; children that have no
  childhood.</p>

  <p>"Their homes are in a graveyard of human aspiration...."</p>

  <p>The Press and literature of that period make curious reading. It varied
  between a bleak insincere optimism and hopeless desperation. An undignified
  viciousness and a jeering humour invaded popular art and literature; "strong"
  in manner and in flavour rather than in any grasp upon the realities of
  contemporary life. There was also an abundant production and consumption of
  reassuring and deliberately "cheerful" books, a movement towards religious
  mysticism and other-worldliness and a marked tendency towards repressive
  puritanism. Excesses of libertinism provoke censorious and superstitious
  suppression; the two things are correlated aspects of a decline in human
  dignity. In the face of its financial and political perplexities mankind was
  becoming neurasthenic.</p>

  <p>All neurasthenia has apparently unaccountable elements. To us to-day, it
  seems incredible that the way out of all these distresses was not plainly
  seen and boldly taken. There was a blindness and an effortlessness that still
  exercise the mind of the social psychologist. The way was so plain that it
  was visible, it was indicated by hundreds of intelligent and detached
  observers as early as the thirties of the twentieth century. Maxwell Brown,
  in his study of the Modern State idea, has two supplementary volumes of
  citations to this effect. Such phrases, for example, as "Cosmopolis,
  Inflation and Public Employment" (from a British provincial newspaper article
  in 1932) do state, in general terms at any rate, the line of escape for the
  race. These are crude, ill-defined terms, but manifestly they have in them
  the shape of the ultimate reconstruction. "Cosmopolis" foreshadows our
  rational world controls, "Inflation" was a plain indication of our present
  complete restraint upon the aggravation of debts and fluctuations of price
  level; "Public Employment" was our ancestors' conception of socialist
  enterprise.</p>

  <p>But before the exodus to peace and freedom could be achieved, such
  scattered flashes of understanding had to ignite a steadier illumination. The
  conception of revolutionary world reconstruction had to spread from the few
  to the many, spread to them not merely as an idea and as a suggestion, but in
  such force as to saturate their minds and determine their lives. Then, and
  then only, could the necessary will-power be marshalled and directed to the
  effective reorganization of earthly affairs.</p>

  <p>A struggle for sanity had to take place in the racial brain, a great
  casting-out of false assumptions, conventional distortions, hitherto
  uncriticized maxims and impossible "rights," a great clearing-up of ideas
  about moral, material and biological relationships; it was a struggle that,
  as we shall see, involved the passing of three generations. To an analysis of
  the factors and decisive forces in this struggle our history must next
  address itself.</p>

  <p>Something between eight and ten thousand million human lives in all were
  lived out during the Age of Frustration. Compared with the average lives of
  to-day, they were shorter and far less healthy; nearly all of them had long
  phases of such infection, maladjustment and enfeeblement as are now almost
  outside man's experience. The great majority of them were passed laboriously
  in squalid or dingy surroundings, in huts, hovels, cottages, tenements and
  cellars almost as dismal as the ancestral cave and nearly as insanitary. A
  minority who could command the services of "domestics" lived in relative
  comfort and even with a certain freedom and luxury, at an enormous cost to
  the rest. This prosperous minority dwindled after 1931. It had vanished in
  Russia after 1917.</p>

  <p>There was a diminishing sense of personal security in the world, an
  enervating fear and uncertainty about the morrow, through the ensuing years.
  There was what we find now an almost incredible amount of mutual distrust,
  suspicion, irritation and quarrelling. Only a small proportion of the world's
  population lived to be peacefully and gracefully old in this phase of
  deterioration. Disease or a violent death became the common end again. One of
  the first general histories that was ever written was called The Martyrdom of
  Man (Winwood Reade, 1871). In the Age of Frustration it seemed to many that
  that martyrdom was mounting to a final hopeless agony.</p>

  <p>Yet in the welter there were also laughter, sympathy, helpfulness and
  courage. Those fretted and painful lives interwove with threads of great
  brightness. Out of that medley of human distresses, out of the brains of men
  stressed out of indolence and complacency by the gathering darkness and
  suffering about them, there came first the hope, then the broad plan and the
  effort, and at last the achievement of that fruitful order, gathering beauty
  and happy assurance, in which we live to-day.</p><br>

     name="chap2_01">1. &mdash; THE LONDON CONFERENCE:<br>
  THE CROWNING FAILURE OF THE OLD GOVERNMENTS;<br>
  THE SPREAD OF DICTATORSHIPS AND FASCISMS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">In the preceding chapters we have explained how the old
  order of the nineteenth century, the Capitalist System as it was called, came
  to disaster in the second and third decades of the twentieth century because
  of the disproportionate development of its industrial production, the
  unsoundness and vulnerability of its monetary nexus, and its political
  inadaptability. It had no inherent power of recovery, and there was no idea
  of a new order, sufficiently developed, to replace it. Necessarily therefore
  the tale of disaster went on.</p>

  <p>The only mechanisms in existence for collective action, and that only in
  disconnected spurts, were the various sovereign governments. Most of these at
  the outset of the war were either parliamentary monarchies or parliamentary
  republics. The parliaments were elected upon a very preposterous system by
  the bulk or all of the population. The age was called the Age of Democracy.
  Democracy did not mean then what it means now, an equal opportunity for every
  human being according to his ability and the faculty to which he belongs, to
  serve and have a voice in collective affairs. Nor did it mean the fraternal
  equality of a small community. It expressed a political fiction of a very
  extraordinary kind: that every subject of the contemporary state was equally
  capable of making whatever collective decisions had to be made.</p>

  <p>The great republics of a remoter antiquity, the Carthaginian, the
  Athenian, the Roman, for example, were all essentially aristocratic.
  Democratic republics, that is to say republics in which every man was
  supposed to share equally in the government, in the rare instances when they
  occurred at all before the end of the eighteenth century, were, like, Uri,
  Unterwalden or Andorra, small and poor and perched in inaccessible places.
  The world at large knew nothing of them. Their affairs were equally small and
  well within the scope of a common citizen's understanding.</p>

  <p>Then with the Era of European Predominance came a turning-point in human
  affairs, that outbreak of books and discussion in the fifteenth century, a
  period of great animation and confusion when the destructive criticism of
  faiths and loyalties got loose. The release of new economic forces strained
  the old feudal order to breaking. Exploration and merchandising, new
  financial conditions, industrial development, created new types of men,
  uncertain of their powers, needing and demanding free play. They did not know
  clearly what they wanted; they did not know clearly how they differed from
  the men of the old order, nor had they any conception that such a structural
  reform of human relations as Plato had already pictured nearly two thousand
  years before them. His plan for a devoted and trained order of rulers was
  unknown to them, though More had tried to revive it. They were simply
  responding to the facts about them. They chafed under an hereditary
  aristocracy, and they distrusted an absolute king.</p>

  <p>Essentially the movement that evolved the phraseology of nineteenth-
  century democracy was a revolt against "birth" and "privilege", against the
  monopolization of direction and advantages by restricted and generally
  hereditary classes in accordance with definitely established dogmas. Because
  this revolt was the revolt of a very miscellaneous number of energetic and
  resentful individuals not definitely organized, mentally or socially, it came
  about that at a quite early stage of the new movement it took the form of an
  assertion of the equal political rights of all men.</p>

  <p>It was not that these sixteenth and seventeenth-century Radicals were for
  government by the general mass; it was that they were antagonistic to
  established classes and rulers. They constituted a vigorous insurgent
  minority rousing, so far as it could, and trailing after it the apathetic
  majority of submissive mankind. That was always the character of these
  democratic movements of the Age of European Predominance. The multitude was
  supposed to be demanding and deciding&mdash;and all the time it was being
  pushed or led. The individuality of the popular "leaders" of those centuries
  stands out far more vividly than the kings and ecclesiastics of the period.
  Only one or two such hereditary monarchs as William Prince of Orange, or
  Frederick the Great of Prussia, figure as conspicuously on the record
  as&mdash;to cite a miscellany of new types&mdash; Cromwell, Voltaire,
  Mirabeau, Washington, Gladstone, Robespierre, Bonaparte or Marx.</p>

  <p>Later on (in England, America, Scandinavia, Germany, Finland, e.g.) in
  just the same way a minority of dissatisfied and aggressive women struggling
  for a rôle in affairs inflicted the vote upon the indifferent majority of
  women. But their achievement ended with that. Outside that sexual
  vindication, women at that time had little to contribute to the solution of
  the world's problems, and as a matter of fact they contributed nothing.</p>

  <p>Research in social psychology is still only beginning to unravel the
  obscure processes by which faith in "democracy" became for the better part of
  a century the ruling cant of practically all America and the greater part of
  Europe. There was often a profound internal disingenuousness even in those
  who were known as "Thinkers" in that age. They were afraid in their hearts of
  stark realities; they tried instinctively to adapt even their heresies to
  what seemed to them invincibly established prejudices. Their primary
  conception of democracy was of some far-away simple little republic of stout
  upstanding men, all similar, all practically equal in fortune and power,
  managing the affairs of the canton in a folk-meeting, by frank speech and
  acclamation. All the old-world democracies, up to and including the Republic
  of Rome, were ruled, in theory at least, by such meetings of all the
  citizens. The people, it was imagined, watched, listened, spoke, and wisdom
  ensued.</p>

  <p>The extension of this ideal to the large communities of the new world that
  was replacing the feudal order, involved such manifest difficulties and even
  such absurdities that mysticism was inevitable if the people was still to be
  supposed the sovereign of the community. But there was so strong and
  widespread a dread that if this supposition was not maintained privilege,
  restriction, tyranny would come back that the mystical interpretation was
  boldly adopted. At any cost those old inequalities must not return, said the
  adventurers of the dawning capitalist age, and, flying from one subjugation,
  they hurried on to another.</p>

  <p>They found the doctrine of man's natural virtue as expounded by Rousseau
  extraordinarily helpful and effective. The common man, when he is not
  beguiled by Priest or King, is always right. The Common People became
  therefore a mystical sympathetic being, essentially a God, whose altar was
  the hustings and whose oracle the ballot box. A little slow and lumpish was
  this God of the Age of European Predominance, but, though his mills ground
  slowly, men were assured that they ground with ultimate exactitude. And
  meanwhile business could be carried on. You could fool some of the people all
  the time and all the people some of the time, said Abraham Lincoln, but you
  could not fool all the people all the time. Yet for such crucial purposes as
  bringing about a war or exploiting an economic situation, this was manifestly
  a quite disastrous degree of foolability.</p>

  <p>And the situation naturally evolved a Press of the very highest fooling
  capacity.</p>

  <p>This belatedly inevitable Divinity proved now to be altogether too slow-
  witted for the urgent political and economic riddles, with ruin and death at
  hand, which pressed upon our race as the twentieth century unfolded. The
  experience of the futile Disarmament and Economic Conferences of 1932 and
  1933, the massive resistance in every national legislature to any but the
  most narrow egotism in foreign policy, the inability of the world as a whole
  to establish any unanimity of action in face of swift economic collapse,
  revealed the final bankruptcy of Parliamentary Democracy.</p>

  <p>The inability of the world's nominal rulers to shake off their lifelong
  habit of speaking to, or at, a vaguely conceived crowd of prejudiced voters,
  and their invincible repugnance from clear statement, frustrated every effort
  towards realism. They recoiled from any suggestion of definitive or novel
  action on the plea that their function was purely representative. Behind them
  all the reader feels the sprawling uneasy presence of that poor invertebrate
  mass deity of theirs, the Voter, easily roused to panic and frantic action
  against novel, bold or radical measures, very amenable to patriotic claptrap,
  very easily scared and maddened into war, and just as easily baffled to
  distrust and impotence by delays, side issues, and attacks on the
  personalities of decisive people he might otherwise have trusted. An entirely
  irresponsible Press, mercenary or partisan, played upon his baser emotions,
  which were so easy to play upon, and made no appeal whatever to his
  intelligence or his conscience.</p>

  <p>The Voter, the Mass, which was neither educated nor led, the Voter without
  any sincere organizations of leadership anywhere, is the basal explanation of
  the impotence of those culminating conferences. The World Economic Conference
  in London was by far the more significant of the two. Armament and
  disarmament are symptoms and superficial, but economic life is fundamental.
  This London gathering has been made the subject of a thousand studies by our
  social psychologists. Many of its contradictions still perplex us profoundly.
  The men who assembled had just as good brains as anyone to-day, and, as an
  exhaustive analysis by Moreton Canby of the various projects advanced at the
  Conference proves, they had a substantial understanding of the needs of the
  world situation, yet collectively, and because of their haunting paralysing
  sense of the Mass and Press behind them and of their incalculable impulses
  and resentments, they achieved an effect of fatuity far beyond the pompous
  blunderings of Versailles.</p>

  <p>Primarily the London Conference was a belated effort to repair the vast
  omissions of that earlier gathering, to supplement the well-meaning political
  patchwork of Wilson by some readjustment of the monetary and economic
  dislocations he had been too limited to foresee or too weak to avoid.
  Wraithlike conceptions of some vague monetary League of Nations at Bâle, and
  some Tariff Council and Assembly, drifted through the mists of the opening
  meeting. And History, with its disposition to inexact repetition made one of
  the principal figures of this second world assembly also a President of the
  United States, belonging also to the Democratic Party and according to the
  ritual of that Party invoking the name of Jefferson as the Communists invoked
  the name of Marx or the Moslim, Mahomet. This was Roosevelt II. He leaves a
  less vivid impression than his predecessor because he did not impend for so
  long upon the European scene. But for some months at least before and after
  his election as American President and the holding of the London Conference
  there was again a whispering hope in the world that a real "Man" had arisen,
  who would see simply and clearly, who would speak plainly to all mankind and
  liberate the world from the dire obsessions and ineptitudes under which it
  suffered and to which it seemed magically enslaved. But the one thing he
  failed to do was to speak plainly.</p>

  <p>Drawing wisdom from Wilson's personal failure, he did not come to London
  and expose himself and his conversation to too close a scrutiny. He preferred
  to deal with the fluctuating crises in London from his yacht, Amberjack II,
  in Nantucket Harbour, through intermittent messages and through more or less
  completely authorized intermediaries. Amberjack II has become almost as
  significant a ship in the history of human affairs as the Ford Peace Ship.
  Significant equally in its intentions and in its inadequacies.</p>

  <p>Everywhere as the Conference drew near men were enquiring about this
  possible new leader for them. "Is this at last the Messiah we seek, or shall
  we look for another?" Every bookshop in Europe proffered his newly published
  book of utterances, Looking Forward, to gauge what manner of mind they had to
  deal with. It proved rather disconcerting reading for their anxious minds.
  Plainly the man was firm, honest and amiable, as the frontispiece portrait
  with its clear frank eyes and large resolute face showed, but the text of the
  book was a politician's text, saturated indeed with good will, seasoned with
  much vague modernity, but vague and wanting in intellectual grip. "He's
  good," they said, "but is this good enough?"</p>

  <p>Nevertheless hope fought a stout fight. There was no other personality
  visible who even promised to exorcize the spell that lay upon the economic
  life of the race. It was Roosevelt's Conference or nothing. And in spite of
  that disappointing book there remained some sound reasons for hope. In
  particular the President, it was asserted, had a "Brain Trust". A number of
  indisputably able and modern-minded men were his associates, such men as
  Professors Tugwell, Moley and Dickinson, men whose later work played a
  significant part in that reconstruction of legal and political method which
  was America's particular contribution to Modern State ideas. This "last hope
  of mankind", it was credibly reported, called these intimates by their
  Christian names and they called him "Guv'nor." He was said to have the
  modesty and greatness to defer to their studied and matured opinions.
  Observers, still hopeful, felt that if he listened to these advisors things
  might not go so badly after all. He was at any rate one point better than the
  European politicians and heads of States who listened only to bankers and
  big-business men.</p>

  <p>But was he listening? Did he grasp the threefold nature of the problem in
  hand? He understood, it seemed, the need for monetary inflation to reduce the
  burthen of debt and over-capitalization; he was apparently alive to the need
  for a progressive expansion of public employment; and so far he was sound.
  Unless, which is not quite clear, he wavered between "public" and "publicly
  assisted", which was quite another matter. But was he sound upon the
  necessity that these measures should be world-wide or practically world-wide?
  He made some unexpected changes of attitude in these respects. Were these
  changes inconstancies or were they tactical manoeuvres veiling a profoundly
  consistent and resolute purpose? Was it wise to be tactical when all the
  world was in need of plain speech and simple directive ideas? His treatment
  took on a disconcertingly various quality. He listened, it seemed, to his
  advisors; but was he not also listening to everybody? He was flirting with
  bimetallism. No medicine, it seemed, was to be spared.</p>

  <p>The Conference opened with a stout determination to be brilliant and
  eventful; the hotels were full, the streets beflagged, the programme of
  entertainments was admirable, and even the English weather seemed to make an
  effort. The opening addresses by the King of England and his Prime Minister
  Ramsay MacDonald make very curious reading to-day. They express an acute
  recognition of the crucial condition of human affairs. They state in so many
  words that the failure of the Conference will precipitate world disaster.
  They insist upon the necessity for world cooperation, for monetary
  simplification and a resumption of employment; and in all that we admit they
  had the truth of the matter. But they make not the faintest intimation of how
  these desirable ends are to be obtained. They made gestures that are
  incomprehensible to us unless they had an inkling of the primary elements of
  the situation. And then immediately they turned away to other things. That
  mixture of resolve and failure to attack is what perplexes us most. If they
  saw the main essentials of the situation they certainly did not see them as a
  connected whole; they did not see any line of world action before them.</p>

  <p>Cordell Hull, the chief of the United States delegation, was equally large
  and fine. The grave and splendid words&mdash;shot with piety in the best
  American tradition&mdash;that he inscribed upon the roll of history were as
  follows: "Selfishness must be banished. If&mdash;which God forbid!&mdash;any
  nation should wreck this Conference, with the notion that its local interests
  might profit, that nation would merit the execration of mankind."</p>

  <p>Again Daladier, the French Prime Minister, opened with extremely broad and
  sane admissions. He insisted strongly on a necessity which the two opening
  English speeches had minimized, the necessity, the urgent necessity, for a
  progressive development of great public works throughout the world to absorb
  the unemployed and restore consumption. The Americans in the second week
  seemed to be coming in line with that. But after this much of lucidity the
  Conference fell away to minor issues. Apparently it could not keep at so high
  a level of reality. The pressure of the Mass and the Press behind each
  delegate began to tell upon him. The national representatives began to insist
  with increasing explicitness that national interests must not be sacrificed
  to the general good, and in a little time it became doubtful if there could
  be such a thing as the general good. The World Economic Conference became by
  imperceptible transitions a World Economic Conflict just as the League of
  Nations had become a diplomatic bargain mart. All the fine preluding of the
  first séances withered to fruitlessness because the mind of the world had
  still to realize the immense moral and educational effort demanded by those
  triple conditions that were dawning upon its apprehension, and because it was
  still unwilling to accept the immense political pooling they indicated. The
  amount of self-abnegation involved was an insurmountable psychological
  barrier in the way of the representatives present. It would have meant a
  sacrifice of the very conditions that had made them. How could men appointed
  as national representatives accept a pooling of national interests? They were
  indeed fully prepared to revolutionize the world situation and change
  gathering misery to hope, plenty and order, but only on the impossible
  condition that they were not to change themselves and that nothing essential
  to their importance changed. The leading ideas of the Conference were
  cloudily true, but the disintegrative forces of personal, party and national
  egotism were too strong for them.</p>

  <p>It is a very curious thing that the representatives of Soviet Russia did
  nothing to enlighten the obscurity of the world riddle. It is still argued by
  many writers that the Bolshevik régime was the direct precursor of our Modern
  World-State as it exists to-day. But there was no direct continuity. The
  Modern State arose indeed out of the same social imperatives and the same
  constructive impulses that begot Marxism and Leninism, but as an independent,
  maturer, and sounder revolutionary conception. The Soviet system certainly
  anticipated many of the features of our present order in its profession of
  internationalism, in its very real socialism, and particularly in the
  presence of a devoted controlling organization, the Communist Party, which
  foreshadowed our Modern State Fellowship. But there was always a wide
  divergence in Russia between theory and practice, and Litvinoff, who spoke on
  behalf of that first great experiment in planning, was too preoccupied with
  various particular points at issue between his country and the western world,
  trading embargoes and difficulties of credit, for example, to use the
  occasion as he might have done, for a world-wide appeal. He did nothing to
  apply the guiding principles of Communism to the world situation. Here was a
  supreme need for planning, but he said nothing for a Five Year or Ten Year
  Plan for all the world. Here was a situation asking plainly for collective
  employment, and he did not even press the inevitability of world-socialism.
  Apparently he had forgotten the world considered as a whole as completely as
  any of the capitalist delegates. He was thinking of Russia versus the other
  States of the world as simply as if he were an ordinary capitalist
  patriot.</p>

  <p>The claims of the other delegations were even more shortsighted and
  uninspired. Since there was a time-limit set to their speeches, they
  compressed their assertions of general humanitarian benevolence to a phrase
  or so and then came to business. Only Senator Connolly, from the Irish Free
  State, protested against the blinkered outlooks of his fellow speakers and
  pleaded for a consideration of "every possible theory, however unorthodox."
  But his own speech propounded no substantial constructive ideas. He was too
  obsessed by an embargo that England had put upon Irish exports, and to that
  he settled down...</p>

  <p>The whole idea of the Modern World-State, Moreton Canby insists, is to be
  traced, albeit in a warped and sterilized form, alike in the expressed idea-
  systems of the Americans, the British, the French and the Russians at the
  Conference. In the American statements it is wrapped about and hidden by
  individualist phrases and precautions, in the British it is overlaid by
  imperialist assumptions, in the Russian it is made unpalatable by the false
  psychology and harsh jargon of Marxism. In the first the business man refuses
  to change and get out of the way, in the second the imperialist
  administrator, and in the third the doctrinaire party man. Athwart every
  assertion of general principles drive the misty emotions of patriotism, party
  and personal association. Yet for all that it is indisputable that the Modern
  World-State was definitely adumbrated at London in 1933. Like a ghost out of
  the future its presence was felt by nearly everyone, though the worst phases
  of the Age of Frustration had still to come, though generations of suffering
  had still to lapse, before it could appear as the living reality of human
  political life.</p>

  <p>The ghost, says Canby, did not materialise because there was no material.
  Every large country in the world was feeling its way towards the essentials
  of a permanently progressive world-state but none was yet within reach even
  of its partial and local realisation. Roosevelt II and his eleventh hour
  effort to reconstruct America, he finds particularly interesting. The
  President was clearly aware of the need to relieve debt by inflation, but he
  was unable to check the dissipation of the liberated energy in speculation.
  He was dealing with men, trained and saturated in the tradition of poker, to
  whom a solemn cunning had become a second nature, and he was asking them
  (with occasional fierce threats) to display an open-faced helpfulness. He had
  no proper civil service available to control large public works; it was
  impossible to change the American technicians at one blow from
  quasi-financial operators to a candid, devoted public salariat. So he tried
  to induce profiteers to forego profits and organise their industries on
  altruistic lines by dire threats of socialisation which he had no managing
  class to enforce. And he was as ignorant of British or European mentality and
  as little able to get to an understanding with it as Wilson had been before
  him. It was a mutual misunderstanding, but his manners were self-righteous
  and provocative. He began to scold long before the Conference was over. By
  1935 everyone was pointing to a sort of contrasted parallelism between
  America and Russia. Each was manifestly struggling towards a more
  scientifically organised state, and each was finding the same difficulty in
  reconciling productive efficiency in the general interest with primarily
  political control. Technician and politician had still to be assimilated one
  to the other. Each great dictatorship was at war with the speculator and the
  profiteer. Each professed a faint hope of cosmopolitan cooperation and then
  concentrated practically and urgently upon the establishment of an internal
  prosperity. But they started towards that common objective from opposite
  poles of productive efficiency and social assumption. Roosevelt started from
  the standpoint of democratic individualism and Stalin from that of Marxist
  communism. The British system and the other intermediate countries of the
  world struggled to be conservative in the chaos of financial collapse. No
  solvent had yet been devised to synthesise the good will in the world.</p>

  <p>The London Conference rose to no such dramatic climax as the signing of
  the Peace Treaty at Versailles. It rose to nothing. It began at its highest
  point and steadily declined. If Versailles produced a monster, London
  produced nothing at all. Never did so valiant a beginning peter out so
  completely.</p>

  <p>There are abundant intimations in the Press of the time (see Habwright's
  The Sense of Catastrophe in the Nineteen Thirties, a summary of quotations in
  the Historical Documents Series 173,192) of a realization that the political
  and economic morale of that age was played out, and that almost any casual
  selection of men would have been at least as adequate as this gathering of
  old-world political personages to face the vast impending disasters before
  our race. For at any rate these men had already been tried and tested and
  found wanting. Mr. Ramsay MacDonald indeed, the British premier, the fine
  flower and summary of professional politics, rolled his r's and his eyes over
  the Conference and seemed still to be hoping that some favourable accident
  out of the void might save him and his like from the damning dissection of
  history. For a time, in the opening glow of the assembly, with the clicking
  photographers recording every studied gesture, with the attentive microphones
  spreading out and pickling for ever his fine voice and his rich accent, with
  bustling secretaries in sedulous attendance, with the well-trained gravity of
  the delegates and particularly the well-matured high seriousness of those
  adepts in public appearance, the Americans, to sustain him, this last
  sublimation of democratic statesmanship may really have believed that some
  kind of favourable incantation was in progress under his direction. He must
  have felt that or he could not have remained there talking. Incantations had
  made him. By the sheer use of voice and gesture he had clambered from extreme
  obscurity to world prominence. If he did not believe in incantation there was
  nothing left for him to believe in. He must have clung to that persuasion to
  the end. But if that was his state of mind at the time, it could hardly have
  survived the comments and criticisms of the next few months. Surely then he
  had some sleepless nights in which even his private incantations failed.</p>

  <p>The World Economic Conference lost its brilliance in a week or so. The
  City, which had been so flushed with hope that for a time its price lists,
  all pluses, looked like war-time cemeteries, relapsed into depression. The
  World Slump did not wait for the Conference to disperse before it resumed. At
  the outset London had been all blown up and distended by bright
  anticipations, so that it was like one of those little squeaking bladders
  children play with, and like one of those bladders, so soon as the blowing
  ceased, it shrank and shrivelled and ended in a dying wail of despair.</p>

  <p>As Habwright puts it, by July 1933 intelligent men and women everywhere
  were saying two things. Of the assembled rulers and delegates they were
  saying: "These people can do nothing for us. They do worse than nothing. They
  intensify the disaster." And in the second place it was demanded with a sort
  of astonishment: "Why have historians, sociologists and economists nothing to
  tell us now? There may indeed be some excuse for the failure of politicians
  under democratic conditions. But have our universities been doing nothing
  about it? Is there indeed no science of these things? Is there no knowledge?
  Has history learnt nothing of causes, and is there no analysis of the social
  processes that are destroying us?"</p>

  <p>To which the professors, greatly preoccupied at that particular date in
  marking honours papers in history and social and political science, made no
  audible reply.</p>

  <p>Before the end of the thirties it was plain to all the world that a world-
  wide social catastrophe was now inevitably in progress, that the sanest thing
  left for intelligent men to do was to set about upon some sort of Noah's Ark
  to salvage whatever was salvageable of civilization, so that there should be
  a new beginning after the rising deluge of misfortune had spent itself. A few
  prescient spirits had been saying as much for some years, but now this idea
  of salvage spread like an epidemic. It prepared the way for the Modern State
  Movement on which our present order rests. At the time, however, the general
  pessimism was little mitigated by any real hope of recovery. One writer,
  quoted by Habwright, compared man to a domesticated ape, "which has had the
  intelligence and ability to drag its straw mattress up to the fire when it is
  cold, but has had neither the wit nor the foresight to escape the consequent
  blaze". Habwright's brief summary of the financial operations that went on as
  the sense of catastrophe grew justifies that grim image very completely.</p>

  <p>The conviction that Parliamentary Democracy had come to an end spread
  everywhere in that decade. Already in the period between the vacillation in
  international affairs after Versailles and the warfare of the Forties, men
  had been going about discussing and scheming and plotting for some form of
  government that should be at least decisive. And now their efforts took on a
  new urgency. There was a world-wide hysteria to change governments and
  officials.</p>

  <p>At its first onset this craving for decisiveness had produced some
  extremely crude results. An epidemic of tawdry "dictatorships" had run over
  Europe from Poland to Spain immediately after the war. For the most part
  these adventures followed the pattern of the pronunciamentos of the small
  South American republics, and were too incidental and inconsequent for the
  student of general history to be troubled about them now. But there followed
  a world-wide development of directive or would-be directive political
  associations which foreshadowed very plainly the organization of the Modern
  State Fellowship upon which our present world order rests.</p>

  <p>The Fascist dictatorship of Mussolini in Italy had something in it of a
  more enduring type than most of the other supersessions of parliamentary
  methods. It rose not as a personal usurpation but as the expression of an
  organization with a purpose and a sort of doctrine of its own. The
  intellectual content of Fascism was limited, nationalist and romantic; its
  methods, especially in its opening phase, were violent and dreadful; but at
  least it insisted upon discipline and public service for its members. It
  appeared as a counter movement to a chaotic labour communism, but its support
  of the still-surviving monarchy and the Church was qualified by a
  considerable boldness in handling education and private property for the
  public benefit. Fascism indeed was not an altogether bad thing; it was a bad
  good thing; and Mussolini has left his mark on history.</p>

  <p>In Russia something still more thorough and broader came into operation
  after 1917. This was the Communist Party. It was the invention of Lenin; he
  continued to modify and adapt its organization and doctrine until his
  untimely death in 1924. While he lived Russia's experiment really seemed to
  be leading the world in its flight towards a new order from the futile
  negations and paralysis of Parliamentary government. It is still profoundly
  interesting to note the modernity of many aspects of the early Bolshevik
  régime.</p>

  <p>This modernity achieved under the stress of urgent necessities and Lenin's
  guidance was attained in spite of many grave difficulties created by the
  Marxist tradition. Marx, who was a man of what the psychologists of the
  middle twenty-first century used to call "blinkered originality", never saw
  through the democratic sentimentalities of the period in which he lived.
  There had been a tendency to exclude the privileged classes from the True
  Democracy of Common Men even at the dawn of the modern democratic idea, and
  he and his followers intensified and stereotyped this tendency in their own
  particular version of deified democracy, the Proletariat. The Proletariat was
  just Pure Masses, and mystical beyond measure.</p>

  <p>But at the outset the actual Russian revolution was under the control of
  the intensely practical and intensely middle-class Lenin, and he took care
  that the great social reconstruction he had in mind was equally secured
  against the risk of paralysis through mass inertia and the risk of overthrow
  through mass panic. His ostensibly "democratic" government of Soviets, the
  Soviet pyramid, was built up on a hierarchic scheme that brought the
  administration face to face only with seasoned representatives who had been
  filtered through an ascendant series of bodies. Moreover, he established a
  very complete control of education and the Press, to keep the thought of the
  nominally sovereign masses upon the right lines. And to animate and control
  the whole machine he had his invention of the Communist Party.</p>

  <p>This Communist Party, like the Italian Fascisti, owes its general
  conception to that germinal idea of the Modern State, the Guardians in
  Plato's Republic. For if anyone is to be called the Father of the Modern
  State it is Plato. The Members of the Communist Party were extremely like
  those Guardians. As early as 1900 critics of democratic institutions were
  discussing the possibility of creating a cult primarily devoted to social and
  political service, self-appointed, self-trained and self-disciplined. The
  English-speaking Socialist movement was debating projects of that kind in
  1909-10 (see Fabian News in Historical Documents for those years), but it
  needed the dangers and stresses of the postwar European situation to produce
  types of workers and young people sufficiently detached, desperate and
  numerous, to unite effectively into a permanent revolutionary control.</p>

  <p>From its beginnings the Communist Party, though it was not divided into
  "faculties" and remained political rather than technical in spirit, resembled
  our own Modern State Fellowship in its insistence upon continuous learning
  and training throughout life, upon free criticism within the limits of the
  party, upon accessibility (under due limitations) to all who wished to serve
  in it, and upon the right to resignation from its privileges and severities
  of all who wished to return to comparative irresponsibility. But the
  conditions which created the Russian Communist Party made it inevitably
  Marxist, and even after a thorough Leninization, Communism, that
  characteristic final product of middle-nineteenth-century radicalism, still
  retained many of its old sentimentalities, reverting indeed more and more
  towards them after Lenin's death and the rule of the devoted but unoriginal,
  suspicious and overbearing Stalin.</p>

  <p>There was a heavy load of democratic and equalitarian cant upon the back
  of the Russian system, just as there was a burthen of patriotic and religious
  cant upon the Italian Fascist. Even the United States Constitution did not
  profess democratic equality and insist upon the inspired wisdom of the
  untutored more obstinately than the new Russian régime. Although hardly any
  of the ruling group of Russians were of peasant or working-class
  origin&mdash;there were far more politicians from that social level in the
  public life of Western Europe and America&mdash;there was a universal
  pretence of commonness about them all. They spat, they went unshaved and
  collarless. They pretended to be indifferent to bourgeois comfort. It was
  ordained that at the phrase "Class-War" every knee should bow. When the
  Communist leaders quarrelled among themselves, "bourgeois" or "petty
  bourgeois" was the favourite term of abuse, none the less deadly because it
  was almost invariably true. Long years were to pass before any movement
  whatever in the direction of the Modern State System was quite free from this
  heritage of cant.</p>

  <p>One unfortunate aspect of this entanglement of the new experiment in
  Russia with the social envies and hatreds of the old order was its inability
  to assimilate competent technicians, organizers and educators into its
  direction. In its attempt to modernize, it refused the assistance of just the
  most characteristically modern types in the community. But since these types
  had a special education and knew things not generally known, it was difficult
  to accord them proletarian standing. In Russia therefore, as in America, the
  politician with his eloquence and his necessary and habitual disingenuousness
  still intervened and obstructed, if he did not actually bar, the way to a
  scientific development of a new economic and social order.</p>

  <p>Manifestly Stalin learnt much from his difficulties with the Five Year
  Plan of the evil of subordinating technical to political ability, and a
  speech of his upon the Old and New Technical Intelligentzia made in June 1931
  (Historical Documents Series, Stalinism, XM 327,705) is a very frank
  admission of the primary necessity in the modern community of the "non-party"
  man of science and of special knowledge. Unhappily the hand of the party
  politician in Russia was strengthened by the untrammelled activities of those
  strange protectors of Marxist authority the Checka, which became later the
  G.P.U. So from 1928, the date of the First Five Year Plan, in spite of a
  great driving-force of enthusiastic devotion, Russia went clumsily, heavily
  and pretentiously&mdash;a politician's dictatorship, propaganding rather than
  performing, disappointing her well-wishers abroad and thwarting the best
  intelligences she produced. When her plans went wrong through her lack of
  precise material foresight, she accused, and imprisoned or shot, engineers
  and suchlike technical workers.</p>

  <p>A further bad result of this ineradicable democratic taint of the Soviet
  system was the widening estrangement of the Russian process from Western
  creative effort. Instead of being allies they became opponents. As the
  challenge of social disintegration became more urgent in the Atlantic
  countries, it became plainer and plainer that such hope as there was for the
  salvaging of a reconstructed civilization from a welter of disaster lay in
  the coordinate effort of intelligent, able and energetic individuals of every
  nation, race, type and class. A revolution was certainly needed, but not a
  revolution according to the time-worn formula of street battles and
  barricades, not a class war. A revolution in the very character of
  revolutions had to occur. There was no need for insurrectionary revolution
  any longer, since now the system was destroying itself. The phase for boldly
  constructive revolution had arrived, and at every point where constructive
  effort was made the nagging antagonism of the Class War fanatic appeared, to
  impede and divide. (See, for example, Upton Sinclair on this conflict, in The
  Way Out, 1933, in the series of reprints under his name, Historical Documents
  Series, History of Opinion.)</p>

  <p>The waste of creative energy was enormous, not only in Russia but all over
  the world. Multitudes of young men and women in every civilized community,
  the living hope of the race, dissipated their generous youth and vigour in
  bitter conflicts upon a purely doctrinaire issue. The poison of nationalism
  was abroad to complicate their reactions. Many turned against progress
  altogether and sought to thrust the world back to some imaginary lost age of
  virtue. So they became Ku Klux Klansmen, Nationalists, Nazis. All felt the
  natural youthful impulse towards large, effective, vehement action. All meant
  well. They were one in spirit though they suffered from a confusion of
  tongues. The idea of the Modern State could not for a long time make itself
  clear to their imaginations largely because the conspicuous
  self-contradictions of Russia stood in the way.</p>

  <p>Russia seemed to lead, it sought to lead in its acts and deeds, and it
  lied. Meanwhile, surviving very largely because of this distraction of
  creative forces, the elderly methods of Parliamentary Democracy and the
  elderly Nationalist Diplomacy remained in possession of the greater part of
  the Western World, and the social collapse it was powerless to arrest
  continued.</p>

  <p class="first">Faber in his interesting and suggestive Historical Analyses
  (2103) discusses how far the wars, depressions, pestilences, phases of
  semi-famine and periods of actual starvation, in the hundred years before
  2014, were necessary, and how far, with the resources then available, they
  might have been avoided by mankind. He takes the view that the encumbrance of
  tradition was so great that for all that period this martyrdom of our kind
  was inevitable. He argues that without the sufferings of these generations
  men's minds could never have been sufficiently purged of their obstinate
  loyalties, jealousies, fears and superstitions; men's wills never roused to
  the efforts, disciplines and sacrifices that were demanded for the
  establishment of the Modern State.</p>

  <p>Faber applies his criticism more particularly to this so-called decadence
  of education after (circa) 1930. It has hitherto been usual to treat the ebb
  of school-building and schooling that took place then as a real
  retrogression, to rank it with the fall in the general standard of life and
  the deterioration of public health. But he advanced some excellent reasons
  for supposing that, so far from being an evil, the starvation and
  obliteration of the old-world teaching machinery was a necessary preliminary
  to social recovery.</p>

  <p>The common school, he insists, had to be born again, had to be remade
  fundamentally. And before that could happen it had to be broken up and
  wellnigh destroyed. He sweeps aside almost contemptuously the claim that the
  nineteenth century was an educational century. We are misled, he argues, by a
  mere resemblance between the schools and universities of the past and the
  schools and post-school education of the modern period. Both occupy the time
  of the young, and we do not sufficiently appreciate the fact that what they
  are doing with the young is something entirely different. Our education is an
  introduction to the continual revolutionary advance of life. But education
  before the twenty-first century was essentially a conservative process. It
  was so rigorously and completely traditional that its extensive
  disorganization was an inevitable preliminary to the foundation of a new
  world.</p>

  <p>The word education has come now to cover almost all intellectual
  activities throughout life except research and artistic creation. That was
  not its original meaning. It meant originally the preparation of the young
  for life. It did not go on even in extreme cases beyond three or four and
  twenty, and usually it was over by fourteen! But we draw no line at any age,
  as our ancestors did, when learning ceases. The general information of the
  public, public discussion and collective decisions, all fall within the scope
  of our educational directorate. All that was outside what passed for
  education in the early Twentieth Century.</p>

  <p>What people knew in those days they knew in the most haphazard way. The
  privately owned newspapers of the period told the public what their readers
  or their proprietors desired; the diffusion of facts and ideas by the early
  cinema, the sound radio and so on was entirely commercialized for the
  advertisement of goods in America, and controlled and directed in the
  interests of influential politicians in Great Britain; book-publishing, even
  the publication of scientific works, was mainly speculative and competitive,
  and there was no such thing as a Centre of Knowledge in the world.</p>

  <p>It is remarkable to note how long mankind was able to carry on without any
  knowledge organization whatever. No encyclopaedia, not even a bookseller's
  encyclopaedia, had existed before the seventeenth century, for the so-called
  Chinese Encyclopaedia was a literary miscellany, and there was no permanent
  organization of record even on the part of such mercenary encyclopaedias as
  came into existence after that date. Nor was there any conception of the need
  of a permanent system of ordered knowledge, continually revised until the
  twentieth century was nearing its end. To the people of the Age of
  Frustration our interlocking research, digest, discussion, verification,
  notification and informative organizations, our Fundamental Knowledge System,
  that is, with its special stations everywhere, its regional bureaus, its
  central city at Barcelona, its seventeen million active workers and its five
  million correspondents and reserve enquirers, would have seemed incredibly
  vast. It would have seemed incredibly vast to them in spite of the fact that
  the entirely unproductive armies and military establishments they sustained
  in those days of universal poverty were practically as huge.</p>

  <p>We are still enlarging this Brain of Mankind, still increasing its cells,
  extending its records and making its interactions more rapid and effective. A
  vast independent literature flourishes beside it. Compared with today our
  species in the Age of Frustration was as a whole brainless: it was
  collectively invertebrate with a few scattered ill-connected ganglia; it was
  lethargically ignorant; it had still to develop beyond the crude rudiments of
  any coordinated knowledge at all.</p>

  <p>But not only was general knowledge rudimentary, casual, erroneous and bad.
  Faber's case against the old education is worse than that. Knowledge was
  explicitly outside education, outside formal schooling altogether. The need
  for a sound common ideology is a Modern State idea. The old, so called
  "Elementary" schools, Faber shows, did not pretend to give knowledge. So far
  as directive ideas were concerned, they disavowed this intention. He quotes a
  very revealing contemporary survey of the situation in America by Dr. G. S.
  Counts (The American Road to Culture, 1930) in which the complete ideological
  sterilization of the common schools of the Republic is demonstrated beyond
  question. The sterilization was deliberate. So far as the giving of
  comprehensive information about life went, says Faber, there was absolutely
  nothing valuable destroyed during this period of educational collapse because
  nothing valuable had as yet got into the curricula. The history taught in
  these popular schools was pernicious patriotic twaddle; the biology,
  non-existent or prudish and childish &mdash;the "facts of sex", as they were
  called, were for example TAUGHT by dissecting flowers&mdash;and there was no
  economic instruction whatever. The nineteenth-century "education" was not
  enlightenment; it was anti-enlightenment. Parents, political and religious
  organizations watched jealously that this should be so. He quotes school
  time-tables and public discussions and gives samples of the textbooks in
  use.</p>

  <p>The decline in scientific research, moreover, during this age of systole,
  Faber insists, has been greatly exaggerated. Although there was certainly a
  considerable diminution in the number of actual workers through the
  destruction of private endowments and what was called "economy", and although
  there was also a considerable interference with the international exchange of
  ideas and a slacking down in pace at which ideas grew, there was no absolute
  interruption in the advance of ordered science even through the worst phases
  of the social breakdown. Research displayed a protean adaptability and
  indestructibility. It shifted from the patronage of the millionaire to the
  patronage of the war lord; it took refuge in Russia, Spain and South America;
  it betook itself to the aeroplane hangars, to rise again in due time to its
  present world-predominance. It had never been pampered under the régime of
  private capitalism. All through that First Age of Prosperity pure research
  had lived from hand to mouth. As soon as it paid, says Sinclair Lewis in
  Martin Arrowsmith, it was commercialized and it degenerated. When the bad
  times came the parasites of science fell away, but the genuine scientific
  worker, accustomed to scanty supplies, tightened his belt a little more and
  in all sorts of out-of-the-way places stuck to his job.</p>

  <p>What really did break up in this period between 1930 and 1950 was a
  systematic schooling of the masses which had developed steadily during the
  nineteenth century. Beyond the elements of reading, speech and counting, this
  was no more and no less than a drilling in tradition. There had been some
  reforms, more particularly in method, some advance in the teaching of infants
  (though this was sacrificed early in the economy flurry), and a few
  exceptional schools emerged, but this was the character of the typical school
  of the time. A progressive multiplication of this kind of school had indeed
  gone on in nearly every country in the world even up to the outbreak of the
  Great War. The proportion of "literates" who could at least read increased
  steadily. After that the rate of advance (except in Russia after 1917, where
  popular teaching was only beginning) fell stage by stage to zero. But what
  was ebbing was not really knowledge or instruction at all, but a training in
  the binding traditions of the old society.</p>

  <p>The story of what used to be called "the conflict between religion and
  science" belongs mainly to the history of the nineteenth century, and we will
  not tell again here how the fairly stable structure of Christian belief and
  disciplines was weakened by the changes in values that ensued from the
  revelation of geological and biological horizons in that period. Before 1850
  more than ninety-nine per cent of the population of Europe and America
  believed unquestioningly that the universe had been created in the year 4004
  B.C. Their intellectual lives were all cramped to the dimensions of that
  petty cellule of time. It was rather frightening for them to break out. They
  succumbed to mental agoraphobia. The student knows already of the
  difficulties experienced by the Christian ministry during those years of
  mental release and expansion in "symbolizing" the Fall and Atonement, which
  had hitherto been taught as historical facts, and of the loss of confidence
  and authority that came through this unavoidable ambiguity. The ensuing
  controversies thundered and died away into mutterings and ironies, but the
  consequences of these disputes became more and more evident in the succeeding
  generations. They evinced themselves in a universal moral indefiniteness. The
  new and old cancelled out.</p>

  <p>The accepted Christian world outlook, both that prescribed by the Catholic
  Church and that of the various dissentient Protestant sects, had carried with
  it a coarse but fairly effective moral imperative. Hell was the ultima ratio
  of good behaviour. The Churches, although badly damaged in argument, were
  well endowed and powerfully entrenched in the educational organization. Their
  practical resistance to the new views proved to be more effective than their
  controversial efforts. People had the social habit of belonging to them and
  entrusting their children to them. There were no other teachers ready; no
  other schools. So the traditional orthodoxies were able to obstruct the
  development of a modern ethic in harmony with the new realizations of man's
  place in space and time, in spite of the loss of much of their former power
  of unquestionable conviction.</p>

  <p>Gradually throughout the First Age of General Prosperity the relative
  value of their endowments diminished, and they lost intellectual and moral
  prestige. But it was only with the economic landslides of the post-war period
  that their material foundations gave way completely. For a time these great
  organizations share in the common disaster, and when at last under new
  auspices a restoration of production occurred they recovered nothing of their
  proportional importance. Their old investments had vanished. They suffered
  with other landlords in the general resumption of estates by the community.
  By 1965 C.E. it was no longer possible for an ordinary young man to get a
  living as a minister of any Church. Holy orders, since they implied an
  old-world outlook, were also a grave encumbrance for an ambitious teacher. It
  was extraordinary with what facility the priests and parsons changed their
  collars and vanished into the crowd with the progressive disappearance of
  their endowments. The organized Christian Churches pass out of history at
  last almost as quickly as the priesthood of Baal vanished after the Persian
  conquest. There is considerable plausibility in Faber's contention that they
  could have disappeared in no other way.</p>

  <p>It had been usual to treat the extensive destruction of social morale
  which characterized this period as due to the interregnum between the fading
  out of the Christian ethic and the moral and intellectual establishment of
  modern conduct. Faber questions that boldly. He admits that the morale of
  Western civilization was built up very largely by Christian agencies, but he
  denies that they were sustaining it. He ascribes its evaporation almost
  entirely to the destruction of social confidence which we have noted already
  as a natural consequence of the wild fluctuations of economic security and
  monetary values at that time. Men ceased to respect society because they felt
  they were being cheated and betrayed by society.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap2_03"
     name="chap2_03">3. &mdash; DISINTEGRATION AND CRYSTALLIZATION<br>
  IN THE SOCIAL MAGMA; THE GANGSTER AND<br>
  MILITANT POLITICAL ORGANIZATIONS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The dissolutions and regroupings of people that were going
  on through this period have always attracted the attention of the social
  philosopher. The common man had lost his faith in a friendly God, his
  confidence in social justice and his educational and social services. He was
  out of employment and stirred by unsatisfied appetites. The time-honoured
  life of work and family interests had become impossible for a growing
  majority.</p>

  <p>What we now call social nucleation was failing; the grouping of human
  beings in families and working communities was not going on. They became
  restive and troublesome. The social confidence and discipline that had
  prevailed throughout the nineteenth century deteriorated very rapidly. There
  was a swift fall in social security.</p>

  <p>Phases of fever have occurred time without number in human history, phases
  of unsettlement and confused motivation, clottings and drives and migrations
  of population. Periods of tranquil assurance are the exception throughout the
  ages. But in the past it has usually been the exhaustion of food supplies,
  pestilence or some cruel invasion that has broken up the social texture and
  made humanity lawless again. This new disintegration was of a different
  character. It was due in the first place to an increase rather than a
  diminution of material and energy in the social scheme. It was a process of
  expansion which went wrong through the inadequacy of traditional law and
  government.</p>

  <p>The disintegrative forces were already evident in the eighteenth century;
  they became very conspicuous in the French Revolution and the subsequent
  social and political disturbances but they only rose to a plain domination of
  the controlling forces after the World War.</p>

  <p>In the seventeenth century, when population was thin and hardly anyone
  moved about, it had been possible to keep order by means of a village
  constable, to try the malefactor by a local magistrate and jury which knew
  him thoroughly and understood his position and motives. Dogberry and Shallow
  sufficed. But the economic growth of the eighteenth century increased the
  size of towns and the traffic on the newly made roads between them without
  any corresponding increase in the forces of order. It produced, therefore,
  the urban mob, the footpad, the highwayman and the brigand. The local
  constable was unequal to these new demands; the local magistrate as
  inadequate. There was a phase of increasing crime.</p>

  <p>After the failure of a régime of savage punishment uncertainly inflicted,
  after the excesses of the first French Revolution, after phases of mob
  violence in every European capital, and endless other manifestations of this
  outpacing of social control, the machinery of government did by an effort
  adjust itself to the new conditions. More or less modernized police forces
  appeared throughout the world and inaugurated a new phase of order and
  security, a phase which reached its maximum in the years before the Great
  War. For a time then the world, or at any rate very considerable areas of it,
  was almost as safe as it is today. An unarmed man could go about in
  reasonable security in most of Europe, India, China, America. Nobody offered
  him violence or attempted open robbery. Even the policeman in the
  English-speaking and Western European communities carried no weapon but a
  truncheon.</p>

  <p>But the World War broke down many of the inhibitions of violence and
  bloodshed that had been built up during the progressive years of the
  nineteenth century and an accumulating number of intelligent, restless
  unemployed men, in a new world of motor-cars, telephones, plate-glass shop
  windows, unbarred country houses and trustful social habits, found themselves
  faced with illegal opportunities far more attractive than any legal
  behaviour-system now afforded them. And now after the world slump that
  insanity of public economy which runs like a disease through the story of the
  age prevented any prompt enlargement and modernization of the existing
  educational, legal or police organizations. The scale and prestige of the
  law-court and police-court dwindled as the problems presented to them by the
  vast irregular developments of that period of stress and perplexity
  increased.</p>

  <p>So the stage was set for a lawless phase. The criminal was liberated from
  parochialism and reactionary economies long before his antagonist the
  policeman, and he experienced all the invigoration and enlargement of that
  release. The criminal grew big while the law, pot-bound in its traditional
  swathings, was unable to keep pace with him.</p>

  <p>The criminal records of this disorderly interlude make strange reading
  today. Things that were terrible enough at the time appear to us now as they
  recede into the past through a thickening, highly retractile veil of
  grotesqueness and picturesque absurdity. We read about them, as we read about
  mediaeval tortures or cannibal feasts or war atrocities or human sacrifice,
  with a startled incredulity. We laugh now; it is all so IMPOSSIBLE. Few of us
  actually realize these were flesh-and-blood sufferings that living men and
  women went through only a century and a half ago.</p>

  <p>The criminals of the more fortunate countries of the European system,
  during that First Age of General Prosperity before the World War, like the
  few cases of intolerable behaviour with which society deals today, had
  constituted a small abnormal and diminishing minority for the most part
  mental defectives or at best very inferior types. The majority of their
  offences were emotional or brutish offences. There was some stealing and a
  steady proportion of swindling in business, not sufficient to disturb the
  social order at all seriously. But as the morale of the old order dissolved,
  this ceased to be the case. Increasing numbers of intelligent and
  enterprising people found themselves in conflict with society because, as
  they argued very reasonably, society had cheated them. Patriotism too, they
  felt, had cheated them and given them nothing but poverty and war. They had
  never had a fair chance. They looked after themselves and left the community
  to look after itself. They fell back on the nearer loyalties of their
  immediate associates.</p>

  <p>Your "pal" at any rate was close at hand. If he "let you down", you had a
  fair chance to "get at" him. Little gang-nuclei came into existence,
  therefore, wherever unassimilated elements of the population were congested
  and humiliated or wherever intelligent men festered in unemployment and
  need.</p>

  <p>In 1900 European society in particular was still nucleated about the
  family group in relation to a generally understood code of lawful behaviour.
  In 1950 its individuals were either nucleated into gangs, groups or societies
  or dissolved into crowds, and the influence and pretence of any universally
  valid standard of good conduct had disappeared.</p>

  <p>Robbery is the first great division in the catalogue of anti-social
  offences. Every efficient government in the past reserved to itself the sole
  right of dispossession, and every intelligent government exercised the right
  with extreme discretion. In the past of unregulated private ownership the
  filching of portable objects and raids upon unguarded possessions were always
  going on. In Great Britain, in which country the highest levels of social
  order were attained during the First Age of General Prosperity, stealing
  (with which we may include various forms of embezzlement and fraud) remained
  the chief offence upon the list. Almost all the others had become
  exceptional. But whenever there was a dip in the common prosperity, more
  active methods of robbery appeared to supplement the ordinary theft. The
  snatcher began to take his chance with bags and watches. The enterprise of
  the burglar increased. Then came the simple hold-up under threats, or robbery
  with assault. In a world of general confidence, unarmed and unaccompanied
  people were going about everywhere wearing valuable jewellery and carrying
  considerable sums of money. But that atmosphere of confidence could be
  rapidly chilled. Even in later-nineteenth-century Britain there were
  epidemics of robbery by single men or by men in couples, the "garrotters" of
  the sixties, for example, who assaulted suddenly from behind and seized the
  watch and pocket-book. They would clap a pitch plaster over their victim's
  mouth. There were brief phases when the suburban regions even of London and
  Paris became unsafe, and at no time were any but the more central regions of
  some of the great American cities secure. This kind of thing increased
  notably everywhere after the World War.</p>

  <p>There were manifest limits to this hold-up business. It was something that
  extinguished itself. There had to be a general feeling of practical security
  for that type of robbery to prosper. There had to be people to rob. Robbery
  from the person is an acute and not a chronic disease of communities. So soon
  as the footpad became too prevalent people ceased to carry so many valuables,
  they shunned lonely or dark streets and roads, they went about in company and
  began to bear arms. The epidemic of hold-ups passed its maximum and
  declined.</p>

  <p>The criminally disposed soon learnt the importance of association for the
  exploitation of new lines of effort. With a more alert and defensive and less
  solitary type of victim, the casual criminal developed into the planning
  criminal. In every country multiplying nuclei of crime began to work out the
  problems of that terroristic gang discipline which is imperative upon those
  who combine to defy the law. In Europe the intensifying tariff wars put an
  increasing premium upon the enterprise of the smuggler, and in smuggling
  enterprises men readily developed those furtive secret loyalties, those sub-
  laws of the underworld, which proved so readily applicable to more aggressive
  efforts. In America the repressive laws against alcohol had already created
  the necessary conditions for a similar morbid organization of gang systems,
  which had become readily confluent with the older associations for political
  corruption and terrorism. As the economic breakdown proceeded throughout the
  thirties and forties of the twentieth century, ordinary social security
  diminished even more rapidly in America than in Europe. But everywhere a
  parallel dégringolade was going on. Now it would be the criminal forces in
  one country and now those in another which were leading in novel attacks upon
  the law-abiding citizen of the decaying order.</p>

  <p>The hold-up in force became bolder and more frequent. History repeated
  itself with variations. In the place of the highwayman of the seventeenth and
  eighteenth centuries came the motor-car bandit and the train-robber.
  Trains-de-luxe were successfully held up by armed bands, first of all in
  Eastern Europe and America and then very generally. These were operations
  involving the concerted action of a dozen men or more, who had to be sure of
  their "get away" and with a market for their loot. Country houses and country
  clubs full of wealthy guests presently began to be attacked&mdash;the
  telephones cut and the whole place systematically looted. Restaurants,
  gambling-clubs and other resorts of people with full pocket-books were also
  raided with increasing efficiency. Local banks and bank branches became
  insecure. Until the nineteen-thirties a town bank had a large open handsome
  office with swinging doors, low counters and glass partitions. Ten years
  later the face of the bank had changed: the clerks were protected by steel
  defences, they were armed with revolvers, and they parleyed with the customer
  through small pigeonholes that could be promptly closed.</p>

  <p>This change in the scale and quality of aggressive crime was reflected in
  public manners and display. The wearing of jewellery, gold watch-chains,
  expensive studs and suchlike challenges to poverty declined, costume became
  more "buttoned up" and restrained. Hip-pocket weapons spread from America to
  Europe. Women's dress and ornaments, though if anything they improved in
  their artistic quality, diminished in intrinsic value. Everywhere there was a
  diminution of social ostentation. Houses with narrow exterior windows and
  well equipped with steel doors, locks, bolts and bars, were preferred to
  those candidly exposed to sunlight and exterior observation. The window
  displays of the town shops became more guarded.</p>

  <p>The need for protection and the dread of conspicuousness affected
  automobile design. The common automobile of the middle twentieth century was
  a sullen-looking pugnacious beast. And its occupants were in harmony with it.
  Before the World War the spectacle of a broken-down vehicle or any such
  trouble by the wayside would induce almost any passing car to stop and offer
  assistance. Under the new conditions people feared a decoy. They would refuse
  to stop after twilight, and even in the daytime they sometimes hurried on,
  though injured or apparently injured people might be lying by the
  roadside.</p>

  <p>Travel diminished very rapidly under such conditions. There is some
  difficulty about the statistics, but between 1928 and 1938 the number of
  pleasure travellers upon the roads and railways of continental Europe fell by
  something over, rather than under, eighty per cent. There were, of course,
  other causes at work besides the general insecurity of movement in producing
  this decline; there was a general impoverishment also which disposed people
  to stay at home. But the major factor was insecurity.</p>

  <p>The roads were less and less frequented as they became unsafe. Many fell
  out of repair, and the old road-signs and petrol pumps, now dear to our
  school-museum collectors, vanished one by one from the landscape.</p>

  <p>Improvements in robbery were only one group of the criminal developments
  in progress. A much more distressful aspect was the organization of
  terroristic blackmail, at first directed against individuals and then against
  whole classes in the community. As people ceased to travel to be robbed, the
  robber had to pursue them to their homes. Here again American inventiveness
  and enterprise led the world. By imperceptible degrees the ordinary
  prosperous citizen found his life enmeshed in a tangle of threats and vague
  anxieties. Even during the prosperous period there had been an element of
  menace in the lives of the American well-to-do; their securities had never
  been quite secure and their positions never perfectly stable. But now over
  and above the ever increasing instability of possessions and income came the
  increasing need to buy off molestation. Breaking through the now inadequate
  protection of the police appeared silently and grimly and more and more
  openly the blackmailer, the kidnapper and the gang terrorist.</p>

  <p>A particularly cruel form of attack upon unprotected private people was
  the threatening and kidnapping of young children. It had a minor grotesque
  side in the stealing and ransoming of pet animals. Many hundreds of children
  had been stolen, hidden away, and brought back for reward before the
  abduction and murder of the child of Colonel Lindbergh, a long-distance
  aviator very popular in America, called general attention to this increasing
  nuisance. Nothing effective, however, was done to control these practices,
  and in the bad years that followed 1930 kidnapping and the threat of
  kidnapping increased very greatly, and spread to the old world. It was
  organised. Men and women were spirited away, intimidated by threats of
  torture, held captive. If the pursuit was pressed too hard they disappeared
  and were heard of no more. Assassinations multiplied. Bodies of men set
  themselves up almost without concealment under such names as Citizens'
  Protection Societies, or Civil Order Associations. The man who wanted to be
  left alone in peace, he and his household, was pressed to pay his tribute to
  the gang. Or he would not be left in peace. And even if his particular
  "protectors" left him in peace, there might still be other gangs about for
  whom they disavowed responsibility and with whom he had to make a separate
  deal.</p>

  <p>It was not merely the well-to-do who were worried and levied upon in this
  fashion. An increasing proportion of minor workers and traders found it
  necessary to pay a percentage of their gains or earnings to escape systematic
  persecution. "Trouble" was the characteristic American word. "You don't want
  to have trouble," said the blackmailer, gently but insistently.</p>

  <p>The new generation grew up into a world of secret compromises and
  underhand surrenders. The common man picked his way discreetly through a
  world of possible trouble. No one dared live who was not a member (and
  servant) of a Union of some kind. It was a return to very ancient conditions,
  conditions that had prevailed for ages in China, for instance, and in Sicily
  and Southern Italy. But it was a relapse from the freedom and confidence of
  the better days at the close of the nineteenth century. It was a contraction
  of everyday human happiness.</p>

  <p>Kidnapping was not confined to kidnapping for ransom. There had always
  been a certain irrepressible trade in the beguiling and stealing of young
  persons for sexual prostitution, and this also increased again. Workers were
  kidnapped, and the intimidation of workers in factories became bolder and
  less formally legal. There was a great release of violence in personal
  quarrels, and in particular crimes of revenge multiplied. In a phase of
  dwindling confidence and happiness, people of spirit no longer recoiled from
  the tragic ending of oppressive situations. They took the law into their own
  hands. They began to fight and kill, and they were no longer inevitably
  overtaken by the law.</p>

  <p>The remaining rich, the financial adventurers who still appeared, the
  prominent political leaders, the transitory "kings" of the underworld, all
  surrounded themselves with bodyguards. Types recalling the hired "bravos" of
  the Italian cities of the later Middle Ages and the Samurai of the Japanese
  noblemen reappeared as the hefty private attendants of the wealthier
  Americans. After the economic slump had fairly set in the posse of needy
  retainers became a universal practice with all who could afford it. They
  protected the person and the home. They supplemented the police.</p>

  <p>The transition from a protective to an aggressive bodyguard was
  inevitable. Leading American bootleggers were the chief offenders, but the
  example was contagious. "Brawling" of retainers reappeared first in America,
  Germany and Ireland. These brawls were usually small street battles, or
  conflicts at race meetings and suchlike gatherings, or side issues to
  political meetings and processions. It was a courageous politician who would
  face an audience after 1938 unless he knew that his men were about him and
  posted at strategically important points in the meeting. And he would be
  wearing a mail undervest or suchlike protection of his more vital parts.
  There are hundreds of such garments in our museums.</p>

  <p>No man, woman or child that "mattered" went about "unshadowed" after 1940.
  After the middle nineteenth century women had made great advances toward
  personal freedom. About 1912 a pretty girl in her teens might have taken a
  knapsack and marched off alone through the northern states of Europe or
  America in perfect safety, unmolested. All this freedom vanished during the
  age of insecurity. Women ceased to go about without an escort even in the
  towns. It was not until 2014 that there was any real return towards the
  former common liberties of the young and weak and gentle. There was on the
  part of women, as the novels of the time reveal, a survival of social fear in
  human life, the fear of going alone, until the middle of the twenty-first
  century.</p>

  <p>After 1945 a fresh aspect of insecurity appears in the records. There is
  mention of unsafe roadside hotels, and a great increase not simply of
  streets, but of whole districts and villages where "things happened", people
  disappeared, and it was inadvisable for strangers to go. Some of these
  criminally infected areas did not recover their reputations for three
  quarters of a century. The DANGEROUS big hotel with its secret lifts,
  passages, ambushes and sinister private rooms is still the delight of our
  popular romancers; it loses nothing in elaboration as it recedes into the
  past.</p>

  <p>The psychology of the twentieth-century policeman has been made the
  subject of a whole group of historical studies. There was no connection in
  those days between the policeman and either the educational or medical
  services. This association which appears so inevitable to us today would have
  seemed insane to the organizers of the first police forces in the eighteenth
  and nineteenth centuries. The policeman, for them, was to be an animated
  barrier and signpost, capable of leaping into action at the sight of assault,
  petty larceny or unseemly behaviour. Beyond that very little initiative was
  expected from him. He took into custody people who were "given in charge".
  Above him were officers, usually of a different class, and associated with
  the force was a group of criminal enquiry experts, who were quite capable of
  handling most of the offences against the law that prevailed in the era
  before the extensive introduction of rapid transit, power machinery and mass
  production. This pattern of police force worked fairly well up to the
  beginning of the twentieth century. Except in districts where sexual
  prostitution was rife it remained fairly honest. It maintained a fairly high
  level of liberty, security of property and social order for a century. Only
  when the control of morals or political intervention was thrust upon it did
  it prove unequal to the strain.</p>

  <p>And then, as the greater community of the World State began to struggle
  clumsily and painfully out of traditional forms, we see police control again
  outpaced by its task. It gives way. "Why," the student asks, "was this police
  organization unable to keep pace with the new stresses? Why were the ruling
  people of that time so incapable of fitting it to the new demands upon it?"
  We have already indicated the main lines of the answer. Just when the need
  for a fundamental refashioning of the police of the world was becoming
  urgent, came also, first that exacerbation of international hostilities, of
  "secret service" and espionage to render any broad international handling of
  the problem impossible, and secondly that desperately foolish sacrifice of
  life to the creditor which seems to be the inevitable conclusion of any
  social system based on acquisition.</p>

  <p>The Profit-Capitalist System was absolutely incapable of controlling the
  unemployment it had evoked and the belligerence it stimulated. It stagnated
  on its hoards. It fought against inflation and it fought against taxation. It
  died frothing economies at the mouth. It killed the schools on which public
  acquiescence rested. Impartially it restricted employment and the relief of
  the unemployed. Even on this plain issue of its police protection it
  economized. Impossible, it said, to plan a new police when we cannot even pay
  for the police we have.</p>

  <p>And so the desperate fight of an essentially nineteenth-century pattern of
  police organization, under-financed, inadequately equipped, divided up,
  controlled by small-scale, antiquated national or parochial authorities, in
  many cases rotten with corruption, against the monstrous forces of
  disorganization released by the irregular hypertrophies to social development
  was added to the other conflicts of that distressful age.</p>

  <p>In spite of a notable amount of corruption and actual descents into
  criminality, the general will of most of the police forces seems to have
  remained sound. Most but not all. Most of these organizations did keep up a
  fight for order even when they were in a process of dissolution. They did
  keep up their traditional war against crime. But their methods underwent a
  considerable degeneration, which was shared, and shared for the same reason,
  by the criminal law of the period. Police and prosecutor both felt that the
  dice were loaded against them, that they were battling against unfair odds.
  Their war against crime became a feud. It grew less and less like a serene
  control, and more and more like a gang conflict. They were working in an
  atmosphere in which witnesses were easily intimidated and local sympathy more
  often than not against the law. This led to an increasing unscrupulousness on
  their part in the tendering and treatment of evidence. In many cases (see
  Aubrey Wilkinson's The Natural History of the Police Frame-up, 1991) the
  police deliberately manufactured evidence against criminals they had good
  reason to believe guilty, and perjured themselves unhesitatingly. Wilkinson
  declares that in the early twentieth century hundreds of thousands of
  wrongdoers were "justly condemned on false evidence", and that they could
  have been condemned in no other way.</p>

  <p>But the apologetics of Wilkinson for the police break down when he comes
  to the next aspect of their degeneration under stress. We have all read with
  horror of the use of torture in mediaeval practice and shuddered at the fact
  that there were even special machines and instruments in those days, the
  rack, the thumbscrew, the boot and so forth, for the infliction of pain. But
  there remains little doubt now that the police of the twentieth century,
  fighting with their backs to the wall against enormous odds, did go very far
  towards a revival of torture against those they believed to be social
  dangers. It is a difficult as well as an ugly task to disentangle this story
  now, but sufficient fact emerges to show us that in the general decay of
  behaviour that was going on, not merely casual blows and roughness of
  handling, but the systematic exhaustion, pestering, ill-treatment and actual
  torment of persons under arrest in order to extort confessions and
  incriminating statements, became prevalent.</p>

  <p>There is no real distinction in nature between the processes that led up
  to this chaotic nucleation of human beings about gangs and organizations for
  frankly criminal purposes and those which led to protective associations for
  the illegal maintenance of security and order and again to those much wider
  allegiances within the state such as the nationalist Sokols in the Austrian
  provinces that became Szecho Slovakia, the Irish Republican organizations,
  the Ku Klux Klan in America, the multitudinous secret societies of India,
  China, and Japan, the Communist Party which captured Russia, the Fascist who
  captured Italy, the Nazis who captured Germany, all of which pursued on
  bolder and bolder scales large intimidatory and revolutionary economic and
  political ends. All these were structurally great gangster systems. Instead
  of specific immediate blackmail they sought larger satisfactions; that is all
  the difference. Even when the organisation as a whole had large conceptions
  of its function, it was apt to degenerate locally into a mere boss or bully
  rule. All these forms of recrystallization within the community, large and
  small, arose because of the inadaptability and want of vigour and cooperation
  in the formal governing, economically directive and educational systems.
  Because there was no foresight to ensure continuity in the growth of
  institutions, there were these unpremeditated and often morbid growths,
  expressive of the accumulating discomfort and discontent and of the need for
  a more intimate, energetic and fruitful form of human association.</p>

  <p>It is paradoxical but true that the civilized human society of the later
  nineteenth and earlier twentieth centuries broke up because of the imperative
  need of human beings to live in active combination. It was pulled to pieces
  by its own new cohesions. Until there was a complete, satisfactory and
  vigorous World-State organization potentially in being, the continuation of
  this breaking up and reassembling of social energy was inevitable. It was
  like the break-up of caterpillar organs in the cocoon to form the new
  structures of the imago.</p>

  <p>Even the Modern State Fellowship itself, so far as many of its nuclei were
  concerned, was at first of this nature, a coalescence of all these varied
  technicians who realized that employment would vanish, that everything they
  valued in life would vanish, with the spread of social disorder. They
  constituted protective and aggressive gangs with an unexampled power of
  world-wide cooperation. Their confluence became the new world.</p>

  <p>The demoralization of the world's sea life, thanks to the surviving
  vestiges of naval power, was far less rapid and complete than the spread of
  disorder on the land. It was only after the series of naval mutinies towards
  the end of the last European war that the ancient practice of piracy was
  resumed. Even then ships could still be policed and a recalcitrant ship
  brought to book much more easily than the black streets of a town. One or two
  pleasure liners were boarded and held up in out-of-the-way ports in the
  thirties, but in no case did the assailants get away with their plunder. In
  1933 the Chinese fleet had disintegrated into shipfuls of adventurers
  offering their services by wireless to the various governments who divided
  the country. But these stray warships did little mischief before they were
  bought, captured or sunk by the Japanese.</p>

  <p>A Canadian pleasure liner, The King of the Atlantic, on one of the last
  holiday voyages to be made, was seized on the high seas by an armed gang in
  1939, and an attempt was made to hold its passengers to ransom. They were all
  to be killed if the pursuit was pressed home. In the face, however, of a
  combined attack by American sea and air forces, at that time still efficient
  though greatly in arrears with their pay, the hearts of the gangsters failed
  them and they surrendered ignominiously.</p>

  <p>No ship of over 9,000 tons was ever captured by pirates. This relative
  maintenance of orderliness at sea was due to special conditions&mdash;the
  then recent discovery of radio communications, for example. It outlasted the
  practical cessation of shipbuilding in the forties and an immense shrinkage
  in the world's shipping.</p>

  <p>Nor did new types of criminal appear in the air until after the third
  European conflict, and then not overwhelmingly. Here again was a field of
  human activity, essentially simple and controllable. For a time indeed the
  aeroplane was the safest as well as the swiftest method of getting about the
  world. For some years after the practical cessation of general land travel
  the infrequent aviator still hummed across the sky, over dangerous city and
  deserted highroad, over ruined country houses and abandoned cultivations,
  recalling the memory of former disciplines and the promise of an orderly
  future.</p>

  <p>There were fewer aeroplanes just as there were fewer ships, and, because
  of the general discouragement of enterprise, there was little change of type,
  yet the skies, like the high seas, remained practically outside the range of
  the general social debacle until well past the middle of the century. The
  need for aerodromes, for repairing and fuelling, held the dwindling body of
  aviators together. Air outrages at the worst phase were still scattered and
  disconnected events. And it was in the air at last and along the air routes
  that the sword of a new order reappeared.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap2_04"
     name="chap2_04">4. &mdash; CHANGES IN WAR PRACTICE AFTER THE WORLD
     WAR</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The science and practice of warfare during this Age of
  Frustration, having now no adequate directing and controlling forces over it,
  pursued, in its development, a preposterous and dreadful logic of its
  own.</p>

  <p>In 1914, at the outbreak of the World War, military science had been a
  pretentious and backward lore. The War Offices, as we have told, had allowed
  the armament industry to put enormously outsize weapons into their hands, but
  they had made none of the necessary mental adjustments needed to meet this
  change of scale. All the land commanders engaged in that struggle with
  scarcely an exception were still fighting clumsily according to the obsolete
  tradition of nineteenth-century warfare. They were still thinking in terms of
  frontal attack, outflanking, the break-through and so-forth. We have told as
  briefly as we could the horrors of the ensuing harvest. The Admiralties,
  forewarned perhaps by their engineers, showed a livelier discretion and for
  the most part hid away their costly fleets from the disasters of combat in
  strongly defended harbours, and allowed them to emerge only on one or two
  wild occasions for battle so inconclusive that they were prolonged as
  controversies for years afterwards and remain undecided to this day. The
  submarine, the minefield, the aeroplane, the primitive "tank", organized
  propaganda to weaken war will, a tentative use of gas, and the replacement of
  many of the elder commanders as the war proceeded did something to modify
  land fighting, but to the very last, when the general collapse of "morale"
  led to the armistice, the professional soldiers were clinging to the idea
  that nothing fundamental had happened to the methods of their ancient and
  honoured profession.</p>

  <p>All this changed after the Peace of Versailles. A spirit of unrest entered
  into both the War Offices and Foreign Offices of the world. They were invaded
  by a consciousness of great changes none the less potent because it was
  belated and had accumulated. The younger generals who had been through the
  war could not put out of their minds memories of attacks from overhead, gas
  attacks, tank actions, and, above all, the loose ungentlemanly comments of
  temporary officers of practical ability and unmilitary habits of mind. These
  younger generals aged in their turn, and as they aged they succeeded to
  positions of authority. They came into power repeating perpetually: "We must
  keep pace with the times."</p>

  <p>A phase of extreme innovation succeeded the conservatism of the older
  generation. Everywhere the War Offices stirred with novel conceptions of
  strange inventions, secret novelties and furtive systematic research.
  Everywhere the obscure reports of spies and informants, carefully fostered by
  the armament dealers affected, stimulated this forced inventiveness.</p>

  <p>It was realized that the old warfare had in fact perished in a state of
  lumpish hypertrophy in the trenches. It had indeed been a "war to end
  war"&mdash; and the old war was done for. The new warfare had to replace
  it&mdash;and quickly. The Foreign Offices demanded it. They could not do
  without war of some sort. Sovereignty was war. The traditional state was an
  organization against foreigners resting on the ultimate sanction of
  belligerence. They could imagine no other state of affairs, for to begin with
  that would have involved imagining themselves non-existent. The thirties and
  forties of the century teemed with furtive and grotesquely hideous researches
  to discover and develop the methods of the New Warfare. For the only
  alternative to further war was the abandonment of state sovereignty, and for
  that men's minds were altogether unprepared.</p>

  <p>The changes in war method that went on between 1900 and 1950 C.E., with
  the possible exception of the introduction of firearms between the twelfth
  and sixteenth centuries, were far greater than anything that had ever
  happened since the earliest men hit and scuffled in their first rude group
  encounters. For endless ages the main conflict had been the "battle", the
  encounter of bodies of men on foot or on horseback. The infantry had been the
  traditional backbone of the army, and (except when the Huns and the Mongols
  refused to play according to the rules) the cavalry was secondary. Artillery
  was used only for "preparation" before the attack. So fought Rameses, so
  Alexander, so Caesar, so Napoleon. The glorious victories during the romantic
  ages of human warfare all amounted to battles of practically the same
  pattern, to a great central battering with pikes, swords, bayonets, maces or
  suchlike implements, a swiping, pushing, punching, pelting, stabbing, poking
  and general clapperclawing amidst a shower of comparatively light missiles,
  that went on at longest for a few hours, and ended in a break, a flight, a
  cavalry pursuit and a massacre. This "open warfare" alternated, it is true,
  with long sieges, less sportsmanlike phases, in which the contending hosts
  refused battle and squatted unwholesomely in excavations and behind walls,
  annoying each other by raids and attempts to storm and break through, until
  hunger, pestilence, the decay of discipline under boredom, or the
  exasperation of the surrounding population broke up the party. Non-combatants
  suffered considerable temporary and incidental molestation during warfare,
  there was a certain amount of raping and looting, devastation to destroy
  supplies, pressed labour and spy-hunting on a scale which amounted in most
  cases to little more than an exacerbation of normal criminality. Wholesale
  devastation, such as the break-up of the irrigation of Mesopotamia by the
  Mongols, or the laying waste of Northumbria by William the Conqueror of
  England, was, when it occurred, a measure of policy rather than a war
  measure. War had to go on for many decades before it could produce such
  disorganisation as that of Asia Minor in the wars between Byzantium and
  Persia. The Islamic invasions were at first made additionally disagreeable by
  religious propaganda, but this was speedily replaced by discriminatory
  taxation. The long distance campaigns of Roman, Hunnish and Mongol armies
  again spread various once localized infectious and contagious diseases very
  widely; but the total influence of the old warfare upon human destiny was
  enormously exaggerated by the nationalist historians of the old régime. It
  was of infinitely less importance than migration. The peasant life went on
  unchangingly, squalid and laborious, as it had been going on for the majority
  of human beings since agriculture began. The various "Decisive Battles of the
  World" were high points in that fantasy of the pedants, the great "drama of
  the empires", with which they befogged the human mind for so long during its
  gropings from the peasant state of life towards a sane and orderly way of
  living.</p>

  <p>But with the Napoleonic wars, the soldier began to invade and modify the
  texture of normal life as he had never done before, by conscription, by
  unprecedented monetary levies, indemnities and taxes that dislocated economic
  processes; and conversely, quite uninvited by the soldier, as we have shown,
  the expanding forces of power industrialism and of mass manipulation through
  journalistic and other sorts of propaganda, invaded both the military field
  and the common life. War, which had been like the superficial ploughing of
  our ancestors, became a subsoil plough, an excavator that went deeper and
  deeper, that began presently to deflect underground springs and prepare
  extensive landslides.</p>

  <p>The Generals of the World War were all in the position of inexperienced
  amateurs in charge of vast mechanisms beyond their power of control. War,
  which formerly had been fought on the flat along a "front", suddenly reached
  through and over the contending armies, and allowed no one to stand out of it
  any more. The New Warfare, it was already being remarked by 1918, was a war
  of whole populations, from which all respect for the non-combatant was
  vanishing. People said this, and some few even tried to understand in detail
  what it meant. And now all over the world military gentlemen, many of them
  still adorned with the spurs, epaulettes, froggings, buttons, stripes,
  ribbons, medals, residual scraps of armour and suchlike pretty glories of the
  good old times, set themselves most valiantly to work out the possibilities
  and methods of the New Warfare.</p>

  <p>Courage was always the better part of the military tradition, and nothing
  could exceed the courage with which these men set themselves throughout this
  period to overtake the march of invention, to master engineering and
  engineers, chemistry and chemists, war correspondents and newspaper editors,
  biology, medicine, and even finance, in their efforts to keep that ancient
  war idea, the idea of the battling sovereign state, alive. As we have seen,
  the schools stood loyally by them; they had the support of the armament
  industries, and, less whole-heartedly perhaps, the approval of the old
  religions and of the old royalties and loyalties. Their activities were
  profoundly stupid, but the grotesque horror of their achievements, the
  distress and unhappiness of three generations of our race, are still recent
  enough to mask their ludicrous quality.</p>

  <p>The literature of the military science of this period is a copious one,
  and perhaps the best survey of it all is Fuller-Metsch's The Ideas of the New
  Warfare in the Middle Twentieth Century (2001). Therein the writer sets
  himself to three enquiries: "For what did they suppose they were going to
  fight?" "How were they going to fight?" And "What did they consider would
  constitute a definitive end and winding-up of their fighting?"</p>

  <p>The answer he gives is a composite one. No single individual seems to have
  grasped the New Warfare in its entirety. With a solemn pedantry, a
  pretentious modesty, each "expert" dealt with his own department and left it
  to Fate to put the assembled parts together into a whole. But what the
  composite soldier of 1935 was contemplating rather foggily seems to have been
  very much as follows. He conceived the world as divided up among a number of
  governments or Powers. These were the sovereign states as the Treaty of
  Westphalia (1642) presented them. All these powers were competitive and
  passively or actively hostile. The intervals when the hostility was active
  were wars. The intervals of recuperation and preparation were peace. War was
  a cessation of a truce between the belligerents, a cessation arising out of
  an irreconcilable dispute or clash of interests, and the objective then of
  each Power was to impose its Will upon its enemy. In the days before the
  twentieth century this imposition of Will was done more or less
  professionally by the governments and armies. One or other Power took the
  offensive, crossed its borders and marched on the enemy seat of government.
  After various operations and battles the capital would be captured or the
  invader driven back to his own, and a peace made and a treaty signed more or
  less in accordance with the Will of the victor. Boundaries would be adjusted
  in accordance with that Will, colonies transferred, indemnities arranged for;
  the victorious Power expanded and the defeated shrivelled. The people of the
  unsuccessful Power would be very much ashamed of themselves. To the end of
  the nineteenth century this formula was observed.</p>

  <p>But by the time of the World War much more than the disappearance of the
  "front" and the increasing entanglement of the erstwhile non-combatants was
  happening to this procedure. The Powers were losing their definite
  identities. The fine question of what constituted a responsible government
  capable of imposing a Will, or giving in to it, arose. In Russia, for
  example, was the new Communist régime responsible for the obligations of the
  Autocracy? Was Germany, were all the Germans, to be held responsible for
  Krupp-Kaiser militarism? Was a dummy Sultan in Constantinople, or Kemal Pasha
  in Angora, the proper authority to consent to the dismemberment of Turkey?
  Again, the United States of America had come gaily into the war and then
  declined effective participation in President Wilson's settlement. He had
  not, it seemed, been a plenipotentiary. Was that behaving as a Power should
  behave?</p>

  <p>Still further perplexities arose about the laws of war. If the front was
  abolished, if civilians were to be bombed from the air, what became of the
  right of professional soldiers to shoot franc-tireurs and destroy their
  homes? It was as if the arena of a football match were invaded by the
  spectators, who began kicking the ball about, chasing the referee, and
  declining to keep any score as between the original sides in the game.</p>

  <p>The military authority recoiled from these devastating riddles of the new
  age. Such issues, he decided, were not for him. There had always been sides
  in a war, and there must still be sides. It was for the politicians to define
  them. He fell back on his fundamental conception of a Power "imposing its
  Will" upon another Power, but using now, in addition to the old invasion and
  march on the capital, the new methods of propaganda, blockades and attacks
  behind the front, and all the latest chemical and aerial devices to
  "undermine the morale" of the enemy population and dispose its government to
  yield. In the end there must be a march, if only a concluding professional
  march, through the goal or capital of the losing side. He refused to
  entertain the inevitable problem of an enemy government not yielding but
  collapsing, and leaving no responsible successor. That was not his affair.
  Presumably in that case the war would continue indefinitely.</p>

  <p>Nor was it his business to enter into the financial aspects of the matter,
  to estimate any ratio whatever between the costs of the New Warfare and the
  material advantages to be exacted when the Will of the conqueror was imposed.
  In that regard he was excessively modest. He could not be expected to think
  of everything. His business was to prepare the best and most thorough war
  possible, with all the latest improvements, and quite regardless of cost, for
  his Power. It was for his government to find out how to pay for and use the
  war he had prepared for it. Or to use it partially. War, just war itself, was
  the limit of his task.</p>

  <p>Research for the latest improvements soon led the now almost morbidly
  progressive military mind to some horrifying discoveries. Some of the
  soldiers concerned were certainly badly scared by the realization of what
  evils it was now possible to inflict in warfare. It leaked out in their
  speeches and books. But they kept on. They kept on partly because they had a
  stout-hearted tradition and refused to be dismayed, but mainly no doubt for
  the same reason that the Christian priests and bishops who had lost their
  faith still stuck to their Churches&mdash;because it was the only job they
  could do. Throughout the three decades that followed the Congress of
  Versailles, thousands of highly intelligent men, specialist soldiers, air
  soldiers, engineering soldiers, chemical, medical soldiers and the like, a
  far ampler and more energetic personnel than that devoted to the solution of
  the much more urgent and important financial riddles of the time, were
  working out, with unstinted endowments and the acquiescence and approval of
  their prospective victims, patiently, skilfully, thoroughly, almost
  inconceivably, abominable novelties for the surprise and torture of human
  beings.</p>

  <p>None of these experts seems to have been more than mediocre; it was an age
  of mental and moral mediocrities; and even within the accepted limitation we
  have already noted, none of them seems to have worked out the New Warfare as
  a whole complete process. Groups of men working in secrecy, immune from outer
  criticism, naturally conspire not only against the foreigner but against each
  other, and most of the men in decisive positions were rather men skilled in
  securing appointments and promotion than inspired specialists. A certain
  lumbering quality in their devices ensued.</p>

  <p>In Great Britain a group of these experts became exceedingly busy in what
  was called mechanical warfare. The British had first invented, and then made
  a great mess of, the tank in the World War, and they were a tenacious people.
  The authorities stuck to it belatedly but doggedly. In a time of deepening
  and ever bitterer parsimony their War Office spared no expense in this
  department. It was the last of all to feel the pinch. The funny land
  ironclads of all sizes these military "inventors" produced, from a sort of
  armoured machine-gunner on caterpillar wheels up to very considerable mobile
  forts, are still among the queerest objects in the sheds of the vast war
  dumps which constitute the Aldershot Museum. They are fit peers for Admiral
  Fisher's equally belated oil Dreadnoughts.</p>

  <p>The British dream of the next definitive war seems to have involved a
  torrent of this ironmongery tearing triumphantly across Europe. In some magic
  way (too laborious to think out) these armoured Wurms were to escape traps,
  gas poison belts, mines and gunfire. There were even "tanks" that were
  intended to go under water, and some that could float. Hansen even declared
  (see The Last War Preparations, xxiv, 1076) that he had found (rejected)
  plans of tanks to fly and burrow. Most of these contrivances never went into
  action. That throws a flavour of genial absurdity over this particular
  collection that is sadly lacking from most war museums.</p>

  <p>The British and the French experts, and presently the Germans, also worked
  very hard at the fighting aeroplane&mdash;the British and Germans with the
  greatest success; the aerial torpedo, controllable at immense distances, was
  perfected almost simultaneously by the Italians and the Japanese. The French
  mind, for all its native brilliance, was hampered by its characteristic
  reluctance to scrap old plant for new. It was the German, American and
  Russian experts who went furthest with the possibilities of chemical attack.
  The disarmament of Germany necessarily forced its military authorities to
  concentrate on an arm that could be studied, experimented upon and prepared
  unknown to the outer world, and the Russians were forced to take up parallel
  enquiries because of their relative industrial poverty. The Germans had been
  first to use gas in the Great War, and they remained for a long time the war
  gas pioneers. But after the Great War much attention was given to this arm in
  America through the influence of the chemical industry. Biological warfare,
  that is to say the distribution of infectious diseases, was also extensively
  studied, America and the Central Europeans in this case leading the way.</p>

  <p>Even before the Central European fighting in 1940 and the subsequent
  years, the distribution of various disease germs was no longer a merely
  theoretical possibility. Little containers, made to look like fountain pens,
  were already being manufactured. The caps could be removed to expose soluble
  ends, and then they could be dropped into reservoirs or running streams.
  Glass bombs also existed for use from aeroplanes, railway-train windows and
  so forth, which would break on hitting water. There are specimens in the
  Aldershot Museum. The enrolment and territorial organization of medical men
  and trained assistants to inoculate threatened populations went on with
  increasing vigour after 1932.</p>

  <p>But there was a certain hesitation about the use of disease germs. It is
  easy to distribute them but hard to limit their field of action, and if
  prisoners (military or civilian) were still to be taken and towns and
  territory occupied, a well launched pestilence might conceivably recoil with
  deadly effect upon its users. Bacterial warfare seemed, even to the
  specialists who studied it, a very improbable method for any but an
  heroically vindictive population in the hour of defeat. Nevertheless it was
  thought best to have it worked out. Except for the distribution of malignant
  influenza in Kan-su and Shensi by the Japanese during their efforts to
  tranquillize North China in 1936, "without proceeding to extremities", its
  use was never officially admitted. Other alleged instances of its deliberate
  employment by responsible Powers have been shown by the researches of the
  Historical Bureau to have been due either to the unauthorized zeal of
  subordinates or to the activities of those religious fanatics who became so
  prevalent during the period of confusion after 1945. The acclimatization of
  the mosquito transmitting yellow fever in India in 1950, which did so much to
  diminish the population of that peninsula, has never been explained. It is
  generally supposed to have been accidental.</p>

  <p>So far as method and invention went, what was called "Gas Warfare" ran
  very parallel to bacterial warfare. Its beginning and end is now a closed
  chapter in the history of the human intelligence and will. It is surely one
  of the strangest. It set its stamp upon the clothing and urban architecture
  of the age. It ranks in horror with the story of judicial torture or the
  story of ritual cannibalism, but its inhumanity is more striking because of
  its nearness to our own times. Like those older instances, it brings home to
  us the supreme need for sound common general ideas to hold together human
  activities. It tells how thousands of clear and active minds, each
  indisputably sane, could, in an atmosphere obsessed by plausible false
  assumptions about patriotic duty and honour, cooperate to produce a combined
  result fantastically futile and cruel.</p>

  <p>The people engaged in this business were, on the whole, exceptionally
  grave, industrious and alert-minded. Could they revisit the world to-day
  individually we should probably find them all respectable, companionable,
  intelligible persons. Yet in the aggregate they amounted to an organization
  of dangerous lunatics. They inflicted dreadful deaths, hideous sufferings or
  tormented lives upon, it is estimated, about a million of their fellow
  creatures.</p>

  <p>Most of the lethal substances prepared for gas warfare purposes have
  passed altogether out of general knowledge. They are either never
  manufactured now or they are produced upon rare occasions and under proper
  control for the purposes of physiological research. The old devices and
  appliances for their distribution seem, nowadays, like grotesque
  anticipations of many of the features of the large scale agricultural and
  hygienic operations that are carried out to-day. The treatment of locust
  swarms by air attack, the spraying of the reafforested regions against
  various tree diseases, the regular cleansing and stimulation of our grain and
  root crops are all subsequent rationalizations of these practices of the Age
  of Frustration.</p>

  <p>Faber, that Calvinistic optimist, with his doctrine that the bad is all to
  the good in this maddest of all conceivable worlds, thinks that all these big
  scale methods were "enormously stimulated" by the crazy inventiveness of the
  war period. But then he has also suggested that the aeroplane would not have
  come into general use for many years without war stimulation. We venture to
  think he carries his doctrine of the attainment of wisdom through imbecility
  too far. It is really only a modernization of Charles Lamb's story of the
  invention of the roast pig. It had the touch of Rasputinism, this revival of
  the ancient heresy that one must sin THOROUGHLY before one can be saved.</p>

  <p>Much more after the gas-war pattern were the campaigns (2033 and 2035)
  against rats and mice, that finally cleansed the world of the lurking poison
  of that medieval terror, bubonic plague, and the distributions of "festivity
  gas", that were permitted in various regions in 2060. The countervailing use
  of benign-gases as a subsidiary to the suppression of the depressing cometary
  toxins of 2080 will also occur to the reader. The oxygenation of council
  chambers, factories, playing-fields and similar loci demanding special
  brightness and activity, and the use of Padanath Tagore's Lotus Gas in the
  Himalayan rest valleys, we may note, are also claimed by Faber as part of the
  legacy of gas warfare.</p>

  <p>One or two of the offensive substances actually manufactured for war
  purposes are now utilized in relation to very special and specially protected
  processes in our industrial plants. The preparation of some of them is a
  major felony. They were a very various miscellany, for every chemical
  possibility was ransacked to find them. Very few of them were actually gases.
  Many were volatile liquids or even finely divided solids, which were to be
  sprayed or dusted over positions in enemy occupation. Dr. Gertrud Woker, in a
  paper on this subject contributed to an enquiry by the Interparliamentary
  Union in 1931, gave a useful summary of the existing state of knowledge at
  that time. In conjunction with various colleagues (What Would Be the
  Character of a New War? Historical Documents 937,205), she allows us to form
  an estimate of what was actually being contemplated by contemporary military
  experts. Except for one important exception, her list covers all the main
  types of poison gas substances that were actually prepared. This spate of
  investigation culminated about 1938. By that time the entire field had been
  explored. After that there were improvements but no major innovations.</p>

  <p>After 1940 even military research was restricted by the increasing
  financial paralysis. In 1960 no plants capable of producing material for gas
  warfare on a sufficiently abundant scale were operating.</p>

  <p>Of gases actually tried out in the World War itself, the chief seem to
  have been chlorine and various chlorine compounds (phosgene, Green Cross gas,
  chloropicrin and so forth). These attacked and destroyed the lung tissue.
  Chlorine was used by the Germans as early as April 1915 at Ypres when 6,000
  men were killed by it; it was soon abandoned, because it was so immediately
  irritating that its presence was detected at once, and precautionary measures
  could be taken. The other gases in this class got to work less frankly.
  Presently the victim began to cough. Then as the destruction of the
  bronchioles and alveoli of the lungs went on he retched and suffocated and
  coughed up blood and tissue. He died amidst his expectorations with a visage
  blue and bloated and bloodstained froth on his lips. If by good luck he
  survived, he survived with his lungs so injured that he easily fell a victim
  to tuberculosis or suchlike disease. Most of this group of gases had their
  own characteristic complications. One series, for instance, would attack the
  nervous system, causing wild excitement, terror, convulsions, screams and
  paralysis. Thousands of men had already died in agony from Green Cross gas
  during the World War, and the plans of some of these experts involved the
  massacre of whole populations in the same atrocious fashion. Green Cross gas
  was used, but not in sufficient strength to be very deadly, in the Polish
  bombing of Berlin in May 1940, and in a more concentrated form in the aerial
  torpedoes that were sent from Germany to Warsaw. It had been used also at
  Nankin in 1935 and in the Chinese reprisal at Osaka.</p>

  <p>Yellow Cross gas, or mustard gas, was much more insidious and also more
  cruel and murderous. It was not really a gas; it was a volatile liquid. When
  cold, it spread unsuspected in a thin film over the ground, getting on to
  boots and clothing, being carried hither and thither. Slowly, as it
  vaporized, its presence was revealed. Discomfort came, a horrible suspicion,
  fear and then coughing and retching. It involved quite frightful and hopeless
  suffering. Steadily but surely it killed every living substance with which it
  came into contact; it burnt it, blistered it, rotted it away. One part of
  mustard gas in five million of air was sufficient to affect the lungs. It ate
  into the skin, inflamed the eyes; it turned the muscles into decaying tissue.
  It became a creeping disease of the body, enfeebling every function, choking,
  suffocating. It is doubtful if any of those affected by it were ever
  completely cured. Its maximum effect was rapid torture and death; its minimum
  prolonged misery and an abbreviated life. The gases used in the fighting in
  North China in 1934-37 and in the Chinese raids upon Japan were mostly of
  this group. And an evacuation of Berlin in 1946 was brought about by the
  threat of Yellow Cross bombs.</p>

  <p>[They were actually dropped, but either through accident or by the
  insubordination of the chemists employed by the Poles, they smashed
  ineffectively. It was one of the most striking instances of what appears to
  have been the pacificist sabotage that helped to end the formal warfare in
  Central Europe. Five of the chemical workers concerned were shot and
  seventeen given long sentences of imprisonment, but none of the records of
  their trial has survived.]</p>

  <p>Allied rather than competing with these gases of the Green and Yellow
  Cross categories, Dr. Woker cites the Blue Cross group. These substances were
  essentially direct nervous irritants in the form of an almost impalpable
  dust. They could penetrate most of the gas masks then in use, and produced
  such pain, so violent a sneezing and nausea, and such a loss of self-control
  that the victim would tear off his mask, so exposing himself to the Green or
  Yellow vapours with which Blue Cross was usually associated.</p>

  <p>All these torments had been extensively inflicted already during the World
  War, but after its conclusion the secret activities of the various poison gas
  departments were sustained with great energy. It took them nearly twenty
  years even to open up the main possibilities of their speciality. One
  substance, which played a large part in the discussions of the time, was
  "Lewisite", the discovery of a Professor Lewis of Chicago, which came too
  late for actual use before the end of 1918. This was one of a group or
  arsenical compounds. One part of it in ten millions of air was sufficient to
  put a man out of action. It was inodorous, tasteless; you only knew you had
  it when it began to work upon you. It blistered as much as mustard gas and
  produced a violent sickness.</p>

  <p>Other war poisons followed upon this invention, still more deadly:
  merciful poisons that killed instantly and cruel and creeping poisons that
  implacably rotted the brain. Some produced convulsions and a knotting up of
  the muscles a hundred times more violent than the once dreaded tetanus. There
  is a horrible suggestiveness in the description of the killing of a flock of
  goats for experimental purposes in these researches: "All succumbed to the
  effect of the gas except three, which dashed their brains out against the
  enclosure." And to assist these chemicals in their task of what Dr. Woker
  calls "mass murder" there was a collateral research into incendiary
  substances and high explosives, to shatter and burn any gas attack shelter to
  which a frightened crowd might resort.</p>

  <p>Dr. Woker's summary does not include Kovoet's invention of the permanent
  Death Gas in 1934. Its composition is still a secret and its very complicated
  preparation a felony. This compound, although not absolutely permanent,
  decomposed with extreme slowness. It was in itself neither a gas nor a
  poison. It was a heavy, rather coarse-grained powder. It evaporated as
  camphor does, and as it evaporated it combined with oxygen to form a poison
  effective when diluted with fifty million times its volume of air. Its action
  was essentially of the Lewisite type. This was actually used in the first
  Polish War to cut off East Prussia. A zone of territory from a mile to three
  miles wide along the whole frontier was evacuated and dusted with Permanent
  Death Gas. East Prussia became a peninsula accessible only from Lithuania or
  by sea. In spite of the heaviness of the grains, the winds finally widened
  this band of death to about fifteen miles in width and carried its lethal
  influence into the suburbs of Danzig.</p>

  <p>This murdered region was not re-entered, except by a few specially masked
  explorers, until after 1960, and then it was found to be littered with the
  remains not only of the human beings, cattle and dogs who had strayed into
  it, but with the skeletons and scraps of skin and feathers of millions of
  mice, rats, birds and suchlike small creatures. In some places they lay
  nearly a metre deep. War Pictures has two photographs of this strange
  deposit. Vegetation was not so completely destroyed; trees died and remained
  bare and pickled; some grasses suffered, but others of the ranker sort
  flourished, and great areas were covered by a carpet of dwarfed and stunted
  corn-cockles and elecampane set in grey fluff.</p>

  <p>A curious by-product of Permanent Death Gas is what is now known as the
  Sterilizing Inhalation. This was first made by accident. A Chinese
  Vindication Society organized an air raid on Osaka and Tokio in 1935 after
  the great Green Cross raid on Nankin in that year. It was intended to strike
  terror into the Japanese mind. Permanent Death Powder was to have been used,
  but because of the haste and danger of the preparations the Chinese had not
  tested it out, and here again, either by accident or design, things went
  wrong; the formula, it seems, had been falsified. Consequently, when the raid
  was made&mdash;all the machines employed were brought down on their way
  home&mdash;nothing ensued but a temporary fever accompanied by retching and
  purging.</p>

  <p>There was much derision of the unfortunate aviators in Japan. It was only
  some months after that the Western World learnt that the medical services of
  both towns were reporting a complete cessation of early pregnancies. Not a
  litter of kittens or puppies had appeared for weeks, mares were no longer
  foaling nor cows in calf. Mice and rats vanished. The sterilization in all
  cases was permanent. But birds were not affected for reasons that Crayford-
  Huxley has since made clear. The sparrows multiplied enormously and the hens
  still clucked triumphantly in these childless cities.</p>

  <p>In some way the Chinese chemists had blundered upon one of those rare sub-
  radiant gases known as Pabst's Kinetogens, which affect the genes. A whole
  series of these are now known to biologists, chiefly through the work of
  Pabst and his assistants, and most of the more extraordinary flower sports
  and new aberrant animal types in our experimental gardens are due to their
  employment; but for a long time, until indeed Pabst took up the subject with
  an insight all his own, only the Sterilization Inhalation was known. Most of
  the campaigns in the Forties of the twenty-first century against contagious
  rodents made an extensive use of this gas wherever regions could be isolated
  from human intrusion, and the day may not be distant when it will have
  important eugenic applications.</p>

  <p>But the Japanese experience produced even a greater sensation throughout
  the world than the actual slaughter of the victims would have occasioned. The
  militarist class in Japan was as deeply sentimental as the Western equivalent
  in Europe, and as resolute that the common people should not only die but
  breed fresh battle fodder for their country. Until the patriots realized that
  the Chinese supply of this stuff was limited, they lived in horror. They saw
  themselves stripped bare of subject lives. They saw themselves extinct in the
  hour of victory. There was a great clamour about the world for the extensive
  application of this new find during the fiercer war years; there are
  proposals on record (Hate Eugenics, Historical Documents 5752890 and seq.) to
  apply it from the air to Palestine, Arabia, Ireland, the whole of China and
  the African Continent in part or as a whole. But mankind was saved from any
  such catastrophe by the fact that the first production of Sterilizing
  Inhalation was essentially accidental. It had been prepared furtively, its
  makers were untraceable, and the proper formula was not worked out and made
  controllable until our insane world was well in the grip of the harsh
  humanity of the Air Dictatorship.</p>

  <p>How all these hideous devices of the New Warfare were to be brought
  together to effect the definitive subjugation of the Will of a belligerent
  Power was apparently never thought out, or, if it was, the plans were kept so
  secret that now they have perished with their makers. After the millions had
  choked, after the cities were a stench of dead bodies&mdash;what then?</p>

  <p>Perhaps the artistic interest of the business precluded such remote
  considerations. All we can disentangle now of this gas warfare, as its
  experts contemplated it, consists of projects of mere mischief and torture.
  They seem imbued with much the same wanton destructiveness as that displayed
  by some of the younger specimens among the Loando-Mobi chimpanzee
  hybrids.</p>

  <p>Yet some of these plans are amazingly thorough up to a certain
  point&mdash;up to the point when one asks, "But WHY?" For instance, in the
  Marine War Museum in the Torcello Lagoon there are no fewer than half a dozen
  raider submarines built for four different great Powers, and all specially
  designed as long-distance bases for gas warfare. They carried no guns nor
  ordinary fighting equipment. They had practically unlimited cruising range,
  and within them from five to nine aeroplanes were packed with a formidable
  supply of gas bombs. One of them carried thirty long-range air torpedoes with
  all the necessary directional apparatus. There were four different types of
  gas mixture in the bombs, but they differed little in character and
  efficiency. The smallest of these raiders carried enough of such stuff to
  "prepare" about eight hundred square miles of territory. Completely
  successful, it could have turned most of the London or New York of that time,
  after some clamour and running and writhing and choking, into a cityful of
  distorted corpses. These vessels made London vulnerable from Japan, Tokio
  vulnerable from Dublin; they abolished the last corners of safety in the
  world.</p>

  <p>These six sinister monsters gleam now in the great gallery side by side,
  their poison fangs drawn, their mission abandoned, the grim vestiges, the
  uncontrovertible evidence of one nightmare among the many nightmares of hate
  and evil that afflicted the human brain during the Age of Frustration. There
  they are. Men made them&mdash;as men made the instruments of torture during
  the previous dark ages. Even amidst the happy confidence of our present life
  it is well that we should remember that, given different conditions, men
  technically as sane as ourselves could design and make these things.</p>

  <p>There is something revolting in these details. We have given enough for
  our purpose. History must not be made a feast of horror. From first to last
  gas warfare destroyed very painfully between one and one and a quarter
  million lives that might have been fruitful and happy. That much mischief was
  done. They suffered and they have gone. The gist of our story is that, after
  the humiliation and quickening of the military mind by the ineptitudes of the
  World War, belligerent science did not so much progress as lose itself in the
  multiplicity of its own inventions. It developed one frightful and monstrous
  contrivance after another, to dismay and torment mankind, to spread ill
  health and hate, to demoralize and destroy industrial life, to make whole
  countries uninhabitable and loosen every band that held men together in
  orderly societies, but it made no steps at all to any comprehensive and
  decisive conduct of war. With no plan for the future, with no vision of the
  world as a whole at all, these thousands of furtive specialists, these
  "damned ingenious patriots", as Isaac Burtonshaw (1913-2003) called them,
  went on accumulating, here frightful explosives, there stores of disgusting
  disease germs, and there again stores of this or that fantastically murderous
  gas.</p>

  <p>No comprehensive plan held any of these centres of evil together into one
  premeditated whole, as, for instance, the military preparations of the
  Hohenzollern Empire were held together by a clear and deliberate scheme of
  conclusive warfare. Beneath the vulgar monarchist claptrap of the German
  effort of 1914 there was indeed a real scheme for the reorganization and
  modernization of civilization about a Teutonic nucleus according to Teutonic
  ideals. It may have had its fatuous elements, but it was logical and
  complete. But war planning never recovered that completeness after 1914;
  never got back to the same logical foundations. After that belligerence lost
  its head. It still went on as everything else went on in those days&mdash;by
  inertia. But it had no longer any idea of what it was up to.</p>

  <p>Yet over all the world these incoherent mines were prepared, and they
  might well have exploded, had their release been simultaneous, into such an
  outbreak of disorderly evil as staggers the contemporary imagination. It is
  conceivable that they might have destroyed mankind. It would have needed no
  change in the essential conditions but only a rearrangement of the
  determining accidents to have brought about that final catastrophe.</p>

  <p>This menace of a chaos of disasters and aimless cruelties hung over a
  disorganized and unprotected world for three-quarters of a century. It is
  what some historians call the Period of Maximum Insecurity, from 1935 to
  1965. Here and there quite monstrous things occurred&mdash;at Nankin, Pekin,
  Osaka, Berlin, Warsaw, for instance; things terrible enough to hearten and
  steel the better elements in humanity for the achievement of that world peace
  towards which all these forces were urging it. Fortunately for mankind the
  two fundamental evils of traditionalism were just sufficient to neutralize
  each other during this long period of the incubation of the Modern State. The
  greed of the creditor balanced the greed of the armament dealer. As armaments
  grew more and more costly, the possible purchasers grew poorer and poorer. If
  Economy starved and hampered many good things in human life, it did at least
  finally take all vigour and confidence out of the development of the New
  Warfare. The Chemical Armament industry followed the other typical
  institutions of the old order into the general social liquidation which wound
  up the bankruptcy of Private Profit Capitalism.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap2_05"
     name="chap2_05">5. &mdash; THE FADING VISION OF A WORLD PAX:<br>
  JAPAN REVERTS TO WARFARE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">We have shown already how Parliamentary Democracy
  necessarily abolished real leaders in public affairs and substituted a
  strange type of pseudo-leader, men who were essentially RESULTANTS, who made
  nothing, created no forces, met no emergencies, but simply manoeuvred for
  position, prestige and the pettier rewards of power. They followed the
  collapse of the decaying order without an effort to arrest its decay. Why
  indeed should they have made an effort? They were representatives of the
  popular will, and if there was no popular will...</p>

  <p>We have already considered the behaviour of this amazingly ineffective
  collection of men in face of the financial dislocation that was choking the
  economic life of the race. It is doubtful if a single one of them ever gave a
  month's continuous study to the plain realities of that situation. And in the
  face of the accumulating stresses created by the maladjustments of
  Versailles, this galaxy of humbugs to whom democracy had entrusted the
  direction of human beings&mdash;humbugs unavoidably, for the system insisted
  upon it regardless of the best intentions&mdash;was equally enigmatical and
  impotent. Along the eastern frontiers of Italy and Germany the open sores
  festered. No one sought to heal them. In the Far East the conflict between
  Japan and China, failing a European protest, became frankly a formal war.
  Every world event cried louder than the last for collective action, and there
  was no collective action. The League of Nations appointed commissions of
  enquiry and produced often quite admirable analyses of hopeless
  situations.</p>

  <p>No one knew how to arrest the grim development of the situation. The chief
  of states repeated the traditional gestures, as though these were all that
  could be expected of them. But the patterns of history served them no more.
  They found themselves like men who attempt to gesticulate and find their
  limbs have changed to cloud and rock.</p>

  <p>Of all the "Powers" of that time the behaviour of Japan was the most
  decisive. In 1931 an internal revolution in that country had put political
  power into the hands of a patriotic military group, diplomatically
  unscrupulous and grossly sentimental according to the distinctive Japanese
  tradition, and this coterie set itself now with extraordinary energy and an
  equally extraordinary lack of authentic vision to caricature the aggressive
  imperialisms of the nineteenth-century Europeans. The mind of this ruling
  group was still intensely romantic, still obsessed by those ideas of national
  dominance and glory which had passed already so fatally over the intelligence
  of Christendom. Their military initiatives were quasi-Napoleonic, their
  diplomatic pretences and evasions modelled on the best European precedents.
  It was "Japan's turn" now.</p>

  <p>The investigation of just what these Japanese Imperialists imagined they
  were doing has greatly exercised our historical research department. But it
  is indeed only a special instance of the general riddle of what any "Power",
  regarded as a mentality in itself, imagined it was doing in that age. Only a
  century and a half has passed since those Japanese columns were marching into
  one Chinese town after another, and today our psychologists confess
  themselves baffled by an enterprise that was manifestly undertaken by men
  like ourselves and yet had already assumed a quality of absolute insanity.
  Why did these very intelligent people behave in that fashion?</p>

  <p>The clue lies in the extraordinary ease with which distasteful reality can
  be repressed by the human mind, and in the atmosphere of grotesque but
  flattering illusions in which these people were living. Just as in the West
  the bankers, economic experts, responsible statesmen would not realize the
  complete smash to which their fiscal and financial methods were plainly
  heading until the smash had actually come, so these Japanese militarists
  could not see the inevitable consequences of their continental adventures.
  They could not see behind them a miserable peasantry breeding itself down to
  the basest subsistence; a miserable urban proletariat deteriorating
  physically and morally; they could not estimate the mutterings of revolt in
  all their sweated and driven industrial centres; they could not understand
  the protests of their own fine and growing intelligentzia.</p>

  <p>Even the steady fall of the national credit abroad and the increasing
  economic stresses of the land aroused no misgivings of hallucination. Japan
  in her headlong pursuit of Western precedents was rapidly reproducing all the
  revolutionary conditions of the West. All that was lost upon her leaders. The
  one thing they could see clearly was that China was disorganized, that she
  was struggling with great difficulty to discover a new method of collective
  living to replace her ancient slack imperialism, and that by all the rules of
  the international game this was Japan's opportunity. They thought that, in
  very much the same way that the disorganization of the Empire of the Great
  Mogul had laid India bare to the piratical enterprise of the Europeans and
  permitted the establishment of the unstable aimless Indian Empire of the
  British, so now Fate had invited them to an equally glorious opportunity, to
  a parallel Japanese domination of the most or all of Asia. Who could tell
  where their imperial adventure would end&mdash;or whether it would have an
  end? The mirage of limitless power and glory opened out before them, as it
  has opened out to all empire builders since the world began.</p>

  <p>They were reckoning without the New Warfare, reckoning without modern
  industrialism, without the paradoxical self-destructiveness of Private
  Capitalist enterprise, without Russia, without America, without the superior
  mass, the traditional unity and mental obduracy of the Chinese population.
  They were thinking as a Pomeranian Junker or a British general from that
  "hot-bed of Imperialists", Ulster, might have thought before 1914. It was an
  archaic megalomania&mdash;that led to the killing of about three million
  combatants, an extreme social disintegration in China, and the final collapse
  of the Japanese monarchy.</p>

  <p>In the special histories of this struggle, the student who needs or
  desires the knowledge may find the detailed particulars of the Japanese
  aggressions from 1931 onward which grew at last into the formal invasion of
  China proper; the tentative of Shanghai, the invasion of Manchuria and the
  establishment of the puppet kingdom of Manchukuo (1932), the attack on
  Shanhaikwan which led to the penetration of the Great Wall, the invasion of
  China Proper from the north and the march on Pekin. The operations up to that
  point were largely on the pattern of the old warfare as it had been practised
  up to 1914. The Chinese were poorly equipped and had little modern material;
  the Japanese found it unnecessary to make any excessively expensive efforts
  to attain their objectives.</p>

  <p>All this earlier fighting went on to an accompaniment of protests from the
  quite powerless League of Nations at Geneva. A "Lytton Report" prepared by a
  commission of enquiry is to be found in the Historical Documents Series
  (2067111). But counterbalancing these remonstrances were the ambiguous
  utterances of the British Foreign Office, the support of the French armament
  industry and its Press, the overt support of a great group of American banks
  and their newspapers. In view of these divisions, the Japanese militarists
  had every reason to disregard Western criticism altogether.</p>

  <p>In 1935 the Japanese occupied Pekin and Tientsin. They set up a second
  puppet monarchy in Pekin. But they found very great difficulty in holding the
  country, particularly to the south and west of these centres. Manchuria,
  Inner Mongolia and Shansi remained seething with bandits and rebel bands, and
  the still unoccupied valley of the Yang-tsze-kiang remained fighting with an
  increasing unity under the leadership of the reorganized Kuomintang. In no
  part of China or Manchuria was it safe for a Japanese to go about alone, and
  a rigorous economic boycott, sustained by an omnipresent terrorism,
  continued. The Kuomintang was a directive association created by the great
  Chinese revolutionary Sun Yat Sen, and it had gone through various
  vicissitudes; it had a rough general resemblance to the Communist Party and
  the various European fascisms, and, like them, it sustained a core of
  conscious purpose throughout its community. It had no vital centre, no formal
  head; it was a thing of the mind, unquenchable by military operations. And
  under the stress of this resistance it had become violently patriotic and
  xenophobic.</p>

  <p>In 1936 Japan already had more than a million and a half men scattered
  between the Manchurian frontier and Canton, where a third landing had been
  made and still her hold upon China hardly extended beyond the range of her
  guns and the glitter of her bayonets. She had bombed Nankin twice on an
  extensive scale, Pekin before its surrender, and Wuchang and Hankow, with
  Yellow Cross bombs. Hundreds of thousands of people had been slaughtered, but
  the great invertebrate body of China seemed able to endure such losses with a
  stoicism impossible in a more highly organized state. In return the
  "Vindication of China" Society astonished the world by suddenly bombing and,
  through an error in the gas mixture, STERILIZING Osaka and Tokio.</p>

  <p>No one knew of these Chinese air forces until they appeared in action. The
  machines had come from Sweden by way of Russia. But nearly every Western
  country was supplying contraband of war to the Chinese. Unaccountable hostile
  aeroplanes with untraceable bombs appeared in the sky and came humming over
  the sea to Japan. Then in 1935 a Japanese transport blew up and sank in the
  Gulf of Pe-chih-li. In 1936, three Japanese liners were destroyed by mines of
  unknown origin within fifty miles of port. War supplies of all sorts got into
  China from Soviet Russia in the north and from the French and British
  possessions in the south, and the help and sympathy of America became more
  and more manifest as the vast imperial ambitions of the Japanese leaders
  became unmistakable. Western feeling had at first been acutely divided
  between distrust of Japan and the desire to see China restored to order on
  capitalist lines and saved from Communism. But with every Japanese advance
  European and American feeling veered back towards China. Australia and New
  Zealand appealed to the Washington Government for a joint guarantee to
  supplement the Imperial tie in 1937. They were advocating a mutual guarantee
  of all the Europeanized regions of the Pacific. For a time it seemed as
  though the Western world might be guided to a sort of unity by the flares of
  Japan. But the unforgettable humiliations inflicted upon Central Europe after
  the war still rankled sufficiently to prevent that.</p>

  <p>Even before the launching of the definitive conquest of China there had
  been considerable economic and social stress in Japan. The earlier successes,
  the easy capture of Pekin and the failure of an adequate Chinese army to
  materialize, had filled the island empire with patriotic enthusiasm and hope;
  the war was brought to a victorious conclusion three times, and each time it
  broke out again. No invader ever conquered Russia to the end, and no one ever
  completed the conquest of China. Always beyond the subjugated provinces
  appeared other provinces swarming with hostility. Szechwan and the south
  supplied inexhaustible support and supplies for the Kuomintang resistance. It
  seemed at last as though there could be no peace any more in China until the
  invaders fought their way through to Tibet.</p>

  <p>War weariness descended upon Nippon. The peasants saw their sons marching
  off, never to return, and shortages of ordinary commodities deepened to
  famine. There was already vigorous "Stop the War" agitation in Japan in 1935;
  there were continual strikes in Nagoya and hundreds of casualties, and
  afterwards there began a frantic dumping of accumulated goods abroad, to pay
  not merely for munitions but for such now vitally essential imports as
  Australian meat and Canadian and American corn. The war was starving the home
  fields of men and it was destroying the productivity of large areas of China.
  The social structure of Japan proved to be far too primitive to emulate the
  miracles of economy performed by the Germans during the World War. The
  confidence and credit of Japan sank steadily. Foreign loans became no longer
  possible even at such exorbitant rates as 14 or 15 per cent. And still there
  was no end in sight.</p>

  <p>The Japanese militarists had gone too far to recede. Behind them they had
  a suffering population that might rapidly become vindictive, and about the
  arena of the struggle watched Russia, America and Europe. According to the
  best traditions of their culture, these national leaders resolved on a
  supreme military effort, a march in overwhelming force into the central
  province of Hupeh. Colossal preparations were made, and every able-bodied
  Japanese who was not already enrolled was called up. This was to be "a blow
  at the heart".</p>

  <p>A convergent march from Nankin, Shantung and Canton was planned. This
  dispersal of the bases was justified by the necessity for living on the
  country as far as that remained possible. There were railways in existence
  from Canton and Shantung, but they were difficult to protect, and, apart from
  them, there was such an utter want of practicable roads that by the time the
  Japanese were in Hupeh a third of their forces were trailed out upon their
  lines of communication making roads, and the equipment of heavy guns and
  munitions they had been able to bring up was very little superior to that of
  the Chinese, who were still fighting with all the wealth of Szechwan at their
  backs and the almost overt sympathy of the West. The three great Japanese
  armies effected their junction in a loose ring round Wuchang&mdash;a ring
  that was for a time slowly drawn tighter and then ceased to contract. A
  deadlock ensued, a deadlock of mutual exhaustion. Neither up nor down the
  river was the closure of the ring complete. Throughout 1938, Japan waited for
  good news from the long crescents of trenches about Wuchang, and waited in
  vain. Pestilence broke out in July and defeated the utmost sanitary and
  medical efforts of the invaders. Then early in 1939 they began their retreat
  to Nankin, with transport disorganized, with mutiny growing, with all the
  country rising about them.</p>

  <p>The horrors of that retreat have never been fully told. The three Japanese
  armies at their maximum strength had numbered well over two million of men;
  but probably about a million or less remained fit enough for the retreat.
  Famine was far more deadly with them than the Chinese guerillas; the
  exhausted wretches fell out along the line of march and waited stoically for
  the end; few prisoners were taken; the Chinese had no food even if they had
  had mercy to give quarter, and the fallen were left to perish in their own
  time. The broken remnant that assembled at Nankin did not greatly exceed a
  hundred thousand, and still smaller bodies from the lines of communication
  fought their way homeward to the north and south. The rest of these two
  million lay in the vast cemeteries of Puki and Ki-chow, or they had been
  drowned in the floods, or their bodies were littered as they had dropped and
  crawled over the sad monotonous landscape of the Chinese hills. At Nankin the
  weary and dispirited survivors realized that Japan was now also at war with
  the United States and that Osaka and Nagoya were in the hands of Communist
  Committees.</p>

  <p>For some weeks the Japanese army sprawled inactive in its former
  cantonments to the west of Nankin. Then it revolted, shot many of its
  officers, declared for the social revolution and fraternized with the Chinese
  Red Army which had marched in under its nose from Hangchow and taken control
  of the city proper.</p>

  <p>The entry of the United States into the Eastern War, which did so much to
  complete the demoralization of militarist Japan, was the climax of a
  prolonged wrangle about the supply of mines and submarines to the Chinese,
  that became more and more acute after the sinking of a Japanese transport in
  the gulf of Pe-chih-li.</p>

  <p>It is only recently that the full history&mdash;which is also a very
  tedious and disputatious history&mdash;of the sea war against Japan has been
  worked out. Every contemporary record was falsified at the time; every event
  hidden completely or elaborately camouflaged. It is now fairly evident that
  not merely did private firms manufacture mines and build submarine
  mine-layers but that the various European navies under the plea of economy
  sold out a large proportion of quite modern and valid under-sea craft for
  "breaking up" to agents and dealers acting for South American intermediaries.
  The submarines, either intact or so "broken up" that they could easily be
  reconstructed, went to various Peruvian and Chilian ports and thence found
  their way across the Pacific to the Philippines. The Philippine Islands were
  quasi-independent, but the Manila declaration of President Roosevelt II in
  1937 had practically extended to them the protection of the Monroe Doctrine,
  and the Japanese had never had the surplus energy necessary to challenge this
  informal protectorate. Now these islands became the base for vexatious
  attacks upon their overseas trade and sea communications.</p>

  <p>The naval situation in the Pacific was a complicated one. To the east of
  the Philippines lie the Ladrones, a scattered group of volcanic islands, of
  which the largest, Guam, had been assigned to the United States of America by
  the Treaty of Versailles and was administered as a part of the American navy,
  while the rest were held by Japan under a mandate. (The Powers previously in
  possession had been first Spain and, after 1899, Germany.) The Japanese were
  bound by treaty not to fortify their holdings, but as the situation grew
  tense they seem to have ignored this restriction, at least to the extent of
  establishing submarine bases. Now that the situation was growing tenser the
  state of affairs above and under water between the Ladrones, the Philippines
  and the Asiatic mainland became darker and more dangerous. There was a
  threatening concentration of the American Fleet between Guam and the
  Philippines to ensure the neutrality of the latter, a patrolling
  concentration of the Japanese along the Chinese coast, and an obscure
  activity of privateering submarines and ambiguous shipping, which smuggled
  munitions and supplies and raided weak points of the Japanese
  communications.</p>

  <p>Above water a submarine, like any other ship, can fly a flag and claim the
  respect due to its nationality, but mines fly no flags, and under water a
  submarine may be able to recognize the coded signals of a co-national but has
  no means at all of distinguishing a neutral from an enemy. Mistakes and
  pseudo-mistakes were inevitable. Two American submarines disappeared in 1936.
  Then several Japanese submarines vanished from the Ladrone archipelago.
  Disputes that broke out in neutral cafés came to a murderous end in the
  depths. The American navy took matters into its own hands. By 1937 an
  informal naval war had developed in the Western Pacific.</p>

  <p>Neither Power hurried on to an actual declaration of war. America, in
  spite of, or perhaps because of, the bold experimenting of Roosevelt II, was
  in a state of deepening economic and political disorder, and Japan was
  putting forth her utmost strength for that disastrous "blow at the heart" in
  China. But many of the more conservative influences in the United States saw
  in a Pacific war a saving distraction of public attention and public energy.
  There was an agitation to re-annex the Philippines, and after the Japanese
  failure to hold Wuchang the drive towards open war became uncontrollable.</p>

  <p>The particulars of the brief, destructive and indecisive naval war that
  followed need not occupy us here. The battle fleets met in the Western
  Pacific and separated after two days of gunfire and heavy losses. Ammunition
  gave out, it seems, on the Japanese side. At any rate they drew off in the
  twilight under a smokescreen. The Americans claimed the victory because they
  were able to go on to Manila, while the Japanese withdrew to the protection
  of their minefields and submarines and were never able to emerge again for
  lack of material. Both Powers were now in a state of deepening domestic
  stress, and their war, in a technical sense, never ended. That is to say,
  there was no final treaty as between two Powers, because both had in effect
  collapsed. They fell apart. Social revolution swept the conflict off the
  stage.</p>

  <p>[The student will be reminded, by this inconclusive termination, of the
  almost incessant, dreary and futile wars of Byzantine and Sassanid, that
  devastated Asia Minor for three centuries and did not so much come to an end
  as suffer effacement from history by the sponge of Islam.]</p>

  <p>The social disintegration of Japan, once it had begun, was very rapid. The
  great mass of the population, the peasants, had been scarcely affected by the
  process of Westernization, and they lapsed very readily into the same
  unprogressive variant of Communism as their equivalents in Kwantung, Chekiang
  and Fukien had adopted. A small Westernized intelligentzia with many internal
  feuds and doctrinal disputes struggled, not very effectively, in the larger
  towns to turn this merely insurgent Communism into modern and constructive
  paths after the Moscow pattern. Fragmentation when it came was swift and
  thorough. Militarism degenerated into brigandage and local feudalism. Here
  and there some scion of the old nobility reappeared with his attendant
  Samurai as a gangster boss.</p>

  <p>In the space of a few years all Asia from the Pacific to Persia seemed to
  be sliding back to political and social chaos, to hand-to-mouth cultivation,
  destitution and endemic pestilence. For the greater part of India and most of
  Further India were also now drifting back to barbarism. There also the
  phrases and the insubordination, if not the spirit and methods, of Communism
  had captured vast multitudes who had remained completely unaffected by other
  European ideas. It was Communism without any Five Year Plan or indeed any
  conception of a plan. It was the class-war in its ultimate crudity. It killed
  money-lenders and tax-collectors with gusto and elaboration. It evolved
  strange religious fanaticisms, and it abandoned sanitation as "boujawai", the
  accursed thing. The imperial power in India was not overthrown; rather it was
  stripped of effective prestige and receded to an immense distance. The
  princes remained formally "loyal", though in some cases they tacitly annexed
  "disturbed districts" adjacent to their proper dominions. Localities and
  local adventurers improvised a sort of social order at a low level and with a
  continually completer disregard of any central authority.</p>

  <p class="first">The recession of the directive influence of the half
  modernized European imperialisms in Asia went on steadily. Even as early as
  1929 the spread of a peasant communism similar to that which had obtained so
  strong a hold upon the popular imagination in China was causing grave alarm
  to the Indian Government. The seizure and trial of a group of British and
  Indian agitators at Meerut, and the extravagantly heavy sentences passed upon
  them in 1933, showed both the gravity of these fears and the unintelligent
  clumsiness with which the situation was being met.</p>

  <p>For the British Empire there was to be no such decline and fall as
  happened to Rome. Instead it relaxed, as we shall now describe, to
  nothing.</p>

  <p>Unhappily, before it relaxed in India it had, as in Ireland, a brief
  convulsive phase of "firmness"....</p>

  <h2><a id="chap2_07"
     name="chap2_07">7. &mdash; THE MODERN STATE AND GERMANY</a></h2>

  <p class="first">A question of primary importance in human history is this:
  Why were the lessons of the Great War, and the subsequent economic and social
  disorders, lessons which seem to us to-day to be as starkly plain as lessons
  could be&mdash; why were these lessons lost upon every one of the great
  communities of thought into which the world was divided? British thought,
  French thought, American thought, German, Russian, Italian thought, seem in
  our retrospect to ring the changes upon every conceivable sequence of
  prejudice and stupidity. Why was Wilson's start towards world unification not
  followed up? Why after 1932 was there no vigour to reconstruct the League of
  Nations, when all the world was crying for some central authority to unify
  money and economic life? Why did the Age of Frustration last so long? We have
  already noted some of the controlling causes, the mercenary Press, the vast
  anti-social private interests, the heavy weight of tradition, the reactionary
  quality of schoolmasters, the social disintegration due to economic
  demoralization. But even these malignant influences, taken all together, do
  not seem sufficient for this blindness in the general intelligence of our
  race towards the obvious elements of its situation.</p>

  <p>Behind all these conditions making for failure there was something else:
  there was an intrinsic weakness in the forces of reconstruction, there was a
  fundamental lack. It was impossible for the world to get out of its
  difficulties because it had no definite complete idea of what it wanted to
  get out to. It had ideas, yes, more than enough, but they were confused and
  often mutually contradictory ideas. A drowning man cannot save himself by
  swimming unless he has something solid to which he can swim. The deficiency
  was not moral nor material, it was intellectual. There was the will for
  salvation and the material for salvation, but there was no plan of salvation.
  The world has no definition of an objective. That had still to be made plain
  to it.</p>

  <p>It will make this matter clearer if we consider the mental and emotional
  phases of one typical culture community of central importance at that time,
  the German. Stories similar in essence, if widely different in detail, could
  be given of the French, Anglo-Saxon, Russian and Spanish-speaking
  communities. The feature they had in common was this, a failure to realize
  that there could be no salvation now unless it was a comprehensive salvation.
  They were attempting to do severally and with a jostling competitiveness what
  could only be done with the utmost difficulty in unison. That meant for every
  one of them the paralysing influence of a war threat, extreme economic
  instability, incapacity for dealing with morbid financial conditions, and a
  consequent state of mental "worry" that made every move inaccurate and
  untimely.</p>

  <p>It is only when we realize the sapping of that aggressive energy that had
  well-nigh Europeanized the whole world before the World War that we can
  understand the length of the Age of Frustration. Certain facts of fundamental
  importance to the continued health of our world community have to be
  stressed. Europe could not lead the world to unity when the world seemed
  dying to be led to unity, because Europe itself was profoundly disunited. The
  World War was merely the explosion of tensions that had been straining below
  the surface throughout the whole First Period of World Prosperity. Before the
  European peoples, who by 1920 amounted to a quarter of the whole human race,
  could resume the exploring, experimenting and civilizing rôle they had played
  for two centuries, it was necessary that they should be purged of a chronic
  mental disease&mdash;a disease which had, it seemed, to rise to an acute
  phase and run its enfeebling and devastating course before it could be
  treated: the disease of hate.</p>

  <p>Although each year in the Thirties saw the international tension in Europe
  increasing, it was only in 1940 that actual warfare broke out. All Europe was
  "mined" for ten years before that time, but the very consciousness of that
  fact, if it did not hold back the drift towards war, increased the gravity of
  its onset. That ingenious contrivance of President Wilson's, the Polish
  Corridor, Poland's "access to the sea", was the particular mine that exploded
  first. But it was only one of a series of accumulating detonations which were
  destined to blow the still creaking ineffective League of Nations, and indeed
  nearly every vestige of the unfortunate Treaty of Versailles and its
  subordinate "settlements", out of the way of human readjustment.</p>

  <p>The mental phases of that great body of Europeans who used the German
  language summarize the world situation. The history of Europe from 1900 to
  1950 could be told in a study of the German brain alone, its torment and the
  reactions it evoked in the peoples about it. It was a brain of outstanding
  vigour and crudity. It aroused admiration, envy and fear. Its achievements in
  material science were magnificent; its energy of industrial organization was
  unparalleled. Its mathematical and psychological ineptitudes were redeemed by
  the Jewish intelligences entangled in its meshes. Compared with the
  Anglo-Saxon brain its political thought was unsupple, and it had neither the
  extreme lucidity of the French intelligence, the boldness of the Italian, nor
  the poetic power of Spain and Russia. It had these conspicuous limitations.
  Its obstinate association with a stupidly arrogant monarchism and a woolly
  tangle of preposterous racial pretensions stood in the way of sympathetic
  cooperation with any other cultural system. It had failed conspicuously to
  assimilate the non-German subject populations involved in its political web.
  It had intensified the defensive nationalism of the French; its tactless
  challenge upon the sea had terrified and exasperated the British; it had
  roused even America to a wary disapproval and a final hostility. Russia it
  had never won, but then in the huge carcass of pre-revolutionary Russia there
  was very little to be won anyhow. (There was indeed no real national
  self-consciousness in Russia before the Soviet régime; there was only
  Dostoievsky and the Tzar.) Assertive ungraciousness had been the chief factor
  in Germany's isolation and the cause of its defeat in the World War.</p>

  <p>Yet after defeat this afflicted German mentality, if only on account of a
  certain toughness and vigour it possessed, remained still the central reality
  and the central perplexity of the European system. War and disaster could not
  alter the fact that the backbone of Europe, the most skilled, industrious,
  teachable and intelligent block of its population, spoke and thought German.
  What might happen to it, what would happen to it, should have been the
  primary preoccupation of every intelligent statesman. For if Germany had gone
  right everything would have gone right. But there were no statesmen
  sufficiently intelligent to consider anything of the sort. Germany had had a
  phase of pride and megalomania. It had been immensely disillusioned, it had
  thrown off its glittering imperialist headship, it had accepted military
  defeat. It had even passed through a phase of humility. At first it did not
  hate conspicuously. Amidst great difficulties the new republic displayed
  creative courage, moderation, a dawning sense of the significance of world
  politics.</p>

  <p>Creative, forward-looking minds turned to Germany with an entirely
  pathetic hopefulness. "Now we shall see what Germany can do," they said. "Be
  patient with Germany." All the world scolded France for her inveterate
  distrust. Given courage and generosity abroad and leadership at home this
  great mass of Teutonic brains might have taken up the task of the Modern
  State then, and fallen into cooperation with the rest of a disillusioned but
  renascent world. It might even have led in the work of reconstruction, and
  1918 might have been the opening year of a phase of world renewal.</p>

  <p>But that was not to be. The world had still to reap a harvest of disunion
  through sixty tragic years. At home leadership came to Germany too late.
  Stresemann mastered his lesson too slowly and died too soon. Brüning was
  betrayed by Hindenburg's mental decay. And abroad it seemed to the Germans
  that there was nothing but war-strained and vindictive enemies. They looked
  for friends and saw only Foreign Offices. We have told already how the rôle
  of only sinner in a world of outraged saints was thrust upon Germany by the
  Conference of Versailles. She was to be permanently enfeebled, restrained and
  humiliated. German babies yet unborn were expected to be born penitent about
  the war. They were to gasp for their first breath under the smacks of an
  unforgiving world.</p>

  <p>How all the good effort in Germany was thwarted, how the nets of suspicion
  held her down, would make a long and intricate story. At last these losers of
  the World War became as violent and frantic as stifled creatures fighting for
  air. Only by a feat of imagination can we now put ourselves in their places.
  Everything seemed to be making for the strangulation of Central Europe. The
  young energetic men in the defeated countries were to be given no share in
  the rebuilding of their shattered world. That was to be reserved for the new
  generation of the conquerors. They were to live in an atmosphere of
  punishment, toiling, heavily taxed, and outlawed from the advancement of
  civilization to the very end of their days. That they should recover
  prosperity or achieve great things would be an offence.</p>

  <p>Naturally life so circumscribed was bitter and lapsed very easily towards
  vice, apathy or blind revolt. There is a remarkable novel in the Historical
  Documents Series (Fabian, by Erich Kastner, 1932) which renders the
  individual aspect of this phase of German life very vividly. Another novel
  almost equally vivid and illuminating is Kleiner Mann, was nun? by Hans
  Fallada, 1932.</p>

  <p>These conditions of mind, this tied and stifled outlook upon life, were,
  it must be admitted, by no means confined to the German-speaking peoples. The
  intelligent and ambitious young Indian or Egyptian or negro, the intelligent
  young man of any subordinated, handicapped and restrained people or
  class&mdash;and this covered perhaps two-thirds of the youth of our race in
  these days&mdash; participated in the same distress of a foreordained
  inferiority and futility. But the young German had recent memories of hope
  and pride and a greater fund of resentment and aggressive energy. He had no
  tradition of inferiority and subservient adjustment.</p>

  <p>Unhappily no teachers or leaders arose to point him on to his legitimate
  rôle in the replacement of the current disorder by the Modern World State.
  The Hohenzollern régime and the stresses of the war had stood in the way of
  his attaining anything like the cosmopolitanism of, say, the English and
  Americans. His new republicanism was superficial and half-hearted, and in the
  schools and universities the teachers and leaders of the old militarist
  régime were still living, active and malignant. The Press and all the
  organizations of instruction and suggestion stood out of the revolution and
  showed themselves only too eager and skilful in restoring a pre-war
  fierceness. The futility of the new Germany was their text. "This is not
  German" they insisted. "Go back to the old Imperialism," they said, "and try
  again." The spirit of the women about the new generation, mothers and
  sweethearts alike, was for the most part one of passionate indignation.</p>

  <p>An acute contemporary observer, L. B. Namier, pointed out that it was
  almost a law in history that war-strained and defeated countries should
  relapse towards violent patriotism between twelve and fifteen years after the
  war in which they suffered concluded. He suggested that this was precisely
  the time when the children who, without any participation in the realities of
  warfare, had felt all the strain and bitterness of defeat and all the hatred
  of the enemy would have grown up to manhood. These children became the
  energetic stratum in the population by 1933.</p>

  <p>It was at this phase in European history that the rise of Hitlerism
  occurred. Adolf Hitler, as the decisive product of Germany in labour, is one
  of the most incredible figures in the whole of history. He must have
  astonished even the teachers and writers who had evoked him. We can study his
  personal presence from a hundred different angles in Vol. 30112 of the
  Historical Portrait Gallery, and it is that of an entirely commonplace man,
  void of dignity, void of fine quality. We can hear his voice, we can hear him
  persuading, exhorting and attempting to reason from the numerous steel-tape
  records that were made of his speeches. It is a raucous, strained voice,
  talking violently but incoherently. It is the voice of a vulgar, limited,
  illiterate man, lashing himself to fierceness, shouting, threatening, beating
  his fists at the window, smashing the furniture about him, to escape from
  perplexity and despair. He was perfectly simple and honest in his quality.
  And that was perhaps the secret of his career. He gave vent to the German
  overstrain. He is the voice of Germany losing control.</p>

  <p>He denounced foreigners, Jews, Cosmopolitans, Communists, Republicans,
  owners of property and leaders in finance with raucous impartiality, and
  nothing is so pleasing to perplexed unhappy people as the denunciation of
  others. Not their fault, their troubles. They have been betrayed. To
  Fallada's question, "Little Man, what now?" his answer was, "Massacre Jews,
  expel foreigners, arm and get more arms, be German, utterly German, and
  increase and multiply."</p>

  <p>One has to remember that he never carried with him even an absolute voting
  majority of the German public. But the people permitted him to seize power
  and shatter their republic, stifle public discussion and destroy their
  liberties. They had no energy to resist him. They had no conception left in
  their fagged and hope-starved brains of any finer rôle than that which his
  bawling nationalism, his violent campaign against Communists and imaginary
  Communistic plots, against Jews, speculators and Liberals, presented to them.
  The treason of the senile Hindenburg to the Republic that had trusted him,
  conduced inestimably to the adventurer's success.</p>

  <p>Hitler's exploit in seizing Germany and turning it back towards reaction
  was modelled on Mussolini's precedent. But intellectually he was far inferior
  to that strange figure. He took all that was worst in the Fascist régime and
  never rose to the real constructive effort or the competent industry of his
  prototype. One little point that illustrates his general ignorance and
  essential feeble-mindedness was the adoption of the Swastika, the running
  cross, as the emblem of his Nazis. This brisk, silly little sign is of very
  old origin, and, as we have noted in the earlier stages of this summary of
  history, its ornamental use was one of the associated characteristics of that
  type of Neolithic culture, that culture of brownish and dark-white warm-water
  peoples, from which the early civilizations sprang. It is hardly known in
  connexion with the so-called "Nordics" or with the negro peoples, and it is
  in no way expressive of an "Aryan" culture. Old writers used to declare it
  was the "symbol" of the sun, but it seems to have signified little beyond a
  certain cheerfulness. It took the place of an idea in the muddled heads of
  the Nazis and they treated it with immense solemnity and wore it on their
  banners, clothes, proclamations and wherever else they could. Arden Essenden,
  when it was revived in Europe during the struggle for the air control, called
  it the "idiot's own trade mark", and it has certainly had a fatal attraction
  for many second-rate imaginative types.</p>

  <p>So for a time, under a hubbub of young blackguards in brown shirts and
  Swastika badges, Germany, just when her rather heavy but persistent and
  faithful mind would have been of primary value in mankind's struggle with the
  world problem, passed out of the intellectual commonweal of mankind. Her real
  mind went into exile, in America, in England, in Switzerland, in irony or in
  hiding. She missed her proper share in the unification of mankind in the
  twentieth century, just as she missed her share in the Europeanization of the
  world in the eighteenth and nineteenth. At home this National Socialism
  sought destructively to construct, sought to restore her former scientific
  prestige and industrial efficiency by boasting, exhortation, intolerance,
  outrage and compulsion. It was a pitiful and tragic phase, the dementia of a
  great nation. The story of German life during this interval is a rowdy and
  unhappy story&mdash;a story of faction fights and street encounters,
  demonstrations and counter-demonstrations, of a complicating tyranny of
  blackmailing officials, and at last of an ill managed and unsuccessful war,
  that belied the innate orderliness of the Teutonic peoples. There was a
  progressive increase of secret vice and furtive dishonesty, the outcome of
  hopelessness. The number of people killed or seriously injured in riots and
  civil conflicts in Germany, or murdered for political reasons, between 1932
  and 1936 amounted to something over rather than under thirty thousand.</p>

  <p class="first">[This section was in a detached fascicle, but its place
  seems to be here.&mdash;ED.]</p>

  <p>The student of history will find it almost impossible to understand the
  peculiar difficulties of political life as it was lived until about a hundred
  years ago, nor will he grasp the essential differences between what was
  called education in those days and the educational processes we are still
  developing to-day, unless he masters the broad facts about these systems of
  hatred that dominated the group relationships of mankind right up to the
  assertion of the Modern State. We have given the main particulars of the
  issue between the Germans and the Poles, but that is only one striking and
  historically important instance of a general condition. We could give fifty
  such chapters. Nearly everywhere populations were to be found steeped in and
  moved by mass hatreds of a volume and obduracy outside any contemporary human
  experience.</p>

  <p>All these hatreds arose out of the same essential causes. Two or more
  population groups, each with its own special narrow and inadaptable culture
  and usually with a distinctive language or dialect, had been by the change of
  scale in human affairs jammed together or imposed one upon another. A sort of
  social dementia ensued. In the absence of a common idea of community,
  civilized motives gave place to instinctive hostilities and spasmodic
  impulses.</p>

  <p>Wherever there were mingled populations these hates were found and, except
  in the Basque country, Wales and Lapland, they were intense enough to be of
  primary political importance. South and east of Bohemia there seemed no
  boundary to the realms of hate. The Magyar hated the Slav, the Slav the
  Italian, the Roumanian the Russian. Religious differences, the mischief of
  priests, cut up even racial solidarities; the Catholic Slav hated the
  Orthodox Slav and the Orthodox Greeks in Macedonia were hopelessly divided
  among themselves. Over all the ancient domain of the Sultan, through Persia,
  through India, hates extended. Islam was rent by two ancient hate systems.
  These mass hatreds were accepted in a kind of despair by even the wisest.
  They defied the policies of statesmen absolutely. They were supposed to be
  beyond human control.</p>

  <p>It is extraordinary how recent is the intelligent mitigation and
  suppression of hatred. Our ancestors did not envisage this as a controllable
  mental disease. They did not know that it was possible to get through life
  without hatred, just as they did not know that the coughs and colds that
  afflicted them and most of the phenomena of senility were avoidable.</p>

  <p>But it is amazing to think how submissively human beings allowed their
  lives to be spoilt by controllable things&mdash;until almost within living
  memory. It was not only against hate and envy that they made no effort. They
  left their poor nerves bare and unprotected from an endless persecution by
  man-made afflictions. Up to 2010 they lived in towns that were crazy with
  noise; there was practically no control of offensive sounds, and the visual
  clamour of advertisements died out only in the needy decades that preceded
  the Air Dictatorship. But then it was still hardly more than a century that
  there had been sufficient light upon the towns and highways to drive away the
  blackness of night and overcast weather. In northern climates in the winter
  before the twentieth century people lived between the nocturnal dark and a
  dismal grey half-light which they called daylight, not seeing the sun often
  for weeks together.</p>

  <p>And before the nineteenth century it is clear to anyone who can read
  between the lines that mankind STANK. One has only to study the layout and
  drainage of their houses and towns, their accommodation for washing, their
  exiguous wardrobes, the absence of proper laundry organization and of
  destructors for outworn objects, to realize that only usage saved them from a
  perpetual disgust and nausea. No wonder that, quite apart from their bad food
  and loathsome cooking, they coughed, spat, ached, went deaf and blind and
  feeble, in a continual alternation of lassitude and mutual irritation.</p>

  <p>These conditions of life have gone one after another and almost
  imperceptibly. Few of us realize how different it was to be a human being
  only a few hundred years ago. It is only when we take our imaginations with
  us back into the past that we realize how evil to nose, eye, ear and soul the
  congregation of human beings could be. And necessarily, inevitably, because
  of the ill-interpreted protests of body and mind against this mode of
  existence, they hated&mdash;almost at haphazard. We have in Swift's
  Gulliver's Travels (1726) the cry of one man of exceptional intelligence and
  sensibility who discovered himself imprisoned as it were in the life of the
  eighteenth century and could find neither outlet nor opiate. The reek of the
  kennels of a medieval town was nothing to the stench of hatred in the popular
  Press of the twentieth century. The ordinary newspaper of that time was not
  so much a news sheet as a poison rag. Every morning the common man took in
  fresh suggestions of suspicion and resentment and gratified his spite with
  bad news and malicious gossip.</p>

  <p>Hatred, we know, is a morbid, infectious and preventable relapse to which
  the mammalian cerebrum, and particularly the cerebrum of the social types, is
  prone. It is a loss of rational control. It is caused normally by small
  repeated irritations of the cerebral cortex. The contagion may occur at any
  phase before or after maturity, and acute attacks predispose the brain for
  recurrence and may run together at last into a chronic condition of
  vindictive disapproval.</p>

  <p>Once hatred has established itself to that extent it seems to be
  ineradicable. The patient seeks, often with the greatest ingenuity, occasion
  for offence, and finds a profound satisfaction in the nursing of resentment
  and the search for reprisals and revenges. He has what he calls his "proper
  pride". He disapproves of his fellow creatures and grudges them happiness.
  Our current education is framed very largely to avert and anticipate this
  facile contagion, but the Press of that time subsisted by its dissemination,
  in the interests of reactionary forces. We are as sedulous now for
  cleanliness and ventilation in our mental as in our physical atmosphere. The
  contrast between a contemporary crowd and the crowds depicted by Hogarth or
  Raphael is not simply in the well-clad, well-grown, well-nourished and
  well-exercised bodies, the absence of rags and cripples, but in the candid
  interested faces that replace the introverted, suspicious and guarded
  expressions of those unhappy times. It is only in the light of this universal
  malaria that human history can be made comprehensible.</p>

  <p>And now this great German mind stretching across the centre of Europe in
  seventy million brains was incapable of autotherapy, and let its sickness
  have its way with it. It would not recognize that it suffered from anything
  but a noble resentment. Least of all peoples was it able to entertain those
  ideas of a world-wide cooperation of the World-State, which were still
  seeking their proper form and instrument. It was a deeper hate altogether
  than the fear-begotten hate of the French. In both these antagonized
  countries cosmopolitan sanity went begging, but most so in Germany.</p>

  <p>The fluctuations in German hatred during the Thirties were curiously
  affected by subconscious currents of discretion. Though Germany was fiercely
  belligerent in spirit, her armament still lagged behind that of her
  neighbours; her Hitlerites snarled and threatened, but rather against Poland
  than France, and when the tension became too great it found relief by
  outrages upon Communists, Pacificists and intellectuals and by an exacerbated
  persecution of those whipping-boys of the Western civilization, the Jews.
  From the accession of Hitler to the chancellorship of the Reich in 1933
  onward, not only looting and massacre, but legalized outrage, became an ever
  present menace in the life of the German Jew.</p>

  <p>Faber speaks in his studies of political psychology of the "hate map" of
  the world. The intensity of the colouring of such a map would vary widely.
  The English-speaking states (except for Ireland, that erstwhile "island of
  evergreen malice", which is now the most delightful and welcoming of summer
  resorts) and the Spanish-speaking communities felt hate far less intensely
  than the peoples of the continental European patchwork. They were less
  congested, they were free from acute alien interference, they had more space
  to move about in, and the infection was not so virulent. For two decades
  Spain and Spanish South America (after the Peruvian Settlement) sustained
  indeed a more liberal and creative mentality than any other region of the
  world. The Spanish contribution, beginning with Unamuno and Ortega y Gasset
  and going onward through a long list of great names, was of increasing
  importance in the building up of the Modern World-State.</p>

  <p>Russia, we may note, was never so constructive mentally as Spain. She had
  not now the same wealth of freely thinking and writing men. She had no
  surplus of mental energy to philosophize. She ecstasized, prophesied or
  dogmatized. Such brain discipline as she had was used up in her sprawling
  technical efforts. But she again was not a malignant country. Young Russia
  was taught to hate indeed, but to hate a dissolving enemy, the Wicked
  Imperialist. Even in that hate there was an element of humorous caricature.
  When in due course the Wicked Imperialist faded away to the quality of a
  nursery Ogre, he took with him most of the hatred out of Russia. Hate, except
  in brief vivid spurts, does not seem congenial to the Russian
  temperament.</p>

  <p>Few people in 1940 realized that the essential political trouble in the
  world, as distinguished from its monetary malaise, was this endemic disease,
  and still fewer had the boldness of mind even to think of the drastic
  cleansing and destruction of infected social institutions and economic
  interests and accumulations that was needed if the disease was ever to be
  stamped out. Meanwhile along the tangled frontiers of Central and Eastern
  Europe the sores festered and the inflammation increased.</p>

  <p>Among the more frequent methods of releasing hatred in the more troubled
  communities were aggressive demonstrations inviting or involving violence,
  attacks on representative buildings, such as embassies and consulates, the
  defilement of flags, statues and other symbols (in India the slaughter of
  sacred or forbidden animals such as cows or pigs in holy places), quarrels
  picked in cafés and restaurants, beatings-up, assassinations, the throwing of
  bombs and crackers into parties and gatherings of the objectionable
  nationality, or into law courts, religious buildings and other unsuitable
  places for an explosion, firing at sentinels and across boundaries. Along the
  Adriatic coast it would appear there was an exceptionally strong disposition
  to insult the characteristic Italian respect for statues and pictures.</p>

  <p>This was of recent origin. At the Congress of Versailles Italy had been
  bilked by her French and British Allies of a considerable amount of the
  Dalmatian coast-line&mdash;to which indeed neither she nor they had any
  right, but which nevertheless had been promised to her in the secret
  engagements that had brought her into the World War. Her patriots had never
  ceased to resent this broken promise, nor the Jugo-Slav peoples, who held the
  coveted districts, to fear a forcible annexation. There had been much
  propaganda about the dispute. One prominent argument on the Italian side was
  that the Republic of Venice (of which Rome was the natural heir) had formerly
  dominated this coast, and, in proof of this, appeal was made to the public
  buildings in the towns of the disputed regions, which everywhere bore the
  insignia of their Italian founders and particularly the distinctive lion of
  Venice. For that was the Fascist fantasy: wherever the Venetian lion had made
  its lair or the Roman eagles cast their shadows, from Hadrian's Wall in
  England to Mesopotamia, the Fascisti claimed to rule.</p>

  <p>This contention, though taken calmly enough by the English, French,
  Spanish, Turks and other emancipated peoples, was bitterly resented by the
  populations more immediately threatened, and particularly did it arouse
  resentment and hatred along the Dalmatian coast. For the young and excitable
  Slav, those sculptured lions and archaic eagles, those antique vestiges, were
  robbed of their artistic and historical charm; they took on an arrogant
  contemporary quality and seemed to demand an answer to their challenge. His
  response was to deface or mutilate them.</p>

  <p>Already in 1932 there were bitter recriminations between Rome and Belgrade
  on this score, and in 1935 and again in 1937 fresh trouble arose. The later
  occasions were not simply matters of chipping and breaking. These heraldic
  and highly symbolic animals were now painted, and painted in such a manner as
  to bring them into grave contempt. And the outrages were not confined to
  heraldic animals. Portraits and images of Mussolini were also adorned all too
  often with pencilled moustaches, formidable whiskers, a red nose and other
  perversions of his vigorous personality.</p>

  <p>Such vexatious modes of expression were in constant evidence in all the
  inflamed areas. To us they seem trivial, imbecile, preposterous, but then
  they were steeped in tragic possibility.</p>

  <p>The reader must picture for himself, if he can, how things went in the
  brain of some youngster growing to manhood in one of these hate regions, the
  constant irritation of restrictions, the constant urge to do some vivid
  expressive thing, the bitter, unconsoling mockery against the oppressor, and
  at last the pitiful conspiracy, the still more pitiful insult. He must think
  of the poor excitement of getting the paint-pot and the ladder, of watching
  the receding police patrol, the tremulous triumph of smearing the hated
  object. That perhaps was the poor crown of life for that particular brain.
  Then the alarm, the conflict, the flight, a shot, a wound, straw and filth in
  a prison cell, the beatings and the formal punishment, the intensified
  resolve to carry on the resistance. There was nothing to think of then but
  the next outrage, the next riot. So very often the story went on to wounds
  and death, the body crumpled up on a street pavement and trampled under foot
  or put against a wall to be shot, and then the rotting away and dispersal of
  that particular human brain with all the gifts and powers it possessed. That
  was all that life could be for hundreds of thousands of those hate-drenched
  brains. For that they came into being, like flowers that open in a rain of
  filth.</p>

  <p>A Natural History of Cruelty has recently been published by Otto Jaspers
  (2085 &mdash;), a lineal descendant of that Professor Jaspers of Heidelberg
  University under whom De Windt studied and to whose Die geistiger Situation
  der Gegenwart De Windt was greatly indebted. Cruelty in the Twentieth Century
  is treated in considerable detail, and it makes very terrible reading indeed.
  Happily it is not considered a necessary part of a general education to probe
  under those dark processes of the human mind which make the infliction of
  horrible pain and injuries a relief to otherwise intolerable mental
  distresses. The psychologist, however, must acquaint himself with all those
  facts; he cannot fully understand our intricate minds without them, and the
  practical disappearance of deliberate cruelty from our world to-day makes the
  horror literature of the World War and World Slump periods a mine of
  essential material for his investigations. One or two glimpses we have given
  the student. If he has any imagination he will be able to expand those hints
  for himself into an infinitude of mutilations, tortures and wanton
  violence.</p>

  <p>The older psychologists were disposed to classify cruelty as a form of
  sexual aberration&mdash;in ordinary speech we still use their old word
  Sadistic&mdash;but this attribution is no longer respected by contemporary
  authorities. Cruelty goes far beyond the sexual field. Just as hate is now
  understood to be a combative fear compound, the stiffening up of a faltering
  challenge, which may become infectious, so cruelty is regarded as a natural
  development of effort against resistance, so soon as the apprehension of
  frustration exceeds a certain limit. It is a transformation of our attempt to
  subdue something, usually a living thing, to our will, under the exasperation
  of actual or anticipated obduracy.</p>

  <p>This interpretation makes it plain why the breakdown of the private
  capital economic and political system and the world-wide uncertainty, dismay
  and want which ensued was followed by wave after wave of unprecedented
  cruelty. In 1900, a visitor from another sphere might reasonably have decided
  that man, as one met him in Europe or America, was a kindly, merciful and
  generous creature. In 1940 he might have decided, with an equal show of
  justice, that this creature was diabolically malignant. And yet it was the
  same creature, under different conditions of stress.</p>

  <p>There were many thousands of suicides between 1930 and 1940&mdash;suicides
  of sensitive men and women, who could endure the dreadful baseness and
  cruelty of life no longer. Yet in the records of the reviving world of 1980
  there is scarcely a mention of atrocious conduct towards human beings or
  animals. It was not a change of nature; it was a change of phase. Millions of
  people who had actually killed, massacred, tortured, were still
  alive&mdash;and they were behaving now quite reasonably and well. Most of
  them had forgotten their own deeds more or less completely. Hope had returned
  to human life. The frantic years were past.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap2_09"
     name="chap2_09">9. &mdash; THE LAST WAR CYCLONE, 1940-50</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The drift to war in Europe became more powerful with the
  elimination of Japan and the United States from the possibility of
  intervention, and with the deepening preoccupation of Britain with Indian
  disorder and with the Black Revolt in South Africa. The last restraints upon
  continental hatreds had gone. The issues simplified.</p>

  <p>War came at last in 1940. The particular incident that led to actual
  warfare in Europe was due to a Polish commercial traveller, a Pole of Jewish
  origin, who was so ill advised as to have trouble with an ill-fitting dental
  plate during the halt of his train in Danzig. He seems to have got this plate
  jammed in such a fashion that he had to open his mouth wide and use both
  hands to struggle with it, and out of deference to his fellow passengers he
  turned his face to the window during these efforts at readjustment. He was a
  black-bearded man with a long and prominent nose, and no doubt the effect of
  his contortions was unpleasing. Little did he realize that his clumsy hands
  were to release the dogs of war from the Pyrenees to Siberia.</p>

  <p>The primary irritant seems to have been either an orange-pip or a small
  fragment of walnut.</p>

  <p>Unhappily, a young Nazi was standing on the platform outside and construed
  the unfortunate man's facial disarrangement into a hostile comment upon his
  uniform. For many of these youths were of an extreme innate sensibility. The
  flames of patriotic indignation shot up in his heart. He called up three
  fellow guards and two policemen&mdash;for like the Italian Fascisti these
  young heroes rarely acted alone&mdash;and boarded the train in a swift and
  exemplary mood. There was a furious altercation, rendered more difficult by
  the facts that the offending Pole knew little or no German and was still in
  effect gagged. Two fellow travellers, however, came to his help, others
  became involved, vociferation gave place to pushing and punching, and the
  Nazis, outnumbered, were put off the train.</p>

  <p>Whereupon the young man who had started all the trouble, exasperated,
  heated and dishevelled, and seeing that now altogether intolerable Jew still
  making unsatisfactory passes with his hands and face at the window, drew a
  revolver and shot him dead. Other weapons flashed into action, and the
  miniature battle was brought to an end only by the engine-driver drawing his
  train out of the station. The matter was complicated politically by the fact
  that the exact status of the Danzig police was still in dispute and that the
  Nazis had no legal authority upon the Danzig platform.</p>

  <p>By itself this distressing incident might have been arranged without the
  outbreak of a European war. The moribund League of Nations might have been
  invoked or even the mummified Hague Tribunal galvanized into activity; either
  institution was still fully capable of dealing with, let us say, a Polish
  dentist who might have been treated as the culpable party, traced, punished
  and made the scapegoat of Europe. But that would have needed a certain
  goodwill on the part of the Powers directly involved, and at that time no
  such goodwill was forthcoming.</p>

  <p>For eight years now the German mind had been working up for a fight over
  the Corridor, and the rearmament of Germany, overt and secret, had been going
  on. Both France and Poland had been watching the military recovery of Germany
  with ever-deepening apprehension, and the military authorities of both
  countries were urgent that a blow should be struck while they were still
  disproportionately stronger. Time after time it seemed that the crisis had
  come, and time after time nothing more than a stock-exchange tornado had
  occurred. Now the last reasons for patience had disappeared. The tension had
  risen to a point at which disaster seemed like relief and Europe was free to
  tear itself to fragments.</p>

  <p>Such a situation was the inevitable climax to every "armed peace" in the
  old belligerent world. At some point there was an irresistible logic in
  "Strike now before they get too strong". That had been an underlying motive
  of primary force in the British readiness to fight in 1914. They were eager
  to strike before the ever-growing German fleet equalled their own. So they
  ended an intolerable tension. The Germans had "asked for it", they said.
  "Better now than to-morrow."</p>

  <p>Now again Germany has "asked for it" and Poland was leaping to the
  occasion. The War Offices pressed their bell buttons. The printing machines
  of Paris, London and New York were still busy with various misstatements
  about the murdered commercial traveller, while the Polish and German air
  patrols were in conflict all along the fatal boundary. That dental plate
  apparently began to feel uncomfortable about one o'clock in the afternoon of
  Friday, January 4th, 1940. On Saturday, about three o'clock in the afternoon,
  Michael Koreniovsky, the Polish ace, after a brilliant fight with three
  antagonists, fell flaming out of the sky into the crowded Langgasse of Danzig
  and set fire to the Rathaus.</p>

  <p>The first Polish air raid on Berlin and the unresisted "demonstration
  flight" of two hundred French air squadrons in formation over Bavaria and
  West Prussia followed. The Germans seem to have been taken completely by
  surprise by this display of immense and immediate preparedness. They had not
  thought it of the French. But they had the quickness of apprehension to
  decline an air battle against odds, and the French flew home again. The
  fighting on the Polish-German frontier continued.</p>

  <p>The authorities in Paris were uncertain whether they were disappointed or
  relieved by the non-resistance of their old enemies. A smashing air victory
  over Germany would have been very satisfactory and conclusive, but these
  aeroplanes were also wanted at home to cow the ever-increasing domestic
  discontent. An indecisive battle&mdash;and that was always possible in the
  air&mdash; might have produced serious internal stresses.</p>

  <p>For a week of years from the resumption of armament by Germany in 1933,
  the diplomatic centres of the world had been watching the steady onset of
  this conflict and had been doing nothing to avert it. Now London, Washington,
  Madrid and Geneva became hysterically active. There was a mighty running to
  and fro of ambassadors and foreign ministers. "Delay," said Geneva; though
  there had already been twenty years of delay.</p>

  <p>"Localize the conflict" was a phrase that leapt into vivid prominence. It
  found favour not only in the neutral countries, but in Paris and Berlin. In
  effect "localize the conflict" meant this: it meant that Paris should scrap
  her engagements to Poland and leave the Poles to make what sort of
  arrangements they could between Germany and Russia. For Russia now, by an
  enigmatical silence combined with a prompt mobilization of the Red Army,
  became almost immediately an important piece in the developing international
  game.</p>

  <p>And Paris had soon very excellent reasons for not pushing a conflict with
  Berlin to extremities. The first Frenchman to be killed in the New Warfare
  had been killed already. And he had been killed in the Maritime Alps, shot by
  the bullet of an Italian patrol.</p>

  <p>On Sunday night, January the 6th, while the Polish aeroplanes were
  dropping gas bombs on Berlin, the Italians were administering the same
  treatment to Belgrade. At the same time an identical note had been dispatched
  from Rome to all the Powers giving Italy's reasons for this decisive blow. It
  seemed that between Friday evening and Sunday morning there had been a
  violent recrudescence of Yugo-Slav irreverence. The Fascist agents who had to
  supply the material for grievance and indignation had in fact overdone their
  task to the pitch of caricature. On Saturday the entire Italian population
  found itself roused from its normal preoccupation with its daily budget by
  the terrible intelligence of Mussolini everywhere made bibulous and
  ophthalmious with red paint, of Venetian lions coloured as indelicately as
  baboons and of shamefully overdecorated Roman eagles. Eloquent and
  dishevelled young Fascists, often in tears, protested at every street corner
  against these intolerable indignities and called for war. The cup of
  Yugo-Slav iniquity was full. It was only in later years that astounded
  students, tracing these outrages to their sources, realized how excessively
  that cup had been filled to justify the Fascist invasion.</p>

  <p>Once the Polish and Italian forces had crossed their boundaries the other
  states of Eastern Europe did not wait even to produce an insult before
  launching their offensives. The whole crazy patchwork of Versailles dissolved
  into fighting&mdash;the joyless, frantic fighting of peoples full of hate and
  fear, led blindly to no ends that anyone could foresee. For two straining
  years the theory of localizing the conflict held Russia and France out of the
  fight. A "formula" was found by which France undertook not to intervene on
  the side of her erstwhile allies, on the understanding that Russia by way of
  compensation also refrained from any action against them. Moreover, the trade
  in munitions was to be carried on "impartially". It was a flimsy formula to
  justify a diplomatic default, but it kept warfare away from the Western front
  of Germany for two distressful years. The persistent shooting by Italians
  over the French boundary was difficult to explain away, and indeed it was not
  so much explained away as quietly disregarded. The air fleets of France
  paraded at intervals, to the increasing irritation of all her immediate
  neighbours, but on the whole as a restraining influence. The demonstration
  chilled the foreigner and assuaged the hotheads at home.</p>

  <p>From the outset there was far less enthusiasm for this "localized"
  European war of 1940 than had been displayed by the populations of the
  belligerent countries in 1914. What enthusiasm was displayed was confined to
  the inexperienced young of the middle and upper classes, the youth of the
  Fascisti, Nazi, "public schoolboy" and scoutmaster type. They went about,
  shouting and urgent, in a heavy, sullen and apprehensive atmosphere. No
  nation "leapt to arms". The common soldiers deserted and "fell out"
  incessantly, and these shirkers were difficult to punish, since the "deserter
  mentality" was so widespread, more particularly in the peasant armies of
  Eastern Europe, that it was impossible to shoot offenders. One Posen
  battalion went into battle near Lodz with thirty-nine officers and
  fifty-seven men.</p>

  <p>From the first "economies" marched with the troops. From the first there
  was a threadbare needy quality about the struggle. General orders insisted
  upon "a restrained use of ammunition".</p>

  <p>The actual fighting was, however, on a much higher level, mechanically and
  scientifically, than the Japanese war in China. The military authorities had
  good roads, automobiles, camions, railways, rolling stock, electrical
  material, guns of all sorts, and great air forces available. Behind the
  fronts were chemical and other munition factories in good working order. If
  there were no longer infantry battles there were some brilliant conflicts of
  technicians. The prompt cutting off of East Prussia from any help from main
  Germany by the Permanent Death Gas was an operation far above the technical
  level of any Eastern operations. It was strategically silly but technically
  very successful.</p>

  <p>The first offensive against Berlin was also planned with modern equipment
  and the maximum of contemporary military science. It was to be another "blow
  at the heart", and the Polish general staff relied upon it as firmly as the
  Germans in 1914 had relied upon their march on Paris. Unfortunately for the
  Poles, it had been necessary to consult a number of "experts" in preparing
  this advance; there were leakages through France, through the Czech and
  Swedish munition makers, through Russia, and through domestic treason, and
  the broad outline of the plan was as well known and understood in Berlin as
  it was in Warsaw. The great gas raid on Berlin was indeed terrifying and
  devastating, but the rush of tanks, great caterpillar guns and troops in
  motor transport was held and checked within sixty miles of the German capital
  by an ingenious system of poison-gas barriers&mdash;chiefly Lewisite and Blue
  Cross&mdash;wired mines and "slime pits" of a novel type in the roads and
  open fields. A cavalry raid to the north between Berlin and the sea failed
  disastrously amidst wire, gas and machine-guns; nearly forty thousand men
  were killed, wounded or taken prisoner. Moreover, there had been mistakes in
  the manufacture of the gas masks worn by the Polish troops, and several
  brigades gave way to the persuasion that they had been sold and betrayed. The
  main Polish masses never came into actual contact with the German troops, and
  only their great numerical superiority in aeroplanes saved their repulse from
  becoming a rout.</p>

  <p>The Polish armies rallied and, according to the secondary plan prepared
  for any such failure, extended themselves and dug themselves in along a line
  between Stettin and the Bohemian frontier. Behind the barrier they began a
  systematic reduction of Silesia. Every night an air battle raged over both
  Berlin and Warsaw. It was often an indecisive battle. The Poles had the
  numerical superiority, but the German machines were more efficient and better
  handled. But the Poles had far more of the new aerial torpedoes&mdash;which
  could go to an assigned spot two hundred miles away, drop a large bomb and
  return&mdash; than their adversaries.</p>

  <p>Bohemia, like France, had mobilized but did not immediately enter the war.
  The Czecho-Slovak armies remained in their mountain quadrilateral or lined
  out along the Hungarian front, awaiting the next turn in the game. Austria
  also remained excited but neutral.</p>

  <p>The Southern war opened brilliantly for the Italians, and for some weeks
  it went on without any formal connexion with the Polish conflict. Bulgaria,
  Albania and Hungary also declared war upon Yugo-Slavia, the Italian air
  forces "darkened the sky", and few of the towns in Croatia and Serbia escaped
  an aerial bombardment. The Italian fleet set itself to capture the ports and
  islands of Dalmatia. But the advance of the Italian troops into the hills of
  Slavonia and Croatia was not as rapid as had been expected. Six weeks passed
  before they were able to fight their way to Zagreb.</p>

  <p>The country was a difficult one, ill adapted to the use of gas or
  mechanism, there was no central point at which a decisive blow could be
  struck, and the population had a long tradition of mountain warfare. It did
  not affect these sturdy peasants whether the townsmen were bombed or not.
  They never gave battle; they never exposed themselves in masses, but their
  bullets flew by day and night into the Italian encampments. Many of them went
  to and fro between their fields and the front. Munitions poured in for them
  through Roumania, which, with a big Red Army on its Bessarabian frontier and
  its own peasants recalcitrant, remained also ambiguously, dangerously, and
  yet for a time profitably, out of the struggle. The Hungarians crossed the
  Yugo-Slav frontier and threatened Belgrade, but the mass of their forces
  faced towards Czecho-Slovakia and awaited further events.</p>

  <p>A curious pause in the fighting occurred at the end of the year. The
  frantic efforts of Prague, London and Paris to call a halt were temporarily
  successful. The invaders of Germany and Yugo-Slavia remained upon enemy
  territory, but neutral zones were improvised and there was a cessation of
  hostilities. An eleventh-hour attempt was made to stop the war by negotiation
  and keep the two conflicts from coalescence. There were weeks during which
  this seemed possible. Both Germany and Poland were of two minds about
  continuing the war now that the Polish advance was held, and Italy hoped to
  be left in possession of Dalmatia without an irksome campaign of further
  conquest. It was as if the spirit of civilization had once more come near to
  awakening from its hallucinations and had asked, "Why on earth is this
  happening to us?"</p>

  <p>The British Cabinet thought the occasion opportune for a conference at
  Vevey to revise the Treaty of Versailles "finally". The pacific speeches of
  Duff-Cooper, Hore-Belisha, Ellen Wilkinson and Randolph Churchill echoed
  throughout Europe and were brilliantly supported by Benito Caruso and Corliss
  Lamont in America. The Pope, the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Non-conformist
  Churches, the President of the Swiss Republic and the able and venerable
  President Benes swelled the chorus of remonstrance. France, which had been
  growing steadily more pacificist after her social conflicts in 1934-35, found
  able spokesmen in Louchère and Chavanne. Once again we are reminded of the
  impulses of Henry Ford and Wilson. Once again the concept of a World Pax
  flickered in the human imagination and vanished. This time it was a fuller,
  more explicit and more unanimous chorus than that which had cried aloud in
  1916-17. Yet at the time it was hardly more effective. Vevey prolonged the
  truce throughout 1941 until June, but it could settle nothing. The military
  authorities, having had a breathing-time, became impatient. With a mutually
  destructive malice the fighting was resumed "before the harvest could be
  gathered".</p>

  <p>Vevey failed because the constructive conception of the Modern State had
  no representative there. It was just another gathering of national
  diplomatists who professed to seek peace, and yet who set about the business
  with all those antiquated assumptions of sovereignty that were bound to lead
  to a revival of the conflict. The fantasy of some "balance of power" was as
  near as they ever came to a peace idea. Such a balance was bound to sway from
  year to year and from day to day. Whatever the common people and men of
  intelligence were thinking, the experts now wanted to see the war fought to a
  finish. "The Germans hadn't been beaten enough" was all too acceptable to the
  munition dealers and the Press in France and Scandinavia. "The Italians have
  their hands full in Yugo-Slavia."</p>

  <p>The British and Americans, who hoped to keep out of the conflict to the
  end, had experienced an exhilarating revival of exports and found their bills
  against the belligerents mounting very hopefully. Once more Tyneside echoed
  to hammering; steel, iron and chemical shares boomed and the iron and steel
  industry, like some mangy, toothless old tiger, roused itself for the only
  quarry it had now the vigour to pursue&mdash;man-eating. It had long ceased
  to dream of new liners or bridges or railways or steel-framed houses. But it
  could still make guns and kill. It could not look far enough ahead to reckon
  whether at last there would be any meat on the man's bones. The only
  countries that really wanted peace, enduring peace, were Czecho-Slovakia and
  Austria, which stretched out between the two combatant systems and had
  possible enemy frontiers on every hand. The human will for peace as it found
  expression at Vevey was still a tangled and ineffective will.</p>

  <p>The fighting revived almost simultaneously in the Polish Ukraine, where
  the peasants had revolted and were evidently fighting with Soviet officers
  and equipment, and in a vigorous surprise attack upon the Polish lines to
  free the German soil from the invader. The Germans had been working night and
  day during the truce to equalize conditions in the air; they produced new and
  swifter aeroplanes and a particularly effective machine-gun, and for some
  weeks there was such aerial fighting as was never seen before or since.</p>

  <p>Gradually the Germans established a sufficient ascendancy to bring their
  bombers and gas into play. Lodz and Warsaw were terrorized and the civilian
  population evacuated and the Polish line broken so as to restore
  communications with Silesia. And then the conflict broadened. Lithuania,
  evidently with Russian encouragement, seized her old city of Wilna, and
  Austria linked the Northern and the Southern struggle by entering both wars
  as the ally of Germany and Italy. Germany declared her final union with
  Austria. Very swiftly now the remaining European states followed one another
  into the cauldron. Hungary attacked Eastern Czecho-Slovakia without a
  declaration of war "to restore her legitimate boundaries", and brought the
  army frameworks of Roumania into the field against her. Thereupon Russia
  announced the impossibility of maintaining her understanding with France in
  the face of these events, and the Red Army advanced on Lemberg. Macedonia was
  already a seething mass of fighting, village against village; Bulgaria
  entered the "South Slav" alliance and assailed Albania, and Greece seized
  Rhodes, which had been up to that time held by Italy.</p>

  <p>So France saw her ancient policy of "security", of setting state to
  balance state and allying herself with a countervailing state at the back of
  every antagonistic neighbour, work out to its necessary conclusion. Gladly
  would her business men and her peoples now have rested behind her immensely
  fortified frontiers and shared the profits of neutrality and munition-selling
  with the British and Americans, but her engagements were too binding. After
  one last ambiguous attempt on the part of London, Washington and Geneva to
  avert the disaster, France declared war against the Central European alliance
  in 1943.</p>

  <p>On the face of it the new war resembled the World War of 1914-18. It
  seemed to be an attempt to reverse or confirm the Versailles settlement. It
  had an air of being the same sort of siege of Central Europe. But now Italy
  was in close alliance with the Teutonic powers; Belgium, in a state of
  extreme industrial distress, was out of the war; Britain stood aloof; and in
  the place of her former Allies France had to help&mdash;rather than be
  helped&mdash;by the band of states from the Corridor to the Black Sea and the
  Balkans which the Quai d'Orsay had toiled so painfully to knit into an
  anti-German alliance.</p>

  <p>Russia, however, was a doubtful ally of the Central Powers; she was not
  operating in concert with them; she was simply supporting the new Soviet
  republics in Eastern Poland and Bessarabia. There the Red Army halted. The
  old enthusiasm for a World Revolution had faded out of the Russian
  imagination. Marxism had become so Russianized that it feared now to take in
  too large a contingent of Western adherents. The Kremlin was content to
  consolidate the kindred Slav Soviets and then rest. Japan and China and the
  American continent remained out of the mêlée, concentrated on their own
  social difficulties.</p>

  <p>It would be possible for a superficial student to regard all this merely
  as a rearrangement of the familiar counters of sovereign state politics. But,
  in reality, the forces in collision were profoundly different. France, in
  spite of her internal social stresses, was still a capitalist community of
  the Nineteenth Century type, with democratic parliamentary forms and
  irresponsible finance and industrialism. Save for the teaching of a
  sentimental patriotism, her young people were mentally unorganized. Her
  allies were peasant states with governments of the royal or parliamentary
  form, and, if anything, more old-fashioned. But the Central Powers were all
  of the new Fascist pattern, more closely knit in its structure and dominated
  by an organization of the younger spirits, which claimed to be an élite.</p>

  <p>Except for the fundamentally important fact that these Fascisti were
  intensely nationalist, this control by a self-appointed, self-disciplined
  élite was a distinct step towards our Modern State organization. These
  various Fascisti were destined to destroy their own states and disappear
  because of their essentially shallow and sentimental mentality, their
  inability to get outside nationalist traditions and coalesce; there is no
  direct continuity between them and our modern educational and administrative
  system; but there was nothing like them in the World War of 1914-18 anywhere,
  and they are noteworthy, as the Russian Communist Party (in spite of its
  proletarian formula) is noteworthy, for their partial but very real advance
  on democratic institutions. Amidst the chaos, that organized "devotion of the
  young" on which our modern community rests was clearly foreshadowed in these
  Central European states. The idea of disciplined personal participation in
  human government was being driven into the mentality of the new
  generation.</p>

  <p>Until something more convincing appeared, it had to crystallize,
  disastrously enough, about such strange nuclei as the theatrical Mussolini
  and the hysterical Hitler. It had to be patriotic because that was the only
  form in which the State then presented itself. But after these first
  crystallizations had been shattered and dissolved in the war disasters that
  now ensued, the idea was still there, this idea of banded cooperation ready
  to be directed to greater ends. Youth had ceased to be irresponsible in all
  the Fascist countries.</p>

  <p>Not only were these new wars unlike their predecessors in the fact that
  they were not, so far as the Central Powers were concerned, wars of the
  democratic masses, but also they were quite unprecedented in the range and
  quality of the fighting. We have already indicated some of the main
  differences between the New Warfare and the Old. These now became accentuated
  by the extraordinary way in which the boundaries of the battling states
  interdigitated. In the first spurt of conflict there was indeed a "front"
  between Poland and Germany; but after 1943 there was no front, no main
  objective, and no central idea to the storming destruction that spread over
  Europe.</p>

  <p>The Poles tried to draw a line of Permanent Death Gas across East
  Brandenburg before their withdrawal to Posen, but their collapse came too
  swiftly, and they were able only to poison three small areas of no strategic
  importance. After 1943 the war became mainly a war in the air, with an
  increasing use of gas and landing raids, raids rather than invasions, to
  seize, organize and hold advantageous positions. A bitter and intense naval
  struggle went on in the Mediterranean to cut off reinforcements and supplies
  between North Africa and France, but there was little molestation of the
  Atlantic traffic of France.</p>

  <p>There was never an Aerial Trafalgar, never an Air Ecnomus. War in three
  dimensions does not afford those channels, straits, narrow seas, passes, main
  roads, by which an inferior force may be brought to a decisive battle, and
  indeed to this day it is uncertain which side was absolutely predominant in
  the air. It was a war of raids and reprisals, and no large decisive
  operations were attempted. A big German infantry push into Posen was held by
  gas and slimes, and a French invasion of Italy got no further than Turin.</p>

  <p>The complete exhaustion of the adversary, materially and morally, became
  the only possible road to any sort of victory. Once more the tormented
  populations were urged to sustain a "war of attrition". "It is the man who
  holds out half an hour longer than the other who wins" was translated into
  every European language. The attacks on social order increased in malignancy
  as the impossibility of any military decision became manifest. Crops and
  forests were deliberately fired, embankments smashed, low-lying regions
  flooded, gas and water supplies destroyed. The aviators would start off to
  look for a crowd and bomb it. It became as cruel as the fighting of
  ferrets.</p>

  <p>There was still, in spite of a decade of financial dislocation and
  industrial depression, a vast amount of mechanical material in Europe;
  everywhere there were factories strongly protected against air attack and
  skilfully camouflaged. Moreover, all the chief belligerents had sufficiently
  open frontiers for the importation of material, so long as anything compact
  and valuable could be wrung out of their nationals by tax or levy, to pay for
  such supplies. The goods crossed the frontier at night; the cargoes were
  piloted into unlit harbours. Every able-bodied adult not actually in the
  fighting forces was pressed to work at excavations for bomb shelters and the
  reconstitution of buildings against gas and high explosive. Much of this also
  was night work. Recalcitrance and shirking were punished by a deprivation of
  rations. There is a grim picture by Eglon Callet called "Security at Last",
  of which the reader may have seen reproductions. A chain gang of emaciated
  and ragged Frenchmen is working under the lash in a tunnel. In the foreground
  one who has fainted is being given a stimulant; another, past help, dies
  untended.</p>

  <p>In comparison with the abundant literature of personal experiences in the
  World War, at least so far as the Western front was concerned, there are
  remarkably few records either of combatant or non-combatant adventures during
  the Fighting Forties. The big air raids seem to have been altogether
  horrible. They were much more dreadful than the air raids of the World War.
  They began with a nightmare of warning maroons, sirens, hooters and the
  shrill whistles of cyclist scouts, then swarms of frantic people running to
  and fro, all pride and dignity gone, seeking the nearest shelter and aid, and
  they ended for most of their victims in an extremity of physical
  suffering.</p>

  <p>We have already given some intimation of the nature of those torture
  deaths. In nearly every case the organization of refuges and gas masks broke
  down. In many cases there had never been a real provision, but only sham
  visors and sham bomb-proof buildings to allay "premature" panic and "keep up
  the popular morale". None of these great raids was ever reported in the
  newspapers that still struggled on into the war years. Even in America the
  publication of any detail was treated as "pacificist propaganda against
  recruiting".</p>

  <p>There is a descriptive letter from Berlin after an air raid, undated and
  signed "Sinclair", which is believed by most competent critics to have been
  written by Sinclair Lewis the novelist (1885-1990). One passage may be
  quoted:</p>

  <p>"We went down Unter den Linden and along the Sieges Allee, and the bodies
  of people were lying everywhere, men, women and children, not scattered
  evenly, but bunched together very curiously in heaps, as though their last
  effort had been to climb on to each other for help. This attempt to get close
  up to someone seems to be characteristic of death by this particular gas.
  Something must happen in the mind. Everyone was crumpled up in the same
  fashion and nearly all had vomited blood. The stench was dreadful, although
  all this multitude had been alive twenty-four hours ago. The body corrupts at
  once. The archway into the park was almost impassable...."</p>

  <p>So we get one glimpse of how peaceful town-bred people might die a century
  and a half ago.</p>

  <p>The individual stories of the actual fighting in that last warfare are no
  more ample than the non-combatant descriptions. There was little inducement
  for anyone to write about it in the subsequent decades; there was not the
  same high proportion of literate men as there was in the Western armies
  during the Great War; there was a less artless interest in what was happening
  and more running away, desertion, apathy, drunkenness, raping, plundering and
  malignant cruelty, which are not things of which men leave records. The whole
  world was less sensitive than it had been thirty years before; if it suffered
  more grossly it suffered less acutely. In 1914-15 many of the British and
  German rankers kept diaries from day to day. This shows a sense of
  personality and a receptiveness to events quite outside the sullen fatalism,
  shot with gleams of primitive exaltation or fury, which seems to have been
  the prevalent state of mind in the armies of the Forties.</p>

  <p>In the Historical Documents Series there is a diary of a Japanese officer
  who was killed in the retreat from Wuchang. Failing any European material of
  the same kind, it may perhaps be quoted here to show how it felt to fight in
  the last wars of all. It is not, however, a very vivid document. He was an
  intellectual, a socialist and a strong believer in the League of Nations, and
  his record is mainly a series of hostile criticisms in cypher of the superior
  command. But in the latter half these dissertations die out. The diary
  becomes a broken record of what he found to eat and drink and how he fought
  against influenza and dysentery. He seems to have had a company of men with
  him; he notes twice when he contrived a haul of food for them, and he jots
  down names as they are killed or missing. There are also figures that may be
  a note of his diminishing ammunition. He was already badly starved when he
  was killed. As he weakened he seems to have found his rather complicated
  cypher too difficult to use, and he lapsed first into bad English and then
  into plain Japanese. The very last item is an unfinished poem, a fragment in
  the old style, which might be rendered as follows:</p>

  <p>Almond blossom in the spring sunshine, Fuji-Yama gracious lady, Island
  treasure home of lovely things, Shall I never see you again?...</p>

  <p>Something, death perhaps, prevented the completion of his naive verses. He
  and his detachment were probably overtaken and done to death near Kai-
  feng.</p>

  <p>In none of these later war memoirs is there anything to recall that queer
  quality of the 1914-18 stories, of men who felt they were going out from
  absolutely sure and stable homes and cities, to which with reasonable good
  fortune they would return&mdash;and live happily ever afterwards. The mood
  then was often extraordinarily brave and tender. The men of this later cycle
  of wars felt that there would be no such home-coming. They knew that they
  went out to misery and left misery in active possession at home. Their war
  was not an expedition; it was a change for ever. The memoirs of the airmen
  who did so much destruction are amazingly empty. They note fights, but quite
  flatly. "Put down two Polaks", for example; "a close shave"; but they do not
  seem to have had an inkling of the effect of the bombs they dropped upon the
  living flesh below. Many of these young men survived to become Modern State
  aviators and to serve the Air and Sea Control after 1965. But though some
  wrote well of their later experiences, none of them has left any useful
  documents for the history of the war time. The historian turns to his dates,
  maps and totals again from this meagre salvage of the hopes, fears, dreads,
  curiosities and agonies of the millions who went through that age of cruel
  disaster, doubtful whether he is sorry or thankful that most of that welter
  of feeling and suffering has vanished now as completely as though it had
  never been.</p>

  <p>After 1945 the signs of exhaustion multiplied. Such despair had come to
  the souls of men that even defensive energy failed. They lay starving in
  their beds and hovels and let the bombs fall about them. But a whiff of gas
  could still cause a panic, a headlong rush of tormented people coughing and
  spitting through the streets to the shelter pits. Influenza with its peculiar
  intensity of mental depression came again repeatedly after 1942, and in 1945
  came cholera. These epidemics, though they seemed grave enough at the time,
  were the mere first scouts of that great "Raid of the Germs" which was in
  preparation for disunited humanity. It was as if they were testing the
  defensive organization of mankind.</p>

  <p>Except for air warfare, Britain and the North European neutrals were
  suffering almost as acutely as if they were actually at war. They had poured
  munitions into Europe and reaped a harvest of bad debts. After the first
  economic exhilaration due to this state of employment, the exports from Great
  Britain, which had once been the pioneer of free world trade and cosmopolitan
  thought, dwindled to insignificance; the erstwhile creditor of the world
  could not collect such debts as were still due to her, and could not pay
  therefore for the food supply of her dwindling but still excessive
  population. Her former sanitation had rotted to filthiness under a régime of
  relentless saving. Housing in that disagreeable climate had passed from
  congestion to horror. The first cholera epidemic found her in the throes not
  only of famine but of civil disorder, controlled and suppressed by her highly
  mechanized army and by the still very powerful habits of orderliness and
  subordination in her people. Never, since the Black Death of the Fifteenth
  Century, had the British Isles known such a pestilence. They had believed the
  days of pestilence were past for ever. And yet that cholera was only the
  precursor of the still more terrible experiences that were to follow it in
  the subsequent decade.</p>

  <p>Slowly but surely the spirit of protest and mutiny spread through Europe.
  That growing despairful insubordination that had done so much to bring about
  the winding up of the World War in 1918 reappeared in new forms. But because
  now war was no longer primarily an infantryman's business, mass mutiny, such
  as had crippled the French offensives after 1917, taken Russia out of the
  war, and led to the final German collapse, had not now the same disabling
  effect. There were not the same big aggregations of men under exasperating
  discipline and in touch with "subversive" suggestions. Power had passed over
  to the specialized forces &mdash;to the aviators and war technicians. By the
  use of small bombs, machine-guns and the milder gases they could "handle" and
  disperse mass meetings and "tranquillize" insurgent districts in a manner
  that would have been inconceivable to the street barricade revolutionaries of
  the later Eighteenth Century.</p>

  <p>Even strikes in the munition factories were no longer so effective as they
  had been, because even there the increased efficiency of power production had
  ousted the comparatively unskilled worker in his multitudes. For the same
  reason the propaganda of insurrectionary class-war communism, though it now
  dominated the thought of nine-tenths of the European peasants and workers,
  found unexpected obstacles in its attempts to seize control of affairs. It
  could not repeat the Russian social revolution because the new conditions
  were entirely different. The Bolshevik success had been possible only through
  the backwardness of Russia and the absence of a technically educated social
  stratum. The unrest and insubordination of the common people in Central and
  Western Europe could and did produce immense passive resistances and local
  revolutionary movements, but it found opposed to it a whole system of
  aviators, mechanics, technicians, scientific workers and so forth who had
  learnt from Red Russia what sort of direction and planning to expect from a
  proletariat led by party politicians. Whatever they thought about their own
  governments&mdash;and already they were beginning to think in a very fresh
  and vigorous fashion about them&mdash;it was not towards democratic communism
  that the minds of the scientific and technical workers were turning.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, with the help of organizers from Russia, the protest of
  humanity against the prolongation of the New Warfare took for a time the form
  of communist risings. In 1947, in Marseilles, St. Etienne, Paris, Barcelona,
  Milan, Naples, Hamburg, Lodz and Glasgow there were mutinies of troops under
  arms and risings sufficiently formidable to sustain provisional Soviets for
  periods varying from a week to several months. The Hamburg and Glasgow
  Soviets were the best organized and held out longest, collapsing only after
  considerable bloodshed. Almost everywhere there were minor incidents of the
  same character. And the formal suspension of the war by the responsible
  governments concerned was certainly due more than anything else to their
  terror of a general social revolt. As the material organization of the system
  was shattered, as the behaviour of the technicians became uncertain, the
  threatening visage of the class-vindictive proletarian drew nearer and nearer
  to the face of the stockbroker, the war-monger, the banker, the traditional
  ruler.</p>

  <p>It took nearly three years to end the last war. The Conference of London
  in 1947 did its best to work out a stable settlement of Europe on the lines
  of the Versailles Treaty, but the politicians and diplomatists were still
  incapable of the frankness and generosity needed. Face-saving was so much
  more important than life-saving to these creatures that they actually allowed
  the now pointless hostilities to be renewed in 1948.</p>

  <p>In the spring of 1949, however, at Prague, President Benes achieved what
  had seemed to be the impossible, and brought the fighting to an end. He did
  this by inventing a phrase and suggesting, instead of a treaty, a "Suspension
  of Hostilities". Each Power was to remain in possession of the territory it
  occupied, and there was to be no further fighting pending the assembly of an
  unspecified Conference to be organized later. Influenza, cholera, and at last
  maculated fever, the progressive enfeeblement of economic life and new
  developments of human relationship, prevented that Conference from ever
  meeting. The Benes Suspension of Hostilities became a permanent suspension.
  It endures to this day.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap2_10"
     name="chap2_10">10. &mdash; THE RAID OF THE GERMS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">That same dearth of detailed description which takes the
  colour out of the history of the last wars becomes even more apparent in the
  records of the epidemics that made any resumption of that warfare impossible.
  Diaries, letters and descriptive writing were out of fashion; there were
  other things to do and no surplus energy in the brain. It is as if the
  micro-organisms had taken a leaf out of the book of the Foreign Offices and
  found in mankind's confusion an opportunity for restoring the long-lost
  empire of the germs.</p>

  <p>The attack began in the best style without a declaration of war. The first
  line of advance consisted of a variety of influenzas, impoverishing fevers,
  that were highly infectious and impossible to control under war conditions.
  The depleted strength of the belligerent populations, a depletion due to
  their reduced and disorganised nourishment and the collapse of their sanitary
  services, gave these infections full scope; they killed some millions and
  diminished the already lowered vitality of the great populations still
  further. That lowering of the general vitality was far more important than
  the actual mortality. Cholera and bubonic plague followed, and then, five
  years and more later, when the worst seemed to have passed, came the
  culminating attack by maculated fever.</p>

  <p>This obscure disease, hitherto known only as a disease of captive baboons,
  seems to have undergone some abrupt adaptation to the kindred habitat of the
  human body; possibly there was some intermediate host which prepared the
  bacilli for their attack on mankind. Or it may be that the preceding
  epidemics had changed some hitherto defensive element in human blood. We are
  still quite in the dark upon these points because at that time there were no
  doctors or biologists with the leisure to record observations, even had they
  had time to make them, and scientific publications had ceased to appear
  anywhere.</p>

  <p>The disease appeared first in the vicinity of the London Zoological
  Gardens and spread thence with incredible rapidity. It discoloured the face
  and skin, produced a violent fever, cutaneous irritation and extreme mental
  distress, causing an uncontrollable desire to wander. Then the bodily energy
  vanished in collapse and the victim lay down and died. The fever was not
  simply infectious through water, but transmitted by the almost impalpable
  scabs scratched off by the sufferer. Wind, water and the demented sick
  carried it everywhere. About half humanity was vulnerable, and so far as we
  know now all who were vulnerable took it, and all who took it died.</p>

  <p>So the world's malaise culminated in the terrible eighteen months between
  May 1955 and November 1956, at which latter date Nature with a pitiless but
  antiseptic winter came to the rescue of the human remnant. No effectual cure
  was ever devised for this fever and no helpful palliative. It swept the whole
  world and vanished as enigmatically as it came. It is still a riddle for
  pathologists. It no longer affects even the surviving baboon population, so
  that investigators can make no cultures, nor attempt any experiments. There
  is no material. It came, it destroyed, and it seems to have at last committed
  suicide with some unknown anti-body of its production. Or the real disease,
  as Mackensen believes, may have been not the maculated fever at all, but the
  state of vulnerability to its infection. That vulnerability had spread
  unsuspected throughout the world, he thinks, in the warring forties. The
  actual pestilence was not the disease but the harvest of a weakness already
  prepared.</p>

  <p>History is like the individual memory in this, that it tends to obliterate
  disagreeable experiences. One of the most nonsensical things that was ever
  said was that a country is happy that has no history. On the contrary, it is
  only the really secure and prosperous phases that have left anything like
  sufficient material for historical reconstruction. We know of the pleasant
  social life of all the centuries of abundance in Egypt; we know the greatness
  and conquests of Assyria; the court-life of Ajanta and Central Asia is
  pictured for us to share; but the days of military disaster leave nothing but
  a band of ashes, and the years of pestilence merely break the continuities of
  the record. There is a good account of the Plague of London (1665) written by
  Defoe (1659-1731), and the unwary reader has to be warned that that account
  was compiled and fabricated many years after the event by an ingenious writer
  who was not even an eye-witness. There is a painting by Raphael of the plague
  in Rome which is similarly reminiscent. Most of the great plagues of history
  took their dead and departed unportrayed. What concerns history is the
  subsequent social and economic dislocation. On that Clio becomes copious
  again. What goes on again matters to her, but what is dead is dead.</p>

  <p>The flowering prosperity of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries
  has left us an almost uncontrollable mass of record about people who knew
  nothing except by hearsay of the more frightful experiences of mankind. We
  have novels, letters, diaries, memoirs, pictures, photographs and so on by
  the million. But there survives hardly a letter, no pictures, and not a book
  or newspaper to throw light on those years 1955 and 1956, little more than a
  century and a third ago, which were certainly the most terrible through which
  our race ever passed. What was written at the time was destroyed as
  infectious. Afterwards it was left for a new generation of Defoes and Stephen
  Cranes to contrive a picture.</p>

  <p>The descriptions of Cable, Nath Dass, Bodesco and Martini seem to be
  fairly justifiable, and to these fictions the reader is referred. They ring
  the changes upon not only villages but towns and cities with none but dead
  men and women in them; people lying unburied and gnawed by packs of hungry
  dogs and solitary cats; in India the tigers and in Africa the lions came into
  the desolate streets, and in Brazil the dead population of whole districts
  was eaten chiefly by wild hog, which multiplied excessively. Rats swarmed,
  and with an unwonted boldness threatened even the immune.</p>

  <p>One terror which is never omitted is the wandering of the infected.
  Nothing would induce them to remain in bed or hospital; nothing could keep
  them from entering towns and houses that were as yet immune. Thousands of
  these dying wanderers were shot by terror-stricken people whom they
  approached. That dreadful necessity horrifies us to-day as much as that other
  grim act of self-protection: the survivors in the boats of the big steamship
  Titanic which struck an iceberg in 1912, beating at the knuckles of the
  drowning men and women who clung to the sides and threatened to swamp them.
  For awhile, under such desperate and revealing stresses, man ceased to obey
  the impulses of a social animal. Those of the population who resisted the
  infection&mdash;and with maculated fever the alternatives were immunity or
  death&mdash;gave way to a sort of despair and hatred against the filthy
  suffering around them. Only a few men with medical, military, priestly or
  police training seem to have made head against the disaster and tried to
  maintain a sort of order. Many plundered. On the whole, so far as the
  evidence can be sifted, women behaved better than men, but some few women who
  joined the looters were terrible.</p>

  <p>This nightmare came and passed.</p>

  <p>In January 1957, people were walking about in the deserted towns, breaking
  into empty houses, returning to abandoned homes, exploring back streets
  littered with gnawed bones or fully-clad skeletons, and they were still
  unable to realize that the wrath of Nature was over and life still before
  them.</p>

  <p>Maculated fever had put gas warfare in its place. It had halved the
  population of the world.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap2_11"
     name="chap2_11">11. &mdash; EUROPE IN 1960</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The more advanced student of history finds it necessary to
  work out in detail the local variations of the process by which the great
  patchwork of empires and nationalist states, set up during the Age of
  European Predominance, lost its defining lines, lost its contrasted cultures
  and its elaborated traditions, and ceased to divide the allegiance and
  devotion of men of goodwill. It was still standing&mdash;a hollow shell in
  1933; in 1966 it had gone. It crumpled up, it broke down; its forms melted
  together and disappeared.</p>

  <p>For the purposes of general education, the intricate interplay of
  personalities and accidents in this world débâcle can be passed over, as we
  pass over the details of the Great War or of Napoleon's various military
  campaigns, and as Gibbon, the author of the Decline and Fall of the Roman
  Empire (published between 1776 and 1788) passed over a thousand years of
  Byzantine court life. Nowadays that sort of history has become a mine for
  those admirable biographical studies which are ousting the old romantic novel
  from the entertainment of our leisure so soon as our imaginations have passed
  beyond the purely romantic stage. All that is needed for our present purpose
  is some understanding of the broader forces that were operating through this
  lush jungle of human reactions.</p>

  <p>The tempo of human affairs increases continually, and the main difference
  between the decline and fall of the Roman system and the decline and fall of
  the world rule of private-profit capitalism in the Twentieth Century lies in
  the far more rapid onset and development of the later collapse. A second
  important difference is the much livelier understanding of what was happening
  on the part of the masses involved. Each of these two great depressions in
  the record of human well-being was primarily a monetary breakdown, due to the
  casual development of financial and proprietary law and practice without any
  reference to a comprehensive well-being, and to the lag in political and
  educational adaptation which left the whole system at last completely without
  guidance. But while the former débâcle went to the pace of the horse on the
  paved road and of the written and spoken word, the phases of the new downfall
  flashed about the globe instantaneously and evoked a body of thought and
  reaction out of all comparison greater than the Roman precedent. So we see
  only a much compressed and abbreviated parallelism. From the demoralization
  of the deflated Roman Empire by the great plagues at the end of the second
  century of the Christian era, to the reappearance of commerce, industry, art
  and politeness in the cities of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, was
  well over a thousand nerveless years; from the invasion of Belgium by the
  Germans in 1914 to the return of general material prosperity under the Air
  Dictatorship after 2010 was roughly a century.</p>

  <p>The mental process, if for this reason alone, was much more continuous. It
  got to its conclusions while still in contact with its premises. The first
  world collapse was spread over a number of generations, each one oblivious of
  the experiences of its predecessor, but the larger and swifter part of the
  second world collapse fell well within the compass of a single long life.
  People who could remember the plentiful and relatively stable times between
  1924 and 1928 as young men and women were still only at the riper end of
  middle age in 1960. Many who were children at the onset of the Hoover Slump
  were taking an active part in affairs in the days of the first international
  police, the Police of the Air and Sea Ways. It was possible to grasp what was
  happening as one whole. It is doubtful if any Roman citizen under the Empire
  ever grasped what was happening.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless in each case there was a parallel obliteration of old ideas,
  the same effacement of boundaries, the same destruction of time-honoured
  traditions, the lapsing of debts and obligations, the disappearance of
  religious and educational organizations, the impoverishment of favoured and
  privileged classes, the recrudescence of lawlessness, the cleansing
  disillusionment. Each was the effectual liquidation of a bankrupt
  civilization preparatory to a drastic reconstruction.</p>

  <p>We will now take a sort of rough cross-section of the world at about the
  date of 1960 C.E., and consider the condition of the main masses of the
  world's population and the great forces at work among them. In the light of
  subsequent events we can realize that there was already a very considerable
  convergence of conditions going on throughout the middle decades of the
  century. But it may be doubted whether that was evident at the time. The goal
  towards which the fundamental bionomic forces were driving was everywhere the
  same, but the particulars varied widely with the geographical, ethnic and
  traditional circumstances, and their immediate interpretations were even more
  diverse.</p>

  <p>We have viewed the events of the Era of European Predominance as the
  outcome of an uncontrolled irregularity in growth, of economic hypertrophy in
  a phase of political and cultural atrophy. An immense increase in the energy
  of human society had occurred which had relieved itself partly in a great
  multiplication of the human population (Europe from 180 to 420 millions
  between 1800 and 1914, says Werner Sombart, in spite of a great emigration),
  partly in a monstrous exaggeration of warfare, and less considerably in an
  increased fullness and speed of the individual life. But, as we have related,
  the forces of conservativism and functional resistance embodied in the
  creditor and legal systems were presently able to give pause to the release
  of fresh energy. For the second time in human experience the inadaptable
  quality of the financial and proprietary organization produced a
  strangulation and an arrest.</p>

  <p>The money and credit organization of the prosperity of the nineteenth
  century differed in many respects from, and was more elaborate than, the
  Roman, but its life history was essentially the same. It wound itself up in
  the same fashion. First came a vast expansion and increase of private
  fortunes and then destructive taxation. So far history repeated itself. The
  European system, like the Roman system before it, impoverished itself finally
  by the violent expenditure of its vast windfall of energy. It repeated the
  same blind story of wastage, but with the unprecedented headlong facilities
  science afforded it. It ran through its available fortune and was helplessly
  in debt in a few decades. The height of its expenditure was between 1914 and
  1950. Thereafter the pace was less catastrophic.</p>

  <p>Regarded even as destruction the New Warfare proved in the end to be a
  failure. It went to pieces when it was attempted. It did not kill as it might
  have killed&mdash;which is why the reader is alive to read this history. The
  actual battles of the European wars in the Forties&mdash;the purely military
  operations, that is to say&mdash;in all their ramifications cost mankind
  hardly a quarter of the battle slaughters of 1914-1918. And yet they mark the
  highest level of scientific fighting ever attained by mankind. The Asiatic
  troubles had been more destructive because they were nearer the barbaric
  level, but even there the actual deaths in warfare are estimated as under
  nine million. Of these, nearly five million are to be ascribed to the final
  offensive of Japan in 1938, the deadlock in Central China, the desperate
  fighting with the Kuomintang levies west of Hankow, and the subsequent
  retreat.</p>

  <p>Man had fallen as short as all that of the magnificent horrors he had
  anticipated. He had failed to raise war to its ultimate mechanical level. The
  social and political dislocation following upon these two main struggles was
  indeed proportionately far greater than the disorder of 1917-1919, but
  warfare was its prelude rather than its cause. This New Warfare, which the
  prophets had said would end in a scientific massacre of mankind, passed
  insensibly into a squalor of political fiascos, unpayable debts, unsubscribed
  loans, scrapped machinery, insurrection, guerilla and bandit conflicts,
  universal hunger and the great pestilences. Gas Warfare and Air War faded out
  of the foreground of human experience, dwarfed and overwhelmed by the more
  primitive realities of panic, famine and fever. The ultimate victor in the
  middle twentieth century was the germ of maculated fever. The main causes in
  the fall of the world's population from about two thousand million in 1930 to
  a little under half that total in 1960 were diseases or simple starvation,
  arising directly from the complete economic collapse. Where war slew its
  millions in a few great massacres, pestilence slew its hundreds of millions
  in a pitiless pursuit that went on by day and night for two terrific
  years.</p>

  <p>As Imhoff has said, there is no single European history of these Famished
  and Pestilential Fifties which followed so swiftly on the war years; there
  are ten million histories. The various governments created by the Treaty of
  Versailles were for the most part still legally in existence throughout this
  age, but with the monetary cessation they had become so faded and ineffective
  that they had ceased to have any great influence on everyday life. Some, like
  the British and the French, limited their activities to
  efforts&mdash;generally quite futile efforts, at tax-collecting; they went on
  finally in a way which will remind the student of the old tribute-levying
  Empires before the Helleno-Latin period. They interfered spasmodically with
  local affairs, but for the most part they let them drift. They ignored or
  compromised with active resistance. The British government was still, it
  seems, paying arrears upon its various loans, in 1952, to such stockholders
  as it was able to trace. The records are obscure; the payments seem to have
  been made in a special paper currency without real purchasing power. Other
  governments, like the Italian and Spanish, carried on as real administrative
  bodies within restricted areas. Rome, for instance, remained in fairly
  effective control of the triangle marked out by Genoa, Florence and the
  Mediterranean Coast, and Barcelona and Madrid kept order throughout most of
  the Peninsula except the Sovietized Spanish Riviera, Portugal and
  Andalusia.</p>

  <p>The process in America was roughly parallel. Detachment was easier so soon
  as the bankrupt railways ceased to operate there, because the distances
  between population centres were greater and the capacity of the people for
  local autonomy much greater. They were still not a century from pioneering.
  The railways never resumed after the pestilence. The authority of the Federal
  Government of the United States shrank to Washington, very much as the
  Eastern Empire shrank to Byzantium, but Washington had none of the vitality
  of Byzantium, and it was already a merely historical capital long before the
  revival of tourism towards 2000. Germany as a unity did not survive the
  Polish wars, and Berlin dwindled rapidly to the status of a group of villages
  amidst the ruins of the Polish aerial bombardments.</p>

  <p>The practical effacement of these bankrupt political systems in a few
  years, the equally rapid drying up of general transport and communications,
  the crescendo of the monetary breakdown, the speedy degeneration of military
  organizations, threw back the tasks of social order upon such local and
  regional leading as still existed. They found themselves astonishingly called
  upon. In Europe, as all over the world throughout this extraordinary decade,
  towns, cities, rural districts, discovered themselves obliged to "carry on"
  by themselves. The plague only drove home that imperative need. The municipal
  authorities organized such health services as they could against the
  infection, or gave way to emergency bodies that took things out of their
  hands. When the plague disappeared, they were like shipwrecked sailors on a
  strange island; they had to reconstitute their shrunken economic life. They
  used old authority for new needs and old terms for new things. Here it would
  be an energetic leader who called himself the Mayor or the Duke, here a
  resolute little band, self-styled the Town Council or the Citizens' Union.
  Here "advanced" terminology prevailed, and it was a "Soviet of Workers" which
  took control. In effect the latter would be very similar to a Citizens'
  Union. Its chief distinction was its consciousness of being in a new social
  phase.</p>

  <p>There was the most extraordinary variation in the political structure of
  this phase of dislocation, and a flat contradiction between the actual and
  the "legal" controls. Across South Germany, Poland and North France, the
  prevalent impression was one of social revolution, and Soviets were in
  fashion. But they were very different in character from the original local
  Russian Soviets. It was possible to find a Communist district referring
  itself vaguely to Moscow, lying side by side with another that was under the
  control of its former owners and employers and professed to be, and often
  was, still in communication with the national government in the capital. An
  uneasy truce would be maintained between these theoretically antagonistic
  systems. Deputations would go for authority in various disputes&mdash;arrears
  of taxes in hand&mdash;to Westminster, Paris or Rome, very much as the
  barbarian chiefs of the Early Mediaeval period would upon due occasion refer
  to Byzantium or Rome. Local conflicts and revolutions were constantly
  occurring. They were recognized at the capitals only as local riots and
  municipal readjustments.</p>

  <p>Scattered through this disarticulating Europe were the vestiges of the old
  militarism, broken fragments of unpaid armies with irreplaceable weapons and
  a dwindling supply of ammunition. They consisted of the officers who were
  soldiers by profession, and the levies who had not been disbanded or who had
  refused to be disbanded because there was no employment for them outside the
  ranks. These men had their officers very much under control because of the
  great facilities for desertion. In some cases these shrivelled military
  forces were in contact with the capital and the old legal government, and
  conducted, or attempted to conduct, tax requisitions and suchlike surviving
  functions of the old order; in other instances they became frankly brigand
  forces, though often with high-sounding titles, Public Order Guards of the
  Emergency Army. Most merged with the local police of aggressive Mayors or
  councils. Small wars of conquest went on in the early Sixties. Old empires
  and sovereign states reappeared, in duplicate or triplicate, and vanished or
  became something else. After 1960 there were even quasi-military forces
  levying contributions, keeping a sort of order, and professing to be Modern
  State nuclei. They would occupy the old barracks and accommodation of
  garrison towns.</p>

  <p>In the Forties these soldiers had been raw recruits. In the following
  decades those who remained in their old formations became formidable middle-
  aged rascals in patched and shabby and supplemented uniforms. Some of the
  commandants had gained control of local aerodromes and local munition
  factories, but everywhere the military found themselves more and more out of
  sympathy with the technical workers they needed to make these acquisitions
  effective. They degenerated to the level of the nineteenth century infantry
  and were at last glad to get even a few thousand roughly made cartridges to
  replenish their supply.</p>

  <p>Under the necessity of doing things for themselves, people did things for
  themselves that they had left to the central government for a century. Even
  during the World War, and in the year or so of stress that followed it,
  various French Chambers of Commerce had supplemented the deficiency in small
  change by local token coinages. Now this practice reappeared widely. Today
  our museums contain hundreds of thousands of specimens of these improvised
  European coins of lead, nickel, tin and all sorts of alloys, jetons or checks
  of wood, and tons of signed, printed paper notes, useful in the local market,
  acceptable for rents and local taxes, but of no avail at all at a distance of
  a few score miles. The local bank manager as often as not would improvise a
  local credit system in cooperation with the local solicitor; the doctors
  would contrive a way of getting along without the Home Office. There were
  still printers' establishments in most centres of population, and for some
  years local periodicals, often of considerable originality, appearing weekly
  or monthly and printed on the roughest and most variable paper, supplied all
  that remained alive of the European Press. But their foreign news amounted to
  little more than rumour. The great Press agencies were bankrupt and dead; the
  telegraph organization was out of gear.</p>

  <p>Save in a few exceptional centres, the diffusion of news by radio died out
  completely. The manufacture of receiving sets was entirely disorganized. From
  1930 to 1970 the "ether" for all except the special purposes of air transport
  was still. There is a long and interesting study in the Historical Record
  Series of the vicissitudes of posts, telegraphs and telephones between 1950
  and 1980. There seem to have been extraordinary survivals. Apparently London,
  Paris and Rome were in telephonic communication almost without a break, and
  the news of the great London landslide was telephoned to Madrid and thence
  radioed to Buenos Ayres in 1968. But that may have been a revival connected
  with the new Sea and Air Control.</p>

  <p>The disappearance not only of radio sets but of an enormous variety of
  small conveniences and appliances was extraordinarily rapid after the
  collapse of world trade. Photography, for instance, was wiped out almost at
  once. The bicycle became rare, and the old pneumatic tyre was replaced by a
  thin solid one of often very badly adulterated "remade" rubber. Electric
  lighting flickered out and vanished for want of the proper material for
  filaments. All electrical material deteriorated, and tramway systems either
  fell into complete disuse or returned to horse traction.</p>

  <p>Ordinary life had been lowering its standards bit by bit from the World
  War onward. First one thing went and then another. Neither in the British nor
  the French provinces did the housing of the common people recover from the
  cessation of building during the actual warfare. Except in places like Berlin
  or Vienna where there had been a vigorous outbreak of post-war building which
  provided accommodation in excess for the shrunken population, the mass of
  Europeans were even more congested and dirty in their domestic accommodation
  than they had been before the conflict, though indeed they never sank to the
  immemorial squalor and poverty of the Chinese and Indian towns. Cleanliness
  diminished at such a pace as to be noted even by the newspapers after 1933.
  There are constant complaints of the dirtiness of the streets and the bad
  repair of the roads, and regretful comparisons with the trim orderliness of
  twenty years before.</p>

  <p>Clothing declined with housing. The clothing trade shrank steadily per
  head of population for nearly forty years. The city crowds, in spite of the
  more and more abundant uniforms (until 1950), lost nearly all their former
  brightness and élan. People patched up their old clothing for want of new,
  and rags became increasingly common. The supply of boots was very restricted.
  The mass production of boots had been commandeered at the outbreak of the war
  and was never turned back to commercial use because of the complete financial
  ruin that ensued. But the old-fashioned shoemakers had been driven off the
  face of Europe long before by this mass production, and so throughout the
  Famished Fifties the Europeans were very painfully shod. Spain had the best
  boots and France and Britain took to sandals&mdash;and chilblains. A certain
  manufacture of footwear went on in some centre in Bohemia, now untraceable,
  and next to Spain ranked Central Europe in the order of shoe welfare. There
  was an extreme scarcity of hats everywhere.</p>

  <p>There was also a universal decline in the little comforts and accessories
  of life to which the world had grown accustomed. Except in a few favoured
  regions where it was actually grown, tobacco disappeared. The mass production
  of cigarettes died out, and those who smoked, smoked pipes of substitute.
  Real tea became a great rarity, and sugar was scarce. Dietetic diseases and
  diseases of under-nutrition increased.</p>

  <p>During the strain and effort of the Great War most of the Europeans had
  already learnt something of contrivance and makeshift. Now they were to have
  a decade of domestic management under difficulties. The Germans were already
  familiar with the word Ersatz; there was much technical knowledge and ability
  diffused among them; and it is indisputable that they contrived to keep much
  nearer comfort than the rest of the world during these dismal years. They
  devised substitute leather, substitute cotton, substitute coffee and tea,
  substitute tobacco, substitute quinine and opium, and a very respectable list
  of other substitute drugs.</p>

  <p>At the other extreme were the shiftless Irish. Until the return of
  production their physical misery was very great indeed. One observer doubted
  if there were a million yards of new cloth produced in that country between
  1950 and 1960. "They live," he reported, "on buttermilk, potatoes, whisky and
  political excitement. They have contrived garments of woven straw, often very
  picturesquely dyed, which they call Early Erse and of which they boast
  inordinately, and they warm themselves by means of fires of peat and dung and
  a great warmth of mutual invective." This sounds quite barbaric. Yet it is to
  this period that we owe the graceful&mdash;though, according to a recent
  Historical Documents report, rather rickety&mdash;Church of the Atonement,
  built on the site of the Dublin Royal College of Science after that had been
  suppressed by the Censorship of 1939 for "teaching biology in a manner
  tending to disintegrate the Holy Trinity".</p>

  <p>The student must be more or less familiar with the representations of this
  period in that useful compilation Historical Scenes in a Hundred Volumes, and
  he has probably read a number of romances and stories of this time. Actual
  photographs are least abundant in the later fifties and early sixties. There
  were still plenty of cameras in the world, but the supply of films seems to
  have died out after 1955, and there are hardly any but slow wet-plate
  exposures after that time for nearly ten years. We get only a few score of
  such animated snapshots as were abundant during the preceding decades, and
  there are no European cinematograph films at all. Neither was there much
  sketching except of single figures, and so the editors have had to supplement
  their material by very carefully studied drawings and photographed
  restorations made at a later date.</p>

  <p>There are six interesting snapshots of scenes in Lyons in 1959. Someone
  seems to have found a spool of film and been able to develop it. One shows
  the big central square, the Place Bellecour as it was called, on a market
  day. Earlier pictures show a big bronze equestrian figure of Louis XIV, but
  this had already disappeared, probably it had been melted for its metal; and
  the windows of some of the big buildings, formerly hotels and hospitals, in
  the background have the empty frameless look of gutted houses. But the scene
  is quite a busy one. It was probably the monthly market, and there is a
  considerable amount of cattle, numerous horses being traded, hurdled sheep,
  many goats and a row of pig-pens. The people are mostly peasants wearing
  straw hats and either very old coats or in some cases shawls wrapped about
  them. Townspeople are still wearing the clothing of the 'thirties, shabby and
  patched, and there are three market officials or magistrates in the old-world
  top hat. In the foreground a bearded man leads a couple of oxen harnessed to
  a small "runabout" car in which a corpulent woman sits in front with a crate
  of ducklings while behind is a netted calf. The lady smiles broadly at the
  camera, unaware that she is smiling at posterity.</p>

  <p>Another of these snapshots shows a bowls competition in the deserted
  railway station. It is clearly a festive occasion, and several games are in
  progress. The rails have disappeared from the tracks, which have been
  levelled for the game, and the ponies and mules of the players are tethered
  on the platform in a long line. The doors of the various bureaus have been
  taken away but the inscriptions Chef de Gare, Salle d'Attente, Restaurant,
  are still faintly visible. There are two long tables on one of the middle
  platforms on which simple refreshments are being served. A third picture
  shows a crowd staring at the ruins of a row of houses which have just
  collapsed down a steep slope in what is apparently the district known as
  Fourvière. Here two bearded men in the unmistakable uniform of the old Alpini
  are keeping order. We know as a matter of fact that the Lyons municipality at
  that time had three regiments of these soldiers quartered in barracks. They
  are wearing sandals supplemented by cloth strips that are twisted round their
  legs, and their cloaks are in good condition.</p>

  <p>Three others of these photographs give us a glimpse of the state of
  affairs in a disused silk factory. Up to the time of the economic collapse,
  the silk manufactured at Lyons was still largely that produced by the
  silkworm, but the supply of raw material seems to have died out more or less
  completely in the Rhône valley, and the shrinkage of trade and then the war
  diminished the importation of the reeled-up thread. But silk was needed in
  the manufacture of shells, and probably there were special efforts to
  maintain the supply up to the last. This particular establishment seems to
  have been carrying on a diminished output until the Lyons commune in 1951.
  Then no doubt it was abruptly abandoned. One photograph shows a great heap of
  paper litter among weaving-machines and a number of petrol cans. Apparently
  there was an attempt to fire the place. Another gives a vista of
  winding-machines shrouded in spiders' webs and fine dust. In a third a wild
  cat crouches among the spindles of a spinning-machine and spits at the
  unwanted intruder. The machinery has all the complicated clumsiness
  characteristic of twentieth-century mechanism. Apparently a window of some
  sort was opened or a blind drawn back to make this particular photograph, for
  the picture is blurred with a multitude of whirling moths, most of them out
  of focus, evidently just stirred up.</p>

  <p>These particular pictures are valuable because of their authenticity.
  There are also two contemporary dry-plate pictures of the Café Royal, the big
  restaurant of the Grand Hotel of Stockholm, deserted and still intact. They
  are oddly suggestive of two pictures of the ruins of the Baths of Caracalla
  in Rome as they appeared a hundred years earlier. And there is also a
  photograph of the remains of the old dining-room of the Hotel Métropole at
  Brighton in England before it was undermined and fell into the sea. But all
  the rest of the pictures given in Historical Scenes between 1955 and 1963 are
  arranged pictures. The Transport organization was running scores of
  aeroplanes and radio communications were restored long before the complex
  manufacture of photographic apparatus and material was set going again.</p>

  <p>There are some very interesting restorations of conditions in London
  showing the empty streets and the vacant tumbledown warehouses of the city
  after the pestilence. The pictures of the corridors of the hotels in the
  Strand turned into hospital wards are very impressive. So too is the sketch
  of a great fight between the cow-keepers and the potato-growers for the
  possession of Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens in which three hundred people
  were killed. The dreadful pictures of the bodies of plague victims floating
  down the Thames and accumulating in the Pool of London, however, are now said
  to be exaggerated.</p>

  <p>We try in the midst of our present securities to imagine the phases of
  anxiety, loss, incredulity and reluctant acquiescence through which the minds
  of hundreds of millions of Europeans passed, day by day, from the general
  comfort of the Twenties, through the shocks, fear, horror, rage and
  excitement of the war cycle, into this phase of universal impotence and
  destitution. The poor perhaps had a less vivid apprehension of disaster than
  the rich. Even in the days of General Prosperity, as it is called, they had
  at the best what we should consider very dull, drab, irksome lives. Even
  though they mostly ate sufficiently, they ate badly, and there was never a
  stage of universal decent housing at any time for them. They went from bad to
  worse. They passed from toil to unemployment and lethargy. But the middling
  sort passed from good to bad, from something one might almost consider
  tolerable living to the hopeless neediness of the masses.</p>

  <p>A class that went through great unhappiness everywhere during this period
  was the class of elderly and "retired" persons and persons of "independent
  means" (and no responsibilities) which had expanded so enormously during the
  First Age of General Prosperity. This superfluity of prosperous humanity had
  spread itself out very pleasantly over the world, oblivious of the exertions
  that sustained social discipline and ensured its security. Insensibly it had
  taken the place of the old administrative and directive noblesse and country
  gentry. The investment system during its period of steady efficiency had
  relieved this social stratum of every bother. There were great areas of
  agreeable country, residential districts, given up to this "well-off"
  society, to its gardens, which were often delightful, its golf-courses,
  race-courses, mountain sport centres, parks, country clubs, plages, and
  hotels. It wilted a little during the World War, but revived again very
  hopefully in the decade of hectic and uncertain expansion that followed.
  Then, as the Great Slump developed its grim phases, this life of leisure
  passed away.</p>

  <p>The Phase of Economy is really a misnomer. There was really no economy;
  there was strangulation and inaction through a cessation of expenditure.
  Nobody&mdash; unless it was a dexterous speculator on a falling
  market&mdash;grew richer, or even relatively richer. The only profits
  appeared in bank balance sheets. As the malady of arrest spread, traffics
  declined, enterprise died out, borrowing states and corporations suspended
  payments, and these children of good fortune, these well-off people, found
  themselves confronted at the same time by a suspension of payments and more
  and more urgent charitable appeals. Their bankers and solicitors informed
  them that first this trusted prop and then that was in arrears or in default.
  The waters of repudiation rose, submerging security after security. If they
  sold out and hoarded, some fluctuation in exchange might still engulf great
  fractions of their capital. "Whatever else may be falling off, sleepless
  nights are on the increase," a financial paper remarked in 1933. The head
  full of self-reproach that tossed on the crumpled pillow in the villa marked
  time with the fretting of the unemployed who worried in the stuffy cold of
  the slum.</p>

  <p>We have the Diary of Titus Cobbett, who rode on a bicycle from Rome and
  along the Riviera to Bordeaux in 1958. He had begun life as an art dealer,
  and had served the British Inland Revenue for some years as a valuer of
  furniture, pictures and the like. His tour seems to have been a journey of
  curiosity. He complains bitterly of the difficulty of changing money between
  Genoa and Bordeaux. He seems to have had some obscure diplomatic or consular
  function, but of that he is too discreet to speak. Perhaps he was sent to
  make a report, but if so there is no record of his instructions.</p>

  <p>His description of that smitten coast is still very interesting reading.
  He had, as a young man with good connections, known Monte Carlo well in the
  twenties, and the places he visited were often those at which he had stayed
  as a guest. He records the abandonment of hundreds of lovely châteaux,
  locked-up, unsaleable, abandoned, in the keeping perhaps of some old
  domestic, or frankly looted by the people of the district, once delightful
  gardens whose upkeep had become impossible, blind tangles of roses,
  oleanders, pomegranates, oranges, cypresses, palm trees, agaves, cacti and
  weeds; unremunerative hotels allowed to fall into ruins, broken-down
  water-conduits washing away the roads, bungalows taken over by the peasants.
  Something of the same swift desolation must have come upon the Campagna and
  the villadom of the Bay of Naples during the ebb of Roman vitality, but this
  had been a swifter decline. The roads, he says, were very variable, but a
  great number of the road signs and roadside advertisements were still making
  their mute appeal to a vanished traffic. As he rode along wondering whether
  he would find a reasonably clean and hospitable shelter for the night, he
  read, he says, picked out in metallic knobs that answered brightly to his oil
  lamp:</p>

  <p>H TEL S LEN ID </p>

  <p>CU SINE RENOM  </p>

  <p>T T LE  C NFOR   M   RNE </p>

  <p>Whither had host and guests departed? Where were the owners and tenants of
  these villas and gardens; the bright clientele of the pleasure resorts? Many
  of them no doubt were already dead, for the Riviera owners had been mostly
  middle-aged and oldish people. The rest were back in their own countries
  leading impoverished lives, full of tiresome reminiscences, lost in the
  universal indigence.</p>

  <p>Cobbett visited the ruins of the old Casino at Monte Carlo, and the
  younger Sports Club. The ceiling of the American Bar had fallen in a few days
  before his visit. "They looked small," he says. "When I was young they had
  seemed tremendous places."</p>

  <p>The celebrated garden in which suicidal gamblers used to put an end to
  their troubles was overgrown with mesembryanthemum.</p>

  <p>Yet there was one exception to this general decadence, and our observer
  stresses the significance of that. Air traffic was still going on. Between
  Rome and Marseilles he notes very precisely that he saw thirteen aeroplanes
  going east or west, besides two that he heard before he got up in the
  morning. "I doubt if I should have seen so many twenty-five years ago," he
  writes, and goes on to enlarge, very illuminatingly, on the revival of trade
  and the possible revival of order these throbbing mechanisms portended. At
  Nice and at Marseilles he noted there was shipping&mdash;"not mere fishing
  boats but ships of a thousand tons or more"; and at Nice they were building a
  bigger ship&mdash;he estimated it as a three-thousand tonner. We have no
  other records of shipbuilding between 1947 and 1962. Long before 1940 the
  building of very big ships had ceased to be a "paying proposition" and it is
  fairly certain that no sea-going ships whatever, big or little, were built
  anywhere in the world in the early fifties. Year by year the transport system
  of the bankrupt planet had been sinking into disuse. It is only nowadays that
  our historical students are attempting to work out statistical charts of that
  swift decadence.</p>

  <p>Cobbett also notes with surprise and hope a stretch of railway (operated
  by lever trolleys and a petrol engine or so) between the port of Marseilles
  and some inland quarries. He was clearly under the impression that no
  railways were operating in the world any longer. So soon as the traffic had
  sunken to a level below the possibility of paying subsistence wages,
  maintaining the permanent way and meeting running expenses, it had been
  impossible even for speculative buyers to handle these once valuable
  properties. They had become old junk on the landscape, tracks of torn and
  rusty rails smothered in agaves and wild flowers. He mentions the beauty of
  the viaducts of the old Sud de France, and tells how he bicycled along the
  footworn side-path of the Paris-Lyon-Méditerranée in preference to the road.
  The peasants had used the derelict railway as a convenient iron-mine, and few
  rails remained. Most of the sleepers had been used for fuel.</p>

  <p>At Fréjus there was an aerodrome, and here he describes a very
  illuminating conversation with a Spanish-American aviator who had served
  first with the Poles, then with the Germans, and finally with the French
  during the warfare. Cobbett was impressed by the evident revival of trade,
  and surprised to find rubber, spices, mercury and block-tin among the
  commodities coming by air from the East, while clocks, watches, compasses,
  knives, needles, buttons, hardened glass and the like were going back in
  exchange. Most of the trade was barter, and the profits were so considerable
  that there seemed every reason to expect a steady expansion of the
  service.</p>

  <p>He seems to have learnt for the first time of the developing combination
  of air-merchants who were mostly aviators surviving from the war. They had
  already organized a loose world union, it seems, and were keeping the airways
  and air lights in order.</p>

  <p>Cobbett remarked on the shipping revival he had noted.</p>

  <p>"We shall have to watch that," said the aviator significantly.</p>

  <p>"You take passengers?"</p>

  <p>"When they can pay a passage."</p>

  <p>"But this is civilization coming back!" cried Cobbett.</p>

  <p>"Don't believe it! It's a new civilization beginning."</p>

  <p>And he seems to have opened Cobbett's eyes for the first time to some of
  the ideas that were already taking shape in such brains as his. "World
  Empire?" he said. "That's an old idea! The men who hold the air and the
  transport hold the world. What do we want with empires and that stuff any
  more?"</p>

  <p>Cobbett was greatly impressed by this conversation. He went on across
  France to Bordeaux, where it seems some sort of money awaited him, thinking
  this over and jotting down his thoughts. He makes one sound and interesting
  parallel between this new World Transport Organization and those Hansa
  Merchants who played such an important rôle in the revival of civilization
  about the Baltic and North Europe generally after the Roman collapse. "After
  all," reflects Cobbett, "we have never given organized transport and trading
  its proper importance in history."</p>

  <p>At Bordeaux he sold his bicycle and was able to get a passage in an
  aeroplane to Le Bourget (an aerodrome of old origin near the ruins of Paris)
  and thence to fly to Hendon. His 'plane landed at Le Mans for an exchange of
  goods. His delight to escape from the rough roads he had been riding is
  infectious.</p>

  <p>He describes the recovery of the devastated French forests in the form of
  scrub, and he peered down at the little peasants' clearings that were
  appearing in groups and patches round the old towns. He sees the aviators and
  mechanics at the aerodromes with new eyes, and he learns from them of the way
  in which World Transport was picking up and reinstating metallurgical and
  electrical works. He has an eye for the beauty of Le Mans cathedral, which he
  had seen and admired in his student days, and which he rejoices to find
  intact, and he describes that early monument to the pioneers of aviation in
  the Place below which still survives. Amiens cathedral also was uninjured at
  that time.</p>

  <p>His diary ends on a melancholy note. Apparently he had not visited England
  for some years, and he is shocked by the ruinous desolation of the outer
  suburbs of London. Plainly he had lived in and loved London as a boy. A part
  of Hyde Park, in spite of the opposition of the squatter cultivators, had
  been converted into an aerodrome, but he found the rebuilding of the central
  region haphazard and unpleasing. He objects to the crowding of heavy
  buildings, with their vast anti-aircraft carapaces of cement, at the centre,
  due to the decay of suburban traffic facilities. It looked, he says, like a
  cluster of "diseased" mushrooms. "When shall we English learn to plan?" he
  asks, and then with an odd prophetic gleam he doubts whether the northern
  slope of the Thames depression, so ill drained and so soft in its subsoil,
  can carry this lumpish mass of unsound new buildings to which the life of the
  old city was shrinking.</p>

  <p>Only ten years later his fears were to be justified. The bed of the Thames
  buckled up and the whole of the Strand, Fleet Street, Cornhill and, most
  regrettable of all, the beautiful St. Paul's Cathedral of Sir Christopher
  Wren, so familiar to us in the pictures and photographs of that age,
  collapsed in ruin and perished in flame. The reader who has pored over
  Historical Scenes in a Hundred Volumes,&mdash;and what child has
  not?&mdash;will remember the peculiar appearance of the old Waterloo Bridge,
  crumpled up to a pent-house shape, and the grotesque obliquity of the
  Egyptian obelisk, once known as Cleopatra's Needle, that venerable slab of
  hieroglyphics, cracked and splintered by air-raid shrapnel, which slanted
  incredibly for some years before it fell into the banked-up water of the
  Lambeth-Chelsea lake.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap2_12"
     name="chap2_12">12. &mdash; AMERICA IN LIQUIDATION</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The preceding sections have given a general view of the
  course of history in the Old World during the middle decades of the twentieth
  century. Even in Europe certain regions, as we have noted, stand rather aloof
  from the essential drama, following a line of development of their own, less
  tragic and intense than that of the leading Powers. Spain, for example, the
  new Spain that was born in 1931, has the rôle of an onlooker, an onlooker
  much preoccupied with his own affairs. Still more noticeable is the
  non-participation of both Latin- and English-speaking America in these
  passionate and violent happenings. They suffered parallel economic, political
  and social stresses, but within their own limits. After the financial storms
  of the Early Thirties, the shocks that came to them from the European
  troubles affected them less and less. They took up their particular aspect of
  the decline and fall of private capitalism and worked it out in their own
  way.</p>

  <p>Yet the fact they did share in that decline and fall brings out very
  clearly a fact that was sometimes disputed in the past: the immediate causes
  of the world collapse in the twentieth century were first monetary
  inadaptability, secondly the disorganization of society through increased
  productivity, and thirdly the great pestilence. War was not a direct cause.
  The everyday life of man is economic, not belligerent, and it was strangled
  by the creditor. Had the world been already one state in 1900, and had it
  still been an economy of private accumulation with a deflating currency, it
  would have collapsed in very much the same fashion that it did collapse. Had
  it been cut up into a hundred belligerent states at that time, but with a
  monetary system that restrained the creditor and allowed industrial
  development without limit, it might have released sufficient energy to have
  gone on with its wars for another century or so before it reached the goal of
  mutual extermination. The monetary collapse was the most immediate factor in
  the world's disorganization, enfeeblement and famine. Without it man might
  have pursued a far longer and more strenuous career to massacre and
  suffocation. On the whole it was perhaps well for him that progress tumbled
  over finance in the nineteen-thirties.</p>

  <p>The futility of all the early anti-war movements becomes understandable
  only when we grasp the essential importance of a sane monetary nexus. On this
  we have insisted throughout, we have elucidated the connexion of the creditor
  and traditional antagonisms from half a dozen angles, and nothing could
  emphasize and drive home the lesson more than the parallelism of the American
  and Old-World experiences.</p>

  <p>From the days of their first political separation from the European system
  the American communities had gone through their own series of developmental
  phases, independent of and out of rhythm with the course of events in the
  Old-World. Independent&mdash;and yet not completely independent, because they
  were upon the same planet. Throughout the nineteenth century the American
  mind, in north and south alike, was saturated with the idea of ISOLATION. It
  was taught in the schools, in the Press, in every political utterance of a
  general import, that the New World was indeed a new world, an escape from the
  tyranny of ancient traditions to peace, liberty, opportunity and a fresh life
  for mankind. It had to avoid all "entangling alliances" with Old-World states
  and policies, forget the inveterate quarrels and hatreds of Europe even at
  the price of forgetting kinship and breaking with a common culture, and work
  out and set the example of a more generous way of living. From the days of
  George Washington to the days of Woodrow Wilson, in spite of the Civil War
  and much grave economic trouble, the American mind never abandoned its belief
  in its own exemplary quality and its conception that towards the rest of the
  world its attitude must be missionary and philanthropic. It realized that it
  knew many things very simply, but it had no doubt it knew better.</p>

  <p>Throughout the nineteenth century both America and Europe expanded
  enormously, economically, biologically. America was profoundly impressed by
  her own growth and disposed to disregard the equal pace of European progress.
  Assisted by a tremendous immigration from Europe, the population of the
  United States increased by about 80 millions in a hundred years. But in spite
  of that tremendous emigration, Europe during that period added 240 millions
  to her multitudes. The American cherished a delusion that he had "got on"
  relatively to Europe. His life had in fact expanded, concurrently with the
  European's, and through the working of ideas and inventions and the
  importation of human energy from the older centres. In his unimpeded
  continent the different elements in the expansion increased at rates that did
  not correspond with the European process. He was living in a similar
  progressive system, but he was more and more out of phase with Transatlantic
  developments.</p>

  <p>And throughout that century inventions in transport and communications
  were "abolishing distance" and bringing points that had formerly been months
  apart into a few hours' or a few moments' distance from one another.</p>

  <p>The resulting alternations of intimacy and remoteness across the Atlantic
  constitute one of the outstanding aspects of twentieth-century history. It is
  like two great and growing tops that spin side by side. They approach, they
  touch and clash, they wabble and fly apart. Or it is like two complexes of
  machinery, destined ultimately to combine into one world mechanism, whose
  spinning wheels attempt to mesh and fail to mesh and jar with a great shower
  of sparks and splinters and separate again. From the end of the nineteenth
  century onward the unifying forces of life were tending to gear America with
  Europe. By the middle of the twentieth century any observer might have been
  forgiven the conclusion that the intergearing had failed.</p>

  <p>We have already given great prominence in this history to the figures of
  Henry Ford, Woodrow Wilson, and the second Roosevelt, Franklin Roosevelt. We
  have told of the magnificent advance upon Europe and the subsequent recoil of
  America within and about them. A brief but competent contemporary book by an
  American publicist, Frank H. Simonds, Can America stay at Home? (1933)
  surveys the question of isolation very illuminatingly as it appeared in the
  opening years of the great economic slump which closed down for good and all
  the wild freedoms of Acquisitive Private Capitalism. He shows how the phases
  of approach and repulsion succeeded one another from the first imperialist
  enterprises of Roosevelt I (Theodore Roosevelt, 1901-1909) onward; how
  impossible it seemed for America either to keep out of Old-World affairs or
  to mingle frankly in them. It expressed its virtuous opinions and would not
  back them. It insisted upon moral judgments and would not take
  responsibility. In European eyes, to quote Simonds' new historical phrase,
  "American concern for peace appeared a transparent endeavour to combine the
  mission of John the Baptist with the method of Pontius Pilate." The
  explanation lay in just that mixture of liberal modernity and naive crudity
  in the American intelligence on which we have laid stress.</p>

  <p>From its beginning the American republic was a break with history, a new
  thing, far newer, having regard to its period, than the Soviet Republic of
  Lenin, and from its beginning it was failing to go on with its newness,
  failing to develop and intensify its ideas. It evolved a body of higher
  schools and cultivated men to think itself out only after more than a century
  of independence; in the interim it left its mass education to underpaid
  teachers and repetitive women. It grew bodily, immensely, and for more than a
  century it lived on imported brain-food. The result was this rawness, this
  immense sense of its mission and this want of any subtlety or vigour in its
  conduct. Wilson's foolish preachments and arrangements, so foolish and yet so
  saturated with the wisdom of world peace, were perhaps the highest expression
  of the American mind of his time.</p>

  <p>The American mind even in the nineteenth century was not an ignorant mind;
  it was an immensely uneducated mind. If it was clumsy, it was also free. Its
  religious "revivalism" was exactly parallel to its political fluctuations. We
  find in the stories and studies of authentic American life such features as
  camp-meetings and organized emotional campaigns for repentance and
  conversion. We think of firelit scenes, of harsh preaching and lusty
  chanting. These waves of popular feeling, these gatherings, often in the
  woods, with their hymn-singing, their exhortation, their shouts of penitence
  and exultant belief, the mindless exaltation and the subsequent mindless
  deflation of American spiritual life, were precisely reflected in these booms
  and slumps of the American world mission. Only with the shock of world
  economic disaster did the real social and political thinking of America rise
  to its full vigour. The retreat of the United States from the imbroglio of
  European affairs as the great depression intensified was marked by a new,
  more vigorous determination to grip the essentials of social life.</p>

  <p>And certainly there was everything to stimulate thought in the internal
  situation. The dégringolade was at first more rapid even than in Europe. The
  industrial edifice had been reared to giddier heights of mass production and
  fell more heavily. In 1928 the United States of America still believed itself
  the most prosperous country in the world; in 1933 its unemployed were more
  hopeless and formidable than those of any other continent. But they made no
  organized effort of revolt; they had no revolutionary formula to bring them
  together. They revolted as individuals and gangs and became criminals.
  Society was not overthrown, but it crumbled rapidly to dust and disorder. The
  crime wave, the financial stress, the frantic efforts to economize, and all
  the consequent strangulation of popular education and the dissolution of
  confidence, order and intercommunication&mdash;that sequence which we have
  already traced in general terms manifested itself most severely and typically
  in this vast, comparatively unhistorical area. Roosevelt II struggled
  gallantly but he came too late to stop the rot.</p>

  <p>In America as in Europe a phase of fragmentation set in. It was not a
  smash to which one can give a definite date, but every day there was
  something happening in the direction of dissolution. In America as in Europe
  State governments became insolvent phantoms making feebler and feebler
  efforts to collect taxes, and the Federal authority in Washington faded away,
  if not as completely as the League of Nations in Europe, at any rate in a
  comparable manner. We have the same phenomena of municipalities becoming
  autonomous, and provisional controls, Citizens' Unions, Law and Order
  Societies, Workers' Protection Associations and plain Workers' Soviets (in
  New Mexico and Arizona) springing into activity here, there and everywhere.
  In the Blue Mountains and on the Pacific coast small republics had already
  isolated themselves in 1945 and were carrying out a strange blend of
  Methodism, "Technocracy" and the Douglas Plan, and Utah had become a
  practically autonomous Single-Tax State and had restored Mormonism of the
  original type as the State religion. But there had been no formal secession
  from the Federal Union anywhere.</p>

  <p>There is in the Records a description of Washington in the year 1958, by a
  former attaché of the British Embassy there. (All the Ambassadors of the
  British Empire had been replaced by "consolidated consuls" in 1946.) He
  describes a visit to the White House, where he was entertained at lunch by
  President Benito Caruso. The President was carrying on although his term had
  expired because his successor elect had disappeared on his way to the capital
  in the Allegheny Mountains. There had been considerable confusion about the
  last election, and two Secession Presidents who were disputing possession of
  the State of New York after a conflict over the Yonkers Ballot Boxes had cut
  off communications with New England altogether.</p>

  <p>The President received his visitor very cordially and asked many very
  sympathetic and intelligent questions about the European situation. He spoke
  very hopefully of the American outlook. The "return to Normalcy", he said,
  was at last in sight. There had been a restoration of the steamboat traffic
  on the Mississippi, and cotton was going through to the north again in spite
  of the political unrest. A hundred and forty automobiles had been sent to
  South America alone in the year 1956-7 in the place of only seventy-two for
  the previous year. The new quinine-coffee barter system was working well. He
  looked forward now to a steady upward movement in business affairs. The
  Hoover Slump had, he admitted, lasted much longer and had gone much lower
  than had been expected, and it had tried the people to the utmost, but they
  had faced their trials in a manner worthy of the fathers of the republic. He
  concluded with the compliments usual then between the two great divisions of
  the English-speaking peoples.</p>

  <p>The lunch was plain but ample. There was excellent pork and a variety of
  vegetables which the President with genuine democratic frankness boasted he
  had raised himself with the help of his negro "secretariat" in the pig-pens
  and garden at the back of the White House. The duties of the secretariat seem
  to have been in the household rather than the office. They had been appointed
  for abstruse political reasons, and several of them were unable to read. Mrs.
  Caruso, a very pleasant lady of Irish extraction, was disposed to dwell on
  the difficulties of housekeeping in Washington in view of the increasing
  unpunctuality in the collection of the Federal revenue, but the President
  checked her, evidently considering these domestic matters a reflection upon
  the solvency of the nation.</p>

  <p>At that time only about a third of the States were actually represented by
  Congressmen in the Assembly. The rest had found it either too expensive or
  unnecessary to send delegates. A member was in possession of the house, a
  tattered individual, reciting some lengthy grievance; there were no reporters
  visible, and nobody was listening to him. Apparently this man was trying to
  "talk out" some legislative proposal, but the visitor could not find anyone
  who could explain the situation precisely.</p>

  <p>The visitor dined on the following day with the eloquent, vital and
  venerable Senator Borah from Idaho (1865-1970). He was in excellent form, and
  talked throughout the meal. Indeed, he talked so ably that his visitor was
  unable to ask him several questions previously prepared for him. He too was
  extremely hopeful for his country. He admitted that there had been a marked
  decline in the grosser welfare of America during his lifetime. He would not
  quarrel with statistics. In tons of coal and steel, in miles of railway run,
  in the mass production of motor-cars and commodities generally, it was
  possible to institute unfavourable comparisons with the past. "But man does
  not live by bread alone," said America's Grand Old Man. "Let us look a little
  nearer the heart of things."</p>

  <p>That heart, it seemed, had never been sounder. The pestilence, like
  everything that came from God, had been "wholesome". The standard of life
  was, he maintained, higher than it ever had been, having regard to the nobler
  aspects of things. Fewer bathrooms there might be, at least in working order,
  but there was far more purity of mind. In his younger days there had been a
  lamentable lapse into luxurious indulgence and carelessness on the part of
  the free people of the States, but all that was past. America was nearer now
  to the old Colonial simplicity, honesty and purity than she had ever
  been.</p>

  <p>A little inconsecutively the Senator went on to denounce the dishonesty of
  Europe and the disingenuousness of European and particularly of British
  diplomacy. He seemed for a time to be repeating long-remembered speeches and
  to have forgotten how completely British diplomacy had lapsed. He had
  apparently heard the word "attaché" before he began to talk, and that had
  sent his mind back to old times. He returned to the present situation. The
  United States, he insisted, had gone through far blacker phases in its early
  history. A hundred and fifty-four years ago Washington had been burnt by a
  victorious British army. Nothing of the sort had occurred during the present
  depression&mdash;if it could still be spoken of as a depression. Even at the
  darkest hour in this great Hoover Slump nobody had ever thought of burning
  Washington.</p>

  <p>Later on this same traveller visited the University of Chicago, Columbia
  University, Harvard and a number of other centres of intellectual activity.
  His comments are shrewd and intelligent, and fall in very conveniently with
  our examination of the mental reactions that even then were rapidly producing
  a new and more sinewy American consciousness amidst the ruins of its ancient
  laxity.</p>

  <p>These institutions were naturally in a most varied state of adjustment to
  the new conditions. Not all were progressive. Harvard reminded him of what he
  had read of the ancient lamaseries of Tibet. There was practically no paper
  to be got for note-taking or exercises, and the teaching was entirely oral
  and the learning done by heart. The libraries were closely guarded against
  depredations, and the more important books were only to be inspected in
  locked glass cases. A page was turned daily. The teachers varied in prestige
  with the number of their following. They either sat in class-rooms and under
  trees and lectured, or they went for long walks discoursing as they went to a
  rabble of disciples. They varied not only in prestige but physical
  well-being, because it was the rôle of these students to cultivate food for
  their masters and themselves in the college grounds and produce woven
  clothing and sandals in the Technical and Art Buildings. Some literary
  production was going on. The more gifted students wrote verses on slates and
  these, if they were sufficiently esteemed by the teaching staff, were written
  up on the walls or ceilings of the building. The atmosphere was one of
  archaic simplicity and studied leisure. The visitor was entertained by
  President Eliot, a tall distinguished-looking elderly man in a toga, who had
  inherited his position from his grandfather. There was a large open fire in
  the room, which was lit by tallow candles which two undergraduates
  continually snuffed. The President talked very beautifully over his simple
  soup, his choice Maryland claret and a cornucopia of fruit and nuts, and the
  conversation went on until a late hour.</p>

  <p>The impression of Nicholson, the visitor, was one of an elegant
  impracticability. The simple graciousness of the life he could not deny, but
  it seemed to him also profoundly futile. He seems, however, to have concealed
  this opinion from the President and allowed him to talk unchallenged of how
  Harvard had achieved the ultimate purification and refinement of the Anglican
  culture, that blend of classicism and refined Christianity, with a graceful
  monarchist devotion.</p>

  <p>"There is a King here?" asked the visitor.</p>

  <p>"Not actually a King," said the President regretfully. "We have decided
  that the Declaration of Independence is inoperative, but we have been unable
  to locate the legitimate King of England, and so there has been no personal
  confirmation of our attitude. But we have an attitude of loyalty. We cherish
  that."</p>

  <p>The chief subjects of study seem to have been the Ptolemaic cosmogony, the
  Homeric poems, the authentic plays of Shakespeare and theology. The scanty
  leisure of the students did not admit of a very high standard of gymnastics,
  and they seem to have abandoned those typical American college sports of
  baseball and football altogether. The President spoke of these games as "late
  innovations". One chief out-of-door employment seems to have been
  wood-cutting and felling.</p>

  <p>This glimpse of graceful and idealistic pedantry is interesting because it
  left so few traces for later times. It depended very much on the personality
  of the President himself, and after his death at an advanced age, and the
  hard winters of 1981 and 1983, this ancient foundation seems to have been
  completely deserted and allowed to fall into ruin.</p>

  <p>Both Columbia University and Chicago were in violent contrast to Harvard.
  Here the influence of the new De Windt school of thought was very evident,
  and the traditions of Dewey, Robinson, Harry Elmer Barnes, Raymond Fosdick,
  the Beard couple and their associates were still alive. Although New York
  City was already abandoned and dangerous because of the instability of its
  huge unoccupied skyscrapers, there was still considerable trading on the
  Hudson River and some manufacturing activity. The great iron bridges were
  still quite practicable for pack horses and mules, and, affording as they did
  a North and South line of communication of quite primary value, they gave the
  place a unique commercial importance. The industrial workers there and in
  Chicago were in close contact with the college staffs, and they were working
  with very great energy at what they called "The General Problem of
  Recovery".</p>

  <p>"They don't", writes Nicholson, "admit that civilization has broken down.
  They talk here just as they did in Washington, of the Hoover Slump. I never
  met people so confident that somehow and in some fashion things will pick up
  again. There is nothing like this at home. One night there was a tremendous
  crash and an earthquake. A huge pile called 'Radio City' had collapsed in the
  night. In the bright keen morning I went out to the Pantheon, and there a
  crowd of people was watching the clouds of dust that were still rising, and
  listening to the occasional concussions that marked minor fallings-in. Were
  they in the least downhearted? Not at all. 'There's a bit more liquidation,'
  said a man near me. 'We have to get these things off our hands somehow.'"</p>

  <p>Nicholson gives a fairly full account of the curricula of both Columbia
  and Chicago. He is greatly struck by the equipment of the scientific
  laboratories and the relative importance of experimental work. "I felt almost
  as though I was back in 1930," he says, "when I visited the Rockefeller
  chemical laboratory." But still more was he struck by the advanced state of
  the sociological work. "They are producing a sort of lawyers who are not
  litigators," he writes. "I think the new law stuff they are doing here is the
  most interesting thing about the place. It isn't what my father would have
  recognized as law at all. It's the physiology and pathology of society and
  social therapeutics arising therefrom. There are one or two men here, Hooper
  Hamilton and Rin Kay for instance, whose talk is a liberal education. They
  won't hear any of the rot we deal out at home about the Sunset of
  Mankind."</p>

  <p>That was his key observation, so to speak. But it is interesting to note
  that the reduction of Basic English to practicable use was also being made.
  Spanish and English were already on their way to become the interchangeable
  languages they remained throughout all the earlier twenty-first century. The
  teaching of French had fallen off very greatly, and the old classical studies
  (Greek and Latin) to judge by his complete silence about them, had been
  completely abandoned.</p>

  <p>Our tourist flew from Chicago to the Ford Aerodrome at Dearborn, saw the
  ruins of the main factories and the reconstructed settlement, and spent some
  days with the Technological School there and in the still very imperfectly
  arranged Museum of American Life. It was startling to see some scores of
  square miles of closely cultivated land round the open space of the Aerodrome
  and to learn that an old Ford idea of dividing the time of the staff between
  agricultural production and mechanical work was still in effective operation.
  There were associated textile and boot factories in Detroit. There was still
  an output of some thousand-odd automobiles a year and a "few hundred" (!)
  aeroplanes. And there was a small but healthy radio department.</p>

  <p>"We keep in touch," said the Director. "We don't interfere with people,
  and we are not interfered with. We are running all that is left of the
  distance letter post.... Yes, Canada and Mexico as well. Nobody bothers us
  now about the boundaries, and we don't bother. When trade was at its worst we
  sat tight, cultivated our farms, and did experiments."</p>

  <p>The Henry Ford, that "great original" whose adventure of the Peace Ship
  has been chosen to mark a turning-point in our history, had long since played
  out his part, but the Director mentioned in these papers seems to have been
  his son Edsel, carrying on the initiatives of his finely simple-minded
  parent.</p>

  <p>That the place was able to "sit tight and carry on" was no empty boast.
  The visitor from a slovenly world dwells on the "tidiness" of everything. The
  Edison workshop was still in the original state as it had been re-erected by
  Henry Ford; there or in the Museum Nicholson was shown the first phonograph
  and the first telephone ever made, and the earliest experimental automobiles
  and aeroplanes.</p>

  <p>"It is as recent as that," he tells us he said. "In the lifetime of
  ourselves and our fathers we have seen the beginning, the triumph, and the
  collapse of the greatest civilization that the world has ever seen. We have
  spanned the whole history of mechanical mass production."</p>

  <p>"Not a bit of it," said the Director. "It's hardly begun."</p>

  <p>There followed a long conversation the gist of which the visitor seems to
  have written down immediately in dialogue form. Its interest for the student
  of history lies in the fact that here again we have evidence of the way in
  which amidst the world-wide collapse into misery, disorder and incoherent
  peasant life the vitality of the mechanical transport system was manifesting
  itself. We can put the talk of the Dearborn director side by side with that
  of the European aviator reported by Titus Cobbett. There is the same
  realization of the final death of the old order. "All that king business and
  congress business is as dead as mutton," said the Dearborn director. "And the
  banking business is deader."</p>

  <p>"And what is coming?" asked the visitor.</p>

  <p>"THAT," said the director, and pointed to a mounting aeroplane inaudible
  and almost invisible in the blue.</p><br>

  THE WORLD RENASCENCE:<br>
  THE BIRTH OF THE MODERN STATE</a></h2>

  <h2><a id="chap3_01"
     name="chap3_01">1. &mdash; THE PLAN OF THE MODERN STATE IS WORKED
     OUT</a></h2>

  <p class="first">In the preceding chapters the culmination, the dislocation
  and the collapse of the private capitalist civilization has been told. It has
  been a chronicle of disaster, wherein particular miseries, the torment and
  frustration of thousands of millions, are more than overshadowed by its
  appalling general aimlessness. We have seen the urge towards unity and order,
  appearing and being frustrated, reappearing and again being defeated. At last
  it reappeared&mdash;and won. The problem had been solved.</p>

  <p>The world was not able to unify before 1950 for a very simple reason:
  there was no comprehensive plan upon which it could unify; it was able to
  unify within another half century because by that time the entire problem had
  been stated, the conditions of its solution were known and a social class
  directly interested in the matter had differentiated out to achieve it. From
  a vague aspiration the Modern World-State became a definite and so a
  realizable plan.</p>

  <p>It was no great moral impulse turned mankind from its drift towards chaos.
  It was an intellectual recovery. Essentially what happened was this: social
  and political science overtook the march of catastrophe.</p>

  <p>Obscure but persistent workers in these decades of disaster pieced
  together the puzzle bit by bit. There is a fantastic disproportion between
  the scale of the labourers and the immense consequences they released. The
  psychology of association, group psychology, was a side of social biology
  that had been disregarded almost entirely before the time of which we are
  writing. People had still only the vaguest ideas about the origins and
  working processes of the social structure in and by which they lived. They
  accepted the most arbitrary and simple explanations of their accumulated net
  of relationships, and were oblivious even to fundamental changes in that net.
  Wild hopes, delusions and catastrophes ensued inevitably.</p>

  <p>If you had interrogated an ordinary European of the year 1925 about the
  motives for his political activities and associations and his general social
  behaviour, he would probably have betrayed a feeling that your enquiry was
  slightly indelicate, and if you overcame that objection, he would have talked
  either some nonsense about the family as the nucleus of social organization,
  a sort of expansion of brothers and cousins, kith and kin to the monarch, the
  Sire of the whole system, or he would have gone off in an entirely different
  direction and treated you to a crude version of Rousseau's Social Contract in
  which he and the other fellows had combined under agreed-upon rules for
  mutual defence and aid. The betting would have been quite even as to which of
  these flatly contradictory explanations he would have given.</p>

  <p>He would have said nothing about religious ties in 1925, though fifty
  years earlier he might have based his whole description on the Divine Will.
  He would have betrayed no lucid apprehension of the part played by the money
  nexus in gearing relationships; he would have been as unconscious as his
  Roman predecessor of the primary social importance of properly adjusted
  money. He would have thought it was just stuff you earnt and handed out and
  got things for, and he might have added rather irrelevantly that it was "the
  root of all evil". He would certainly have referred to the family idea when
  his patriotism was touched upon, if not before, to justify that tangle of
  hates, fears and consequent and subordinate loyalties; he would have talked
  of "mother country" or "fatherland". If he practised any craft or skill, he
  might or might not have had his mind organized in relation to his profession
  or trade union, but there would be no measure between that and his
  patriotism, either might override the other, and either might give way before
  some superstitious or sexual complex in his make-up.</p>

  <p>Incidentally he would have revealed extensive envy systems and social
  suspicion and distrust systems, growing up at every weak point like casual
  fungi. Everything would be flavoured more or less with the chronic hatred
  endemic everywhere. And all these disconnected associations from which flowed
  his judgments and impulses he would have regarded as natural&mdash;as natural
  as the shape of his ears; he would have been blankly unconscious that the
  education of school and circumstances had had anything to do with his
  accumulation.</p>

  <p>On millions of minds equipped in this fragmentary fashion, uninformed or
  misinformed and with no internal connectedness, the institutions of the world
  were floating right up to the middle of the Twentieth Century. Tossing at
  last, rather than merely floating. Men called themselves individualist or
  socialist, and they had not the beginnings of an idea how the individual was
  and might be related to society; they were nationalist and patriotic, and
  none of them could tell what a nation was. It was only when these
  institutions began to batter against each other, and leak and heel over, and
  show every disposition to go down altogether, that even intelligent men began
  to realize how haphazard, sentimental and insincere were their answers to the
  all-important question: "What holds us together and sustains our
  cooperations?"</p>

  <p>This prevalent superficiality and ignorance about socializing forces was
  the necessary reflection of a backwardness and want of vigour in academic
  circles and the intellectual world. The common man, busied about his petty
  concerns, did not know nor think about collective affairs because at the time
  there existed no knowledge or ordered thought in an assimilable form to reach
  down and stimulate his mind. The social body was mentally embryonic from the
  top downward. That it was possible to demonstrate a complete system of social
  reactions and to state the necessary idea of the Modern State in convincing
  and practically applicable terms, had still to penetrate to the minds not
  merely of the politicians and statesmen, but of the psychologists, historians
  and so-called "economists" of the time.</p>

  <p>In 1932 Group Psychology was at about the same level of development as was
  physical science in the days of the Marquess of Worcester's Century of
  Inventions (1663). It was still in that vague inconclusive phase of "throwing
  out" ideas. It was no more capable of producing world order than the physical
  science of 1663 could have produced an aeroplane or a steam turbine. The
  ordinary man seeking guidance in the dismay of the Great Slump (see Emil
  Desaguliers' Ideas in Chaos and Society in Collapse, 2017) was confronted
  with a sort of intellectual rummage sale. He had believed that somewhere
  somebody knew; he discovered that nobody had ever yet bothered to know. A
  dozen eminent authorities with the utmost mutual civility were giving him
  every possible and impossible counsel in his difficulties, suavely but flatly
  contradicting each other. They were able to do so because they were all
  floating on independent arbitrary first assumptions without any structural
  reference to the primary facts of human ecology.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless certain primary matters were being rapidly analysed at that
  time. The general understanding of money, for example, was increasing
  rapidly. Desaguliers notes about a hundred and eighty names, including the
  too-little-honoured name of that choleric but interesting amateur, Major C.
  H. Douglas (Works in the Historical Documents, Economic Section B. 178200),
  who were engaged in clearing away the conception of a metallic standard as a
  monetary basis. They were making it plain that the only possible money for a
  progressive world must keep pace with the continually increasing real wealth
  of that world. They were getting this into the general consciousness as a
  matter of primary importance.</p>

  <p>But they were proposing the most diverse methods of realizing this
  conception. The "Douglas Plan" appealed to the general social credit, but was
  limited by the narrow political outlook of the worthy Major, who could
  imagine bankers abolished but not boundaries. In America an interesting
  movement known as "Technocracy" was attracting attention. Essentially that
  was a soundly scientific effort to restate economics on a purely physical
  basis. But it was exploited in a journalistic fashion and presented to a
  remarkably receptive public as a cut-and-dried scheme for a new social order
  in which social and economic life was to be treated as an energy system
  controlled by "experts". The explicit repudiation of democratic control by
  the Technologists at that date is very notable. The unit of energy was to be
  the basis of a new currency. So every power station became a mint and every
  waterfall a potential "gold-mine", and the money and the energy in human
  affairs remained practically in step. Another important school, represented
  by such economists as Irving Fisher and J. M. Keynes, was winning an
  increased adherence to the idea of a price index controlling the issue of
  currency.</p>

  <p>It was a phase of disconnected mental fermentation. Many of those who were
  most lucid about monetary processes were, like Douglas and Keynes, still in
  blinkers about national and imperial boundaries; they wanted to shut off some
  existing political system by all sorts of artificial barriers and restraints
  from the world at large, in order to develop their peculiar system within its
  confines. They disregarded the increasing flimsiness of the traditional
  political structure altogether. They were in too much of a hurry with their
  particular panacea to trouble about that. And if the money reformers were not
  as a rule cosmopolitans, the cosmopolitans were equally impatient with the
  money reformers and blind to the primary importance of money.</p>

  <p>A third class of intelligences stressed the urgent necessity for great
  public enterprises to correct the paradoxical increase of unemployment
  consequent upon the increase of productivity that had taken the shiftless
  world by surprise. That was an independent maladjustment. But thinkers of
  this school were apt to disregard the importance of monetary rectification.
  As to who was to control the more complicated methods of mutual service
  proposed, the world money and the world socialism and so forth, there was an
  even greater diversity of outlook and an even greater conflict of mental
  limitations. As Desaguliers says in his summary: "People could not get out of
  the sinking social vessels in which they found themselves for the simple
  reason that nothing but the imperfectly assembled phantom of a salvage ship
  was yet in sight, a large rudderless, powerless promise, so to speak,
  standing by."</p>

  <p>Only very knowledgeable people could have foretold then how nearly this
  phase of throwing out bright but disconnected ideas was drawing to its end,
  and how rapidly the consolidation of social and educational science into an
  applicable form was to go forward, once that it had begun. The rush of
  correlated social discoveries and inventions to the rescue of mankind, when
  at last it was fairly started, was even more rapid and remarkable than the
  release of steam and electrical energy in the nineteenth century.</p>

  <p>It went on under difficulties. Perhaps it was quickened and purified by
  those very difficulties.</p>

  <p>Gustave De Windt's great work, Social Nucleation (1942), was the first
  exhaustive study of the psychological laws underlying team play and esprit de
  corps, disciplines of criminal gangs, spirit of factory groups, crews,
  regiments, political parties, churches, professionalisms, aristocracies,
  patriotisms, class consciousness, organized research and constructive
  cooperation generally. It did for the first time correlate effectively the
  increasing understanding of individual psychology, with new educational
  methods and new concepts of political life. In spite of its unattractive
  title and a certain wearisomeness in the exposition, his book became a
  definite backbone for the constructive effort of the new time.</p>

  <p>De Windt worked under all the handicap of the intellectual worker in that
  uncomfortable time. Much of his writing, like that of Marx and Lenin, was
  done in the British Museum in London, but he was expelled from England during
  a phase of xenophobia in 1939, and he was not allowed to return from Holland
  to his "beloved Bloomsbury" until 1941. He was slightly gassed during the
  ninth Polish air raid on Berlin, and this no doubt accelerated his death in
  Bloomsbury, the tuberculous London slum in which his book was completed.</p>

  <p>Much has been done since to elaborate and correct the broad
  generalizations he established. But his name stands with those of Plato,
  Galileo, Newton, Darwin and Robert Owen as marking a real step forward in the
  expression and expansion of human ideas. Such men are all in their various
  dimensions something more than themselves, like stones that have become
  surveyors' datum marks. After 1950 De Windt's doctrines and formulae spread
  with great rapidity, in spite of the disturbed state of the
  world&mdash;assisted and enforced indeed by the disturbed state of the
  world.</p>

  <p>Few people read De Windt nowadays, just as few people read Plato or Bacon
  or Charles Darwin or Adam Smith or Karl Marx, but what he thought has been
  built into the general outlook of mankind. What he established is now
  platitude, but in his time very much of what he had to say would still have
  seemed heresy and fantasy, if it had not been for the patient massiveness,
  the Darwinesque patience, with which he built up his points.</p>

  <p>The most important features of his teaching were, first, that he insisted
  with an irrefutable rigidity upon the entirely artificial nature of the
  content of the social side of a human being. Men are born but citizens are
  made. A child takes to itself what is brought to it. It accepts example,
  usage, tradition and general ideas. All the forms of its social reactions and
  most of its emotional interpretations are provided by its education.</p>

  <p>"Obviously," the reader will say. But it is essential to the understanding
  of history to realize that before De Windt's time this was not obvious. Moral
  values, bias and prejudice, hatreds and so forth were supposed to come "by
  nature." And consequently the generation about him had grown up in a clotted
  mass of outworn explanations, metaphors, mythologies and misleading
  incentives, and the misshapen minds reflected and condoned the misshapen
  social order. His rôle in intellectual history is primarily that of a strong
  arm sweeping a terrible litter of encumbrance aside, and replacing it by a
  clearly defined structure. He restored again to credibility what Plato had
  first asserted: that, however difficult, it was possible to begin again at
  the beginning with uninfected minds. And having cleared his ground in this
  way he proceeded to build up the imperatives of that sane progressive
  education and life for mankind which now opens out about us.</p>

  <p>He brought home clearly to the general intelligence firstly that the
  monetary method of relationship was essential to any complex productive
  society, since it was the only device that could give personal choice and
  freedom in return for service. It liberated economic relationships. But money
  was not a thing in itself, it was a means to an end, and its treatment was to
  be judged entirely by its attainment of that end. It had indeed grown out of
  a barterable commodity, a thing in itself, silver or gold or the like, but it
  had ceased to be this, and it was the difficulties in the transition of money
  from the former to the latter status that had released those diseases of the
  economic system which had in succession first destroyed the Roman imperialism
  and then the European sovereign states. A completely abstract money, a money
  as abstract and free from association with any material substance as weight
  or measure, had to be contrived for mankind. Human society could not be saved
  from chaos without it. It had to be of worldwide validity; its tokens and
  notes had to be issued to maintain a practically invariable price index, and
  it had to be protected by the most stringent laws against any form of
  profit-making manipulation. He demonstrated that not merely forgery, but
  every form of gambling and speculation, had to be made major offences under a
  criminal code. He showed that usury was unnecessary. He unravelled the old
  entanglements by which new production had hitherto been saddled with
  permanent debts for its promotion and experiments. He made profit-making
  banking, that Old Man of the Sea, get off the back of enterprise. He
  eliminated every excuse for its profits. Banking was a public function. The
  distribution of credit was a vital part of government.</p>

  <p>The New Banking of the Twenty-first Century grew up along the lines he
  established for it. To-day it is our system of public book-keeping, a part of
  our state statistical organization, a clearing-house of obligations and a
  monetary record of the accumulating surplus of racial energy, which the
  world-controls apportion to our ever expanding enterprises. It is entirely
  public and entirely gratuitous. It is hard to realize that it was ever
  allowed to be a source of private and secret profit. We register a man's
  earnings and spending as we register births and deaths. Our money is
  fundamentally a check on these publicly kept private accounts.</p>

  <p>But this desiratum of a sufficiency of invariable money was only a
  "foundation need," a quantitative basis for the establishment of vital
  relationships, or, in De Windt's terminology, for "social nucleation." So
  soon as money was put in order it ceased to be necessary to trouble about
  money, just as it is needless to think about light and air in a properly lit
  and ventilated room.</p>

  <p>For a couple of centuries before De Windt, the family, which had been the
  common social cellule throughout the whole agricultural age of mankind, had
  been losing its distinctness, had been dissolving into larger systems of
  relationship, more especially in the Northern and Western communities. It had
  been losing its economic, its mental, and its emotional autonomy at the same
  time. In the nineteenth century this dissolution of the family had gone on
  very rapidly indeed. The domestication of women, and their concentration upon
  children and the home, had diminished greatly.</p>

  <p>By general sentiment, the instinctive factor in family unification had
  always been overrated. In effect, that instinctive bond dissolves long before
  the children are thirteen or fourteen. After that age the binding force of
  parent to child and vice versa is not instinct, but affection, convenience,
  habit, and tradition. And that convenience, usage, and tradition had
  dwindled. Put to the test of exterior attractions, family solidarity had
  weakened not only in the West, but also, as Asia had been Westernized, in
  Turkey, India, China, and Japan. This was so essentially, even more than
  apparently. The family home remained generally as a meeting-place and common
  domicile for parents and children, but it ceased to be a vehicle of
  tradition, it ceased to train and discipline. It ceased to do so for the
  simple reason that these functions were now discharged with far more
  emphasis, if with less intensity, by exterior agencies. Citizens were
  begotten in the home but they were no longer MADE in the home.</p>

  <p>De Windt drew a vivid contrast between the home life of a Central European
  family in the late eighteenth century, with the father reading the Bible to
  his assembled offspring, conducting daily prayer, watching over, reproving
  and chastizing his sons and daughters up to the age of sixteen or seventeen
  and even controlling their marriage, and the loosely associated family
  structure in the early twentieth century.</p>

  <p>This structural dissolution was universally recognized long before the
  time of De Windt, but it was left for him to emphasize the need for a planned
  "renucleation" in the social magma that arose out of this dissolution. The
  popular school, the experiences and associations of industrialized
  production, the daily paper and so forth, had knocked the strength out of the
  mental and moral education of the home and put nothing in its place. The
  sapping forces had not, in their turn, been converted into "organic forces."
  In default of these, minds were lapsing towards crude and base self-seeking
  and entirely individualistic aims.</p>

  <p>These contemporary emotional suggestions and haphazard ideologies were not
  good enough, he preached, to make a human being a tolerable social unit.
  Social tissue was not to be made and coordinated on such lines. The stars in
  their courses were pointing our race towards the organized world community,
  the Modern State, and if ever that goal was to be attained, if the
  reorganization of the species was not to collapse, degenerate, and perish by
  the wayside, then the individual mind throughout the world had to be
  educated, had to be disciplined and equipped, definitely and sufficiently to
  this end. That would not come by nature. The social side of the individual
  had to be oriented deliberately. "Society is an educational product."</p>

  <p>For the race to get to this Modern State as a whole it had to get there as
  so many hundreds of millions of human beings, all individually aware of that
  as the general objective at which their lives aimed. The Modern State could
  not arrive as an empty form with all humanity left behind it. Every teacher,
  every writer, every talker, every two friends who talked together constituted
  a potential primary nucleus in a renascent social system. These nuclei had to
  be organized. Their existence had to be realized, and they had to be brought
  into effective cooperation. It is hard nowadays to realize that once upon a
  time such commonplaces as these were not commonplaces, and that in the very
  days when De Windt was writing, multitudes of well-meaning people were
  attempting to assemble "movements" for social reconstruction and world
  revolution out of the raw, unprepared miscellany of the contemporary crowd.
  It was with extreme reluctance that impatient reformers turned their minds
  from impossible coups d'état and pronunciamentos, strikes against war and
  booby millennia, to this necessary systematic preliminary renucleation of the
  world. The immediate task seemed too narrow and intense for them and its
  objective too high and remote. "It is no good asking people what they want,"
  wrote De Windt. "That is the error of democracy. You have first to think out
  what they ought to want if society is to be saved. Then you have to tell them
  what they want and see that they get it."</p>

  <p>And further, he urged, if you cannot start nucleation everywhere, then at
  least you can start it close at hand. "Get the nuclei going. Be yourself a
  nucleus." From the beginning of life, nuclei have begotten nuclei. The Modern
  State, which had to be evoked everywhere, could be begun anywhere.</p>

  <p>Another point that was new in his time, so far as Western civilization
  went, was his insistence upon the greater importance of adolescent education
  and his denial of the primary right of the parent to shape his offspring
  according to his fancy. The "renucleation" of society had to be complete. The
  "nuclei" which were ultimately to become the sole educational and
  disciplinary units of a new-born society would be in the first place, and
  usually, intensive study circles and associations for moral and physical
  training. Their social and political activities were to be secondary
  exercises, subordinated to a primary mental, moral and bodily training. He
  searched the social disorder about him for favourable conditions for the
  pioneer nucleations. He looked to factories, laboratories, technical schools,
  public services, hospital staffs, to banded men and women of all sorts, for
  the material for his nucleation. He insisted that the impulse to build up a
  social order was instinctive. Wherever there was social confusion the crude
  efforts to get together into a new directive order appeared.</p>

  <p>He pointed to the Sokols, Nazis, Fascists, Communist Party members,
  Kuomintang members of his time, as the first primitive intimations of the
  greater organization that was coming. They had the spirit of an élite class,
  although they wasted it more or less upon the loyalties and prejudices of the
  past. People are not leading these young men, he argued; "they are taking
  advantage of the instinctive needs of these young men. Try to realize what it
  is that they are&mdash;however blindly&mdash;seeking."</p>

  <p>Like St. Paul, the founder of Christianity, speaking to the
  Athenians&mdash;he quotes the passage&mdash;he said: "That Unknown God, whom
  ignorantly ye worship, him declare I unto you." He was declaring the as yet
  unknown Modern State.</p>

  <p>Intensively De Windt's teaching was a theory of education; extensively it
  was the assertion of the Modern State. These were inseparable aspects of the
  same thing. "A community is an education in action," he declared. And with a
  complete continuity he carried up his scheme of social structure through
  every variety of productive organization, control and enterprise. Men were to
  "fall in and serve this end."</p>

  <p>Borrowing a word from Ortega y Gasset, but going boldly beyond that
  original thinker, he declared that "plenitude" of life was now only to be
  attained by living in relation to the Modern State. All other living was
  "waste, discontent and sorrow." It was becoming impossible to retain self-
  respect, to be happy within oneself, unless one was "all in" upon that one
  sound objective. The old loyalties, to flag, to nation, to class, were
  outworn and discredited. They had become unreal. They did not call out all
  that was in a man, because now we saw their limitations. They could no longer
  keep up the "happy turgidity" of life. They could not be served "with a sure
  and untroubled soul". They would certainly leave a man in the end "deflated,
  collapsed into an aimless self". In the past men could live and live fully
  within their patriotisms and their business enterprises, because they knew no
  better. But now they knew better.</p>

  <p>Finally De Windt set himself diametrically against one of the direst
  concepts of Parliamentary Democracy, a concept that still had enormous
  influence in his time, and that was the idea of the "Opposition."
  "Criticize," he wrote, "yes, but do not obstruct." If a directive
  organization is fundamentally bad, he taught, break it and throw it away, but
  rid your minds altogether of a conception of see-saw and give and take as a
  proper method in human affairs. The Parliamentary gang Governments, that were
  then in their last stage of ineptitude, were rotten with the perpetual
  amendment and weakening of measures, with an endless blocking and barring of
  projects, with enfeebling bargains and blackmailing concessions. Against
  every directive body, every party in power, sat another devoting itself to
  misrepresenting, thwarting, delaying, and spoiling, often for no reason or
  for the flimsiest reasons, merely for the sake of misrepresenting, thwarting,
  delaying and spoiling what the governing body was attempting to do, in the
  hope of degrading affairs to such a pitch of futility as to provoke a change
  of government that would bring the opposition into power. The opportunities
  of profit and advancement afforded in such a mental atmosphere to a
  disingenuous careerist were endless.</p>

  <p>All this tangle of ideas had to be swept aside. "About most affairs there
  can be no two respectable and antagonistic opinions," said De Windt. "It is
  nonsense to pretend there can be. There is one sole right way and there are
  endless wrong ways of doing things. A government is trying to go the right
  way or it is criminal. Sabotage must cease. It has always been one of the
  ugliest vices of advanced movements. It is a fundamental social vice."</p>

  <p>His discussion of the difference between Criticism and Opposition is one
  of those classics that few people read. It is a pity, because it is a very
  good specimen of twentieth-century English prose. The right to criticize and
  the duty of well-wrought criticism are fundamental to modern citizenship. He
  considered how that right and duty had been ignored by the shallow mentality
  of Italian Fascism and how fatally they had been entangled with the
  suppression of malignancy in Russia. He analysed the reckless
  irresponsibility of censorship in the Western communities. There was no law
  anywhere to restrain conspiracies, on the part of religious, political, or
  business bodies, for the suppression of publications. His warnings against
  the suppression of opinion were not so immediately effective as his general
  revolutionary project. Many people did not realize what he was driving at. In
  practice the conflict of world order with the opposition spirit, during the
  struggle to maintain the Air Dictatorship, was to lapse again and again into
  the suppression of honest criticism. In practice it was found that criticism
  and suggestion passed by insensible degrees into incitement and
  insurrectionary propaganda.</p>

  <p>This clear-cut revolutionary scheme of De Windt's was vividly new and
  tonic to the energetic young men of the middle twentieth century. We
  summarize here its main constructive conceptions in spite of its present
  platitudinousness. It is unnecessary to tell in any detail his far-sighted
  schemes to link his nuclei into a world propaganda, because by insensible
  degrees that organization has grown into the educational system of our world
  to-day. This history and indeed every text book in use in the world could
  well be dedicated to him. And his complex and very detailed anticipations of
  the process of a world revolution need not detain us here (his Book V, The
  New World in the Body of the Old contains most of this), because we can now
  tell of that vast reconstruction itself.</p>

  <p>In some respects he was remarkably prescient, in others he estimated human
  reactions inaccurately and even incorrectly. The reconstruction of human
  affairs involved some very rough work from which he would have recoiled. None
  the less he put all the main structural factors in the establishment of the
  Modern State so plainly and convincingly before his fellow-men that soon
  thousands and presently millions were living for that vision, were bringing
  it out of thought into reality. He made it seem so like destiny, that it
  became destiny.</p>

  <p>For some years his views spread very slowly. An increasing number of
  people knew about them, but at first very few made serious efforts to realize
  them. One man after another would say, "But this is right!" and then "But
  this is impossible!" De Windt was dead before his school of thought became a
  power in the world. Like Karl Marx, he was never to know of the harvest he
  had sown.</p>

  <p>In our description of the failure of the League of Nations we have noted
  how foredoomed that experiment was, because nowhere among either the
  influential men of the time nor among the masses was there any sense of the
  necessity and the necessary form of a new world order. The statesmen,
  diplomatists and politicians of the time impress us as almost incredibly
  blind to things that are as plain as daylight to us now, and it is hard for
  us to believe that that blindness was not wilful. It was not. They could not
  see it. We read their speeches at conference after conference until their
  voices die away at last in the rising tide of disaster and we almost cry out
  as we read: "You idiots! Wasn't world control there just under your noses?
  And was anything else but disaster possible?"</p>

  <p>The answer is that it was not precisely under their noses. Slowly,
  laboriously, with perpetual repetitions and slight variations, the Obvious
  had to be got into and spread and diffused in the human mind. It is De
  Windt's peculiar claim to human gratitude, not that he discovered anything
  fresh, but that he so built up and fortified the Obvious, that not the most
  subtle and disingenuous mind, nor the biggest fool who ever sentimentalized
  and spouted, could escape honestly from its inexorable imperatives.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap3_02"
     name="chap3_02">2. &mdash; THOUGHT AND ACTION:<br>
  THE NEW MODEL OF REVOLUTION</a></h2>

  <p class="first">It is a wholesome check upon individual pride that no single
  man and indeed no single type of man is able both to conceive and carry
  through the simplest of our social operations. Even the man who cultivates
  the earth and grows food cannot make the productive implements he uses or
  select the seeds and plants that yield him increase. Defoe's queer story of
  Robinson Crusoe is an impossibly hopeful estimate of what a single man, with
  only a little flotsam and jetsam from the outer world, and in unusually
  benign climatic conditions, on a desert island could contrive to do for his
  own comfort and security. Still more does this interdependence of men and
  different types apply to the complex processes that now, in this Age of
  Maximum Insecurity, were demanded, if the new generation was to escape from
  the economic and institutional wreckage amidst which it found itself, and
  create the social order in which we live to-day.</p>

  <p>First came the intellectuals, men living aloof from responsibility, men
  often devoid of the qualities of leadership and practical organization. Like
  De Windt they planned everything and achieved no more than a plan. Such men
  are primarily necessary in the human adventure, because they build up a sound
  diagnosis of events; they reveal more and more clearly and imperatively the
  course that lies before the race and in that task their lives are spent and
  justified. Then it is that the intelligent executive type, capable of
  concentration upon a complex idea once it is grasped, and resisting
  discursiveness as a drag on efficiency, comes into action. Their imaginative
  limitation is a necessary virtue for the task they have to do. No man can
  administer a province successfully if he is always wandering beyond its
  frontiers. The rather unimaginative forcible type is the necessary executive
  of a revolution, and the benefit of the revolution is entirely dependent upon
  the soundness of the ideology with which he has been loaded.</p>

  <p>Because of this necessity for complementary types of revolutionary,
  history does not produce any modern equivalents to the legendary figures of
  Solon, Moses or Confucius in its story of the coming of the Modern State. De
  Windt was not so much a creator as a summarizer, a concentrator, a lens that
  gathered to a burning focus the accumulating mental illumination of his
  day.</p>

  <p>The light of understanding that lit the fires of this last revolution came
  from no single brain. It came from ten thousand active and devoted minds,
  acting and reacting upon one another, without order or precedence; it was
  like the growth of physical and biological science that preceded it,
  something that happened as a whole, something that happened not in any single
  consciousness but in the consciousness of the race.</p>

  <p>We have already noted how far back the first germination of the World-
  State idea can be traced; we have shown how the forces of economic life drove
  towards it in the nineteenth century. We have displayed it working as a
  quasi-instinctive aspiration in the brains of Henry Ford and Woodrow Wilson.
  With De Windt's Social Nucleation we see it made concrete, with all its
  essential structures projected and all its necessary conditions laid down, a
  practicable proposal. The World-State has ceased to be a cloudy aspiration
  and it has become a plan. Forceful men could adopt it.</p>

  <p>A distinct change in the quality of those who were promoting the movement
  for the Modern State became very evident even before the War Cycle of the
  Forties. It was now sufficiently "thought out" for men of resolute character
  to incorporate it in their personal lives. It was passing over from the
  reflective to the energetic types. Its earliest propagandists had been
  largely reflective and practically ineffective individuals; a miscellany of
  pacificists whose dread and detestation of war was overwhelming and who had
  the intelligence to realize that war can only be avoided by establishing a
  World Pax; a number of writers, "pure" scientific workers, young
  sociologists, economists and the like and "intellectuals" from the working
  class movement. Now a multitude of engineers, architects, skilled foremen and
  industrial organizers, technicians of all sorts, business men and captains of
  industry, were also beginning to "talk Modern State" and put in an increasing
  proportion of their time and attention to its advocacy.</p>

  <p>The transition is easily explicable. The increasing social disorder was
  driving men of the vigorous practical type out of satisfactory employment.
  During the First Age of Prosperity, and during the false recovery after the
  World War, such men had been able to find ample work agreeable to their
  temperaments in the immense industrial developments of the time. They had
  organized great businesses, vast production; they had exploited the incessant
  stream of inventions; they had opened up the natural resources of hitherto
  backward regions. They had carried production far beyond the consuming power
  of human society. So long as all this enterprise could go on, it did not seem
  necessary to them to trouble about the political and monetary methods of
  their world. Now and then some of them showed a certain restiveness at the
  banking network; our typical original-minded industrial Henry Ford, for
  instance, had two vigorous tussles with the bankers during his career; but
  generally the phenomena of political and financial strangulation only began
  to compel their serious attention after the great Hoover Slump (the Thirty
  Year Slump) was well under way.</p>

  <p>Then they began to think, talk and write about the social order with the
  energy of men accustomed to handle large affairs and work for immediate
  tangible results. The vast experiment of Soviet Russia aroused their
  technical jealousy and a sort of envious impatience both at its opportunities
  and its incapacities. And the young men coming on from the abundant technical
  schools of the time, stirred by the books and talk and omnipresent hopes and
  memories of the immediate past, and looking for adventure and achievement in
  material enterprise, realized very rapidly that the lights of opportunity
  upon their paths were being turned down in a manner at once mysterious and
  exasperating.</p>

  <p>The revolutionary movement in the nineteenth century had seemed to such
  men a tiresomeness of slacking workers, aided and abetted by critics like
  Ruskin, artists like William Morris, playwrights like Bernard Shaw and
  suchlike impracticable and unconvincing people. It was associated in their
  minds with sham Gothic, yellow-green draperies, long hair, anti-vivisection
  and vegetarianism. There was scarcely a man of scientific or technical
  eminence on the revolutionary side before 1900. But by the third decade of
  the twentieth century two-thirds of the technicians, scientific workers and
  able business organizers were talking active revolution. It was no longer to
  be a class insurrection of hands; it was to be a revolt of the competent.
  Their minds were feeling round for ideas. They found in such books as De
  Windt's exactly what they wanted. They began to set about the evocation of
  the Modern World-State in no uncertain fashion.</p>

  <p>A revolution in revolutionary ideas had occurred. The protean spirit of
  Revolution had cut its hair, put on blue overalls, made blue prints for
  itself, created a New Model, and settled down to work in a systematic
  fashion.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap3_03"
     name="chap3_03">3. &mdash; THE TECHNICAL REVOLUTIONARY</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The existence of this large number of scientific and
  technical workers in the Western communities and their rapid and lively
  apprehension of the breakdown about them is one of the profoundest
  differences between the second and the first Decline and Fall.</p>

  <p>We find no real equivalent at all to them in the Roman story. There were
  great numbers of artisans without any science, steeped in tradition; and
  quite out of touch with these artisans there were a few small groups of
  ineffective philosophers whose speculations were finally swamped by the
  synthesis of Christianity. Artisan and philosopher were in different worlds.
  The philosopher has left it on record that he despised the artisan. Probably
  the artisan despised the philosopher in equal measure so far as he knew about
  him; but he has not left it on record. Neither artisan nor philosopher seem
  to have had any awareness of the broad social forces that were destroying the
  common security in which they went about their affairs, and turning the
  Empire into a battling ground for barbarian adventurers.</p>

  <p>It is doubtful if at any time the imperial court or the imperial civil
  service had any real conception of any sustained decline.
  Nineteenth&mdash;and twentieth-Century historians, as Ogilvy and Freud point
  out in their Roman History (2003 and revised by Pan Chow Liang 2047), were
  all too apt to imagine an up-to-date intelligence for such emperors as Julius
  Caesar, Octavius, Marcus Aurelius or Domitian. They represented them as
  scheming and planning on almost modern lines. But there is no proof of any
  such awareness in the Latin record. One large element in that old Roman world
  that would surely have displayed some sense of the needs of the time, if
  anywhere there had been that sense, was the universally present building
  industry. It did hold on in a way throughout the decline and fall, but
  consciously it did nothing politically.</p>

  <p>Students are still working out the preservation and continuation of the
  art and mystery of the masons into the middle ages. There was a great loss of
  knowledge but also a real survival. The medieval free-masons who built those
  flimsy but often quite beautiful Gothic cathedrals it is now such a task to
  conserve, carried on a tradition that had never really broken with that of
  the pyramid builders. But they had no sense of politics. They had a tradition
  of protective guild association similar to the Trade Unions of the Capitalist
  age, they interfered in local affairs in order to make jobs for themselves,
  but there is no sign that at any time they concerned themselves with the
  order and stability of the community as a whole. Their horizons were below
  that level of intelligence.</p>

  <p>Now the skilled and directive men of the collapsing order of the twentieth
  century were of an altogether livelier quality. Their training was not
  traditional but progressive, far more progressive than that of any other
  class. They were inured to fundamental changes in scope, method and material.
  They ceased to be acquiescent in the political and financial life about them
  directly they found their activities seriously impeded. Simultaneously with
  the outbreak of that very expressive and significant word "Technocracy" in
  the world's Press (1932-33) we find, for instance, a Professor of
  Engineering, Professor Miles Walker, at a meeting of the British Association
  for the Advancement of Science, boldly arraigning the whole contemporary
  order by the standards of engineering efficiency. Everywhere in that
  decadence, amidst that twilight of social order, engineers, industrialists
  and professors of physical science were writing and talking constructive
  policies. They were invading politics. We have already noted the name of
  Professor Soddy as one of the earlier men of science who ceased to "mind his
  own business", and took up business psychology.</p>

  <p>At first these technicians and business men were talking at large. They
  did not immediately set about doing things; they still assumed that the
  politicians and monetary authorities were specialists with sound and thorough
  knowledge in their own departments, as capable of invention and adaptation as
  themselves; so that they did no more than clamour for decisive
  action&mdash;not realizing that the very conditions under which bankers and
  politicians lived made them incapable of varying their methods in any
  fundamental fashion. But this grew plain as disaster followed disaster. A new
  type had to assume authority if new methods were to be given a fair chance.
  New methods of government must oust the old. An increasing proportion of the
  younger men, abandoning all ideas of loyalty to or cooperation with the old
  administrative institutions, and with an ever clearer consciousness of their
  objective, set themselves to organize nuclei after the De Windt pattern and
  to link these up with other nuclei.</p>

  <p>The movement spread from workshop to workshop and from laboratory to
  laboratory with increasing rapidity all over the world. Al Haran estimated
  that already in 1960 seven-eighths of the aviators were Modern State men, and
  most of the others he says were "at least infected with these same ideas".
  Such infection went far and deep.</p>

  <p>Wherever there was little or no repression the development of this
  movement to salvage civilization went on openly. But to begin with it
  encountered some very serious antagonisms. The military element had always
  been disposed to regard the man of science and the technician as a gifted
  sort of inferior. The soldier in his panoply ordered them to do their tricks,
  and they did their tricks. That was the idea. The behaviour of both types
  during the World War did much to confirm this assumption of their docility.
  The Peace of Versailles came before there was any serious disillusionment.
  The nineteenth-century scientific man had been a very lopsided man; often he
  had proved himself a poor conventional snob outside his particular
  investigations.</p>

  <p>"The sciences," as Simon Azar remarked, "came before Science"; the
  scientific outlook was a late result and not a primary cause of the
  systematic pursuit of knowledge. It was a discovery and not a starting point.
  Science taught the men who served it, and the pupil learnt more than the
  teacher knew. There was and is an incessant conflict in the scientific world
  between achievement and fresh enquiry, and in the nineteenth and early
  twentieth centuries it was acute. The older men suspected younger men with
  broader ideas and hindered their advancement. They wanted them all to work in
  specialist blinkers. But after the World War the world of pure and applied
  science found itself obliged to think about things in general, and, as the
  Great Slump went on without surcease, it thought hard. The technicians,
  because of their closer approach to business and practical affairs generally,
  were considerably in advance of the "pure" scientific investigators in this
  application of constructive habits of thought to political and social
  organization.</p>

  <p>Even during the Chinese warfare there were intimations that chemists,
  engineers and doctors might have different ideas from the military. After the
  Tokio sterilization fiasco, and still more so after the failure of the
  eleventh gas offensive upon Wuchang to produce adequate results, the Japanese
  military authorities began to enquire into the possibility of "expert
  sabotage", and their enquiries had a certain repercussion upon the relations
  of "scientific" military men to real scientific and technical experts in
  Europe. There was an attempt to distinguish between experts who were "loyal"
  and experts who were "subversive". More often than not it was the latter who
  were the brilliant and inventive men. Uncritical loyalty was found to go with
  a certain general dullness. The authorities found themselves in a dilemma
  between men who could not do what was wanted of them and men who would
  not.</p>

  <p>A campaign against pacificist, disturbing and revolutionary ideas had been
  gathering force during the thirties. It became a confused and tiresome
  persecution in the later forties. But it was ineffective because it was
  incoherent. Attempts to weed the staffs and students of technical schools and
  to reduce the teaching profession to docility failed, because there seemed to
  be no way of distinguishing what was essential science from what was
  treasonable thought. The attempt to destroy freedom in one part of a man's
  brain while leaving other parts to move freely and creatively was doomed to
  failure from the outset.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap3_04"
     name="chap3_04">4. &mdash; PROPHETS, PIONEERS, FANATICS AND MURDERED
     MEN</a></h2>

  <p class="first">History, especially general history, is prone to deal too
  much with masses and outlines. We write that "all Germany" resented an
  insult, or the "hopes of Asia" fell. But the living facts of history are
  changes in thought, emotion and reaction in the minds of thousands of
  millions of lives.</p>

  <p>In the preceding sections we have spoken in general terms of "concepts of
  combination" developing; of ideologies dissolving and giving place to other
  ideologies like clouds that gather and melt and pass across the mental skies
  of mankind. In the books before those sections we traced the growing
  awareness of a possible World-State in the thoughts of men throughout two
  thousand years of slow awakening. But the presentation is incomplete until we
  have turned our attention, for a chapter at least, from the broad sweep of
  opinion and the changing determination of the collective will, to the texture
  of individual experiences, the brain storms, the tormented granules, which
  shaped out these massive structural developments.</p>

  <p>One must draw upon the naive materials of one's own childhood to conceive,
  however remotely, the states of mind of those rare spirits who looked first
  towards human brotherhood. One must consider the life of some animal, one's
  dog, one's cheetah or one's pony, to realize the bounded, definite existence
  of a human being in the early civilizations. The human life then was just as
  set in its surroundings as any animal's. There was the town, the river, the
  cultivations, the distant hills, the temple, near friends and strange distant
  enemies constituting a complete and satisfying ALL. The gods were credible
  and responsible, taking all ultimate responsibility off your shoulders; the
  animals had souls like yourself, as understandable as yourself, and the
  darkness and shadows were haunted by spirits. In that sort of setting
  innumerable generations lived and loved and hated and died. Everything was
  made familiar and understandable by the trick of personification. You brought
  the stranger into your family; you made it a member of your group. Earth was
  a mother and the sun a great father of glory marching across the sky.</p>

  <p>It is a marvellous intricate history to trace how the human mind began to
  doubt, to pry and question, to penetrate the curtains of assurance and
  fancied security that enclosed it. Perhaps it was rather torn out of its
  confidence than that it fretted its way out by any urgency of its own.</p>

  <p>The Hebrew Bible, which Christianity preserved for us, is a precious
  record of uneasy souls amidst the limited conditions of these ages before
  mechanism or travel or logical analysis. It tells how man came out of the
  Eden of unquestioning acceptance and found perplexity. It gives us intimate
  glimpses of states of mind that were typical of what went on in hundreds of
  thousands of struggling brains. They were beginning to note thorns and weeds,
  toil and the insecurity of life. They made great efforts to explain their
  growing sense that all was not right with the world. They had to dramatize
  the story. They had as yet only "personification" as a means of apprehending
  relations and causes. They had no way of getting hold of a general idea
  except by imagining it as a person. Strange thoughts frightened them. They
  seemed exterior to them. They dared not even say "I think"; they had to say
  "I heard a voice" or the "Word of the Lord came to me". Enormous effort
  therefore was needed to pass from the thought of a patriarchal tribal God to
  a mightier overriding God. Men did not unite communities; they identified
  their Gods. Monotheism was the first form of the World-State in men's
  minds.</p>

  <p>What a desperate deed it was for some inwardly terrified man to lift up
  his voice against the local elders and the local idol, proclaiming "There is
  no God but God." The reactions of his fellows, living still within the
  framework of accepted beliefs, to this attempt to break out to wide
  relations, were scorn, amusement, irritation, dislike or horror and
  superstitious fear. We have the story of Mohammed recorded, and of his fight
  with the gods of Mecca, but that was a late and sophisticated instance of
  something that happened in innumerable times and places; the challenge of the
  man "inspired" by his new idea to the social mental nest out of which he was
  breaking.</p>

  <p>Men who saw the light and spoke, were only one species of a larger genus
  of human beings whose minds worked differently from the common man's or were
  simply more feverishly active. The others were eccentrics or downright
  madmen. One sort was hardly to be told from another, for both were sayers of
  incredible things.</p>

  <p>The beginning of written record in the millennium before Christ shows a
  long tradition already established for the treatment of these odd, disturbing
  exceptions. So far as we can peer into the past we find the tranquillity of
  the everyday community broken by these troubled troublesome individuals who
  went about, living queerly, saying unusual and disconcerting things, inciting
  people to behave strangely, threatening divine anger, foreboding evils. There
  was a disposition to buy them off with a sort of reverence&mdash;and
  disregard. Inferior and unhappy people might find an interest and excitement
  in their strange announcements and suggestions. But rulers did not like them,
  comfortable people disliked and feared them. They irritated, they terrified
  contented people. They seemed perverse, and many of them plainly were
  perverse. If they went too far mankind turned on them and they were
  ill-treated and mobbed and ridiculed; they were cast into prisons; beaten and
  killed.</p>

  <p>The ones that mattered most seemed always, by our present standards, to
  have had something to say that was at once profoundly important and yet not
  quite true or not quite truly said. Disciples, sometimes in great multitude,
  respond to their enigmatical utterances. When they died or were killed men
  were left asking, "What exactly did he say? What exactly did he mean?" The
  inspired words became very readily riddles for interpreters and matter for
  pedantry. They were phrased and rephrased, applied and misapplied, tried out
  in every possible and impossible way.</p>

  <p>Nowadays we find a common quality in all these madmen, prophets, teachers
  and disturbers of the mental peace. The species was learning to talk and use
  language. The race was, as it were, trying to think something out; was
  attempting to say something new and enlarging to itself. It was doing this
  against great resistance. Its intellectual enterprise was playing against its
  instinctive fear of novelty. Some of these teachers died terribly, were
  flayed or burnt or tortured to death. One hung on a cross and died of
  physical weakness some hours before the two felons who were his hardier
  fellow sufferers, leaving a teaching compounded of such sweet and fine ideas
  of conduct, such mystical incomprehensibleness, such misleading
  inconsistency, that it remained a moral stimulus and an intellectual
  perplexity, a jungle for heresies and discoveries, for millions of souls for
  two millennia.</p>

  <p>Vainly does one try nowadays to put ourself into the mind of the prophet
  led to execution. We know the value of what he did, it is true, but what did
  he think he was doing? The secret of such personifying, urgently seeking
  brains seems hidden from us now for ever.</p>

  <p>In the busier and more prosperous social phases of history such disturbers
  are less evident; in times of change, and especially when there was also a
  release of social energy, when conflicting traditions ground and wore upon
  each other, these troubled and troublesome minds seemed to have multiplied.
  The days of the vast unstable Roman imperialism abounded in efforts to say
  something new and profound about life. Everywhere there were new worships,
  because a worship still seemed the only form in which a new idea and way of
  life could be conveyed from mind to mind. Everywhere the puzzled sprawling
  human race was trying to say something, some magic word to resolve its
  perplexities and guide it to peace.</p>

  <p>With the Renascence of learning and the onset of organized science the
  actual number and the actual proportion of enquiring and innovating minds
  increased greatly. The effort of the racial mind to master the conditions of
  its being was renewed on a multitudinous scale. But now the disturbers of
  equanimity no longer appear as wild-eyed prophets; they no longer claim that
  the Word of the Lord is upon them. Abstract and logical thought has pervaded
  the mind of the race and such personification is no longer needed. They do
  not denounce the old gods; they analyse them. Moreover, now that we approach
  modern times and deal with more and more abundantly recorded events, we begin
  to realize with a living understanding and sympathy what was going on in the
  minds of the innovators and to feel in touch with the immeasurable heroisms
  and innumerable tragedies of those later pioneers, those rebels, critics,
  revolutionaries who were thrusting, more or less intelligently, against the
  acceptances and inertias amidst which they lived, towards a saner, more
  comprehensive and more clearly apprehended racial idea.</p>

  <p>So far no completely masterly digest has been made of the millions of
  biographies and tons of other material that tell of the mental seething of
  the world from the seventeenth century of the Christian Era onward. If the
  old world prophets are too rare and remote for our understanding, the modern
  revolutionaries are almost too close and abundant for us to stand back and
  see them clearly. Vast studies have been organized of various portions of the
  field; Roger Cuddington and his associates' Studies of Protestant Thought in
  Holland, the Rhineland, Switzerland and Britain from the Seventeenth to the
  Nineteenth Century give, for instance, a picture of one wide area and period,
  in which the fermentation arose first in a religious form and owed much to
  the clash of Jew and Gentile; while Margrim's Early Forms of Anarchism and
  Socialism is a very successful attempt to realize the ideas and personalities
  from which the modern criticism of rule and property derived. With the help
  of such works as these, and with some luck among the biographies, we do
  contrive at last to get down close to an imaginative participation in those
  individual reactions, which in the aggregate remade the human community in
  the form we know to-day.</p>

  <p>Every one of these personal stories, if it were told completely, would
  have to begin with a child, taking the world for granted, believing its home,
  its daddy and mummy to be right and eternal. It confronted a fixed and
  established world with no standard of comparison in past or future. It was
  told its place in life and what it had to do. Bad luck, discomfort, some
  shock or some innate unrest was needed to put a note of interrogation against
  these certainties. Then for those whom destiny has marked for disturbance
  comes the suspicion: "This that they have told me isn't true." Still more
  disturbing came the possibility: "This that they do and want me to do isn't
  right." And then with a widening reference: "Things could be better than
  this." So the infected individual drifted out of easy vulgar living with his
  fellows, out of a natural animal-like acceptance of the established thing, to
  join the fermenting and increasing minority of troubled minds that made
  trouble.</p>

  <p>He began talking to his fellows or he made notes in secret of his
  opinions. He asked awkward questions. He attempted little comments and
  ironies. We could conjure up hundreds of thousands of pictures of such
  doubters beginning to air their opinions in the eighteenth-century world, in
  the little workshops of the time, in shabby, needy homes, in market places,
  in village inns, daring to say something, hardly daring to say anything,
  unable often to join up the vague objections they were making into any
  orderly criticism. But in the brown libraries and studies of the period other
  men were sitting, poring over books, writing with something furtive in their
  manner, while the pride of contemporary life brayed and trumpeted along the
  roadway outside. "What is being told to the people is not true. Things could
  be better than this." Men ventured on strange suggestions in university
  classes; brought out startlingly unorthodox theses.</p>

  <p>The infectious interrogations spread. Constituted authority got wind of
  these questionings and itself came questioning in search of heresy and
  sedition, with rack and thumbscrew. When we read the books and pamphlets of
  that awakening phase, writings which seem amidst profuse apologies to half
  say next to nothing, we get the measure of the reasonable timidities of the
  time. Men might pay in sweating agony and death for that next-to-nothing they
  had said.</p>

  <p>At first they raised not so much the substance as the form of an
  interrogation. In the sixteenth century you would have found a number of
  local accumulations of heresies, but hardly any inkling of the Modern State.
  Except for some scholar's echo to the Republic or Laws of Plato, there was no
  one at all reading and comparing in the field of social and political
  structure before the seventeenth century. The eighteenth century was, in
  comparison with its predecessor, an age of voluminous revolutionary thought.
  Men began calling fundamental ideas and political institutions in question as
  they had never been challenged since the onset of Christianity. They went
  into exile for their innovations; their books were burnt; censorships were
  established to suppress these new ideas. Still they spread and multiplied.
  The authoritative claim of aristocracy, the divinity of monarchy, tarnished,
  dwindled, became ineffective under these dripping notes of interrogation.
  Republics appeared and the first embryonic intimations of socialism.</p>

  <p>In our account of the first French Revolution and the revolutionary
  perturbation of the eighteenth century* we have had to discriminate between
  the economic and social forces that were forcing political readjustment on
  the one hand, and the influence of new ideas on the other. We have shown how
  little these formal changes were planned, and how small a share in these
  events is to be ascribed to creative intention or mental processes generally.
  Nevertheless the questioning was drawing closer to reality and the scope of
  the planning was spreading. We will not tell again of the profound change in
  men's ideas about private property, private freedom and monetary
  relationship, that began to find expression in the socialist and communist
  movements of the age. Our concern here is to emphasize the billions of small
  wrangles that were altering the collective thought, to summon out of the
  past, for an instant, an elfin clamour of now silenced voices that prepared
  the soil for revolution, the not-at-all-lucid propagandists at street
  corners, the speakers in little meeting-houses, in open spaces and during
  work intermissions; to recall the rustle of queer newspapers that were not
  quite ordinary newspapers; and the handicapped book publications that were
  everywhere fighting traditional and instinctive resistances. Everywhere the
  leaven of the Modern State was working&mdash;confusedly.</p>

  <p>* [No traces of this account are to be found in Raven's
  papers.&mdash;Ed.]</p>

  <p>As we have seen, the new conception of a single world society did not come
  at one blow, perfect and effective, into the human mind. It was not completed
  even in outline until the days of De Windt, and before that time it was
  represented by a necessary confusion of contributory material, incomplete
  bits of it and illogical and misleading extensions of those bits. It had to
  begin like that; it had to begin in fragments and rashly. There was always a
  fierce disposition manifested to apply the new incomplete ideas, headlong and
  violently. The more the sense of insufficiency gnaws at a man's secret
  consciousness, the more he is in conflict with an inner as well as an outer
  antagonist, the more emphatic, dogmatic and final he is apt to be. That
  disposition to bring the new ideas to the test of reality, the urge to assert
  by experiment, was the chief source of trouble for these ever increasing
  multitudes, of innovating minds. Constituted authority, established usage,
  have no quarrel with ideas as such; it is only when these ideas become
  incitation, when they sought incarnation in act and reality, that conflict
  began.</p>

  <p>So all over the world throughout the nineteenth century men were to be
  found contriving trouble for authority and devising outrages on usage. The
  light of world reconstruction lit their souls, but often it filtered through
  thick veils of misconception and had the colourings of some epidemic hate.
  They dreamt of insurrections, of seizures of power, of organized terror; in
  practice their efforts dwindled down too often to stupid little
  murders&mdash;often completely irrelevant murders&mdash;to shouting and
  swarming in the streets, to peltings and window-breaking, to blowing in the
  front doors of government houses and embassies, to the casting of explosives
  amidst the harmless spectators at public ceremonies.</p>

  <p>Before the French Revolution there was not nearly so much of such sporadic
  violence as afterwards. There were a few assassinations by religious or
  racial fanatics, but usually the older type of political crime was definitely
  connected with some conspiracy to change the personnel rather than the nature
  of a régime. The "Anarchist" outrages of the nineteenth century, however
  clumsy, were by comparison social criticisms. Behind them, even though vague,
  exaggerated and distorted, was the hope of a new world order.</p>

  <p>Linked inseparably with all these premature expressions of the desire for
  a new life were the activities of more extensive revolutionary systems:
  printing-presses in cellars, furtive distribution of papers, secret meetings,
  the savage discipline of fear-ruled illegal societies, the going to and fro
  of emissaries &mdash;men often with narrow and ill-assorted minds, but
  nevertheless men with everything to lose and little to gain or hope for by
  such activities. After we have allowed for every sort of resentment and
  bitter impulse in them, the fact remains such men were devotees. They were a
  necessary ferment for the spread of thought.</p>

  <p>That increasing revolutionary ferment, in all its tentative aspects, used
  to be called The Extreme Left. There had never been anything quite like it in
  the world before. For the most part these men had broken not only with the
  political and social order of their time, but with its religious beliefs.
  Between 1788 and 1965, hundreds of thousands of men and thousands of women,
  far braver than any Moslem fanatics, sustained by no hope of a future life,
  no hope of any greeting after the sudden blankness of their untimely deaths,
  and, so far as we can gather now, not even with a clear vision of the full
  and ordered social life for which they died, stood up sullenly or with a
  certain sad exaltation to face the firing party or the halter. A hundred
  times as many endured exile, prisons, ostracisms, beatings, gross
  humiliations and the direst poverty for the still dimly apprehended cause of
  human liberation.</p>

  <p>They had not even the assurance of unanimity. They were all convinced that
  there had to be a better world, but they had not the knowledge, they had not
  the facilities for free and open discussion, to clear up and work out the
  inevitable outline of their common need. They formulated their ideas dully
  and clumsily; they went a certain way to truth and then stopped short; they
  suspected all other formulae than the ones they themselves had hit upon; they
  quarrelled endlessly, bitterly, murderously, among themselves. Nearly all
  sooner or later were infected by hate. Often it happened that two men, each
  of whom had roughly half the justice of things in him, killed each other,
  when indeed they needed only to put their prepossessions together to get the
  full outline of a working reconstruction.</p>

  <p>Da Silva has called all those who made the revolutions and revolutionary
  efforts that occurred between 1788 and 1948 the "revolutionaries of the half-
  light". His studies of the tangled history of the new social concepts that
  broke through to open popular discussion, only after the establishment of the
  Soviet régime in Russia in 1917, constitute a very brilliant work of
  elucidation and simplification. It is a history of twilight that ends at
  dawn. In the twenties and thirties of the twentieth century the ordinary man
  in the street was discussing, cheaply perhaps, but freely, ideas,
  possibilities and courses of action that no one would have dared to whisper
  about, would scarcely have dared to think about, two centuries before. He
  scarcely knew a single name of the pioneers, fanatics and desperadoes who had
  won this freedom for his mind.</p>

  <p>The nature of the conflict was changing. That was very plain by 1940.
  Where there had been pioneers, there were now systematic explorers and
  surveyors; the teeming multitudes of our race were still producing devoted
  and sacrificial types, but the half light was now a cloudy daylight and the
  ordered analyses and plans of such men as De Windt were making understandings
  and cooperations possible that would have been incredible in the nineteenth
  century. In the nineteenth century revolution was suspected, forbidden, dark,
  criminal, desperate and hysterical. In the twentieth century it became candid
  and sympathetic. The difference was essentially an intellectual one; after a
  vast period of stormy disputation the revolutionary idea had cleared up. The
  sun of the Modern State broke through.</p>

  <p>Revolution still demanded its martyrs, but the martyrdoms were henceforth
  of a different character. Biographies of revolutionists before the Great War
  go on by night, amidst a scenery of back streets, cellars, prisons,
  suspicions and betrayals. Biographies of revolutionists in the final struggle
  to establish the Modern State go on in full daylight. It is reaction now
  which has taken to the darkness, to plots, assassinations, and illegal
  measures. The Modern State propagandist became less and less like an
  insurgent individual of some alien subject race; he became more and more like
  a missionary in savage country, ill-armed or unarmed, and at an immediate
  disadvantage, but with the remote incalculable prestige of a coming power
  behind him.</p>

  <p>The later death-roll of revolutionaries has fewer and fewer executions in
  it and an increasing tale of assassinations and deaths in public conflict. A
  larger and larger proportion of those who died for it were killed either by
  mobs or in fair and open fighting. And soon the idea of the Modern State had
  become so pervasive that the battles ceased to be for it or against it; they
  became, rather, misunderstandings between impatient zealots with a common
  end. In many conflicts the historian is still perplexed to determine which
  side, if either, can be counted as fighting for the Modern State.</p>

  <p>The analyses of De Windt made immense charities of understanding possible.
  Creative-minded men, though they hardened against the liar and the cheat,
  became less and less willing to fight the puerile adherent and the honest
  fanatic with a tiresome but honestly intended formula. "There," they said,
  "but for certain misconceptions and resolvable obsessions go our men," and
  set themselves at any risk or loss to the task of conversion. Just as Fascism
  in its time seized upon the ancient terroristic and blackmailing Mafia in
  Sicily and partly annexed it, partly changed it and so superseded it, just as
  the Nazi movement incorporated large chunks of the Communist party in its
  efforts to reformulate Germany, so now the Modern State fellowship grappled
  with the world-wide series of organizations which had superseded democratic
  institutions nearly everywhere, made every effort to capture the imaginations
  of their adherents, and showed the most unscrupulous boldness in seizing
  their direction whenever it could. The Modern State Movement differed from
  every preceding revolutionary movement in its immense assimilating power, due
  to the clearness of the objectives it set before men's minds.</p>

  <p>The difference between the revolutionary before the Great War and the
  revolutionary after that illuminating crisis is closely parallel to the
  difference between the old alchemist and the modern man of science; the
  former haunted by demons, goblins and spirits, warped by symbolic obsessions
  and cabalistic words and numbers, terribly alone with himself, obsessed with
  religious fears, by fear of the inquisitor, by fear of the ruler above and of
  the rabble below, perpetually baffled in his attempts to achieve great
  things, but full of a dangerous unpremeditated knowledge of poisons and
  mischievous devices; the latter with a mind released by centuries of analysis
  and simplification, reassured by the incessant tale of scientific victories,
  stoically indifferent to popular misrepresentation and equally sure of his
  universe and himself.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap3_05"
     name="chap3_05">5. &mdash; THE FIRST CONFERENCE AT BASRA: 1965</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The conference of scientific and technical workers at Basra
  in 1965 is regarded by historians as a cardinal date in the emergence of the
  Modern State. It was organized by the Transport Union, which had begun as a
  loose association of the surviving aeroplane and shipping operators for
  mutual aid and protection. The ideas formulated at this conference&mdash;and
  even those were still formulated with a certain tentative or tactful
  incompleteness&mdash;had been gathering force and definition for some time.
  But this conference was the first to draw up a definite plan of the general
  human outlook and initiate an organization to carry it out. It marked the
  transition from thought to action in general affairs.</p>

  <p>The idea of using air transport as the combining and directive force for a
  new synthesis of civilization was already an old and familiar one. It had
  been in men's thoughts for at least thirty years. A popular story published
  in 1933, Man's Mortality (by the English romancer Michael Arlen, 1895-1990),
  for instance, is an amusing fantasy of the world dominated by an
  air-transport syndicate. It is still a very readable book and interesting in
  showing the limitations of the educated imagination at that time. The belief
  in the possibilities of invention is unbounded; air velocities and air
  fighting are described on a scale that still seems preposterously exaggerated
  to-day; while on the other hand the inflated stock buying and selling of that
  period, although it had grown from the merest germ in about a century and a
  half, is represented as still going on unchanged, and the world's air
  dictators are gambling dishonestly in stock, and at last "crash" financially
  and bolt as though they were just contemporary politicians and mystery men
  rather than lords of the whole power of the air. In a world of incredible
  metals, explosives and swiftness, the Stock Exchange, the Bourses, still
  survive. And there are still Powers and Foreign Policies! Nothing could
  illustrate better the inability of people at that time to realize the
  economic and political changes that were then actually tumbling upon them.
  For some obscure reason mental and moral progress and institutional invention
  seemed absolutely impossible to them.</p>

  <p>An interesting little London periodical of the same time, Essential News,
  has recently been reprinted for graduate students of history in the Students'
  Reprint Series. Its fourth issue (February 4th, 1933) contains a summary of
  contemporary thought about World Air Control. It cites a complete scheme for
  the "International" control of aviators, drawn up by a small French group at
  the suggestion of M. Henri de Jouvenal under the presidency of M. Pierre
  Denis. A Union Aéronautique Internationale is proposed, a cosmopolitan air
  transport company. Linked with this and controlled by the poor League of
  Nations, an "Air Force for Mutual Assistance" was to police the atmosphere.
  The proposals are so plainly Utopian and impracticable in the face of the
  sovereign state system as to seem insincere. It was only thirty years later,
  after the common suicide of the sovereign Powers of Europe, that the
  assembled technicians at Basra could revive the broad conception of this
  proposal.</p>

  <p>This first conference at Basra was distinguished from its predecessors
  first by its universality and then by the extremely bold and comprehensive
  proposals for united action it accepted&mdash;proposals which were in effect,
  if not in form, the project for the modern World-State. It was the first of
  these gatherings attended by considerable American, Chinese and Japanese
  contingents, as well as the customary European representatives, and the
  Russian technicians were present in unprecedented strength and unexpectedly
  united and independent of the political controllers who accompanied them. New
  Zealand also had reappeared in the world's affairs. There were even two
  representatives (two schoolmasters in the Social Psychology section) from
  Iceland, which for most practical purposes had been cut off from the world
  for over five years. And one has only to compare the agenda of this and
  previous assemblies to feel at once the stride forward in the scope and
  courage of scientific and technical thought that had occurred.</p>

  <p>It was a young gathering; the average age is estimated by Amen Rihani as
  about thirty-three, and five or six women attended in the social and
  educational branches. A third but very significant feature was the extensive
  use of that simple and convenient lingua franca of the aviators, Basic
  English. Even the native English-speaking people present did their best to
  keep their speeches within the limitations of that ingenious idiom.</p>

  <p>The master section was still that of General Transport. The body which had
  organized the gathering was, as has been said already, the Transport Union,
  originally a purely business body, but the inspiration was that of the Modern
  State movement, and technicians in medicine, education, agriculture and every
  main type of industrial production were present. There was much discussion of
  the upkeep of the world routes and the administrative tasks arising out of
  that. Nothing could give the student a more vivid sense of the derelict state
  of the world at that time than the boldness with which this Control took
  possession of things and pushed its activities into new fields. It was
  decided, for instance, that all existing aerodromes and landmarks, lights and
  lighting fields, should be directly under its management. There was no
  question of purchase; it took them over. Every aeroplane in the world was to
  be registered, was to carry a distinctive number, respect the common tariff
  of charges and pay a registration fee to the Control. Airships and aeroplanes
  which did not do this were to be treated as pirates, denied the use of
  aerodromes and filling stations, and "driven out of the air". They were to be
  driven out of the air if necessary by an "air police" which the Control was
  to organize. Aerodromes or regions that harboured such recalcitrants were to
  be boycotted.</p>

  <p>These proposals were not accepted without discussion. But there was very
  little protest against what was certainly, from the older point of view, an
  illegal usurpation of authority. The political members of the Russian
  contingent offered the chief resistance, and what other opposition appeared
  was not from aviators, engineers, chemists, biologists or men of that type,
  but from sociologists and economists of the less advanced schools. The main
  objection took the form of a question: "But what will governments say to
  this?" So far as the Westerners and Chinese were concerned there was a
  disposition to disregard the possibility of political intervention. "Wait
  till it comes," they said cheerfully. But Soviet Russia and Soviet Japan were
  at that time much more rankly political than the rest of the world, and they
  at least had politicians as well as men of skill and science present at this
  gathering. A long speech was made by the commissar Vladimir Peshkoff, full of
  the menace of later trouble. He denounced the projected Control as an
  insidious attempt to restore a capitalist trust in the world. Its psychology
  would be bourgeois and capitalist. Moscow would never consent to the passage
  of controlled machines over the vast territories under Soviet control nor
  allow the exploitation of the resources of Russia in oil and minerals by any
  outside organization.</p>

  <p>"And how will Moscow prevent it?" asked Ivan Englehart, a Russian aviator
  and aeroplane builder, rising as Peshkoff sat down. "Is it a nationalism of
  this sort that the Third International is to end?"</p>

  <p>By way of reply Peshkoff leant towards him and spat out in Russian, "Wait
  until you return to Moscow."</p>

  <p>"I may have to wait a little time," said Englehart. "I am a citizen of the
  world, and I shall go back to Russia in my own time and in my own
  fashion."</p>

  <p>"This is treason. Wait until Moscow hears of this!"</p>

  <p>"And how and when will Moscow hear of this?"</p>

  <p>"Very soon."</p>

  <p>Englehart was standing a few yards from Peshkoff. He shook his head with a
  sceptical smile. He spoke gently, like a man who had long prepared himself
  for such an occasion.</p>

  <p>"You flew here, Tavarish Peshkoff, in my squadron. How do you propose to
  return?"</p>

  <p>Peshkoff rose to his feet, realized the blank want of sympathy in the
  gathering, spluttered and sat down again in unconcealed dismay.</p>

  <p>Englehart waited for a moment or so and then went on, choosing his words
  with quiet deliberation, to assure the meeting of the adhesion of the Russian
  technicians to the projected Control. "That phantom Proletarian of yours
  fades with all the other empires and kingdoms," he said to the political
  delegates his colleagues. "We are only giving shape to a new world order that
  is already born."</p>

  <p>His speech set the key for most of the subsequent debate.</p>

  <p>That establishment of the Control was the backbone discussion, but it was
  no more than the backbone of a plan that covered the whole future
  organization of society; upon it was articulated a whole framework of
  structural proposals. The central section dealt not only with the air network
  but with the organization of every type of communication. The lighthouses,
  lightships, sea marks, channels and harbours of the world were suffering from
  a decade of economy, a decade of wartime destruction and a decade of chaos
  and decay. The meteorological services were no longer operative. All this had
  to be restored. The definite abandonment of every type of railroad was
  accepted as a matter of course. Railways were buried at Basra forever. And
  the restoration and reconstruction of production in a hundred essential
  industries followed also as a necessary consequence of these primary
  resolutions.</p>

  <p>The more the reader scrutinizes the agenda, the more is he impressed by
  the mildness of the official title of the gathering: "A Conference on
  Scientific and Mercantile Communications and Associated Questions". It is
  clear that the conveners resolved to press on with their task of world
  reorganization as far as they possibly could, without rousing the enfeebled
  and moribund political organizations of the past to obstruction and
  interference. The language throughout is that of understatement; the shape of
  the projects is fearlessly bold. A committee of experts had prepared a very
  good general survey of the natural resources of the planet, including those
  of the already suspicious Russia, and the conference set itself
  unhesitatingly to work out the problems of a resumption of production
  generally, with an entire disregard of the various proprietary claims that
  might arise to challenge the realization of these schemes. There was no
  provocative discussion of these claims; they were ignored. The Sea and Air
  Ways Control evidently meant to take effective possession not only of all
  derelict ports, aerodromes, coal-mines, oil wells, power stations and mines,
  but to bring those in which a certain vitality still lingered into line with
  its schemes by hook or by crook, by persuasion or pressure. Its confidence in
  its solidarity with the skilled men working these latter establishments was
  absolute. Such a solidarity would have been inconceivable thirty years
  before. Financial adventure had been washed out of the minds of the new
  generation of technicians altogether. They simply wanted to "get things going
  again". Ideas of personal enrichment were swamped in their universal
  conviction that their class must now either work together and master the
  world, or leave it.</p>

  <p>So with a modest air of logical necessity, of being driven rather than
  driving, the Conference spread its planning far beyond the material and
  mechanism of world intercommunication.</p>

  <p>What is this reconstructed transport to carry? How is it to be
  fed&mdash;and paid for? About the air-ports everywhere were tracts and
  regions sinking back to that primordial peasant cultivation which had been
  the basis of all the barbaric civilizations of the past. The question of the
  expropriation of the peasant and the modernization of agricultural production
  was taken up at Basra at the point where Lenin and Stalin had laid it down,
  defeated. The Conference was lucidly aware that upon the same planet at the
  same time you cannot have both an aviator and a starveling breeding
  peasantry, toiling endlessly and forever in debt. One or other has to go, and
  the fundamental objective of the Conference was to make the world safe for
  the former. The disappearance of the latter followed, not as a sought-after
  end but as a necessary consequence. And the disappearance of as much of the
  institutions of the past as were interwoven with it.</p>

  <p>In the ideas of their relations to each other and to the world as a whole,
  these Basra technicians were all what the nineteenth century would have
  called socialistic. They were so fundamentally socialistic that they did not
  even raise the question of socialism. It is doubtful if the word was ever
  used before. They took it for granted that this Control that was growing like
  a limitless polyp in their minds would be the effectual owner and exploiter
  of all the aeroplanes, routes, industrial townships, factories, mines,
  cultivations that were falling into place in their Plan. It would have seemed
  as unnatural to them that a new Ford or a new Rockefeller should arise to own
  a factory or a mine personally, as that anyone should try to steal the ocean
  or the air. There it was for the common good, and just as much was industrial
  plant for the common good.</p>

  <p>All these men it must be remembered, almost without exception, were men of
  the salaried type of mind. They had been born and brought up in a tradition
  in which money was a secondary matter. From the beginning of the mechanical
  age, the men of science, the technical experts, the inventors and
  discoverers, the foremen and managers and organizers, had been essentially of
  the salariat. Some few had dabbled in finance and grown rich, but they were
  exceptions. Before the World War indeed these sort of men had been accustomed
  to accept the acquisitive and gambling types, the powerful rich and owning
  people, as a necessary evil. Now they were manifestly a totally unnecessary
  evil, and without the least vindictiveness or animosity plans were made to do
  without them and prevent their return. The Basra Conference would as soon
  have considered a return of Foreign Offices or of Kings or Divinities.</p>

  <p>But they had to consider&mdash;and this was the work of a powerful section
  upon which the Americans were exceptionally active&mdash;how the wealth of
  the world that they meant to restore had to be distributed for consumption,
  and how a close-knit world organization was to be reconciled with personal
  freedom and particularly with artistic and literary initiatives. This was
  entitled the Section of Wages, Charges and Supply.</p>

  <p>There seems to have been the completest agreement that the only way of
  combining service with private liberty is by the use of money. Without money
  there is necessarily a dictation of consumption and a dictation of movement
  to the worker. He would be given "what was good for him". But money
  generalized the claim of the worker as worker, and the claim of the citizen
  as shareholder in the commonweal, upon the goods, pleasures, facilities and
  liberties of life. You take your money and you buy this or that, or go here
  or there, or do whatever you please. But there were dangers in this
  invention; twice in history money had failed mankind and a money-linked order
  had crashed. This time, they thought, mankind had learnt its lesson, and a
  new money had to be devised that would be, in any large sense, fool-proof,
  sneak-proof and scoundrel-proof. So much lay beneath the intention of the
  Section of Wages, Charges and Supply.</p>

  <p>This section carried the question of money into regions that would have
  seemed quite outside its scope thirty years before. In the Twenties and
  Thirties of the century, and indeed into the war troubles of the Forties,
  there had been a great volume of discussion about money. Men had realized its
  dangers and set themselves, with the energy born of a sense of crisis, to the
  analysis of its progresses and the invention of new methods that should
  prevent the gross accumulation of ownership, the mischievous manipulation of
  credit, the relative impoverishment of the worker and the strangulation of
  enterprise that had wrecked the second monetary civilization. Gradually it
  had been realized that there could be no Theory of Money that was not in fact
  a complete theory of social organization. The Conference set itself now to a
  prepared and simplified task.</p>

  <p>The interdependence of monetary theory with the general theory of property
  and social structure, which had hardly been suspected by their fathers, was
  now universally recognized. There was a considerable contingent of young
  lawyers present, though it would have amazed the previous generation beyond
  measure to find them in the ranks of technologists and men of science. They
  knocked the dust of centuries off the idea of ownership in these very
  pregnant debates. We have already mentioned the surprise of Nicholson at the
  new sort of law schools he found in America. At Basra the products of these
  schools were very much to the fore, together with several older teachers from
  the London School of Economics, which flourished until the landslide of 1968.
  These new lawyers, with their fundamentally scientific habits of mind, were
  amazingly unlike their professional predecessors&mdash;those obstinate,
  cunning and terrible old sinners who played so large a part in the economic
  strangulation of the United States and the frustration of all the high hopes
  of their founders. They had completely abandoned the pretence that the
  business of the law was to protect private property, exact debts and maintain
  a false appearance of equity between man and man. They knew that justice
  without equality of status and opportunity can be nothing more than a sham,
  and their ideas were already completely based on our current conception of
  law as the regulative system in the network of relationships between the
  human commonweal and its subordinate corporations and individuals. They were
  entirely contemptuous of any claims, contracts, rules and precedents that
  impeded the free expansion of human welfare. Among all the various types that
  gathered at Basra, these younger lawyers, in close touch with the new
  economists on the one hand and the group psychologists on the other, and
  inspired by a political constructiveness of the boldest sort, were certainly
  the most remarkable.</p>

  <p>It is chiefly to them that we owe the firm assertion by the Basra
  Conference of the principle that in a modern community there can be no
  individual property in anything but personal belongings and money. This was
  thrown out as something too obvious to discuss. Houses and lands were
  henceforth to be held on leases of a not too lengthy period, life tenure
  being the longest. All other tangible things, they assumed, belonged
  inalienably to the world commonweal&mdash;in the usufruct of which every
  human being was manifestly a shareholder. And it was these younger lawyers
  also who did the greater part of that task of disentanglement and
  simplification, which reduced money to its present and only proper use as a
  check for consumable goods and services, either paid out to the individual,
  or, in the case of minors and incapables, to the individual's guardians,
  either as a part of the racial inheritance or else as wages for work in the
  common service. The world was to be reborn without usury or monetary
  speculation.</p>

  <p>The monetary methods of the world at that time were in a state of such
  complete chaos that there was no effective system in working order anywhere
  to present an immediate resistance to the operation of the new ideas. Every
  region was running its own, often very arbitrary and primitive, system of
  tokens and checks. But the revival of communications that had made Basra
  possible was already giving an increasing prestige to what was known as the
  "air-dollar". This was not a metallic coin at all; it was a series of paper
  notes, which represented distance, weight, bulk, and speed. Each note was
  good for so many kilograms in so much space, for so many kilometres at such a
  pace. The value of an air-dollar had settled down roughly to a cubic metre
  weighing ten kilograms and travelling two hundred kilometres at a hundred
  kilometres an hour.</p>

  <p>This was already an energy unit and not a unit of substance, such as the
  old world standards had always been. It marked very definitely that the old
  static conceptions of human life with limited resources were giving place to
  kinetic ideas of a continually expanding life. The air-dollar was a unit of
  energy in terms of transport, and its transformation into the energy dollar
  of our daily life to-day was already sketched out clearly by the Basra
  experts, although the actual change over was not accomplished until ten years
  later.</p>

  <p>It was the plain, if unformulated, intention of the new Air and Sea
  Control to gain possession and exploit all the available sources of energy in
  the world as soon as possible, to frame its human balance sheet, scale its
  wages and declare its dividends as the common trustee of mankind, but
  manifestly if the threat of Peshkoff materialized, and the Russian Soviet
  system (or indeed any other owning group) was able to remain in effective
  control of its territorial wealth, the energy dollar would afford a just
  unambiguous medium for whatever trade was necessary between the competing
  administrations.</p>

  <p>The planning of a new political, industrial, and monetary world scheme
  still does not measure the full achievement of this First Basra Conference.
  There was also a strong and vigorous educational section working in close
  touch with the technicians and the social psychologists. It made plans not
  only for the coordination of the surviving colleges and technical schools in
  the world and for the revivification of those that had lapsed, but it set
  itself definitely to the task of that propaganda of the idea of the Modern
  State which is the substantial content of our existing fundamental education.
  This was dealt with by the Section of Training and Advertisement. Basic
  English was to lay the foundations of a world lingua franca. Evidently
  wherever the influence of the Air and Sea Control extended, a new propaganda,
  a new Press, and new common schools were to extend. There can be little doubt
  that most of the teachers at Basra already saw quite clearly ahead of them
  the world-wide mental and social order in which we live to-day. They knew
  what they were doing. They went back from this gathering encouraged and
  confirmed, to give themselves to the terrific and exalting adventure before
  them, to the evocation day by day, and idea by idea, of a new civilization
  amidst the distressful, slovenly, and still living wreckage of the old.</p>

  <p>When the Conference at last dispersed two new realities had appeared in
  the world, so unobtrusively that it was only slowly that the mass of mankind
  realized their significance. One was the Central Board, known also as the Sea
  and Air Control, consolidating the Transport Union, linking with it the other
  Controls and sections, and having its permanent offices at Basra; the other
  was the Police of the Air and Sea Ways, at first a modest organization with
  about 3,000 aeroplanes, a handful of seaplanes, a hundred patrol ships, and a
  personnel of about 25,000 men. It was a small body judged by the standards
  either of preceding or subsequent times, but at that period it was by far the
  most powerful armed force in the world.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap3_06"
     name="chap3_06">6. &mdash; THE GROWTH OF RESISTANCE TO THE SEA AND
     AIR-WAYS CONTROL</a></h2>

  <p class="first">For nearly ten years the Air and Sea Control was able to
  grow and extend its methods and influence without any general conflict. The
  little breeze between the Russian political control and the technicians did
  not rise to a storm; instead it died away. Russia was learning wisdom at last
  and weakening in her resolve to subordinate the modern scientific type of man
  to his old-fashioned demagogic rival. She had suffered so severely by the
  miscalculations and convulsive direction of her party chiefs; she was still
  so ill equipped mechanically, and so poorly provided with aviators, that the
  old and now mentally weary dictatorship recoiled from a new struggle with
  these and their associated technical experts. It is to be noted that, in
  spite of the closest espionage, the creed of the Russian aviators, engineers,
  and men of science was already the Modern State and not the Dictatorship of
  the Proletariat, and that her political rulers were beginning to understand
  this.</p>

  <p>So that the Air and Sea Control, sustained by a multitude of nuclei on De
  Windt's pattern scattered throughout the world, very much as the Bolshevik
  political organization had been sustained by the Communist Party, came into
  existence and spread its ever-growing network about the planet without an
  immediate struggle. Its revolutionary nature was understood by few people
  other than its promoters. It grew rapidly. As the Esthonian proverb says:
  "One must be born before one's troubles begin."</p>

  <p>The recovery of human prosperity in that decade between 1965 and 1975 was
  very rapid. It went on side by side with the expansion of the Transport
  system. By 1970 the Transport Control, the chief of the subsidiaries of the
  general Air and Sea Control, was running world-wide services that had as many
  as 25,000 aeroplanes aloft at the same time; it had possessed itself of
  shipyards on the Tyne, in Belfast, Hamburg, and a number of other points, and
  was building steel cargo ships by the score; it was creating a new system of
  high roads for which a number of the old main railway tracks were taken over,
  and it was running water-power stations, substituting our present chemical
  treatment of carboniferous strata for the terrible hand coal-mining of the
  older economy, and it was working oil. It had developed a subsidiary body,
  the Supply Control, which was rapidly becoming a vaster organization than its
  parent. This was engaged in producing iron and steel, producing or purchasing
  rubber, metals, cotton, wool and vegetable substances, and restoring the mass
  production of clothing of all sorts, electrical material, mechanisms, and a
  vast variety of chemicals of which the output had been dormant in some
  instances for twenty years or more.</p>

  <p>Never very clearly cut off from the Supply Control was the Food Control,
  which began ostensibly with the victualling of the Transport Services, and
  was soon carrying on a vast barter in food materials, its own surplus
  supplies and commodities generally throughout the world. In all its
  ramifications these three bodies were in 1970 employing about two million
  people, to whom wages were paid in the new modern dollars, energy dollars,
  good for units in Transport, housing, and for all the priced commodities
  handled by the Controls.</p>

  <p>The property of all these Controls was vested in the Modern State Society,
  which consisted at this time of about a quarter of a million Fellows, who had
  to be qualified up to a certain level of technical efficiency, who submitted
  to the Society disciplines during their years of active participation, and
  received wages varying by about 200 per cent above or below a mean standard,
  according to their standing. About a quarter of the other employees were
  student apprentices aspiring to fellowship, and of these the proportion was
  increasing. The Society had already developed the organization it was to
  retain for a century. The Fellows were divided into faculties for technical
  purposes; they voted by localized groups upon local issues and they had a
  general vote for the faculty delegations to the central council of the
  Society, which had its first seat at Basra contiguous to the central offices
  of the Three Controls. The relation of the Society to the Controls was not
  unlike the relation of the Communist Party to the Moscow Government in the
  early days of the Soviet system; it was a collateral activity of much the
  same people.</p>

  <p>It was the Society itself which at first directed the educational
  activities of the Modern State Movement. Wherever it had either its own
  "nuclei" or found employees of the Controls, it provided an elementary
  education of the new pattern, which involved a very clear understanding of
  the history and aims of the Modern State idea, and wherever it had works and
  factories and a sufficient supply of students, it founded and equipped
  science schools and technical schools, which included psychology, medicine,
  group psychology and administration. Gradually a special section of Training
  and Education was developed under the Air and Sea Control, and this grew into
  a separate Educational Control. But it never became as distinct from, and
  collateral to, the Modern State Fellowship as the rest of the Control
  organizations. One may figure the whole of this world system as a vast
  business octopus, with the Air and Sea Control as its head and the other
  Controls as its tentacles. The account-keeping of this octopus centred at
  Basra, but a rapid development of subsidiary record and statistical bureaus
  also occurred. Side by side grew the intelligence and research services. By
  1970, the world meteorological service was far in advance of anything that
  had ever existed before.</p>

  <p>But already this restoration of communications and circulation was
  producing effects far beyond the Fellowship and the power of employment of
  the associated Controls. The ebb in the vitality of human life had already
  passed its maximum and now began a restoration of activity everywhere, a
  fresh movement in the decaying towns, a new liveliness upon the countryside,
  a general reawakening of initiative, that were to confront the direction of
  this fast growing nexus of the Modern State, with challenges, difficulties,
  and menaces, that grew rapidly to tremendous proportions.</p>

  <p>It had been comparatively easy to spread throughout a prostrate and
  bankrupt world the new system of air and sea communications and trading that
  had been evolved. That world was too exhausted by war, famine, and pestilence
  and too impoverished to support extensive and aggressive political
  organizations. It was altogether another problem, even with the spreading
  "nuclei", the new schools and propaganda, to control and assimilate the
  populations that now, no longer living in want and insecurity, were beginning
  to feel a fresh strength and a renewed vigour of desire.</p>

  <p>Let us review the world situation about 1975. The Transport Control had
  usurped a monopoly of air and sea transport and was also monopolizing the use
  of its own new great roads. This gave it a practical ownership of the trade
  in staple products throughout the world. It was turning all the surplus
  products of its activities back, when its salaries had been paid, into
  strengthening its grip upon the general economy of mankind. By 1975 the
  Modern State Society counted just over a million Fellows, and in addition it
  was employing and training two million candidates, it was simply employing
  another three million and it had between seven and eight million youngsters
  in its new schools. They were all, we may note, not only given a sound
  training in physical science and biology, but were learning world history and
  so acquiring a world outlook in the place of the more limited views that had
  hitherto framed the ordinary political imagination, and they were being
  taught Basic English as a lingua franca. In ten wonderful years the Transport
  Control had grown far beyond the scale of any of the great Trusts or Controls
  of the opening years of the century. It had created a world currency. But it
  was still far from "owning the earth". Its own produce did not exceed an
  eighth of all the outside stuff that it bought and sold. Its own production
  was mainly fuel, metals and mechanisms. Food it bought, timber, vegetable
  oils, crude rubber, for example. Several hundred millions of human beings
  were still self-subsisting, quite out of its scheme, or dealing with it only
  for a few manufactured articles and mass produced commodities. And other
  hundreds of millions were rapidly developing, or rather recovering, a
  collateral productivity in relation to or in rivalry with its activities.</p>

  <p>The chief difficulties before the Modern State movement arose out of this
  parallel to its own rapid success. It was calling into existence a mass of
  exterior prosperity far beyond its immediate power of assimilation.
  Propagandists and teachers, advisory traders and competent directive agents
  are not made in a day. The strain upon the supply of ability, loyalty, and
  complete understanding in the movement was already being noted in 1970. In
  1972 we hear of a "scrutiny of qualifications", and new rules were made for
  the lapsing and expulsion of incompetent and unsatisfactory Fellows. The
  controlling staff had to be enlarged continually, and the supply of men with
  the necessary character, knowledge of group psychology and understanding of
  the constructive theory of the movement was limited.</p>

  <p>"Let us serve", said Fedor Galland, who was already becoming a leading
  spirit upon the World Council, in a speech that was circulated in 1973; "let
  us not fall into factions; let us not group ourselves. We cannot afford
  bickering; we must not thwart and waste each other. We have done no more as
  yet than make a start. Remember the strangulation of Russia by Stalin.
  Remember those excellent chapters of De Windt against the spirit of
  opposition. The struggle for the Modern State has only begun."</p>

  <p>Here we have the clearest indication that growth strains were already
  apparent within the structure of the still infantile Modern State.</p>

  <p>But if the movement found difficulty in sustaining its internal unanimity,
  there was at least this in its favour, that, outside it, there was no single
  world-wide framework in which antagonisms could concentrate. The old
  international banking system was dead and gone, and the new order issued its
  new money and was free to create and dominate the financial organization of
  things. The old armament-dealing interests were dead and buried. The old
  nationalist Press systems were dead and already forgotten. It is
  extraordinary with what rapidity this latter aspect of social life was
  forgotten, seeing that up to 1940 at any rate it was the primary medium of
  collective thought and opinion. To-day a copy of a newspaper of any date
  between 1890 and 1970 is a rare and precious thing, which has to be protected
  from carbonization in an air-proof wrapper. The Central Board controlled most
  of the new paper supplies as well as the now rapidly reviving telegraphic,
  telephonic and air transmission systems.</p>

  <p>The resistances and antagonisms it had to encounter, within its
  organization and without, were certainly immense, but they were extremely
  various; the dangers they developed never came together into one united
  danger, never rose to a simultaneous maximum and produced a supreme crisis.
  In this respect or that the advance of the Modern State might be fought to a
  standstill and held, but it was never put entirely upon the defensive, and
  since it held trade, money and its ever-spreading efficient common schools in
  its hands, time was always on its side. "If not to-day, to-morrow," said
  Arden Essenden. "But better to-day," said Fedor Galland.</p>

  <p>The rapidity with which the Transport Control of 1965 expanded into the
  Modern State octopus of 1975 accounts for quite another group of
  difficulties, as well as this initial difficulty of creating a personnel to
  keep pace with the perpetually elaborated task. This second group of troubles
  came from the fact that in habit and spirit the old order of things, the old
  ideas, the old methods, had not had time to die. That old world, blinded and
  enfeebled by its own errors, had staggered and fallen down in the Thirties
  and Forties, had lain in a coma in the Fifties. Throughout the Sixties the
  new world had come into existence. But in the brains of all the men and women
  alive who were more than forty years old, and in a great majority of those
  younger, more or less of the old world survived. The revival of human
  vitality in the Seventies involved not merely a renascence but a restoration.
  Old things came back to find their habitations still very imperfectly
  occupied by the new.</p>

  <p>Let us consider what form this opposition had taken and what were the more
  serious survivals of the old order&mdash;old "state of affairs" rather than
  "order" &mdash;still in active existence about 1975. We shall then have a
  clue to the history of the next seventy-five years.</p>

  <p>The task before the Air and Sea Control was essentially to leaven the
  whole world to its own pattern. Within its far-flung tentacles it embraced
  and sought to permeate with its own nature, with the concepts and methods of
  a commonweal of mutual service, a mass of some thousands and a half million
  human beings, still carried on by inertias established during thousands of
  generations. Morowitz calculates that in 1976 about sixty per cent of this
  mass was living directly upon the seasonal cultivation of the soil, and that
  two-thirds of this, throughout the temperate zone, was producing mainly for
  its own consumption and not for trade. He thinks this was a relapse from the
  state of affairs that obtained about 1910-1920. An emancipation from the
  soil, an abolition of the peasant, had then been in progress for more than a
  century. Large-scale production, with an abundant use of machines, had so
  increased the output per head as to liberate (if it can be called liberation)
  a growing proportion of hands for industrial work or unemployment. But this
  process had been reversed after 1940. From that date onward there was a drift
  back of workers to the land, to live very incompetently and wretchedly.</p>

  <p>The abolition of the self-subsisting peasant had been the conscious
  objective of Lenin and Stalin in Russia. The cultivator, with increasing
  ease, was to produce fundamental foodstuffs far beyond his own needs and to
  receive for his surplus an ever increasing variety of helps, comforts and
  amenities. Millions of the cultivators in 1910 were cultivating entirely for
  the market; they produced cotton, hemp, rubber or what not, and were as
  dependent on the provision shop for their food as any townsman. The social
  crash had ended all that. In the Famished Fifties, as Morowitz says, everyone
  was "scratching for food in his own patch". In the Sixties the common way of
  life throughout the world was again immediate production and consumption.
  Only under the direction and stimulus of the Transport Control did the
  workers upon the soil begin to recover the confidence and courage needed to
  produce beasts only for sale and crops only for marketing.</p>

  <p>The ambition of the Modern State Fellowship was to become the landlord of
  the planet and either to mine, afforest, pasture, and cultivate directly or
  to have these tasks performed by responsible tenants, or groups and
  associations of tenants under its general control. But at the outset it had
  neither the personnel nor the power to carry out so fundamental a
  reconstruction of human affairs. The comparative failure of the two Five Year
  Plans in Russia had been a useful warning against extravagant
  propositions.</p>

  <p>The Modern State did not mean, as the old saying goes, "to bite off more
  than it could chew". Its chief missionaries were its traders. They were more
  abundant than, and they did not need the same amount of training as, the
  Modern State schoolmasters and propagandists. They went offering contracts
  and prices to existing or potential food growers, cotton growers, rubber
  planters and operable mines; the Control did its best to guarantee sales and
  prices to any surviving factories, and it trusted to the selective power it
  had through transport, the new monetary issues, research and technical
  education to strengthen its grip as time went on and enable it to establish a
  general order in this worldwide mélange of bankrupt producers and
  impoverished customers it was restoring to activity.</p>

  <p>At first it made no enquiry as to the ownership of goods that were brought
  to its depots; it paid cash and observed its contracts; it attempted no
  discriminations between man and man so long as they delivered the goods and
  traded square. Its nuclei and schools were still propagandist schools in 1975
  and quasi independent of the trading, transport and industrial organizations
  that endowed them. But this was only the first stage in the Modern State
  undertaking. The next was to be more difficult.</p>

  <p>The student of history must always keep in mind the importance of lifetime
  periods in social and political change. Between 1935 and 1975 was only forty
  years. Everywhere old systems of ideas were still dominating men's brains and
  still being transmitted to the young. Old habits of thought, old values, old
  patterns of conduct, that had been put aside, as it were, just as jewels and
  fine clothes and many polite usages had been put aside, during the days of
  dire need and immediate fear, returned with returning self-respect. During
  the Famished Fifties the full creative scheme of the Modern State won its way
  to dominate the imaginations of at most a few score thousand minds, whose
  scientific and technical education had prepared them for it. After that the
  propaganda had been vigorous, but still, even after the Conference of Basra
  in 1965, the number of brains that could be reckoned as primarily Modern
  State makers probably numbered less than a couple of hundred thousand.</p>

  <p>The subsequent propaganda was still more swift and urgent, but the new
  membership was not always of the same thorough quality as the old. The
  society wanted the services of every man or woman it could incorporate with
  its Fellowship, but it did not want an inrush of half prepared adherents,
  refugees from moral perplexity requiring guidance, ambitious careerists.
  Every new religion, every church, every organized movement has known this
  conflict between the desire for expansion and the dread of dilution. On the
  one hand the Modern State recalled the headlong shallow mass conversions of
  Christianity and Islam, which had reduced those great faiths to a mere
  superstitious veneer upon barbarism, and on the other there was the more
  recent warning of Soviet Russia, morally and intellectually sterilized at
  last by the eternal espionage, censorship and "purges" of the G.P.U. The
  central brain of the Modern State octopus had to steer its world system of
  organization between the extremes of rash receptiveness and black suspicion.
  It had to go steadfastly and discreetly and yet it had to go swiftly. If, on
  the one hand, it found presently that its own Fellowship was not altogether
  as free as it had been at first from reactionary weaknesses and traditional
  sentiments, on the other it found that its leading ideas, by virtue of its
  material successfulness and of continual explicit statement, were spreading
  far beyond the limits of its nuclei and its organized teaching.</p>

  <p>In the economic realm there appeared, even from the first, intimations of
  a revival of prosperity, a number of developments that the Society, had it
  had the necessary resources, would gladly have nipped in the bud. It wanted
  to deal directly with every primary producer. To-day that is how things are.
  But so soon as there was a new demand for cotton, for rubber, for pork,
  wheat, rice and the like, a multitude of obliging intermediaries appeared
  between the negro cotton growers in America, the Sudanese cotton growers, the
  local folk who went into the largely abandoned rubber plantations to collect
  rubber again, the wheat farmers and swineherds and ranchmen, and set
  themselves to collect and handle the produce for the Control buyers and to
  distribute Control goods by retail in return.</p>

  <p>These people, the former business men of the world, emerged from the slums
  of decaying towns, from municipal offices, from their own reluctantly
  cultivated corners of land, from the dingy retreats of predatory bands, from
  small local trading establishments, full of the sense of trade revival. They
  organized loans to the peasants, contrived advances of material to them,
  advised them shrewdly, went officiously to the Control agents for
  instructions.</p>

  <p>This sort of intervention did not stop at individuals, nor with advices
  and promises. In many parts of the world, in townships and counties and small
  states, where a Town Council or Workers' Soviet or Mayor or Lord of the Manor
  was in authority, or where mines or plantations lay abandoned and neglected,
  the reviving breeze of buying produced a violent desire in the minds of men
  to set other people working for their profit. There were "Getting to Work
  Again" fêtes in America in 1969 to "stimulate local business".</p>

  <p>By 1975, from Manchuria to Cape Colony and from Vancouver to Java, the old
  state of affairs&mdash;peasants in debt, peasants working to pay rent,
  peasants bringing in goods in arrears, fishermen, miners, factory and gang
  workers generally, collectors and hunters, the old immemorial economic life
  of mankind &mdash;was recovering vigour. Debt serfdom was returning
  everywhere. Rents were rising everywhere. Everywhere the increasing surplus
  product was being intercepted according to time-honoured patterns. Even
  slavery was reappearing in thinly disguised forms.</p>

  <p>It had always been a strong tendency in the old order to utilize the
  labour of offenders against the law. Forced labour seemed so just and
  reasonable a punishment that whenever the possibility of using it profitably
  appeared the authorities set themselves to multiply indictable offences and
  bring luckless people into unpaid servitude. In the "classic" age most mines
  were worked and most galleys propelled by convicts. In the late Middle Ages
  the Mediterranean shipping waited on the magistrate, and if offenders did not
  appear in sufficient numbers they had to be sought for. Out of the dimness of
  the Fifties and Sixties into the returning publicity and activity of this
  phase of recovery there appeared everywhere local bosses, chiefs and
  political gangs inciting and driving people to the production of marketable
  goods. The Supply Control Report of 1976 on "Conditions of Labour Supplying
  Goods to Us" notes the existence of convict labour in North and South
  America, on the West Coast of Africa, in Soviet Russia, Central India, North
  China, Japan, Java and elsewhere, and states that in many districts it is
  hardly distinguishable from kidnapping.</p>

  <p>"The cheapness of human beings", runs the Report, "is once more impeding
  the efficient organization of mechanical production. Outside the range of our
  own services and factories, there are vast and increasing masses of people
  now living at a standard of life too low and under stresses too urgent for
  them even to begin to understand the objectives of the Modern State, and,
  drawing its sustenance from their degradation, there is arising again an
  intricate tangle of exploiting classes, entrepreneurs, wholesalers,
  retailers, money-lenders (lending the local coinages and exchanging against
  our notes), politicians, private and corporation lawyers, investors and
  landowners, of the most varied types, but all having one common
  characteristic, that they put profit before service and will resist and drive
  as hard a bargain as they can with our expanding organization. These things
  are returning about as fast as we are growing."</p>

  <p>The Transport Control Report of the same year notes another system of
  troubles arising. Here the attack on Modern State development was more
  direct. "We are finding the question of way-leaves an increasing difficulty
  in the extension of our road net for local and heavy traffic. The world, we
  are told more plainly every day, is not ours to do with as we like.
  Everywhere claimants are springing up, renascent corporations, local
  authorities or private individuals who profess ownership of the soil and
  demand rents or monetary compensation from us. In some cases, where the local
  authority was of such a character as to afford a reasonable hope of its
  ultimate absorption by our organization, we have been able to come to an
  arrangement by which it has taken over the making and maintenance of the
  route within the area of its alleged jurisdiction, but in the majority of
  instances the resistance is much more frankly in the nature of a hold-up. The
  enquiries of our social psychologists show a widespread desire for simple or
  disguised bribery on the part of the obstructives, though it has to be
  admitted that there are many genuine cases of quite disinterested stupidity.
  Few of them realize clearly that they are demanding bribes or exacting
  blackmail. They are obsessed by old-fashioned ideas of property; almost
  anything in existence they imagine can be appropriated as a man's 'own', and
  then he has an absolute right to do what he likes with his 'own', deny its
  use to the commonweal, destroy it, let it at a rack rent, hold it for some
  exorbitant price.</p>

  <p>"Rarely have these obstructives the whole-hearted support of their
  communities behind them&mdash;so much has to be conceded to the propaganda of
  the Modern State and to the general diffusion of our ideas and the
  spontaneous appearance of fresh and kindred idea systems. We are preparing a
  schedule of obstructives. They vary in scale from the single tiresome
  litigious individual with an old-fashioned clutching mind, through a long
  range of associations, cities and provincial councils, to the resuscitated
  sovereign governments of the war period. Two royal families have been exhumed
  from their retirement in the German-speaking part of Europe and more, it is
  said, are to follow. On various of our routes, notably on the Bordeaux-Black
  Sea road, the old Chinese claim for 'likin' has reappeared. Our lorries have
  been held up at Ventimiglia, where a 'dogana' has been erected by the Fascist
  government in Rome, a barrier has been put across the track, and payments
  have been demanded in the name of the King of Italy. There have also been
  demands for Octroi dues outside some French and Italian towns.</p>

  <p>"A legal committee of the Modern State Faculty of Social Psychology is
  taking up the question of these new impediments to world revival and
  unification, and it will prepare a plan of action in the course of the next
  month. This attempt to revive the proprietary strangulation which ended the
  old order is irritating and may develop into very grave obstruction. The
  former world system of ownership and administration was in complete
  liquidation before 1960, and we have no intention of buying it out at
  anything above scrap rates. We deny absolutely any claim to enhanced values
  created by our restoration of production and commerce."</p>

  <h2><a id="chap3_07"
     name="chap3_07">7. &mdash; INTELLECTUAL ANTAGONISM TO THE MODERN
     STATE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The earliest known histories are dynastic. They are little
  more than lists of priest-kings and kings and tribes and contributions. With
  Herodotus history became political. It was only in the eighteenth century
  (C.E.) that economic processes came into the story, and only after the time
  of Karl Marx that their essential importance was recognized. Later still,
  climatic, biological and geographical changes were woven into the historical
  tapestry. Not until the last hundred years have education, cultural
  influences and psychological sequences generally been given their proper rôle
  in the human drama.</p>

  <p>The most difficult thing in our understanding of the past is to realize,
  even in the most elementary form, the mental states of those men and women,
  who seem so deceptively like ourselves. They had bodies on exactly the same
  pattern as ours, if not so well exercised, well nourished and uniformly
  healthy; they had brains as capable as ours and as complicated. It is only
  when we compare their conduct with ours that we realize that, judged by their
  contents and their habits of reaction, those brains might almost have
  belonged to another species of creature.</p>

  <p>We read incredulously about the public burning of religious heretics, of
  the torture of criminals to enforce confession, of murders and outrages, of
  the offence of rape, of the hunting and tormenting of animals for "sport", of
  men and women paying money for the pleasure of throwing sticks at a tethered
  cock until it died, and it is hard to resist the persuasion that our
  ancestors were insane. Most of us, were we suddenly put back into the London
  of King Henry VIII, would be as frightened, and frightened in the same way,
  as if we were put into a ward of unattended criminal lunatics. But the brains
  of these people were no more diseased than ours. Their mental habit systems
  had been built up on a different framework; and that is the whole
  difference.</p>

  <p>It was perfectly sane men who made the World War, who allowed the private
  capitalist system to smash itself to fragments in spite of reiterated
  warnings, and who came near to destroying mankind. If the reader were sent
  back only for the hundred and seventy years between now and 1933, he would
  still feel a decided uneasiness about what people might or might not do next.
  Yet as he fought down his alarm and went about among them he would have found
  them as completely satisfied of the sanity of their own mental shapes as he
  was.</p>

  <p>Presently he would have found himself trying to adapt himself to those
  mental shapes. In the end he might come to realize that, in his own case
  also, it might be that the things he felt compelled to believe and do, and
  the things he found impossible to believe and do, though they had served his
  everyday purposes in his own time fairly well, were no more final in the
  scheme of things than the ideology that framed the motives and acts of a
  Roman emperor or a Sumerian slave.</p>

  <p>The difficulty in the comparison and understanding of past mental states
  with our own increases rather than diminishes as we approach the present,
  because the differences become more subtle and more interwoven with familiar
  phrases and with values we accept. We cannot keep in mind that meanings are
  perpetually being expanded or whittled away. We live to-day so saturated in
  our circumstances, so full of the security, abundance and vitalizing activity
  of our world-commonweal, that it is hard to realize how recently it was
  possible for minds of the highest intelligence to call the most fundamental
  conceptions of our present order in question. Even in the middle Twentieth
  Century, ideas that now seem so natural and necessary to us that we cannot
  imagine them disputed, appeared extravagant, impossible and offensive to
  brains that were in their essential quality just as good as the best alive
  to-day.</p>

  <p>In the early half of the Twentieth Century a great majority of educated
  and intelligent men and women had no faith whatever in the Modern State; they
  hated it, feared it and opposed it, and it is doubtful whether the balance
  was redressed until the Twenty-first Century was well under way. The Modern
  State was built up, by comparatively mediocre men, upon whom the necessary
  group of ideas happened to strike with compelling force. As H. Levy insisted
  in his Universe of Science as early as 1932 (Historical Documents: General
  Ideas Series, 192301), science is a "social venture" rather than an
  accumulation of individual triumphs. Both the scientific idea and the idea of
  the human community were not individual but social products. And the Modern
  State prevailed because its logic steadily conquered not this man in
  particular nor that man in particular, but the sense of fitness in the
  general human intelligence.</p>

  <p>Maxwell Brown, in his monumental studies of the growth of the Modern State
  idea, has made a fairly exhaustive review of the art and literature of the
  early Twentieth Century. Except in the writings of a few such sociologists as
  J. A. Hodson, Harry Elmer Barnes, James Harvey Robinson, C. A. and Mary
  Beard, Raymond B. Fosdick and a few American and English journalists, and in
  such alarmist fantasies as Aldous Huxley's Brave New World, there is no sense
  whatever of the immense revolutionary changes that were occurring in the
  social structure. Bernard Shaw, for example, though classed as a
  revolutionary writer, never, except in his preposterous Back to Methuselah,
  anticipated. The mass of his work was a witty and destructive commentary upon
  contemporary things, ending in that petition in bankruptcy, Too True to be
  Good. He had to a supreme degree the opposition mentality of the Irish.</p>

  <p>This estrangement of literature from the Modern State movement became more
  marked throughout the nineteen twenties and thirties. As reality became
  urgent, as war and insolvency descended upon social life, literature, art and
  criticism recoiled into studies and studios and their own bitter and peculiar
  Bohemia; they became elaborately stylistic and "rare", or brilliantly or
  brutally smutty.</p>

  <p>This decadence of literature, says Maxwell Brown, was an inevitable
  expression of the economic decadence of the Thirties and Forties. He draws an
  illuminating contrast between the type of mind primarily directed towards
  aestheticism and the type of mind primarily directed towards science. The
  "aesthetic producer", he insists, is dominated by acceptance; he writes for
  response. The scientific worker aims at knowledge and is quite indifferent
  whether people like or dislike the knowledge he produces. Aesthetic life
  therefore is conditioned by the times; science conditions the times.</p>

  <p>Literature and art are necessarily time-servers, either abjectly so or
  aggressively and pretentiously so. They deflect real moods or speculate upon
  possible moods in the community. It is no good writing books that people will
  not read or painting pictures from which they merely turn away. Psychology in
  those days had not developed sufficiently to permit of a scientific analysis
  of creative work, and such criticism as there was, when it was not a simple
  release of spite, was essentially an effort either to persuade or to browbeat
  people into buying books and pictures or listening to music of a type fancied
  by the critic. It was more bitterly partisan and propagandist than political
  discussion.</p>

  <p>In the expansive phase of the later nineteenth century the general
  confidence of the prosperous classes was reflected in a large, hopeful,
  forward-looking complacent literature, and every critic was, so to speak, an
  uncle, a prosperous uncle, sitting by the fire, but the sense of contraction
  and advancing dangers that troubled the patrons of art and literature as the
  twentieth century unfolded threw a defensive quality over the intellectual
  world, outside the spheres of science and invention. The progressive note was
  popular no longer. The reading offered to the people was pervaded by a
  nagging hostility to new things, by lamentations for imaginary lost loyalties
  and vanished virtues.</p>

  <p>It was not so much that the writers of the time desired civilization to
  retrace its steps, as that they wished that no more steps should be taken.
  They wanted things to stop&mdash;oh, they wanted them to stop! The underlying
  craving was for consolidation and rest before more was lost. There was little
  coherent system in the objections taken; it was objection at large. Mass
  production was very generally reprehended; science rarely got a good word;
  war&mdash;with modern weapons&mdash;was condemned, though much was to be said
  for the "chivalrous" warfare of the past; there were proposals to "abolish"
  aeroplanes and close all the laboratories in the world; it was assumed that
  hygiene, and especially sexual hygiene, "robbed life of romance"; the decay
  of good manners since the polished days of Hogarth, Sir Charles Grandison and
  Tony Lumpkin was deplored, and the practical disappearance of anything that
  could be called Style. As one nineteenth-century American writer lamented, in
  suitably archaic English:</p>

  <p>"How life hath cheapened, and how blank The Worlde is! like a fen Where
  long ago unstained sank The starrie gentlemen: Since Marston Moor and Newbury
  drank King Charles his gentlemen."</p>

  <p>That was the dominant note.</p>

  <p>Maxwell Brown gives a volume of material, quotations (Literature Hangs
  Back; Historical Documents: General Ideas Series 311002) from about four
  thousand representative books and papers.</p>

  <p>As the world emerged again from the sheer desolation of the Famished
  Fifties and the great pestilence, this purely opposition mentality revived in
  hundreds of thousands of elderly literate people whose brains had been fitted
  and turned round in that way for good. It revived because it was all there
  was to revive in them; and it met with all too ready and natural an
  acceptance among those endless myriads of cleverish active people who were
  now trying to get private businesses and private profit systems going before
  it became too late for ever, between the expanding system&mdash;of the
  Transport Control and its collaterals above, and the inarticulate and still
  needy masses below. They did not realize how much the revival of prosperity
  was due to the new organization. It was not in their type of mind to want to
  account for revivals of prosperity. What they desired to do was to take
  advantage of the "turn of luck". To them from the first the Transport Control
  appeared as a formidable competitor, harsh in spirit and still harsher in
  method, which had set itself to prevent smaller brighter folk making hay
  while the sun shone. They were only too eager to see it as a huge, cheap,
  nasty, vulgar menace to all the jolly little profits and rewards and
  assurances that were peeping up again in life. For the loyalty and obedience
  of servants, it offered them ingenious mechanical arrangements; for the
  labour of respectful toilers, it suggested indifferent and dangerous power
  machinery. Are we not wise and virtuous enough in ourselves, they asked, that
  this World Control should come "tidying us up"?</p>

  <p>Manifestly the new order was resolved to "incorporate" (hateful word!), if
  it could, all these would-be privileged, would-be irresponsible people. Its
  face was hard towards them. Its hygienic and educational activities
  threatened an increasing regulation of their lives. It proposed to rob them
  of the natural excitements and adventure of gambling and speculation; to
  deprive them of the legitimate advantages of their foresight and business
  flair. It threatened them with service; service and ever more service&mdash;a
  rôle, they insisted, that would be unendurably "monotonous". They wanted to
  be good sometimes and bad sometimes and jump from this to that. A "soulless
  uniformity" became the bugbear of these recalcitrant minds.</p>

  <p>The workers often resented Modern State methods almost as much as their
  immediate employers. Men have always been difficult to educate and reluctant
  to submit themselves to discipline, and there was a curious suggestion of the
  schoolmaster about these fellows of the Modern State nuclei. Dislike of what
  was at hand helped to conjure up fears of what might lie beyond. Once freedom
  of business had gone, what rules and regulations might not presently enmesh
  the wilful individual under the thumb of this one world employer? For
  instance, the Modern State centres were talking of a control of population;
  it was easy to see in that a hideous invasion of the most private moments in
  life. Weights and measures and money to-day, and wives and parentage
  tomorrow!</p>

  <p>These widely diffused repugnances, fears and antagonisms were enhanced by
  the difficulties put in the way of aspirants to the Modern State Fellowship
  and to positions of responsibility in the service of the Controls. Jobs were
  not for everyone. Rejected candidates to the Fellowship were among the most
  energetic of Modern State antagonists. By 1970, all over the world, wherever
  the remains of the old prosperous and educated classes of "independent" and
  business people were to be found, appeared associations to combat the
  activities of the Modern State nuclei. There were Liberty Clubs and Free
  Trade Associations; there were Leagues of Citizens, Trade Protection Chambers
  and "Return to Legality" societies. There were organized religious and
  patriotic revivals. The Modern State schools were discovered to be immoral,
  unpatriotic and anti-religious. It was extraordinary how the money-changers
  hurried to the deserted temples and clamoured for the return of Christ.</p>

  <p>Every town and city found someone or other&mdash;as often as not it was
  some elderly lawyer or politician from the old days&mdash;keen to revive and
  protect its privileges. The world heard once more of the rights of peoples
  and nations to be free and sovereign within their borders. A hundred
  different flags fluttered more abundantly every day about the reviving earth
  in the sacred name of freedom. Even men who were engaged in organizing
  debt-serf cultivation and debt-serf industrialism in the American cotton
  districts, in the old rubber plantations and in the factories of India, China
  and South Italy, appeared as generous supporters of and subscribers to the
  sacred cause of individual liberty.</p>

  <p>The behaviour of the inferior masses showed a wide divergence of
  reactions. The widespread communist propaganda of the War Years and the
  Famished Fifties had intensified their natural hostility to the
  profit-seeking bourgeoisie, and there was little chance of their making
  common cause with them; but the Modern State Society, with the lessons of
  Russia before it, had no disposition to exacerbate the class war for its own
  ends. It knew quite clearly that to appeal to the mere insurrectionary
  impulse of the downtrodden was to invite the specialist demagogue, sustained
  by his gang and his heelers, his spies and secret police, to take the chair
  in the council chamber.</p>

  <p>De Windt had driven that point well home. "Creative revolution cannot
  cooperate with insurrectionary revolution." There was to be no flattery of
  ignorance and inferiority as though they were the keys to an instinctive
  wisdom; no incitement to envy and jealousy against knowledge and ability. The
  Modern State meant to abolish toil, and that meant to abolish any toiling
  class, proletariat, labour mass, serf or slave, whatever it was called, but
  it had no intention of flattering and using the oafish mental as well as
  physical limitations it meant to liberate from existence altogether. It took
  the risk that the forces of reaction would organize strikes and mass
  resistance against its regulations, its economies of employment, its
  mechanization, its movements of population and the like, among the other
  inevitable difficulties of its task.</p>

  <p>So the world-stage was set for the triangular drama of the late Twentieth
  and early Twenty-first Centuries, in which reaction in a thousand forms, and
  Modern State organization in one, struggled against each other to subjugate
  or assimilate the more or less passive majority of mankind.</p>

  <p>We write in outline, and necessarily in an elementary history it is only
  the primary lines that can be given. But just as when we enlarge our scale of
  observation, the broad divisions of a map vanish and countries and divisions
  become hills, valleys, buildings, forests, roads, and at last, when we come
  to earth, stones, pebbles, blades of grass and flowers, so this rough
  division of humanity into three intermingled and intensely interacting
  multitudes was in reality qualified by a thousand million individual
  complications.</p>

  <p>On the whole the content of people's minds was far more intricate then
  than it is now. That is a principle the student of history must never forget.
  The intellectual progress of mankind had been a continual disentanglement and
  simplification leading to increased grasp and power. These closing decades of
  the Age of Frustration were still, in comparison with our own time, a time of
  uncertainties, inaccuracies, mixed motives, irrational surprises and bitter
  late realizations. There was scarcely an unskilled toiler in the world who
  was really no more than a passive clod in the hands of his exploiters and
  employers. There was scarcely a reactionary who did not in some fashion want
  tidiness and efficiency. And, conversely, there was hardly a Fellow of the
  Modern State organization, man or woman, who had not spasms of acute self-
  seeking and vanity, who could not be doctrinaire, intolerant and vindictive
  on occasion, who could not be touched by the sentimental and aesthetic values
  of the old order, and who did not like, love and react to scores of people
  incurably shaped to the opposition pattern.</p>

  <p>The New Fiction of the Eighties and Nineties is enormously preoccupied
  with this universal battle of ideas and mental habits in people's minds. The
  simpler novels of the earlier past and the novels of the present day tell of
  individual character in a set battle between good and bad in a world of
  undisputed standards; but the novels of those years of social conflict tell
  of a wild confusion between two sorts of good and two sorts of bad and of
  innate character distorted in a thousand ways. It was a difficult age. Life
  still has its endless ironies and ambiguities, but they are as nothing to
  those amidst which the men of 1970 had to steer their courses.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap3_08"
     name="chap3_08">8. &mdash; THE SECOND CONFERENCE AT BASRA, 1978</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The second Conference at Basra, though many of its prominent
  figures had already played leading rôles in the earlier gathering in 1965,
  was very different in scale, scope and spirit from that assembly. It was an
  older gathering. The average age, says Amen Rihani, was a full ten years
  higher. Young men were still coming into the Fellowship abundantly, but there
  had also been accessions&mdash;and not always very helpful
  accessions&mdash;of older men who had been radical and revolutionary leaders
  in the war period. Their frame of experience had shaped them for
  irresponsible resistance. Their mental disposition was often obstructively
  critical and insubordinate. Many had had no sort of technical experience.
  They were disposed to throw an anarchistic flavour over schools and
  propaganda.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the great scheme of the Modern State had now lost something of
  its first compelling freshness. The "young men of '65" had had ten years of
  responsible administrative work. They had been in contact with urgent detail
  for most of that period. They had had to modify De Windt's generalizations in
  many particulars, and the large splendour of the whole project no longer had
  the same dominating power over their minds. They had lost something of the
  professional esprit de corps, the close intimate confidence with each other,
  with which they had originally embarked upon the great adventure of the
  Modern State. Many had married women of the older social tradition and formed
  new systems of gratification and friendship. They had ceased to be
  enthusiastic young men and they had become men of the world. The consequent
  loss of a sure touch upon primary issues was particularly evident in the
  opening sessions.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the atmosphere of the 1965 gathering had been purely a Modern
  State atmosphere. Except for the Russian political representatives, there had
  been no antagonism at all to its general purposes, and there had been few
  people in Basra who were not Fellows of the Modern State Society or closely
  sympathetic with its aims. But now the reviving nationalisms, the
  resuscitating social and commercial interests of the moribund old world
  system, were acutely aware of the immense significance of events at Basra,
  and there had gathered an assemblage of delegations, reporters, adventurers,
  friends and camp followers of every description, far exceeding the numbers of
  the actual Fellows. They crowded the Control rest houses that clustered about
  the aerodrome, they invaded the offices and residences of the Controls, they
  stimulated the private enterprise hotels and restaurants that had recently
  sprung up among the date palms and rice fields of the environs, to an
  unprecedented congestion and liveliness, and multitudes of them had to be
  accommodated in tents and houseboats. A number of thirty-year-old hulls of
  passenger liners were fitted for their accommodation. Observers were reminded
  of the tourist period of the First Age of General Prosperity when they saw
  these uninvited visitors, chaffering with the old-world Bagdad carpet traders
  and Arab nomads who had also been attracted by the gathering.</p>

  <p>There would probably have been a far greater multitude drawn to Basra if
  the Transport Control had not realized in time the social and hygienic
  dangers of too great a gathering, and had refused passages and limited
  bookings. Casual individuals were eliminated as much as possible, and all
  over the world groups of stranded pilgrims found themselves unable to get
  further on the journey.</p>

  <p>The most serious of these invaders were the delegations of enquiry sent by
  the reawakening sovereign governments of the old order. These were half
  diplomatic, half official-expert, teams, and they came with the declared
  intention of challenging the activities of the Controls in their several
  territories. They proposed to legalize and regulate the Controls. They had no
  formal standing in the Conference; they had invited themselves and given the
  Conference organizers notice of their coming. "Better now than later," said
  the Modern State officials, and accepted notice and provided accommodation.
  "We have to have things out with them," Williams Kapek wrote to Isabel Garden
  (The Kapek Garden Letters. Historical Documents Series: Basra II 9376).</p>

  <p>Beside these "old government" agencies there were a number of parties
  claiming to represent various new business combines and interests that were
  setting up in frank competition with the Control monopolies. There were a
  number of lawyers of the older type, men in sharp contrast and antagonism to
  the younger legists of the new American school. The contrast of the two
  types, the older all pomp and dodges and the younger all candour and science,
  is dwelt upon lengthily by Kapek.</p>

  <p>"This Conference is essentially a conference on Scientific and Mercantile
  Communications and Associated Questions, similar to that held at Basra in
  1965"; so ran a printed notice circulated to all the visitors who could claim
  any representative status. "Its discussions are open only to the Fellows of
  the faculties of the Modern State Society. They are not public discussions
  and their reports are for the use of Fellows only. But it would be
  disingenuous to deny that the decisions arrived at may affect the general
  welfare of mankind profoundly, and since you come to present criticisms,
  claims and proposals presumably in that interest, the committee of
  organization of the Conference will do all it can to facilitate meetings
  between your group and the faculty or faculties affected. Unfortunately the
  accommodation for meetings in Basra will be greatly strained by the needs of
  the actual Conference, and the committee can do little to arrange conferences
  between the immense variety of accredited bodies that have made an
  appearance, much less to arrange for their pleasures and comforts during the
  period of this assembly. The committee regrets that it does not consider the
  proposal of the committee of Bagdad citizens, claiming to represent the
  government of Irak, to police this unexpected World Fair with 300 Arab
  policemen, a camel corps of seventy-nine men and six machine-guns, as a
  practicable one. It has removed this body painlessly to comfortable quarters
  in the Island of Ormuz, and the Police of the Air and Sea Ways in its
  recognizable uniform will be alone responsible for order in the ancient
  province of Bassorah."</p>

  <p>Explicit details of information bureaus, hospital organization, supply and
  available accommodation followed.</p>

  <p>It is difficult to see how else the Central Control could have dealt with
  this unexpectedly abundant eruption of the old system, but the various
  delegations and commissions professed to be extremely indignant at their
  reception. They were of such various and unequal value, that they found it
  impossible to fall into any combined scheme of action. Since their theory was
  that the Controls and the Modern State organization were nothing more than a
  sort of world cooperative society, none of them could behave as diplomatic
  missions to a sovereign power. And consequently they could not regard each
  other as diplomatic missions. Their powers and authorizations were extremely
  ill-defined. The bland refusal of the Conference authorities to concede them
  meeting-places and anything but a very limited use of telephonic, cable and
  radio communications embarrassed them extremely.</p>

  <p>"I met Sir Horatio Porteous, the British Imperial representative, in the
  street," writes Williams Kapek. "He was very eager to get my advice upon a
  point of etiquette. It seems that we have seized the province of Bassorah
  from the government of Irak and made prisoners of an alleged local
  police&mdash;those fifty lousy camels and the rest of it I told you about in
  my last&mdash;and that Irak is a mandatory protectorate under Great Britain.
  He wished to put in a protest somewhere. 'But WHERE?' said he.</p>

  <p>"I adopted a sympathetic tone. 'You see,' said Sir Horatio, 'this Central
  Control of yours isn't any damned thing at all! If it was a provisional
  government or something...'</p>

  <p>"I suggested a call on the Air and Sea Police.</p>

  <p>"'But they are acting under orders. Who gives the orders? It's all so
  damned irregular!...'"</p>

  <p>There was a flutter of calls between the delegations, some "serious talks"
  and much drafting of more or less futile minutes, reports and protests. The
  weather was exceptionally hot and dry and such space and apparatus as was
  available for exercise and recreation was monopolized by the more energetic
  Fellows who were taking part in the Conference proper. It was difficult to
  keep cool, difficult to keep calm; still more difficult to keep well and
  hopeful. Some few of the intrusive delegates and commissioners took to
  drinking hard, but the supply of alcohol was severely limited and the police
  had turned practically all the professional ministers of pleasure out of the
  province. On the other hand, the Transport Control, in a mood of friendly
  indulgence, started a special service of pleasure steamers to Bubiyan,
  outside the jurisdiction of its police, and there a floating little mushroom
  town of cafés, restaurants, houses of pleasure, music halls and shows of
  every sort speedily sprung up to minister to the unofficial overflow of the
  Conference.</p>

  <p>"Bubiyan is draining us quite pleasantly," wrote Williams Kapek, "and they
  say there is quite a boom in entertainment for man and beast in Babylon and
  Bagdad. The old British institution of the long week-end flourishes and
  Babylon gets more and more Babylonian."</p>

  <p>But there were still plenty of outsiders left in Basra to keep the
  faculties busy.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile the Conference was going on behind closed doors. It was clearly
  recognized that this curious mélange of agents, delegates and officials from
  without its organization was only the first intimation of the confused
  antagonisms that were gathering against the new order. The policy of
  expansion and quiet disregard had lasted long enough. The pretence of being a
  Conference upon communications and associated matters had to be dropped. The
  time had come for the Modern State to define itself and clear up its
  relations to the past out of which it had arisen, and to all this world of
  tradition which was now rapping at its doors.</p>

  <p>"Before we disperse," said Arden Essenden, who presided at the first
  plenary session, "we must admit some at least of these delegations, hear them
  and give them answers to take home with them. But first we have to know our
  mind much more clearly. What are we now and what do we intend to do? The days
  before us begin a new chapter in human history. It is for us to choose the
  heading and plan that chapter now."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap3_09"
     name="chap3_09">9. &mdash; "THREE COURSES OF ACTION"</a></h2>

  <p class="first">There was no dominant individual of the De Windt character
  and quality at the second Basra Conference. There was no prophetic direction
  of the deliberations. But there was no want of what used to be called
  "leadership", and a number of interesting personalities, the politic Hooper
  Hamilton; the frank, emphatic William Ryan; the intricate Shi-lung-tang;
  M'bangoi, the East African biologist; Rin Kay, the social
  psychologist&mdash;perhaps the finest mind in the gathering; Mohini L.
  Tagore; Morowitz, the mystical humanist; and Arden Essenden, the fanatic of
  action, gave point and definition to the differences of opinion.</p>

  <p>They were interesting rather than outstanding men because the general
  level of intelligence was a high one. The gathering had a personality of its
  own, wary, resolved to be well informed and to weigh considerations, but
  essentially determined. The presence of that miscellany of delegations and
  commissions which besieged the Conference dramatized the world situation and
  pressed for decisions. "I feel like one of those old world jurymen," wrote
  Williams Kapek, "who used to be locked up together until they returned a
  verdict. And you cannot imagine how hot and dry Basra can sometimes contrive
  to be."</p>

  <p>De Windt and his school of writers had planned the framework of a new
  world and shown to what social elements one had to look for its evocation,
  but he had given only the most scanty suggestions for getting rid of the body
  of the old. Already in 1965 the Modern State people had had a fairly distinct
  vision of our present order. But few of them had anticipated the diffused
  toughness of the old corpus and its capacity for counter-revolutionary
  exertion. That had become oppressively evident by 1975.</p>

  <p>Reports on the general situation had been very carefully prepared. They
  dealt with the various centres at which the spirit of opposition was being
  organized. Most serious of these were those former sovereign governments and
  legal systems, which had seemed effaced, moribund or prostrate during the
  desolation of the Famished and Fever-stricken Fifties. In 1965 the only
  government actively antagonistic to the Controls had been the Soviet
  government in Russia. That antagonism, curiously enough, was not so great as
  it had been at first. The technicians of the sovietized regions were ousting
  the politicians; there was now indeed a working cooperation of Russian
  transport, communications and production with the world system under the
  Controls, and there seemed a reasonable prospect of ultimate assimilation.
  There was no objection being made to people nominally communists who were
  also Fellows of the Modern State, and many Russian scientific and technical
  workers were Modern State Fellows and not members of the communist party at
  all. The reports discussed hopefully and analytically the possibility of some
  similar process in America and the Far East. There also the political and
  legal structures did not present insurmountable obstacles to assimilation.
  The decline of humbug in America was bringing out the fundamental
  constructive energy of that great synthesis of Western peoples. But elsewhere
  there was increasing evidence that the sovereign state system and the system
  of private ownership were fundamentally irreconcilable with the new
  conceptions.</p>

  <p>The reports gave information, that was in many particulars new to most of
  the assembled Fellows, of the very strenuous attempts that were being made by
  the reviving national governments in Germany, France, Italy and Great Britain
  to resume the manufacture of aeroplanes and war material. Whether there was a
  common agreement among them was doubtful, but the intention to put up air
  forces and organize aerodromes that should be able to ignore the regulations
  and refuse the services of the Air and Sea Control was quite plain. They were
  finding great difficulty in securing the services of competent engineers,
  mechanics and aviators, but the thing was going on. Every student in the
  technical schools of the Control who failed a test or an examination, or was
  penalized for misbehaviour or rejected from the Modern State Fellowship,
  would turn up presently as a national government expert. And the governments
  were now setting up their own national technical schools and attempting to
  bring the schools and laboratories of the Control into the "national"
  educational organization. Not only was there a disposition to set up a
  competing system side by side with the Controls system, but there was a
  growing tendency to annex the organizations, roads, plant, mines, factories,
  aerodromes, schools, colleges, laboratories and personnel of the Control that
  chanced to be within the jurisdiction of the sovereign government concerned.
  The new Bavarian government, the Windsor Parliament and the government in
  Rome were all "arranging to take over" these things within their territories.
  They were becoming more explicit about it every year. They persisted in
  regarding the interlocking Controls as a dangerous international Trust.</p>

  <p>This was the burthen of the national missions of observation and enquiry
  which were stewing in the sunshine outside the doors of the
  Conference&mdash;"in a state of tentative menace", as Williams Kapek put
  it.</p>

  <p>The minor delegations representing groups of owners and organized local
  interests had this much in common with the national missions, that they
  proposed more or less frankly to resume possession of properties the Controls
  had taken hold of and revived, or to impose burthensome charges. They varied
  like the inmates of a zoological garden in scale and power, but they had one
  quality in common: an obstructive litigiousness.</p>

  <p>In the frankness of its privacy behind its closed doors, the Conference
  sized up these antagonisms and discussed their treatment. "There are just
  three lines of treatment possible," said Ryan brutally. "We can treat with
  'em, bribe 'em, or rule 'em. I'm for a straight rule."</p>

  <p>"Or combine those ingredients," said Hooper Hamilton.</p>

  <p>The method of treaty-making and a modus vivendi was already in operation
  in regard to Russia. There indeed it was hard to say whether the communist
  party or the Modern State movement was in control, so far had assimilation
  gone. And the new spirit in the old United States was now so "Modern", that
  the protests of Washington and of various state governors against the
  Controls were received hilariously. Aeroplanes from Dearborn circled over the
  capital and White House and dropped parodies of the President's instructions
  to dissolve the Air and Food Trust of America. All over that realist
  continent, indeed, the Controls expanded as a self-owned business with a
  complete disregard of political formalities. But the European situation was
  more perplexing.</p>

  <p>"Most of these European sovereign governments are no more than
  scarecrows," said William Ryan. "There's no living people behind them any
  longer. Leastway, no living people that matter. Call their bluff on them and
  you'll hear no more about them."</p>

  <p>It was Shi-lung-tang who argued against defiance and stated the case for
  Bribery.</p>

  <p>Bribery in his suave exposition, bribery combined with treaties and tact,
  became a highly moral amelioration of direct action. He asked the Conference
  to realize how specialized and rare as yet was its new forward-looking habit
  of mind. When all the work of the propaganda and schools had been accounted
  for, it was doubtful if a twentieth part of the race accepted, or if a tenth
  understood, even in the most general terms, the difference between minds
  trained to creative conceptions and minds brought up in an atmosphere of
  defensive acquisitiveness and property accumulation. It would take three or
  four generations to convert the world to a forward-looking attitude. Either
  the Modern State movement had to seize power openly now and inaugurate a
  tyranny that would have to last as long as it took to turn round the great
  majority of intelligences into the new direction, or it had to propitiate,
  compromise and persuade these outer masses&mdash;UPON THEIR OWN LINES.</p>

  <p>"These people will never see things as we see them," he insisted, making
  strange gestures and repeating his words to emphasize their importance. "They
  have to live and die, ON THEIR OWN LINES. It is not just to impose too much
  upon them. It is only as they die out that the Modern State form of mind can
  hope to be in a dominant majority. Their mental vices are incurable. Meet
  them half way, make things easy for them. You will save the world three
  generations of suffering and bitter conflict."</p>

  <p>He unfolded his Machiavellian project. A greedy acquisitiveness was part
  of the make-up of every energetic old world-type. They were as incurably
  voracious as dogs. And yet we made good friends and helpers out of dogs.
  Their loyalties were at best gang loyalties; they were none the less greedy
  because they did at times hunt in packs. But they had no fundamental
  instinctive hostility to the Modern State. It was only when the Modern State
  thwarted their established habits of behaviour that they snarled at it and
  began to fear it. They could never make a solid front against the Modern
  State. They could always be played off against each other, one against
  another; they could be neutralized. The lesson of Russia's harsh repression
  of her bourgeoisie and professional classes in the Twenties and Thirties was
  a warning against the miseries and social damage of too sudden and forcible
  an attempt to change ideals of behaviour. Let the Modern State go more softly
  and more kindly.</p>

  <p>He went on to detailed suggestions. With Russia, Spain and America,
  bribery need play but a minor rôle. The ruling mentality in these countries
  was now such that the present working agreements would pass naturally into
  assimilation in a little while. Elsewhere there was really no permanent harm
  in recognizing the old claims to sovereign and proprietary rights, and
  securing such a hold upon leading men that they would keep their hands off
  the Modern State propaganda and schools and be content with handsome
  subsidies from the Control services and industries. It would be cheaper than
  war. "If they want a little war now and then among themselves&mdash;"</p>

  <p>In spite of Shi-lung-tang's smiling face, there was audible disapproval at
  this point.</p>

  <p>When he had done, his case for tact and insinuating corruption was knocked
  to pieces by Rin Kay. "If we were a Society of Moral Supermen," he said, "we
  might venture to be as disingenuous as this." But Mr. Shi-lung-tang forgot
  that every Fellow in the Modern State society had two enemies: the
  acquisitive man outside and the acquisitive man within. The point their
  Chinese friend missed was the fact that it was much more natural to adopt the
  behaviour patterns of the old world than to acquire those of the Modern
  State. The old dispositions were something that was; the new dispositions
  were something that had to be made and sustained. The inner life of a Modern
  State Fellow was a sustained effort to be simple and serve simply. That
  should take him all his time. He could not afford to be intricate and
  politic. "We have a difficult enough task before us just to do what we have
  to do, plainly and honestly. We cannot afford to say and do THIS and mean
  THAT." William Ryan supported that with vigour, but Hooper Hamilton spoke
  long and elaborately on the other side. The spirit of the society was plainly
  with Kay.</p>

  <p>M. L. Tagore, an economic botanist, introduced a new line of thought into
  the discussion, or rather he revived the line of thought of
  nineteenth-century mystical liberalism. He said he was equally against
  bribery, insincere treaties or any use of force. He was old-fashioned enough
  to be a democrat and a believer in the innate wisdom of the unsophisticated
  man. And also he believed in the supreme value of truth and inaggressiveness.
  We must not outrage the sense of right in man, even if that meant the
  abandonment of our immediate objectives. We had to persuade him. And we had
  no right to assume that he did not hold himself to be right because his
  conception of conduct differed from ours. Let the Modern State society go on
  with the scientific organization of the world, yes, and let us go on with the
  propaganda of its doctrines in every land. But let it not lift a hand to
  compel, not even to resist evil. He appealed to the missionary successes of
  early Buddhism and Christianity as evidence of the practical successfulness
  of spiritual urgency and physical passivity. He concluded in a glow of
  religious enthusiasm, that did not spare him the contemptuous criticisms of
  the social psychologists who fell upon him tooth and nail so soon as he had
  done.</p>

  <p>These speeches, which are to be found in full in the Basra Conference
  Reports, vols. 371 and 372, were the three salient types of opinion in that
  gathering. The immense majority were for the active line, for frankness and
  rule. A not inconsiderable minority, however, wavered behind the leadership
  of Hooper Hamilton. They felt that there were elaborations and refinements
  that did not find expression in the more aggressive speeches, that the use of
  force could be tempered by tact and that lucidity towards an objective was
  compatible with kindliness and concession.</p>

  <p>In a number of speeches some of them tried to express this rather elusive
  conception of compromise; some of them were not too skilful as speakers, they
  went too far in the opposite direction, and on the whole they tended to drive
  the movement towards a harder assertiveness than it might otherwise have
  expressed. The problems of the Russian system and America were abundantly
  discussed. Russia now was represented only by technicians and there was
  abundant evidence that the repressive influence of the Og-pu had waned. Ivan
  Englehart was again a leading figure. He assured the Conference that there
  would be no trouble from Moscow. "Russia," he said, "is ready to assimilate.
  Is eager to assimilate."</p>

  <p>Arden Essenden spoke late in the general discussion; he spoke with a harsh
  enthusiasm and passionate faith; he carried all the younger men and most of
  the older ones with him and he shaped the ultimate decisions.</p>

  <p>Some of his phrases are, as people used to say, "historical". He said,
  "The World-State is not a thing of the Future. It is here and now. It has
  always been here and now, since ever men said they had a common God above
  them, or talked, however timidly, of the brotherhood of mankind. The man who
  serves a particular state or a particular ownership in despite of the human
  commonweal is a Traitor. Men who did that have always been Traitors and men
  who tolerated them nursed treason in their hearts. In the past the
  World-State had been torn up among three-score-and-ten anarchies and a
  countless myriad of proprietors and creditors, and the socialists and
  cosmopolitans, the true heirs of the race, were hunted like criminals and
  persecuted and killed.</p>

  <p>"Now, through the utter failure of those robbers even to maintain their
  own social order and keep at peace among themselves, the world has fallen
  into our hands. Power has deserted them, and we, we here, have Power. If we
  do not use it, if we do not use it to the fullest, we are traitors in our
  turn. Are we to tolerate even a temporary revival of the old system? In the
  name of reason, why? If their brains have got into the wrong
  grooves&mdash;well, we can make fresh brains. Are we to connive with, and
  indulge this riffraff that waits outside our doors? Go out and look at them.
  Look at their insincere faces! Look at their furtive hands. Weigh what they
  say. Weigh the offers they will make you!"</p>

  <p>To us to-day that seems platitudinous and over emphatic, but it conveyed
  the sense of the Conference and it led directly to the general decision with
  which its proceedings concluded. The most significant of these was the
  increase of the Police of the Air and Sea Ways to a million men, and the
  apportionment of a greatly increased amount of energy to the improvement of
  their equipment. There was also to be a great intensification and speeding up
  of Modern State education and propaganda. Provision was also made for the
  enlistment of auxiliary forces and services as they might be needed for the
  preservation of order; these auxiliaries were to renounce any allegiance
  except to the Transport or other Control that might enlist them. The Controls
  were reorganized, and a central committee, which speedily became known as the
  World Council, was appointed by them to act as the speaking head of the whole
  system. The ideas of treaties and contracts with exterior administrations and
  of any diplomatic dealings with dissentients were abandoned. Instead it was
  determined that this central committee, the World Council, should openly
  declare itself the sole government of the world and proceed to make the
  associated Controls the administrative organization of the planet.</p>

  <p>Accordingly a proclamation was prepared to this effect and issued very
  widely. It was broadcast as well as printed and reprinted from a multitude of
  centres. It was "put upon the ether" everywhere to the exclusion of other
  matter. For now the world had its wireless again in as great abundance
  already as in the early Thirties. So simultaneously the whole planet received
  it. It whipped up the awaiting miscellany at Basra into a foam of excited
  enquiry. All over the world city crowds or solitary workers received it,
  open-mouthed. At first there was very little discussion. The effect was too
  stunning for that. People began to talk after a day or so.</p>

  <p>We give it as it was issued: a singularly poor piece of prose when we
  consider the magnificence of its matter. It seems to have been drafted by
  Arden Essenden, with some assistance from Hamilton and amended in a few
  particulars by the Council.</p>

  <p>"The Council for World Affairs, constituted by the Air and Sea Control and
  its associates, declares:</p>

  <p>"That between 1950 and 1965 this planet became derelict through the
  incapacity of its ostensible rulers and property owners to keep the peace,
  regulate production and distribution, and conserve and guide the common life
  of mankind;</p>

  <p>"That chaos ensued, and</p>

  <p>"That it became urgently necessary to build up a new world administration
  amidst the ruins.</p>

  <p>"This the Air and Sea Control did.</p>

  <p>"This administration has now been organized about a Central Council for
  World Affairs, which is making this statement to you.</p>

  <p>"It is the only sovereign upon this planet. There is now no other primary
  authority from end to end of the earth. All other sovereignty and all
  proprietary rights whatever that do not conduce directly to the general
  welfare of mankind ceased to exist during the period of disorder, and cannot
  be revived.</p>

  <p>"The Council has its air and sea ways, its airports, dockyards, factories,
  mines, plantations, laboratories, colleges and schools throughout the world.
  These are administered by its officials and protected by its own police, and
  the latter are instructed to defend these organizations whenever and wherever
  it may be necessary against the aggression of unauthorized persons.</p>

  <p>"In every centre of population there are now Modern State nuclei and
  Control agents conducting the educational work of the Council and in
  reasonable contact with the local economic life, with local enterprises,
  local authorities and individuals not yet affiliated to the Modern State
  organization. The time has come for all these various quasi independent
  organs of business and administration to place themselves in orderly
  relations to the new Government of the Whole World.</p>

  <p>"We are constituting a Bureau of Transition, for the simplification and
  modernization of the business activities, the educational and hygienic
  services, production, distribution and the preservation of order and security
  throughout our one home and garden, our pleasure ground and the source of all
  our riches&mdash;the earth, our Mother Earth, our earth and yours.</p>

  <p>"Without haste or injustice and without delay, with a due regard to your
  comfort, your welfare and your wishes, the Bureau will set itself to bring
  your life into sound and permanent correlation with the one human
  commonweal."</p>

  <p>"It is usurpation!" cried a voice, when the declaration was put to the
  vote as a whole.</p>

  <p>"You decide upon Force," said Shi-lung-tang. "I did my best&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But this means War!" cried Tagore.</p>

  <p>"No," said Arden Essenden. "There is no more War. This is not
  War&mdash;nor Revolution. This is the recognition of a Revolution and
  Government again."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap3_10"
     name="chap3_10">10. &mdash; THE LIFE-TIME PLAN</a></h2>

  <p class="first">It is still a debatable question how far that hard decisive
  declaration of the Socialist World-State at Basra was not premature. There
  are those who consider it the most timely of acts; there are some who believe
  it should have been made as early as the first Conference in 1965. The
  discussion became involved with the intellectual and moral conflicts that
  went on under the Air Dictatorship. It mingles with the controversies of
  to-day. But certainly, from 1978 onward, the Modern State movement lost
  something of its pristine mental freshness, lost openness, lost much of that
  almost irresponsible adventurousness that had flung the network of transport
  and trading controls so swiftly about the earth. "We have swallowed the
  world, but now we have to digest it," said Arden Essenden. The old defiant
  repudiation of the past was replaced by a firm and sometimes rather heavy
  insistence upon the order of the future.</p>

  <p>There was nowhere any immediate uprising in response to the proclamation
  of a World Government. Although it had been plainly coming for some years,
  although it had been endlessly feared and murmured against, it found no
  opposition prepared anywhere. Thirteen years had wrought a profound change in
  Soviet Russia and the large areas of China in association with Moscow. The
  practical assimilation of Soviet Transport and Communications was almost
  tacitly accepted. The details of the amalgamation were entrusted to
  committees flying between Moscow and Basra. All over the world, wherever
  there was any sort of governing or managing body not already associated with
  the Modern State System, it fell to debating just how and to what extent it
  could be incorporated or how it could resist incorporation. Everywhere there
  were Modern State nuclei ready to come into conference and fully informed
  upon local or regional issues. The plain necessity for a systematic
  "renucleation" of the world became evident. The "Section of Training and
  Advertisement" had long since worked out the broad lines of a modus vivendi
  between the old and the new.</p>

  <p>That modus vivendi is called variously The Life Time Plan or&mdash;with a
  memory of that pioneer effort in planning, The Five Year Plan of the Russian
  Dictatorship&mdash;The Thirty Year Plan. Independent businesses that
  respected certain standards of treatment by the workers, which would accept a
  certain amount of exterior control, technical and financial, and which
  maintained a certain standard of efficiency, were to be accorded not simply
  tolerance but a reasonable protection. Even if their methods were suddenly
  superseded by new devices, they were to be kept running until they could be
  wound up, their products were still to be taken by the Controls. This was far
  better treatment than was ever accorded superseded producers under the
  smash-and-grab conditions of the competitive system. In the same way,
  whenever possible the small owning peasant or the agricultural tenant was not
  dispossessed; he was given a fixed price for his output, counselled or
  directed in the matter of improvements and so merged by bearable degrees into
  the class of agricultural workers. This, as Rupert Bordinesco put it (Brief
  Explanation: Historical Documents Series 1969), gave them "time to die out".
  Because it was an integral part of the Life Time Plan that the new generation
  should be educated to develop a service mentality in the place of a
  proprietary mentality. There were to be no independent merchants or
  independent cultivators under twenty in 1980, none under thirty in 1990 and
  none under forty in 2000. This not only gave the old order time to die out;
  it gave the new order time to develop the more complex system of direction,
  mechanism and delivery it needed soundly and healthily. The lesson of the
  mental discords and tragic disproportions in the headlong development of the
  first Russian Five Year Plan&mdash;disproportions as monstrous and
  distressful as the hypertrophies and atrophies of the planless "Capitalist
  System" of the nineteenth century&mdash;had been marked and learnt.</p>

  <p>It did not trouble the World Council that to retain millions of small
  businesses and tens of millions of small cultivators the whole world over for
  so long meant a much lower efficiency of production. "These older people have
  to be fed and employed," wrote Bordinesco, "and now they will never learn or
  be able to adapt themselves to a novel routine of life. Help them to do their
  job a little better. Save them from the smart people who want to prey upon
  them&mdash; usurers, mortgagers, instalment salesmen, intimidators, religious
  or secular; and for the rest&mdash;leave them in peace."</p>

  <p>The Brief Explanation also drew a moral from the "Period of Glut" in the
  Twenties, which preceded the collapse of the Thirties, when the whole world
  was full of unconsumed goods and unemployed people. This, Bordinesco pointed
  out, was the inevitable consequence of an unregulated progressive system of
  private enterprise. "There is no sense in throwing a man out of an
  employment, however old-fashioned, unless there is a new job for him. There
  is no sense in bringing children into the world unless there is education,
  training and useful work for them to do. We have to see that each new
  generation is arranged numerically in different categories of training and
  objective from those of its predecessor. The Russians learnt this necessity
  in their great experiment. As we progress towards a scientific production of
  primary substances, the actual proportion of agricultural workers, miners,
  forest wardens, fishermen and so forth in the community must fall. So also
  the proportion of ordinary industrial workers must fall. The heavy industries
  will precede the light in that. A certain compensation will be caused by a
  steady rise in the standard of living and particularly by what De Windt
  called 'the rebuilding of the world', new cities, new roads, continually
  renewed houses everywhere." (This was foreshadowed to a certain extent by the
  French plan for "Outillage National" and the German housing schemes in
  operation as early as the late Twenties, plans and schemes ultimately
  strangled by the budget-balancing fanatics.) But even that diversion of
  energy from the production of basic materials and small commodities to big
  structural undertakings would not suffice to use up the continually released
  human power in the community. At this point appeared what Bordinesco called
  the "enlarging categories", which were to consume more than they gave. There
  had to be increasing numbers of people engaged in education, in the
  developing and ordering of knowledge, in experimental science, in artistic
  production, in making life more abundant and ample. To that expansion no
  limit could be set.</p>

  <p>"We men have a lease of this planet," runs the Brief Explanation, "for
  some millions of years. It is foolish not to press on to better life, but it
  is more foolish to hurry frantically and cruelly. The history of the past two
  centuries is one sustained warning against the disemployment of men and women
  for whom there is no other use. Before we teach, our teachers have to learn;
  before we direct comprehensively, we must have experience in direction. We
  must always be attempting a little more than we can do, but we must not be
  attempting the impossible. We must advance without needless delay, but
  without waste, hurry, or cruelty. Do not be fearful or jealous of the advent
  of the new conditions. No honest worker, man or woman, has anything to fear
  from the coming of the Modern State."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap3_11"
     name="chap3_11">11. &mdash; THE REAL STRUGGLE FOR GOVERNMENT
     BEGINS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">But the rulers of the new World-State, as their enlargements
  of the Air and Sea Police made manifest, were under no illusion that the new
  order could be established in the world by declarations and "Brief
  Explanations", and hard upon its proposals for conferences and assimilations
  came the organization of its local constabularies and the regulations that
  made the reorganized nuclei the sole means of communication of independent
  local authorities, businesses and individuals with the central Controls. In
  nearly every part of the earth the nuclei had prepared a personnel of
  sympathizers and auxiliaries, varying in character with local conditions,
  outside the ranks of the Fellowship. The khaki uniform of the street and road
  guardians, differing very little then from the one familiar to us to-day,
  appeared as if by magic all over the world, and the symbol of the winged disc
  broke out upon aeroplanes, post offices, telephone and telegraph booths, road
  signs, transport vehicles and public buildings. There was still no discord
  with Russia; there the blazon of the wings was put up side by side with the
  old hammer and sickle.</p>

  <p>Nowhere at first was there any armed insurrectionary movement. We realize
  from this how complete had been the collapse of the organized patriotic
  states of the World War period. They had no national newspapers, no
  diplomats, no Foreign Offices any more. There had been no paper for the
  former and there had been no salaries for the latter. Lacking vocal organs,
  nationalism as such was silenced. There were, however, protests, in a
  considerable variety of ineffectiveness, from local self-appointed bodies,
  and much passive resistance and failure to comply. But even the removal of
  the winged sign was infrequent, and usually where that occurred nothing
  further ensued when the air police came whirring out of the sky to replace
  it.</p>

  <p>This phase of tacit acquiescence was, however, only temporary, until the
  opposition could gather itself into new forms and phases and discover methods
  of organization. The elements of antagonism were abundant enough. The Fascist
  garrison in Rome, claiming to be the government of all Italy, was one of the
  earliest to make its challenge. It had a number of airmen, unlicensed for
  various reasons by the Transport Control, and it now sent a detachment of its
  Black Shirts to occupy the new aeroplane factory outside the old Roman town
  of Turin, and to seize a small aerodrome and whatever air material was to be
  found in it at Ostia. The winged disc at these two places was replaced by the
  national fasces. A proclamation was made and disseminated as widely as the
  restricted means of publication permitted, calling for an assembly of the old
  League of Nations and reviving a long defunct phrase of President Wilson's,
  "the self-determination of peoples." The King of Italy, after a diligent
  search, was found inoffensively farming in Piedmont, and the long closed
  palace of the Quirinal was reopened and made habitable for him.</p>

  <p>The new air police had been waiting with a certain impatience for
  provocation of this sort. It had been equipped with a new type of gas bomb
  releasing a gas called Pacificin, which rendered the victim insensible for
  about thirty-six hours and was said to have no further detrimental effect.
  With this it now proceeded to "treat" the long resented customs house at
  Ventimiglia and the factory and aerodrome in dispute.</p>

  <p>At Ostia the police planes found a complication of the situation.</p>

  <p>An extraordinary ceremony was in progress in the aerodrome. Three new
  aeroplanes had just been brought thither from the Turin factory, and they
  were being blessed by the Pope (Pope Alban III).</p>

  <p>For the still vital Catholic Church had always been given to the blessing
  of implements, shops, boats, bridges, automobiles, flags, guns, battleships,
  new buildings and the like. It was a ceremony that advertised the Church,
  gratified the faithful, and did no perceptible harm to the objects blessed.
  And this particular occasion had been made something of a demonstration
  against the World Council. The Pope had come; the King and the reigning Duce
  were present. Sound films made only a few minutes before the arrival of the
  air police show a gathering as brilliant, with its uniforms and canonicals,
  as anything that might have occurred before the World War. Choristers in
  cassocks and charming little lace collars chant, acolytes swing censers; the
  venerable Holy Father sits on a throne under a canopy, on a large
  crimson-draped platform. There was a muster of at least three thousand Black
  Shirts.</p>

  <p>The action of the Council commander, Luigi Roselli, was precipitate.</p>

  <p>The subsequent enquiry intimates pretty clearly that he betrayed anti-
  clerical bias. He had been chosen for this task because he was himself an
  Italian, and so, it was thought, less likely to exacerbate any latent
  nationalist feeling. (It is an interesting sidelight on the times that the
  Fascist commandatore on the ground was Mario Roselli, his elder
  half-brother.) His general instructions had been to seize the aerodrome and
  the aeroplanes with as little violence as possible. The Pacificin was only to
  be used in case of armed resistance. But the sight of the cassocks, the
  birettas, the canopies and ornaments and robes, the sound of chanting and the
  general ecclesiastical atmosphere were too much for the young man's
  prejudices. His squadron circled in formation over the aerodrome. The
  ceremony proceeded with dignity in spite of the noise of his propellers. For
  it seemed incredible that any human being would dare to gas the Pope.</p>

  <p>"Let go," said Luigi Roselli, too malicious to realize the brutality of
  his outrage.</p>

  <p>The gas containers came crashing into the arena.</p>

  <p>"Just for a moment," says one of the aviators concerned, in a memorable
  letter, "the chanting rose louder. They showed pluck, those priests. Hardly
  one of them broke ranks. Then they crumpled up in their places, drifting down
  on their knees for the most part. It was queer the way you saw the gas
  spreading among them; it was like a bed of flowers dying and the death
  spreading out from a lot of centres. The old boy on the throne didn't turn a
  hair. He had his hands together and his head bowed. You couldn't tell when it
  took him. The Fascist guard and the King's party weren't anything like so
  dignified. They gesticulated, they yelled. They were defiant and all that.
  And some ran about a bit before the stuff got them.</p>

  <p>"Of course, you must understand, the whole lot thought they were being
  killed. None of them could have known anything of this new stuff. WE didn't
  know until a fortnight ago.</p>

  <p>"We had no gas masks on our bird, so I didn't take part in the landing
  party which seized the new 'planes.</p>

  <p>"The last I saw of that aerodrome, it looked like some old Turkish carpet,
  gone threadbare in places but still with some brightish patches. Perfect
  garden of sleep. I hope nobody robbed any of them before they came to. But
  Roselli, I believe, dropped proper instructions about it all in Rome...."</p>

  <p>Unhappily the raid had not been so completely bloodless as this young man
  supposed. A youthful priest, Odet Buanarotti, had been struck on the head by
  one of the glass containers and killed outright. He was subsequently
  canonized; the last saint and martyr to be inscribed in the Latin
  hagiography....</p>

  <p>At this point Raven's written transcript breaks off abruptly.</p><br>

  <h2><a id="book4"
     name="book4">BOOK THE FOURTH<br>
  THE MODERN STATE MILITANT</a></h2>

  <h2><a id="chap4_01"
     name="chap4_01">1. &mdash; GAP IN THE TEXT</a></h2>

  <p class="first">So far I have been transcribing, with very little correction
  and no alteration, the text of Raven's dream book as he left it fully written
  out. But at this point, that fully written out history breaks off. The record
  of the next seventy or eighty years is represented only by an untidy mass of
  notes in the perfectly abominable private shorthand Raven used. Then comes
  the concluding chapter fully written out again.</p>

  <p>I cannot say with any certainty why Raven left this very vital part of his
  story obscure and confused while he went on to the very last part of all. But
  I have my own ideas of what happened in his brain. In the first place he had
  a very human impulse to realize the issue of this world revolution that was
  unfolding in these notes, and it was easier, therefore, because it was more
  attractive, for him to write out the later part first. And in the next the
  intervening matter was really much more intricate for him to handle. It had,
  if I may use the expression, "come through his mind" with difficulty and
  against resistances. His general ideas had been prepared for the new wars,
  for the post-war breakdown and for a world rule based on air power, and they
  had also been prepared for the steadily progressive World-State of the final
  phase. But they had not been prepared for the profound and complex mental and
  spiritual struggles of three-quarters of a century which inaugurated the new
  order. Those he had not thought out.</p>

  <p>Whether it was really a clairvoyant vision he had of a real future text
  book of history, or whether all this matter was an eruption from his
  subconscious mind, hardly affects the manifest fact that all this part came
  against the grain. One of the strongest arguments for the view that this
  Outline of the Future was evolved by Raven from his inner consciousness is
  the fact that there are several passages in which he seems to argue with
  himself, and that the quiet unhurrying assurance of the earlier and later
  narratives is not sustained in these middle parts.</p>

  <p>I do not think it was mere chance that pulled him up precisely at the
  point when he came to the gassing of the Pope and the martyrdom of Saint Odet
  of Ostia. I think that this incident struck him as cardinal, as marking a
  supremely significant corner which humanity was turning. It was something
  that had to happen and it was something he had never let his mind dwell upon.
  It ended a practical truce that had endured for nearly three centuries in the
  matter of moral teaching, in the organization of motive, in what was then
  understood as religion. It was the first killing in a new religious conflict.
  The new government meant to rule not only the planet but the human will. One
  thing meant the other. It had realized that to its own surprise. And Raven,
  with an equal surprise, had realized that so it had to be.</p>

  <p>Nearly a year earlier the One World-State had been declared at Basra.
  There already it had been asserted plainly that a new order must insist upon
  its own specific education, and that it could not tolerate any other forms of
  training for the world-wide lives it contemplated. But to say a thing like
  that is not to realize its meaning. Things of that sort had been said before,
  and passed like musical flourishes across the minds of men. The new
  government did not apprehend the fullness of its own intentions until this
  unpremeditated act of supreme sacrilege forced decision upon it. But now it
  had struck down the very head of Catholic Christianity and killed an
  officiating priest in the midst of his ministrations. It had gripped that
  vast world organization, the Catholic Church, and told it in effect to be
  still for evermore. It was now awake to its own purpose. It might have
  retreated or compromised. It decided to go on.</p>

  <p>Ten days later air guards descended upon Mecca and closed the chief holy
  places. A number of religious observances were suppressed in India, and the
  slaughter-houses in which kosher food was prepared in an antiquated and
  unpleasant manner for orthodox Jews were closed throughout the world. An Act
  of Uniformity came into operation everywhere. There was now to be one faith
  only in the world, the moral expression of the one world community.</p>

  <p>Raven was taken unawares, as the world of 1978 was taken unawares, by this
  swift unfolding of a transport monopoly into a government, a social order and
  a universal faith. And yet the experiment of Soviet Russia and the practical
  suppression of any other religion than the so-called communism that had been
  forced upon it might well have prepared his mind for the realization that for
  any new social order there must be a new education of all who were to live
  willingly and helpfully in it, and that the core of an education is a
  religion. Plainly he had not thought out all that such a statement means.
  Like almost all the liberal-minded people of our time, he had disbelieved in
  every form of contemporary religion, and he had tolerated them all. It had
  seemed to him entirely reasonable that minds could be left to take the mould
  of any pattern and interpretation of life that chanced upon them without any
  serious effect upon their social and political reactions. It is extraordinary
  how such contradictory conceptions of living still exist side by side in our
  present world with only a little mutual nagging. But very evidently that is
  not going to be accepted by the generations that are coming. They are going
  to realize that there can be only one right way of looking at the world for a
  normal human being and only one conception of a proper scheme of social
  reactions, and that all others must be wrong and misleading and involve
  destructive distortions of conduct.</p>

  <p>Raven's dream book, as it unfolded the history of the last great
  revolution in human affairs to him, shattered all the evasive optimism, all
  the kindly disastrous toleration and good fellowship of our time, in his
  mind. If there was to be peace on earth and any further welfare for mankind,
  if there was to be an end to wars, plunderings, poverty and bitter universal
  frustration, not only the collective organization of the race but the moral
  making of the individual had to begin anew. The formal revolution that had
  taken place was only the prelude to the real revolution; it provided only the
  frame, the Provisional Government, within which the essential thing, mental
  reconstruction, had now to begin.</p>

  <p>That precarious first world government with its few millions of
  imperfectly assimilated adherents, which now clutched the earth, had to
  immobilize or destroy every facile system of errors, misinterpretations,
  compensations and self-consolations that still survived to confuse the minds
  of men; it had to fight a battle against fear, indolence, greed and jealousy
  in every soul in the world, the souls of its own people most of all, and win.
  Or it had to lapse. It had to do that within a definite time. If it did not
  win within that time, then dissension and relapse were inevitable and one
  more century of blundering and futility would have to be added to the long
  record of man's martyrdom. This new régime had to clean up the racial mind or
  fail, and if it failed then in all probability it would leave the race to
  drift back again to animal individualism, and so through chaos to extinction.
  Failures in the past had been possible without general disaster, because they
  were partial and local, but this was the decisive world effort.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap4_02"
     name="chap4_02">2. &mdash; MELODRAMATIC INTERLUDE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">I have remarked already how impersonal is this school
  history of the year 2006 in comparison with the histories of our own time.
  Politicians and statesmen pass like the shadows of general forces, royalties
  peep and vanish like mice behind the wainscot. They vanish at last
  altogether&mdash;unobtrusively. Now and then this history picks out
  individuals, Henry Ford for instance, or De Windt, Winston Churchill or
  Woodrow Wilson, not as heroes and leaders but as types and witnesses. They
  manifest streams of tendency in the social brain, systems of ideas at a point
  of maximum effectiveness.</p>

  <p>Then suddenly at this point the history lapses into something like
  melodrama. For a phase personalities assume such an importance as to seem to
  dominate the world's affairs, as Caesar and Cleopatra did or Mirabeau and
  Marie Antoinette. I think some explanatory links must be missing here, some
  comments that might have pointed the value of this episode in illuminating
  the play of motive that led to the Air Dictatorship. But let me give it as it
  came to me.</p>

  <p>The Air and Sea Control and the organization of the associated subsidiary
  Controls had been the work of a group of keen young men, moved to action by
  the growing disorder of life and directly inspired by De Windt and his school
  of writers. They had been full of generosity, enthusiasm and confidence. The
  first World Council elected in 1978 included most of these leaders of '65,
  now coming to middle age, one or two older acquisitions and only two
  additions from among the younger men. Arden Essenden, with his vigour of
  initiative, was not only the chairman but the natural leader of the first
  World Council. Only Ivan Englehart could compare with him in power of
  personality. There were finer and nobler minds present, but none others so
  emphatic and so available for the crude uses of popular admiration.</p>

  <p>There was, it seems, a curiosity in the world about Essenden; his name was
  better known than any of his colleagues; his portrait, though indeed through
  nothing worse than acquiescence on his part, got into circulation, as
  newspapers began to abound again. It was the method of the new world
  government to have no presidential or secretarial signatures to its public
  announcements; it was stated simply that the "Control", whichever it was, or
  the Council suggested, stated, proposed or had decided, and the World-State
  seal with its winged disc authenticated the document. But the idea spread by
  impalpable means that Essenden, who was known to have made the decisive
  speech for immediate world government at the second Basra Conference, might
  well have put his name whenever that seal appeared. His prestige grew and
  came back to his ears. There can be no doubt that his consciousness of a
  vague exterior support affected his attitude towards his colleagues and their
  common task.</p>

  <p>The historians of our text book, so far as some difficult passages in the
  stenography can be deciphered, weigh the good and bad effects of this
  reinforcement of Essenden's natural impatient decisiveness. They bring in
  other instances and compare him with other dictators. Indisputably there are
  crises in human affairs so urgent that many worthy considerations and
  qualifications are better disregarded and overborne rather than that action
  should be delayed. These critics of our time study the amount of
  justification that can be made out for Mussolini, for Stalin, Kemal, Hitler
  and the various other dictators during the economic debacle of the West, and
  I find this judgment of posterity very discordant with my own profoundly
  liberal and Anglo-Saxon prejudices. They stress the hopeless
  indeterminateness of the preceding parliamentary régime more than I should
  do.</p>

  <p>They do not extend anything like the same charity to Essenden that they do
  to the earlier dictators. He played the "strong man" rôle half a century too
  late. The pattern of development, they decide, had been fully provided by De
  Windt and his fellow theorists. Essenden, they insist, did not so much lead
  as "speak first", and with a needless haste, when the general decision was
  imminent. He induced the committee to strike too soon and too harshly at the
  old religious and political traditions that seemed to stand in the way of the
  Modern State. He found some of his colleagues slow in grasping things that
  seemed obvious to him. He was impatient and overbearing.</p>

  <p>Quite early after the declaration of world sovereignty there were
  altercations in the committee meetings between him on the one hand and
  William Ryan and Hooper Hamilton on the other. Shi-lung-tang also becomes an
  inexplicable thorn in Essenden's side, an enervating influence full of
  insidious depreciation. We find Rin Kay intervening with a gentle firmness in
  these disputes and Englehart fretting openly at their dissensions.</p>

  <p>This new world government, one must realize, was carrying on under
  conditions that were often saturated with emotion. There was still much
  uncertainty in the outlook; and this perhaps let in adventure and romance.
  The World Council was in effective possession of world power, but not in
  unchallenged possession. Even in 2000 C.E., nineteen-twentieths of mankind
  were still unassimilated to the organization. If the world was not rebellious
  it was mutinous, and there were plenty of alert and intelligent people in
  opposition, estranged people or people shaped to forms of thought altogether
  uncongenial to the reconditioning of human affairs on Modern State lines.</p>

  <p>It was inevitable that these disharmonies between the leading figures at
  the centre of things, and the similar veins of discord that broke the
  solidarity of the Fellowship with a thousand intricate streaks and patches of
  weakness, should find echoes and misinterpretations in the greater world
  outside the machine. That greater world was still prepared for heroes and
  villains, ready for blind partisanships and storms of suspicion. It wanted
  drama in its government. A legend came into being which exaggerated a
  supposed want of sympathy on the part of Essenden for the "priggishness" and
  "petty tyrannies" of the various Controls. He was supposed to be nobler
  stuff. He was credited with the intention of taking things into his own hands
  altogether and ruling the world in a more generous and popular spirit. As the
  history puts it: "An autocrat has always been the imaginative refuge of the
  crowd from hard and competent aristocracy."</p>

  <p>That Arden Essenden ever plotted to realize these dreams there is no
  evidence at all. No word, much less any deed, is on record to show that he
  was unfaithful to the Modern State. But there can be no doubt that he felt
  that he was a fine figure and very necessary to the World Republic. He felt,
  as Stalin had done before him, that men could not do without him.</p>

  <p>And then abruptly women come back into the history. We find a love
  intrigue flung across the stream of history. I did not notice until I came to
  this part of the world story how small a part women had played in the drama
  that began with the World War. In most countries they had been emancipated
  and given equal political rights with men before that disaster. That
  achieved, they vanish out of the picture throughout four decades of violence.
  There were indeed women leaders in the early stages of the Russian
  Revolution, but none filled a decisive rôle. And for all the leadership women
  exercised between the Twenties and the Eighties they might have been every
  one of them in kitchen, nursery, hospital, or harem. They lost what little
  political significance they had when queens went out of fashion. A
  considerable proportion of the Modern State Fellowship was feminine, but no
  women occupied decisive positions in the scheme. There were none on the World
  Council. They were doing vitally important work, educational, secretarial,
  executive, and the like, but it was ancillary work that did not lead to
  individual distinction.</p>

  <p>But at this point the historian of the year 2106 breaks his inadvertent
  taboo and two women's names appear, the names of Elizabeth Horthy and Jean
  Essenden, and we find the threads of human destiny running askew about a
  story of passionate love and passionate misbehaviour.</p>

  <p>Elizabeth Horthy, who caused the downfall and execution of Arden Essenden,
  was evidently a woman of splendid appearance and unfaltering conduct. She was
  an air pilot, and she seems to have liked to wear her uniform on occasions
  when most women would have been in a robe. She knew, says the history, what
  suited her. She was tall and evidently beautifully made; she "lifted her
  chin", it seems; she had a "broad brow" and a "serene" face. This I learn
  from quotations that are given from Essenden's letters to her. They are the
  letters of a man quite artlessly in love. But there is nothing in the notes
  to tell us whether she was dark or fair, what colour of eyes looked out from
  under that "broad brow", nor what sort of voice she had. Her love letters
  seem to have been pithy and extraordinarily indiscreet. Of her charm and
  distinction there can be no doubt. She was one of those women who seem
  radiant to men. She was "like sunshine"; she was "like heartening music".
  Again I quote Essenden. She made men her friends, except for Hooper Hamilton,
  who manifestly felt some obscure resentment against her.</p>

  <p>Now this young woman, with her obvious "bravery" and a powerful
  disposition for romance, seems to have come to Basra in the train of William
  Ryan. It is possible but improbable that she was his mistress. Apparently she
  took little or no interest in the immense task of the World Revolution except
  as a suitable background for her exciting personal adventure. She seems to
  have fallen in love with Essenden at sight and he with her. It may be she
  came to Basra intending to do that. Something theatrical about him was not
  too theatrical for her. They were both theatrical. She liked things to be
  magnificent, and perhaps her taste for magnificence was stronger than her
  critical powers.</p>

  <p>She seems to have given herself to him without hesitation or qualification
  or concealment. Theirs was&mdash;again I quote those artless letters of
  his&mdash;"the sort of love that flaunts itself like a flag".</p>

  <p>But there was a third principal in this primitive drama, the wife of
  Essenden, a woman of great energy, great possessiveness and obtrusive
  helpfulness. It had been her vanity to "inspire" Essenden. And in the cast of
  the drama was Ryan, loudly resentful at Essenden "stealing" his "air girl",
  and Hooper Hamilton, inexplicably malignant. We are left to guess at the
  incidents and details of the drama, which was after all a very commonplace
  drama, only that it was magnified to the scale of the world stage. It
  culminated in Jean Essenden bringing a charge before the World Council
  against her husband of being concerned in a reactionary plot against the
  Modern State. She had, she said, intercepted letters, though none were ever
  produced. The historian of the year 2106, reviewing the particulars of the
  case, declared that there was no real evidence at all of any guilty
  associations of either Elizabeth Horthy or Essenden with the widespread
  movement that certainly existed for a monarchist and individualist reaction.
  But at the time the accusation was all too plausible. In some of her scrawled
  notes to him it seems Elizabeth called him "my King".</p>

  <p>Moreover, Jean Essenden repeated the most incredible conversations with
  her husband: boasts of future glory, dark threats at his colleagues, strange
  replies to her remonstrances. She at least was an inflexible Modern
  Republican. Afterwards in a storm of remorse she retracted all this evidence,
  but only when it was too late. Probably it was half true. Probably it was
  reality a little refracted in her mind.</p>

  <p>It was Hamilton who sealed Essenden's fate. He presided over the Special
  Court that had been formed to try the case. "Some of the evidence may be
  given with a motive," he said, looking at the white face of the accusing
  wife. "But it is a small matter that Essenden should or should not be a party
  in this conspiracy. His real offence is that he should have allowed this
  situation to develop, that he should have permitted his attention to wander
  from the services of the Republic to personal gratifications&mdash;personal
  gratifications and displays. At least he has been guilty of egotism. He has
  sacrificed himself and the interest of the world that has wrapped about him
  to an intensely personal drama. The question of his specific guilt is an
  altogether minor matter. The question before us is not, 'What has Essenden
  done?' but, 'What are we going to do about Essenden?' There is need for
  repression coming; civil war and bloodshed are plainly upon us. This is no
  time for Great Lovers. Essenden has become ambiguous. He cannot lead us,
  and&mdash;how can we do without him? Things have come to this, Essenden, you
  are INCONVENIENT. Apart from this quarrel of the women, YOU ARE IN THE
  WAY."</p>

  <p>The notes quote these words from the gramophone records of the trial. For
  it appears that the historian of the year 2106 could sit at his desk and
  listen to the steel-band record of the proceedings; note the speeches and
  mark the inflexions of the voices.</p>

  <p>There was a pause, and then Essenden cleared his throat. "I see that I am
  in the way."</p>

  <p>It was decided that there should be no open trial and condemnation. That
  would have precipitated the revolt. A tabloid was to be given to him, and he
  was to take it privately. He might "sit in the spring sunshine amidst flowers
  and green trees" and take it in his own time.</p>

  <p>The record was cut deep, it seems, by the scream of Jean Essenden,
  protesting that that last half-hour should not be spent by the two lovers
  together.</p>

  <p>Through all the years to come those steel ribbons will preserve the shrill
  intonations of those distressful moments. "I can't bear THAT!" cried Jean
  Essenden&mdash;down to the end of time.</p>

  <p>"No," Elizabeth's actual words are given; "there is no need for you to be
  hurt any more. Don't be distressed, Jean, any more. It's over. It's all over
  for ever. I will go now. Out of the court now. I never meant to hurt Arden in
  this way. How was I to know? There is no need at all for us two even to say
  Good-Bye or be together any more. Jean, you couldn't help yourself. You had
  to do what you have done. But I never meant to hurt you. Or him."</p>

  <p>Those are her words as the shorthand notes give them, but we shall never
  hear the sound of them. But the man who wrote them down, a century after they
  were spoken, heard them as he wrote, heard her voice weaken, if it weakened.
  Was she speaking or was she making a speech? We are left guessing how far
  these words of hers betrayed her sense of drama or whether it had indeed the
  simple generosity it may have had.</p>

  <p>There is no description of the last moments of Arden Essenden, the man who
  had drafted the proclamation that founded the World-State. Possibly he did
  sit for awhile in some sunlit garden and then quietly swallowed his tabloid.
  He may have thought about his life of struggle, of his early days in the
  years of devastation and of the long battle for the World-State for which he
  had fought so stubbornly. Or perhaps according to all the rules of romance he
  thought only of Elizabeth. Much more probably he was too tired and baffled to
  think coherently and sat dully in the sunshine staring at those flowers which
  make the colophon to his story. Then the book closed for him. He died
  somewhere in the North of France, but the notes do not say precisely
  where.</p>

  <p>They are more explicit about the fate of Elizabeth Horthy, who killed
  herself that day. There was no tabloid for her. She took her nearest way out
  of the world by flying her machine to an immense height and throwing herself
  out. She went up steeply. It was as though she was trying to fly right away
  from a planet which had done with romance. "The aeroplane ceased to climb; it
  hung motionless, a quivering speck in the sky, and then began to waver and
  fall like a dead leaf. It was too high for anyone to see that its pilot had
  leapt free from it and was also falling through the air. A mere tattered rag
  of body was found amidst the branches of a little thicket of oak near
  Chantilly."</p>

  <p>A fortnight after Hooper Hamilton also succumbed to "egotism" and took an
  overdose of sleeping-draught at his summer-house in the Aland Isles.</p>

  <p>And with that this novelette-like interlude ends. It is elementary in its
  crudity. It is out of key with all that precedes it and all that follows. We
  are told there were other "stories" about the men of the First Council, but
  these other stories after this one sample are left to our imaginations. Its
  immense irrelevance tears the fabric of our history. But through the gap we
  see the pitiful imagination of humanity straining for a supreme intensity of
  personal passion.</p>

  <p>Did that young woman as she stepped out upon nothingness above the cirrus
  clouds feel that her life had been worth while? The history calls her, "that
  last romantic".</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap4_03"
     name="chap4_03">3. &mdash; FUTILE INSURRECTION</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The notes show the historians of 2106 convinced that there
  was no real complicity between Elizabeth Horthy and the leaders of the
  Federated Nationalists who now broke out into open revolt. The impression of
  her character made by her recorded words and deeds is, they argue, quite
  incompatible with the idea that if she had indeed been a revolutionary, she
  would have abandoned her fellow conspirators for a melodramatic suicide
  because of the execution of Essenden. Far more like her would it have been
  for her to fly to the rebels in Germany and give herself passionately to
  avenge and vindicate his memory. But plainly she did not care a rap for the
  monarchist conspiracy, and it is possible that she did not know of its
  existence. Both she and Essenden, there can be little doubt, lived and died
  loyal, in intention at least, to the Modern State.</p>

  <p>But it suited the revolt to seize upon her tragedy and use her as one of
  its symbols, and it was long believed that Essenden had retracted the
  socialist cosmopolitanism of the Basra Conference in favour of Federated
  Nationalism. It is interesting to find the legend of the poor old League of
  Nations presently become more powerful than its living reality, and ironical
  that it should supply the formula for an attempt to divide up the world again
  into "sovereign" fragments. The declaration of the so-called Prince Manfred
  of Bavaria put the League into the forefront of his promises. Alternatively
  he spoke of it as a World Federation of Free Peoples, and he promised Freedom
  of Thought, Freedom of Teaching, Freedom of Trade and Enterprise, Freedom of
  Religious Profession, Freedom from Basic English, Freedom from Alien
  Influence everywhere. As a foretaste of these good things, he released a
  little pogrom in the Frankfurt district where a few professing Jews still
  lingered.</p>

  <p>[From this point to another which I shall indicate when I reach it I am
  able to give a fairly trustworthy transcription of the notes&mdash;ED.]</p>

  <p>There was never anything that amounted to actual war during this period of
  disturbance; nothing that could be called a battle. The World Council had the
  supreme advantage of holding all communications in its hands, and, as
  military and naval experts could have told the rebels, there is no warfare
  without communications. Prince Manfred issued some valiant proclamations "to
  the World" before he took his tabloid, but since Basic English was repudiated
  by his movement, they were translated into only a few local languages,
  printed on stolen paper by hidden hand-presses, and sought after chiefly by
  collectors. The jamming of the public radio service was mischief rather than
  revolt. At first there was a certain revival of the manufacture of munitions
  in factories that had been seized by rebel bands, but generally these ended
  their output after at most a few weeks under the soporific influence of
  Pacificin. There were a few deserters from the Air Police and a certain
  number of small private aeroplanes in nationalist hands; but the net work of
  registration, vigilant police patrols, and the absence of independent
  aerodromes soon swept rebellion out of the air.</p>

  <p>There remained the bomb, the forbidden pistol, the dagger and the ambush.
  It was these that made the revolt formidable, forced espionage, search raids,
  restriction of private movement and counter violence upon the World Control,
  and rendered the last stages of the struggle a grim and indeed a terrible
  chapter in human history. In narrow streets, in crowds and conferences, in
  the bureaus of administrations and upon the new roads, lurked the
  death-dealing patriot. He merged insensibly with the merely criminal
  organizations of blackmail and crime.</p>

  <p>It was this murder campaign, the "Warfare of the Silenced and Disarmed",
  as Prince Manfred put it, which stiffened the face and hardened the heart of
  the Modern State for half a century. It took to "preventive" measures; it
  began to suspect and test; that horrible creature, the agent provocateur, was
  already busy again before 2000. He was busy for another decade; he did not
  certainly vanish from the world until the Declaration of Mégève in 2059, but
  there is no record of his activity after 2030. And the government which had
  begun its killing with Arden Essenden and Prince Manfred came to realize the
  extreme decisiveness and facility of the lethal tabloid. For the grosser
  forms of execution had given place to this polite method, and every condemned
  man could emulate the Death of Socrates, assemble his friends if he chose,
  visit some lovely place, or retire to his bureau. In vain the veteran Rin Kay
  protested in the committee that, just as he had argued long ago that men were
  not good enough to be Machiavellian, so now he declared they were not good
  enough to be given powers of life or death, incarceration or relief over
  their fellows. "You murder yourselves when you kill," he said.</p>

  <p>The rebels, however, were killing with considerable vigour and
  persistence, and their victims had no such calm and grace in their last
  moments. They were stabbed, shot, waylaid and beaten to death.</p>

  <p>"For a terror," wrote Kramer, "death must be terrible."</p>

  <p>"For murder," said Antoine Ayala, "death must be inevitable."</p>

  <p>In the end the penal code did seem to achieve its end. There were 5703
  political murders in 2005, and 1114 in 2007. The last recorded occurred in
  2034. The total is over 120,000. But during these twenty-nine years there
  were 47,066 political executions! Rihani estimates that more than seven per
  cent of these were carried out upon anonymous, circumstantial, or otherwise
  unsatisfactory evidence. Most were practically sentences by courts martial.
  The millennium arrived in anything but millennial fashion.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap4_04"
     name="chap4_04">4. &mdash; THE SCHOOLING OF MANKIND</a></h2>

  <p class="first">And now again the shorthand notes are troubled, disturbed
  and almost unreadable, and the resistances of Raven rise up and mingle with
  the proper text.</p>

  <p>It was the age-long issue between faith in compulsion and faith in the
  goodwill of the natural man that had invaded the record. It affects me as I
  transcribe now; I do not see how it can fail to affect any contemporary
  writer or reader. I get again that flavour, that slight but perceptible
  flavour of&mdash; what can I call it but INHUMANITY?&mdash;in the historian's
  contribution. These men whom we anticipate here are different in their
  fundamental ideas. This short transition of a hundred and seventy years is
  marked by a subtle change in the human heart. I wonder if the same kind of
  difference might not arise if we could bring a good contemporary mind of the
  early eighteenth century into untempered contact with our thoughts to-day.
  Would not such a mind find us nowadays rather hard and sceptical about things
  respected, rather harshly frank about things biological, rather misshapen in
  our sentimentalities?</p>

  <p>It is an old joke to revive such literary characters as Dr. Johnson or
  Addison and make them discuss contemporary things, but generally the fun goes
  no further than clothing modern reactions in old-fashioned phrases and
  costume. But in the light of my own response to the harshly lucid, cold, and
  faintly contemptuous criticism of our present resistances by the writer or
  writers of this 2106 document I find myself reviewing these old
  juxtapositions. I see that if we could indeed revive Johnson he would not
  only strike us as an ill-mannered, offensive, inadaptable and tiresome old
  gentleman who smelt unpleasantly and behaved worse, whose comments on life
  and events would be wide of the mark and discoloured with the echoes of
  antiquated controversies, but we should find that his contact with us would
  be pervaded by an incurable distress at our pace, at our strangely different
  values, our inhuman humanitarianism, as it would have seemed to him, and our
  cruel rationality. He who had sat so sturdily against his background of
  accepted and acceptable institutions, customs, and interpretations would find
  that background vanished and himself like a poor martyr in the arena with
  eyes upon him from every direction. Of course he would be hustled off to meet
  Mr. G. K. Chesterton, and that might prove the most painful of all his
  encounters. For Mr. Chesterton, who is posed so often as an avatar of the old
  doctor belongs to his own time quite as much as the most futuristic of us
  all.</p>

  <p>I am a hostile critic of present conditions and a revolutionary in
  essence; nevertheless, I can get on with the people about me because, even
  though my song is a song of revolt, it is in the same key and tempo as
  theirs; but I perceive that if I were transferred to this infinitely happier
  and more spacious world the history of Raven's reveals I should be
  continually and irreparably, in small things and great things alike,
  discordant. I should find nobody to get the point of my intelligent
  observations; I should laugh incomprehensively, fail to see the jokes that
  pleased these larger, more vigorous people, and the business of life would
  hurry past me. All sorts of things I had hoped for and forecast might be
  there&mdash;but in some essential way different and alien to me.</p>

  <p>It is one of the things that Raven's notes have taught me that a human
  mind, an adult human mind anyhow, is much less easily transplanted to a new
  time and climate than I had been wont to assume. To me, the story of Arden
  Essenden's bold leadership, his acute self-consciousness, and his
  uncontrolled love for Elizabeth Horthy seem matter for such another story,
  let us say, as Meredith's Tragic Comedians; but the historian of the year
  2106 finds him and her only material from which to dissect out the
  treacherous egotism of passion. Something in me rebels against that, just as
  it rebels against the assumption that the World War was a process of sheer
  waste, its heroisms and sacrifices blind blundering, and its significance out
  of all proportion less than the social and economic dislocations that caused
  it.</p>

  <p>And now that I come to these disconnected records of the harshly rational
  schooling of human motives under the Air Dictatorship, records that even
  Raven found no zest in copying, my distaste is as ineradicable as it is
  unreasonable. I feel that, but for "the accidents of space and time", I
  should have been one of the actively protesting spirits who squirmed in the
  pitilessly benevolent grip of the Air Dictatorship. But whether it suits my
  temperament or not, this story, as it came through Raven to me, has to be
  told.</p>

  <p>The men who made the great revolution and unified the world between 1965
  and 1978 were men of practically the same mental assumptions as our own. They
  were in direct mental and moral continuity with our contemporaries. While the
  reader turns the page, if there is any truth in this history, De Windt, still
  absolutely unknown, must be working either in Berlin or London upon that
  Theory of the Nucleated Modern State which was the decisive plan of that
  final consolidation, publishers must already have read and rejected the
  preliminary scheme of his great work, and in a year or so from now some Mrs.
  Essenden will be choosing the name of Arden for her boy. It is as close to us
  as that. The men of the first World Council, therefore, saw both sides of the
  business and wavered in feeling between our tradition and the new order they
  were creating. But the subsequent generation which constituted the Air
  Dictatorship had been shaped from the beginning in the aggressive bright new
  schools of the Modern State nuclei, they had fed on a new literature, they
  looked out upon fresh horizons, and their ideology had been determined more
  than anything else by the social psychologists and "new lawyers" of the
  American school. They were starkly constructive. Nuance to them was obscurity
  and compromise weakness.</p>

  <p>It is plain that so far as the future was concerned the first World
  Council with its rivalries and politics was far less effective than the
  unobtrusive Educational Control which worked under it during its régime and
  gradually drew together police, hygiene, schooling, and literature into one
  powerful nexus of direction. While the World Council was fighting for and
  directing and carrying on the unified World-State, the Educational Control
  was remoulding mankind. With the opening years of the twenty-first century
  (C.E.) the erstwhile leading figures of the revolution fall back into
  secondary places or vanish from the limelight altogether, and a
  simpler-minded, more determined group of rules comes to the front.</p>

  <p>[I resume my transcription here.]</p>

  <p>"The world is various enough without artificial variety," was a leading
  maxim of the Educational Control which created the men of the Air
  Dictatorship; and a variant of this maxim was: "It does not increase the
  interest of the human assembly to suffer avoidable mental cripples and
  defectives." So this body of teachers set themselves to guard new lives,
  beginning even with prenatal circumstances, from what they esteemed to be
  physical and mental distortion. There was no shadow of doubt upon this score
  for the Educational Control. Every possible human being had to be brought
  into the new communion. Everyone was to be exposed to the contagion of
  modernity. Every year now increased the power of the Modern State Fellowship;
  by 2000 it numbered five million; by 2010 thirteen. Every increase enabled
  the Educational Control to thrust its enquiring and compelling fingers more
  and more intimately into the recesses of human life. It had more men and
  women made to its pattern and a greater force of teachers and inspectors it
  could trust.</p>

  <p>There can be no denying the excellence of the immediate physical results.
  Historical Scenes in a Hundred Volumes witnesses from 1990 onward, not only
  to the resumption of the advance in the technique of picture-making and the
  abundance of pictures, but to the restoration of physical welfare. As the
  student turns over the pages he sees man straighten himself again, grow
  physically, become more alert. The slouching foot-dragging men and women, the
  aimless faces, the fattish and lumpish figures of improperly nourished
  people, the wretched clothing and ignoble makeshift gear of the Second
  Decline and Fall, disappear; after 1990 clothing is fresh and simple, and
  after 2010 it begins to be austerely beautiful.</p>

  <p>And this being achieved very largely through what the liberal thought of
  the nineteenth century would certainly have called "persecution". It is plain
  that the earlier World Council was all too disposed to leave great areas of
  the planet that did not "give trouble" alone. The new World Council, which is
  known also as the Air Dictatorship, would have none of that. There began a
  systematic attack upon the "lapsed regions", as they were called from the
  year 2006 onward. The government set itself in that year to "tidy up" the
  still half-barbaric peasant populations of Hayti, Ireland, West and Central
  Africa, South Italy, American Georgia and its associated states, Georgia in
  the Caucasus, Eastern Bengal, regions where traditional superstitions, secret
  societies, magic cults or sacrificial practices showed an obstinate
  persistence. There was a definite hunt for medicine men, sorcerers, priests,
  religious teachers, and organizers of sedition; they would be fined or
  exiled, and parents and others would be fined for "impeding" the education of
  their children at the cosmopolitan schools.</p>

  <p>Many critics of the Air Dictatorship are of opinion that this was a
  needless pursuit of dying customs and beliefs that might well have been left
  to fade out into mere fantasies and affectations. But the new generation of
  rulers took life too seriously for that. It is an issue that can never be
  settled, since we can only know what actually occurred.</p>

  <p>The old Catholic Church, it seems, was still in existence in these days,
  the last surviving Christian organization, but it was greatly impoverished,
  and it had suffered severely from schisms, evidently the result of imperfect
  communications throughout the dark decades. There was a Pope in Dublin and
  another in Rome and a coloured Pope in Pernambuco. From the legal point of
  view the Irish Pope was the most legitimate successor of St. Peter. He had
  been duly elected by the Conclave, but the Fascist organization objected that
  he was not of Italian origin, his original surname being O'Dowd and his
  Italian accent imperfect, and the cardinals were intimidated into a new
  election. Some feud between rival gang organizations in America seems to have
  been involved in this split, but the details are obscure and need not occupy
  the student's time here. There was in consequence a division of the American
  Catholic world between the Dublin and the Roman communion, and this led to a
  murderous series of feuds, riots, and small local wars. "Down with the Wop
  Pope!" said the Irish. One is reminded of that earlier splitting of the
  Church through the rivalry of the French monarchy and the Central European
  imperial system that set up a rival Pope in Avignon.</p>

  <p>Ireland was the last stronghold of Christianity. The Catholic religion had
  been compulsory in South Ireland from 1944 until 1980, and the Erse language,
  although that was largely corrupted by unavoidable English words and
  locutions, had also been made obligatory. Overt Birth Control knowledge had
  been successfully banned, though this produced no effect in the decline in
  population, and the Modern State nuclei had been boycotted more effectually
  there than in any other part of the world. The Dictatorship found itself
  fighting one of its most difficult battles for power with this tenacious
  people. The Irish came out in revolt all over the world. In Ireland after the
  maculated fever the population never rose above two millions, but there was a
  widespread Irish tradition throughout the English-speaking world. Some of the
  more brilliant and formidable antagonists of this schooling and drilling of
  our race that was going on, Paidrick Lynd, Arthur Fitzgerald, and Bernard
  O'Dwyer for example, came from Ireland. Oddly enough none of these three was
  a Catholic, and Fitzgerald at any rate had suffered a term of imprisonment
  for blasphemy, but the spirit of opposition was either innate in them or it
  had become ingrained in their natures.</p>

  <p>Let the student note the open alternative at the end of the preceding
  paragraph. It raises a question that remains unsettled to this day. It is the
  clue to our contemporary moral problem. The Air Dictatorship, with what was
  still a very under-developed science of social psychology at its disposal,
  had come upon one of the obscurest and most debatable of educational
  problems, the variability of mental resistance to direction and the limits
  set by nature to the ideal of an acquiescent co-operative world. De Windt,
  preoccupied by his gigantic schemes for world organization, had treated the
  "spirit of opposition" as purely evil, as a vice to be guarded against, as a
  trouble in the machinery that was to be minimized as completely as possible.
  The Air Dictatorship was carrying out and did carry out its world settlements
  on those assumptions. One may well believe that the world could have been
  unified into one enduring Pax Mundi in no other way. And yet they were faulty
  assumptions, and in the end they had to be abandoned for subtler and better
  conceptions of social interaction.</p>

  <p>As every practising teacher understands, resistance is a necessary factor
  in teaching. Soft non-resistant material takes an imprint very readily only
  to lose it again very quickly. Easy pupils make teaching slipshod. The
  difficulty but also the soundness of teaching increases with the amount of
  reaction in the learner. And also resistance involves a certain element of
  collaboration; the thing learnt becomes a resultant, incorporating elements
  introduced in the struggle. It is easier to carve cheese than a good piece of
  wood; every piece of wood has a bias, it has to be dealt with on its own
  terms, it has to be managed and humoured, but in the end there is no
  comparison in quality and interest between carved cheese and wood-carving.
  These are the commonplaces of our educationists. But the defence of the work
  of the Educational Control is that its repressive measures were aimed not at
  intrinsic but at artificial resistances left over from the pre-revolutionary
  age.</p>

  <p>In the old world of the early twentieth century there was a vast amount of
  crude generalization about what were called "racial" characteristics. There
  were generalizations about arbitrarily chosen agglomerations of mixed
  population&mdash;the Spanish for example, or "the West", "Russia", or the
  Jews; such generalizations were always unjust and inaccurate and often
  extremely mischievous. Nowadays we do not write of races any more, but we
  recognize groups of characteristics, evidently transmitted en bloc as a rule
  by associated genes, and anthropologists are steadily developing a scientific
  classification of human types. In few aspects do human beings vary more
  widely than in their recalcitrance. It is not a simple case that some people
  are more resistant and some less. There is a wide variation in the life cycle
  in this respect. Recalcitrance varies with age and sex. It varies with diet.
  Some types are obdurate as children but afterwards become more reasonable.
  Some reach a maximum of insubordination in adolescence. Generally speaking,
  passive resistance, unteachableness and obstinacy, but not insurrectionary
  energy, increase rapidly with age. And in certain populations, of which the
  Irish was one, there was a powerful access of resistance after adolescence in
  the male. It rose to the level of absolute refractoriness.</p>

  <p>Now the apologists for the "persecutions" of the Air Dictatorship maintain
  that its missionary teachers were already quite prepared with the sympathy
  and finesse needed to teach every type of human being they would encounter in
  the world. So long as resistance was personal between teacher and learner
  they welcomed it. At least they said they welcomed it. But when it came to
  the systematic organization of young people who would otherwise have had
  indifferent minds, so as to present a mass resistance and subversive
  opposition to the world order, the Educational Control, it is argued, was
  justified in hindering and suppressing books, meetings, teachings,
  agitations. It had the whip hand, and it would have been a sin not to have
  made use of that advantage. "We do not suppress individuality; we do not
  destroy freedom; we destroy obsessions and remove temptations. The world is
  still full of misleading doctrines, dangerous imitations and treacherous
  suggestions, and it is the duty of government to erase these"; so ran the
  uncompromising memorandum issued by the Educational Council in 2017.</p>

  <p>"We have to get a common vision of existence, a common idea of right and
  wrong, established throughout the whole population of the world, and
  SPEEDILY," this memorandum declares. "Natural instinct is no help in a
  labyrinth of artificialities. It has to be supplemented by either training or
  discipline. The better we train, the less need for oppression; the more
  thoroughly we crush out false presentations and agitations, the more freely,
  as well as safely, men can live. Things are rushing back headlong to
  prosperity, and we cannot face abundance and leisure with the present morale
  of the race. It has to be stiffened up; it has to be drilled to keep
  ranks."</p>

  <p>In 1955 humanity was suffering throughout the globe from disorder, famine
  and pestilence; its numbers were declining, and it might well have been
  supposed that it was driving towards extinction. The change of fortune was
  swift beyond precedent. As early as 2017 we have this clear intimation that
  its guides and rulers were contemplating the advance of plenty and an excess
  of leisure with terror.</p>

  <p>EDITOR'S NOTE</p>

  <p>I think that it may make things clearer for the reader here if I give a
  compact summary of the political forms assumed by the developing world
  government between 1965 and 2106. The writer of this history of Raven's,
  writing for his contemporaries, assumed them to be familiar with many
  institutions for which the readers of this book will be altogether
  unprepared. Fortunately the relations of the Communist and Fascist Parties to
  their respective governments give us a helpful parallel to the relations to
  the World Council, the actual world government after 1965, of what was called
  the Modern State Movement. It was its incentive and its conscience.</p>

  <p>The political structure of the world developed in this fashion:</p>

  <p>After the chaos of the war (1940-50) and the subsequent pestilence and
  "social fragmentation" (1950-60) there arose, among other attempts to again
  reconstitute a larger society, a combine of the surviving aviators and the
  men employed upon the ground plant of their trade and transport. This combine
  was called The Transport Union. It does not appear to have realized its full
  potentialities in the beginning, in spite of the forecasts of De Windt.</p>

  <p>It initiated various conferences of technicians and at last one in 1965,
  when it was reorganized as The Air and Sea Control and produced as subsidiary
  organs The Supply Control, The Transport (and Trading) Control, an
  Educational and Advertisement Control and other Controls which varied from
  time to time.</p>

  <p>It was this Air and Sea Control which ultimately gave rise in 1978 at the
  Second Conference of Basra to the World Council. This was the first declared
  and formal supreme government of the world. The Air and Sea Control then
  disappeared, but its subordinate Controls remained, and coalesced and
  multiplied as ministries do in existing governments, under the supreme
  direction of the World Council.</p>

  <p>There was no further change in essential political structure between 1978
  and 2059, but there was a great change in the spirit and method of that
  supreme government, the World Council. A new type of administrator grew up,
  harder, more devoted and more resolute than the extremely various men of the
  two Basra Conferences. These younger men constituted what our historian calls
  here the Second Council, though it was continuous with the first. There was a
  struggle for power involving the deaths of several of the earlier
  councillors, but no formal change of régime; there continued to be a World
  Council constituting the supreme government of the world. This Second Council
  is also referred to as the Air Dictatorship in its earlier years, and later
  on as the Puritan Tyranny. These are not exact constitutional terms but loose
  descriptive phrases. The membership of the World Council changed by
  individuals coming and going, but its character remained singularly uniform
  for over forty years. It grew more elderly in spite of a few youthful
  accessions. In 2045 its average age was 61.</p>

  <p>This Second World Council endured until a Conference at Mégève in Savoy
  (2059) reconstituted the world government on lines which are drawn out fairly
  plainly in the following chapters.</p>

  <p>And now for the relations of this series of governing bodies to the World-
  State Movement.</p>

  <p>The ideological developments that inspired these changes were initiated by
  a group of writers of whom De Windt was the outstanding figure. He built up
  the project for a world-state in all its essentials in a book on Social
  Nucleation published in 1942. The intrinsic quality of this book has been
  entirely overshadowed by its importance as a datum point in history. It is a
  slow laborious book.</p>

  <p>It was the seed of the Modern State Movement which furnished the plans of
  the Air and Sea Control. The Modern State Movement was never a formally
  constituted government nor anything in the nature of a public administration;
  it was the propaganda and development of a system of ideas, and this system
  of ideas produced its own forms of government. The "Movement" was initially a
  propaganda and research, and then a propaganda, research, and educational
  organization. Its active full members were called Fellows; it had a class of
  dormant members, whose relationship to the active category varied under
  different conditions and at different periods; and it had a class of
  neophytes or apprentices, as numerous or more numerous than its active
  Fellows. It ultimately incorporated the mass of adult mankind (and womankind)
  in its Fellowship.</p>

  <p>It was never divided up into regional bodies. Its Fellows were acceptable
  at any local centre they happened to visit. Naturally it began mainly as
  localized nuclei, but those localizations were merely for convenience of
  propaganda, teaching, and local purposes. The effective subdivision of the
  Fellowship was into FACULTIES, and these again were subdivided into sections
  and departments. There was to begin with a faculty of scientific research, a
  faculty of interpretation and education, a health faculty, a faculty of
  social order, a supply and trading faculty, a number of productive faculties,
  agricultural, mineral and so on. There were splits and coalescences among
  these faculties. Their splits and coalescences had a frequent relationship to
  the splits and coalescences of the Controls, because it was obviously a
  mental convenience for a faculty or faculties to correspond with one or more
  Controls.</p>

  <p>The faculties and their subdivisions, their sections and departments,
  possessed electoral central councils, but there never seems to have been a
  general directorate of the Modern State Movement after the early days in
  which it was one simple system of propaganda and enquiry nuclei; its nuclei
  almost from the outset differentiated naturally into faculties, each viewing
  human affairs from its own angle; the movement as a whole did not require a
  continuing directive council; there were only conferences when concerted
  action between diverse faculties was desirable.</p>

  <p>There never seems to have been any difficulty in the way of a man or woman
  belonging to two or more faculties at the same time, and this greatly
  facilitated the melting of one faculty into another. The Modern State
  Movement was an "open order" attack on social structures; it was a solvent
  and not a mould. The moulds were the Controls.</p>

  <p>The faculties and their sections, departments, and so forth developed very
  unequally; some dwindled to insignificance, and some on the other hand grew
  to unanticipated proportions and created their own distinctive organization
  and machinery. This was particularly the case with the social psychology
  department of the faculty of science, which annexed the whole faculty of
  training and advertisement by a sheer community of subject. This social
  psychology department of the faculty of science was given the legal and
  responsible direction of the Educational Control.</p>

  <p>This body of social psychologists and their associates became a great
  critical and disciplinary organism side by side with the World Council, which
  ultimately, as will be explained in the following chapters, it
  superseded.</p>

  <p>The world then ceased, it seems, to have any single permanent government
  at all. It remained under a series of primary Controls dealing with each
  other by the method of conference, namely the Controls of transport, natural
  products, staple manufactures, population (housing and increase), social
  sanitation (police and medicine), education (these two latter were later
  merged as the Behaviour Control), and the ever expanding activities of
  scientific research and creative work. So the world which had once been
  divided among territorial Great Powers became divided among functional Great
  Powers.</p>

  <p>Later a Bureau of Reconciliation and Cooperation seems to have grown up,
  which decided upon the necessity and method of inter-Control conferences. It
  was something rather in the nature of a Supreme Court than of a ruling
  council.</p>

  <p>Most of the old faculties of the Modern State Movement dissolved into
  technical organizations under these Controls, with the one exception of that
  former department of the science faculty the department of social psychology,
  which by 2106 had become, so to speak, the whole literature, philosophy, and
  general thought of the world. It was the surviving vital faculty of the
  Modern State Movement, the reasoning soul in the body of the race.</p>

  <p>In the end it becomes something like what the early nineteenth century
  used to think existed under the name of Public Opinion, the consensus of
  active thought and imagination throughout the world. It is plain that by 2106
  this rule by a pervasive intelligence had become an unchallenged success. It
  was all that was left by way of King, President, or Supreme government on
  earth.</p>

  <p>This assembling and clearing-up of statements which are otherwise
  scattered rather perplexingly through the text under consideration will not,
  I hope, annoy such readers as have already grasped what I have summarized
  here. I will now return to that text itself.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap4_05"
     name="chap4_05">5. &mdash; THE TEXT RESUMES:<br>
  THE TYRANNY OF THE SECOND COUNCIL</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The Air Dictatorship is also called by some historians the
  Puritan Tyranny. We may perhaps give a section to it from this point of
  view.</p>

  <p>"Puritan" is a misused word. Originally invented to convey a merely
  doctrinal meticulousness among those Protestants who "protested" against the
  Roman version of Catholicism, it came to be associated with a severely self-
  disciplined and disciplinary life, a life in which the fear of indolence and
  moral laxity was the dominant force. At its best it embodied an honourable
  realization: "I shall do nothing worth while and nothing worth while will be
  done unless I pull myself together and stiffen up my conduct." If the new Air
  Dictatorship was schooling the world with considerable austerity, it was
  certainly schooling itself much more so.</p>

  <p>The code of the first makers of the World-State had been a simple one.
  "Tell the truth," they insisted; "maintain the highest technical standards,
  control money and do not keep it, give your powers ungrudgingly to the
  service of the World-State." That seemed to leave them free for a good deal
  of refreshing self-indulgence, and it did. They ate, drank, and were merry,
  made love very freely, envied and competed with one another for power and
  distinction, and set no adequate guard upon the growth of rivalries and
  resentments. Our history has glanced at the fall and death of Essenden, but
  this is only one episode in the long and complicated history of the private
  lives of the first world committee. Slowly the details are being elucidated
  and analysed by a body of historical students. Except that the victims are
  dead, and cannot hear, the results are as pitiless as the old Christian fancy
  of the Recording Angel and his Book on Resurrection Day.</p>

  <p>They appear as very pitifully human; their sins happened to them, they
  were taken unawares in phases of fatigue, by resentment, by sensuality or
  flattery. Women were attracted by their prestige and offered the reassurance
  of love to their weaker moments. In many cases the moral downfall was due to
  the very limitlessness of the devotion with which they first gave themselves
  to their world task. They worked without rest. Then they would suddenly find
  themselves worn bare, bankrupt of moral energy. They had made no proper
  balance between the public task and the inward desire. Outbreaks of evil
  temper would follow, or phases of indolence or gross indulgence. The
  Fellowship was disconcerted; the outer world ran with scandal. "These
  Fellows," said their critics, "are no better than the pretenders and rascals
  of the old régime. Rin Kay, the wise, is consumed with affection for his
  little friend, and Ardasher of the experimental aeroplanes makes his young
  men do dangerous stunts to please a girl. Morovitz is collecting Persian
  miniatures quite unscrupulously and Fedor Galland spends half his time now
  making a garden at Babylon."</p>

  <p>The ambitious young men who were little boys when the first conference at
  Basra was held were educated by teachers who were none the less harshly
  zealous because they were doing relatively inconspicuous work and had no
  little friends nor miniatures nor gardens to amuse them. These teachers had a
  lively sense of their leaders' defects and of their own modest but real moral
  superiority. The youngsters under their teaching were saturated with
  constructive enthusiasm, but they were trained also to judge and condemn the
  weaknesses of their spent and tired predecessors. They learnt that the
  brightness of this new world that had been made for them was in danger from
  the very men who had made it. The technically more skilful and intensive
  teaching that had been given them had made them more self-conscious and wary
  in their behaviour, and far more capable of managing the detail of their
  lives. They were simple in principle and hard in detail. They had a modern
  wisdom about diet and indulgence; they regarded lack of fitness as a
  crime.</p>

  <p>The difference is evident in Historical Pictures, where one usually sees
  the older generation dressed either carelessly or picturesquely and often
  either self-consciously or gracelessly posed, while the younger men and women
  in the simpler and plainer clothing that was coming into fashion carry
  themselves like athletes. Austerity has become a second nature to them.
  Devotion and the sacrifice of the individual they carried to such a pitch
  that, for instance, it was considered unseemly for them to have portraits
  made, and there was no record kept of the names of the chairmen and of the
  movers of motions in the central committee during their ascendency. It has
  needed special research to rescue some of the names of this second generation
  of world rulers, who set up the Puritan Tyranny and made the Socialist
  World-State secure. One of the moving spirits was certainly Han H'su and
  another Antoine Ayala.</p>

  <p>They ousted their predecessors without any coup d'état, one by one,
  through sheer superiority in energy and working power. The great revolution
  was over; the World-State was in being. But it was not secure. It was a time
  for just such continuous detailed work as only a naturally able and energetic
  type with a hard training could hope to do. They were not selected by any
  voting or politics to fill the Council, they were selected by their own
  staying and driving power. The milder or subtler types could not keep the
  pace and fell into less authoritative positions. The influence of certain
  teachers and groups of teachers was very considerable. Three schools, the
  Unamuno Foundation at Coimbra, the Columbia University of New York, and the
  Tokio Social College, accounted for more than a third of the World Council in
  2017.</p>

  <p>For nearly forty years the new Council, with occasional renewals, worked
  and kept a whole generation of men and women working. As Aldous Huxley (1894-
  2004), one of the most brilliant of reactionary writers, foretold of them,
  they "tidied up" the world.</p>

  <p>There can be no denying the purification and rarefaction of the human
  scene that was achieved during their sway. They tightened up the disciplines
  of the Modern State Fellowship, and nevertheless the proportion of the
  Fellowship increased until it bade fair to become the larger moiety of adult
  mankind. The mental habits of the Fellowship, its habitual bearing, extended
  through the whole population. The Tyranny, says Vordin, altered the human
  face for ever. It closed the mouth and made the lips firmer, made the eyes
  steadier and more candid, opened the brow, altered the poise of the head,
  obliterated a number of wrinkles and habits of expression. Portraits of the
  earlier and later time confirm this generalization. One type of odd-character
  after another became rare and began to disappear from the human comedy.
  Rascals and recalcitrants grew old, sat in the sun for a time rather
  protestingly and vanished. They took many disagreeable and some whimsical
  casts of countenance with them. Sexual prostitution ceased and eliminated a
  characteristic defiance from feminine carriage. The trader found he had
  nothing to trade with and came into the employment of the Supply Control.
  Gambling, horse-racing, sport, generally went out of fashion, and those queer
  oblongs of pasteboard, "playing cards", retired to museums, never to emerge
  again. Every one of these vanishing interests or practices took its own
  scores of social types, of "reaction systems", to use the modern phrase, away
  with it. Faces ceased to be masks.</p>

  <p>Every year the world grew safer for the candid. The need for cunning and
  wary self-restraint diminished enormously, the habit of making a face a
  "mask". Humanity was extroverted. A lively self-forgetful interest in
  external things becomes more and more patent. The "worried" look of the
  introspective habit of mind disappears. "Everyone must know plainly," said
  the new rulers. "Men must be perplexed no more." The old religions could not
  emulate the moral prestige of the new cult, and even the resentments of the
  persecution that deprived them of their last shreds of educational influence
  could not preserve them. For nearly forty years this rule of the new saints,
  this resolute simplification and smoothing out of life, went on.</p>

  <p>History becomes a record of increasingly vast engineering undertakings,
  and cultivations, of the pursuit of minerals and of the first deep borings
  into the planet. New mechanisms appeared, multiplied, and were swept away by
  better mechanisms. The face of the earth changed. The scientific
  redistribution of population began. Yet there was little likeness to the
  world of to-day, as we know it. No age in human history has left us such
  strange and uncongenial pictures.</p>

  <p>Costume was not unpleasant during this period, because of its simplicity;
  the human figures in the scene at least are tolerable; but these scientific
  Puritans also produced some of the clumsiest architecture, the most gaunt and
  ungainly housing blocks, the dullest forests, endless vistas of straight
  stems, and the vastest, most hideous dams and power-stations, pylon-lines,
  pipe-lines, and so forth that the planet has ever borne. But at any rate they
  flooded the Sahara and made the North African littoral the loveliest land in
  the world. The productivity of mankind was now advancing by leaps and bounds,
  in spite of the severe restraint presently put upon the introduction of fresh
  labour-saving devices; and yet these Puritans were consumed by an
  overwhelming fear of leisure both for themselves and others. They found it
  morally necessary to keep going and to keep everybody else going. They
  INVENTED work for the Fellowship and all the world. Earth became an ant-hill
  under their dominion clean and orderly but needlessly "busy". So harshly had
  they reacted against the weaknesses of their seniors and so unable were they
  to mitigate their own self-imposed severities.</p>

  <p>Let us cast up the good mankind can attribute to this strange phase of
  sternness and grim repression. For all the faint masochist and sadistic
  flavour of its closing years, the good was beyond all measure greater than
  the evil. "The obliteration of out-of-date moral values" (the phrase is
  Antoine Ayala's) "and the complete establishment of a code of rigorous and
  critical self-control, of habitual service, creative activity, cooperation,
  of public as well as private good manners, and invariable truthfulness, were
  achieved for all time. We grow up so easily now into one free, abundant, and
  happy world that we do not realize the effort still needed even in the year
  2000 to keep life going upon what seem now to us the most natural and simple
  lines possible. We find it almost impossible to imagine the temptations to
  slacken at work, loiter, do nothing, 'look for trouble', seek 'amusement',
  feel bored and take to trivial or mischievous 'time-killing' occupations,
  that pursued the ill-trained under-vitalized, objectless common citizen
  before 2000 C.E. Still more difficult is it to realize how subtly these
  temptations were diffused through the mass and how hard they made a
  well-directed life. We have to trust the psychological experts about
  that."</p>

  <p>The New Puritans "disinfected" the old literature, for example. It is hard
  to see that now as an urgent necessity. These old stories, plays, and poems
  seem to us to convey the quaintest and most inexplicable systems of
  motivation conceivable, and we cannot imagine people being deflected by them;
  they might as easily be led astray by the figures on a Chinese screen or an
  Hellenic sarcophagus; but before the persecution those books were, as one
  censor called them, "fever rags". They stood then for "real life". They
  provided patterns for behaviour and general conduct. That queer clowning with
  insults and repartees, that insincerely sympathetic mocking of inferiors,
  that denigration of superiors, which constituted "humour" in the old days,
  strikes us as either fatuous or malicious. We cannot understand, for
  instance, the joy our ancestors found in the little blunders and
  misconceptions of ill-educated people. But then they also laughed at the
  cripples who still abounded in the world! Equally distasteful now is most of
  their "romance" with its false stresses, its unnecessary sacrifices and
  desperations. "Romance", says Paul Hennessey, "is essentially the violent and
  miserable reaction of weak spirits to prohibitions they cannot fairly
  overcome."</p>

  <p>We find the books glorifying war and massacre, and the tangled masses of
  suggestion that elaborated the innate hostility and excitement caused by
  difference of racial type, so unconvincing that it is difficult to believe
  that they ever gripped. But they did grip and compel. They drove innumerable
  men to murders, lynchings, deliberate torture. They dressed the foulest and
  cruellest of crimes in heroic colours. There had to be a break with these
  traditions before they could be seen as we see them now. It needed the heroic
  "priggishness" of the Air Dictatorship, putting away the old literature and
  drama for a time, suppressing the suggestion systems of the old religions and
  superstitions, jailing and segregating men and women for "hate incitement",
  ruthlessly eliminating sexual incitation from the lives of the immature and
  insisting upon a universal frank sexual hygiene, to cleanse the human mind
  for good and all and inaugurate the unconstrained civilization of to-day.
  There was no other way to Renaissance.</p>

  <p>Joseph Koreniovsky has called the Puritan Tyranny "the cold bath that
  braced up mankind after the awakening". Man, he says, was still "frowsty-
  minded" and "half asleep" in the early twenty-first century, still in urgent
  danger of a relapse into the confused nightmare living of the Age of
  Frustration. You may call it a tyranny, but it was in fact a release; it did
  not suppress men, but obsessions. None of us now can fully realize the value
  of that "disentanglement from tradition", because now we are all
  disentangled.</p>

  <p>And next to this ruthless "mental disinfection" of the world, and indeed
  inseparable from it, we must put the physical disinfection of mankind to the
  credit of the Air Dictatorship. Between 2000 and 2040 every domicile in the
  world was either destroyed and replaced, or reconditioned and exhaustively
  disinfected. There was an immense loss of "picturesqueness" in that process,
  and we shiver nowadays when we look at pictures of the white bare streets,
  the mobile rural living-boxes, the bleakly "cheerful" public buildings, the
  plain cold interiors with their metallic furniture, which everywhere replaced
  the huts, hovels, creeper-clad cottages and houses, old decaying stone and
  brick town halls, market houses, churches, mosques, factories and railway
  stations in which our tough if ill-proportioned and undersized forefathers
  assembled about their various archaic businesses.</p>

  <p>But between the same years the following diseases, the names of which
  abound in the old histories, and the nature of which we can hardly imagine,
  vanish from the human records: catarrh, influenza, whooping cough, sleeping
  sickness, cholera, typhus, typhoid, bubonic plague, measles, and a score of
  other infectious scourges. (Only yellow fever remained as a serious infection
  after 2050. That demanded the special effort of 2079 for its extirpation.)
  Syphilis and indeed all those diseases known as venereal, were stamped out
  completely in two generations; they were afflictions so horrible and
  disgusting that their description is not now considered suitable for the
  general reader. There was a similar world-wide attack on plant diseases and
  distortions, but of that the student will learn in his Botanical History.</p>

  <p>The psychologists who are rewriting human history have still many open
  questions to settle about the training and early influences that gave the
  world this peculiar group of rulers, and so the account of its hardening and
  deterioration remains incomplete. They admit that the Tyranny was in essence
  a liberation, but they insist that it left vitally important desires in the
  human make-up unsatisfied. Old traditions and mischievous obsessions were
  rooted in these desires, and the Tyranny had not been content with an
  eradication of the old traditions. It had denied the desires. It had pulled
  up the soil with the weeds. It had exalted incessant, even if pointless,
  activity above everything else in life.</p>

  <p>Overwork, a strained strenuousness, has been a common characteristic of
  the rulers of mankind in the past. It shows through the Edicts of Asoka, for
  example, and particularly in Rock Edict VI (Asoka, D. R. Bhandarkar, 1932,
  Classical Historical Studies, 21-118). "I am never satisfied," runs the
  Edict, "with the exertion or with dispatch of business. The welfare of the
  whole world is an esteemed duty with me. And the root of that, again, is
  this, namely, exertion and dispatch of business." A great majority of the
  successful Caesars and Autocrats from Shi-Hwang-Ti to Hitler have the same
  strenuousness&mdash; Alexander the Great perhaps was the chief exception, but
  then his father had done the work before him. Mussolini, the realizer of
  Italian Fascismo, in his Talks to Ludwig (Historical Documents Series 100,
  319) betrays an equal disposition for single-handed accomplishment and an
  equal disinclination to relinquish responsibility.</p>

  <p>All the chief figures of the Air Dictatorship betray, upon scrutiny, signs
  of the same drive to do too much and still to do more. They display all the
  traits of a collective weary conqueror, unable to desist and think and adapt
  himself. They went on ruling and fighting when their victory was won. They
  had tidied up the world for ever and still they went on tidying. After their
  first real successes they manifest an extreme reluctance to bring new blood
  into the responsible administrative task. They had arisen to power as a group
  by their usefulness, because they were unavoidably necessary to those
  original founders of the World-State whom they first served and then by sheer
  insistence upon performance pushed out of authority and replaced. The three
  virtues in a ruler according to Han H'su were punctuality, precision, and
  persistence. But it was a dictum of Paidrick Lynd's that "indolence is the
  mother of organization". They had none of that blessed gift of indolence.
  When the legacy of work that the first world revolution had left them was
  exhausted, they brought things at last to the necessity for a final
  revolution through their sheer inability to organize a direct succession to
  themselves or to invent fresh undertakings.</p>

  <p>That final revolution was the most subtle of all the substitutions of
  power that have occurred in human affairs, the most subtle and so far the
  last. The Dictatorship could suppress overt resistance; it could impose
  obedience to its myriads of injunctions and rules. But it could not suppress
  the development of general psychology nor the penetration of its own
  legislative and administrative activities by enquiry and criticism.</p>

  <p>The Department of General Psychology had grown rapidly until it had become
  the most vigorous system of activities in the scientific faculty of the
  Modern State Fellowship. In its preparatory stages it had taken the place of
  the various "Arts" and Law curricula of the old régime. It was the
  modernization of the "humanities". The founders of the World-State had given
  this particular department of the scientific faculty almost as great a
  directive and modifying power over both the Educational and Legal Controls as
  it exercises to-day. Even then it was formally recognized as the responsible
  guardian in the theory of Modern State organization. It more than realized
  the intentions of De Windt. It became the thought, as the World Council had
  become the will, of mankind acting as a whole. And since the education and
  legal adjustment of the World-State was thus under the direction of a
  department of research continually advancing, they differed diametrically in
  character from the education and teaching of the old world order.</p>

  <p>The student cannot keep this difference, this flat contrast, too clearly
  in mind. He will never understand the historical process without it. The Old
  Education existed to preserve traditions and institutions. Progressive forces
  arose as a dissent from it and operated outside its machinery. In the
  eighteenth, nineteenth, and early twentieth century education was always a
  generation or so behind living contemporary ideas and the schoolmaster was a
  drag on mankind. But the New Education, based on a swiftly expanding science
  of relationship, was no longer the preservation of a tradition, but instead
  the explanation of a creative effort in the light of a constantly most
  penetrating criticism of contemporary things. The new schoolmaster showed the
  way, and the new education kept steadily ahead of contemporary social fact.
  The difference of the New Law and the Old Law was strictly parallel. If a man
  of the year 1900 had been told of a progressive revolution led by lawyers and
  schoolmasters inspired by scientific ideas, he would have taken it as a
  rather preposterous joke, but to-day we ask, "How else can the continuity of
  a progressive revolution be sustained?"</p>

  <p>The failure of the German revolution of 1918 and the relapse of that
  unfortunate country into the puerility and brutish follies of Hitlerism was
  entirely due to the disregard of the elementary principle that no revolution
  could be a real and assured revolution until it has completely altered the
  educational system of the community. Every effective old-world revolution was
  a revolt against an established education and against the established
  law.</p>

  <p>The rôle of the modern Education Control in preserving, correcting, and
  revivifying the progressive process in human affairs had already been
  manifested by the supersession of the leading personalities of the Basra
  conference in the World Council by their successors who became the Air
  Dictatorship. Now these men in their turn found the instruments of government
  becoming recalcitrant in their hands and obeying the impulse of unfamiliar
  ideas. They had cleared and cleansed the site while social science had been
  preparing the idea of the new structures that were to stand upon it, and now
  they found themselves confronted by an impulse towards creation and
  enrichment entirely discordant with their habits of administration. Their
  subordinates began to send back the instructions given them as "insufficient
  and not in accordance with the psychology of the workers"&mdash;or other
  people&mdash;"concerned". Schemes were condemned by those to whom they were
  entrusted as unnecessarily toilsome or needlessly ungracious. Workers took
  matters into their own hands and demanded more pleasant processes or more
  beautiful results. The committee was disposed at first to insist upon
  unquestioning obedience. Thereupon the Education Control produced a masterful
  argument to show "the social harmfulness of unquestioning obedience".</p>

  <p>There could be no greater contrast in the world than that between the
  older revolutionary crises in human affairs and this later conflict of wills.
  The old revolutions were at best frantic, bawling, sentimental affairs in
  which there was much barricading of roads and destruction of property; people
  were shot abundantly and carelessly and a new régime stumbled clumsily to
  responsibility on the ruin and reversal of its predecessor. Such revolutions
  were insurrections of discontent against established institutions. But this
  last revolution was the cool and effectual indictment of the world executive
  by a great world wide educational system. It was not an insurrection; it was
  a collateral intervention. The new order arose beside its predecessor, took
  matters out of its hands and replaced it.</p>

  <p>The need for an intolerant militant stage of the World-State had passed.
  The very reason for the disciplines of the Puritan Tyranny had been dissolved
  away in the completeness of its victory. But the last men to realize this
  were the old men who now sat trying to find tasks to keep humanity out of
  mischief in the bureau of the World Council.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap4_06"
     name="chap4_06">6. &mdash; AESTHETIC FRUSTRATION:<br>
  THE NOTE-BOOKS OF ARISTON THEOTOCOPULOS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">It is a growing custom of historians, and we have already
  followed it freely, to vivify their general statements by quotations from
  contemporary descriptive writers. As histories have disentangled themselves
  from their primitive obsession about rulers and their policies, they have
  made a more and more extensive use of private memoirs, diaries, novels,
  plays, letters, sketches, pictures and the like. Once upon a time washing
  bills and memorandum books were below the "dignity of history". Now we esteem
  them far above acts of parliament or diplomatic memoranda. And certainly
  there is no more convenient source of information about current ideas and
  feeling under the Air Dictatorship than the cipher Note Books of that gifted
  painter and designer Ariston Theotocopulos (1997-2062). For thirty-seven
  years until his death, he wrote in these books almost daily, making his own
  shrewd comments on current events, describing many odd and curious
  occurrences, noting very particularly his own emotional reactions, and
  adorning them all with a wealth of sketches, dreams, caricatures and the
  like, which make the full edition in facsimile, with a translation, among the
  greatest delights of the book-lover. The bulk of this matter does not concern
  the student of general history at all, and yet it is possible to pick out
  from it material for a far clearer realization of life under the second
  Council than could be derived from a score of abstract descriptions.</p>

  <p>The earlier of these volumes are coloured by the irritation of the writer
  with three particular things: the restrictions upon private flying, his
  difficulties in finding scope for his genius, and the general want of beauty
  and graciousness in life. At that time there were no privately owned
  aeroplanes and no one could act as an air pilot who was not an active Fellow
  of the Modern State organization and subject to its rules and disciplines.
  Theotocopulos had an anarchistic soul, and his desire to wander freely above
  the mountains and clouds, to go whither he liked at his own sweet will,
  unhampered by any thought of immediate "service", became an obsession with
  him. "If they would let me alone I would give the world something," he
  scribbles. "But what on earth is the good of those blighted old Master
  Decorators telling me to do this and that? Did I come into the world to
  imitate and repeat things done already?"</p>

  <p>And in another place he notes: "Some damned official flying overhead on
  his way to preventing something. It spoilt the day for me. I couldn't THINK
  any more."</p>

  <p>Then comes a cry of agony. "The lay-out of all this terracing is wrong.
  What is the good of putting me to do a frieze of elephants on a wall that
  ought to come down again? If I do anything good that wall will stay where it
  is. The better I do it, the more likely they are to keep that wall. And it's
  wrong. It's wrong. It's wrong."</p>

  <p>A few pages on, one word is all alone by itself: "ELEPHANTS!"</p>

  <p>Then follows a string of caricatures of that animal which Li has
  characterized as acute biological criticism. Theotocopulos had been vividly
  interested in elephants, but now he had tired of them. He represents them as
  diaphanous or altogether transparent, and reveals the distresses of their
  internal lives. And there is a whole page of incredibly wicked elephants'
  eyes.</p>

  <p>He was working on the rather deliberate decoration of the main-road system
  then in course of construction, running from Cape Finisterre through North
  Italy and along the North Black-Sea Dyke to the Crimea and Caucasia. That
  system has since been deflected from the Ligurian coast northward, but at
  that time it was made to follow by the sea to Genoa, and thence passed in a
  great cutting through the mountains to the plain of the Po and so to the
  still existing Chioggia viaduct. It was one of a not very ably conceived
  system of world roads that was greatly modified before its completion in our
  own time, and it was carried out with a massiveness and a solidity of
  ornamentation that witness to the World Council's incapacity to realize that
  Change was still going on. Those roads seem to have been planned for all
  time. They indicate mental coagulation.</p>

  <p>Theotocopulos was engaged upon the coast section between the old town of
  Nice to the old port of Genoa. It was driven in a series of flattened curves
  that straightened out in places to a right line, cutting brutally through
  headlands and leaping gulfs and bays in vast viaducts. Above and below the
  slopes were terraced with natural or imitation marble walls and the terraces
  were planted with oranges, lemons, vines, roses, olives and agaves. These
  terraces went up, as Theotocopulos says, "relentlessly" to the old Corniche
  Road above, broken only by a few masses of evergreen trees. The ruins of the
  villas and gardens of the Capitalist era and most of the towns along the
  coast that Titus Cobbett had visited and described seventy-odd years before
  had now been cleared away; a few groups of residential buildings occurred
  here and there, and pretentious staircases, which were rarely used because of
  the lifts they masked, led down to beaches and holiday places and harbours
  for pleasure boats and fishermen. These holiday places and the residential
  buildings were low and solid-looking, after the fashion of the time, and they
  provoked Theotocopulos to frenzy. He caricatured them and spotted his
  drawings with indecent words. It is amazing how truthfully he drew them and
  how ingeniously he distorted them. He represented them as cowering into the
  earth like the late buildings of the war years, from which they certainly
  derived their squatness.</p>

  <p>"We still dream of air raids and war in the air," he said, and he speaks
  elsewhere of "the inmates of those fortifications.... If only I could get
  hold of an aeroplane and a bomb! Perhaps after all there is some sense in
  keeping intelligent people like me out of the air, with this sort of stuff
  about."</p>

  <p>His task unhappily kept him in close contact with all this squat
  architectural magnificence. He had won distinction at an unusually early age
  for his brilliant drawings of men and animals; he had a grotesque facility
  for seeing into bodies and conveying his sense of internal activities; before
  his time the only anatomy known to artists had been muscular anatomy; and he
  was set to "decorate" an ungainly stretch of wall near Alassio with a frieze
  of elephants. It is necessary to explain that in those days there was the
  completest divorce in people's minds between aesthetic and mechanical
  considerations. First you made a thing, they thought, and then you decorated
  it. It seems almost incredible now, but the engineers of the Air Dictatorship
  were supposed and expected to disregard all thought of beauty in what they
  did. If they made something frightful, then the artist was called in to sugar
  the pill. There, as in so many things, the restless sensitive mind of
  Theotocopulos anticipated the ideas of to-day. "Engineers ought to be
  artists," he says, "anyhow; and artists ought to be engineers or leave
  structural work alone." This wall of his still exists; his decoration has
  preserved it, even as he foresaw. It just remains for his sake, a lesson for
  students and a monument to his still incomparable talent.</p>

  <p>"Took a holiday," he notes one day, "and rowed about five miles out to
  sea. These disproportions grow worse as one gets away from them. Never before
  have I seen anything that got uglier as it receded in perspective. This coast
  does. The road is too broad and big. There will never be that much traffic.
  The population of the world isn't increasing and on the whole it rushes about
  less than it did. One hundred and twelve metres of width! What is this coming
  torrent of traffic from Finisterre to God knows where? Not a sign of it as
  yet. Nor ever will be. The little lizards get lost across that glassy surface
  and die and dry up. Artless earthworms crawl out upon it and perish. One sees
  them by the thousand after wet weather. No shade for miles. The terraces are
  badly spaced and the walls that sustain them look gaunt. There is no sympathy
  in all this straight stuff with the line and movement of the hills behind.
  They LIVE. And this accursed habit of building houses close to the ground!
  Damn it, don't we build to get away from the ground?"</p>

  <p>And then suddenly in big capitals comes one word: "PROPORTION!"</p>

  <p>After that he meditated with his pencil in hand, jotting down his
  thoughts. "The clue to life. Not simply beauty. There is no evil but WANT OF
  PROPORTION. Pain? Pain arises out of a disproportion between sensations.
  Dishonesty? Cruelty? It is all want of proportion between impulse and
  control...."</p>

  <p>It is interesting to trace in the notebooks how he tries over ideas that
  are now familiar to everyone. He worries between the ideas of proportion and
  harmony. Then he hits on the discovery that all history is a record of
  fluctuations in proportion. To-day, of course, that is a commonplace. We have
  told the economic and political history of the twentieth century, for
  instance, almost entirely as the story of an irregular growth of the elements
  of life, hypertrophy of economic material going on concurrently with a
  relative arrest of educational, legal, and political adjustment. The first
  dim realizations of these disharmonies were manifested by the appearance of
  "planning", those various crude attempts to make estimates of quantities in
  social life of which the Russian Five Year Plan was the first. After 1930,
  the world was full of Plans, and most of them were amazingly weak and
  headlong plans.</p>

  <p>We learn from these notebooks of Theotocopulos how imperfectly this idea
  of really deliberate quantitative preparation in the activities of our
  species was apprehended even in the early twenty-first century. Just as the
  war complex ran away with men's minds in the war period, so now political
  unity and uniformity and an extravagant concentration of enterprise upon
  productive efficiency had outrun reason. The interest of these notebooks lies
  exactly in the fact that they are not the writings of a scientific social
  psychologist, but of a man who was, except for his peculiar genius and energy
  of expression, a very ordinary personality. They tell us how common people
  were taking the peculiar drive of the times, how the general mind was
  puzzling out its new set of perplexities and asking why after having
  abolished war, restored order, secured plenty, defeated the fears and
  realized the wildest hopes of the martyr generations, it was still so far
  from tranquillity and happiness.</p>

  <p>"Growing pains," he writes abruptly. "That was old Lenin's phrase. Is a
  certain want of proportion unavoidable?"</p>

  <p>After that flash in the pan, the notebook wanders off into a dissertation
  upon Levels of Love, of no importance for our present purpose. But that idea
  of "Growing Pains" was working under the surface all the time. Suddenly
  appear pages of sketches of strange embryos, of babies and kittens and
  puppies, all cases of morbid hypertrophy. "Is want of proportion inevitable
  in all growth? Nature seems to find it so, but she always has been a
  roundabout fumbler. She starts out to make a leg, and when it comes out a
  wing she says, 'Eureka! I MEANT to do that.' But in DESIGNED WORK? In
  engineering for example?"</p>

  <p>His mind goes off to the making of castings, the waste in grinding, the
  problems that arise in assembling a machine.</p>

  <p>"Nature corrects the disproportions of growth by varying the endocrines,"
  he reflects. "And when a house has got its frames set up and its walls built,
  we turn out the masons and put in the plasterers and painters. So now. A
  change of régime in the world's affairs is indicated. New endocrinals. Fresh
  artisans."</p>

  <p>This particular entry in the notebook is dated April 7, 2027. It is one of
  the earliest appearances of what presently became a current phrase, "change
  of régime".</p>

  <p>The preoccupations of Theotocopulos with the physical and mental aspects
  of love, his extraordinary knack of linking physiological processes with the
  highest emotional developments, need not concern us here, important as they
  are in the history of aesthetic analysis. For a year or so he is concentrated
  upon his great "Desire Frieze" in the Refectory of the Art Library at
  Barcelona, and he thinks no more of politics. He likes the architects with
  whom he is associated; he approves of the developments at Barcelona, and he
  is given a free hand. "These fellows do as they like," he remarks. "A great
  change from all those damned committees, 'sanctioning' this or asking you to
  'reconsider' that." Then he comes under the influence of that very original
  young woman from Argentina, also in her way a great artist, Juanita Mackail.
  Sketches of her, memoranda of poses and gestures, introduce her. Then he
  remarks: "This creature thinks." So far he has never named her. Then she
  appears as "J" and becomes more and more frequent.</p>

  <p>"There is something that frightens me about a really intelligent woman.
  Was it Poe or De Quincey&mdash;it must have been De Quincey&mdash;who dreamt
  of a woman with breasts that suddenly opened and became eyes? Horrid! To find
  you are being looked at like that."</p>

  <p>Following this a page has been torn out by him, the only page he ever tore
  out, and we are left guessing about it.</p>

  <p>An abrupt return to political speculation in the notebooks follows. A
  number of entries begin, "J says", or end, "This is J's idea."</p>

  <p>Then some pages later he repeats: "This creature thinks. Do I? Only with
  my fingers. Language is too abstract for me. Or is it true, as she says, that
  I am mentally lazy. MENTALLY LAZY&mdash;after I had been talking continuously
  to her for three hours!</p>

  <p>"It seems all my bright little thoughts don't amount to anything compared
  with the stuff these social psychologists are doing. I have a lot to learn. I
  suppose J would schoolmistress anybody."</p>

  <p>The notebooks keep the fragile grace and mental vigour of Juanita Mackail
  alive to this day. She was the sort of woman who would have been a socialist
  revolutionary in the nineteenth century, a commissar in Early Soviet Russia
  or a hard worker for the Modern State in the middle twentieth century. Now
  she was giving all the time her strongly decorative idiosyncrasy left free to
  the peculiar politics of the period. It is plain that before she met
  Theotocopulos she was already politically minded. She had had a feeling that
  the world was in some way not going right, but her clear perception of what
  had to be done about it came only with her liaison with him. The notebooks
  with their frankness and brutality tell not only a very exceptional love
  story, but what is perhaps inseparable from every worthwhile love story, a
  mutual education. Theotocopulos was her first and only lover. To begin with
  he had treated her as casually as he had treated the many other women in his
  life, and then it is plain that, as he began to find her out, his devotion to
  her became by degrees as great or greater than her devotion to him.</p>

  <p>He studied her. He made endless notes about her. We know exactly how she
  affected him. How he affected her we are left to guess, but it is plain that
  for her there was at once the magnificence of his gifts and the appeal of his
  wayward childishness. The former overwhelmed her own. It is plain in her
  surviving work. The earlier work is the best. He asks twice, "Am I swamping
  J? Her stuff is losing character. She is borrowing my eyes. That last
  cartoon. Am I to blame? It WAS such lovely stuff. Once upon a time." And he
  writes: "This maternity specialization is Nature's meanest trick on women. If
  they are not going to be mothers, if they CAN'T be mothers, why on earth
  should they be saturated with motherhood? Why should J think more about
  getting me a free hand to do what I please than she does about her own work?
  She does. I haven't asked her. Or have I, in some unconscious way, asked her?
  No, it's just her innate vicious mothering. I am her beloved son and lover
  and the round world is my brother, and every day her proper work deteriorates
  and she gets more political and social-psychological on our account."</p>

  <p>From that point onward the trend of these notebooks towards politics
  becomes very strong. The early volumes express the resentments of an isolated
  man of extreme creative power who finds himself singlehanded and powerless in
  an unsympathetically ordered world. The late show that same individuality
  broadening to a conception of the whole world as plastic material, sustained
  by a sense of understanding and support, coming into relationship and
  cooperation with an accumulating movement of kindred minds. At last it is not
  so much Theotocopulos who thinks as the awakening aesthetic consciousness of
  the world community.</p>

  <p>"The change of régime has to be like a chick breaking out of its egg. The
  shell has to be broken. BUT THE SHELL HAD TO BE THERE. Let us be just. There
  is proportion in time as well as in space. If the shell is broken too soon
  there is nothing to be done but make a bad omelette. But if it isn't broken
  at the proper time, the chick dies and stinks."</p>

  <p>The forty-seventh notebook is devoted almost entirely to a replanning of
  the subject of his early animadversions, the Ligurian coast. That notebook
  proved to be so richly suggestive that to-day some of his sketches seem to be
  actual drawings of present conditions, the treatment of the Monaco headland
  for example, and the reduction of the terraces. But his dreams of
  orange-groves are already quaint, because he knew nothing of the surprises in
  tree form that the experimental botanists were preparing. The forty-ninth
  booknote is also devoted to planning. "Plans for a world," he writes on the
  first page. "Contributions." He seems to have amused himself with this book
  at irregular intervals. There are some brilliant anticipations in it and also
  some incredible fantasies. Occasionally, like every prophet, he finds detail
  too much for him and lapses into burlesque.</p>

  <p>There is a very long note of a very modern spirited discussion about
  individuality which he had with Juanita when apparently they were staying
  together at Montserrat. The notes are the afterthoughts of this talk, "shots
  at statement" as he would have called them, and they bring back to the reader
  a picture of that vanished couple who strolled just sixty years ago among the
  tumbled rocks and fragrant shrubs beneath the twisted pines of that high
  resort, both of them so acutely responsive to the drift of ideas that made
  the ultimate revolution&mdash;she intent and critical, holding on to her
  argument against his plunging suggestions, like someone who flies a kite in a
  high wind.</p>

  <p>"The individual is for the species; but equally the species is for the
  individual.</p>

  <p>"Man lives for the State in order to live by and through&mdash;and in
  spite of&mdash; the State.</p>

  <p>"Life is a pendulum that swings between service and assertion. Resist,
  obey, resist, obey.</p>

  <p>"Order, discipline, health, are nothing except to make the world safe for
  the aesthetic life."</p>

  <p>"We are Stoics that we may be Epicureans."</p>

  <p>"Exercise and discipline are the cookery but not the meal of life.</p>

  <p>"Here as ever&mdash;PROPORTION. But how can proportion be determined
  except aesthetically?</p>

  <p>"The core of life is wilfulness."</p>

  <p>So they were thinking in 2046. Have we really got very much further
  to-day?</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap4_07"
     name="chap4_07">7. &mdash; THE DECLARATION OF MÉGÈVE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Theotocopulos and his Juanita were present at the Conference
  at Mégève which wound up the second World Council. They both seem to have
  been employed upon the decoration of the temporary town that was erected for
  this purpose on those upland meadows. The notebooks, in addition to some very
  beautiful designs for metal structures, contain sketches of various members
  of the Council and some brilliant impressions of crowd effects in the main
  pavilion. There is also a sketch of a painting Theotocopulos afterwards made;
  it appears in all our picture-books of history: the tall presence of old
  Antoine Ayala, standing close to the aeroplane in which he departed for his
  chosen retreat in the Sierra Nevada; he is looking back with an expression of
  thoughtful distrust at the scene of his resignation. The pilot waits
  patiently behind him. "Well, well," he seems to say. "So be it." The sinking
  sun is shining in his eyes, so that they peer but do not seem to see.</p>

  <p>The drawing of nine of the World Councillors listening intently to the
  statement of Emil Donadieu, the secretary of the Education Faculty, is almost
  equally well known.</p>

  <p>It was the most gentle of all revolutions. It might have been a thousand
  years away from the fighting and barricading, the pursuits and shootings and
  loose murderings, of the older revolutionary changes. The Council suffered
  not overthrow but apotheosis. Creation asserted itself over formal
  construction and conservation. For a decade and more the various Controls had
  been showing a greater and greater disregard of the Central Council; they had
  been dealing directly with one another, working out their immense
  cooperations without the intervention&mdash;which was more and more
  inhibition&mdash;of the overriding body. It was the Education Faculty of the
  Control of Health and Behaviour that had at last provoked the gathering. It
  had in its own authority set aside the prohibitions on naked athleticism
  which had been imposed by the Council in its "general rules of conduct"
  thirty years before. The matter was a trifling one, but the attention of the
  Council was drawn to it; and it was decided to choose the occasion for a
  definite assertion of the Council's authority. Was there still a Supreme
  Government in the world? was the question posed by the veteran ruling body.
  Probably it seemed to them quite imperative that there should be a supreme
  overriding body, and the bland exposition of Emil Donadieu which dispelled
  this assumption must have been an illuminating revelation to them of the
  march of human ideas since those days of youthful zeal and vigour when they
  found themselves directing the still militant World-State.</p>

  <p>In those days the need for concentrated leadership had prevailed over
  every other human consideration. It had been necessary to fight and destroy
  for ever vast systems of loyalties and beliefs that divided, misled and
  wasted the energies of mankind. It had been necessary to replace a chaos of
  production and distribution for individual profit by an ordered economic
  world system. But once this vast change-over was made and its permanence
  assured by the reconstruction of education on a basis of world history and
  social science, the task of a militant World-State was at an end. The task of
  the World Council was at an end.</p>

  <p>"But then who is to govern the world?" asked Eric Gunnarsson, the youngest
  and most ambitious member of the Council.</p>

  <p>"No need to govern the world," said Donadieu. "We have made war
  impossible; we have liberated ourselves from the great anti-social traditions
  that set man against man; we have made the servitude of man to man through
  poverty impossible. The faculties of health, education, and behaviour will
  sustain the good conduct of the race. The controls of food, housing,
  transport, clothing, supply, initiative, design, research, can do their own
  work. There is nothing left for a supreme government to do. Except look up
  the world it has made and see that it is good. And bless it."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Eric Gunnarsson, "but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>These words are registered in the phonograph record of the debate. And
  with these two words Eric Gunnarsson, the ambitious young man who may have
  dreamt at one time of being President of the World, vanishes from
  history.</p>

  <p>Donadieu went on to a brief history of government in human affairs, how at
  first man could only think in personifications and had to conceive a tribal
  God and a tribal King because he could not conceive of organized cooperation
  in any other way; how Kings remained all too individual and all too little
  social for anything but the narrowest tribal and national ends, and how
  therefore they had to be controlled and superseded by councils, assemblies
  and congresses, which in their turn became unnecessary. These ruling bodies
  clamped men together through ages of discord until at last the race could be
  held together in assured permanence by the cement of a universal
  education.</p>

  <p>But the gist of that debate was embodied in the "Declaration of Mégève"
  with which the Conference concluded its deliberations.</p>

  <p>"The World-State now follows all the subordinate states it swallowed up to
  extinction; the supreme sovereign government, which conquered and absorbed
  all minor sovereignties, vanishes from human affairs. The long, and often
  blind and misdirected, effort of our race for peace and security has at
  length succeeded, thanks to this great Council that now retires. It retires
  with the applause and gratitude of all mankind. And now in serenity and
  security we can survey the property it has redeemed from waste, this planet
  and its possibilities, our own undeveloped possibilities too, and all the
  fullness of life that lies before us. This is the day, this is the hour of
  sunrise for united manhood. The Martyrdom of Man is at an end. From pole to
  pole now there remains no single human being upon the planet without a fair
  prospect of self-fulfilment, of health, interest, and freedom. There are no
  slaves any longer; no poor; none doomed by birth to an inferior status; none
  sentenced to long unhelpful terms of imprisonment; none afflicted in mind or
  body who are not being helped with all the powers of science and the services
  of interested and able guardians. The world is all before us to do with as we
  will, within the measure of our powers and imaginations. The struggle for
  material existence is over. It has been won. The need for repressions and
  disciplines has passed. The struggle for truth and that indescribable
  necessity which is beauty begins now, unhampered by any of the imperatives of
  the lower struggle. No one now need live less nor be less than his
  utmost.</p>

  <p>"We must respect the race and each other, but that has been made easy for
  us by our upbringing. We must be loyal to the conventions of money, of open
  witness, of responsibility for the public peace and health and decency: these
  are the common obligations of the citizen by which the commonweal is
  sustained. We must contribute our modicum of work to the satisfaction of the
  world's needs. And, for the rest, now WE CAN LIVE. No part of the world, no
  work in the world, no pleasure, except such pleasure as may injure others, is
  denied us. Thanks to you, Heroic Council; thanks beyond limit to

  THE MODERN STATE IN CONTROL OF LIFE</a></h2>

  <h2><a id="chap5_01"
     name="chap5_01">1. &mdash; MONDAY MORNING IN THE<br>
  CREATION OF A NEW WORLD</a></h2>

  <p class="first">With the Declaration of Mégève in 2059 C.E. the Age of
  Frustration, the opening phase of the Era of the Modern State, came to an
  end. Let us recapitulate that history in its barest outline. The World-State
  had appeared dimly and evasively, as an aspiration, as a remote possibility,
  as the suggestion of a League of Nations, during the World War of 1914-18; it
  had gathered experience and definition throughout the decades of collapse and
  disaster; it had formally invaded human politics at the Conference of Basra
  in 1965 as manifestly the only possible solution of the human problem, and
  now it had completed its conquest of mankind.</p>

  <p>The systematic consolidation of that conquest had begun in earnest after
  the Second Conference of Basra in 1978. Then the World Council had set itself
  to certain tasks that had been so inconceivable hitherto that not the most
  daring sociologists had looked them in the face. They had contented
  themselves with pious aspirations, and taken refuge in the persuasion that,
  if they were sufficiently disregarded, these tasks would somehow do
  themselves. They were tasks of profound mental reconstruction, reconstruction
  going deeper into the substratum of the individual life than anything that
  had ever been attempted before. In the first place traditions of nationality
  had to be cleared away for good, and racial prejudice replaced by racial
  understanding. This was a positive job against immense resistances. Next a
  lingua-franca had to be made universal and one or other of the great
  literature-bearing languages rendered accessible to everyone. This again was
  not to be done for the wishing. And thirdly, and most evaded of all three
  obstacles that had to be surmounted, issue had to be joined with the various
  quasi-universal religious and cultural systems, Christianity, Jewry, Islam,
  Buddhism and so forth, which right up to the close of the twentieth century
  were still in active competition with the Modern State movement for the
  direction of the individual life and the control of human affairs. While
  these competing cultures remained in being they were bound to become refuges
  and rallying-shelters for all the opposition forces that set themselves to
  cripple and defeat the new order of the world.</p>

  <p>We have told already how that issue was joined, and shown how necessary it
  was to bring all the moral and intellectual training of the race into direct
  and simple relations with the Modern State organization. After 2020 there is
  no record of any schools being open in the world except the Modern State
  schools. Christianity where it remained sacerdotal and intractable was
  suppressed, but over large parts of the world it was not so much abolished as
  watered down to modernity. Everywhere its endowments had vanished in the
  universal slump; it could find no supply of educated men to sustain its
  ministry; the majority of its churches stood neglected and empty, and when
  the great rebuilding of the world began most of them vanished with all the
  other old edifices that lacked beauty or interest. They were cleared away
  like dead leaves.</p>

  <p>The story of Islam was closely parallel. It went more readily even than
  Christianity because its school organization was weaker. It was pinned very
  closely to the teaching of Arabic. The decadence of that language shattered
  its solidarity much as the disuse of Latin disintegrated Western
  Christianity. It left a few-score beautiful mosques as Christianity left a
  few-score beautiful chapels, churches and cathedrals. And patterns, legends,
  memories remained over in abundance, more gracious and lovely by far than the
  realities from which they were distilled.</p>

  <p>There had been a widespread belief in the tenacity and solidarity of
  Judaism. The Jews had been able to keep themselves a people apart, eating
  peculiar food and following distinctive religious practices, a nation within
  the nation, in every state in the world. They had been a perpetual irritant
  to statesmen, a breach in the collective solidarity everywhere. They had
  played a peculiar in-and-out game of social relationship. One could never
  tell whether a Jew was being a citizen or whether he was being just a Jew.
  They married, they traded preferentially. They had their own standards of
  behaviour. Wherever they abounded their peculiarities aroused bitter
  resentment.</p>

  <p>It might have been supposed that a people so widely dispersed would have
  developed a cosmopolitan mentality and formed a convenient linking
  organization for many world purposes, but their special culture of isolation
  was so intense that this they neither did nor seemed anxious to attempt.
  After the World War the orthodox Jews played but a poor part in the early
  attempts to formulate the Modern State, being far more preoccupied with a
  dream called Zionism, the dream of a fantastic independent state all of their
  own in Palestine, which according to their Babylonian legend was the original
  home of all this synthesis of Semitic-speaking peoples. Only a psycho-analyst
  could begin to tell for what they wanted this Zionist state. It emphasized
  their traditional wilful separation from the main body of mankind. It
  irritated the world against them, subtly and incurably.</p>

  <p>On another score also the unpopularity of Israel intensified in the early
  twentieth century. The core of the slump process was manifestly monetary.
  Something was profoundly rotten with money and credit. The Jews had always
  had and cultivated the reputation of a peculiar understanding and cleverness
  in monetary processes. Yet in the immense difficulties of that time no
  authoritative direction came from the Jews. The leading minds of the time who
  grappled with the intricate problems of monetary reconstruction and
  simplification were almost all Gentiles. It was natural for the common man to
  ask, "Where are the Jews?" It was easy for him to relapse into suspicion and
  persecution. Were they speculating unobtrusively? It was an obvious thing for
  Gentile speculators to shift suspicion to this race which gloried in and
  suffered by its obstinate resolve to remain a "peculiar people".</p>

  <p>And yet between 1940 and 2059, in little more than a century, this
  antiquated obdurate culture disappeared. It and its Zionist state, its kosher
  food, the Law and all the rest of its paraphernalia, were completely merged
  in the human community. The Jews were not suppressed; there was no
  extermination; there were world-wide pogroms during the political and social
  breakdown of the Famished Fifties, but under the Tyranny there was never any
  specific persecution at all; yet they were educated out of their oddity and
  racial egotism in little more than three generations. Their attention was
  distracted from Moses and the Promise to Abraham and the delusion that God
  made his creation for them alone, and they were taught the truth about their
  race. The world is as full as ever it was of men and women of Semitic origin,
  but they belong no more to "Israel".</p>

  <p>This success&mdash;the people of the nineteenth century would have deemed
  it a miracle&mdash;is explicable because of two things. The first of them is
  that the Modern State revolution was from the first educational and only
  secondarily political; it ploughed deeper than any previous revolution. And
  next it came about under new and more favourable conditions. In the
  nineteenth century the family group had ceased to be the effective nucleus in
  either economic or cultural life. And all the odd exclusiveness of the Jew
  had been engendered in his closed and guarded prolific home. There is an
  immense collection of fiction written by Jews for Jews in the early twentieth
  century, in which the relaxation of this immemorial close home-training and
  the clash of the old and modernizing generations is described. The
  dissolution of Israel was beginning even then.</p>

  <p>The task of making the mind of the next generation had been abandoned
  almost unconsciously, for Jew and Gentile alike, to external influences, and
  particularly to the newspaper and the common school. After 1940 this
  supersession of home training was renewed in an extensive form. The Modern
  State movement had from the outset gripped the teachers, re-created popular
  education after the dark decades upon its own lines, and arrested every
  attempt to revive competing schools. Even had he desired it the Jew could no
  longer be peculiar in the food either of his body or his mind.</p>

  <p>The complete solidarity of mankind in 2059, the disappearance of the last
  shadows of dislike and distrust between varied cults, races, and language
  groups, witnesses to the profound truth of what Falaise, one of De Windt's
  editors, has called the Mental Conception of History. The Age of Frustration
  was essentially an age of struggle to achieve certain plainly possible things
  against the resistances of a muddled human mind. The Declaration of Mégève
  was not simply an assertion of victory and freedom for the race, it was the
  demonstration of its achieved lucidity.</p>

  <p>As the curtain of separatist dreams, racial fantasies and hate nightmares
  thinned out and passed away, what was presented to that awakening human
  brain? A little sunlit planet, for its external material, bearing what we now
  realize is not a tithe of its possible flora and fauna, a ball crammed with
  unused and unsuspected resources; and for the internal stuff of that brain
  almost limitless possibilities of mental achievement. All that had been done
  hitherto by man was like the scribbling of a little child before eye and hand
  have learnt sufficient co-ordination to draw. It was like the pawing and
  crawling of a kitten before it begins to see. And now man's eyes were
  open.</p>

  <p>This little planet of which he was now at last in mentally untroubled
  possession was not simply still under-developed and waste; its surface was
  everywhere scarred and disfigured by the long wars he had waged so blindly
  for its mastery. Everywhere in 2059 the scenery of the earth still testified
  to the prolonged war, the state of siege to establish a unified mastery, that
  had now come to an end. If most of the divisions and barriers of the period
  of the sovereign states had disappeared, if there were no longer castles,
  fortifications, boundaries and strategic lines to be traced, there were still
  many indications that the world was under control and still not quite sure of
  its own good behaviour. The carefully planned system of aerodromes to prevent
  any untoward developments of the free private flying that had been tolerated
  after 2040 was such an indication, and so was the strategic import plainly
  underlying the needlessly wide main roads that left no possible region of
  insurrection inaccessible. From the air or on a map it was manifest that the
  world was still "governed". The road system was like a net cast over a
  dangerous beast.</p>

  <p>And equally visible still was the quality of recent conquest in the social
  and economic fields. As Theotocopulos complained, the Second Council overdid
  its embankments. It was distrustful even of the waters of the earth. Its
  reservoirs and rivers had, he says, "a bullied air". If the jostling little
  fields and misshapen ill-proportioned farms, the untidy mines, refuse-heaps,
  factories, workers, slums and hovels and all the dire squalor of competitive
  industrialism had long since disappeared from the spectacle, there was still
  effort visible at every point in the layout of twenty-first-century
  exploitation. The stripping and burning of forests that had devastated the
  world so extensively in the middle decades of the preceding hundred years had
  led to strenuous reafforestation. Strenuous is the word. "Grow," said the
  Council, "and let there be no nonsense about it." At the end of the Age of
  Frustration a tree that was not lined up and lopped and drilled was an
  exception in the landscape.</p>

  <p>Everywhere there was still this suggestion of possible insubordination and
  the sense of an underlying threat. Man had struggled desperately and had won,
  but it was only now that he was finding time to consider any but the most
  immediate and superficial possibilities of his planet.</p>

  <p>The air-view as the dispersing delegates from Mégève saw it forty-seven
  years ago was indeed in the vividest contrast to the world garden in which we
  live to-day. That clumsy rationality, that real dread of aestheticism, that
  had haunted the Council to its end, had made the artificial factors in the
  landscape inelegant and emphatic almost without exception. Bridges and roads
  "got there", as Theotocopulos said, "like charging rhinoceroses". True that
  the disposition to squat forms, which came from the age of the air raids, no
  longer prevailed, but there was a general tendency to make buildings too
  solid and too big; they had sometimes a certain grandiose boldness, but more
  often than not there was a touch of military stupidity in the appearance of
  their piled-up masses. They stood to attention. There was a needlessly lavish
  abundance of pylons, and they were generally too sturdy.</p>

  <p>The enrichment of vegetation which is now world-wide was in operation at
  that time only in a few experimental areas; in most regions there was still
  hardly more forest or cultivation than had existed a century and a half
  before. If the devastation of fellings and fires during the last wars had
  been replaced by the new straight-ruled, squared-out forests, there was as
  yet no perceptible rise in the level of the plant community anywhere; what
  had previously been forest was plantation or forest again, and what had been
  prairie was still prairie, differing only from the grass prairies of older
  days in the dwindling contingent of weeds and wild flowers. In spite of the
  self-complacency of the forestry department of that time, many trees
  distorted by disease survived, and most were by our standards stunted. To
  young eyes to-day this world of our fathers, as they see it in picture book
  and panorama, has not merely a regimented but a barren look, and its
  cultivation seems laborious and poor.</p>

  <p>Yet compared with the landscape of two centuries ago its aspect was
  relatively prosperous, spacious and orderly. There is something very touching
  in the freely expressed response of the nineteenth-century folk to both urban
  and country landscape and to natural scenery generally. They did not dream
  how meagre their descendants were to find the spectacle before them. They
  had, at any rate, as good cloudscapes and sunsets as we have, and such
  natural coast scenery as that of Western Scotland was practically the same
  then as it is to-day. They would endure irksome travel to see sunlit snowy
  mountain masses or get to some viewpoint that caught the rhythm of a distant
  chain. They loved water and woodlands and distant fields in a wide view, and
  towns they admired chiefly as piled up accumulations seen from a distance.
  Also they delighted very greatly in the close brightness of flowering hedges,
  sheets of bluebells, primrose rides, green moss and tendrils and any sort of
  flower. They pick these things out for appreciation so persistently in their
  literature and paintings that it is only with an effort we realize how much
  they were "picked out", and how dull and repetitive were endless miles of
  their normal roads and countryside and how flatly forbidding the ordinary
  aspects of their habitations.</p>

  <p>So far as we can reconstruct it now the prevalent note of the nineteenth
  century scene was weak insipidity, degenerating very easily into a
  distressful mean ungainliness. America was frostbitten in the north and
  slovenly in the south and unkempt everywhere. Happily the shorter-lived, not
  very healthy or vigorous folk of these days had no standards of comparison,
  and actual intimations of discontent with nature and the countryside were
  rare. There is scarcely an admission in nineteenth-century literature that
  the larger part of the natural world was gaunt, unsatisfactory and utterly
  unsympathetic. Writers and poets did not dare to admit as much because they
  had neither the hope nor the energy to make things better. They would not see
  it in obedience to an elementary psychological law.</p>

  <p>But under the Second Council, the criticism not only of man's achievement
  but of natural insufficiency had become voluminous because neither was felt
  any longer to be final. It was not only the heavy engineering, the massive
  buildings and the over-emphasied roadways that those returning delegates
  threatened with their minds. Much of the land was still unsettled. They
  looked down on areas of marsh and scrub, bare wildernesses of rock, rainless
  regions, screes and avalanche slopes. For them as for us it was a world of
  promise still to be fulfilled.</p>

  <p>"Now we can begin on all this," they said. "Now we have really to
  begin."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap5_02"
     name="chap5_02">2. &mdash; KEYING UP THE PLANET</a></h2>

  <p class="first">It had long been known that the vegetation of earth and sea,
  on which the volume and vigour of all other life depends, was not nearly
  commensurate with the available moisture and sunlight. As early as the
  nineteen thirties it was being pointed out by an English economic botanist,
  Frederick Keeble (1870-1975, Collective Works in the Science section of the
  Reprints), that there were delays and arrests in the multiplication of
  diatoms, seasonal grass crops, and other extensive primary vegetable growths,
  arrests due to the fact that while all other conditions were favourable the
  supply of assimilable nitrogen was too slow to keep up the growth process. He
  applied the agricultural lesson of manuring to the whole spectacle of life
  and insisted that we were living in a "nitrogen-starved world". Nitrogen is
  yielded up by the inorganic world to the uses of life with extreme
  reluctance. This observation of Keeble's threw a new light for most people on
  the alleged bounty of nature. Other workers in the same field spread their
  observations to other elements. Carlos Metom (1927-2014), in a striking
  passage, compared life on our planet to "a starveling foal on a barren patch
  that has never learnt to look for green pasture".</p>

  <p>This fundamental poverty of terrestrial existence can be traced through
  most of the geological record. Life has been a stinted thing. There were a
  few periods of exuberance, the period of the Coal Measures for example, when
  life seemed really to pour upward; but for most of recorded time life nibbled
  round the outside of a ball of limitless mineral wealth to which it had no
  key. No individual intelligence could ever penetrate that hidden hoard of
  plenty. It was only when the collective mentality of Science had arisen and
  was going on deathlessly from one clarification to another that a far more
  abundant vegetable basis for animal and human existence came within the range
  of possibility, and only now that the waste of human energy in warfare and
  uncoordinated trading and money-getting was at an end for ever, that the
  realization of that possibility could be attempted. But hundreds of thousands
  of brains are now alight with the prospect of evoking such a plenty and
  wealth of life on our planet as the whole universe had never dreamed of
  before this time.</p>

  <p>The Second Council, in the beginning of its long reign, had not a
  sufficient knowledge of the latent powers of applied biology to anticipate
  this fundamental enrichment of life. It conceived its rôle to be the
  working-out of the logical consequences of mechanical invention during the
  nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The greatest of these consequences were
  the abolition of distance and the supersession of toil by power machinery.
  The goal of the Council was to confirm and establish human unity for ever,
  and to set up a frame of progressive public activities that should provide
  universal employment and universal purchasing power in the face of a
  continually increasing industrial efficiency. At first it was preoccupied by
  the persecuting activities that were needed to secure the world against any
  reaction towards private monopolization, romantic nationalism, religious
  eccentricism, and social fission. Then, as its success in this direction
  passed beyond challenge, as the world community was plainly assured, it found
  itself confronted by an ever more portentous problem of leisure.</p>

  <p>It seemed a natural outlet for the surplus of human energy to provide
  among other things for an enormous development of scientific research and an
  exploration of the deeper mineral resources of the earth's crust. The Council
  assigned something like a third of the resources available for science to
  biological work, and it does not seem to have occurred to these rulers of the
  world, preoccupied as they were with the suppression, the excessive
  suppression, the obliteration even, of deleterious and antiquated separatist
  doctrines and the refashioning of economic life, that this huge growth of
  biological enquiry would result in anything more than the extinction of plant
  and animal diseases, and improvements and economies in cultivation. It was
  outside the range of their imaginations to anticipate a spate of biological
  invention that put the spate of mechanical invention which revolutionized the
  conditions of human life in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries altogether
  in the shade. Biological knowledge outgrew them just as aesthetic sensibility
  outgrew them.</p>

  <p>From the thirties of the twenty-first century onward the conservatism of
  the Second Council had held back an increasing amount of scientific
  discoveries from practical application. The world was unified; it was
  supporting its population (which was being kept well below the modest safety
  line of 2000 million) with absolute ease; its health was at a higher level
  than nature had ever known before; and it was, so far as the powers in being
  could manage it, marking time. It was like an adolescent who is still treated
  as a child. Even the new possibilities of exuberant vegetation were not being
  released. The areas needed for food supply could have been halved before
  2050, but the Council decided that the consequent dislocation of the
  population would be likely to strain social order, and it kept four or five
  million people at the healthy but not very entertaining work of agricultural
  production, while it promoted enquiries for the "industrial application of
  marginal excesses of foodstuffs". It was not only producing, but
  distributing, staples in 2050 on precisely the lines adopted in 2020. It was
  restraining educational developments and innovations in building. It had made
  the world safe for humanity, and it meant to keep the world at that.</p>

  <p>In 2047 Homer Lee Pabst published his remarkable researches on the effect
  upon chromosomes of certain gases derived from the old Sterilizing Inhalation
  made from Permanent Death Gas. These gases are known now as Pabst's
  Kinetogens, and there is a whole series of them. Their general effect is to
  produce mutations of various types. They bring about, abundantly and
  controllably, a variability in life which has hitherto been caused only with
  comparative rarity by cosmic radiations. By 2050 the biological world was
  confronted by a score of absolutely new species of plants and&mdash;queer
  first-fruits in the animal world&mdash; by two new and very destructive
  species of rodent. The artificial evolution of new creatures had come within
  the range of human possibility.</p>

  <p>Limitless possibilities opened before the human imagination. The Council
  gave way to panic. It saw the world it had taken such pains to put in order
  given over to uncontrollable vegetable and animal monstrosities. A nightmare
  of evil weeds and strange beasts dismayed it. Even the human type, it
  realized, was threatened. The laws restraining experiments upon animals were
  extended, and every animal novelty produced by Pabst was to be reported upon
  and destroyed. Plant novelties of decorative or economic value were, however,
  to be tolerated. Within his laboratory and experimental grounds Pabst ignored
  these prohibitions, and the faculty of science increased the endowment of the
  new experimental genetics. And now that the Supreme Council could no longer
  interfere, the Transport and General Distribution Control, the newly
  developed section of the Behaviour Control and the Health Services took up
  Pabst's results and arranged a conference (2060) for their proper
  exploitation. A general plan for the directed evolution of life upon the
  planet was drawn up, a plan which, with various amendments, is in operation
  to this day.</p>

  <p>Most of the "wild beasts" of our ancestors are now under control in their
  special enclosures and reservations. There are fifteen Major Parks of over
  five hundred square miles in which various specially interesting faunas and
  floras flourish without human interference, except for the occasional passage
  of some qualified observer on foot or the transit of a specially licensed
  aeroplane overhead. Adventurous holiday-makers are excluded. The creatures in
  these areas are less affected by man than were their predecessors. They form
  a valuable reserve control of the genetic tentatives that are being made upon
  their more or less captive brethren. The most startling result of these
  experiments is Dumoric's claim to have restored, by means of carefully bred
  crosses and the cultivation of atavistic types, extinct ancestral forms of
  the fallow deer.</p>

  <p>One beneficial result of the preoccupation of the Second Council with the
  problem of employment for idle hands and minds had been the very great
  advances made in both mineralogical and meteorological science. It did not
  realize that the systematic observation of winds and rainfall could possibly
  upset its orderly world. Indeed, the prospect of forbidding the wind to blow
  where it listed was entirely after the Council's heart. So, too, the
  possibility of controlling or drying up volcanoes and earthquakes appealed
  very strongly to it. Before 2000, man's knowledge of the composition of what
  he used to call the earth's "crust" and the mineral resources of the planet
  beneath that crust was extraordinarily superficial. Geologists relied almost
  entirely for their knowledge upon surface features, chance exposures, and
  industrial excavations. But the ever increasing resources available for
  research made a systematic probing and exploration of the deeper layers
  increasingly possible. The student will find in any contemporary textbook of
  Geology an account of the series of beautiful contrivances such as the Shansi
  borer, the Hull and Watkins "diviner," and the Noguchi petrograph, which have
  now made, so to speak, hidden things visible to a depth of twenty-five miles,
  and there too he will find a description of a score of ingenious devices for
  isolating blocks of deep-lying rock and bringing their desirable ingredients
  to the surface. Until a hundred years ago nothing of this sort was even
  imagined. Instead of employing the energy imprisoned underground to drive
  what was needed to the surface, the scanty product of the old-world mines was
  HAULED up by human or mechanical power from above and the ores and coal and
  salt were actually hewn out in situ by hordes of sweating underpaid human
  beings.</p>

  <p>Equally rapid was the progress of meteorology once the Second Council gave
  its mind to that subject. Practical meteorology was of very recent date.
  Except for a little work with the barometer from 1643 onward, forecasting
  began only in the nineteenth century and was not systematically attempted
  until 1850. An infinitesimal tampering with the composition of the air began
  in the early twentieth century. Then man found himself able to withdraw
  nitrogen from it, but this was done only to provide fertilizers, and in such
  small quantities as to make no appreciable effect upon the composition of the
  atmosphere. Little more was attempted until the last war, when the local use
  of substances like the so-called Permanent Death Gas was carried out on a
  sufficiently big scale to amount to a transitory readjustment of the air over
  the region poisoned. Then in the thirties of the twenty-first century there
  was an extensive use of gas on a large scale to destroy locusts, rodents, and
  various insect pests. Considerable enthusiasm was shown at the time, but one
  or two unfortunate accidents cooled the zeal of the Council. It was realized
  that air-mixing for anything but stimulating and purifying purposes must wait
  upon the achievement of wind control. Air-mixing was put back into the
  pigeonholes with a gathering number of other gifts from science that the
  Council deemed premature.</p>

  <p>The Joint Commission for replanning the world found itself therefore with
  three correlated groups of possibility challenging its spirit of adventure. A
  new flora of several thousand species was awaiting release from the
  experimental grounds, and this was only the easiest of the apparently
  limitless possibilities of animal and vegetable variation that experimental
  biology was taking up. A huge and hitherto unsuspected wealth of mineral
  substances was ready to come out of the deep-lying rocks and refresh the
  rather limited and jaded resources of the contemporary soil. And alterations
  in the composition and movements of the atmosphere were no longer
  inaccessibly beyond human effort. The obstruction of individual ownership and
  localized governments had been swept away for ever. In that respect the
  Second Council had beyond question triumphed. But the very vigour with which
  it had done its task for man and the world as they were, and still in effect
  are, had cleared the ground for such an unprecedented inventiveness as is now
  rapidly altering not only the face but the very substance of life.</p>

  <p>The Replanning Commission set about its task with the leisurely energy of
  a body under no stress of necessity. "Life is quite good as it is," runs the
  Introduction to its Draft Plan. "But it is part of the fundamental goodness
  of life that we have as much incessant novelty as we desire at our disposal.
  Due proportion must be our perpetual care. Want of proportion in the
  development of new things was the general cause of the great bulk of human
  suffering and frustration during the past five centuries. We have now an
  organization of controls that can restrain anything like the spasmodic
  mercenary enterprise, without plan or balance, that let loose disaster in the
  early twentieth century. We can afford to look before we leap and measure
  within quite close limits the tale of consequences we set going. In the end
  we may find that there was very considerable justification for the restraint
  put by our Supreme Council upon the immediate application of recent
  inventions, and particularly of recent biological inventions, which might
  otherwise have precipitated very similar but even more fundamental and
  catastrophic disproportions to those which overwhelmed the capitalist
  civilization of the nineteenth century.</p>

  <p>"The particular field in which we propose a continuation of restraint is
  in the application of the rapidly advancing science of genetics to the
  increase of variability so far as human beings, and probably some other of
  the higher mammals, are concerned. We believe that the general feeling of the
  race is against any such experimentation at present. Under the Second Council
  the painless destruction of monsters and the more dreadful and pitiful sorts
  of defective was legalized, and also the sterilization of various types that
  would otherwise have transmitted tendencies that were plainly undesirable.
  This is as far, we think, as humanity should go in directing its racial
  heredity, until our knowledge of behaviour has been greatly amplified. For an
  age or so we can be content with humanity as it now is, humanity no longer
  distressed and driven to cruelty by overcrowding, under-nourishment,
  infections, mental and physical poisons of every sort. There is a rich mine
  of still greatly underdeveloped capacity in the human brain as it is, and
  this we may very happily explore by means of artistic effort, by scientific
  investigations, by living freely and gaily, for the next few generations.
  Normal human life can be cleansed, extended and amplified. With that we
  propose to content ourselves. Even upon this planet we have millions of years
  ahead before there can be any fundamental change in our environment.</p>

  <p>"Directly we turn from humanity to other forms of life it is manifest that
  a most attractive realm is opening to us. We may have new and wonderful
  forests; we may have new plants; we may replace the weedy and scanty
  greensward of the past by a subtler and livelier texture. Undreamt-of fruits
  and blossoms may be summoned out of non-existence. The insect world, on which
  so much of the rest of life depends, may be made more congenial to mankind.
  The smaller fry of life and the little beasts and the birds can be varied now
  until they all come into a tolerable friendship with ourselves. As our hands
  lose their clumsiness we may interfere more and more surely with the balance
  of life. There is no longer fear of abundance now that man is sane.</p>

  <p>"Our planning of human activities for the next few generations will
  involve no fundamental changes at all for humanity. It will be a keying-up of
  the sort of life for which our race, however darkly, confusedly and
  unsuccessfully, has always striven. At present deliberate weather-control is
  too big a task for us, but we believe that a sure weather calendar for a year
  or so ahead is now becoming possible. An immense series of enterprises to
  change the soil, lay-out, vegetation and fauna, first of this region and then
  of that, will necessitate a complete rearrangement of the mines, deep
  quarries, road network and heavy sea transport of the globe. None of this
  need be ugly or repulsive, even in the doing; it can all be made intensely
  interesting. Engineering structure, which was once clumsy and monstrous, is
  now becoming as graceful as a panther. Industrial enterprises that formerly
  befouled the world with smoke, refuse and cinder heaps, are now cleaner in
  their habits than a well-trained cat. The world lay-out of the Second
  Council, designed apparently for a static society, will be to a large extent
  swept aside by our new operations. And no doubt our achievements in their
  turn will give way to still bolder and lovelier enterprises."</p>

  <p>So ran the Introduction to what is known as the Keying-up Plan of 2060.
  To-day we are most of us still immersed in its realization. It has given the
  world occupation without servitude and leisure without boredom. When we have
  had enough of our own work for a time we fly off&mdash;or walk round the
  corner&mdash;to see what other people are doing. The world is full of
  interest and delight, from the forest gardens of the Amazons with their
  sloths, monkeys and occasional pumas and alligators to that playground of the
  world, the snowfields of the Himalayas. We can arrange to take a turn with
  the meteorological observers in the upper air, or tune our lungs for a spell
  in the deep-sea galleries below the rafts of Atlantis. There we can see the
  great cephalopods of the middle levels coming for their food or watch the
  headlong growth of a giant pearl.</p>

  <p>We are already so accustomed to grace, beauty and variety in all the
  details and general forms about us that it is only by turning over the
  pictures and records of seventy years ago that we realize how relatively
  uneventful were the first decades of human unity. At first man seems to have
  been so exhausted by his escape from massacre, disease, economic waste and
  general futility, and so terrified by the thought of any relapse into the old
  confusions, conflicts and economic cannibalism, that he was capable of
  nothing but order. But he gathers courage. It is not only our world that is
  being keyed up, but ourselves.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap5_03"
     name="chap5_03">3. &mdash; GEOGONIC PLANNING</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Among the "deferred projects" that lie behind our current
  activities, and second only to the system of schemes for inducing and
  directing a great increase in human variability, is the complex of plans that
  have been drawn out to alter the terrestrial contours. Here again is
  something far too great and dangerous for our present wisdom, but something
  which it seems inevitable our race will ultimately attempt.</p>

  <p>At present, and for many generations yet, we are still the creatures and
  subjects of geography; the oceans and great mountain chains condition our
  lives. They determine habitats, which again determine the human type best
  adapted to live for the greater part of its life in this or that region.
  Every kind of us, dark or fair, thick-set or slender, black or buff, has its
  own distinctive best place in which to rear its children and work and rest.
  It may roam the earth as it will, but only in certain regions is it
  altogether at home. No type is at home everywhere. There is no universal man.
  A universal type of man would be possible only on a flat and uniform earth.
  There is a necessary variety in humanity which no one now desires to
  diminish.</p>

  <p>But the question the modern geographer puts to us is whether there is not
  a classification of habitats possible into very desirable, desirable,
  undesirable, and inimical, and whether a certain modification of the planet-
  levels operating in conjunction with the restoration of forests now in
  progress would not greatly increase the desirable habitats, by a
  redistribution of rainfall, a change in the fall of the surface waters,
  protection from winds and so forth. A not very considerable rise in the
  Appennines, for instance, would bring them up to the permanent snow-line and
  change the character of the entire Italian peninsula. And an increase in
  desirable habitats may bring with it an increase in the variety of desirable
  human types.</p>

  <p>Yesterday this sort of thing was called "chimerical," to-day it is
  impracticable and unnecessary, because of the volcanic forces that might be
  released. So for the present the geogonist, like the geneticist, must content
  himself with dreams&mdash;in his case dreams of moulding a fire-spouting,
  quivering planet closer to the expanding needs of man. His turn to remodel
  the world will come perhaps in a thousand years or so. There is plenty of
  time for that.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap5_04"
     name="chap5_04">4. &mdash; CHANGES IN THE CONTROL OF BEHAVIOUR</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The past forty-eight years have seen very great
  modifications in the social control of individual behaviour. There has been a
  very great increase in the science, skill and quality of the teachers
  throughout the world, but quite apart from that the character and purpose of
  education and police have changed profoundly.</p>

  <p>Education as we understand it to-day began about the middle of the
  twentieth century. It had only the slenderest continuity with the education
  of the preceding age, just as the education of Christendom had only the
  slenderest continuity with the education of the pagan world. Reading,
  writing, and counting were taught in all three systems, but beyond that the
  very objectives were different. Modern education began as propaganda after
  the time of De Windt, as the propaganda of the Modern State. It sought to
  establish a new complete ideology and a new spirit which would induce the
  individual to devote himself and to shape all his activities to one definite
  purpose, to the attainment and maintenance of a progressive world-socialism,
  using an efficient monetary system as its normal medium of relationship.</p>

  <p>This seemed, and was, a gigantic undertaking. It faced colossal obstacles
  in ordinary human nature. But it was supremely necessary if human
  civilization was to continue. The alternative was a relapse through chaotic
  barbarism to animal casualness and final extinction. Thought and behaviour
  patterns had to be shaped therefore to subserve this objective, to the
  relative disregard of any other conceivable purpose. The Modern State became
  the whole duty of man. This propaganda passed necessarily into a training for
  public service and a universal public education. The Modern State Fellowship
  was a trained body pledged to impose its own type of training upon all the
  world. It proposed to be the New Humanity. It would accept no compromises. It
  made the whole educational framework militant. No other type of school and no
  other system of teaching was tolerated for more than half a century. Never
  before was man so directed and disciplined.</p>

  <p>The educationists of this period of the First Council and the Air
  Dictatorship were particularly sedulous to restrain what they called
  "aberrant motives." Austerity in eating and drinking, hardiness, severity in
  exercise, a jealousy of leisure, and a profound distrust of aesthetic and
  sensuous gratification, and particularly of sexual excitement, marked the
  educational ideals of these men who set out to demodel the world. In the
  early stages of progressive and revolutionary thought in the nineteenth
  century there had been considerable laxity of private conduct. There had been
  a revolt against what was called "Christian morality," and a disposition not
  simply to condone but encourage indulgence in forms that had hitherto been
  prohibited. Most of this "liberalism" in conduct had vanished from
  revolutionary circles by the second or third decade of the twentieth century.
  The Modern State movement, as it developed, was pervaded by a disapproval of
  every sort of sensuous or emotional affection. The business in hand could not
  suffer it. It wasted time; it wasted energy. It let in too much intrigue. It
  undermined the common loyalty. Not even Christianity in its most militant
  stages was so set against the dissipation of energy in this direction. The
  new sexual puritanism differed from the old in its toleration of birth
  control, its disregard of formal marriage, and a certain charity towards the
  first excesses of youth, but it insisted with even greater vigour upon public
  decency and upon the desirability of sexual seriousness, enduring connexions,
  and complete loyalty between lovers. As a result the world was far more
  monogamous, more decorous, and decently busy after 2000 C.E., than it had
  ever been before.</p>

  <p>Many critics to-day are disposed to consider the repressions of that time
  excessive. We are now in a different phase; the militant age is past. They
  allege that there was a vast amount of secret and solitary vice and moral and
  mental distortion beneath the cold surface of things during these disciplined
  years, and they consider that the undeniable harshness and obstinacy of the
  Second Council as it grew old was a direct result of its puritanism. They do
  not hesitate to use such terms as masochist and sadist. But this is by no
  means a unanimous opinion. Equally reputable authorities deny that there was
  any such seething pit of stifled desires and thwarted motives under the
  orderly and healthy activities of the constructive time as this new school
  pretends. In no psychological problem are we still so inadequately informed
  as in the quantitative estimate of sexual impulse and restraint.</p>

  <p>Our investigators work at literature, biographies, diaries, pictorial art,
  police reports in their intricate attempt to recover the vanished mental
  states of these departed generations. There seems to be a sort of rhythm in
  these things. The contrast between present conditions and conditions seventy
  years ago is paralleled in history by the contrast between English social
  life in 1855 and 1925. There also we have a phase of extreme restraint and
  decorum giving way to one of remarkable freedom. We can trace every phase.
  Every phase is amply documented. There are not the slightest grounds for
  supposing that the earlier period was one of intense nervous strain and
  misery. There was a general absence of vivid excitation, and the sexual life
  flowed along in an orderly fashion. It did not get into politics or the
  control of businesses. It appears in plays and novels like a tame animal
  which is not to be made too much of. It goes out of the room whenever
  necessary. By comparison England in 1920 was out for everything it could do
  sexually. It did everything and boasted about it and incited the young. As
  the gravity of economic and political problems increased and the structural
  unsoundness of the world became more manifest, sexual preoccupations seem to
  have afforded a sort of refuge from the mental strain demanded by the
  struggle. People distracted themselves from the immense demands of the
  situation by making a great noise about the intensifications and aberrations
  of the personal life. There was a real propaganda of drugs and homosexuality
  among the clever young. Literature, always so responsive to its audience,
  stood on its head and displayed its private parts. It produced a vast amount
  of solemn pornography, facetious pornography, sadistic incitement,
  re-sexualized religiosity and verbal gibbering in which the rich
  effectiveness of obscene words was abundantly exploited. It is all available
  for the reader to-day who cares to examine it. He will find it neither
  shocking, disgusting, exciting or interesting. He will find it comically
  pretentious and pitifully silly.</p>

  <p>It is small wonder that the scattered workers for the Modern State, who
  were struggling heroically with the huge problems of social dislocation and
  social reconstruction, developed an antipathy against these aesthetic and
  sexual preoccupations which robbed them of the help and service of so many
  hopeful youngsters. The Modern State Movement was unobtrusively puritanical
  from the outset. After the romantic lapses of the First World Council it
  became oppressively puritanical.</p>

  <p>It was the precedent of the moral disorder of the early twentieth century
  to which the Educational Control appealed, a hundred and twenty years later,
  to justify its sustained regulation of private morals and repression of
  stimulation. It failed to realize the profound difference of the new
  conditions. The florid ebullition of sexual troubles, sexual refinements and
  sexual grossnesses in the Age of Frustration had been a natural consequence
  of frustration. Everywhere in the face of challenges too huge to face, rich
  and poor alike found themselves aimless, unoccupied, menaced. Ill health was
  increasing. Drugs, alcohol and sex were available to excite and soothe and
  deaden their distressed nerves. Good-looking youth, which could not sell its
  brains or labour, could still find a market for its person. About every
  nucleus of unjustly acquired wealth or demoralized power prostitution and
  parasitism festered. What else was there to do in that ugly, unhappy and
  dangerous world? But the world of 2040 was a busy, keenly interested and
  healthy world again.</p>

  <p>We cannot detail in this general review of history the reluctant lifting
  of one prohibition after another. We may now go naked, love as we like, eat,
  drink and amuse ourselves with our work or as we will, subject only to a
  proper respect for unformed minds. And no harm has been done at all. When the
  Puritanical Tyranny began, its directors felt they had imprisoned a tiger
  that would otherwise consume all the plenty and safety they achieved. Very
  reluctantly indeed, bit by bit and after endless disputes, were their
  prohibitions relaxed. And no tiger appeared. Properly nourished people do not
  take to gluttony, properly interested people are not overwhelmed by sex.
  Instead of a tiger appeared a harmless, quiet, unobtrusive and not unpleasing
  pussy-cat, which declined to be in any way notable.</p>

  <p>Humanity was changing. The threatened outbreak of pornography, abnormality
  and sex excitation did not occur. But anyone who studies the fiction and
  drama of the past half-century and compares it with the similar literature of
  the old world will realize that there are far more personal love and far more
  happy lovers than ever before, and that physical love to demonstrate loyalty,
  show preference, enrich association and seal friendship was never so direct
  and beautiful. Jealousy we have, but it is rarely malicious; desire, but it
  is rarely vicious. In this as in so many other things progress has meant
  simplification. The souls we read about of two centuries ago strike us as
  grotesquely tangled, tormented and nasty souls. Hate mingled with their
  desires; mercenary considerations were an ever present defilement; they
  paired dishonestly and mated insincerely.</p>

  <p>But while there has been this release from the strait-laced sexual morals
  of the militant period, in another field there has been no relaxation. The
  new order can tolerate no tampering with the monetary-property system that
  holds us all together. Not only is our police incessantly alert against
  robbery and cheating as the old world understood it, but many gainful
  practices that 1920 would have considered tolerable or even admirable are
  suppressed, and are likely to be suppressed for all time. Gambling, the mean
  desire and device to get the spending of someone else's earnings, is punished
  as heavily as the forgery of money checks; and all those speculative
  activities which seemed to be the very texture of the nineteenth-century
  social order dare not reappear now in any disguise at all. Money is a check
  for our personal needs, or for the giving of graceful presents. There must be
  no misuse of money to gain an advantage over another human being, even with
  that other human being's connivance. There we are still bound. That sort of
  thing is the vice of cannibalism. Beyond that liberty increases daily.</p>

  <p>With a sound education of mind and body and a rigorous and exact
  protection of property and money from dishonourable impulses, we have found
  that it is possible to give every human being such a liberty of movement and
  general behaviour as would have seemed incredible to those militant
  socialists who ruled the world during the earlier decades of the last
  century. But it is just because of their stern and thorough cleansing of
  human life that we can now live in freedom. We may go anywhere in the world
  now, we may do practically anything that we can possibly desire to do.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap5_05"
     name="chap5_05">5. &mdash; ORGANIZATION OF PLENTY</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Just as it becomes increasingly difficult for the teacher of
  history to convey to each new generation what human feelings and motives were
  like in a world of morbid infections and unwholesome bodily habits or in a
  heavily sentimentalized atmosphere of general distrust and insecurity, so
  also he has to make a most vigorous imaginative effort to recover even the
  faintest shadow of the pervading vexation, humiliations and straining anxiety
  that resulted from an almost universal deficiency of common things.
  Everybody, except a small minority, went short until the close of the
  twentieth century. Even the rich had to be wary cunning buyers to satisfy all
  their fancies and desires. The simplified economic order of our world to-day
  runs so smoothly that we hardly think at all about our ordinary needs.
  Housing, food and clothing wait upon us wherever we go. It is so easily done
  that we fail to realize the immense cleansing away of obstructive
  difficulties that had to occur before it could be made so easy.</p>

  <p>One of the results of abundance that our ancestors would have found
  paradoxical is the abolition of encumbrance. But the less there was in the
  past the more you had to have and hold. Men had to appropriate things because
  there was not enough to go round. Your home was not simply the place to which
  you retired for solitude or intimacy; it was a store house. In the sixteenth
  or seventeenth century it was even fortified by bars, locks and bolts against
  robbers. You got with difficulty, and what you got you kept. The successful
  man of those days was imprisoned and smothered in accumulations upon which he
  dared not relax his watchfulness and grip. They were as indestructible as he
  could make them, for once destroyed or ignored they might prove
  irreplaceable. Everybody was keeping things, keeping them rather than using
  them. If they were not wanted now they might be wanted presently. If that
  successful man desired to vary his urban life he had to possess a country
  house. In these establishments there had to be a miniature social economy.
  Much of the food was not only prepared in the personal household, but
  produced on the private estate. All this had to be managed and watched to
  prevent waste, slackness and dishonesty. All the clothes the prosperous man
  might want to wear had to be stored and preserved in presses and wardrobes;
  his household needed gear against any possible emergency; and all his
  accumulations had to be guarded against robbers. It was almost as anxious and
  wearing a job to be rich as to be poor in those days of general
  insufficiency. And if the rich man travelled, he had to travel in his own
  coach with his attendants, taking a great burthen of clothing and general
  luggage with him.</p>

  <p>In the relatively plentiful days of the later nineteenth century, which in
  so many details foreshadowed and yet failed to complete and generalize the
  conditions of our own time, there was for the prosperous at least a certain
  alleviation of the burthen of property. The temporary achievement of a
  limited cosmopolitanism of money and credit, the multiplication of the
  bourgeoisie, the liquidation of ownership by joint-stock undertakings, the
  increased facilities for communication and movement, made successful people
  less disposed to sit down amidst their possessions. There was a sustained
  general effort, which we now find grotesque and irrational, to keep property
  and at the same time not to be bothered by property. The ideal of success was
  no longer concrete ownership but purchasing power. Houses, furnishings and so
  forth changed hands with increased readiness.</p>

  <p>Instead of living in great complete houses and dining at home, people
  lived in smaller houses or flats and dined in collective dining-rooms or
  restaurants. They gave up having country houses of their own and travelled
  freely and variously, evoking a vast industry of hotels and hired villas.
  They travelled lighter&mdash;in comparison with preceding centuries, that is.
  As retail trade organized itself upon big-business lines, the need for the
  private storage of gear diminished. People bought things when they wanted
  them, because now they could do so. The big "stores" of the early twentieth
  century carried an enormous and greatly varied stock.</p>

  <p>In the days of Shakespeare new clothes, new furniture, new houses, new
  things of all sorts were infrequent; in the early twentieth century there
  were already intimations of the general fresh newness of our own times. The
  facilities for scrapping were still poorly developed, and there was much
  congestion and endless litter about, but renewal and replacement for those
  who had purchasing power were already well developed. If it had not been for
  the social catastrophe due to ignorance, individualism, monetary deflation
  and nationalism that overwhelmed that phase of civilization, the distributing
  organization of the world might very probably have developed straight on from
  the system of linked stores as it flourished in America in 1925 to our
  present conditions. And similarly there was an expansion of hotel life and a
  belated beginning of portable country houses, clearly foreshadowing our
  current arrangements.</p>

  <p>After the disasters and new beginnings of the middle decades of the
  twentieth century it was to the patterns of big business at the close of the
  First Age of Abundance that the direction of the Transport Union recurred. We
  have told how easily and necessarily that Union became the trading monopoly
  and finally, as the Air and Sea Control, the actual government of the
  renascent world. Its counting-houses issuing and receiving its energy notes
  became the New Banking; its Trading Council became the New Retailing; its
  Supply Control took over, at last, the productive activities of the world.
  From the first the new powers were instinct with the idea of mobility. They
  had no vestiges in their composition of the skimping and saving traditions of
  the ages of insufficiency. They set about providing as ample and various
  accommodation for everybody as the ever-increasing production of the planet
  permitted.</p>

  <p>The great distributing stores of the previous age provided the patterns
  from which the new distribution developed in that age of recovery. Wherever
  old towns and cities were being reconstructed or new ones appearing about new
  centres of productive activity the architects of the Air and Sea Control
  erected their great establishments, at first big and handsome after the old
  fashion and then more finely planned. At first these stores sold things
  according to the old method, then gradually in regard to a number of things,
  to clothing for example, they organized the modern system of exchanging new
  things for old; the new shoes or garment would be made and fitted to the
  customer and the old taken away and pulped or otherwise disposed of. Nothing
  is cobbled nowadays; nothing is patched or repaired. By degrees this method
  abolished that ancient institution the laundry altogether. That line of
  fluttering patched and tattered garments so characteristic of old-world
  village scenery vanished from the earth. New rapid methods of measuring and
  fitting replaced the tape, scissors and sewing of the old days. In the time
  of the Hoover Slump men would wear their underclothes for years, having them
  painfully washed out, dried, ironed and returned weekly, and they would wear
  their complex outer garments with all the old fastenings, buttons, straps,
  buckles and so forth, sometimes for many years. They had to be made of dark
  fabrics with broken patterns to conceal their griminess. The clothing of the
  Middle Ages was still filthier. Nowadays the average life of our much simpler
  and brighter outer garments with their convenient zip fastenings is about a
  week, and such light underclothes as we wear last about three days. We keep
  no wardrobes of them; the stores are our wardrobes. If the weather changes
  the stores are ready for us everywhere with wraps or heavier or lighter
  materials. It must be a remote expedition indeed that needs a change of
  raiment. We wear less clothing than our ancestors, partly because of our
  healthier condition, partly because we do not like to hide lovely bodies, but
  mainly because in the past men wrapped themselves up against every
  contingency. They wore hats whenever they were not under a roof, socks inside
  their boots, buttons on their sleeve-cuffs, collars and ties. It seems as
  though these elaborations became necessary to social prestige because of the
  general shortage. In an age of scarcity it was a testimonial to one's worth
  to be fully clad. In the nineteenth century the well-to-do wore gold
  watch-chains and gloves, which they carried in their hands in hot weather, as
  further evidence of substantial means.</p>

  <p>Housing again, under the Air and Sea Control, took off from the point
  where the hotel-flat had left it in 1930. There was never any attempt to
  resume the building of those small permanent houses which were spread so
  abundantly over England, for example, after the World War. The first task of
  the new world control was mainly sanitary. Infection lurked everywhere; four
  decades of social disorder had made every building a decaying disease-trap
  for the young that were born into it. The Housing Control rebuilt the housing
  quarters of the rotten old towns in the form of blocks of dwellings, clean,
  spacious and convenient, but, to our eyes now, very squat and dull. They went
  from ten to twelve stories high, and very soundly and honestly made.
  Everywhere they had water, lighting, heating in the colder climates, and
  sanitation. The picturesquely clustering rural villages were replaced all
  over the earth by the same type of concentrated house-block, the style and
  material varying only so far as conditions of climate required it. The
  villages were literally swept up into these piles. Even where small private
  cultivation was still going on, the concentration into these mansions
  occurred and the peasants bicycled out to their properties. Every block had
  its crèche, its school, its store and its general meeting-rooms.</p>

  <p>As we look back on it this supersession of the single separate unlit,
  undrained and waterless hut or hovel, cottage or little steading seems to
  have been a swift business, but in reality it took from 1980 to 2030, much
  more than half the average lifetime, to spread this new conception of housing
  over most of the world, and by that time in the more advanced regions the
  older blocks were already being replaced by more beautiful and convenient
  creations.</p>

  <p>Historical Pictures shows us the whole process. We see the jumbling
  growths of the early phase of the twentieth century; towering
  apartment-houses and hotels struggling up, far above the churches, mosques,
  pagodas and public buildings, out of a dense undergrowth of slums. Then come
  arrest and decline. The pictures become as full of ruins, sheds and makeshift
  buildings as the drawings of Albrecht Dürer. Amidst these appear air-raid
  shelters with their beetling covers, first-aid pillars with their chequered
  markings, and anti-aircraft forts. Further ruin ensues and we see life
  disorganized by the Great Plague.</p>

  <p>Then suddenly these stout, squat, virtuous new blocks thrust into the
  scene and the battered past vanishes. A new Age has begun. The towns grow
  larger, finer and more varied. The housing blocks are grouped with the
  expanding stores, public clubs and hotels in parks and gardens near to the
  aerodrome, and convenient for whatever industry gives the agglomeration its
  importance. The public club became prominent after C.E. 2000, both
  architecturally and socially. That again was the revival of two old ideas; it
  was a combination of the idea of the English or American club with the idea
  of the Baths to which the Roman citizens resorted. Here from the start were
  grouped the gymnastic and sports halls, dancing-floors, conference rooms, the
  perpetual news cinema, libraries, reading-rooms, small studies, studios and
  social centres of the reviving social life.</p>

  <p>The twenty-first century rediscovered an experience of the nineteenth and
  of the first centuries of the Christian Era, a discovery that was also made
  by Alexander the Great, that it is much easier to build great modern cities
  in new places than to modernize the old centres of activity. And the more
  vital these old centres remained the more difficult was their reconstruction,
  because it meant the interruption and transfer of important activities to new
  quarters. New York was typical of this lag in rebuilding. Up to quite
  recently Lower New York has been the most old-fashioned city in the world,
  unique in its gloomy antiquity. The last of the ancient skyscrapers, the
  Empire State Building, is even now under demolition in C.E. 2106!</p>

  <p>This was not because New York has fallen out of things, but, on the
  contrary, because it was in the van of the new movement. We have already
  quoted Nicholson's account of its reviving importance in 1960. A year or so
  later it became the headquarters of the American branch of the Sea and Air
  Control, a western equivalent to Basra. The swiftly expanding activities of
  the new government needed immediate housing, and the gaunt surviving piles of
  Lower New York were adapted hastily to its accommodation. This kept them
  going for a time, and then arose a prolonged controversy between rival
  schools of planning for the reconstruction of that strangely vital city. It
  is not only true that the poorer the world was the more it was encumbered by
  property, but also that the more vigorously a place or a building is being
  used in progressive work the more difficult it is to keep it up to date.</p>

  <p>Since the middle of the twenty-first century there has been a world-wide
  reappearance of the individual home, more particularly on the countryside, by
  the sea, and amidst forests and mountain scenery. But it has reappeared in a
  new form. It is not really the same thing as the old cottage and country
  house.</p>

  <p>The idea of a home made of portable material, constructed at some
  convenient industrial centre and sent to any desired site, was already in the
  minds of such restless innovators as Henry Ford before the Decline and Fall.
  The country college, the country house, is an imaginative outlet. For great
  numbers of men and women comes a phase when the desire for that little
  peculiar place, with its carefully chosen site, its distinctive long-coveted
  amenities, its outlet upon the woods, the mountain, the jungle or the sea,
  has an overpowering appeal. There they will live, dream, work and be happy.
  Few of the many who had that dream could satisfy it in the old days. Some
  rare, rich persons were able to buy land, build elaborately after their
  desires, make gardens. When they died or became bankrupt other people without
  the leisure to make their own homes bought the abandoned home. They would far
  rather have made a place for themselves, but there stood the predecessor's
  desire in brick or stone, solid and irremovable, and they did what they
  could, by means of alterations, to eliminate the taste of him.</p>

  <p>But as plenty and mechanical power increased, as the new road system made
  more and more of the earth accessible, as power-cables and water supply
  spread everywhere, it became easy not only to clear away and obliterate the
  traces of houses that were done for, but to bring a pleasant individualized
  country house within the purchasing power of an increasing proportion of the
  population. The mastery of power in our time is manifested almost as much by
  its swift scrapping and scavenging as by its limitless productivity. Nowadays
  a man or woman may hit upon an unoccupied site, spend a few pleasant weeks
  planning and revising projects and designs, and give his order. In a month
  his home is ready, in a day or so more the foundation has been laid, and in
  three or four weeks the dream is realized; the house stands as he wished it
  to stand, connected to the power mains, supplied with water, furnished to his
  taste smiling and ready. It is hardly more trouble than ordering an aeroplane
  or an automobile.</p>

  <p>In its earlier stages the evocation of the preconstructed house was not so
  rapid, but from the first it was far quicker than the laborious piling up of
  the old-world builder.</p>

  <p>And with an equal facility now a house is cleared away. We no longer think
  it meet to wear another man's abandoned house any more than we think it
  proper to wear the clothes of the dead. Clearing away, says Michael Kemal, is
  the primary characteristic of the Modern Age. The Age of Frustration was
  essentially an age that could not clear away, either debts, sovereignties,
  patriotisms, old classes, old boundaries, old buildings, old scores or old
  grievances. It is only in the past century that man has learnt the real
  lesson of plenty, that far more important than getting things is getting rid
  of things. We are rich universally because we are no longer rich
  personally.</p>

  <p>We have mentioned the travelling wealthy man of the seventeenth century,
  for then only the wealthy aristocrats could travel freely, and we have
  glanced at the cumbersome impedimenta of his voyage. Compare him with any
  ordinary man today who decides to take a holiday and go to the ends of the
  earth. He may arrange with a travel bureau overnight for one or two special
  accommodations, then off he goes in the clothes he wears. He takes a wallet
  with his money account, his identification papers and perhaps a memorandum
  book. He may wear, as many people do, a personal ornament or so that has
  taken a hold upon his imagination. He may carry something to read or a
  specimen he wants to show. Whatever else he is likely to want on his way he
  will find on his way. He needs no other possessions because his possessions
  are everywhere. We have solved the problem of socializing property, the
  problem the early twentieth century was unable to solve. We have the use and
  consumption of material goods without the burthen of ownership.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap5_06"
     name="chap5_06">6. &mdash; THE AVERAGE MAN GROWS OLDER AND WISER</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The numbers and the quality of the human population have
  changed very greatly in the past two centuries. Always these things have
  varied; every animal and vegetable species fluctuates continually in the
  numbers and quality of its individuals; but it is only recently that these
  movements have been recorded and examined systematically. The
  anti-progressives of the early twentieth century loved to assert that "human
  nature" never altered; to imagine that the men of the Stone Age felt and
  thought like bank clerks picnicking in a cave, and that the ideas of
  Confucius and Buddha were easily interchangeable with the ideas of Rousseau,
  Karl Marx or De Windt. They were not simply ignorant but misinformed about
  almost every essential fact in the past experiences and present situation of
  the race. Only when the twenty-first century was well under way did any
  consciousness of the primary operating forces in human biology appear in the
  discussion and conduct of world affairs.</p>

  <p>In the year 1800 the total population of the world was under 900 millions,
  and the average age was about 22. In 1900 the population had doubled and the
  average age had risen by nearly ten years. In 1935 a maximum was attained of
  2000 millions and the average age had mounted to nearly 40. In a hundred
  years the facilities for intercommunication and physical reaction had
  increased beyond all measure. But the statesmen, educators and lawyers of
  that age, as we have shown very plainly in this history, were unaware of any
  of these differences that had occurred since their methods were developed.
  They drooled along according to precedent. A set-back for adjustment was
  therefore inevitable. We have told the broad facts of the crash that began
  with the war massacres of 1914-18 and culminated in the cycle of pestilences
  before 1957. In thirty years the population of the earth fell to about one
  thousand millions or less, and the average age receded to something about 23.
  This was a stupendous recession, not merely in numbers but in the maturity of
  the average mind.</p>

  <p>Then came the Air and Sea Control and the First and the Second Council
  with their restoration of hygienic conditions and their scientific planning.
  The increase of population was watched and restrained for a century, but the
  average age extended until now it is 62 and still rising. The population
  total crept back to 1500 millions in 2060 and reached 2000 millions again in
  2085. It has become manifest that such a population is no longer unwieldy,
  and that with the scientific education and behaviour control we now possess a
  considerable further increase can be contemplated without dismay.</p>

  <p>The population of the earth is now 2500 millions, and it will probably be
  let up to 4000 millions as rapidly as the world is keyed up for its full
  support and happiness. The danger of such a population swarming dangerously
  or getting into panics, mental jams, crushes and insanitary congestions grows
  less and less. The opinion of contemporary authorities is that 4000 millions
  is an optimum, and that before many decades have passed it will be possible
  to keep most of those born actively and happily alive to something like 90
  years of age. But the question of the possibility and advisability of
  prolonging the individual life more than three or four decades beyond the
  "threescore and ten" of the Biblical barbarian is still an open one. It is
  possible that there is a limit to the memories a brain can carry and to its
  power of taking new interest in fresh events. There may be a natural death
  for most people in the future about the age of a hundred or a little more, as
  painless and acceptable as going to bed and sleeping after a long and
  interesting day.</p>

  <p>These quantitative biological alterations involve the profoundest
  differences in the quality of every life concerned. It is not simply that
  each individual has now a justifiable faith that he will live out his life to
  the end, but that the conditions in which he lives call out quite a different
  reaction system from that evoked in the past. Before the Middle Ages people
  thought of their grandparents as older and mightier people, but we think of
  our ancestors as younger and feebler people. Those earlier generations were
  like fresh-water fish, living in shallow, saline and readily dried-up water,
  in comparison with others of the same species living in a deep, abundant,
  well-aerated and altogether congenial lake. They were continually
  uncomfortable, constantly stranded by circumstances; they flapped about
  wildly and died early. Although they were the same in essence, their
  behaviour, their very movements, were like the behaviour of a different
  species of being.</p>

  <p>Consider the existence of a young man in Shakespeare's time. If he did not
  die young he aged rapidly. He would be heavy, old and pompous at forty. A
  swarm of ailments lay in wait for him to emphasize and accelerate his decay.
  Youth was stuff that would not endure. The beauty and vitality of women were
  even more evanescent. So they snatched at love and adventure. The world was
  full of Romeos and Juliets at the crest of their passionate lives in their
  teens, who nowadays would be in the college stage of education, a score of
  years away from any conclusive drama. The literature of the time witnesses to
  a universal normal swift transitoriness. The simple precipitate love story,
  the jealousy, the headlong revenge and so on makes the substances of drama,
  romance and poem. That and the grab at spendable wealth: El Dorado, treasure
  trove or robbery attempted and defeated. A career was made or marred by a
  week's folly, and there was little time to recover it before the end. It is
  extraordinarily interesting to note all the things in life that are left out
  by the Elizabethan literature, and so to measure that smaller brighter circle
  of interest in that age.</p>

  <p>The changing biological conditions between 1840 and 1940 mirror themselves
  faithfully in the art and reading of the decades. The novel, which is at
  first pervaded by a gay hello to life, which accepts everything as cheerfully
  as a young animal, which laughs, caricatures and incites, becomes reflective,
  analytical, purposeful. Life no longer ends at the first rush. The proportion
  of novels to other books diminishes. The penetration of the individual
  consciousness by the great social and economic processes that were going on
  becomes more and more evident. When literature revived at the close of the
  twentieth century it was an adult literature, expressing the mentality of
  readers and writers who were fully grown men and women in a planning world
  that had ceased to be accidental and incoherent. In the novel as it then
  reappeared there is much more about personal love and the interplay of
  character, but far less (and the proportion continues to diminish) about the
  primary love adventure.</p>

  <p>That diminution of haste and avidity, of the quick egotism and swift
  uncritical judgment of youth, still continues. The deliberation, serenity and
  breadth of reference in the normal life increase. The years from thirty to
  seventy were formerly a sort of dump for the consequences of the first three
  decades; now they are the main part of life, the years of work, expression
  and complete self-discovery, to which these earlier stages are the bright,
  delightful prelude. There was a time when the man or woman over forty felt
  something of a survivor; he was "staying on"; relatively the world swarmed
  with youth, with the swiftness, rivalries and shallowness of youth: the
  fitness of the ill-protected body had gone already; the elderly people who
  were "getting on for fifty" moved slowly and had duller if sounder
  apprehensions. But now most of us are in the graver years with our bodies and
  apprehensions unimpaired, and there is no longer the same effect of being
  rather in the way of a juvenile treat. The juvenile treat, the age when even
  the old aped the young, ended in the World War and the economic collapse.
  After that came a struggle, at first unconscious and then open and declared,
  between youth and mental maturity.</p>

  <p>In the bad years after the World War for a couple of generations there was
  a very unhappy relapse towards youthful predominance. The old people had
  failed to avert the collapse, the legitimate seniors for the new period were
  dead and broken and morally disorganized, and there was a sort of poetic
  justice in the stormy release of puerility that ensued. Italy was scourged by
  its hobbledehoys in black shirts; Russia was ruled by the blue-chinned Young;
  Ireland was devastated by hooligan patriots; presently Germany, after
  brooding over its defeat for ten years, had a convulsive relapse to fiercely
  crazy boyishness in the Nazis. Indian patriotism had a kindred immaturity.
  The tender years of many of the young revolutionaries executed by the
  British, outrage our standards of toleration. Everywhere was youthful
  ignorance with lethal weapons in its hands, conceited, self-righteous,
  exalted, blind to the tale of consequences. Breaking up things is the
  disposition of youth, and making is not yet in its experience. Liberalism and
  the middle-aged had a phase of unprecedented ineffectiveness. There seemed to
  be no judgment left in the world, and the young, in masks and requisitioned
  cars, making nocturnal raids, indulging in punitive cruelties, beating,
  torturing, displaying in equal measure physical recklessness and moral panic,
  came near to wrecking the whole civilizing process.</p>

  <p>It is an interesting task to trace the gradual maturing of these
  adolescent organizers that seized so much of the control of the world in that
  age of transitional disorder. There are voluminous books in which Fascism in
  1920, Fascism in 1930, and Fascism in 1940, or again Communism in the same
  decades, is elaborately compared with itself. After all their impatience and
  sentimentality, their rank patriotism and reactionary cant, we find these
  youth movements unobtrusively sneaking back to planning, discipline, and
  scientific methods. Millions of young men who began Fascist, Nazi, Communist
  and the like, blind nationalists and irrational partisans, became Modern
  State men in their middle years. They became at last instruments to realize
  the plans and visions of the very men they had hunted, maltreated and
  murdered in the crude zeal of their first beginnings.</p>

  <p>But now youth is well in hand for ever, and when we speak of a man to-day
  we really mean a different being from a nineteenth-century man. Bodily he is
  sounder and fitter, almost completely free from disease; mentally he is clear
  and clean and educated to a pitch that was still undreamt of two centuries
  ago. He is over fifty instead of being under thirty. He is less gregarious in
  his instincts and less suggestible because he is further away from the "home
  and litter" mentality, but he is far more social and unselfish in his
  ideology and mental habits. He is, in fact, for all the identity of his
  heredity, a different animal. He is bigger and stronger, more clear-headed,
  with more self-control and more definitely related to his fellow
  creatures.</p>

  <p>This is manifest everywhere, but it is particularly visible in such
  regions as Bengal and Central China. There we find the direct descendants of
  shrill, unhappy, swarming, degenerate, undernourished, under-educated,
  underbred and short-lived populations among the finest, handsomest, longest-
  lived and ablest of contemporary humanity. This has been achieved without any
  attempt at Positive Eugenics; it has resulted from the honest application of
  the Obvious to health, education, and economic organization, within little
  more than a hundred years. These populations were terribly weeded by the
  pestilences of the age of disorder and grimly disciplined by the Tyranny.
  They are now, after that pruning and training bearing as fine flowers of
  literary and scientific achievement as any other racial masses.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap5_07"
     name="chap5_07">7. &mdash; LANGUAGE AND MENTAL GROWTH</a></h2>

  <p class="first">(I print this section exactly as Raven wrote it down. It is,
  the reader will remark, in very ordinary twentieth-century English. Yet
  plainly if it is a part of a twenty-second-century textbook of general
  history it cannot have been written originally in our contemporary idiom. It
  insists upon a refinement and enlargement of language as if it had already
  occurred, but no such refinement is evident. It must have been translated by
  Raven as he dreamt it into the prose of to-day. If he saw that book of his at
  all, he saw it not with his eyes but with his mind. The actual page could
  have had neither our lettering, our spelling, our phrasing nor our
  vocabulary.)</p>

  <p>One of the unanticipated achievements of the twenty-first century was the
  rapid diffusion of Basic English as the lingua franca of the world and the
  even more rapid modification, expansion and spread of English in its wake.
  The English most of us speak and write today is a very different tongue from
  the English of Shakespeare, Addison, Bunyan or Shaw; it has shed the last
  traces of such archaic elaborations as a subjunctive mood; it has simplified
  its spelling, standardized its pronunciation, adopted many foreign locutions,
  and naturalized and assimilated thousands of foreign words. No deliberate
  attempt was made to establish it as the world language. It had many natural
  advantages over its chief competitors, Spanish, French, Russian, German and
  Italian. It was simpler, subtler, more flexible and already more widely
  spoken, but it was certainly the use of Basic English which gave it its final
  victory over these rivals.</p>

  <p>Basic English was the invention of an ingenious scholar of Cambridge in
  England, C. K. Ogden (1889-1990), who devoted a long and industrious life to
  the simplification of expression and particularly to this particular
  simplification. It is interesting to note that he was a contemporary of James
  Joyce (1882-1955), who also devoted himself to the task of devising a new
  sort of English. But while Ogden sought scientific simplification, Joyce
  worked aesthetically for elaboration and rich suggestion, and vanished at
  last from the pursuit of his dwindling pack of readers in a tangled prose
  almost indistinguishable from the gibbering of a lunatic. Nevertheless he
  added about twenty-five words to the language which are still in use. Ogden,
  after long and industrious experimentation in the reverse direction, emerged
  with an English of 850 words and a few rules of construction which would
  enable any foreigner to express practically any ordinary idea simply and
  clearly. It became possible for an intelligent foreigner to talk or
  correspond in understandable English in a few weeks. On the whole it was more
  difficult to train English speakers to restrict themselves to the forms and
  words selected than to teach outsiders the whole of Basic. It was a teacher
  of languages, Rudolph Boyle (1910-1959), who contrived the method by which
  English speakers learnt to confine themselves, when necessary, to Basic
  limitations.</p>

  <p>This convenience spread like wildfire after the First Conference of Basra.
  It was made the official medium of communication throughout the world by the
  Air and Sea Control, and by 2020 there was hardly anyone in the world who
  could not talk and understand it.</p>

  <p>It is from phonetically spelt Basic English as a new starting-point that
  the language we write and speak to-day developed, chiefly by the gradual
  resumption of verbs and idioms from the mother tongue and by the assimilation
  of foreign terms and phrases. We speak a language of nearly two million words
  nowadays, a synthetic language in fact, into which roots, words and idioms
  from every speech in the world have been poured. K. Wang in a recent essay
  has shown that there are still specializations of vocabulary. The vocabulary
  of a score of recent writers of Italian origin chosen haphazard shows a
  marked preference for words derived from the Latin, in comparison with twenty
  Eastern Asiatic writers whose bias is Chinese and American. Yet they can all
  understand one another and they are all in one undivided cultural field.</p>

  <p>There are few redundancies in the new English of today and tomorrow, and
  there is an increasing disposition to take synonyms, and what used to be
  classified as "rare" or "obsolete" terms, and re-define them to convey some
  finer shade of meaning. Criticism, in the form of the Dictionary Bureau,
  scrutinizes, but permits desirable additions. One can feel little doubt about
  the increasing delicacy and precision of expression to-day if we compare a
  contemporary book with some English classic of the eighteenth or nineteenth
  century. That is still quite understandable to us, but in its bareness and
  occasional ineptitudes it seems halfway back to the limitations and
  lumberingness of Early English or Gothic.</p>

  <p>The fuller the terminology the finer the mind. There can be very little
  doubt that the brain of a twentieth-century man compared with the brain of an
  ordinary man to-day, though in no way intrinsically inferior, was a far less
  polished and well-adjusted implement. It was warped by bad habits, cumbered
  with a tangle of unsound associations, clogged with unresolved complexes; it
  was like a fine piece of machinery in a state of dirt and neglect. The modern
  brain is far more neatly packed and better arranged, cleaner and better
  lubricated. It not only holds much more, but it uses the larger keyboard of
  our contemporary language more efficiently. The common man to-day is apt to
  find the philosophers and "thinkers" of two centuries ago unaccountably
  roundabout, tedious and encumbered. It is not so much that he finds them
  obscure, but that when at last he has dragged the meanings out of their
  jungles of statement into the light of day he finds he has thought all round
  them.</p>

  <p>An interesting and valuable group of investigators, whose work still goes
  on, appeared first in a rudimentary form in the nineteenth century. The
  leader of this group was a certain Lady Welby (1837-1912), who was frankly
  considered by most of her contemporaries as an unintelligible bore. She
  corresponded copiously with all who would attend to her, harping perpetually
  on the idea that language could be made more exactly expressive, that there
  should be a "Science of Significs". C. K. Ogden and a fellow Fellow of
  Magdalene College, I. A. Richards (1893-1977), were among the few who took
  her seriously. These two produced a book, The Meaning of Meaning, in 1923
  which counts as one of the earliest attempts to improve the language
  mechanism. Basic English was a by-product of these enquiries. The new Science
  was practically unendowed, it attracted few workers, and it was lost sight of
  during the decades of disaster. It was revived only in the early twenty-first
  century.</p>

  <p>Then Carl Ratan became the centre of a group of workers inspired by the
  idea of making English more lucid and comprehensive and a truly universal
  language. His work has expanded into the voluminous organization of the
  Language Bureau as we know it to-day. The work of that Bureau has been
  compared to the work of the monetary experts who finally made money exact a
  hundred and fifty years ago. Just as civilization was held back for some
  centuries by the imperfections of the money nexus, so we begin to realize
  to-day that our intellectual progress is by no means so rapid as it might be
  because of the endless flaws and looseness of the language nexus.</p>

  <p>An interesting compilation in hand, which promises to become a veritable
  history of philosophy and knowledge is the Language Discard. This project was
  originally set going by the Dictionary Section of the Language Bureau, as a
  mere account rendered of obsolete or obsolescent terms or terms which have
  become greatly altered from their original meaning; but the enquiry into the
  reasons for these changings and preferences and abandonments led very
  directly into an exhaustive analysis of the primary processes of human
  thought. A series of words, "soul spirit, matter, force, essence", for
  example, were built into the substance of Aryan and Semitic thought almost
  from their beginnings, and it was only quite recently that the exhaustive
  analyses by Yuan Shan and his associates of these framework terms made it
  clear that the processes of Chinese and Negro thinking were by no means
  parallel. Translation between languages, in all matters except matters of
  material statement, is always a little loose and rough, but between the
  ideology underlying the literature of Eastern Asia or the attempts of
  Africans to express themselves and that embodied in the ruling language of
  to-day the roughness approaches violence. That clash, as it is examined, is
  likely to produce very extensive innovations in our philosophical (general
  scientific) and technical nomenclature. We are speaking and writing a
  provisional language to-day. Our great-grandchildren will no more think of
  using many of our terms and turns of expression to-day than we should think
  of resorting again to the railway train, the paddle steamboat and the needle
  telegraph.</p>

  <p>This rearrangement of the association systems of the human brain which is
  now in progress brings with it&mdash;long before we begin to dream of eugenic
  developments&mdash;the prospect of at present inconceivable extensions of
  human mental capacity. It will involve taking hold of issues that are at
  present quite outside our grasp. There was a time when early man was no more
  capable of drawing a sketch or threading a needle than a cow; it was only as
  his thumb and fingers became opposable that the powers of craftsmanship and
  mechanism came within his grip. Similarly we may anticipate an enormous
  extension of research and a far deeper penetration into reality as language,
  our intellectual hand, is brought to a new level of efficiency.</p>

  <p>There is not only this sharpening and refinement of the brain going on,
  but there has been what our great grandparents would have considered an
  immense increase in the amount, the quality, and the accessibility of
  knowledge. As the individual brain quickens and becomes more skilful, there
  also appears a collective Brain, the Encyclopaedia, the Fundamental Knowledge
  System which accumulates, sorts, keeps in order and renders available
  everything that is known. The Encyclopaedic organization, which centres upon
  Barcelona, with its seventeen million active workers is the Memory of
  Mankind. Its tentacles spread out in one direction to millions of
  investigators, checkers and correspondents, and in another to keep the
  educational process in living touch with mental advance. It is growing
  rapidly as the continual advance in productive efficiency liberates fresh
  multitudes of workers for its services. The mental mechanism of mankind is as
  yet only in its infancy.</p>

  <p>Adolescence perhaps rather than infancy. It is because the mind of man is
  growing up that for the first time it realizes that it is young.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap5_08"
     name="chap5_08">8. &mdash; SUBLIMATION OF INTEREST</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Not only is the average man to-day an older and graver
  creature than his ancestor of three centuries ago, but he is very differently
  employed. There has been a great diversion of his interest from the primary
  necessities of life.</p>

  <p>Three centuries ago, well over ninety per cent of the human population was
  absorbed either in the direct production of necessities or in the scramble to
  get them from their original producers. Direct producers, the peasants and
  toilers, the entrepreneurs and their managers and directors, and direct
  distributors accounted for upward of eighty per cent of the human total; the
  rest were the millions of interveners, usurers, claim-makers, landowners,
  rentiers, solicitors, speculators, parasites, robbers, and thieves who were
  deemed necessary to ginger up the economic process. The forces of law, order
  and education, excluding temporary conscription and levies for military ends,
  took up five or six per cent of the residue, and a small minority, something
  under five per cent of the total population, supplied all the artistic
  effort, the scientific enquiry, the social and political thought, the living
  soul of the entire social body.</p>

  <p>The systems of interest of most people were therefore restricted almost
  entirely to work and the struggle to possess. They had to think continually
  of the work they did either for their own profit or for the personal profit,
  comfort or fantasy of some employer. They had to think of keeping their jobs
  or of getting fresh ones, and this, in the days of narrowing employment after
  the Hoover Slump, became at last a monstrous obsession of the brain. What
  they earned they had to spend carefully or guard carefully, for the rascaldom
  of business was everywhere seeking to give nothing for something. Sometimes,
  sick of their narrow lives, they would gamble in the desperate hope of a
  convulsive enlargement, and for most of them gambling meant disappointment
  and self-reproach. Add to these worries a little love, a good deal of hate,
  and a desperate struggle to see it all in a hopeful and honourable light, a
  desperate hunger to be flattered and reassured, and you have the content of
  ninety-nine per cent of the human brains that made the world of 1930. They
  could no more escape from this restricted circle of urgently clamorous
  interests, hardly ampler than the circle of an animal's interest, than the
  animals can.</p>

  <p>The Modern State has broken this cramping circle of interests for every
  human being. We are still creatures with brains like our forefathers,
  corresponding ganglia to ganglia and fibre to fibre, but WE ARE NOT USING
  THOSE BRAINS FOR THE SAME PURPOSES. The Modern State, by ensuring plenty and
  controlling the increase of population, has taken all the interests of the
  food-hunt and the food-scramble, and all the interests of the struggle to
  down-and-out our human competitors, away from the activities of the
  individual brain. A relatively small number of specialized workers keep the
  necessary Controls of these primary preoccupations going. We worry about
  food, drink, clothing, health and personal freedom no more. The work we MUST
  do is not burthensome in amount, and it is the most congenial our educational
  guardians can find for us and help us to find. When it is done we are sure of
  the result; nobody is left in the world to cheat us or rob us of our pay. We
  are still competitive, more so perhaps than ever; jealousy still wars with
  generosity in us; the story of our personal affections is rarely a simple
  story; but the interest we feel in our work is a masterful interest and not a
  driven interest, and our competition is for distinction, appreciation and
  self-approval and not for mutual injury. There has been a release of by far
  the larger moiety of the mental energy of the normal man from its former
  inescapable preoccupations.</p>

  <p>This steady obliteration of primary motives is manifested most
  illuminatingly by the statistics of what used to be "Crime and Punishment",
  figures of the offences, insubordinations and deliberate outrages upon social
  order and the consequent punishments and corrective proceedings that are
  issued by the disciplinary organization of the Behaviour Control. Statistics
  for the years of decadence are not forthcoming, but there is plentiful
  material from the comparatively orderly and prosperous period between 1890
  and 1930. Great Britain then constituted the healthiest and most law-abiding
  community in the world, but the figures that emerge to the student of history
  present what seems to us an appalling welter of crime. Stealing, cheating of
  every sort, forgery, burglary, robbery with violence, poisoning and other
  forms of murder, occurred daily. It did not seem as though that thick
  defilement of wrongdoing about property could ever cease. Innumerable
  suicides occurred through pecuniary worry. Yet now all these crimes, which
  filled the jails, arising out of the scramble for money and property in an
  age of insufficiency, have almost completely vanished from human life. The
  Behaviour Control Report for 2104 (2105 is not yet available) records 715
  cases of stealing for the whole world. In nearly every case the object stolen
  was some personal work of art, some small jewel, a piece of embroidery, a pet
  animal, several children, and&mdash;in one instance&mdash;the bulb of a new
  variety of lily that aroused the instinct to possess and care for. It is
  doubtful whether there were many undetected or unreported thefts.</p>

  <p>There has not, however, been anything like the same abolition of personal
  offences. They have diminished. But while the property offences have
  diminished to the scale of one-ten-millionth of the old-world figures, these
  others show a reduction in the nature of single instances to former hundreds.
  Many types in our population are still very easily turned toward sexual
  lawlessness. Beautiful and attractive people and particularly attractive
  children are not yet perfectly immune from undesired solicitation, personal
  persecution, annoying assault and resentful injury. Jealousy is still a
  dangerous passion, more particularly below the age of forty. The Behaviour
  Control ascribes nearly 520,000 offences to this group of urgencies, mostly
  assaults of varying degree of malignity, culminating in 67 murders. There
  were also 2192 suicides in the total. These figures show only a slight
  improvement upon the annual average for the previous decade.</p>

  <p>Another difficult class of offence which finds no exact parallel in the
  criminal statistics of former times, unless the British offence of "malignant
  mischief" is to be put in this group, are acts of annoyance, destruction,
  assault and so forth, due to competitive jealousy and the exasperation
  aroused, often quite unwittingly, by the bearing or achievements of one's
  fellow creatures. This sort of misbehaviour varies in degree from the black
  hatred and fury of an uncontrolled egotism to what verges in some cases upon
  justifiable criticism of slightly fatuous or self-complacent behaviour. Four
  murders, some hundreds of assaults and acts of wanton destruction in this
  category, witness to the fact that this world is still not a Paradise for
  every type of individual. Either they are bitter by some inner necessity or
  they have been embittered. Yet when we take the grand total of every misdeed
  that had to be dealt with last year, counting even the most petty occasions
  for restoration, warning or reproof, and find it is just three quarters of a
  million in a world of 2500 million people, we have a quantitative measure of
  human progress in two brief centuries that justifies a very stalwart
  confidence in the human outlook. The imagination of man's heart is no longer
  evil continually. It is only evil occasionally, and the practical task of our
  social psychologists is to reduce those occasions and provocations.</p>

  <p>The abundant release of brain-stuff, the mental plenty which has resulted
  from the organization of material plenty, is of necessity being directed into
  new channels. That meagre half per cent or less of creative workers of the
  old régime, the few curious men who played about with novel ideas, the odd
  men of leisure who collected "rarities" and inventions, has grown into a
  mighty body of enquiry, experiment, verification and record which is becoming
  now the larger part of the world's population.</p>

  <p>We know now certainly what the people of three centuries ago never
  suspected, that the human brain released from hunger, fear and the other
  primary stresses is very easily amenable not only to creative and directive
  desire but also to kindly and helpful impulses. Almost all the people who
  keep our productive, our distributing and transport services going are there
  because they find the work entertaining, because they like making the machine
  work well and helping people. There is a satisfaction in being able to do
  things skilfully for others that they could not do nearly so well for
  themselves. The barbers, shoemakers, tailors, dressmakers, hatters,
  outfitters and so forth in the great stores to-day are very different people
  from the rather obsequious, deferential "inferiors" who made our
  great-great-grandfathers presentable to the world. Their essential interest
  is to make their customers sightly and comfortable and not to earn a profit
  for an employer. The old literature reeks with contempt for barbers and
  tailors and cobblers, often the contempt of profound resentment. If the
  common man despised the cobbler, the cobbler pinched his toe and chafed his
  heel. The barber, it seemed, did no more than cut hair rather badly, and the
  tailor cut clothes. Except by accident, the barber had ceased to be a
  barber-surgeon. But nowadays the old-world barber would scarcely recognize
  himself in the barber-dentist, the kindly expert who sees to our coiffure,
  gives attention to our teeth, scrutinizes our mouth, hair and skin to detect
  any evidence of failing health, and sends us on our way refreshed, encouraged
  or warned. Often his friend the tailor or dressmaker will call in while he
  deals with us to consider our general bravery and improvement, and suggest
  variations of our exercise and habits.</p>

  <p>The old distributing trades have lost their sharp demarcation from the
  advisory professions. They are in touch with the guardians of development who
  have replaced the schoolmasters, nurses, governesses, tutors and so forth of
  the old time, and with the general advisers who have taken on the tasks of
  the family solicitor, religious minister, private confessor and general
  practitioner of the past. These advisory and directive professions probably
  number two or three times as big a proportion of the whole population as the
  lawyers, educationists and doctors of the nineteenth century. They merge
  again into another stratum, the specialist teachers, concerned with
  developing and imparting skills and building up and maintaining the common
  ideology. This class again passes by insensible degrees into the worlds of
  technical work, art, literature and scientific research.</p>

  <p>The primary producers and elaborators of material, our agriculturalists,
  engineers, chemists, transport men and industrial directors, also do their
  work because they like doing it. It satisfies them. They like their
  materials, they like their difficulties, they like the order of their days.
  In spite of an increasing output per head of population and an increasing
  variety and elaboration of the things we use, socially or individually, the
  numerical proportion of this section of the human population does not
  increase. Efficiency still outruns need and desire. The two and a half years
  of compulsory public service, which is an integral part of our education,
  supplies a larger and larger proportion of such toil as is still
  unavoidable.</p>

  <p>This release of human energy from primary needs is a process that seems
  likely to continue indefinitely. And all the forces that have made our world-
  wide social life and keep it going direct that released energy towards the
  achievement of fresh knowledge and the accumulation and rendering of fresh
  experience. There is a continual sublimation of interest. Man becomes more
  curious, more excited, more daring, skilful, and pleasantly occupied every
  year. The more we learn of the possibilities of our world and the
  possibilities of ourselves, the richer, we learn, is our inheritance. This
  planet, which seemed so stern a mother to mankind, is discovered to be
  inexhaustible in its bounty. And the greatest discovery man has made has been
  the discovery of himself. Leonardo da Vinci with his immense breadth of
  vision, his creative fervour, his curiosity, his power of intensive work, was
  the precursor of the ordinary man, as the world is now producing him.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap5_09"
     name="chap5_09">9. &mdash; A NEW PHASE IN THE HISTORY OF LIFE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">From the point of view of the ecologist the establishment of
  the Modern State marks an epoch in biological history. It has been an
  adaptation, none too soon, of our species to changing conditions that must
  otherwise have destroyed it. The immense developments and disasters of the
  nineteenth and twentieth centuries show us mankind scrambling on the verge of
  irreparable disaster.</p>

  <p>The infinite toil of millions of tormented brains, the devotion and
  persistence of countless forgotten devotees, gave form and clear purpose in
  time to what were at first mere flounderings and clutchings towards safety.
  The threatened race did not fall back into that abyss of extinction which has
  swallowed up so many of the bolder experiments of life. In pain and
  uncertainty it clambered past its supreme danger phase, and now it has
  struggled to such a level of assurance, understanding and safety as no living
  substance has ever attained before.</p>

  <p>By means of education and social discipline the normal human individual
  today acquires characteristics without which his continued existence would be
  impossible. In the future, as the obscurer processes of selection are
  accelerated and directed by eugenic effort, these acquired characteristics
  will be incorporated with his inherent nature, and his educational energy
  will be released for further adaptations. He will become generation by
  generation a new species, differing more widely from that weedy, tragic,
  pathetic, cruel, fantastic, absurd and sometimes sheerly horrible being who
  christened himself in a mood of oafish arrogance Homo sapiens.</p>

  <p>The differences of the coming man from the man of the past will be
  multitudinous and intricate, but certain broad lines of comparison appear
  already. We have noted already the difference in the age cycle between
  ourselves and our ancestors, which has prolonged the youthful phase and
  shifted on the valid years towards the thirty-five to eighty period, and we
  have cited also the completer physical development, due to the release of
  vital energy from the task of resisting various infections, poisons and
  morbidities of growth. We are probably only in the beginning of very much
  more considerable physical modification. The aesthetic ideals of the past are
  likely to play a large part in determining the direction in which these
  modifications will take us. But these physical developments, important though
  they must ultimately be, are as yet much less important than the changes in
  moral form that are manifestly in progress. A brief consideration of these
  will make a fitting conclusion to this general outline of history.</p>

  <p>Essentially they constitute a readjustment of the individual to the racial
  life. When we go back in time for a million years or so we find our ancestor
  species in a phase of almost fundamental individualism. Except where sexual
  life and the instinct system to protect offspring came in, the subman shifted
  for himself. He had no associates in the food hunt, no allies for defence. He
  was as solitary an animal as the tiger. From that he passed through stages of
  increasing sociability. The onset of these stages was made practicable by the
  retention of immature characteristics into adult life. The same thing is
  happening to the remnant of the lions today. They remain cubbish and friendly
  now to a much later age than they did a few-score thousand years ago. Man
  passed through a stage when he was as sociable as a modern lion and on to a
  phase when he was as sociable as a wolf or hunting dog.</p>

  <p>But he did not rest at that. All the conditions of his life favoured the
  formation of still-larger communities and still-closer interdependence. He
  became a cultivator, an economic animal, and his communities expanded to
  thousands and scores of thousands of individuals held together by mutual
  service. He produced language and religion to bind the will and activities of
  these aggregations into an effective common policy. The history of mankind,
  as we unfold it to the contemporary student, is a story of ever increasing
  communication and ever increasing interdependence. Insensibly the material
  side of individual freedom was modified into unavoidable cooperation with the
  community.</p>

  <p>Stress must be laid upon that word material. The physical subjugation and
  socialization of the human animal far outran his moral subjection. The
  history of mankind is also a history of education and compulsion. It is a
  record of give and take. Man almost up to the present day has remained at
  heart still the early savage, caring only for himself, for his sexual life,
  and, during the few years of their helplessness, his children. He has been
  willing to associate for aggression or for defence, but only very reluctantly
  for a common happiness. He has had to barter his freedom for the advantages
  of collective action, but he has done so against the grain, needing
  persuasion, pressure and helpful delusions.</p>

  <p>The history of mankind has had to be very largely the history of a
  succession of religious and emotional inventions and reconstructions, to
  override the inherent distaste in the individual for subordination and self-
  sacrifice. At every opportunity the individual has sought to recover its
  personal initiatives. Its egotism has battled instinctively of necessity to
  get the best of the bargain and receive with as little giving as
  possible.</p>

  <p>Man's natural self struggles to do that now as strongly as ever he did.
  But he struggles now in a better light and more intelligently; he realizes
  what is impossible, and the long conflict of individualism with society has
  arrived at a rational compromise. We have learnt how to catch and domesticate
  the ego at an early stage and train it for purposes greater than itself.</p>

  <p>What has happened during the past three and a half centuries to the human
  consciousness has been a sublimation of individuality. That phase is the
  quintessence of modern history. A large part of the commonplace life of man,
  the food-hunt, the shelter-hunt, the safety-hunt, has been lifted out of the
  individual sphere and socialized for ever. To that the human egotism has
  given its assent perforce. It has abandoned gambling and profit-seeking and
  all the wilder claims of property. It has ceased altogether to snatch,
  scramble and oust for material ends. And the common man has also been
  deprived of any weapons for his ready combativeness and of any liberty in its
  release. Nowadays even children do not fight each other. Gentleness in
  difference has become our second nature.</p>

  <p>All that part of man's life and interests has been socialized entirely
  against his natural disposition in the matter. In all those concerns the
  whole race is now confluent; it is becoming as much a colonial organism as
  any branching coral or polyp, though the ties that link us are not fleshly
  bands, but infinitely elastic and invisible and subtle. In the later chapters
  of this world history we have examined and displayed, with particular
  attention because of its culminating character, the essential individualism
  of the World War process, and we have told how, with what difficulty and
  after what scourgings, our race has been brought to its present phase of
  organized self-control. This present phase is the victory of creative power
  working through the individualities of a more intelligent minority, in the
  face of universal confusion, taking indeed advantage of that confusion to
  inaugurate our present order. That wilful minority has opened the gates to a
  power and abundance of existence beyond all former dreaming. But our Modern
  State has neither absorbed nor destroyed individuality, which now, accepting
  the necessary restrictions upon its material aggressiveness, resumes at every
  opportunity its freedom and enterprise upon a higher level of life.</p>

  <p>The individuality deprived, or relieved if you will, of its primary
  instinctive preoccupations with getting and keeping, disillusioned about
  precedence, personal display and suchlike barbaric vanities, growing
  continually and swiftly in wisdom and knowledge, has now to go further afield
  to find itself. No longer a self-sufficient being, at war with all its kind,
  it has become a responsible part of a species. It has become an experiment in
  feeling, knowing, making and response.</p>

  <p>The body of mankind is now one single organism of nearly two thousand five
  hundred million persons, and the individual differences of every one of these
  persons is like an exploring tentacle thrust out to test and learn, to savour
  life in its fullness and bring in new experiences for the common stock. We
  are all members of one body.* Only in the dimmest analogy has anything of
  this sort happened in the universe as we knew it before. Our sense of our
  individual difference makes our realization of our common being more acute.
  We work, we think, we explore, we dispute, we take risks and suffer&mdash;for
  there seems no end to the difficult and dangerous adventures individual men
  and women may attempt; and more and more plain does it become to us that it
  is not our little selves, but Man the Undying who achieves these things
  through us.</p>

  <p>* This was the phrase of that interesting mystic St. Paul (Saul) of Tarsus
  (2-62 C.E. Epistles with analysis and commentary by Hirsch and Potter in the
  Historical Reprints: Development of Ideas Series), who did so much to pervert
  and enlarge the simpler cosmopolitan fraternalism of Jesus of Nazareth (-4-30
  C.E.) before it was finally overwhelmed and lost in the sacrificial
  sacerdotalism of formal Christianity. For a brief period before it relapsed
  the Pauline cult had a curious flavour of Modern State feeling. There was,
  however, a politic disingenuousness in Paul which betrayed his undeniable
  intellectual power. He was ambiguous about blood sacrifices, immortality,
  private property and slavery, to the eternal injury of the Christian
  movement. It was completely prostituted to usage before the first century was
  over. See Ivan Mackenzie, General Elements of Religion 2103. Mackenzie has an
  excellent chapter on the anticipation of Modern State ideas by ancient
  writers, and is particularly interesting on the Superior Person (Generalized
  or Super Man) of Confucius (551-478 B.C.) and the City of God of St.
  Augustine (354-430).</p>

  <p>As the slower processes of heredity seize upon and confirm these social
  adaptations, as the confluence of wills supersedes individual motives and
  loses its present factors of artificiality, the history of life will pass
  into a new phase, a phase with a common consciousness and a common will. We
  in our time are still rising towards the crest of that transition. And when
  that crest is attained what grandeur of life may not open out to Man! Eye
  hath not seen, nor ear heard; nor hath it entered into the mind of man to
  conceive.... For now we see as in a glass darkly....</p>

  <p>At this point Raven's copied-out manuscript comes to an end&mdash;it seems
  to me a little abruptly. But it is the end; he has written the word "Finis"
  here. I will add only one word or so by way of comment. I have called that
  manuscript a dream book. Was it a dream book or was it indeed, as he declared
  and believed it to be, a vision of the shape of things to come?
  Or&mdash;there is a third possibility. As dreaming, this book is far too
  coherent; as vision, incredulity creeps in. But was Raven, too busily
  employed and too obsessed by the sense of urgency to embark upon a detailed
  analysis of world development, was he trying nevertheless to sketch out in
  this fantastic form a general thesis at least about the condition of things
  to come? If this is neither a dream book nor a Sibylline history, then it is
  a theory of world revolution. Plainly the thesis is that history must now
  continue to be a string of accidents with an increasingly disastrous trend
  until a comprehensive faith in the modernized World-State, socialistic,
  cosmopolitan and creative, takes hold of the human imagination. When the
  existing governments and ruling theories of life, the decaying religious and
  the decaying political forms of to-day, have sufficiently lost prestige
  through failure and catastrophe, then and then only will world-wide
  reconstruction be possible. And it must needs be the work, first of all, of
  an aggressive order of religiously devoted men and women who will try out and
  establish and impose a new pattern of living upon our race.</p>
