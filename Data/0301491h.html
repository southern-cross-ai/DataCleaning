     id="chap1">I. &mdash; WHITSUNTIDE AT FLAMBARD</a></h2>

  <p class="quote"><i>"Si la conscience qui sommeille dans l'instinct se
  réveillait, s'il s'intériorisait en connaissance au lieu de s'extérioriser en
  action, si nous savions l'interroger et s'il pouvait répondre, il nous
  livrerait les secrets de la vie."</i>&mdash;Bergson, <i>L'Evolution

  <p class="quote">"But no!" cried Mr Mantalini. "It is a demn'd horrid dream.
  It is not reality. No!"&mdash;<i>Nicholas Nickleby</i>.</p><br>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p>As I took my place at the dinner-table I realised that I was not the only
  tired mortal in Lady Flambard's Whitsuntide party. Mayot, who sat opposite
  me, had dark pouches under his eyes and that unwholesome high complexion
  which in a certain type of physique means that the arteries are working
  badly. I knew that he had been having a heavy time in the House of Commons
  over the Committee stage of his Factory Bill. Charles Ottery, who generally
  keeps himself fit with fives and tennis, and has still the figure of an
  athletic schoolboy, seemed nervous and out of sorts, and scarcely listened to
  his companion's chatter. Our hostess had her midseason look; her small
  delicate features were as sharp as a pin, and her blue eyes were drained of
  colour. But it was Arnold Tavanger farther down the table who held my
  attention. His heavy, sagacious face was a dead mask of exhaustion. He looked
  done to the world, and likely to fall asleep over his soup.</p>

  <p>It was a comfort to me to see others in the same case, for I was feeling
  pretty near the end of my tether. Ever since Easter I had been overworked out
  of all reason. There was a batch of important Dominion appeals before the
  Judicial Committee, in every one of which I was engaged, and I had some heavy
  cases in the Commercial Court. Of the two juniors who did most of my
  "devilling" one had a big patent-law action of his own, and the other was in
  a nursing-home with appendicitis. To make matters worse, I was chairman of a
  Royal Commission which was about to issue its findings, and had had to
  rewrite most of the report with my own hand, and I had been sitting as a
  one-man Commission in a troublesome dispute in the shipbuilding trade. Also I
  was expected to be pretty regularly in the House of Commons to deal with the
  legal side of Mayot's precious Bill, and the sittings had often stretched far
  into the next morning.</p>

  <p>There is something about a barrister's spells of overwork which makes them
  different in kind from those of other callings. His duties are specific as to
  time and place. He must be in court at a certain hour. He must be ready to
  put, or to reply to, an argument when he is called upon; he can postpone or
  rearrange his work only within the narrowest limits. He is a cog in an
  inexorable machine, and must revolve with the rest of it. For myself I
  usually enter upon a period of extreme busyness with a certain lift of
  spirit, for there is a sporting interest in not being able to see your way
  through your work. But presently this goes, and I get into a mood of nervous
  irritation. It is easy enough to be a carthorse, and it is easy enough to be
  a racehorse, but it is difficult to be a carthorse which is constantly being
  asked to take Grand National fences. One has to rise to hazards, but with
  each the take-off gets worse and the energy feebler. So at the close of such
  a spell I am in a wretched condition of soul and body&mdash;weary, but
  without power to rest, and with a mind so stale that it sees no light or
  colour in anything. Even the end of the drudgery brings no stimulus. I feel
  that my form has been getting steadily poorer, and that virtue has gone out
  of me which I may never recapture.</p>

  <p>I had been in two minds about accepting Sally Flambard's invitation. She
  is my very good friend, but her parties are rather like a table d'hôte. Her
  interests are multitudinous, and all are reflected in her hospitality, so
  that a procession goes through her house which looks like a rehearsal for the
  Judgement Day. Politics, religion, philanthropy, letters, science, art and
  the most brainless fashion&mdash;she takes them all to her capacious heart.
  She is an innocent lion-hunter, too, and any man or woman who figures for the
  moment in the Press will be a guest at Flambard. And she drives her team, for
  all are put through their paces. Sally makes her guests work for their
  entertainment. In her own way she is a kind of genius, and what Americans
  call a wonderful "mixer." Everyone has got to testify, and I have seen her
  make a bishop discourse on Church union, and a mathematician on hyper-space
  to an audience which heard of the topics for the first time. The talk is apt
  to be a little like a magazine page in a popular newspaper&mdash;very good
  fun, if you are feeling up to it, but not quite the thing for a
  rest-cure.</p>

  <p>It was my memory of Flambard itself that decided me. The place is set amid
  the greenest and quietest country on earth. The park is immense, and in early
  June is filled with a glory of flowers and blossoming trees. I could borrow
  one of Evelyn's horses and ride all day through the relics of ancient
  forests, or up on to the cool, windy spaces of the Downs. There was good
  dry-fly fishing in the little Arm, which runs through a shallow vale to the
  young Thames. At Whitsuntide you can recover an earlier England. The flood of
  greenery hides modern blemishes which are revealed by the bareness of winter,
  and an upland water-meadow is today just as it met the eye of the monks when
  they caught their Friday's trout, or of the corsleted knights as they rode
  out to the King's wars. It is the kind of scene that comforts me most, for
  there, as some poet says, "old Leisure sits knee-deep in grass." Also the
  house is large enough for peace. It is mostly Restoration period, with some
  doubtful Georgian additions, but there is a Tudor wing, the remnant of the
  old house, which the great Earl of Essex once used as a hunting lodge. Sally
  used to give me a room at the top of the Essex wing, with a wide prospect
  north into the Cotswold dales. The hall and the drawing-rooms and the great
  terrace might be as full of "turns" as a music-hall stage, but somewhere in
  the house fatigue could find sanctuary.</p>

  <p>I had arrived just in time to dress for dinner, and had spoken to none of
  my fellow-guests, so my inspection of the table had a speculative interest.
  It was a large party, and I saw a good many faces that I knew. There were the
  Nantleys, my best of friends, and their daughter Pamela, who was in her first
  season... There was old Folliot, the bore of creation, with his little grey
  imperial, and his smirk, and his tired eyes. He was retailing some ancient
  scandal to Mrs Lamington, who was listening with one ear and devoting the
  other to what Lady Altrincham was saying across the table. George Lamington a
  little farther down was arguing with his host about the Ascot
  entries&mdash;his puffy red face had that sudden shrewdness which it acquires
  when George's mind is on horses... There was a man opposite him of whom I
  could only catch the profile&mdash;a dark head with fine-drawn features. I
  heard his voice, a pleasant voice, with full deep tones like a tragic
  actor's, and, as he turned, I had an impression of a face full of swift,
  nervous strength... There was a good deal of youth in the party, four girls
  besides Pamela Brune, and several boys with sleek hair and fresh voices. One
  of them I knew, Reggie Daker, who was a friend of my nephew's.</p>

  <p>I was on Sally's left hand, and as she was busy with Mayot, and the lady
  on my left was deep in a controversy with her neighbour over some book, I was
  free to look about me. Suddenly I got a queer impression. A dividing line
  seemed to zigzag in and out among us, separating the vital from the
  devitalised. There was a steady cackle of talk, but I felt that there were
  silent spaces in it. Most of the people were cheerful, eupeptic souls who
  were enjoying life. The Nantleys, for example, sedate country gentlefolk,
  whose days were an ordered routine of pleasant cares... Pamela Brune? I was
  not so sure of her, for a young girl's first season is a trying business,
  like a boy's first half at school... Old Folliot, beyond doubt&mdash;he was
  perfectly happy as long as he was in a great house with somebody to listen to
  his archaic gossip... Evelyn Flambard and George Lamington and the boys who
  were talking Ascot and next winter's hunting plans... Lady Altrincham, sixty
  but with the air of thirty, who lives for her complexion and her famous
  pearls... But I realised that there were people here who were as much at odds
  with life as myself&mdash;Mayot and Tavanger and Charles Ottery, and perhaps
  the dark fellow who sat opposite George Lamington.</p>

  <p>Sally turned to me, hiding a yawn with her small hand. Her head on its
  slim neck was as erect as a bird's, and her body had a darting, bird-like
  poise, but I could see that the poise required some effort to maintain it.
  She patted my sleeve in her friendly way.</p>

  <p>"I am so glad you came," she said. "I know you want a rest." She screwed
  up her eyes and peered at me. "You look as if you hadn't been in bed for a
  month!"</p>

  <p>"I'm nearly all out," I said. "You must let me moon about by myself,
  please, for I'm no sort of company for anybody."</p>

  <p>"You shall do exactly as you like. I'm pretty tired also, and I'm giving a
  ball next week, and there's Ascot looming ahead. Happily we're having quite a
  small party&mdash;and a very quiet one."</p>

  <p>"Is this the lot?" I asked, looking down the table. I knew her habit of
  letting guests appear in relays during a weekend till the result was a
  mob.</p>

  <p>"Practically. You know all the people?"</p>

  <p>"Most of them. Who's the dark fellow opposite George Lamington?"</p>

  <p>Her face brightened into interest. "That's my new discovery. A country
  neighbour, no less&mdash;but a new breed altogether. His name is
  Goodeve&mdash;Sir Robert Goodeve. He has just succeeded to the place and
  title."</p>

  <p>Of course I knew Goodeve, that wonderful moated house in the lap of the
  Downs, but I had never met one of the race. I had had a notion that it had
  died out. The Goodeves are one of those families about which genealogists
  write monographs, a specimen of that unennobled gentry which is the oldest
  stock in England. They had been going on in their undistinguished way since
  Edward the Confessor.</p>

  <p>"Tell me about him," I said.</p>

  <p>"I can't tell you much. You can see what he looks like. Did you ever know
  a face so lit up from behind?... He was the son of a parson in
  Northumberland, poor as a church mouse, so he had to educate himself. Local
  grammar school, some provincial university, and then with scholarships and
  tutoring he fought his way to Oxford. There he was rather a swell, and made
  friends with young Marburg, old Isaac's son, who got him a place in his
  father's business. The War broke out, and he served for four years, while
  Marburgs kept his job open. After that they moved him a good deal about the
  world, and he was several years in their New York house. It is really a
  romance, for at thirty-five he had made money, and now at thirty-eight he has
  inherited Goodeve and a good deal more... Yes, he's a bachelor. Not rich as
  the big fortunes go, but rich enough. The thing about him is that he has got
  his jumping-off ground reasonably young, and is now about to leap. Quite
  modest, but perfectly confident, and terribly ambitious. He is taking up
  politics, and I back him to make you all sit up. I think he's the most
  impressive mortal I have ever met. Bored stiff with women&mdash;as
  stony-hearted as you, Ned. He's a sort of ascetic, vowed to a cause."</p>

  <p>"His own career?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"No. No. He's not a bit of an egotist. There's a pent-up force that's got
  to come out. He's a fanatic about some new kind of Empire development, and I
  know people who think him a second Rhodes. I want you to make friends with
  him and tell me what you think, for in your fish-like way you have good
  judgement."</p>

  <p>Sally yawned again, and I respected more than ever the courage of women
  who can go on till they drop and keep smiling. She turned away in response to
  a question of Mayot's, and I exchanged banalities with the lady on my other
  side. Presently I found myself free again to look round the table. I was
  right: we were the oddest mixture of the fresh and the blasé, the care-free
  and the care-worn. To look at Tavanger's hollow eyes and hear in one's ear
  the babble of high young voices made a contrast which was almost indecent...
  I had a feeling as if we were all on a vast, comfortable raft in some unknown
  sea, and that, while some were dancing to jazz music, others were crowding
  silently at the edge, staring into the brume ahead. Staring anxiously, too,
  for in that mist there might be fearful as well as wonderful things... I
  found myself studying George Lamington's face, and felt a childish dislike of
  him. His life was so padded and cosseted and bovine. He had just inherited
  another quarter of a million from an uncle, and he had not the imagination of
  a rabbit in the use of money. Why does wealth make dull people so much
  duller? I had always rather liked George, but now I felt him intolerable. I
  must have been very tired, for I was getting as full of silly prejudices as a
  minor poet.</p>

  <p>Sally was speaking again, as she collected eyes.</p>

  <p>"Don't be afraid. This is going to be a very peaceful party."</p>

  <p>"Will you promise me," I said, "that I won't come down tomorrow and find
  half a dozen new faces at breakfast?"</p>

  <p>"Honest Injun," she replied. "They are all here except one, and he arrives
  tonight."</p>

  <p>When the women had gone Evelyn Flambard brought his port to my side.
  Having exhausted horses during dinner, he regaled me with the Englishman's
  other main topic, politics. Evelyn despaired of the republic. He had
  grievances against the Budget, the new rating law, and the Government's
  agricultural policy. He was alarmed about the condition of India, where he
  had served in his old Hussar days, and about Egypt, where he had large
  investments. His views on America were calculated to make a serious breach
  between the two sections of the Anglo-Saxon race. But if he feared the
  Government he despised the Opposition, though for politeness' sake he added
  that his strictures did not apply to me. There was no honest Toryism left, so
  his plaint ran; there was not a pin to choose between the parties; they were
  all out to rob struggling virtue&mdash;meaning himself and other comfortable
  squires. He nodded down the table towards Goodeve. "Look at that chap," he
  whispered darkly. "I mean to say, he don't care a straw what he says or does,
  and he'll have Tommy Twiston's seat, which is reckoned the safest in England.
  He as good as told George Lamington this afternoon that he'd like to see a
  Soviet Government in power for a week in England under strict control, for it
  was the only way to deal with men like him. Hang it all, there's nothing
  wrong with old George except that he's a bit fussy, if you see what I
  mean."</p>

  <p>I said that I rather agreed with Goodeve, and that set Evelyn pouring out
  his woes to the man on the other side. Reggie Daker had come up next me, his
  eye heavy with confidences. I had acted as a sort of father-confessor to
  Reggie ever since he came down from the University, but I hadn't much credit
  by my disciple. He was infinitely friendly, modest, and good-humoured, but as
  hard to hold as a knotless thread. Usually he talked to me about his career,
  and I had grown very tired of finding him jobs, which he either shied off or
  couldn't hold for a week. Now it seemed that this was not his trouble. He had
  found his niche at last, and it was dealing in rare books. Reggie considered
  that a lad like himself, with a fine taste and a large acquaintance, could
  make a lot of money by digging out rarities from obscure manor-houses and
  selling them to American collectors. He had taken up the study very
  seriously, he told me, and he actually managed to get a few phrases of
  bibliophile's jargon into his simple tale. He felt that he had found his
  life's work, and was quite happy about it.</p>

  <p>The trouble was Pamela Brune. It appeared that he was deeply in love, and
  that she was toying with his young heart. "There's a strong lot of entries,"
  he explained, "and Charles Ottery has been the favourite up till now. But she
  seems a bit off Charles, and... and... anyhow, I'm going to try my luck. I
  wangled an invitation here for that very purpose. I say, you know&mdash;
  you're her godfather, aren't you? If you could put in a kind word... "</p>

  <p>But my unreceptive eye must have warned Reggie that I was stony soil. He
  had another glass of port, and sighed.</p>

  <p>I intended to go to bed as soon as I decently could. I was not sleepy, but
  I was seeing things with the confusion of a drowsy man. As I followed my host
  across the hall, where someone had started a gramophone, I seemed more than
  ever to be in a phantasmal world. The drawing-room, with the delicate fluted
  pilasters in its panelling and the Sir Joshuas and Romneys between them, swam
  in a green dusk, which was partly the afterglow through the uncurtained
  windows and partly the shading of the electric lamps. A four at bridge had
  been made up, and the young people were drifting back towards the music. Lady
  Nantley beckoned me from a sofa. I could see her eyes appraising my face and
  disapproving of it, but she was too tactful to tell me that I looked ill.</p>

  <p>"I heard that you were to be here, Ned," she said, "and I was very glad.
  Your god-daughter is rather a handful just now, and I wanted your
  advice."</p>

  <p>"What's wrong?" I asked. "She's looking uncommonly pretty." I caught a
  glimpse of Pamela patting her hair as she passed a mirror, slim and swift as
  a dryad.</p>

  <p>"She's uncommonly perverse. You know that she has been having an affair
  with Charles Ottery ever since Christmas at Wirlesdon. I love Charles, and
  Tom and I were delighted. Everything most suitable&mdash;the right age,
  enough money, chance of a career, the same friends. There's no doubt that
  Charles adores her, and till the other day I thought that she was coming to
  adore Charles. But now she has suddenly gone off at a tangent, and has taken
  to snubbing and neglecting him. She says that he's too good for her, and that
  his perfections choke her&mdash;doesn't want to play second fiddle to an
  Admirable Crichton&mdash;wants to shape her own life&mdash;all the rubbish
  that young people talk nowadays."</p>

  <p>Mollie's charming eyes were full of real distress, and she put an
  appealing hand on my arm.</p>

  <p>"She likes you, Ned, and believes in you. Couldn't you put a little sense
  into her head?"</p>

  <p>I wanted to say that I was feeling like a ghost from another sphere, and
  that it was no good asking a tenuous spectre to meddle with the affairs of
  warm flesh and blood. But I was spared the trouble of answering by the
  appearance of Lady Flambard.</p>

  <p>"Forgive me, Mollie dear," she said, "but I must carry him off. I'll bring
  him back to you presently."</p>

  <p>She led me to a young man who was standing near the door. "Bob," she said,
  "this is Sir Edward Leithen. I've been longing for you two to meet."</p>

  <p>"So have I," said the other, and we shook hands. Now that I saw Goodeve
  fairly, I was even more impressed than by his profile as seen at dinner. He
  was a finely made man, and looked younger than his thirty-eight years. He was
  very dark, but not in the least swarthy; there were lights in his hair which
  suggested that he might have been a blond child, and his skin was a clear
  brown, as if the blood ran strongly and cleanly under it. What I liked about
  him was his smile, which was at once engaging and natural, and a little shy.
  It took away any arrogance that might have lurked in the tight mouth and
  straight brows.</p>

  <p>"I came here to meet you, sir," he said. "I'm a candidate for public life,
  and I wanted to see a man who interests me more than anybody else in the
  game. I hope you don't mind my saying that... What about going into the
  garden? There's a moon of sorts, and the nightingales will soon begin. If
  they're like the ones at Goodeve, eleven's their hour."</p>

  <p>We went through the hall to the terrace, which lay empty and quiet in a
  great dazzle of moonlight. It was only about a fortnight till midsummer, a
  season when in fine weather in southern England it is never quite dark. Now,
  with a moon nearing the full, the place was bright enough to read print. The
  stone balustrade and urns were white as snow, and the two stairways that led
  to the sunk garden were a frosty green like tiny glaciers.</p>

  <p>We threaded the maze of plots and lily-ponds and came out on a farther
  lawn, which ran down to the little river. That bit of the Arm is no good for
  fishing, for it has been trimmed into a shallow babbling stretch of
  ornamental water, but it is a delicious thing in the landscape. There was no
  sound except the lapse of the stream, and the occasional squattering flight
  of a moorhen. But as we reached the brink a nightingale began in the next
  thicket.</p>

  <p>Goodeve had scarcely spoken a word. He was sniffing the night scents,
  which were a wonderful blend of early roses, new-mown hay, and dewy turf.
  When we reached the Arm, we turned and looked back at the house. It seemed
  suddenly to have gone small, set in a great alley-way of green between olive
  woods, an alley-way which swept from the high downs to the river meadows. Far
  beyond it we could see the bare top of Stobarrow. But it looked as perfect as
  a piece of carved ivory&mdash;and ancient, ancient as a boulder left
  millenniums ago by a melting ice-cap.</p>

  <p>"Pretty good," said my companion at last. "At Flambard you can walk
  steadily back into the past. Every chapter is written plain to be read."</p>

  <p>"At Goodeve, too," I said.</p>

  <p>"At Goodeve, too. You know the place? It is the first home I have had
  since I was a child, for I have been knocking about for years in lodgings and
  tents. I'm still a little afraid of it. It's a place that wants to master
  you. I'm sometimes tempted to give myself up to it and spend my days
  listening to its stories and feeling my way back through the corridors of
  time. But I know that that would be ruin."</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"Because you cannot walk backward. It is too easy, and the road leads
  nowhere. A man must keep his eyes to the front and resist the pull of his
  ancestors. They're the devil, those ancestors, always trying to get you back
  into their own rut."</p>

  <p>"I wish mine would pull harder," I said. "I've been badly overworked
  lately, and I feel at this moment like a waif, with nothing behind me and
  nothing before."</p>

  <p>He regarded me curiously. "I thought you looked a little done up. Well,
  that's the penalty of being a swell. You'll lie fallow for a day or two and
  the power will return. There can't be much looking backward in your
  life."</p>

  <p>"Nor looking forward. I seem to live between high blank walls. I never get
  a prospect."</p>

  <p>"Oh, but you are wrong," he said seriously. "All your time is spent in
  trying to guess what is going to happen&mdash;what view the Courts will take
  of a case, what kind of argument will hit the prospective mood of the House.
  It is the same in law and politics and business and everything practical.
  Success depends on seeing just a little more into the future than other
  people."</p>

  <p>I remembered my odd feeling at dinner of the raft on the misty sea, and
  the anxious peering faces at the edge.</p>

  <p>"Maybe," I said. "But just at the moment I'm inclined to envy the people
  who live happily in the present. Our host, for example, and the boys and
  girls who are now dancing." In the stillness the faint echo of music drifted
  to us from the house.</p>

  <p>"I don't envy them a bit," he said. "They have no real sporting interest.
  Trying to see something solid in the mist is the whole fun of life, and most
  of its poetry."</p>

  <p>"Anyhow, thank Heaven, we can't see very far. It would be awful to look
  down an avenue of time as clear as this strip of lawn, and see the future as
  unmistakable as Flambard."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps. But sometimes I would give a good deal for one moment of
  prevision."</p>

  <p>After that, as we strolled back, we talked about commonplace
  things&mdash;the prospects of a not very secure Government, common friends,
  the ways of our hostess, whom he loved, and the abilities of Mayot,
  which&mdash;along with me&mdash;he doubted. As we entered the house again we
  found the far end of the hall brightly lit, since the lamps had been turned
  on in the porch. The butler was ushering in a guest who had just arrived, and
  Sally had hastened from the drawing-room to greet him.</p>

  <p>The newcomer was one of the biggest men I have ever seen, and one of the
  leanest. A suit of grey flannel hung loose upon his gigantic bones. He
  reminded me of Nansen, except that he was dark instead of fair. His forehead
  rose to a peak, on which sat one solitary lock, for the rest of his head was
  bald. His eyes were large and almost colourless, mere pits of light beneath
  shaggy brows. He was bowing over Sally's hand in a foreign way, and the
  movement made him cough.</p>

  <p>"May I present Sir Edward Leithen?" said Sally. "Sir Robert Goodeve...
  Professor Moe."</p>

  <p>The big man gave me a big hand, which felt hot and damp. His eyes regarded
  me with a hungry interest. I had an impression of power&mdash;immense power,
  and also an immense fragility.</p><br>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p>I did not have a good night; I rarely do when I have been overworking. I
  started a chapter of Barchester Towers, dropped off in the middle, and woke
  in two hours, restless and unrefreshed. Then I must have lain awake till the
  little chill before dawn which generally sends me to sleep. The window was
  wide open, and all the minute sounds of a summer night floated through it,
  but they did not soothe me. I had one of those fits of dissatisfaction which
  often assail the sleepless. I felt that I was making very little of my life.
  I earned a large income, and had a considerable position in the public eye,
  but I was living, so to speak, from hand to mouth. I had long lost any
  ordinary ambitions, and had ceased to plan out my career ahead, as I used to
  do when I was a young man. There were many things in public life on which I
  was keen, but it was only an intellectual keenness; I had no ardour in their
  pursuit. I felt as if my existence were utterly shapeless.</p>

  <p>It was borne in on me that Goodeve was right. What were his
  words?&mdash;"Trying to see something solid in the mist is the whole fun of
  life, and most of its poetry." Success, he had argued, depended upon looking
  a little farther into the future than other people. No doubt; but then I
  didn't want success&mdash;not in the ordinary way. He had still his spurs to
  win, whereas I had won mine, and I didn't like the fit of them. Yet all the
  same I wanted some plan and policy in my life, for I couldn't go on living in
  the mud of the present. My mind needed prospect and horizon. I had often made
  this reflection before in moments of disillusionment, but now it came upon me
  with the force of a revelation. I told myself that I was beginning to be
  cured of my weariness, for I was growing discontented, and discontent is a
  proof of vitality... As I fell asleep I was thinking of Goodeve and realising
  how much I liked him. His company might prove the tonic I required.</p>

  <p>I rose early and went for a walk along the Arm to look for a possible
  trout. The May-fly season was over, but there were one or two good fish
  rising beyond a clump of reeds where the stream entered the wood. Then I
  breakfasted alone with Evelyn, for Flambard is not an early house. His horses
  were mostly at grass, but he lent me a cob of Sally's. I changed into
  breeches, cut a few sandwiches, and set out for the high Downs. I fancied
  that a long lonely day on the hills would do me as much good as anything.</p>

  <p>It was a quiet dim morning which promised a day of heat. I rode through a
  mile of woods full of nesting pheasants, then over a broomy common, and then
  by way of a steep lane on to the turf of the Downs. I found myself on the
  track where Evelyn exercised his race-horses, for he trained at home, so I
  gave my beast its head, and had that most delectable of experiences, a gallop
  over perfect turf. This brought me well up on the side of Stobarrow, and by
  the time I reached its summit the haze was clearing, and I was looking over
  the Arm and the young Thames to the blue lift of Cotswold.</p>

  <p>I spent the whole day on the uplands. I ate my sandwiches in a clump of
  thorns, and had a mug of rough cider at an alehouse. I rode down long
  waterless combes, and ascended other tops besides Stobarrow. For an hour I
  lay on a patch of thyme, drowsy with the heat and the aromatic scents. I
  smoked a pipe with an old shepherd, and heard slow tales of sheep and dogs
  and storms and forgotten fox-hunts. In the end I drugged myself into a sort
  of animal peace. Thank God, I could still get back when I pleased to the
  ancient world of pastoral.</p>

  <p>But when on my return I came over the brink of Stobarrow I realised that I
  had gained little. The pastoral world was not mine; my world was down below
  in the valley where men and women were fretting and puzzling... I no longer
  thought of them as on a raft looking at misty seas, but rather as spectators
  on a ridge, trying to guess what lay beyond the next hill. Tavanger and Mayot
  and Goodeve&mdash;they were all at it. A futile game, maybe, but inevitable,
  since what lay beyond the hill was life and death to them. I must recapture
  the mood for this guessing game, for it was the mainspring of effort, and
  therefore of happiness.</p>

  <p>I got back about six, had a bath, and changed into flannels. Sally gave me
  a cup of tea at a table in the hall which carried food for a multitude, but
  did not look as if it had been much patronised. Evelyn and the Lamingtons had
  gone to see the Wallingdon training stables; the young people had had tea in
  the tennis-court pavilion; Mayot had motored to Cirencester to meet a friend,
  and Tavanger had gone to Goodeve to look at the pictures, in which subject he
  was a noted connoisseur; Charles Ottery had disappeared after luncheon, and
  she had sent the Professor to bed till dinner.</p>

  <p>Sally's face wore something between a smile and a frown.</p>

  <p>"Reggie Daker is in bed, too. He was determined to try Sir Vidas over the
  jumps in the park, though Evelyn warned him that the horse was short of
  exercise and was sure to give trouble. The jumps haven't been mended for
  months, and the take-off at some of them is shocking. Well, Sir Vidas came
  down all right, and Reggie fell on his head and nearly cracked his skull. He
  was concussed, and unconscious for a quarter of an hour. Dr Micklem sewed him
  up, and he is now in bed, covered with bandages, and not allowed to speak or
  be spoken to till tomorrow. It's hard luck on poor Reggie, but it will keep
  him for a little from making a fool of himself about Pamela Brune. He hasn't
  a chance there, you know, and he is such a tactless old donkey that he is
  spoiling the field for Charles Ottery."</p>

  <p>But it was not Reggie's misfortunes that made my hostess frown. Presently
  I learned the reason.</p>

  <p>"I'm very glad of the chance of a quiet talk with you," she said. "I want
  to speak to you about Professor Moe. You saw him when he arrived last night.
  What did you think of him?"</p>

  <p>"He seemed a formidable personage," I replied. "He looked very ill."</p>

  <p>"He IS very ill. I had no notion how ill he was. He makes light of it, but
  there must be something mortally wrong with his lungs or his heart. He seems
  to be always in a fever, and now and then he simply gasps for breath. He says
  he has been like that for years, but I can't believe it. It's a tragedy, for
  he is one of the greatest minds in the world."</p>

  <p>"I never heard of him before."</p>

  <p>"You wouldn't. You're not a scientist. He's a most wonderful mathematician
  and physicist&mdash;rather in the Einstein way. He has upset every scientific
  law, but you can't understand just how unless you're a great scientist
  yourself. Our own people hush their voices when they mention him."</p>

  <p>"How did you come across him?"</p>

  <p>"I met him last year in Berlin. You know I've a flair for clever people,
  and they seem to like me, though I don't follow a word they say. I saw that
  he was to be in London to read a paper to some society, so I thought I'd ask
  him to Flambard to show him what English country life was like. Rather to my
  surprise he accepted&mdash;I think London tired him and he wanted a
  rest."</p>

  <p>"You're worried about him? Are you afraid that he'll die on your
  hands?"</p>

  <p>"No-o," she answered. "He's very ill, but I don't think he'll die just
  yet. What worries me is to know how to help him. You see, he took me into his
  confidence this morning. He accepted my invitation because he wanted the
  quiet of the country to finish a piece of work. A tremendous piece of
  work&mdash;the work of his life... He wants something more. He wants our
  help. It seems that some experiment is necessary before he can be quite sure
  of his ground."</p>

  <p>"What sort of experiment?"</p>

  <p>"With human beings&mdash;the right kind of human beings. You mustn't laugh
  at me, Ned, for I can't explain what he told me, though I thought I
  understood when he was speaking... It has something to do with a new theory
  of Time. He thinks that Time is not a straight line, but full of coils and
  kinks. He says that the Future is here with us now, if we only knew how to
  look for it. And he believes he has found a way of enabling one to know what
  is going to happen a long time ahead."</p>

  <p>I laughed. "Useful for Evelyn and George. They'll be able to back all the
  Ascot winners."</p>

  <p>But Sally did not laugh.</p>

  <p>"You must be serious. The Professor is a genius, and I believe every word
  he says. He wants help, he told me. Not people like Evelyn and George. He has
  very clear ideas about the kind of man he needs. He wants Mr Mayot and Mr
  Tavanger and perhaps Charles Ottery, though he's not quite sure about
  Charles. Above all, he wants you and Bob Goodeve. He saw you last night, and
  took a tremendous fancy to you both."</p>

  <p>I forbore to laugh only out of deference to Sally's gravity. It seemed a
  reduction to the absurd of Goodeve's talk the night before and my reflections
  on the Downs. I had decided that I must be more forward-looking, and here was
  a wild foreigner who believed that he had found the exact technique of the
  business.</p>

  <p>"I don't like it," I said. "The man is probably mad."</p>

  <p>"Oh, no, he isn't. He is brilliantly sane. You have only to talk to him to
  realise that. Even when I couldn't follow him I could see that he was not
  talking nonsense. But the point is that he wants to put it all before you. He
  is certain that he can make a convert of you."</p>

  <p>"But I don't know the first thing about science. I have often got up a
  technical subject for a case, and then washed it out of my mind. I've never
  been instructed in the first principles. I don't understand the
  language."</p>

  <p>"That is just why Professor Moe wants you. He says he wants a fresh mind,
  and a mind trained like yours to weigh evidence. It wasn't your beaux yeux,
  Ned, that he fell for, but your reputation as a lawyer."</p>

  <p>"I don't mind listening to what he has got to say. But look here, Sally, I
  don't like this experiment business. What does he propose?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing in the least unpleasant. It only means one or two people
  preparing themselves for an experience, which he says he can give them, by
  getting into a particular frame of mind. He's not sure if he can bring it
  off, you know. The experiment is to be the final proof of his discovery. He
  was emphatic that there was no danger and no unpleasantness, whether it was
  successful or not... But he was very particular about the people he wanted.
  He was looking at us all this morning with the queerest appraising eyes. He
  wants you and Bob especially, and Mr Mayot and Mr Tavanger, and possibly
  Charles. Oh, yes, and he thinks he may want me. But nobody else. He was
  perfectly clear about that."</p>

  <p>I must say that this rather impressed me. He had chosen exactly those whom
  I had selected at dinner the previous night as the care-full as opposed to
  the care-free. He wanted people whose physical vitality was low, and who were
  living on the edge of their nerves, and he had picked them unerringly out of
  Sally's house-party.</p>

  <p>"All right," I said. "I'll have a talk to him after dinner. But I want you
  to be guided by me, and if I think the thing fishy to call it off. If the man
  is as clever as you say, he may scare somebody into imbecility."</p>

  <p>Before I dressed I rang up Landor, and was lucky enough to find him still
  in London. Landor, besides being a patent-law barrister pretty near the top
  of his branch, is a Fellow of the Royal Society, and a devotee of those dim
  regions where physics, metaphysics, and mathematics jostle each other. He has
  published and presented me with several works which I found totally
  incomprehensible.</p>

  <p>When I asked him about Professor Moe he replied with a respectful gurgle.
  "You don't mean to say you've got him at Flambard? What astounding luck! I
  thought he had gone back to Stockholm. There are scores of people who would
  walk twenty miles barefoot to get a word with him."</p>

  <p>Landor confirmed all that Sally had said about the Professor's standing.
  He had been given the Nobel Prize years ago, and was undoubtedly the greatest
  mathematician alive. But recently he had soared into a world where it was not
  easy to keep abreast of him. Landor confessed that he had only got
  glimmerings of meaning from the paper he had read two days before to the
  Newton Club. "I can see the road he is travelling," he said, "but I can't
  quite grasp the stages." And he quoted Wordsworth's line about "Voyaging
  through strange seas of thought alone."</p>

  <p>"He's the real thing," I asked, "and not a charlatan?"</p>

  <p>I could hear Landor's cackle at the other end of the line.</p>

  <p>"You might as well ask a conscript to vouch for Napoleon's abilities as
  ask me to give a certificate of respectability to August Moe."</p>

  <p>"You're sure he's quite sane?</p>

  <p>"Absolutely. He's only mad in so far as all genius is mad. He is reputed
  to be a very good fellow and very simple. Did you know that he once wrote a
  book on Hans Andersen? But he looked to me a pretty sick man. There's a lot
  of hereditary phthisis in his race."</p>

  <p>Dinner that evening was a pleasanter meal for me. I had more of an
  appetite, there was a less leaden air about my companions in fatigue, the
  sunburnt boys and girls were in good form, and Reggie Daker's woebegone
  countenance was safe on its pillow. Charles Ottery, who sat next to Pamela
  Brune, seemed to be in a better humour, and Mrs Lamington was really amusing
  about the Wallingdon stables and old Wallingdon's stable-talk. I had been
  moved farther down the table, and had a good view of Professor Moe, who sat
  next to our hostess. His was an extraordinary face&mdash;the hollow cheeks
  and the high cheekbones, the pale eyes, the broad high brow, and the bald
  head rising to a peak like Sir Walter Scott's. The expression was very
  gentle, like a musing child, but now and then he seemed to kindle, and an odd
  gleam appeared in his colourless pits of eyes. For all his size he looked
  terribly flimsy. Something had fretted his body to a decay.</p>

  <p>He came up to me as soon as we left the dining-room. He spoke excellent
  English, but his voice made me uneasy&mdash;it seemed to come with difficulty
  from a long way down in his big frame. There was a vague, sad kindliness
  about his manner, but there was a sense of purpose too. He went straight to
  the point.</p>

  <p>"Some time you are going to give me your attention, Sir Edward, and I in
  return will give you my confidence. Her ladyship has so informed me. She
  insists, that gracious one, that I must go to bed, for I am still weary.
  Shall our talk be tomorrow after breakfast? In the garden, please, if the sun
  still shines."</p><br>

  <h3>III</h3>

  <p>I find it almost impossible to give the gist of the conversation which
  filled the next forenoon. We sat in wicker chairs on the flags of the Dutch
  garden in a grilling sun, for heat seemed to be the one physical comfort for
  which the Professor craved. I shall always associate the glare of a June sky
  with a frantic effort on my part to grasp the ultimate imponderables of human
  thought.</p>

  <p>The Professor was merciful to my weakness. He had a great writing-pad on
  his knee, and would fain have illustrated his argument with diagrams, but he
  desisted when he found that they meant little to me and really impeded his
  exposition. Most scientists use a kind of shorthand&mdash;formulas and
  equations which have as exact a meaning for them as an ordinary noun has for
  the ordinary man. But there was no chance for this shorthand with me. He had
  to begin from the very beginning, taking nothing for granted. I realised his
  difficulty. It was as if I had had to argue an intricate case, not before a
  learned judge, but before an intelligent ignoramus, to whom each technical
  legal term had to be laboriously explained.</p>

  <p>There was another difficulty, which applied not to me only, but to the
  most intelligent auditor in the world. Suppose you are trying to expound to a
  man who has been stone-deaf from birth the meaning of sound. You can show him
  the physical effects of it, the brain and sense reactions, but the FACT of
  sound you cannot bring home to him by any diagram or calculation. It is
  something for him without sensory vividness, altogether outside his realised
  universe. It was the same with the Professor's exposition of strange new
  dimensions, the discovery of which depended on logical processes. I could not
  grasp them imaginatively, and, not having lived as he had done with the
  arguments, I could not comprehend them intellectually.</p>

  <p>But here&mdash;very crudely and roughly&mdash;is the kind of thing he
  tried to tell me.</p>

  <p>He began by observing that in the blind instinct of man there was
  something which the normal intellect lacked&mdash;a prevision of future
  happenings, for which reason gave no warrant. We all of us had occasionally
  dim anticipations of coming events, lurking somewhere in our nerves. A man
  walking in the dark was aware subconsciously of a peril and subconsciously
  braced himself to meet it. He quoted the sentences from Bergson which I have
  put at the head of the chapter. His aim was to rationalise and systematise
  this anticipatory instinct.</p>

  <p>Then he presented me with a theory of Time, for he had an orderly mind,
  and desired to put first things first. Here he pretty well bogged me at the
  start. He did not call Time a fourth dimension, but I gathered that it
  amounted to that, or rather that it involved many new dimensions. There
  seemed to be a number of worlds of presentation travelling in Time, and each
  was contained within a world one dimension larger. The self was composed of
  various observers, the normal one being confined to a small field of sensory
  phenomena, observed or remembered. But this field was included in a larger
  field and, to the observer in the latter, future events were visible as well
  as past and present.</p>

  <p>In sleep, he went on, where the attention was not absorbed, as it was in
  waking life, with the smaller field of phenomena, the larger field might come
  inside the pale of consciousness. People had often been correctly forewarned
  in dreams. We all now and then were amazed at the familiarity with which we
  regarded a novel experience, as if we recognised it as something which had
  happened before. The universe was extended in Time, and the dreamer, with
  nothing to rivet his attention to the narrow waking field, ranged about, and
  might light on images which belonged to the future as well as to the past.
  The sleeper was constantly crossing the arbitrary frontier which our mortal
  limitations had erected.</p>

  <p>At this point I began to see light. I was prepared to assent to the
  conclusion that in dreams we occasionally dip into the future, though I was
  unable to follow most of the Professor's proofs. But now came the real
  question. Was it possible to attain to this form of prevision otherwise than
  in sleep? Could the observer in the narrow world turn himself by any effort
  of will into the profounder observer in the world of ampler dimensions? Could
  the anticipating power of the dreamer be systematised and controlled, and be
  made available to man in his waking life?</p>

  <p>It could, said the Professor. Such was the result of the researches to
  which he had dedicated the last ten years of his life. It was as a crowning
  proof that he wished an experiment at Flambard.</p>

  <p>I think that he realised how little I had grasped of his exposition of the
  fundamentals of his theory. He undertook it, I fancy, out of his scrupulous
  honesty; he felt bound to put me in possession of the whole argument, whether
  I understood it or not. But, now that he had got down to something concrete
  which I could follow, his manner became feverishly earnest. He patted my knee
  with a large lean hand, and kept thrusting his gaunt face close to mine. His
  writing-pad fell into the lily-pond, but he did not notice it.</p>

  <p>He needed several people for his experiment&mdash;the more the better, for
  he wanted a variety of temperaments, and he said something, too, about the
  advantage of a communal psychical effort... But they must be the right kind
  of people&mdash; people with highly developed nervous systems&mdash;not men
  too deeply sunk in matter. (I thought of Evelyn and the Lamingtons and old
  Folliot.) He deprecated exuberant physical health or abounding vitality,
  since such endowments meant that their possessors would be padlocked to the
  narrower sensory world. He ran over his selection again, dwelling on each,
  summing each up with what seemed to me astounding shrewdness, considering
  that he had met them for the first time two days before. He wanted the hungry
  and the forward-looking. Tavanger and Mayot. "They will never be content," he
  said, "and their hunger is of the spirit, though maybe an earthy spirit... "
  Myself. He turned his hollow eyes on me, but was too polite to particularise
  what my kind of hunger might be... Charles Ottery. "He is unhappy, and that
  means that his hold on the present is loose... " Sally Flambard. "That
  gracious lady lives always sur la branche&mdash;is it not so? She is like a
  bird, and has no heavy flesh to clog her. Assuredly she must be one." Rather
  to my surprise he added Reggie Daker. Reggie's recent concussion, for some
  reason which I did not follow, made him a suitable object... Above all, there
  was Goodeve. He repeated his name with satisfaction, but offered no
  comment.</p>

  <p>I asked him what form his experiment would take.</p>

  <p>"A little training. No more. A little ascesis, partly of the body, but
  mainly of the mind. It must be disciplined to see what it shall see."</p>

  <p>Then, speaking very slowly, and drawing words apparently from as deep a
  cavern as that from which he drew his breath, he explained his plan.</p>

  <p>There must be a certain physical preparation. I am as unlearned in medical
  science as in philosophy, but I gathered that recently there had been some
  remarkable advances made in the study of the brain and its subsidiary organs.
  Very likely I am writing nonsense, for the Professor at this point forgot
  about tempering the wind to the shorn lamb, and poured forth a flood of
  technicalities. But I understood him to say that, just as the cortex of the
  brain was the seat of the intellectual activities, so the subcortical region
  above the spinal cord was the home of the instinctive faculties. He used a
  lot of jargon, which, not being an anatomist, I could not follow, but he was
  obliging enough to draw me a diagram in his pocket-book, the writing-pad
  being in the lily-pond.</p>

  <p>In particular there was a thing which he called an "intercalated cell,"
  and which had a very special importance in his scheme. Just as the faculty of
  sight, he said, had for its supreme function the creation of an extended
  world, a world of space perception, so the instinct which had its seat in
  this cell specialised in time-perception... I had been reading lately about
  telegnosis, and mentioned that word, but he shook his head impatiently. The
  faculty he spoke of had nothing to do with telegnosis. "You have not
  understood my exposition," he said. "But no matter. It is enough if you
  understand my purpose."</p>

  <p>It was desirable to stimulate the functioning of this cell. That could
  only be done in a small degree. A certain diet was necessary, for he had
  discovered that the cell was temporarily atrophied by the wrong foods. Also
  there was a drug, which acted upon it directly.</p>

  <p>At this I protested, but he was quick to reassure me. "On my honour," he
  cried, "it is the mildest drug. Its bodily effect is as innocuous as a glass
  of tonic water. But I have proved experimentally that it lulls the other
  faculties, and very slightly stimulates this one of which I speak."</p>

  <p>Then he revealed his main purpose.</p>

  <p>"I am still groping at the edge of mysteries," he said. "My theory I am
  assured is true, but in practice I can only go a very little way. Some day,
  when I am ashes, men will look at the future as easily as today they look out
  of a window at a garden. At present I must be content to exemplify my
  doctrine by small trivial things. I cannot enable you to gaze at a segment of
  life at some future date, and watch human beings going about their business.
  The most I hope for is to show you some simple matter of sense-perception as
  it will be at that date. Therefore I need some object which I am assured will
  be still in existence, and which I am also assured will have changed from
  what it now is. Name to me such an object."</p>

  <p>I suggested, rather foolishly, the position of the planets in the sky.</p>

  <p>"That will not do, for now we can predict that position with perfect
  certainty."</p>

  <p>"A young tree?"</p>

  <p>"The visible evidence of change would be too minute. I cannot promise to
  open up the future very far ahead. A year&mdash;two years maybe&mdash;no
  more."</p>

  <p>"A building which we all know, and which is now going up?"</p>

  <p>Again he shook his head. "You may be familiar with the type of the
  completed structure, and carry the picture of it in your memory... There is
  only one familiar object, which continues and likewise changes. You cannot
  guess? Why, a journal. A daily or weekly paper."</p>

  <p>He leaned towards me and laid a hand on each of my knees.</p>

  <p>"Today is the sixth of June. Four days from now, if you and the others
  consent, I will enable you to see for one instant of time&mdash;no
  longer&mdash;a newspaper of the tenth day of June next year."</p>

  <p>He lay back in his chair and had a violent fit of coughing, while I
  digested this startling announcement... He was right on one point&mdash;a
  newspaper was the only thing for his experiment; that at any rate I saw
  clearly. I own to having been tremendously impressed by his talk, but I was
  not quite convinced; the thing appeared to be clean out of nature and reason.
  You see, I had no such stimulus to belief as a scientist would have had who
  had followed his proofs... Still, it seemed harmless. Probably it would end
  in nothing&mdash;the ritual prepared, and the mystics left gaping at each
  other... No. That could scarcely happen, I decided; the mystagogue was too
  impressive.</p>

  <p>The Professor had recovered himself, and was watching me under drooped
  eyelids. All the eagerness had gone out of his face, but that face had the
  brooding power and the ageless wisdom of the Sphinx. If he were allowed to
  make the experiment something must happen.</p>

  <p>Lady Flambard had promised to abide by my decision... There could be no
  risk, I told myself. A little carefulness in diet, which would do everybody
  good. The drug? I would have to watch that. The Professor seemed to read my
  thoughts, for he broke in:</p>

  <p>"You are worrying about the drug? It is of small consequence. If you
  insist, it can be omitted."</p>

  <p>I asked how he proposed to prepare the subjects of his experiment. Quite
  simply, he replied. A newspaper&mdash;The Times, for example&mdash;would be
  made to play a large part in our thoughts... I observed that it already
  played a large part in the thoughts of educated Englishmen, and he
  smiled&mdash;the first time I had seen him smile. There was an air of
  satisfaction about him, as if he knew what my answer would be.</p>

  <p>"I see no objection to what you propose," I said at last. "I warn you that
  I am still a bit of a sceptic. But I am willing, if you can persuade the
  others."</p>

  <p>He smiled again. "With the others there will be no difficulty. Our
  gracious hostess is already an enthusiast. Before luncheon I will speak to Mr
  Tavanger and Mr Mayot&mdash;and to Mr Ottery when he returns. I shall not
  speak to them as I have spoken to you."</p>

  <p>"Why?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Because they are longing for such a revelation as I propose, whereas you
  care not at all. But I would beg of you to say a word on my behalf to Sir
  Robert Goodeve. His co-operation I especially seek."</p>

  <p>He raised with difficulty his huge frame from the wicker chair, blinking
  his eyes in the hot sun, and leaning on a sundial as if he were giddy. I
  offered my arm, which he took, and together we went under the striped awning,
  which shaded one part of the terrace, into the coolness of the great
  hall.</p>

  <p>You know the kind of banality with which, out of shyness, one often winds
  up a difficult conversation. I was moved to observe, as I left him, that in
  four days I hoped to be introduced to a new world. He made no answer. "To
  enter, waking, into the world of sleep," I added fatuously.</p>

  <p>Then he said a thing which rather solemnised me.</p>

  <p>"Not only the world of sleep," he said. "It is the world to which we
  penetrate after death."</p>

  <p>As I watched his great back slowly mounting the staircase, I had a sudden
  feeling that into the peace of Flambard something fateful and tremendous had
  broken.</p><br>

  <h3>IV</h3>

  <p>I do not know what Professor Moe said to Tavanger and Mayot. I knew both
  men, but not intimately, for they were a little too much of the unabashed
  careerist for my taste, and I wondered how, in spite of his confidence, he
  was going to interest their most practical minds.</p>

  <p>After luncheon I wanted to be alone, so I took my rod and went down to the
  Arm, beyond the stretch where it ran among water-meadows.</p>

  <p>It was a still, bright afternoon, with a slight haze to temper the glare
  of the sun. The place was delicious, full of the scents of mint and
  meadowsweet, yellow flag-irises glowing by the water's edge, and the first
  dog-roses beginning to star the hedges. There was not much of a rise, but I
  caught a few trout under the size limit, and stalked and lost a big fellow in
  the mill pool. But I got no good of the summer peace, and my mind was very
  little on fishing, for the talk of the morning made a merry-go-round in my
  head.</p>

  <p>I had moments of considering the whole business a farce, and wondering if
  I had not made a fool of myself in consenting to it. But I could not continue
  long in that mood. The Professor's ardent face would come before me like a
  reproachful schoolmaster's, and under those compelling eyes of his I was
  forced back into something which was acquiescence, if not conviction. There
  was a shadow of anxiety at the back of my mind. The man was an extraordinary
  force, with elemental powers of brain and will; was it wise to let such an
  influence loose on commonplace people who happened to be at the moment a
  little loose from their moorings? I was not afraid of myself, but what about
  the high-strung Sally, and the concussed Reggie, and Charles Ottery in the
  throes of an emotional crisis? I kept telling myself that there was no
  danger, that nothing could happen... And then I discovered, to my amazement,
  that, if that forecast proved true, I should be disappointed. I wanted
  something to happen. Nay, I believed at the bottom of my heart that something
  would happen.</p>

  <p>In the smoking-room, before dinner, I found Charles Ottery and Reggie
  Daker&mdash;a rather pale and subdued Reggie, with a bandage round his head
  and a black eye. They were talking on the window seat, and when I entered
  they suddenly stopped. When they saw who it was, Charles called to me to join
  them.</p>

  <p>"I hear you're in this business, Ned," he said. "I got the surprise of my
  life when the Professor told me that you had consented. It's a new line of
  country for a staid old bird like you."</p>

  <p>"The man's a genius," I replied. "I see no harm in helping him in his
  experiment. Did you understand his argument?"</p>

  <p>"I didn't try. He didn't argue much, but one could see that he had any
  quantity of scientific stuff behind him. He hopes to make us dream while
  we're awake, and I thought it such a sporting proposition that I couldn't
  refuse. It must all be kept deadly secret, of course. We have to get into the
  right atmosphere, and tune our minds to the proper pitch, and it would never
  do to rope in a born idiot like George Lamington. He'd guy it from the
  start."</p>

  <p>"You were convinced by the Professor?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"I won't say convinced. I was interested. It's an amusing game anyhow, and
  I want to be amused."</p>

  <p>Charles spoke with a lightness which seemed to me to be assumed. He had
  obviously been far more impressed than he cared to admit. I could see that,
  since Pamela was giving him a difficult time, he longed for something to
  distract him, something which was associated with that world of new emotions
  in which he was living.</p>

  <p>The lady's other suitor made no concealment. Reggie was honestly excited.
  He was flattered, perhaps, by being made one of the circle, and may have
  attributed his choice to his new role as an authority on books. At last he
  was being taken seriously. Also his recent concussion may have predisposed
  him to some research into the mysteries of mind, for as he explained, he
  could not remember one blessed thing that happened between putting Sir Vidas
  at a fence which he cleared with a yard to spare, and finding himself in bed
  with clouts on his head. He was insistent on the need of confidence in the
  experiment. "What I mean to say is, we've got to help the old boy out. If we
  don't believe the thing will come off, then it won't&mdash;if you see what I
  mean."</p>

  <p>He dropped his voice as Evelyn Flambard and his terriers came noisily into
  the room.</p>

  <p>As I was going upstairs to dress, I found Goodeve's hand on my
  shoulder.</p>

  <p>"I hear you're on in this piece," he whispered jovially, as if the whole
  thing was a good joke.</p>

  <p>"And you?" I whispered back.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I'm on. I rather like these psychical adventures. I'm a hopeless
  subject, you know, and calculated to break up any séance. I haven't got
  enough soul&mdash;too solidly tied to earth. But I never mind offering myself
  as a victim."</p>

  <p>He laughed and passed into his bedroom, leaving me wondering how the
  Professor had so signally failed with the man who was his special choice. He
  had obtained Goodeve's consent, so there was no need of pressure from me, but
  clearly he had not made any sort of convert of him.</p>

  <p>At dinner we all tried to behave as if nothing special was afoot, and I
  think we succeeded. George Lamington had never had so good an audience for
  his dreary tales. He was full of racing reminiscences, the point of which was
  the preternatural cunning with which he had outwitted sundry rivals who had
  tried to beguile him. I never knew anyone whose talk was so choked with
  adipose tissue, but he generally managed to wallow towards some kind of
  point, which he and Evelyn found dramatic... During most of the meal I talked
  to his wife. She could be intelligent enough when she chose, and had a
  vigorous interest in foreign affairs, for she was an Ambassador's daughter.
  When I first knew her she had affected a foreign accent, and professed to be
  more at home in Paris and Vienna than in London. Now she was English of the
  English, and her former tastes appeared only in intermittent attempts to get
  George appointed to a Dominion Governorship, where he would most certainly
  have been a failure. For the present, however, the drums and trumpets did not
  sound for her. The recent addition to the Lamington fortunes had plunged her
  deep in the upholstery of life. She was full of plans for doing up their
  place in Suffolk, and, as I am as ignorant as a coal-heaver about
  bric-à-brac, I could only listen respectfully. She had the mannerism of the
  very rich, whose grievance is not against the price of things, but the
  inadequacy of the supply.</p>

  <p>The Professor's health appeared to have improved, or it may have been
  satisfaction with his initial success, for he was almost loquacious. He
  seemed to have acute hearing, for he would catch fragments of conversation
  far down the table, and send his great voice booming towards the speaker in
  some innocent interrogation. As I have said, his English was excellent, but
  his knowledge of English life seemed to be on the level of a South Sea
  islander. He was very inquisitive, and asked questions about racing and
  horses which gave Evelyn a chance to display his humour. Among the younger
  people he was a great success. Pamela Brune, who sat next to him, lost in his
  company her slight air of petulance and discontent, and became once again the
  delightful child I had known. I was obliged to admit that the Flambard party
  had improved since yesterday, for certain of its members seemed to have
  shaken off their listlessness.</p>

  <p>While youth was dancing or skylarking on the terrace, and the rest were
  set solidly to bridge, we met in the upper chamber in the Essex wing, which
  had been given me as a sitting-room. At first, while we waited for the
  Professor, we were a little self-conscious. Tavanger and Mayot, especially,
  looked rather like embarrassed elders at a children's party. But I noticed
  that no one&mdash;not even Reggie Daker&mdash;tried to be funny about the
  business.</p>

  <p>The Professor's coming turned us into a most practical assembly. Without a
  word of further explanation he gave us our marching orders. He appeared to
  assume that we were all ready to surrender ourselves to his directions.</p>

  <p>The paper chosen was The Times. For the next three days we were to keep
  our minds glued to that news-sheet, and he was very explicit about the way in
  which we were to do it.</p>

  <p>First of all, we were to have it as much as possible before our eyes, so
  that its physical form became as familiar to each of us as our razors and
  cigarette cases. We started, of course, with a considerable degree of
  knowledge, for we were all accustomed to look at it every morning. I remember
  wondering why the Professor had fixed so short a time as three days for this
  intensive contemplation, till he went on to give his further orders.</p>

  <p>This ocular familiarity was only the beginning. Each of us must
  concentrate on one particular part to which his special interest was
  pledged&mdash;Tavanger on the first City page, for example, Mayot on the
  leader page, myself on the Law Reports&mdash;any part we pleased. Of such
  pages we had to acquire the most intimate knowledge, so that by shutting our
  eyes we could reconstruct the make-up in every detail. The physical make-up,
  that is to say; there was no necessity for any memorising of contents.</p>

  <p>Then came something more difficult. Each of us had to perform a number of
  exercises in concentration and anticipation. We knew the kind of things which
  were happening, and within limits the kind of topic which would be the staple
  of the next day's issue. Well, we had to try to forecast some of the contents
  of the next day's issue, which we had not seen. And not merely in a general
  sense. We had to empty our minds of everything but the one topic, and
  endeavour to make as full as possible a picture of part of the exact contents
  of The Times next morning&mdash;to see it not as a concept but as a
  percept&mdash;the very words and lines and headings.</p>

  <p>For example. Suppose that I took the Law Reports pages. There were some
  cases the decisions on which were being given by the House of Lords today,
  and would be published tomorrow. I could guess the members of the tribunal
  who would deliver judgement, and could make a fair shot at what that
  judgement would be. Well, I was to try so to forecast these coming pages that
  I could picture the column of type, and, knowing the judges' idiosyncrasies,
  see before my eyes the very sentences in which their wisdom would be
  enshrined... Tavanger, let us say, took the first City page. Tomorrow he knew
  there would be a report of a company meeting in which he was interested. He
  must try to get a picture of the paragraph in which the City Editor commented
  on the meeting... If Mayot chose the leader page, he must try to guess
  correctly what would be the subject of the first or second leader, and, from
  his knowledge of The Times policy and the style of its leader-writers,
  envisage some of the very sentences, and possibly the headings.</p>

  <p>It seemed to me an incredibly difficult game, and I did not believe that,
  for myself, I would get any results at all. I have never been much good at
  guessing. But I could see the general lay-out. Everything would depend upon
  the adequacy of the knowledge we started with. To make an ocular picture
  which would have any exactitude, I must be familiar with the Lord
  Chancellor's mannerisms, Tavanger with the mentality and the style of the
  City Editor, and Mayot with the policy of the paper and the verbal felicities
  of its leader-writers... Some of us found the prescription difficult, and
  Reggie Daker groaned audibly.</p>

  <p>But there was more to follow. We were also to try to fling our minds
  farther forward&mdash;not for a day, but for a year. Each morning at
  seven&mdash;I do not know why he fixed that hour&mdash;we were to engage in a
  more difficult kind of concentration&mdash;by using such special knowledge as
  we possessed to help us to forecast the kind of development in the world
  which June of next year would show. And always we had to aim at seeing our
  forecasts not in vague concepts, but in concrete black and white in the
  appropriate corner of The Times.</p>

  <p>I am bound to say that, when I heard this, I felt that we had been let in
  for a most futile quest. We had our days mapped out in a minute
  programme&mdash;certain hours for each kind of concentration. We would meet
  the Professor in my sitting-room at stated times... I think that he felt the
  atmosphere sceptical, for on this last point his manner lost its briskness
  and he became very solemn.</p>

  <p>"It is difficult," he said, "but you must have faith. And I myself will
  help you. Time&mdash;all time&mdash;is with us NOW, but we are confined to
  narrow fields of presentation. With my help you will enlarge these fields. If
  you will give me honestly all your powers, I can supplement them."</p>

  <p>Lastly he spoke of the necessary régime. Too much exercise was forbidden,
  for it was desirable that our health should be rather an absence of ailments
  than a positive, aggressive well-being. There were to be no cold baths. We
  might smoke, but alcohol was strictly forbidden&mdash;not much of a hardship,
  for we were an abstemious lot. As to diet, we had to behave like
  convalescents&mdash;no meat, not even fish&mdash; nothing which, in the
  Professor's words, "possessed automobility." We were allowed weak tea, but
  not coffee. Milk, cheese, fruit, eggs and cereals were to be our staples.</p>

  <p>It all reminded me rather eerily of the ritual food which used to be given
  to human beings set apart for sacrifice to the gods.</p>

  <p>"Our gracious hostess has so arranged it that the others will not be
  curious," said the Professor, and Sally nodded a mystified head.</p>

  <p>I went to bed feeling that I should probably get a liver attack from lack
  of exercise, if I did not starve from lack of food. Next morning I found a
  Times on the tray which brought my morning tea. Sally must have sent ten
  miles to a main-line station to get it.</p><br>

  <h3>V</h3>

  <p>It is difficult to write the consecutive story of the next three days. I
  kept a diary, but on consulting it, I find only a bare record of my hours of
  meditation on that confounded newspaper, and of our conferences with the
  Professor. I began in a mood which was less one of scepticism than of
  despair. I simply did not believe that I could get one step forward in this
  preposterous business. But I was determined to play the game to the best of
  my capacity, for Moe's talk last night had brought me fairly under his
  spell.</p>

  <p>I did as I had been told. I emptied my mind of every purpose except the
  one. I read the arguments in the case&mdash;it was an appeal by an insurance
  company&mdash;and then sat down to forecast what the report of the judgement
  would be, as given by The Times next day. Of the substance of the judgement I
  had not much doubt, and I was pretty certain that it would be delivered by
  the Lord Chancellor, with the rest of the Court concurring. I knew Boland's
  style, having listened often enough to his pronouncements, and it would have
  been easy enough to forecast the kind of thing he would say, using some of
  his pet phrases. But my job was to forecast what The Times reporters would
  make him say&mdash;a very different matter. I collected a set of old copies
  of the paper and tried to get into their spirit. Then I made a number of
  jottings, but I found myself slipping into the manner of the official Law
  Reports, which was not what I wanted. I remember looking at my notes with
  disfavour, and reflecting that this guessing game was nothing but a deduction
  from existing knowledge. If I had made a close study of The Times reports, I
  should probably get a good deal right, but since I had only a superficial
  knowledge I would get little. Moe's grandiose theories about Time had nothing
  to do with it. It was not a question of casting the mind forward into a new
  field of presentation, but simply of a good memory from which one made the
  right deductions.</p>

  <p>After my first attempt I went for a walk, and tried to fix my mind on
  something different. I had been making a new rock-garden at Borrowby, and I
  examined minutely Sally's collection of Tibetan alpines. On my return the
  butler handed me a note. The Professor had decided to have conferences with
  each of us separately, and my hour was three in the afternoon.</p>

  <p>Before that hour I had two other bouts of contemplation. I wrestled
  honourably with the incurably evasive, and filled several sheets of foolscap
  with notes. Then I revised them, striking out phrases which were natural
  enough to Boland, but unsuitable for a newspaper summary. The business seemed
  more ridiculous than ever. I was simply chewing the cud of
  memories&mdash;very vague, inexact memories.</p>

  <p>The Professor received me in Sally's boudoir. Now, the odd thing was that
  in his presence I had no self-consciousness. If anyone had told me that I
  should have been unburdening my mind in a ridiculous game to a queer
  foreigner, with the freedom of a novice in the confessional, I should have
  declared it impossible. But there it was. He sat before me with his gaunt
  face and bottomless pits of eyes, very grave and gentle, and without being
  asked I told him what I had been doing.</p>

  <p>"That is a beginning," he said, "only a beginning. But your mind is too
  active as yet to <i>perceive</i>. You are still in the bonds of
  ratiocination. Your past knowledge is only the jumping-off stage from which
  your mind must leap. Suffer yourself to be more quiescent, my friend. Do not
  torture your memory. It is a deep well from which the reason can only draw
  little buckets of water."</p>

  <p>I told him that I had been making notes, and he approved. "But do not
  shape them as you would shape a logical argument. Let them be raw material
  out of which a picture builds itself. Your business is perception, not
  conception, and perception comes in flashes." And then he quoted what
  Napoleon had once said, how after long pondering he had his vision of a
  battle plan in a blinding flash of white light.</p>

  <p>He said a great deal more which I do not remember very clearly. But one
  thing I have firm in my recollection&mdash;the compelling personality of the
  man. There must have been some strange hypnotic force about him, for as he
  spoke I experienced suddenly a new confidence and an odd excitement. He
  seemed to wake unexpected powers in me, and I felt my mind to be less a
  machine clamped to a solid concrete base, than an aeroplane which might rise
  and soar into space. Another queer thing&mdash;I felt slightly giddy as I
  left him. Unquestionably he was going to make good his promise and supplement
  our efforts, for an influence radiated from him, more masterful than any I
  have ever known in a fellow mortal. It was only after we had parted that the
  reaction came, and I felt a faint sense of antagonism, almost of fear.</p>

  <p>In my last effort before dinner I struggled to follow his advice. I tried
  to picture next day's Times. The judgement, from its importance, would occupy
  a column at least; I saw that column and its heading, and it seemed to me to
  be split up into three paragraphs. I saw some of the phrases out of my notes,
  and one or two new ones. There was one especially, quite in Boland's manner,
  which seemed to be repeated more than once&mdash;something like this: "It is
  a legal commonplace that a contract of insurance is one uberrimae fidei,
  which is vitiated by any nondisclosure, however innocent, of material facts."
  I scribbled this down, and found, when I re-read it, that I had written
  uberrimi, and deplored my declining scholarship.</p>

  <p>At dinner our group were as glum as owls. I did not know how the Professor
  had handled the others, but I assumed that his methods had been the same as
  with me, and certainly he had produced an effect. We all seemed to have
  something on our minds, and came in for a good deal of chaff, the more as we
  refrained from so many dishes. Reggie Daker escaped, for he was a
  convalescent, but Evelyn had a good deal to say about Goodeve's abstinence.
  Goodeve was supposed to be entering for a tennis contest which the young
  people had got up, while George Lamington started the legend that I was
  reducing my weight for the next Bar point-to-point. Happily this interest in
  our diet diverted their attention from our manners, which must have been
  strange. All seven of us were stricken with aphasia, and for myself I felt
  that I was looking on at a movie-show.</p>

  <p>The Professor gathered us together in my sitting-room a little before
  midnight. As I looked at the others I had an impression of a kindergarten.
  Compared with him we all seemed ridiculously young, crude, and ignorant.
  Mayot's alert intelligence was only the callow vivacity of a child;
  Tavanger's heavy face was merely lumpish; even Goodeve looked the bright
  schoolboy. As for Sally and Reggie and Charles Ottery, something had happened
  to them which drained the personality from their faces, and made them seem
  slight and wispish. Moe himself brooded over us like a vital Buddha. I had an
  uneasy sense of looking at a man who lived most of his time in another world
  than ours.</p>

  <p>He did not instruct us; he talked, and his talk was like a fierce cordial.
  Looking back at what I can remember of it, it does not seem to make any kind
  of sense, but it had an overwhelming effect on his hearers. It was as if he
  were drawing aside curtain after curtain, and, though we could not see into
  the land beyond the curtains, we were convinced of its existence. As I have
  said, I cannot make sense of my recollection of it, but while I was listening
  it seemed to be quite simple and intelligible...</p>

  <p>He spoke of the instinct which gave perceptions, and of its immense power
  as compared to our petty reason which turned percepts into concepts. He spoke
  of what he called the "eye of the mind," and said the very phrase pointed to
  some intuition in the ordinary being of a gift which civilisation had
  atrophied... Then Reggie Daker became important. The Professor elicited from
  the coy Reggie that in his childhood he had been in the habit of seeing
  abstract things in a concrete form. For Reggie the different days of the week
  had each a special shape, and each of the Ten Commandments a special colour.
  Monday was a square and Saturday an oval, and Sunday a circle with a segment
  bitten out; the Third Commandment was dark blue, and the Tenth a pale green
  with spots. Reggie had thought of Sin as a substance like black salt, and the
  Soul as something in the shape of a kidney bean...</p>

  <p>It all sounds the wildest nonsense, but the Professor made out of Reggie's
  confidences a wonderful thing. His images might seem ridiculous, but they
  showed perception struggling to regain its rightful place. He had some theory
  of the relation between the concrete vision and the abstract thought, which
  he linked somehow or other to his doctrine of Time. In the retrospect I
  cannot remember his argument, but he convinced me absolutely... He had a lot
  to say about the old astrologers and magic-makers who worked with physical
  charms and geometrical figures, and he was clear that they had had a
  knowledge of mysteries on which the door had long been locked. Also he talked
  about certain savage beliefs in ancient Greece and in modern
  Africa&mdash;which he said were profundity and not foolishness... He spoke,
  too, about the world of dreams, and how its fantasy had often a deeper
  reality than waking life. "We are children on the seashore," he said,
  "watching the jetsam of the waves, and every fragment of jetsam is a clue to
  a land beyond the waters which is our true home."</p>

  <p>Not for a moment did any of us think him mad. We sat like beggars,
  hungrily picking up crumbs from a feast. Of one thing I was presently
  convinced. Moe had cast a stronger spell over the others than over myself. I
  found my mind trying feebly to question some of his sayings, to link them
  with the ordinary world of thought; but it was plain that the rest accepted
  everything as inspired and infallible gospel.</p>

  <p>I dare say I was tired, for I slept more soundly than I had done for
  weeks. I was called at seven, and set myself, according to instructions, to a
  long-range forecast&mdash;what would be likely to happen on June tenth a year
  ahead. It sounds a futile job, and so I found it. My head soon grew dizzy
  with speculations, some of them quite outside the legal sphere which I had
  marked out as my own. But I found one curious thing. I had lost the
  hopelessness which had accompanied my contemplations of the previous day. I
  BELIEVED now that I could make something of the task. Also I found my
  imagination far more lively. I convinced myself that in a year's time there
  would be a new Lord Chancellor and a new Lord of Appeal. I beheld them
  sitting in the Lords, but the figure on the Woolsack was so blurred that I
  could not recognise it. But I saw the new Lord clearly, and his face was the
  face of young Molsom, who had only taken silk two years ago. Molsom's
  appointment was incredible, but, as often as the picture of the scarlet
  benches of the Upper House came before me, there was Molsom, with his dapper
  little figure and his big nose and his arms folded after his habit. I
  realised that I was beginning to use the "mind's eye," to see things, and not
  merely to think them.</p>

  <p>The Times was brought to my bedside at eight, and I opened it eagerly.
  There was the judgement in my case, delivered, as I had expected, by Boland.
  It ran not to a whole column, but to less than three-quarters; but I had been
  right on one point&mdash;it was broken up into three paragraphs. The
  substance of the judgement was much as I had foreseen, but I had not been
  lucky in guessing the wording, and Boland had referred to only two of the
  cases I had marked down for him...</p>

  <p>But there was one amazing thing. He had used the sentence about uberrimae
  fidei&mdash;very much in the form I had anticipated. More&mdash;far more. The
  Times had that rare thing, a misprint: it had uberrimi, the very blunder I
  had made myself in my anticipatory jottings.</p>

  <p>This made me feel solemn. My other correct anticipations might be set down
  to deductions from past knowledge. But here was an indubitable instance of
  anticipatory perception.</p>

  <p>From that hour I date my complete conversion. I was as docile now as
  Sally, and I stopped trying to reason. For I understood that, behind all the
  régime and the exercises, there was the tremendous fact of Professor Moe
  himself. If we were to look into the future it must be largely through his
  eyes. By the sheer power of intellect he had won a gift, and by some
  superabundant force of personality he was able to communicate in part that
  gift to others.</p>

  <p>I am not going to attempt to write in detail the story of the next two
  days, because external detail matters little; the true history was being made
  in the heads of the seven of us. I went obediently through the prescribed
  ritual. I pored over The Times as if my salvation depended upon it. I
  laboured to foresee the next day's issue, and I let my mind race into the
  next year. I felt my imagination becoming more fecund and more vivid, and my
  confidence growing hourly. And always I felt behind me some mighty impetus
  driving me on and holding me up. I was in the charge of a Moses, like the
  puzzled Israelites stumbling in the desert.</p>

  <p>I spent the intervals with a rod beside the Arm, and there I first became
  conscious of certain physical symptoms. An almost morbid nervous alertness
  was accompanied by a good deal of bodily lassitude. This could not be due
  merely to the diet and lack of exercise, for I had often been sedentary for a
  week on end and lived chiefly on bread and cheese. Rather it seemed that I
  was using my nervous energy so lavishly in one direction that I had little
  left for the ordinary purposes of life... Another thing. My sight is very
  good, especially for long distances, and in dry-fly fishing I never need to
  use a glass to spot a fish. Well, in the little fishing I did that day, I
  found my eyes as good as ever, but I noted one remarkable defect. I saw the
  trout perfectly clearly, but I could not put a fly neatly over him. There was
  nothing wrong with my casting; the trouble was in my eye, which had somehow
  lost its liaison with the rest of my body. The fly fell on the water as
  lightly as thistledown, but it was many inches away from the fish's nose.</p>

  <p>That day the Professor made us fix our minds principally on the lay-out of
  June tenth, next year. He wanted to have that date orientated for us with
  relation to other recurrent events&mdash; the Derby, Ascot, the third reading
  of the Budget, the conference of Empire Journalists and so forth. Also he
  provided us with sheets of blank paper, the size of The Times, which were to
  be, so to speak, the screen on which the magic lantern of our prevision cast
  its picture. He was very careful, almost fussy, about this business. The
  sheets had nothing printed on them, but they had to be exactly right in size,
  and he rejected the first lot that Sally provided.</p>

  <p>But I cannot say that I paid much attention to these or any other details.
  I was in a mood of utter obedience, simply doing what I was told to do to the
  best of my power. I was in the grip of a power which I had no desire to
  question, and which by some strong magic was breaking down walls for me and
  giving me a new and marvellous freedom. For there was no doubt about
  it&mdash;I could now set my mind at will racing into the future, and placing
  before me panoramas which might or might not be true, but which had all the
  concrete sharpness of reality. There were moments when I seemed almost to
  feel one sphere of presentation give place to another, as the driver of a car
  changes gear.</p>

  <p>Dinner that night&mdash;Sally had sent the Professor to bed after
  tea&mdash;was as lively as the meal of the previous evening had been
  dull&mdash;lively, that is, for the rest of the party, not for us seven. For
  we seven suddenly developed a remarkable capacity for making sport for the
  populace, by a kind of mental light-heartedness, similar to my clumsiness
  with the trout. Our minds seemed to have jolted out of focus. There is a
  species of bêtise, which I believe at Cambridge is named after some don, and
  which consists in missing completely the point of a metaphor or a joke, in
  setting the heavy heel of literalness on some trivial flower of fancy. It is
  a fault to which the Scots are supposed to be prone, and it is the staple of
  most of the tales against that nation. The classic instance is Charles Lamb's
  story of how he was once present at a dinner given in honour of Burns, at
  which a nephew of the poet was to be present. As the company waited on the
  arrival of the guest, Lamb remarked that he wished the uncle were coming
  instead of the nephew: upon which several solemn Scotsmen arose to inform him
  that that was impossible, because Burns was dead.</p>

  <p>That night we seven became unconscious Caledonians. Reggie Daker began it,
  by asking a ridiculous question about a story of Evelyn's. At first Evelyn
  looked wrathful, suspecting irony, and then, realising Reggie's
  guilelessness, he turned the laugh against that innocent. The extraordinary
  thing was that we all did it. Sally was the worst, and Charles Ottery a good
  second. Even Mayot fell into the trick&mdash;Mayot, who had a reputation for
  a quick and caustic wit. George Lamington was talking politics. "A Bengali
  Cabinet in England," George began, and was interrupted by Mayot with, "But,
  hang it, man, there's no Bengali Cabinet in England!" The fact that I noted
  our behaviour would seem to prove that I was not so deeply under the spell as
  the others.</p>

  <p>We made sport, as I have said, for the company, and some of them enjoyed
  the pleasant sense of superiority which comes when people who have a
  reputation for brains make fools of themselves. Yet the mirth struck me as a
  little uneasy. There was a sense somewhere that all was not well, that odd
  things were going on beneath the surface. Pamela Brune, I remember, let her
  eyes rest on Charles Ottery as she left the room, and in those eyes I read
  bewilderment, almost pain.</p>

  <p>Next morning we began the drug. There were in all three doses&mdash;the
  first with morning tea, the second at three in the afternoon, and the third
  after dinner. For myself I felt no particular effects, but I can testify that
  that day, the last day of our preparation, my mood changed.</p>

  <p>For the first time I found some dregs of fear in my mind. My confidence in
  Moe was in no way abated, but I began to feel that we were moving on the edge
  of things, not mysterious only but terrible. My first cause for uneasiness
  was the Professor himself. When I met him that morning I was staggered by his
  looks. His colour was like white wax, and the gauntness of his face was such
  that it seemed that not only flesh had gone but muscle and blood, so that
  there remained only dead skin stretched tight over dead bone. His eyes were
  alive, and no longer placid pools, but it was a sick life, and coughing shook
  him as an autumn wind shakes the rafters of a ruined barn. He professed to be
  well enough, but I realised that his experiment was draining his scanty
  strength. The virtue was going out of him into us, and I wondered if before
  the appointed time the dynamo might not fail us.</p>

  <p>My other anxiety was Goodeve. He had begun by being the most sceptical of
  the lot of us, but I noticed that at each conference with Moe he grew more
  silent, his face more strained, and his eyes more unquiet. There was now
  something positively furtive in them, as if he were in dread of some menace
  springing out at him from ambush. He hung upon the Professor's words with
  dog-like devotion, very odd in a personality so substantial and well defined.
  By tacit consent none of us ever spoke of the experiment, as if we felt that
  any communication among ourselves might weaken the strong effluence from our
  leader's mind, so I could not put out any feelers. But the sight of Goodeve
  at luncheon increased my lurking fear that we were getting very near the edge
  of some indefinable danger.</p>

  <p>I felt very drowsy all day, and dozed in a garden chair between the
  exercises. I usually dream a good deal of nights, but now I slept like a
  log&mdash;which may have been due to nervous fatigue, or more likely to the
  switching of the dream-world over into the waking hours. The strangest thing
  about the whole experience was that I never felt one moment of boredom. I was
  doing something infinitely monotonous, and yet my powers bent themselves to
  it as readily as if every moment were a new excitement. That, too, rather
  frightened me. If this stimulus was so potent for a flat nature like mine,
  what must be its power over more mercurial souls?</p>

  <p>I must record what happened at tea. Nearly all the guests were there, and
  a cheerful party of young people had come over from a neighbouring house. Now
  Sally had a much-loved terrier, a Dandie Dinmont called Andrew, who had been
  on a visit to the vet and had only returned that afternoon. Andrew appeared
  when tea was beginning, and was received by his mistress with every kind of
  endearment. But Andrew would not go near her; he fled, knocking over a table,
  and took refuge between Evelyn's legs, and nothing would draw him from his
  sanctuary. He used to be a friend of mine, but he met my advances with a snap
  and the most dismal howling. There he stood, pressed against Evelyn's shins,
  his teeth bared, his big head lowered and bristling. He seemed to have no
  objection to the others, only to Sally and me. Then Mayot came in with
  Tavanger, and again Andrew wailed to the skies. Charles Ottery and Reggie
  received the same greeting; Goodeve, too, who sat down next to Evelyn, and
  thereby drove Andrew yelping to a corner. After that he recovered a little
  and accepted a bit of bread and butter from Pamela Brune, by whose side he
  had ensconced himself. I was deeply interested in the whole performance, for
  it was not humanity that Andrew disliked, but that section of it which was
  engaged in the experiment. I was pondering on this marvel, when there came a
  howl like nothing on earth, and I saw Andrew streaking out of the
  drawing-room, slithering over rugs and barging into stools, with Evelyn after
  him. I also saw that Moe had just entered by another door, looking like a
  death-in-life.</p>

  <p>The Professor sat himself by me, and drank his tea thirstily. The tiny cup
  seemed almost too great a weight for the mighty hand to raise. He turned to
  me with the ghost of a smile.</p>

  <p>"That dog pays tribute to our success," he said. "The animal has instinct
  and the man reason, and on those terms they live together. Let a man attain
  instinct and the animal will flee from him. I have noted it before."</p>

  <p>Some neighbours came to dinner, so we made a big party, and the silent
  conclave passed unnoticed, though Sally's partner must have wondered what had
  become of her famous sparkle, for she was the palest and mutest of spectres.
  I felt myself an observer set at a distance not only from the ordinary
  members of the party but from our coterie&mdash;which proves that I must have
  been less under Moe's spell than my companions. For example, I could not only
  watch with complete detachment the behaviour of the cheerful young people,
  and listen to George Lamington's talk of his new Lancia, but I could observe
  from without Sally's absent-mindedness and stammered apologies, and Goodeve's
  look of unhappy expectation, and Charles Ottery's air of one struggling with
  something on the edge of memory, and Tavanger's dry lips&mdash;the man drank
  pints of water. One thing I noticed. They clearly hated those outside our
  group. Sally would shrug her shoulders as if unbearably tried, and Mayot
  looked murderously now and then at Evelyn, and Charles Ottery, who sat next
  to Pamela Brune, regarded her with hard eyes. I was conscious of something of
  the same sort myself, for most of my fellows had come to look to me like
  chattering mannikins. They bored me, but I did not feel for them the
  overwhelming distaste which was only too apparent in the other members of the
  group. Their attitude was the opposite of Miranda's cry&mdash;</p>

  <p>"O brave new world That has such people in't."</p>

  <p>I doubt if they thought the world brave, and for certain they had no
  illusion about its inhabitants.</p>

  <p>It was a very hot night, and I went out beyond the terrace to sniff the
  fragrance of Sally's rock garden. As I sat dangling my legs over the parapet
  I felt a hand on my arm, and turned to find Pamela Brune.</p>

  <p>"Come for a walk, Uncle Ned," she said. "I want to talk to you."</p>

  <p>She slipped her arm through mine, and we went down the long alley between
  yews at the end of the Dutch garden. I felt her arm tremble, and when she
  spoke it was in a voice which she strove to make composed.</p>

  <p>"What has happened to you all?" she asked. "I thought this Whitsuntide was
  going to be such fun, and it began well&mdash; and now everybody is behaving
  so oddly, Sally hasn't smiled for two days, and Reggie is more half-witted
  than ever, and you look most of the time as if you were dropping off to
  sleep."</p>

  <p>"I am pretty tired," I replied.</p>

  <p>"Oh yes, I know," she said impatiently. "There are excuses for
  you&mdash;and for Sally perhaps, for she has been overdoing it badly... But
  there is a perfect epidemic of bad manners abroad. Tonight at dinner I could
  have boxed Charles Ottery's ears. He was horribly rude."</p>

  <p>"You haven't been very kind to him," I said lamely.</p>

  <p>She withdrew her hand.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean? I have always been civil... and he has been very, very
  unkind to me... I hate him. I'll never speak to him again."</p>

  <p>Pamela fled from me down the shadowed alley like a nymph surprised by Pan,
  and I knew that she fled that I might not see her tears.</p>

  <p>Later that night we had our last conference with Moe, for next morning at
  seven in my sitting-room we were to meet for the final adventure. It was a
  short conference, and all he seemed to do was to tighten the cords with which
  he had bound us. I felt his influence more sharply than ever, but I was not
  in such perfect thraldom as the others, for with a little fragment of my mind
  I could still observe and think objectively...</p>

  <p>I observed the death-mask of the Professor. That is the only word by which
  to describe his face. Every drop of blood seemed to have fled from it, and in
  his deep pits of eyes there was no glimmer of life. It was a mask of death,
  but it was also a mask of peace. In that I think lay its compelling power.
  There was no shadow of unrest or strife or doubt in it. It had been purged of
  human weakness as it had been drained of blood. I remembered "grey-haired
  Saturn, quiet as a stone."</p>

  <p>I thought&mdash;what did I think? I kept trying as a desperate duty to
  make my mind function a little on its own account. I cast it back over the
  doings of the past days, but I could not find a focus... I was aware that
  somehow I had acquired new and strange gifts. I had become an adept at
  prospecting the immediate future, for, though I made many blunders, I had had
  an amazing percentage of successes. But the Professor did not set much store
  apparently by this particular expertise, and my main task had been long-range
  forecasts a year ahead. These, of course, could not be verified, but I had
  managed to create a segment of a future world as shot with colour and as
  diversified with incident as the world of sense around me...</p>

  <p>About that there were some puzzles which I could not solve. In guessing
  the contents of the next day's Times I had a mass of concrete experience to
  build on, but I had not that experience to help me in constructing what might
  happen across the space of a year, with all a year's unaccountable chances
  ... Then I reflected that the power of short-range forecasts had come in only
  a small degree from the exercise of my reason upon past experience. That was
  but a dim light: it was the daemonic power of the Professor's mind which had
  given me those illuminations. Could the strong wings of that spirit carry
  seven humdrum folk over the barriers of sense and habit into a new far world
  of presentation?</p>

  <p>That was my last thought before I fell asleep, and I remember that I felt
  a sudden horror. We were feeding like parasites upon something on which lay
  the shadow of dissolution.</p><br>

  <h3>VI</h3>

  <p>I was up and dressed long before seven. The drug, or the diet, or the
  exercises, or all combined, made me sleepy during the day, but singularly
  alert at first waking. Alert in body, that is&mdash;the feeling that I could
  run a mile in record time, the desire for something to task my bodily
  strength. But my brain these last mornings had not been alert. It had seemed
  a passive stage over which a pageant moved, a pageant of which I had not the
  direction... But this morning the pageant had stopped, the stage was empty,
  or rather it was brooded over by a vast vague disquiet.</p>

  <p>It was a perfect midsummer morning, with that faint haze in the distance
  which means a hot noon. The park under my window lay drenched and silvered
  with dew. The hawthorns seemed to be bowed over the grasses under their
  weight of blossom. The birds were chattering in the ivy, and two larks were
  singing. Just under me, beyond the ha-ha, a foal was standing on tottering
  legs beside its mother, lifting its delicate nozzle to sniff the air. The
  Arm, where the sun caught it, was a silver crescent, and there was a little
  slow drift of amethyst smoke from the head keeper's cottage in a clump of
  firs. The scene was embodied, deep, primordial peace, and though, as I have
  said, my ordinary perception had become a little dulled, the glory of the
  June morning smote me like a blow.</p>

  <p>It wakened a thousand memories, and memories of late had been rare things
  with me... I thought of other such dawns, when I had tiptoed through wet
  meadows to be at the morning rise&mdash; water lilies, and buckbean, and
  arrowhead, and the big trout feeding; dawn in the Alps, when, perched on some
  rock pinnacle below the last ridge of my peak, I had eaten breakfast and
  watched the world heave itself out of dusk into burning colour; a hundred
  hours when I had thanked God that I was alive... A sudden longing woke in me,
  as if these things were slipping away. These joys were all inside the curtain
  of sense and present perception, and now I was feeling for the gap in the
  curtain, and losing them. What mattered the world beyond the gap? Why should
  we reach after that which God had hidden?...</p>

  <p>Fear, distaste, regret chased each other through my mind. Something had
  weakened this morning. Had the mystica catena snapped?... And then I heard a
  movement in my sitting-room, and turned away from the window. My mind might
  be in revolt, but my will was docile.</p>

  <p>We sat in a semicircle round the Professor. It was a small room with
  linen-fold panelling, a carved chimney-piece, and one picture&mdash;a French
  hunting scene. The morning sun was looking into it, so the blinds were
  half-lowered. We sat in a twilight, except in one corner, where the floor
  showed a broad shaft of light. I was next to Sally at the left-hand edge of
  the circle. That is all I remember about the scene, except that each of us
  had a copy of The Times&mdash;not the blank paper we had had before, but that
  morning's Times, the issue for the tenth of June in that year of grace.</p>

  <p>I must have slipped partly out of the spell, for I could use my eyes and
  get some message from them. I dare say I could have understood one of The
  Times leaders. But I realised that the others were different. They could not
  have made sense of one word. To them it was blank white paper, an empty slate
  on which something was about to be written. They had the air of dull, but
  obedient pupils, with their eyes chained to their master.</p>

  <p>The Professor wore a dressing-gown, and sat in the writing-table
  chair&mdash;deathly white, but stirred into intense life. He sat upright,
  with his hands on his knees, and his eyes, even in the gloom, seemed to be
  probing and kneading our souls... I felt the spell, and consciously struggled
  against it. His voice helped my resistance. It was weak and cracked, without
  the fierce vitality of his face.</p>

  <p>"For three minutes you will turn your eyes inward&mdash;into the darkness
  of the mind which I have taught you to make. Then&mdash;I will give the
  sign&mdash;you will look at the paper. There you will see words written, but
  only for one second. Bend all your powers to remember them."</p>

  <p>But my thoughts were not in the darkness of the mind. I looked at the
  paper and saw that I could read the date and the beginning of an
  advertisement. I had broken loose; I was a rebel, and was glad of it. And
  then I looked at Moe, and saw there something which sent a chill to my
  heart.</p>

  <p>The man was dying&mdash;dying visibly. With my eyes I saw the body shrink
  and the jaw loosen as the vital energy ebbed. Now I knew how we might bridge
  the gap of Time. His personality had lifted us out of our world, and, by a
  supreme effort of brain and will, his departing soul might carry us into a
  new one&mdash; for an instant only, before that soul passed into a timeless
  eternity.</p>

  <p>I could see all this, because I had shaken myself free from his spell, yet
  I felt the surge of his spirit like a wind in my face. I heard the word
  "Now," croaked with what must have been his last breath. I saw his huge form
  crumple and slip slowly to the floor. But the eyes of the others did not see
  this; they were on The Times pages.</p>

  <p>All but Sally. The strain had become more than she could bear. With a
  small cry she tilted against my shoulder, and for the few seconds before the
  others returned to ordinary consciousness and realised that Moe was dead, she
  lay swooning in my arms.</p>

  <p>In that fateful moment, while the soul of a genius was quitting the body,
  five men, staring at what had become the simulacrum of a Times not to be
  printed for twelve months, read certain things.</p>

  <p>Mayot had a vision of the leader page, and read two sentences of comment
  on a speech by the Prime Minister. In one sentence the Prime Minister was
  named, and the name was not that of him who then held the office.</p>

  <p>Tavanger, on the first City page, had a glimpse of a note on the formation
  of a great combine, by the Anatilla Corporation, of the michelite-producing
  interests of the world.</p>

  <p>Reggie Daker, on the Court page, saw an account of the departure of an
  archaeological expedition to Yucatan, and his name appeared as one of the
  members.</p>

  <p>Goodeve and Charles Ottery&mdash;the one on the page opposite the leaders
  and the other on the first page of the paper&mdash;read the announcement of
  their own deaths.</p>

  <p class="poem">"For mee (if there be such a thing as I)<br>

  Spies that I beare so well her tyranny,<br>
  That she thinks nothing else so fit for mee."<br>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p>Tavanger's life was a little beyond my beat. Your busy city magnate does
  not dine out a great deal, and as a rule he fights shy of political circles.
  Before that Flambard Whitsuntide I had met him occasionally at public
  dinners, and once I had had to cross-examine him in a case in the Commercial
  Court, and a very tough proposition I found him. I was attracted by something
  solid and dignified in his air, and I thought his taciturnity agreeable; your
  loquacious financier is the dullest of God's creatures. During the early
  autumn I found myself occasionally wondering whether Tavanger had seen
  anything under Moe's spell, for he had had the look of a convinced disciple.
  I was certain that he would play up to whatever vision he had been
  vouchsafed, for your financier is as superstitious as a punter and will act
  boldly on hints which he never attempts to rationalise. Then, in the
  beginning of the Michaelmas term, fortune brought us together.</p>

  <p>I was invited to arbitrate in a case sent me by a firm of city solicitors
  who often briefed me. It concerned the ownership of a parcel of shares in a
  Rhodesian company. Tavanger had bought and paid for them, but there was some
  question about the title, and another party, representing a trust estate, had
  put forward a claim. It was a friendly affair, for the trustees only wished
  to protect themselves, and instead of making a case in court of it they had
  agreed, to save expense, to submit it to me as arbitrator&mdash;a growing
  practice in those days when there was little money to spend on litigation.
  The case, which turned on the interpretation of certain letters and involved
  a fairly obvious point of law, presented no great difficulty. I sat for four
  hours on a Saturday afternoon, and, after a most amicable presentation of
  both sides, I found for Tavanger.</p>

  <p>This happened at the end of October, and interfered with a Saturday to
  Monday which I had meant to spend at Wirlesdon. It upset Tavanger's plans
  also, and, as we were leaving my chambers, he suggested that, since we were
  both left at a loose end, we should dine together. I agreed willingly, for I
  had taken a strong liking to Tavanger. He had given his evidence that
  afternoon with a downright reasonableness which impressed me, and I had
  enjoyed watching his strong, rather sullen face, enlivened by his bright
  humorous eyes. His father, I had been told, had come originally from Geneva,
  but the name had been anglicised to rhyme with "scavenger," and the man
  himself was as typical a Briton as you could picture. He had made a great
  reputation, and, incidentally, a great fortune, by buying wreckage and
  working it up into sound business. In whatever direction he moved he had a
  crowd of followers who trusted his judgement, but they trusted him blindly,
  for he was not communicative. He had done bold things, too, and more than
  once had defied City opinion and won. His name stood high for integrity as
  well as for acumen and courage, but he was not regarded as companionable. He
  was a bachelor, living alone in a big house in Kensington, and his hobbies
  were a hospital, which he ran brilliantly, and his collection of Dutch
  pictures. Nobody claimed to know him well, and I own to having been a little
  flattered when he showed a taste for my company. I had a notion that he might
  want to talk about Moe.</p>

  <p>He didn't, for Flambard was never mentioned. But he had a good deal to
  tell me about the Rhodesian company, the Daphne Concessions, which had been
  the subject of the arbitration. I had observed with some curiosity that he
  had taken special pains to acquire the seventeen thousand ordinary shares,
  and had paid a stiffish price for them, and I had wondered what purpose was
  at the back of his head. For when the papers had first come to me I had
  happened to meet the stockbroker who looked after my investments, and had
  asked him casually about the Daphne company. He had shaken his head over it.
  The shares were not quoted, he told me, and were presumably strongly held,
  but the mine had been going for five years without paying a dividend.
  Personally he did not believe in the future of michelite, but if I wanted a
  gamble there were plenty of shares of the chief producing company, the
  American Anatilla, to be had at round about sixteen shillings.</p>

  <p>I am ashamed to say that I had only a very hazy idea what michelite was,
  and from Tavanger I sought information. I learned that it was a metal used
  chiefly in the manufacture of certain kinds of steel, and that it could also
  be applied to copper and iron. It gave immense hardness and impenetrability,
  and complete freedom from corrosion, and could therefore be used, like
  ferrochrome, for the construction of aeroplanes, projectiles, and
  armour-plates; but the product was less costly than chrome steel and easier
  to work. Tavanger thought that its use must soon be greatly extended,
  especially in the automobile industry. The difficulty lay in smelting the
  ore, a process which required very special fluxes and was still an expensive
  one; nevertheless, in spite of the cost, many industries would find it
  indispensable. It was found in large, but still undefined, quantities in a
  very few areas. In the Urals, of course, the home of all minerals, but there
  the deposits were little worked. In two places in the Balkans and one in
  Transylvania, where the owners were a German company, the Rosas-Sprenger,
  which had been the pioneer in the whole business. In Central
  America&mdash;Nicaragua, I think&mdash;under the Anatilla Corporation. These
  two companies, the Anatilla and the Rosas-Sprenger, virtually controlled the
  product now on the market.</p>

  <p>"Prosperous?" he said in reply to my question. "No, not yet. They live in
  hope. The Anatilla has Glaubsteins behind it, and can afford to wait. The
  Rosas-Sprenger, I fancy, has a bit of a struggle, but they have Sprenger with
  them, who first discovered how to smelt the stuff&mdash;I'm told he is one of
  the greatest living metallurgical chemists. Sooner or later their chance is
  bound to come, unless the engineering trade goes bust altogether."</p>

  <p>"How about our friends of the afternoon?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh, the Daphne is not yet a serious producer. It has always been a bit
  short of working capital. But we have assets the others don't possess. They
  have to mine their ore, and have pretty high working costs, whereas we quarry
  ours&mdash;quarry it out of a range of hills which seems to be made of it.
  Also our stuff is found in a purer form, and the smelting is
  simpler&mdash;not easy or cheap, but easier and cheaper than theirs. When a
  boom comes we shall be in a favourable position... Would you like some
  shares? I daresay it could be managed."</p>

  <p>"No, thank you," I said. "I have no time to watch speculations, so I stick
  to gilt-edged... You have a solid lump of the ordinary stock. Are you looking
  for more?"</p>

  <p>He laughed. "For all I can get. I have taken a sudden fancy to michelite,
  and I usually back my fancies. The mischief is to know where to find the
  shares. Daphnes seem to be held by a legion of small folk up and down the
  world, none of whom want to sell. I have to stalk them like wild deer. You're
  not in this business and won't queer my pitch, so I don't mind telling you
  that I mean to have a controlling interest in Daphnes before I'm many months
  older."</p>

  <p>After that we talked about Hobbema. As I walked back to my rooms I had two
  clear impressions in my mind. One was that I should not like to be up against
  Tavanger in any business on which his heart was set. There was that in the
  set of his jaw and the dancing light in his eyes which made him look
  immensely formidable. The second was that he knew something about the Daphne
  Concession which others did not know, and knew it with absolute certainty. As
  I went to bed it suddenly occurred to me that he might have got this
  knowledge at Flambard, but as to its nature I could make no guess.</p><br>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p>I did not meet Tavanger again till the week after Christmas. An unexpected
  piece of business had brought me up from Devonshire, and it lasted so long
  that I was forced to spend the night in Town. It was that dead patch at the
  end of December when London seems more deserted than in August, and, since I
  felt disinclined to face the howling desert of a club, I dined at the Savoy.
  There I found Tavanger marooned for the same cause. He had been shooting in
  Norfolk, and had been dragged up to an urgent conference.</p>

  <p>He looked a different man from my last recollection of him&mdash;leaner in
  body, thinner in the face, deeply weathered, with the light patches round the
  eyes which you get from long blinking in a strong sun. I asked him what he
  had been doing with himself, and he laughed.</p>

  <p>"Wait till I have ordered my dinner and I'll tell you. I'm short of good
  food and trying to make up for it. I want to get my teeth into decent beef
  again... What about wine? It's cold enough for Burgundy."</p>

  <p>When he had arranged a menu to his satisfaction he began an account of his
  recent doings. It lasted through the meal and long afterwards over a pipe in
  my rooms. Tavanger was a good narrator in his dry way, and instead of an
  evening of sleepy boredom I had excellent entertainment, for I heard a tale
  of activities which few middle-aged men would have ventured upon...</p>

  <p>Having got a list of the chief shareholders in Daphne Concessions, he set
  out to bargain for their holdings in the speediest way, by personal
  visitation. I gathered that time was of the essence of the business.</p>

  <p>First of all he flew to Berlin. There he had an interview with the
  president of one of the big air services, and, having a good deal of
  purchase, obtained certain privileges not usually granted to the travelling
  public. The said president gave a dinner for him at the Adlon, at which he
  met two people with whom he had long conversations. One was Dilling, the
  airman, one of the few German aces who had survived the War, who was now busy
  blazing the trails in commercial aviation. He was specialising at the moment
  in trans-African flights, and hoped to lower the record from Europe to Cape
  Town. Tavanger made friends with Dilling, who was a simple soul wholly
  engrossed in his profession.</p>

  <p>The other guest was Sprenger, the metallurgical chemist who had first
  discovered the industrial uses of michelite. Sprenger was an untidy little
  man of about sixty, the kind of genius who has never reaped the fruit of his
  labours and is inclined to be peevish. But he went on doggedly with these
  labours under considerable difficulties, living on certain small fees for
  patent rights and on a modest salary paid him by the not very flourishing
  Rosas-Sprenger company. Tavanger had a remarkable gift of winning people's
  confidence, and he made Sprenger talk freely, since the latter had no notion
  that his companion had any michelite interests, though he showed an
  intelligent appreciation of the metal's possibilities. Three things Tavanger
  discovered. The first was that Sprenger was ill-informed about the Daphne
  Concessions, from which it might be deduced that his company was equally in
  the dark. Therefore no immediate competition for the Daphne shares need be
  looked for from that quarter. The second was that he was desperately loyal to
  his own company, and would never be seduced into a rival concern. This solved
  one problem for Tavanger, who had been ready to pay a considerable price for
  Sprenger's services. The third was that the little chemist was toiling away
  at michelite problems, especially the major difficulty of the smelting costs,
  and was inclined to hope that he was on the brink of a great discovery. Any
  such discovery would of course belong to his company, but Tavanger
  ascertained that the Rosas-Sprenger had an agreement with the Anatilla to
  pool any devices for lessening costs. The Anatilla no doubt provided some of
  the working capital which enabled the German company to experiment.</p>

  <p>The dinner convinced Tavanger that there was no time to be lost. He flew
  to Salonika by the ordinary Middle East service, and then changed into a
  seaplane which took him to Crete. The famous antiquary, Dr Heilbron, was busy
  there with his Minoan excavations. Heilbron had some years before been
  engaged in investigating the Zimbabwe remains, and had spent a considerable
  time in Rhodesia. For some reason or other he had been induced to put money
  into Daphne Concessions at the start, and owned a block of five thousand
  shares which he had almost forgotten about.</p>

  <p>I could guess at the masterly way in which Tavanger handled Heilbron and
  got what he wanted. He appeared to be the ordinary traveller, who had dropped
  in on his way to Egypt to get a glimpse of the antiquary's marvellous work.
  Being well read, he no doubt talked intelligently on the Minoan civilisation.
  He let drop that he was a businessman with South African interests, and drew
  from Heilbron the story of his Daphne investment. The antiquary was
  comfortably off, but excavation consumes a good deal of money, and he seems
  to have jumped at Tavanger's offer to buy his shares, which he had long ago
  written off as worthless when he thought of them at all. Tavanger offered a
  good price for them, but insisted on Heilbron consulting his stockbroker. The
  answer was favourable, and the transfer was arranged by cable.</p>

  <p>While in Crete Tavanger received another cable which perturbed him. The
  big block of Daphne shares which he had acquired was not all in his own name;
  the registered holders of a third were his nominees and quite obscure people.
  This had been done with a purpose. He wanted to know if the Anatilla people
  were coming into the market; if they did, they were not likely to approach
  him in the first instance, but to go for the humbler holders. The cable told
  him that an offer had been made to one of his nominees&mdash;a handsome
  offer&mdash;and that this had been traced by his intelligence department as
  coming through two firms who were known to handle a good deal of Glaubsteins'
  European business.</p>

  <p>Tavanger had had a long experience of Glaubsteins' methods, and he was
  aware that they did not enter any market for fun. If they were buyers of
  Daphnes at all they were out for complete control, and, being people of his
  own stamp, would not let the grass grow under their feet. They had obviously
  started on the road which was to lead to a great combine. The bulk of the
  shareholders were in South Africa, and he was morally certain that at this
  moment representatives of Glaubsteins' were on steamers bound for the Cape.
  Well, it behoved him to get there before them, and that could not be done by
  returning to England and embarking in a South African boat. No more could it
  be done by the Messageries line and the East African route. A bolder course
  was required, and, faced with apparently insurmountable difficulties,
  Tavanger began to enjoy himself.</p>

  <p>He cabled to the Aero president in Berlin and to Dilling, and then set his
  face for Egypt. Here he struck a snag. There was no direct air line from
  Crete to Cairo, and if he went back to Salonika the journey would take him
  six days. But he managed to pick up a coasting steamer from the Piraeus, and
  by bribing the captain induced it to start at once. The weather grew vile,
  and the wretched boat took five days to wallow through the Eastern
  Mediterranean, while Tavanger, a bad sailor, lay deathly sick in a smelly
  cabin. He reached Cairo, pretty much of a physical wreck, only one day
  earlier than by the comfortable Salonika route.</p>

  <p>But, as it happened, that one day made all the difference, for it enabled
  him to catch Dilling before he started on his southward journey. With Dilling
  he had all sorts of trouble, for the airman, in spite of the recommendation
  of the Aero president, showed himself most unwilling to take a passenger. He
  was flying a new type of light machine, and he wanted as his companion a
  skilled mechanic. I don't know how Tavanger managed to overcome his
  reluctance; he called in some of his airmen friends at the Cairo station, and
  he got the British authorities to make an international favour of the thing,
  but I fancy the chief weapons were his uncommon persuasive power and his
  personal magnetism. Anyhow, after a hectic afternoon of argument, Dilling
  consented.</p>

  <p>Then began a wild adventure. Tavanger had never flown much, only pottered
  between Croydon and the continent, and now he found himself embarked on a
  flight across the wildest country on earth, with a pilot who was one-fourth
  scientist and three-fourths adventurer, and who did not value his own or
  anybody else's life at two pins. Tavanger admitted to me that at first his
  feet were cold. Also, Dilling on a big flight was a poor companion. His
  eagerness affected his temper, and his manners were those of a slave-driver
  and his conversation mostly insults.</p>

  <p>As long as they were in the Nile Valley things went well enough. But in
  the basin of the Great Lakes they ran into a chain of thunderstorms, and
  after that into head-winds and massive sheets of rain. The bucketing they got
  played the deuce with the light machine, and engine trouble developed. They
  had to make a forced landing in very bad forest ground on the skirts of
  Ruwenzori, where they found that something had gone wrong with the petrol
  pump and that some of the propeller and cylinder bolts had worked loose. For
  forty hours they toiled in a tropical jungle cloaked in a hot wet mist,
  Dilling cursing steadily. Tavanger said that before they had got the machine
  right he had learned a good deal about air mechanics. When they started again
  they found that they had two lizards and a snake in their fuselage!</p>

  <p>After that they had many minor troubles, and Dilling's temper had become
  so vile, owing to his disappointment at the rate of speed, that Tavanger had
  much ado to keep the peace. He himself had contracted a chill, and for the
  last ten hours of the journey had a high temperature and a blinding headache.
  When they reached Bulawayo and he crawled out of his seat he could scarcely
  stand. Dilling, having made port, became a new man. He kissed Tavanger on
  both cheeks, and wept when he said goodbye.</p>

  <p>Tavanger went to an hotel, sent for a doctor, and cured himself in two
  days. He could not afford to waste time in bed. Also he permitted himself to
  be interviewed by the local press, for his journey with Dilling, in spite of
  the delays, had been something of a feat. He told the reporters that he had
  come to South Africa for a holiday, but that he hoped, while in the country,
  to have a look round. This of course meant business, for Tavanger's was a
  famous name in the circles of high finance. He mentioned no particular line,
  but hinted at the need for the establishment in South Africa of a certain
  type of steel-making plant to meet local requirements, with a possible export
  trade to India. He had considerable steel interests in Britain, and all this
  sounded quite natural. He knew that it would be cabled home, and would be
  read by the Anatilla people, and it seemed to him the best camouflage. If
  rumours got about that he was enquiring about Daphnes, they would be
  connected with this steel scheme and not taken too seriously.</p>

  <p>He now controlled twenty-two thousand odd of the hundred thousand ordinary
  shares. There were five people in South Africa&mdash;about a dozen possibles,
  but five in particular&mdash; from whom he hoped to acquire the balance which
  would give him a controlling interest. The first was a retired railway
  engineer, who lived at Wynberg, near Cape Town. The second was a lawyer who
  had a seat in the Union Parliament, and the third was a Johannesburg
  stockbroker. The other two were a mining engineer employed at a Rhodesian
  copper mine, and a fruit farmer in the Salisbury district. Tavanger decided
  that he had better begin at Cape Town, for that was the point which the
  Anatilla emissaries would reach first, and he must not be forestalled. The
  Anatilla people were of course in possession of all the information about the
  shareholders that he had himself.</p>

  <p>So, reflecting that he was playing a game which seemed to belong to some
  crude romance of boyhood, Tavanger flew to Cape Town, and put up at the Mount
  Nelson. He had various friends in the city, but his first business was to
  study a passenger list of the incoming steamers. The tourist traffic to South
  Africa does not begin till after Christmas, so he found the lists small, and
  most of the people, with the help of the shipping clerks, he was able to
  identify. None of the passengers gave an American address, but he decided
  that the Anatilla representative was one or other of two men, Robson and
  Steinacker. Then he gave a luncheon to some of his friends, and proceeded to
  sound them cautiously about the retired railway man at Wynberg, whose name
  was Barrowman.</p>

  <p>It turned out that he was a well-known figure, a vigorous youth of sixty
  whose hobbies were botany and mountaineering. Now, Tavanger in his youth had
  been an active member of the Alpine Club&mdash;he had begun climbing as a boy
  with his Swiss relations&mdash;and he was delighted to find a ready-made
  link.</p>

  <p>It was arranged that he should meet Barrowman at dinner at the house of
  one of his friends at Muizenberg, and presently, on a superb moonlit night,
  with the long tides breaking beneath them on the white sands, he sat on the
  Muizenberg stoep next a trim little man who overflowed with pent-up
  enthusiasms. Barrowman had made a comfortable small fortune by his
  profession, and was now bent on sampling all the enjoyments which had been
  crowded out of a busy life. He was a bachelor, and had settled at Wynberg in
  order that he might be near Table Mountain, on whose chimneys and traverses
  he was the chief authority. Tavanger conjured up his early ardour, asked
  eagerly concerning the different routes and the quality of the rock, and
  gladly accepted Barrowman's offer to take him next day to the summit of the
  mountain.</p>

  <p>They spent some very hot and fatiguing hours in kloofs which were too full
  of vegetable matter for comfort, and reached the summit by a difficult and
  not over-safe chimney. Tavanger was badly out of practice and training, and
  at one point was in serious danger. However, the top was won at last, and
  Barrowman was in the best of tempers, for it pleased him to find one, who was
  some years his junior and who had done most of the legendary courses in the
  Alps, so manifestly his inferior in skill and endurance. So as they ate their
  luncheon on the dusty tableland he expanded happily.</p>

  <p>It appeared that he thought of retiring for good to England. He had
  climbed everything in South Africa worth climbing, including the buttresses
  of Mont Aux Sources, and he wanted to be nearer the classic ground of his
  hobby. Also he dreamed of an English garden where he could acclimatise much
  of the Cape flora... He would like, however, to realise some of his South
  African holdings. All his eggs were in the one basket, and, if he was going
  to settle at home, he ought to distribute them better. In England one could
  not watch South African stocks with the requisite closeness. "The trouble,"
  he said, "is that it's a rotten time to change investments. Good enough for
  the buyer, but the devil for the seller... Do you know anything about these
  things?"</p>

  <p>"A little," Tavanger answered. "You see, they're more or less my
  profession. I should be delighted to help you. If your things are sound,
  there is generally a fair market to be had, if you take a little pains to
  find it."</p>

  <p>So three hours later in the Wynberg bungalow he went with Barrowman over
  his holdings. Most were good enough&mdash;town lots in Johannesburg, Bulawayo
  and Durban, investment company debentures, one or two deep-level gold
  properties which were paying high dividends; but there was a certain amount
  of junk, mostly land development companies where Barrowman had come in on the
  ground-floor. "Oh, and there's those Daphnes," Barrowman said wryly. "God
  knows why I ever got let in for them. There was a man at Salisbury who swore
  by them, and as I was rather flush of money at the time I plunged. I meant to
  realise in a month or two, but the darned things have never paid a penny, and
  no one will look at them. I've tried to get rid of them, but I was never bid
  more than five bob."</p>

  <p>Tavanger took a lot of pains with Barrowman's list, and, since he seemed
  to possess uncanny knowledge of the markets of the world and was a
  fellow-mountaineer, Barrowman accepted all he said for gospel. He advised
  holding on to the town lots and the debentures, but taking the first
  favourable moment to sell the deep levels, the producing life of which was
  limited. As the dividends were high they would fetch a reasonable figure. As
  to the unsaleable junk, Barrowman had better hold on; you never knew how a
  dud might turn out. "I can get you a fair price for your Daphnes," he added.
  "They're not everybody's stock, but they might have their uses."</p>

  <p>"What sort of price?" Barrowman asked. "I bought them at par, you
  know."</p>

  <p>"I can get you sixteen and six," was the answer. "At least, I think I can
  ... I tell you what I'll do. This is my own line of country, and as a
  speculation I'll buy them from you at that price. Call it a small return for
  your hospitality."</p>

  <p>This was the price that Tavanger had paid in London, and Barrowman jumped
  at it. "I felt so generous," Tavanger told me, "that I took over also a block
  of shares in a thing called the Voortrekkers, a land company which owned a
  lot of Portuguese bush-veld, and had sat tight on its undeveloped holding for
  twenty years. Barrowman almost wept when I gave him my cheque for the lot. I
  really felt that I had done well by him, for, when you added the worthless
  Voortrekkers, I had paid pretty nearly par for the Daphne shares."</p>

  <p>The next step was easy. The lawyer-politician, Dove by name, Tavanger had
  already met. He was frankly hard up, for he had spoiled a good practice by
  going into Parliament, and at the same time was determined to stick to
  politics, where his chief ambition lay. He knew all about Tavanger by repute,
  and actually sought him out to consult him. Tavanger was friendly, and
  declared himself anxious to help a man who had so sound a notion of the
  future of the Empire. A directorship or two might be managed&mdash;he
  controlled various concerns with South African boards&mdash;he would look
  into the matter when he got home. He counselled Dove to give as much time as
  he could to the Bar&mdash;he would do what he could to put work in his way.
  Thus encouraged, Dove opened his heart. He wanted money, not in the future
  but now&mdash;there were payments due on certain irrigated lands which he
  owned, and he did not want to have the mortgages foreclosed. But everything
  was at such ruination prices, and if he sold any of his sound investments it
  would be at a hideous loss. Tavanger asked him what he had, and in the list
  given him was a block of Daphne shares about which Dove was blasphemous.
  Tavanger appeared to consider deeply.</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you what I'll do," he said at length. "I'll buy your Daphnes. I
  might make something of them. They're not worth half a crown to the ordinary
  operator, but they're worth more than that to me. To ME, and I believe to
  scarcely anybody else. I'll give you sixteen and sixpence for them."</p>

  <p>Dove stared and stammered. "Do you mean it? It's tremendous. But I can't
  take it, you know. It's pure charity."</p>

  <p>"Not a bit of it," said Tavanger. "I quote you sixteen and six because I
  happen to know that that was the price paid for a block in London the other
  day by a man who was very much in my position. It's a gamble, of course, but
  that's my business."</p>

  <p>As Tavanger was leaving the club, where he had been having an early lunch
  with Dove, he ran into Barrowman in the company of a lean, spectacled
  gentleman, whose particular quality of tan proclaimed that he had just landed
  from a sea voyage. Barrowman was effusive in his greetings and longings for
  another talk before Tavanger sailed. "I can't wait now," he said. "I've got
  to give a man luncheon. A fellow called Steinacker, an American who has an
  introduction to me from one of my old directors."</p>

  <p>Tavanger took the night mail to Johannesburg, feeling that he had won his
  first race by a short head.</p>

  <p>The next proposition was tougher. The Johannesburg stockbroker, Nall by
  name, to whom he had taken the precaution of being introduced by cable from
  London, received him royally, insisted on putting him up in his big house in
  the Sachsenwaid, and gave a dinner for him at the Rand Club, to which most of
  the magnates of the place were bidden. Tavanger was of course a household
  name in these circles, and there was much curiosity as to what he was doing
  in South Africa. He stuck, both in private talk and in his interviews with
  the Press, to his original story: he was there for a holiday&mdash;had long
  wanted to fly Africa from north to south&mdash;was becoming interested in
  commercial aviation&mdash;hoped to get some notion of how South Africa was
  shaping&mdash;had some idea of a new steel industry. He made a speech at the
  Rand Club dinner in which he expounded certain views on the currency
  situation throughout the globe and the importance of discovering new
  gold-fields. For three days he feasted and talked at large, never saying
  anything that mattered, but asking innumerable questions. Nall watched him
  with a quizzical smile.</p>

  <p>On the third evening, in the seclusion of the smoking-room, his host took
  off his glasses and looked at him with his shrewd eyes, a little bleared with
  the Rand dust.</p>

  <p>"Seriously, Mr Tavanger, what are you here for? That steel business story
  won't wash, you know."</p>

  <p>"Why not?" Tavanger asked.</p>

  <p>"Because you have already turned down that proposition when it was made to
  you."</p>

  <p>"May not a man have second thoughts?"</p>

  <p>"He may, but not you&mdash;not after the reasons you gave last year."</p>

  <p>Tavanger laughed. "All right. Have it your own way. Would you be surprised
  to learn that the simple explanation is true? I wanted a holiday. I wanted to
  fling my heels and get rid of London for a month or two. I was getting
  infernally stale. Are you clever enough to realise that the plain reason is
  often the right one?... But being here, I had to pretend that I had some sort
  of business purpose. It's a kind of lèse-majesté for people like me to get
  quit of the shop."</p>

  <p>"Good," said Nall. "That is what I thought myself. But being here, I take
  it you're not averse to doing a little business."</p>

  <p>"By no means. I have had my fling, and now I'm quite ready to pick up
  anything that's going. What have you to suggest? I had better say straight
  off that I don't want gold-mines. I don't understand that business, and I've
  always made it a rule never to touch them. And I don't want town lots. I
  carry enough of the darned things in the city of London."</p>

  <p>"Good," said Nall again. "Now we understand each other. I wonder what
  would interest you."</p>

  <p>That was the first of several long and intricate talks. If Tavanger
  brought up the subject of Daphnes, at once Nall would become suspicious and
  ask a fancy price&mdash;or refuse to sell at all, for there was no such
  motive as in the cases of Dove and Barrowman. His only hope was to reach the
  subject by the method of exhaustion. So Tavenger had to listen while all the
  assets of South Africa were displayed before him&mdash;ferrous and nonferrous
  metals, rubies in the Lebombo hills, electric power from the streams that
  descended the Berg, new types of irrigation, new fruits and cereals and
  fibres, a variety of fancy minerals. He professed to be interested in a new
  copper area, and in the presence of corundum in the eastern mountains. Then
  Nall mentioned michelite. In a level voice Tavanger asked about it, and was
  given a glowing account of the possibilities of the Daphne Concessions.</p>

  <p>"That subject rather interests me," Tavanger said, "for I know a German
  chemist, Sprenger, who is the chief authority on it. They're up against every
  kind of snag, which they won't get over in our time, but it might be the kind
  of thing to buy and lock away for one's grandchildren."</p>

  <p>Nall demurred. On the contrary, michelite was on the edge of a mighty
  boom, and in a year Daphnes would be soaring. When Tavanger shook his head,
  he repeated his view, and added, by way of confirmation, that he held twenty
  thousand Daphnes which he meant at all costs to stick to.</p>

  <p>"I have some michelite shares, I think," said Tavanger, after an apparent
  effort of reminiscence, "and like you, I shall stick to them. Indeed, I
  wouldn't mind getting a few more. My children will curse me, but my
  grandchildren may bless me."</p>

  <p>Again and again they went over the list, and Tavanger gave the impression
  that he was seriously interested in corundum, moderately in copper, and very
  mildly in michelite, though he thought the last not practical business at the
  moment. He adopted the pose of a man who had no desire for anything more, but
  might take a few oddments if his capricious appetite were tempted. Presently
  he discovered that Nall was very keen about the corundum affair, and was
  finding it difficult to get together the requisite working capital. Tavanger
  poured all the cold water he could on the scheme, but Nall's faith was proof
  against it.</p>

  <p>"I want you to help, Mr Tavanger. I want your money, but still more I want
  your name."</p>

  <p>Tavanger yawned. "You've been uncommonly kind to me," he said, "and I'd
  like to give you a hand. Also I rather fancy picking up some little thing
  wherever I go, just as a tripper buys souvenirs. But your Lebombo business is
  quite outside my beat."</p>

  <p>"Is that final?" Nall asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes... Well, no&mdash;I'll tell you what I'll do. You want ready money,
  and I have a little in hand. I'll put up ten thousand for the Lebombo, and
  I'll buy your Daphne shares. There's no market for them at present, you tell
  me. Well, I'll make you a fair offer. I'll give you sixteen and six, which
  was about the best price last year for Anatillas."</p>

  <p>Nall wrinkled his brow.</p>

  <p>"Why do you want them?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Because they are in my line, which corundum isn't. I have already some
  michelite shares, as I told you, and I believe it's a good investment for my
  family."</p>

  <p>"I would rather not sell."</p>

  <p>"Then the whole deal is off. Believe me, my dear fellow, I shall be quite
  happy to go home without putting a penny into South Africa. I came out here
  literally for my health."</p>

  <p>Then Nall tried to screw up the price for Daphnes, but there he met with
  such a final negative that he relinquished the attempt. The result was that
  two days later Tavanger took the train for Delagoa Bay, with ten thousand
  more Daphnes to his credit and a liability for ten thousand pounds, his share
  in the underwriting of the coming flotation of the Lebombo Corundum
  Corporation.</p>

  <p>From Lourenço Marquez he sailed to Beira, and ascended to the Rhodesian
  plateau. There he stepped off the plank into deepish waters. The two
  remaining holders of Daphnes lived in the country north of Salisbury, both a
  long distance from railhead, but fairly near each other. Tavanger decided to
  take Devenish first, who had a fruit farm in the hills about forty miles from
  a station. He was a little puffed up by his successes, and anticipated no
  difficulties; he did not trouble to enquire about Devenish or the other man,
  Greenlees, or to get introductions to them; he was inclined now to trust to
  his unaided powers of persuasion, and meant to drop in on them as a
  distinguished stranger touring the country.</p>

  <p>It was early summer in those parts, when rain might be looked for, but so
  far the weather had been dry. The roads were in good order and Tavanger hired
  a car in Salisbury in which he proposed to make the trip. But he had not gone
  twenty miles before the heavens opened. The country had been smoking with
  bush-fires, but these were instantly put out by a torrential deluge. The
  roads had never been properly engineered and had no real bottom, and in an
  hour or two the hard red grit had been turned into a foot or two of gummy red
  mud, while the shallow fords had swollen to lagoons. With immense difficulty
  the car reached the dorp on the railway line, which was the nearest point to
  Devenish's farm. Tavanger put up at the wretched hotel, and made enquiries.
  He got hold of an old transport driver called Potgieter, who told him that
  the car was as useless as a perambulator. His only chance of getting to
  Devenish next day was by cape-cart and a span of mules, and that, unless the
  rain stopped, was not very rosy.</p>

  <p>Tavanger left the car and the driver in the dorp, and started next morning
  with Potgieter in the same relentless deluge. The transport-rider was an old
  hand at the game, but even he confessed that he had never travelled in worse
  conditions. The road was mostly impossible, so they took to the open veld
  among ant-heaps and meerkat holes which threatened to wrench the wheels off.
  The worst trouble was with the streams that came down from the hills on their
  left, each a tawny torrent. Also they struck many patches of marsh, which
  they had to circumnavigate, and in one vlei they spent an hour getting the
  wheels of the cart out of the mire. The mist hung close about them, and if
  Potgieter had not known the road like his own hand, they would have been
  wandering in circles. At a native village half-way, they heard that a bigger
  stream in front was impassable, but they managed to cross with the mules
  swimming, while Potgieter performed miracles with his long whip. But the end
  came when they were still five miles from their destination. The cape-cart
  smashed its axle in an extra deep mud-hole, and the rest of the journey was
  performed on foot, with Potgieter driving the mules before him. Soaked to the
  bone and mud to the eyes, Tavanger presented himself at Devenish's little
  farm. Instead of arriving in a lordly way in a touring car, he appeared out
  of the mist, a very weary, hungry, and dishevelled tramp.</p>

  <p>As it turned out it was the best thing that could have happened. Devenish
  was a simple, hospitable soul with a taste for letters, who had lately taken
  to himself a like-minded wife. He was profoundly suspicious of the dwellers
  in cities, especially the financial folk who played tricks with the market
  for his fruit and tobacco. He had inherited his Daphne holding from an uncle,
  and had personally never bought or sold a share in his life. Had Tavanger
  arrived in a smart car with the air of a moneyed man of affairs, Devenish
  would have looked on him with deep distrust. But this muddy and famished
  stranger, who was obviously an educated man, he took to his heart, prepared a
  hot bath for him, lent him dry clothes, and fed him handsomely on broiled
  chicken, green mealies and Afrikander sausages.</p>

  <p>That night, while Potgieter puffed his deep-bowled pipe and dozed,
  Tavanger and Devenish talked of books and home. As luck would have it Mrs
  Devenish came from that part of Norfolk where Tavanger for a long time had
  had a shoot, and they were able to identify common friends. The fruit-farmer
  was very much in love with his job, but both he and his wife were a little
  starved of conversation with their own kind, and the evening was a great
  occasion for them. Mrs Devenish played Schubert on the cottage piano, and
  they all went to bed very good friends. Not a word had been spoken of
  business, for Tavanger had sized up his host and realised that he must
  proceed cautiously.</p>

  <p>But the thing proved to be simplicity itself. Next morning came one of
  those breaks in the rain, when a hot sun shone on a steaming earth. Devenish
  conducted his guest round his property&mdash;the orchards of peach and
  apricot and naartje, the tobacco lands, the dam shining like a turquoise amid
  the pale emerald of the alfalfa fields. He told him the tale of his successes
  and his difficulties; even with the bad prices of tobacco he was covering
  costs (he had some private income to live on), but he badly needed more
  capital for development. He wanted to make a second dam and lay out a new
  orchard for a special kind of plum, but he was determined not to mortgage his
  farm. Where was the money to come from? Tavanger enquired tactfully about his
  possessions, and heard about the seven thousand Daphne shares which he had
  inherited. Devenish had already made some attempt to sell these, for he had
  no views on the subject of michelite, but had found them unsaleable except at
  a price which he regarded as a swindle. He was such an innocent that he
  believed that if a share was nominally worth a pound any man who offered him
  less was trying to cheat him... The upshot was that Tavanger bought the seven
  thousand Daphnes, but had to buy them at par. He realised that he might argue
  till Doomsday before he got Devenish to understand the position, and that any
  attempt at bargaining would awake suspicions in his host. He had never met a
  man so compounded of caution and ignorance.</p>

  <p>Devenish had a blacksmith's shop on his farm, and his overseer was a good
  mechanic, so the cape-cart was fetched from the mud-hole and given a new
  axle. The rain kept off that day, but the next morning when they started for
  Greenlees' mine it began again in grim earnest. They had about fifty miles to
  go through a wild bit of country, which did not contain even a native
  village, and the road was at its best only a scar on the veld, and, when it
  ran through bush, scarcely wider than a foot-track. Devenish insisted on
  providing them with plenty of food, which was fortunate, for they took three
  days to reach Greenlees...</p>

  <p>This was the best part of Tavanger's story, but I must confine myself to
  the bare outline. They struck a river at what was usually a broad shallow
  ford, but was now a lake of yeasty water. It was the only possible place, for
  above and below the stream ran a defile among rocks, and the whole outfit was
  nearly drowned before they made the crossing. But they found themselves on an
  island, for another branch of the river, broader, deeper and swifter,
  confronted them a hundred yards farther on. This proved hopeless, and
  Potgieter tried to recross the first branch, with the notion of making a
  circuit and finding an easier ford farther up. But the water was rising every
  minute, and even the transport-rider's stout heart failed him. He announced
  that there was nothing to be done except to wait for the river to fall.
  Happily the island was high ground, so there was no risk of its being
  overflowed.</p>

  <p>They spent two nights and a day in that dismal place, which in twelve
  hours had shrunk to the limits of about a couple of acres. It was covered
  with low scrub, but this was no shelter from the unceasing rain. Potgieter
  made a scherm for the mules out of wait-a-bit thorns, and inside it rigged up
  a sort of tent with the cover of the cape-cart. It was as well that he did
  this, for the two men were not the only refugees on the island. Various kinds
  of buck had been cut off by the flood, and bush-pig, and the mules were in a
  perpetual ferment, which Potgieter said was due to lions. Tavanger more than
  once thought he saw a tawny, slinking shadow in the undergrowth. They got a
  sort of fire going, but there was no decent fuel to burn, and the best they
  could do was a heap of smoking twigs. Potgieter shot a brace of guinea-fowl,
  which they cooked for dinner in the scanty ashes. He would not let Tavanger
  stir from the scherm, for he said that the island would be full of
  storm-stayed snakes and other unhallowed oddments. So the wretched pair had
  to twiddle their thumbs for thirty-six hours in an atmosphere like a Turkish
  bath, coughing and choking by the greenwood fire, and subsisting for the most
  part on Devenish's cold viands. Unluckily they had neither tea nor coffee,
  and their tobacco ran out. Tavanger got a furious cold in his head and
  rheumatic pains in his back, but the worst discomfort was the utter boredom;
  for Potgieter had no small talk, and slept most of the time.</p>

  <p>Late on the second night the rain ceased, and revealed a wonderful sky of
  stars. On the second morning the river had fallen sufficiently to be forded,
  and mules and men, very stiff and miserable, started off for Greenlees. But
  their troubles were not over, for the valley they presently struck seemed to
  have melted into primeval slime, and when they got on to the higher ground
  they had to make lengthy detours to circumvent landslips. It was almost dark
  when they reached the mine, and it took Greenlees some time, Tavanger said,
  to realise that they were human. When he did, when he understood who Tavanger
  was&mdash; having spent some time in a London office he knew him by
  repute&mdash;and recognised Potgieter as a man with whom he had once hunted,
  he was hospitable enough. In an empty rondavel he filled two wooden tubs with
  scalding water, into which he put a tin of mustard and a can of sheep-deep,
  declaring that it was the only way to stave off pneumonia.</p>

  <p>Greenlees proved the simplest of the five to deal with, for he was an
  enthusiast about michelite. He was a Scotsman from Berwickshire, who had had
  a sound university training and knew a good deal about metallurgical
  chemistry as well as about engineering. He had been employed at the Daphne
  mine when it first began, and had believed so firmly in its prospects that he
  had scraped up every penny he could muster at the time and bought a biggish
  holding. Then he had quarrelled with the manager, but his faith in the
  concern had not wavered. He declared that it was abominably managed, that the
  costs were far too high, and the marketing arrangements rudimentary, but
  nevertheless, he was convinced that before long it would be one of the most
  lucrative concerns in the country. He anticipated, for one thing, some
  discovery which would bring down the smelting costs. "I'll hold on," he said,
  "though I should have to go wanting the breeks to do it."</p>

  <p>Tavanger, seeing the sort of man he had to deal with, put his cards on the
  table. He told Greenlees frankly that he meant to control Daphne. He
  described, as only Tavanger could describe, the manoeuvres by which he had
  acquired the big London block, his journey to South Africa ("God, but you're
  the determined one," said Greenlees), his doings at the Cape and in
  Johannesburg, and his wild trek in the Rhodesian rains.</p>

  <p>"I want to buy your holding, Mr Greenlees," he concluded. "I will pay any
  price you fix, and will contract to sell you the shares back on demand any
  time after next June at the price I gave for them. What I want is control of
  the stock till then, and for the privilege I am ready to pay you a bonus of
  one thousand pounds."</p>

  <p>Of course Greenlees consented, for he saw that Tavanger was a believer
  like himself, and so far he had not met another. He asked various questions.
  Tavanger said nothing about the coming combine, but let him think that his
  views were the same as his own, a belief that presently a scientific
  discovery would make michelite a commodity of universal use. He mentioned
  having talked with Sprenger in Berlin, and Greenlees nodded respectfully.</p>

  <p>They sat late into the night discussing the future. Greenlees explained
  the system at work at the Daphne mine, and how it could be bettered, and
  Tavanger then and there offered him the managership. It was a London company,
  and its annual shareholders' meeting fell in January; Tavanger proposed
  drastically to reconstruct both the English and South African boards and to
  reform the management.</p>

  <p>"What about having a look at the place?" Greenlees asked. "You could
  easily look in on your way down country."</p>

  <p>Tavanger shook his head. "I'm not a technical expert," he said, "and I
  would learn very little. I've always made it a rule never to mix myself up
  with things I don't understand. But I reckon myself a fair judge of men, and
  I shall be content to trust you."</p>

  <p>As they went to bed Greenlees showed him a telegram. "Did you ever hear of
  this fellow? Steinacker or Stemacker his name is. He wants to see
  me&mdash;has an introduction from the chairman of my company. I wired to him
  to come along, and he is turning up the day after tomorrow."</p>

  <p>This was the story which Tavanger told me that night in my rooms. His
  adventures seemed to have renewed his youth, for he looked actually boyish,
  and I understood that half the power of the man&mdash;and indeed of anyone
  who succeeds in his line&mdash;lay just in a boyish readiness to fling his
  cap on the right occasion over the moon.</p>

  <p>"I deserve to win out, don't you think?" he said, "for I've risked my neck
  by air, land and water&mdash;not to mention black mambas... I should like to
  have seen Steinacker's face when he had finished gleaning in my tracks... The
  next thing is to get to grips with Glaubsteins. Oh yes, I'll keep you
  informed. You're the only man I can talk to frankly about this business, and
  half the fun of an adventure is to be able to gossip about it."</p><br>

  <h3>III</h3>

  <p>I saw nothing of Tavanger again till the end of February, when he appeared
  as a witness for the defence in a case in which I led for the plaintiff, and
  I had the dubious pleasure of cross-examining him. I say "dubious," for he
  was one of the most formidable witnesses I have ever met, candid, accurate,
  self-possessed and unshakable. Two days later I had to make a speech&mdash;an
  old promise to him&mdash;at the annual meeting, in the hall of the Fletchers'
  Company, of the children's hospital of which he was chairman. There I saw a
  new Tavanger, one who spoke of the hospital and its work as a man speaks of
  his family in a moment of expansion, who had every detail at his fingers' end
  and who descanted on its future with a sober passion. I was amazed, till I
  remembered that this was one of his two hobbies. He was Master of the
  Company, so he gave me tea afterwards in his private room, and expanded on
  the new dental clinic which he said was the next step in the hospital's
  progress.</p>

  <p>"I mean to present the clinic," he told me, "if things turn out well. That
  is why I'm so keen about this Daphne business... "</p>

  <p>He stopped and smiled at me.</p>

  <p>"I know that I'm reputed to be very well off, and I can see that you're
  wondering why I don't present it in any case, since presumably I can afford
  it. Perhaps I can, but that has never been my way. I have for years kept a
  separate account which I call my 'gambling fund,' and into it goes whatever
  comes to me by the grace of God outside the main line of my business. I draw
  on that account for my hobbies&mdash;my pictures and my hospital. Whatever I
  make out of Daphnes will go there, and if my luck is in I may be able to make
  the hospital the best-equipped thing of its kind on the globe. That way, you
  see, I get a kind of sporting interest in the game.</p>

  <p>"Oh, we have brisked up Daphnes a bit," he said in reply to my question.
  "I'm chairman now&mdash;my predecessor was an elderly titled nonentity who
  was easily induced to retire. We had our annual meeting last month, and the
  two vacancies on the directorate which occurred by rotation were filled by my
  own men. We've cleaned up the South African board too. Greenlees is now
  chairman, as well as general manager of the mine. He has already reduced the
  costs of mining the stuff, and we're getting a bigger share of the British
  import... No, there's been no reduction of price, though that may come. We
  stick to the same price as the other companies. There is a modest market for
  our shares, too, when they're offered, which isn't often. The price is about
  fifteen shillings, pretty much the same as Anatillas.</p>

  <p>"I own fifty-two thousand shares out of the hundred thousand ordinaries,"
  he went on, "just enough to give me control with a small margin. They have
  cost me the best part of seventy thousand pounds, but I consider them a good
  bargain. For Glaubsteins have opened the ball. They're determined to get
  Daphne into their pool, and I am quite willing to oblige them&mdash;at my own
  price." Tavanger's smile told me the kind of price that would be.</p>

  <p>"Oh yes, they're nibbling hard. I hear that Steinacker managed to pick up
  about ten thousand shares in South Africa, and now they are stuck fast. They
  must come to me, and they've started a voluptuous curve in my direction. You
  know the way people like Glaubsteins work. The man who approaches you may be
  a simple fellow who never heard of them. They like to have layers of agents
  between themselves and the man they're after. Well, I've had offers for my
  Daphnes through one of my banks, and through two insurance companies, and
  through"&mdash;he mentioned the name of a solid and rather chauvinistic
  British financial house which was supposed to lay a rigid embargo on anything
  speculative. His intelligence department, he said, was pretty good, and the
  connection had been traced.</p>

  <p>"They've offered me par," he continued. "The dear innocents! The fact is,
  they can't get on without me, and they know it, but at present they are only
  manoeuvring for position. When we get down to real business, we'll talk a
  different language."</p>

  <p>As I have said, I had guessed that Tavanger was working on a piece of
  knowledge which he had got at Flambard, and I argued that this could only be
  a world-wide merger of michelite interests. He knew this for a fact, and was
  therefore gambling on what he believed to be a certainty. Consequently he
  could afford to wait. I am a novice in such matters, but it seemed to me that
  the only possible snag was Sprenger. Sprenger was a man of genius, and though
  he was loyal to the German company, I had understood from Tavanger that there
  was a working arrangement between that company and the Anatilla. At any
  moment he might make some discovery which would alter the whole industrial
  status of michelite, and no part of the benefit of such a discovery would go
  to the Daphne Concessions. I mentioned my doubt.</p>

  <p>"I realise that," said Tavanger, "and I am keeping Sprenger under
  observation. Easy enough to manage, for I have many lines down in Berlin. My
  information is that for the moment he has come to a halt. Indeed, he has had
  a breakdown, and has been sent off for a couple of months to some high place
  in the Alps. Also Anatilla and Rosas are not on the friendliest terms at
  present. Glaubsteins have been trying to buy out the Germans, and since they
  have lent them money, I fancy the method of procedure was rather arbitrary.
  They'll get them in the end, of course, but just now relations are rather
  strained, and it will take a fair amount of time to ease them."</p>

  <p>The word "time" impressed me. Clearly Tavanger believed that he had a free
  field up to the tenth of June&mdash;after which nothing mattered.</p>

  <p>"I'm a babe in finance," I said. "But wouldn't it be wise to screw up
  Anatilla to a good offer as soon as possible, and close with it. It's an
  uncertain world, and you never know what trick fortune may play you."</p>

  <p>He smiled. "You're a cautious lawyer, and I'm a bit of an adventurer. I
  mean to play this game with the stakes high. The way I look at it is this.
  Glaubsteins have unlimited resources, and they believe firmly in the future
  of michelite. So for that matter do I. They want to have control of the world
  output against the day when the boom comes. They can't do without me, for I
  own what is practically the largest supply and certainly the best quality.
  Very well, they must treat."</p>

  <p>"Yes, but they may spin out the negotiations if you open your mouth too
  wide. There is no reason why they should be in a hurry. And meantime
  something may happen to lower the value of your property. You never
  know."</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No. I am convinced they will bring things to a head by midsummer."</p>

  <p>He looked curiously at something which he saw in my face. In that moment
  he realised, I think, that I had divined his share in that morning session at
  Flambard.</p><br>

  <h3>IV</h3>

  <p>A few weeks later I happened to run across a member of the firm of
  stockbrokers who did my modest business.</p>

  <p>"You were asking about michelite in the autumn," he said. "There's a
  certain liveliness in the market just now. There has been a number of
  dealings in Daphnes&mdash;you mentioned them, I think&mdash;at rather a fancy
  price&mdash;round about eighteen shillings. I don't recommend them, but if
  you want something to put away you might do worse than buy Anatillas. For
  some reason or other their price has come down to twelve shillings. In my
  opinion you would be perfectly safe with them. Glaubsteins are behind them,
  you know, and Glaubsteins don't make mistakes. It would be a lock-up
  investment, but certain to appreciate."</p>

  <p>I thanked him, but told him that I was not looking for any new
  investments.</p>

  <p>That very night I met Tavanger at dinner and, since the weather was dry
  and fine, we walked part of the way home together. I asked him what he had
  been doing to depress Anatillas.</p>

  <p>"We've cut prices," he replied. "We could afford to do so, for our costs
  of getting michelite out of the ground have always been twenty-five per cent
  lower than the other companies'. We practically quarry the stuff, and the ore
  is in a purer state. Under Greenlees' management the margin is still greater,
  so we could afford a bold stroke. So far the result has been good. We have
  extended our market, and though we are making a smaller profit per ton, it
  has increased the quantity sold by about twenty per cent. But that, of
  course, wasn't my real object. I wanted to frighten Anatilla and make them
  more anxious to deal. I fancy I've rattled them a bit, for, as you seem to
  have observed, the price of their ordinaries has had a nasty jolt."</p>

  <p>"Couldn't you force them down farther?" I suggested. "When you get them
  low enough you might be able to buy Anatilla and make the merger
  yourself."</p>

  <p>"Not for worlds!" he said. "You don't appreciate the difference between
  the financier and the industrialist. Supposing I engineered the merger. I
  should be left with it on my hands till I could sell it to somebody else. I'm
  not the man who makes things, but the man who provides the money for other
  people to make them with. Besides, Glaubsteins would never sell&mdash;not on
  your life. They've simply got to control a stuff with the possibilities of
  michelite. With their enormous mineral and metal interests, and all their
  commercial subsidiaries, they couldn't afford to let it get out of their
  hands. They're immensely rich, and could put down a thousand pounds for every
  hundred that any group I got together could produce. Believe me, they'll hang
  on to michelite till their last gasp. And rightly&mdash;because they are
  users. They have a policy for dealing with it. I'm only a pirate who sails in
  and demands ransom because they've become a little negligent on the
  voyage."</p>

  <p>I asked how the negotiations were proceeding.</p>

  <p>"According to plan. We've got rid of some of the agency layers, and have
  now arrived at one remove from the principals. My last step, as I have said,
  woke them up. Javerts have now taken a hand in it, and Javerts, as you may or
  may not know, do most of the English business for Glaubsteins. They are
  obviously anxious to bring things to a head pretty soon, for they have bid me
  sixty shillings a share."</p>

  <p>"Take it, man," I said. "It will give you more than a hundred per cent
  profit."</p>

  <p>"Not enough. Besides, I want to get alongside Glaubsteins themselves. No
  intermediaries for me. That's bound to happen too. When you see in the press
  that Mr Bronson Jane has arrived in Europe, then you may know that we're
  entering on the last lap."</p>

  <p>We parted at Hyde Park Corner, and I watched him set off westward with his
  shoulders squared and his step as light as a boy's. This Daphne adventure was
  assuredly renewing Tavanger's youth.</p>

  <p>Some time in May I read in my morning paper the announcement of Sprenger's
  death. The Times had an obituary which mentioned michelite as only one of his
  discoveries. It said that no chemist had made greater practical contributions
  to industry in our time, but most of the article was devoted to his purely
  scientific work, in which it appeared that he had been among the first minds
  in Europe. This was during the General Election, when I had no time for more
  than a hasty thought as to how this news would affect Daphne.</p>

  <p>When it was all over and I was back in London, I had a note from Tavanger
  asking me to dinner. We dined alone in his big house in Kensington Palace
  Gardens, where he kept his picture collection. I remembered that I could not
  take my eyes off a superb Vermeer which hung over the dining-room
  mantelpiece. I was in that condition of bodily and mental depression which an
  election always induces in me, and I was inclined to resent Tavanger's
  abounding vitality. For he was in the best of spirits, with just a touch of
  that shamefacedness with which a man, who has been holidaying extravagantly,
  regards one who has had his nose to the grindstone. He showed no desire to
  exhibit his treasures; he wanted to talk about michelite.</p>

  <p>Sprenger was dead&mdash;a tragedy for the world of science, but a
  fortunate event for Daphne. No longer need a bombshell be feared from that
  quarter. He seemed to have left no records behind him which might contain the
  germ of a possible discovery; indeed, for some months he had been a sick and
  broken man.</p>

  <p>"It's a brutal world," said Tavanger, "when I can regard with equanimity
  the disappearance of a great man who never did me any harm. But there it is.
  Sprenger was the danger-point for me, and he was Anatilla's trump card. His
  death brought Bronson Jane across the Atlantic by the first boat. His arrival
  was in the papers, but I dare say you haven't been reading them very
  closely."</p>

  <p>It appeared that Jane had gone straight to Berlin, and, owing to the
  confusion caused by Sprenger's death, had succeeded in acquiring the control
  of Rosas for Anatilla. That was the one advantage he could get out of the
  catastrophe. It was a necessary step towards the ultimate combine, but in
  practice it would not greatly help Anatilla, for Daphne remained the
  keystone. Two days ago Jane had arrived in England, and Tavanger had seen
  him.</p>

  <p>"You have never met Bronson Jane?" he asked. "But you must know all about
  him. He is the new thing in American big business, and you won't find a more
  impressive type on the globe... Reasonably young&mdash;not much more than
  forty&mdash;rather good-looking and with charming manners... A scratch
  golfer, and quite a considerable performer at polo, I believe... The kind of
  education behind him which makes us all feel ignoramuses&mdash; good degree
  at college, the Harvard Law School, then a most comprehensive business
  training in America and Europe... The sort of man who is considered equally
  eligible for the presidency of a college, the charge of a department of
  State, or the control of a world-wide business corporation. We don't breed
  anything quite like it on this side. He is over here for Glaubsteins,
  primarily, but he had to dash off to Geneva to make a speech on some currency
  question, and next week he is due in Paris for a conference about German
  reparations. Tomorrow I believe he is dining with Geraldine and the
  politicians. He dined here last night alone with me, and knew rather more
  about my pictures than I knew myself, though books are his own particular
  hobby. A most impressive human being, I assure you. Agreeable too, the kind
  of man you'd like to go fishing with."</p>

  <p>"Is the deal through?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Not quite. He was very frank. He said that Glaubsteins wanted Daphne
  because they could use it, whereas it was no manner of good to me. I was
  equally frank, and assented. Then he said that if I held out I would be
  encumbered with a thing I could not develop&mdash;never could develop,
  whereas Glaubsteins could bring it at once into their great industrial pool
  and be working day and night on its problems. All the more need for that
  since Sprenger was dead. Again I assented. He said that he believed firmly in
  michelite, and I said that so did I. Finally, he asked if I wanted anything
  more than to turn the thing over at a handsome profit. I said I wanted
  nothing more, only the profit must be handsome.</p>

  <p>"So we started bargaining," Tavanger continued, "and I ran him up to
  eighty shillings. There he stuck his toes into the ground, and not an inch
  could I induce him to budge. I assume that that figure was the limit of his
  instructions, and that he'd have to cable for fresh ones. He'll get them, I
  have no doubt. We've to meet again when he comes back from Paris."</p>

  <p>"It seems to me an enormous price," I said. "In a few months you've forced
  the shares up from under par to four pounds. If it was my show I should be
  content with that."</p>

  <p>"I want five pounds!" he said firmly. "That is the figure I fixed in my
  mind when I first took up the business, and I mean to have it."</p>

  <p>He saw a doubt in my eye and went on. "I'm not asking anything
  unreasonable. Anatilla must have their merger, and in a year or two Daphnes
  will be worth more than five pounds to them&mdash; not to everybody, but to
  them. My terms are moderation itself compared with what Brock asked and got
  for his tin-pot railway in the Central Pacific merger, or Assher for his
  rotten newspaper. I'm giving solid value for the money. You should see
  Greenlees' reports. He says there is enough michelite in prospect to supply
  every steel plant on earth for a century."</p>

  <p>We smoked afterwards in the library, and I noticed a sheaf of plans on the
  table. Tavanger's eye followed mine.</p>

  <p>"Yes, that's the lay-out for the new clinic. We mean to start building in
  the autumn."</p><br>

  <h3>V</h3>

  <p>I was in my chambers, dictating an opinion, when my clerk brought me
  Tavanger's card. I had seen or heard nothing of him since that dinner at his
  house, and the financial columns of the press had been silent about
  michelite. All I had noticed was a slight rise in Anatilla shares owing to
  the acquisition of Rosas, the news of which had been officially published in
  America. Bronson Jane seemed to be still in England, judging from the press,
  and he had been pointed out to me on the other side of the table at a City
  dinner. It was a fine June evening, and I was just about to stretch my legs
  by strolling down to the House.</p>

  <p>"The weather tempted me to walk home," said Tavanger, when I had dismissed
  my clerk and settled him in my only armchair, "and it suddenly occurred to me
  that I might catch you here. Can you give me ten minutes? I've a lot to tell
  you."</p>

  <p>"It's all over? You've won, of course," I said. His air was so cheerful
  that it must mean victory.</p>

  <p>He laughed&mdash;not ironically, or ruefully, but with robust enjoyment.
  Tavanger had certainly acquired a pleasant boyishness from this
  enterprise.</p>

  <p>"On the contrary," he said, "I have found my Waterloo. I have abdicated
  and am in full retreat."</p>

  <p>I could only stare.</p>

  <p>"What on earth went wrong?" I stammered. "Who was your Wellington?"</p>

  <p>"My Wellington?" he repeated. "Yes, that's the right question to ask. I
  struck a Wellington who was not my match perhaps, but he had the big
  battalions behind him. It wasn't Bronson Jane. I had him in a cleft stick. It
  was a lad who was raised, I believe, in a Montana shack."</p>

  <p>Then he told me the story. Sprenger had been under agreement with Anatilla
  to communicate to them from time to time the data on which he was busy. To
  these Glaubsteins had turned on their own research department, and they had
  put in charge of it a very brilliant young metallurgical chemist called
  Untermeyer. He had been working on michelite for the better part of two
  years, chiefly the problems of a simpler and more economical method of
  smelting. Well, as luck would have it, he stumbled on the missing link in the
  process which poor Sprenger had been searching for&mdash;had an inkling of
  it, said Tavanger with awe in his tone, just after Sprenger's death, and
  proved it beyond a peradventure on the very night when Bronson Jane had dined
  in Kensington Palace Gardens. Jane's cable for permission to make a higher
  bid for the Daphne shares was answered by a message which put a very
  different complexion on the business.</p>

  <p>Glaubsteins had lost no time. They had cabled to take out provisional
  patents in every country in the world, and they had opened up negotiations
  with the chief American steel interests. There could be no doubt about the
  success of the new process. Even in its present form it brought down smelting
  costs by half, and it was doubtless capable of improvement. Michelite,
  instead of being a commodity with a restricted market, would soon have a
  world-wide use, and those who controlled michelite would reap a rich
  harvest.</p>

  <p>Michelite PLUS the new patented process. That was the whole point. The
  process had been thoroughly proven, and Tavanger said that there was no doubt
  that it could be fully protected by patents. The steel firms would work under
  a licence from Glaubsteins, and one of the terms of such a licence would be
  that they took their michelite from Anatilla. The steel industry on one side
  became practically a tied-house for Glaubsteins, and Daphne was left in the
  cold.</p>

  <p>"It's a complete knock-out," said Tavanger. "Our lower mining costs and
  our purer quality, which enabled us to cut the price, don't signify at all.
  They are all washed out by the huge reduction in smelting costs under the new
  process. Nobody's going to buy an ounce of our stuff any more. It's quite
  true that if michelite gets into general use Glaubsteins will want our
  properties. But they can afford to wait and starve us out. They have enough
  to go on with in the Anatilla and Rosas mines. There never was a prettier
  calling of a man's bluff."</p>

  <p>I asked what he had done.</p>

  <p>"Chucked in my hand. It was the only course. Bronson Jane was quite decent
  about it. He gave me par for my Daphne shares, which was far better than I
  could have hoped. Also, he agreed to my condition about keeping on Greenlees
  in the management. I am only about twenty thousand pounds to the bad, and
  I've had a lot of sport for my money. Funny to think that three weeks ago I
  could have got out of Daphne with a cool profit of one hundred and forty
  thousand."</p>

  <p>"I am sorry about the clinic," I said.</p>

  <p>"You needn't be," was the answer. "I mean to present it just the same.
  This very afternoon I approved the final plans. It will be provided for out
  of my 'gambling fund,' according to my practice. I shall sell my Vermeer to
  pay for it... It's a clinic for looking after children's teeth, but in the
  circumstances it would have been more appropriate if it had been for looking
  after their eyes. The gift is a sacrifice to the gods in token of my own
  blindness."</p>

  <p>Tavanger had suddenly become serious.</p>

  <p>"I think you guessed all along that I saw something that morning at
  Flambard. Well, I did, and I believed in it. I saw the announcement of the
  world-merger arranged by Anatilla. That is to say, I knew with perfect
  certainty that one thing was going to happen. If I hadn't known it, if I had
  gone in for Daphnes as an ordinary speculation, I would have been content to
  take my profit at two or three or four pounds. As it is, that infernal atom
  of accurate knowledge has cost me twenty thousand.</p>

  <p>"But it was worth it," he added, getting up and reaching for his hat, "for
  I have learned one thing which I shall never forget, and which I commend to
  your notice. Our ignorance of the future has been wisely ordained of Heaven.
  For unless man were to be like God and know everything, it is better that he
  should know nothing. If he knows one fact only, instead of profiting by it he
  will assuredly land in the soup."</p>

     id="chap3">III. &mdash; THE RT. HON. DAVID MAYOT</a></h2>

  <p class="poem">"I once did see<br>
  In my young travels through Armenia,<br>
  An angrie Unicorne in his full carier<br>
  Charge with too swift a foot a Jeweller,<br>
  That watcht him for the Treasure of his browe;<br>

  <br>
  &mdash;George Chapman, Bussy D'Ambois.</p>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p>I must make it clear at the outset that I was not in Mayot's confidence
  during the year the events of which I am about to record. Goodeve and Reggie
  Daker confided in me, and, through a series of accidents, I stumbled into
  Tavanger's inner life. Also I came to have full knowledge of Charles Ottery's
  case. But I only knew Mayot slightly, and we were opponents in the House, so,
  although our experiences at Flambard brought us a little nearer, we were far
  from anything like intimacy. But I realised that, under Moe's spell, he had
  seen something which had affected him deeply, and I studied closely his
  political moves to see if I could get a clue to that something. As a matter
  of fact, before Christmas I guessed what the revelation had been, and my
  guess proved correct. Later, when the whirligig of politics had brought Mayot
  and myself into closer touch, I learned from him some of the details which I
  now set forth.</p>

  <p>First of all let me state exactly what he saw. For a second of time he had
  a glimpse of the first Times leader a year ahead; his eyes fell somewhere
  about the middle of it. The leader dealt with India, and a speech of the
  Prime Minister on the subject. By way of variation the writer used the Prime
  Minister's name in one sentence, and the name was Waldemar. Now, the Labour
  Party was then in office under Sir Derrick Trant, and Mr Waldemar was the
  leader of the small, compact, and highly efficient Liberal group. Within a
  year's time, therefore, a remarkable adjustment of parties would take place,
  and the head of what was then by far the smallest party would be called upon
  to form a Government.</p>

  <p>This for a man like Mayot was tremendous news&mdash;how tremendous will
  appear from a short recital of the chief features in his character. He was
  that rare thing in the class to which he belonged, a professional politician.
  A trade-union secretary looks to a seat in Parliament as a kind of old-age
  pension, and the ranks of Labour are for the most part professional. But
  nowadays the type is uncommon&mdash;except in the case of a few famous
  families&mdash;among the middle and upper classes. Mayot would have made a
  good eighteenth-century politician, for the parliamentary game was the very
  breath of his nostrils. All his life he had been the typical good boy and
  prize pupil. At school he had not been regarded as clever, but he had worked
  like a beaver; at the University there were many who called him stupid, but
  nevertheless he had won high honours in the schools. It was the same with
  games. He was never a good cricketer, but he was in his School Eleven, and at
  Cambridge, by dint of assiduous professional coaching in the vacations, he
  managed to attain his Blue&mdash;and failed disastrously in the 'Varsity
  match. He seemed to have the knack of just getting what he wanted with
  nothing to spare, but, since the things that he wanted were numerous and
  important, he presented a brilliant record to the world.</p>

  <p>He was the only son of a well-to-do Lancashire manufacturer, and had no
  need to trouble about money. He was devouringly ambitious&mdash;not to do
  things, but to be things. I doubt if he cared much for any political cause,
  but he was set upon becoming a prominent statesman. He began as a Tory
  democrat, an inheritor of some threads of Disraeli's mantle. He went to
  Germany to study industrial problems, lived at a settlement in Rotherhithe,
  even did a spell of manual labour in a Birmingham factory&mdash;all the
  earnest gestures that are supposed to imply a tender heart and a forward-
  looking mind. He got into Parliament just before the War as a Conservative
  Free-trader for a Midland county constituency where his father had a house,
  and made himself rather conspicuous by a mild support of the Government's
  Irish Home Rule policy. In the War he lay very low; he had opportunely
  remembered that his family had been Quakers, and he had something to do, from
  well back at the base, with a Quaker ambulance. After peace he came out
  strong for the League of Nations, bitterly criticised the Coalition, was
  returned in '22 as an Independent, made a spectacular crossing of the floor
  of the House, and in '23 was the Labour member for a mining area in Durham,
  with a majority of five figures. He was an under-secretary of the Labour
  Government of '29, and, when Trant became Prime Minister, he entered his
  Cabinet as President of the Board of Trade. As such he was responsible for
  the highly controversial Factory Bill to which I have referred earlier in
  this story.</p>

  <p>A rich bachelor, he had no other interest than public life, or rather
  every other interest was made to subserve that end. He used to say grandly,
  in Bacon's phrase, that he had "espoused the State," which was true enough if
  husband and wife become one flesh, for he saw every public question through
  the medium of his own career. In many ways he was not a bad fellow; indeed,
  you would have said the worst of him in calling him an arriviste and a
  professional politician.</p>

  <p>The first point to remember is that he had not a very generous allowance
  of brains, but made his share go a long way. He carefully nursed his
  reputation, for he knew well that he had no great margin. He cherished his
  dignity, too, cultivated a habit of sardonic speech, and obviously longed to
  be respected and feared. A few simple souls thought him formidable and most
  people esteemed his industry, for he toiled at every job he undertook, and
  left nothing to chance. For myself, I never could take him quite seriously.
  He was excellent at a prepared statement, which any Treasury clerk could do
  as well as a Minister, but when you got to grips with him in debate he funked
  and rode off on a few sounding platitudes. Also I cannot imagine any man,
  woman or child being moved by his harangues, for he had about as much
  magnetism as a pillar-box.</p>

  <p>The second thing to remember is that he knew that he was second-rate, in
  everything except his industry and the intensity of his ambition. Therefore
  he was a great student of tactics. He was determined to be Prime Minister,
  and believed that by a close study of the possible moves of the political cat
  he might succeed. So far he had done well, for he would never have had
  Cabinet rank if he had remained a Tory. But one realised that he was not
  quite easy, and that his eyes were always lifting anxiously over the party
  fence. Let me add that most people did not suspect his gnawing ambition, or
  his detachment from anything that might be called principles, for there was a
  heavy, almost unctuous, earnestness about his oratorical manner. He was
  clever enough, when the ice was thin, not to be too fluent, but to let broken
  sentences and homely idioms attest the depth of his convictions.</p>

  <p>Believing firmly in Moe, he believed in the fragment of revelation which
  had been vouchsafed him, and was set on making the most of it. Waldemar, the
  Liberal leader, would be Prime Minister a year hence, and he pondered deeply
  how he could turn this piece of news to his advantage... The first thing was
  to discover how it could possibly come about. He naturally thought first of a
  coalition between Labour and Liberal, but a little reflection convinced him
  of its unlikelihood, for Trant and Waldemar were the toughest kind of
  incompatibles.</p>

  <p>Waldemar was a relic of Victorian Liberalism, a fanatical Freetrader, an
  individualist of the old rock. He was our principal exponent of the League of
  Nations, and had made an international reputation by his work for world
  peace. By profession a banker, he looked like a most impressive
  cleric&mdash;Anglican, not Nonconformist&mdash;with his lean, high-boned
  face, his shaggy eyebrows, and his superb, resonant voice. He was far the
  best speaker in the House, for he could reel off, without preparation, model
  eighteenth-century prose, and he was also a formidable debater; but he was a
  poor parliamentarian, for his mind lacked flexibility. He awed rather than
  conciliated, and, with his touch of fanaticism, was apt to be an inept
  negotiator.</p>

  <p>Derrick Trant was his exact opposite. He was the most English thing that
  God ever made, and, like most typical Englishmen, was half Scots. He had
  drifted into the Labour Party out of a quixotic admiration for the doings of
  the British rank-and-file in the War, and he proved extraordinarily useful in
  keeping that precarious amalgam together. For all sections both liked and
  trusted him, the solid Trade Union lot and the young bloods alike, for his
  simplicity and single-heartedness. He had clearly no axe to grind, and the
  ordinary Labour man was willing to be led by one whose ancestors had fought
  at Crécy; the extremists respected his honesty, and the moderates believed in
  his common sense. He represented indeed the greatest common denominator of
  party feeling. He had instincts rather than principles, but his instincts
  were widely shared, and his guileless exterior concealed a real shrewdness. I
  have heard him again and again in the House pull his side out of a mess by
  his powers of conciliation. He made no secret of his dislike of Waldemar. It
  was the secular antipathy of the nationalist to the internationalist, the
  Englishman to the cosmopolitan, the opportunist to the doctrinaire, the
  practical man to the potential fanatic.</p>

  <p>Mayot soon decided that there was nothing doing in that quarter. The
  alliance, which would put Waldemar into office, must be with the Tories. At
  first sight it seemed impossible. The party to which I have the honour to
  belong had been moving steadily towards Protection, and had preached a
  stringent policy of safeguarding as the first step towards the cure of
  unemployment. Waldemar had taken the field against us, and seemed to hope to
  engineer a Liberal revival on a Free-trade basis, and so repeat the triumph
  of 1906. On the other hand, there was the personality of our leader to be
  remembered. Geraldine was by far the greatest parliamentarian of our time and
  the adroitest party chief. Like Mayot, he was a professional, and the game
  was never out of his mind. Being mostly Irish in blood, he had none of
  Trant's Englishness or Waldemar's iron dogmas; his weapons were endless
  ingenuity, audacity and humour. He wanted to return to power, and might use
  the Liberals to oust the Government. But in that case why should Waldemar be
  Prime Minister? Geraldine would never kill Charles to make James king...
  Mayot could reach no conclusion, and resolved to wait and watch.</p>

  <p>The parliamentary session through six blistering weeks dragged itself to a
  close. The Budget debate was concluded after eight all-night sittings, the
  Factory Bill passed its third reading and went to the Lords, and there was
  the usual massacre of lesser measures. It had been Mayot's habit to go to
  Scotland for the autumn vacation, for he had a good grouse moor and was a
  keen shot. But that year he changed his plans and resolved to stalk
  Waldemar.</p>

  <p>Now, Waldemar was something of a valetudinarian, and every year, after the
  labours of the session, was accustomed to put himself for some weeks in the
  hands of an eminent physician who dwelt in the little town of Erdbach in the
  Black Forest. Moreover, Waldemar was not like Geraldine and Mayot himself; he
  had hobbies other than politics, and, just as Sir Derrick Trant was believed
  to be more interested in Gloucester cattle, wild white clover and dry-fly
  fishing than in Parliament, so Waldemar was popularly supposed to prefer the
  study of birds to affairs of State. Mayot, professing anxiety about his blood
  pressure, became an inmate of Dr Daimler's kurhaus, and prepared himself for
  his task by a reading of small popular works on ornithology.</p>

  <p>At Erdbach he spent three weeks. I happened to meet him there, for I
  stopped at the principal hotel for two days while motoring to Switzerland,
  and ran across him in Waldemar's company while taking an evening walk.
  Waldemar had no particular liking for Mayot, but he had nothing definitely
  against him except his politics, and the two had never been much pitted
  against each other in the House. When I saw them they seemed to have reached
  a certain degree of intimacy, and Mayot was listening intelligently to a
  discourse on the Alpine swift, and trying to identify a specimen of tit which
  Waldemar proclaimed was found in Britain only in the Spey valley. The Liberal
  leader was in a holiday mood, and he was flattered, no doubt, by Mayot's
  respectful docility.</p>

  <p>He talked, it seemed, a great deal of politics, and one of Mayot's
  suspicions was confirmed. He was slightly more civil about the Tories than
  about the Government. Geraldine, indeed, he profoundly distrusted, but he was
  quite complimentary about certain of Geraldine's colleagues. And he made two
  significant remarks. British politics, he thought, were moving back to the
  old two-party division, and in his opinion the most dangerous reactionary
  force was Sir Derrick Trant. Trant was the legitimate leader and the natural
  exponent of diehard Conservatism&mdash;a class-consciousness which would in
  the long run benefit the capitalist, and a chauvinism which might plunge his
  country into war... After a rather tedious three weeks Mayot returned to his
  neglected grouse, with a good deal of vague information about birds, and a
  clear conviction that there had been several pourparlers between Waldemar and
  the Tories. He seemed to have got the pointer he wanted.</p>

  <p>But a fortnight later he changed his mind. Geraldine's chief lieutenant, a
  man of whom Waldemar had spoken with approval, addressed a political
  demonstration in the park of an Aberdeenshire castle. The speech, which
  became famous as the "Issachar speech," was a violent attack upon the
  Liberals. Labour was dismissed as a confusion of thought based upon
  honourable inclinations, but Liberalism was denounced as a deliberate
  blindness, an ossification of heart and an atrophy of brain. What were the
  boasted "Liberal principles," the speaker asked, but dead and decomposing
  relics? Waldemar was described as Issachar, an "ass between two burdens," one
  being his precious dogmas and the other a deadweight of antediluvian
  jealousies and fears.</p>

  <p>Mayot, who read the speech one evening after coming in from a
  grouse-drive, decided with a sigh that he must try a cast on another
  line.</p><br>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p>The autumn session began under the shadow of unemployment. The figures
  were the worst since the War, and it was generally believed would pass the
  three million point by Christmas. Industries which six months before had been
  slightly on the upgrade were now going back, and industries which had been
  slightly depressed were now going downhill with a rush. People began to talk
  of a national emergency Government, and a speech of Trant's was interpreted
  as a feeler. Mayot pricked up his ears and set himself to study the
  omens.</p>

  <p>It was clear that there was no friendliness between Waldemar and
  Geraldine. The spirit of the Issachar speech was apparent in the first
  debate, and there were some brisk passages in the House between the two
  leaders. Then Geraldine went on the stump in Scotland and the industrial
  north. His one theme was unemployment, and he had enormous meetings
  everywhere, with enthusiastic overflows. He really felt the tragedy of the
  situation, and he gave the unemployed the feeling that he understood their
  case and would stick at nothing to find a remedy. There was no doubt that he
  made headway as against the inertness of the Prime Minister, who was in the
  hands of the Treasury officials, and the stubborn formalism of Waldemar.</p>

  <p>At Durham he outlined his programme, the chief point in which was a new
  emigration policy. Thousands, he said, had been permanently disinherited from
  the work for which they had been trained; certain industries must face the
  fact of a permanent reduction to a lower level; what was to be done with the
  displaced? Trant had a transference scheme working, but it could only account
  for a fraction. The resources of the Empire must be brought in to meet the
  deficiencies of one part of it. The Dominions had virgin land, unharnessed
  power; Britain had the human material; the situation was ripe for a deal.
  Geraldine proposed to short-circuit the whole existing emigration machinery.
  He had been in Canada the year before, and had fixed upon two areas, one in
  British Columbia and the other on the Peace River, for a great national
  experiment. He proposed to buy or lease the land from the Canadian
  Government, exactly as a private citizen might acquire a Canadian estate.
  Then he proposed to call the best business talent in Britain and Canada to
  his aid, and to establish a new chartered company to develop the area. Roads
  and railways would be built, townships laid out, water and electric power
  provided, just as in a scheme of private development. Unskilled jobs in the
  preliminary construction would be found at once for thousands of the
  unemployed in Britain, and in the meantime others would be put into training
  for farm and industrial work later. The new settlements would be not only
  agricultural, but also industrial, and whole industrial units would be
  transplanted bodily from Britain. Each British district would contribute its
  quota of emigrants, and it was believed that, in a scheme which appealed so
  strongly to the imagination, so far from there being a disinclination to
  emigrate there would be a brisk competition to get on the quota. He
  foreshadowed a new chartered company of adventurers, like the Hudson Bay and
  the East India Companies, and he hoped to have it run by able business men
  whose reputation would be pledged to its success. It would be financed by a
  twenty million loan, issued with a guarantee by the British Government, and
  Geraldine believed that a good deal of money would be forthcoming for the
  purpose from the Dominions and even from the United States.</p>

  <p>This policy, preached in depressed areas with Geraldine's eloquence to
  audiences deep in the mire of unemployment, had a considerable success.
  Waldemar was, of course, in violent opposition. He harped on the iniquities
  and corruption of chartered companies in the past, and he ingeminated the
  word "inflation." Trant pooh-poohed the whole thing. You could not cure an
  ill, he said, by running away from it; he was a simple Englishman, who
  disliked a grandiose Imperialism run for the benefit of Jews. But the most
  serious disapproval was in Geraldine's own party&mdash;the "big business"
  group, who were afraid of the effect of such a loan on the markets. The
  younger Tories as a whole were enthusiastic, and, what is more&mdash;
  significant, the Left Wing of Labour blessed it cordially. It was their own
  line of country, the kind of thing they had been pressing on their otiose
  leader. Trant's life was made a burden to him by endless questions in the
  House from his own people, and Collinson, a young Labour member from the
  Midlands, declared that Geraldine was the best Socialist of them all, since
  he alone had the courage to use in an emergency the corporate power and
  intelligence of the State.</p>

  <p>Mayot considered hard. The omens pointed to an alliance between Waldemar
  and the Tory Right Wing. But how was that possible? The anti-Geraldine Tories
  were to a man Protectionists, and Waldemar and his party would die in the
  last ditch for Free Trade... What about a grouping of the Labour Left and the
  Tory Left? On the matter of ultimate principles, no doubt, there was a deep
  cleavage, for the most progressive young Tory would have nothing to do with
  Marxism. But after all, Marxism was becoming a very shadowy faith, and in
  practical politics it was easy to conceive Tory and Labour youth lining up.
  Both were natural Protectionists, and abominated Whiggism and all its ways.
  He noticed how in the House the two groups seemed to be friendly, and mingled
  constantly in the smoking-room. A volume of political essays had recently
  been published, to which Geraldine had written a preface, and the
  contributors included Collinson, Macleish, the Glasgow firebrand, and young
  Tories like Lord Lanyard and John Fortingall... But no! It was impossible, he
  decided. For the leader of such a combination would be Geraldine, whereas, as
  he knew, in eight months Waldemar would be Prime Minister. Victory would not
  follow such banners, so he tried another cast.</p>

  <p>At this point Sally Flambard took a hand. She suddenly appeared as a
  political hostess, and I do not think that Mayot had anything to do with it.
  Her husband was of course a Tory of an antique school, but Sally had not
  hitherto shown any political interest. Now she discovered that she believed
  in constitutional government and the old ways, and profoundly distrusted both
  Labour and Geraldine. The move, I think, was only another phase of Sally's
  restless activity. She had had her finger in most pies, and wanted a new one.
  Also she had acquired a regard for Waldemar. Being a New Englander, she had
  in her bones an admiration for the type of statesman represented by the
  fathers of her country&mdash;large, grave, gnomic, rhetorical men&mdash;and
  Waldemar seemed to her to be a judicious compound of Daniel Webster and
  Abraham Lincoln.</p>

  <p>Anyhow, she took to giving luncheon parties in Berkeley Square, at which
  much nonsense was spoken, especially by the hostess. You see, she misread
  Waldemar, and the initial mistake spoiled all her strategy. She thought that
  he was a natural leader and an original thinker, whereas he was primarily a
  mechanical instrument, discoursing&mdash;very beautifully no
  doubt&mdash;traditional music. She was convinced that she had only to bring
  him into touch with some of the solider Conservatives for them to feel that
  he was a demonic figure, a wedder of current realities to historic wisdom. So
  she got together some amazing gatherings of incompatibles. The materials, so
  far from being the essentials of good fare to be cooked by a skilful hand,
  were more like chemicals turned by their juxtaposition into explosives.</p>

  <p>Mayot was to be the trait d'union, the adroit outsider, who could combine
  the ill-assorted guests, preparatory to Waldemar's treatment. I don't know
  where she got her notion of him&mdash; probably from himself. I attended two
  of the luncheons, and they gave me some idea of Mayot's game. The plan was to
  unite the Tory Right and Centre (minus Geraldine) with the Liberals through a
  common dislike of viewy extravagance and a common trust in Waldemar.</p>

  <p>The result was high comedy. Waldemar, honest man, did his best. He tried
  to be civil to everybody in his pleasant old-fashioned way, but he had no
  single thing in common with nine out of ten of the Tories who sat at Sally's
  table. I could see Mayot trying to guide him into diplomatic paths, but
  Waldemar was far too hardset a being to play a part, even if he had wished
  to. He talked books and the classics to Sir Penton Furbast, the press
  magnate, who was more or less illiterate. He told stories of Gladstone, and
  expatiated on the glory that had died with him, to old Isaac Isaacson, whose
  life had been spent in a blind worship of Disraeli. Once he thought he had
  got hold of a batch of country gentlemen, and discoursed on a scheme he had
  for lightening the burdens on rural land by means of an ingenious tax on
  inflated stock-exchange values; but it was champagne, not country air, that
  gave them their high colour&mdash;all were noted market operators, and his
  talk scared them into fits. An impish fate seemed to brood over those
  luncheons. Waldemar talked disarmament to the chairman of the Navy League,
  and acidly criticised America to Wortley-Dodd, who had an American mother and
  mother-in-law. His only success was with me, for I had always rather liked
  him, and could talk to him about birds and the inaccuracies of the Greville
  Memoirs. But the real rock on which the thing shipwrecked was Protection.
  Every one of Sally's Tories was an earnest Protectionist, and, at the last
  luncheon just before Christmas, Waldemar told Ashley Bridges that Protection
  meant four million unemployed and the dissolution of the Empire, and Bridges
  retorted in so many words that he was a fool.</p>

  <p>Sally's parties were a most valuable experience for Mayot. He was
  progressing in his quest by the time-honoured method of trial and error. By
  this time he was perfectly clear on one point. No alliance was conceivable
  between Waldemar and the Tory rank-and-file, for a strong dislike of Trant
  and a growing suspicion of Geraldine would never surmount the tariff
  difficulty. So he turned to the only remaining combination which would suit
  his book&mdash;the Liberals and the Labour Right.</p>

  <p>I should have said that hitherto Mayot had never identified himself with
  any group in his party. He had been of the Centre, a Labour man sans phrase;
  one who would be able, without any compromising past, to incline, when the
  occasion arose, to the Right or to the Left. But clearly this detachment
  would soon be impossible. If Waldemar was to form a Government, it could only
  be with the help of the Labour Right, for it was difficult to imagine
  Collinson and his like having anything to do with one whom they had
  repeatedly described in public as a fatted calf. If he, Mayot, were to play a
  prominent part in that Government, it was therefore obligatory to get some
  hold on the section of his party which would support Waldemar. He must edge
  discreetly towards the Right Wing.</p>

  <p>Discretion was essential, and secrecy. He could not afford as yet to break
  with the Left, and he must give no sign of disloyalty to Trant. He needed a
  confederate, and he found in old Folliot the man he wanted.</p>

  <p>Folliot, as I have mentioned, was an elderly gossip, who had been a
  notable figure in the Edwardian era, but who since the War had become a bore.
  He appeared less regularly at smart dinner-parties, and fewer country houses
  were open to him. When I first came to London men drew near him, when the
  women had left the room, to hear his stories, and youth in the clubs made
  rather a cult of him. I remember congratulating myself on the privilege of
  being acquainted with one who had known all the great men in Europe for half
  a century. Now the poor old fellow was allowed to drink his port in lonely
  silence. He was a pathetic figure, and what chiefly grieved him was his
  exclusion from politics. He had never been anything of a serious politician,
  though he had twice sat for short terms in the House, but he had been a
  useful go-between. One of his virtues was that, though a notorious gossip, he
  could be trusted to be as secret as the grave in any business in which he was
  employed. He used never even to mention the things he had done&mdash;his
  negotiations as a young man with the Liberal-Unionists, or his very useful
  work over the House of Lords question in 1910&mdash;only grinned and looked
  wise when the topics came up. Folliot had his own point of honour.</p>

  <p>Lately he had come to affect Labour out of disgust at the neglect of his
  own people. He did not love Trant, who laughed at him, but he had some vogue
  among the feudal aristocracy of the trade unions, who liked what they
  regarded as a link with historic British policy. Mayot easily enlisted him,
  for he was a gullible old gentleman, and was flattered at being consulted. He
  discovered that he had a mission to restore the two-party system by a union
  of all soberly progressive forces. He himself had begun life as a follower of
  Harrington, and so had never cared for the straiter sect of the Carlton Club,
  and had always had his doubts about Protection. He foresaw a chance of
  reviving that decorous Whiggism for which he had always hankered, based upon
  the two solidest things in Britain&mdash;the middle-class Liberal and the
  intelligent working man.</p>

  <p>So during the early part of the new year he was happily busy. He gave a
  great many dinners, sometimes at his flat and sometimes at Brooks', to which
  were bidden trade-union members of Parliament, one or two members of the
  Government who were supposed to be disaffected towards Trant, and a number of
  carefully selected Liberals. Waldemar came once or twice and Mayot was
  invariably present. These dinners seem to have gone off very well, and no
  hint of them leaked into the press. It was a game which Mayot could play to
  perfection. He could see that already he was regarded with favour by the
  Liberal stalwarts, and a certain type of Labour man was coming to look with a
  new respect upon one who could interpret his honest prejudices and give them
  an air of political profundity. By the end of January he was very well
  satisfied. He had decided that he had forecast correctly the process which
  would lead to Waldemar's premiership, and had put himself in a position to
  reap the full advantage of his foreknowledge. What he hoped for, I think, was
  the Exchequer.</p><br>

  <h3>III</h3>

  <p>But with February came one of the unlooked-for upheavals of opinion which
  make politics such a colossal gamble. The country suddenly awoke to the
  meaning of the unemployment figures. These were appalling, and, owing to the
  general dislocation of world credit and especially to the American situation,
  held no immediate hope of improvement. The inevitable followed. Hitherto
  sedate newspapers began to shout, and the habitual shouters began to scream.
  Hunger-marchers thronged the highways to London; there were mass-meetings in
  every town in the North; the Archbishops appointed a day for public prayer;
  and what with deputations, appeals, and nagging questions in the House, the
  life of Trant became a burden.</p>

  <p>The crisis produced a prophet, too. It is curious how throughout our
  history, whenever there is a strong movement from below, the names of the new
  leaders are usually queer monosyllables. It was so in Jack Cade's rebellion,
  and in Venner's business during the Commonwealth, and in the early days of
  the Labour movement; and now we had the same phenomenon, as if the racial
  maelstrom at the foot of the ladder had thrown up remnants of a long-hidden
  world. The new prophet bore the incredible name of Chuff. From Tower Hill to
  Glasgow Green he stumped the land, declaring that our civilisation had broken
  down, that the crisis was graver than at the outbreak of the War, and
  demanding that the Government should act at once or admit their defeat. The
  remarkable thing about Chuff was that he was not an apostle of any single
  nostrum. He was a rather levelheaded young man, who had once been a sailor,
  and he was content to bring home to the national conscience the magnitude of
  the tragedy; the solution, he said, he left to cleverer people. He had real
  oratorical gifts, and what with Chuff on the platform and Collinson and his
  friends in the House, there was high confusion in domestic politics.</p>

  <p>Opinion was oddly cross-divided, but presently it sorted itself out into
  two groups. The Activists demanded instant and drastic action, and the
  Passivists&mdash;the name was given them by their opponents and made
  prejudice owing to its resemblance to Pacifists; they called themselves
  Constitutionalists&mdash;counselled patience, and went on steadily with local
  relief works, transference, the expediting of one or two big public
  utilities, and the other stock remedies. The Activists were a perfect Tower
  of Babel, all speaking different tongues. Some wanted an immediate
  application of Marxian Socialism. A big section, led by Collinson, had a
  fantastic scheme of developing the home markets by increased unemployment
  pay&mdash;a sort of lifting up of one's self by the hair. Most accepted
  Geraldine's emigration policy; and a powerful wing advocated a stringent
  tariff with a view to making the Empire a self-contained economic unit. The
  agreed point, you might say, of all sections was direct and immediate action,
  a considerable degree of State Socialism, and a very general repudiation of
  Free Trade.</p>

  <p>Activism, as I have said, cut clean across parties. Roughly its strength
  lay in the Labour Left and the Tory Left, and it was principally a back-bench
  movement, though Geraldine gave it a somewhat half-hearted blessing. Lord
  Lanyard and Collinson appeared on the same platforms in the country, and one
  powerful Tory paper supported the cause and sent special commissioners into
  the distressed areas to report. There was a debate on the Ministry of Labour
  estimates, in which the Labour Whips found themselves confronted with
  something very like a revolt. The Government was saved by the Liberals, but
  John Fortingall's motion was only lost by seven votes. This incident made the
  Passivists sit up and organise themselves. They had on their side Trant and
  the Labour Right and Centre, the whole of Waldemar's following, and the bulk
  of the Tories, Geraldine sitting delicately on the fence. But the debating
  ability&mdash;except for Waldemar and Mayot&mdash;was conspicuously with
  their opponents.</p>

  <p>It was now that Mayot became something of a figure. The path was being
  prepared for a Labour-Liberal coalition with Waldemar as leader&mdash;though
  he could not quite realise how the latter event would come about. In such a
  combination, if it took office, Trant might become Foreign Secretary, while
  he must make sure of the Exchequer. He made sure by hurling himself into the
  controversy with a vigour hitherto unknown in his career. He, who had always
  been a little detached and a good deal of a departmentalist, who had moreover
  been very respectful to his own extremists, now became a hard-hitting fanatic
  for moderation. He picked up some of Waldemar's apocalyptic mannerisms, and
  his parliamentary style acquired a full-throated ease. It shows how much the
  man was in earnest about his ambitions, that in a few weeks he should have
  forced himself to acquire a host of new arts. At that time I was so busy at
  the Bar that I was very little in the House, but, my sympathies being rather
  with the Activists, I had one or two brushes with Mayot. I found him a far
  more effective antagonist than before, for, though he was no better at
  argument, he could do what is usually more effective&mdash;denounce with
  apparent conviction.</p>

  <p>Events in March played into his hands, for India suddenly boiled over, and
  the new constitution which we had laboriously established there seemed to be
  about to fail. There was a good deal of rioting, which had to be suppressed
  by force, and a number of patriots went to gaol. This split the Activist
  group asunder, for Collinson went out bald-headed against what he called the
  "fascist" policy of the Government, and most of the Labour Left followed him,
  while the young Tories took precisely the other line and shudderingly
  withdrew from their colleagues, like a prim virgin who opportunely discovers
  deeps of infamy in her lover. Lanyard, indeed, who had humanitarian leanings,
  seized the occasion to become an Independent, and no longer received the
  party Whips, but John Fortingall and the others returned hastily to the fold.
  The Government handled the Indian situation with firmness, said its
  supporters&mdash;with cheap melodrama and blind brutality, said its
  critics&mdash;and it had behind it three-fourths of its own people, all the
  Liberals, and every Tory except Lanyard. Peace had revisited the tents of
  Israel.</p>

  <p>Mayot in those days was a happy man, for the world was ordering itself
  exactly according to his wishes. The course of things was perfectly clear.
  Unemployment was the issue that blanketed all others, and unemployment had to
  all intents obliterated party lines. India had broken up the Activist
  phalanx. The advocacy of quack remedies was left to a few wild men.
  Geraldine's grandiose emigration dream had faded out of the air, and the
  Tories were back in their old Protectionist bog, in which he was confident
  that the bulk of the country would never join them. He thought that he had
  trained himself to look at facts with cold objective eyes, and such was his
  reading of them. The economic situation was very grim, and likely to become
  grimmer, and the solution must be some kind of national emergency Government
  in which Waldemar would take the lead, for he alone had the requisite
  prestige of character and was in the central tradition of British policy,
  Trant would be glad to be a lieutenant instead of a leader, and he himself,
  as the chief liaison officer between Liberal and Labour, would have his
  choice of posts. His only anxiety concerned Flotter, now at the Exchequer.
  But Flotter was nearer the Left than himself, and farther from the Liberals,
  and could never command his purchase. Flotter was a dismal old man, whose
  reputation had been steadily decreasing, whereas in recent months he himself
  had added cubits to his political stature.</p>

  <p>So Mayot began to talk discreetly in private about the National Government
  which facts were making imperative. I heard him airing his views one night at
  a dinner of Lady Altrincham's, and at a luncheon of Folliot's, where I sat
  next to him, he did me the honour to throw a fly over me. I asked him what
  his selections would be, and he replied that such a Government would have all
  responsible Labour to choose from, and all the Liberal talent.</p>

  <p>"What about us?" I asked.</p>

  <p>He looked wise. "That is harder, since Geraldine sticks to his Protection.
  But we should be glad to have some of you&mdash;on terms. You yourself, for
  instance."</p>

  <p>"What puzzles me is, how you distinguish a National Government from a
  Coalition," I said. "Remember the word Coalition still stinks in the nostrils
  of most people."</p>

  <p>"A Coalition," he said gravely, "only shares the loot, but a National
  Government pools the brains."</p>

  <p>I grinned, and thanked him for the compliment.</p><br>

  <h3>IV</h3>

  <p>Just before the Easter recess I lunched with Sally Flambard. Her craze for
  Waldemar had gone, she had never liked Geraldine, and, save for Mayot, she
  had had very little to do with the Labour people. But now she had discovered
  Trant. She had been staying at a house in his own county, and he had come to
  dine, and she had at once conceived for him one of her sudden affections.
  There was a good deal of reason for that, for Trant was an extraordinarily
  attractive human being, whatever his defects might be as a statesman. Evelyn
  liked him too, though deploring his party label, for they were both sportsmen
  and practical farmers. The consequence was that Trant had become for the past
  month a frequent guest in Berkeley Square. It was a pleasant refuge for him,
  for he was not expected to talk politics, and he met for the most part people
  who did not know the alphabet of them.</p>

  <p>Trant and I had always been good friends, and on that April Wednesday when
  we found ourselves side by side, I had from him&mdash;what I usually
  got&mdash;a jeremiad on the boredom and futility of his profession.</p>

  <p>"I'm not like you," he lamented. "You've got a body of exact knowledge
  behind you, and can contribute something important&mdash;legal advice, I
  mean. But here am I, an ordinary ill-informed citizen, set to deal with
  problems that no mortal man understands and no human ingenuity can solve. I
  spend my time clutching at imponderables."</p>

  <p>I said something to the effect that his modesty was his chief
  asset&mdash;that at least he knew what he did not know.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he went on, "but, hang it, Leithen, I've got to fight with fellows
  who are accursedly cocksure, though they are cocksure about different things.
  Take that ass Waldemar... "</p>

  <p>Trant proceeded to give an acid, and not unjust, analysis of Waldemar and
  the way he affected him. The two men were as antipathetic as a mongoose and a
  snake. He was far too loyal to crab any of his own side to an opponent, but I
  could see that he was nearly as sick of Collinson and his lot, and quite as
  sick of Mayot. In fact, it looked as if there was now no obvious place for
  Trant in his party, since he was at war with his own Left Wing, and Mayot had
  virtually taken over the leadership of the Right and Centre. At that time we
  were all talking about the alliance of Liberal and Labour, and this
  conversation convinced me that it would not include Trant.</p>

  <p>Then he began to speak of ponderable things like fishing. He was just off
  to a beat on the Wye, and lamented the bad reports of the run of fish. Just
  as we were leaving the table he said something that stuck in my memory. He
  asked me what was the best text of the Greek Anthology, attributing to me
  more scholarship than I possessed... Now, Trant had always been bookish, and
  had a number of coy literary ambitions. I remembered that once, years before,
  he had confessed to me that, when he was quit of public life, he meant to
  amuse himself with a new translation of the Anthology. Meleager, I think, was
  his special favourite.</p>

  <p>I walked down to the House that afternoon with one assured conviction.
  Trant was about to retire. His air had been that of a schoolboy who meant to
  defy authority and hang the consequences. He had the manner of one who knew
  he was going to behave unconscientiously and dared anybody to prevent him.
  Also there was his Greek Anthology scheme.</p>

  <p>By this time I had a pretty shrewd idea of Mayot's purpose. That afternoon
  I sat next to him in the tearoom and tried to sound him. He looked at me
  sharply.</p>

  <p>"Have you heard anything?" he asked, and I told him "Not a word," but the
  whole situation seemed to me fluid.</p>

  <p>"Trant won't go till he has made certain of his successor," said Mayot.
  "And that won't be yet awhile."</p>

  <p>But Trant did go, leaving the succession gloriously unsettled. A fortnight
  later the papers published a letter from him to Flotter, the chairman of his
  party. It was a dignified performance, and there was finality in every
  syllable. Trant said he had placed his resignation in His Majesty's hands and
  that it had been graciously accepted. He proposed to retire altogether from
  public life, and would not be a candidate at the next election. He made no
  complaints, but offered his most grateful thanks to his party for their
  unfailing loyalty in difficult times, and expressed his warm hopes for a
  brilliant future... I had a line from him from the Spey, chiefly about
  fishing; but it ended with: "You did not think Master Silence a man of this
  mettle? Thank God it's over. Now I shall have peace to make my soul."</p>

  <p>I ran across Mayot next day, and he was fairly walking on his toes with
  excitement. His face was prim with weighty secrets. "The Consuls must see to
  it that the Republic takes no hurt," he said impressively. He was swollen
  with delicious responsibilities, and clearly believed that his hour had
  come.</p>

  <p>The next event was the party meeting. Mayot was generally fancied as
  Trant's successor, but to everybody's surprise, Flotter, the Chancellor of
  the Exchequer, was elected by nine votes. Flotter was of Mayot's persuasion,
  but he was slightly nearer to the Left perhaps; at any rate, he had not been
  so controversial a figure as Mayot, so he had the support of Collinson's
  merry men. Mayot did not seem to take the defeat much to heart, for he was
  looking well ahead. In a few weeks Waldemar would be Prime Minister, and he
  was the chief link between Waldemar and Labour.</p>

  <p>I was, of course, not in the confidence of the Cabinet, and can only judge
  by results. But I fancy that the decision to ask for a dissolution must have
  been chiefly Mayot's. You see, he knew one fact which was hidden from all the
  world, and he had to consider how this fact was coming to birth. If Flotter
  took office at once he would not readily be induced to resign, though he was
  an old man, not very strong in body, and never credited with much ability. An
  election was desirable on every ground for both the Labour and the Tory
  Parties were deeply divided, and the verdict of the polls would clear the
  air. Mayot had no doubt that the country was on the whole on the side of the
  kind of cautious progress represented by Waldemar and himself. The Tory Left
  had not been making much headway; Collinson and his group were discredited
  because of their attitude on India; and the appeal of the redoubtable Chuff
  had lost its first freshness. His chief fear was Geraldine, whose tactical
  skill he profoundly respected. But an immediate election would spike
  Geraldine's guns, since he had no new policy to urge, and, if he improvised
  one, would not have time to elaborate it.</p>

  <p>So Flotter was sent for by the King, and asked for a dissolution, which
  was granted. His Budget resolutions were hastily passed by a House whose
  interests were elsewhere, and in the second week of May the campaign
  began.</p><br>

  <h3>V</h3>

  <p>I have fought in my time seven elections, and can recollect a good many
  more, but I never knew one like this. My own seat was safe enough, and I was
  able to speak for our side up and down the land during the hottest May that I
  ever remember. But the whole thing was a nightmare, for in twenty-four hours
  all creeds and slogans were mixed up in a wild kaleidoscope. Very few
  candidates knew quite where they stood, and desperate must have been the
  confusion of the ordinary voter. Laboriously devised programmes became
  suddenly waste paper.</p>

  <p>The supreme fact was that Waldemar went mad, or had a call, or saw a
  vision like Paul on the road to Damascus. You can take which explanation you
  choose. He had been lying low for some weeks, touring about the country and
  scarcely opening his mouth. He must have discovered the horrors of
  unemployment for himself, just as Geraldine had discovered them seven months
  before when he started his emigration scheme. Out of the provinces came
  Waldemar, like Mahomet from the desert, to preach a new gospel.</p>

  <p>It was a complete reversal of all that he and Mayot had stood for. He was
  still a Free Trader, he proclaimed, and would have nothing to do with a
  self-contained Empire, chiefly on the ground that it would be a barrier to
  that internationalism on which the future of humanity depended. But he was
  quite prepared to prohibit the import of certain rival commodities altogether
  as an emergency measure, and he had a great scheme for State purchase in bulk
  and the regulation of prices. He went farther. He, who had once moaned
  "inflation" when Geraldine's loan was proposed, was now a convert to a huge
  loan for emergency public works. Moreover, he swallowed wholesale most of
  Collinson's stuff about increasing our home power of consumption, and
  proposed measures which made the hair of the ordinary economist stand on
  end.</p>

  <p>But it was not so much what Waldemar said as the way he said it. The old
  Activism was a stagnant pool compared to his furious torrent. He preached his
  heresies with the fire and conviction of an Israelitish prophet, and brought
  into the contest the larger spirit of an earlier age. He was quite frank
  about his conversion. He had had his eyes opened, and, like an honest man and
  a patriot, must follow the new light. It was the very violence of the
  revolution in his creed that made it so impressive. We had got into the habit
  of saying that the day of oratory was over, and that all that mattered was
  that a leader should be able to broadcast intelligibly. Waldemar disproved
  this in two days. He was a great orator, and he swept over the North and the
  Midlands like a flame. Gladstone's Midlothian campaign was beaten hollow. He
  motored from town to town in a triumphal procession, and every gathering he
  addressed was like a revivalist meeting, half the audience in tears and the
  rest too solemnised to shout. Wild as his talk was, he brought hope to those
  who had none, and stirred up the political waters as they had not been moved
  since the War.</p>

  <p>It was an awful position for everybody else. His own party, with a few
  exceptions, accepted him docilely, though they had some difficulty in
  accustoming themselves to the language. You see, the Liberals, having been
  long in the wilderness, were prepared to follow any Moses who would lead them
  across Jordan. There was a half-hearted attempt to make a deal about seats,
  so as to prevent unnecessary fights between Liberal and Labour, but it was a
  little too late for that, and we had the curious spectacle in many
  constituencies of official opponents saying precisely the same thing.
  Geraldine was in an awkward fix, for he had been a bit of an Activist and had
  his young entry to consider. He did the only thing possible&mdash;relapsed
  upon sobriety PLUS Protection, and did the best he could with tariffs and the
  Empire. But his form was badly cramped, and he had to face the unpleasing
  truth that he, the adroit tactician, had been tactically caught bending. His
  party, however, was well disciplined, and managed, more or less, to speak
  with one voice, though it was soon clear that many former Tory voters were
  being attracted by Waldemar.</p>

  <p>The Labour people were in a worse hole. Flotter, who was very little use
  in an election, steered a wary course, welcoming some of Waldemar's ideas,
  but entering a caveat now and then to preserve his consistency. His programme
  was a feeble stammering affair, for he was about as much of a leader to his
  party as a baggage pony in a mountaineering expedition. It was Collinson who
  took charge. He ranged the Labour Left solidly under Waldemar's banner, and
  became Waldemar's most efficient henchman. In the whirlwind tour before the
  poll he never left his leader's side.</p>

  <p>For the unhappy Mayot there was no place. Miracles do not happen in
  batches. What in the case of one man may be ascribed to the vouchsafement of
  divine light will in a second case be put down to policy. Mayot simply could
  not turn in his tracks. If he had, he would have become a public
  laughing-stock. His denunciation of Activism had been too wholehearted, his
  devotion to economic sanity too complete. So he did nothing. He never spoke
  outside his own constituency, where he was opposed by the formidable Chuff,
  who stood as a Labour Independent. I gather that he talked a lonely
  Waldemarism, which Waldemar himself was busily engaged in tearing to
  tatters.</p>

  <p>I got the final results at a Perthshire inn. Mayot was badly beaten: a
  small thing in itself, for another seat would have been found for him if he
  had mattered anything to any party&mdash; which he did not. There had been
  the expected defection of Tory voters. The Liberals had done well at our
  expense owing to Waldemar's name, and all the Labour Left were back with big
  majorities. So far as I remember, the figures were 251 Labour, 112 Liberals,
  290 Tories, and 12 Independents. The country had approved a Coalition.</p>

  <p>I went down to stay with Trant for a weekend in the May-fly season. The
  new Cabinet had just been announced&mdash;Waldemar, Prime Minister; Collinson
  at the Ministry of Labour; Flotter back at the Exchequer; and Lord Lanyard at
  the Foreign Office.</p>

  <p>Trant, in disreputable clothes, was soaking gut and tying on flies.</p>

  <p>"There has been a good deal of trouble," he told me. "Our party didn't
  want Waldemar. They thought that the leader should come from them, and I
  gather that Waldemar would have been quite willing to stand down if there had
  been anybody else. But there wasn't. You couldn't put Flotter in charge.</p>

  <p>"Poor old Mayot," he went on, his pleasant face puckered into a grin.
  "Politics are a brutal game, you know. Here is an able fellow who makes one
  mistake and finds himself on the scrap-heap. If he hadn't been so clever he
  would be at No. 10 today... Of course he would. If he had even been like
  Flotter, and trimmed from sheer stupidity, he would have been Prime Minister
  ... I must say I rather respect him for backing his fancy so steadily. He was
  shrewd enough to spot the winner, but not the race it would win. Thank God, I
  never pretended to have any cleverness...."</p>

  <h2><a name="chap4"
     id="chap4">IV. &mdash; MR REGINALD DAKER</a></h2>

  <p class="poem">"As when a Gryfon through the wilderness,<br>
  With wingèd course o'er Hill or moarie Dale,<br>
  Pursues the Arimaspian."<br>
  <br>
  &mdash;John Milton, Paradise Lost</p>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p>I can tell this story out of the fullest knowledge, for Reggie Daker had
  long made it a habit to pour out to me his inmost mind. But he was such an
  inconsequent being that it was not always easy to follow the involutions of
  that mind. So if my narrative has ragged edges it is because of its principal
  figure, who had a genius for discontinuity.</p>

  <p>He had read in that upper room at Flambard quite clearly an announcement
  of an expedition to Yucatan, of which he was a member, and which was alleged
  to have left England on June nineth the following year. Now, Reggie believed
  in Moe more implicitly than any of us, for one of his chief traits was a
  profound credulity. But he did not in the least believe in the announcement.
  Or rather let me put it that, while he was quite certain that the words he
  read would be in The Times a year hence, he was not less certain that they
  did not concern him. Nothing would induce him to go to Yucatan or any place
  of the kind. He did not trouble to consider how he was to square his belief
  in the accuracy of this piece of foreknowledge with his determination that it
  should not be true in fact. He only knew that he was not going to budge from
  England.</p>

  <p>He did not know where Yucatan was, for he had the vagueness about
  geography which distinguishes the products of our older public schools and
  universities, and he had not the curiosity to enquire. He fancied that it
  must be in the East; places ending in "tan" were always in the East; he
  remembered Afghanistan, Baluchistan, Gulistan. But, east or west, it mattered
  nothing to him. A man could not be hustled off abroad unless he wanted to,
  and nothing was farther from his inclinations.</p>

  <p>Reggie was one of a type created by the post-war world. My nephew Charles,
  who was seven years his senior, and had been much battered by campaigning,
  said that it comforted him to look at Reggie, for it made him realise that
  the War chapter was really closed. His mother had died when he was a baby,
  and his father fell in the Yeomanry fight at Suvla, leaving him a small
  family property in the Midlands. A sudden industrial expansion made this
  property valuable, and in the boom year after peace his trustees sold it for
  a big sum, so that Reggie went to Oxford with a considerable income and no
  encumbrances. He was not distinguished at the University except for his power
  to amass friends. He had the family gift of horsemanship, and for a time
  showed extraordinary energy in riding in "grinds" and country steeplechases.
  Reggie, with his kit in a brown-paper parcel, might have been seen catching
  very early trains for remote places. But the craze passed, though his love of
  horses endured, and Reggie settled down to make a comfortable nest for
  himself in life.</p>

  <p>His intellectual powers were nothing to boast of, but no man had a finer
  collection of interests. He had a knack of savouring the quality of a variety
  of things, never going far below the surface, but getting the maximum of
  pleasure for the minimum of pains. He dabbled in everything&mdash;art,
  literature, field sports, society, even a little corner of philanthropy. He
  was modest, eager, enthusiastic, and as generous a soul as God ever made.
  Also he had a pretty talent for sheer farcical fun. The result was that he
  was widely popular, for in his innocent way he oxygenated the air around him.
  He had been a member of Pop at Eton, though he had no athletic or scholastic
  distinctions, and he went down from the University with a larger equipment of
  friends&mdash;not acquaintances merely, but friends&mdash; than any of his
  contemporaries.</p>

  <p>He cast about for a job, for he had a conscience of a sort, but, as I have
  already mentioned, he was a difficult creature to fit into any niche. He was
  too mercurial, and after a week or two managed to tumble out. But all the
  time he had his own private profession. His purpose was to make an art of
  English life. The ritual of that life had been badly dislocated by the War,
  but enough remained to fascinate Reggie. He was in love with every detail of
  the ordered round which carried youth of his type from January to January. He
  adored London in all her moods&mdash;the snugness of her winters, new faces
  at dinner-parties, the constant meetings of friends, plays and books, glossy
  ponies and green turf at Roehampton, cricket matches and race meetings, the
  view over St. James's Park in May, Piccadilly in summer, Kensington Gardens
  in their October russet. Nor did he appreciate less the rural background to
  London's life&mdash;riverside lawns, a cutter on the Solent in a fresh
  breeze, smoky brown coverts in the December dusks, purple Scots twilights
  when the guns moved homeward from the high moors. Reggie was supremely
  content with the place where his lines had been cast. It seemed to him that,
  if he lived to the age of Methuselah, he could not exhaust England.</p>

  <p>He had a pleasant little house near the Brompton Road, where an elderly
  couple looked after his wants. He belonged to two good clubs&mdash;one a
  young man's and the other an old man's&mdash;and enjoyed them both. He hunted
  regularly with the Saturday Bicester, had a rod on a dry-fly stream in
  Berkshire, went every year on a round of Scots visits, and, being an
  excellent shot, was a welcome guest at covert shoots. Indeed, Reggie was a
  welcome guest anywhere, for he had the gift of making whatever he did seem
  better worth doing to those who companioned him. His enthusiasm, which was
  never boring, put colour and light into other people's worlds. I have come
  down to breakfast before a day's partridge shooting, apathetic about the
  prospect, and have been compelled by Reggie to look forward to it with the
  ardour of a boy. Small wonder he was popular; many people remain young, but
  few can communicate youthfulness.</p>

  <p>You must understand that he was no undiscriminating epicurean. Every day
  he was developing a more perfect technique of appreciation. It sounds a
  selfish and effeminate mode of spending one's time, and certainly there was
  nothing of the strenuous life about Reggie. He had no inclination to buffet
  opponents about the head and build up the Empire. But he was so warm-hearted
  and friendly that people were very ready to condone a slight lack of
  virility, the more so as he had considerable repute as a bold man to hounds.
  For myself, though now and then he exasperated me, on the whole it did me
  good to contemplate anyone so secure and content.</p>

  <p>Reggie was wise enough to see that he needed some string to unite his many
  interests and give some sort of continuity to his life. So he was on the
  look-out for a regular job, occasionally found one, and invariably lost it.
  Then he decided that his avocation lay in the sale of old books. He had
  always been rather bookish, and had picked up a good deal of general
  information on the subject. It fitted in perfectly with his other tastes and
  the general tenour of his existence. He took to frequenting sales, cultivated
  dealers and collectors, enlarged his American acquaintance, and on a
  country-house visit made a point of investigating the library.</p>

  <p>So at the time of the Flambard Whitsuntide party he had started in a
  modest way as a dealer in old books, specialising in the English seventeenth
  century. He had had a few successes, and was full of hope. Here was a
  profession which in no way interfered with his rule of life, was entrancing
  in itself, and might repair the ravages which the revenue authorities were
  making in his private income.</p>

  <p>He came to lunch with me in London in July, and I realised that the
  impression made by Moe was fast disappearing. "Terrible business," said
  Reggie. "I'm hanged if I quite know what happened, for, looking back, I think
  we were all asleep. Oh, I read The Times all right. It said I had started off
  to a place called Yucatan with an expedition. Rotten idea!"</p>

  <p>I asked him if he believed in the reality of his vision.</p>

  <p>"Of course," he replied. "I can't explain how&mdash;no one can, except
  poor old Moe, and he's dead&mdash;but I read the words in the paper as
  clearly as I am seeing you."</p>

  <p>"You think they are true&mdash;will be true?"</p>

  <p>"I think that they will appear in The Times of June tenth next year. True
  in that sense. But not true in the sense that I shall have gone to Yucatan.
  Catch me doing anything so idiotic! Forewarned, forearmed, you know."</p>

  <p>And Reggie plunged into an account of the pirated pre-first edition of the
  Religio Medici, of which he had heard of a copy.</p><br>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p>So he went off to Scotland for the Twelfth, quite easy in his mind. He
  rarely thought about the Moe business, and, when he did, it was only to
  reflect with some amusement that in ten months' time an eminent newspaper
  would be badly out in its facts. But he was thinking a great deal about
  Pamela Brune.</p>

  <p>We have all our own Scotlands, and Reggie's was not mine, so we never met
  north of the Tweed. He would have abhorred the rougher kind of deer forest,
  for he would never have got up the mountains, and he was no salmon fisherman.
  The kind of place he liked was a civilised country house where the comforts
  of life were not forgotten. He was a neat shot at driven grouse, and loved a
  day on a mild moor where you motored to the first butts and had easy walks to
  the others. He liked good tennis and golf to be available on by-days, and he
  liked a large house-party with agreeable women. Reggie was the very opposite
  of the hard-bitten sportsman; sport was for him only one of the amenities of
  life, a condiment which should not be taken by itself, but which in
  combination gave flavour to the dish. So he selected his visits carefully,
  and was rarely disappointed.</p>

  <p>This year he had an additional purpose; he went where he thought it likely
  that he might meet Pamela Brune. He believed himself to be very much in love,
  and he still had hopes; for in the last few weeks of the season Pamela had
  been a little kinder. She had been rather gentle and abstracted, and he hoped
  that her heart might be softening towards him.</p>

  <p>He did not meet Pamela Brune, for reasons which I shall have to record
  elsewhere. But he had a very pleasant two months in comfortable dwellings,
  varied with a week in a yacht among the Western Isles. It was a fine autumn
  in the north, and Reggie returned with a full sketch-book&mdash;he dabbled in
  water-colours&mdash;and a stock of new enthusiasms. He had picked up a lot of
  folklore in the Hebrides, had written a good deal of indifferent verse in
  Pamela's honour, had conceived a scheme for the making of rugs with Celtic
  designs coloured by the native Highland dyes, and had learned something about
  early Scottish books&mdash;David Lyndesay and the like&mdash;on which he
  hoped to specialise for the American market. He meant to develop these lines
  in the pleasant London winter to which he was looking forward.</p>

  <p>Only one visit had been a failure. He had known Lamancha for some years as
  a notable connoisseur of pictures, and he had gladly accepted an invitation
  to Leriot. But Lamancha in Scotland was a very different person from Lamancha
  in London. Reggie found a party of men only, and with none of them, not even
  his host, did he appear to have much in common. They shot all day on the
  famous Leriot moors, and there he acquitted himself reasonably well, though
  he found the standard higher than elsewhere. But it was the evenings that
  proved out of joint. Eight sleepy men gossiped in the smoking-room till they
  stumbled to bed, and the talk was of two things only. All except Reggie had
  served in the War, and half the evenings were spent in campaign reminiscences
  which bored him profoundly. "Worse than golf shop," he complained to me. But
  the conversation of the other half scared him, for it was all about
  adventures in outlandish parts of the globe. It seemed that everyone but
  himself had sojourned in the oddest places. There was Maffit who had solved
  the riddle of the Bramaputra gorges, and Beavan who had been the first to
  penetrate the interior of New Guinea and climb Carstensz, and Wilmer who had
  been with the second Everest expedition, and Hurrell who had pursued his
  hobby of birds to the frozen tundras of the Yenesei. Apparently they were not
  garrulous; but they spoke of their doings with a quiet passion which
  frightened Reggie. They were all men of some distinction in English life, but
  they talked as if what they were now doing was the merest triviality, and the
  real world for them lay across the seas. Even Lamancha, who was supposed to
  have the ball at his feet in politics, confessed that he would give up
  everything for the chances of being the first man to cross the great desert
  of southern Arabia.</p>

  <p>To me later Reggie waxed eloquent on his discomfort.</p>

  <p>"You never saw such a set of toughs," he said. "Real hearties."</p>

  <p>I grinned at the word, and pointed out that "hearty" scarcely described
  the manner of Lamancha or Hurrell or Beavan.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I don't mean that they were the cheery, backslapping type of lad.
  Their style was more like frozen shell-fish. But they were all the lean,
  hard-bitten, Empire-building breed. To listen to them you would think it was
  a kind of disgrace to enjoy life at home as long as there was some filthy
  place abroad where they could get malaria and risk their necks. They made me
  feel an abject worm... And, hang it all, you know, they began to infect me
  with their beastly restlessness. I was almost coming to believe that I was a
  cumberer of the ground, and should take up the white man's burden or do
  something silly. They were such cocksure pagans&mdash;never troubled to
  defend their views, but took it for granted that everybody but a
  hermaphrodite must share them."</p>

  <p>There had been one exception, a middle-aged man called Tallis, who had a
  place in Wales. He was an antiquary of sorts, and appeared in his time to
  have done his bit of globe-trotting, but he was now settled at home, and had
  inherited a fine library about which he was willing to talk. But the rest had
  been repellent, and what scared Reggie was that they had not been repellent
  enough. He had been attracted against his will; he had felt himself being
  slowly drawn into an atmosphere utterly at variance with all his tastes. He
  uneasily remembered Flambard. These men were mostly Oriental travellers, and
  somewhere in the East lay Yucatan... Reggie cut short his visit to Leriot,
  and fled for safety to Town.</p>

  <p>There he found what seemed to be complete sanctuary, and presently the
  memory of Leriot and its outlanders grew dim. He lapped himself in urban
  peace. By Christmas he had realised that Pamela Brune was not for him, and,
  being a philosophic soul, accepted the fact with resignation. He found many
  consolations in his life. The economic troubles which hit most people did not
  greatly affect a rentier like Reggie, whose modest but sufficient investments
  were widely and wisely distributed. He had enough exercise and fresh air to
  keep him fit&mdash;regular golf, an occasional day with the Bicester and an
  occasional covert-shoot, and he took care that the company he kept was very
  different from that of Leriot. The people he met on his shooting visits were
  mostly from the City, and their one aim was to recover a lost stability. The
  older men talked with longing of the comfortable Edwardian days, and Reggie
  wholeheartedly shared their regrets. All the world he mixed with seemed to be
  converted to his own view of life, Lamancha, making speeches in the House and
  presiding at public dinners, was very unlike the savage who at Leriot had
  sighed for the Arabian desert. Even Hurrell, whom he saw occasionally in one
  of his clubs, was a respectable black-coated figure, more concerned with a
  paper he was to read to the Royal Society than with the Siberian tundras.</p>

  <p>Reggie had rarely spent more agreeable months. During November and
  December there was a good deal of frost, and London had never seemed at once
  so tonic and so cosy. Being a good-hearted fellow he did a little mild
  philanthropy, and sat on a committee which took care of several distressed
  mining villages, besides putting in one evening a week at his boys' club. For
  the rest he had his pleasant little dinners of selected friends, his club
  luncheons, his researches at the Museum, his plays and picture shows, and his
  steadily growing bibliophilic fervour. And behind everything he did was the
  delicious background of London, which linked up the centuries and made even
  the new and the raw seem long-descended&mdash;an atmosphere which at once
  soothed and stimulated&mdash;the last perfection of man's handiwork&mdash;
  the true setting for a civilised life.</p>

  <p>He made real progress, too, with his book-selling, and it looked as if he
  had found at last the thing he could do well. It was the kind of subject
  which Reggie could cope with, for he had an excellent memory, and, when his
  interest was actively engaged, a real power of absorbing knowledge. Also the
  times suited him, for there was a slump in everything but books. Pictures,
  furniture, houses, land&mdash;there were plenty of sellers and few buyers;
  but in books the demand kept level with the supply. Hard-up country gentry
  put their libraries into the market, and it was often possible to buy these
  privately at modest prices. Reggie had several such lucky speculations, and
  found that often half a dozen volumes returned him his outlay with a handsome
  profit.</p><br>

  <h3>III</h3>

  <p>Then in January a little thing happened which had momentous
  consequences.</p>

  <p>He picked up a cheap lot of books at a sale in the Midlands, and one of
  these was a copy of a little-known political poem of Thomas Gray, called, I
  think, The Candidate. It was printed in the familiar Caslon type of the
  Strawberry Hill press, and it had on the fly-leaf a long inscription to a
  certain Theophilus Tallis, in which comment was made on the poet and his
  work. The inscription was signed "HW," and on the inside of the cover was the
  armorial bookplate of Tallis of Libanus Hall. If this inscription were
  genuine, here was an "association" book of a high order. Reggie compared it
  with many specimens of Horace Walpole's handwriting, with the general style
  of which it seemed to agree. Could he establish the identity of Theophilus
  Tallis, and ascertain that he had been a friend of Walpole's, the
  authenticity would be complete... Then he remembered the man he had met at
  Leriot. His name was Tallis, and he had a place on the Welsh border. Reggie
  had scribbled down his club address, so he wrote to him there and asked him
  for information. In a day or two a reply came from Libanus Hall. The
  Theophilus in question was his great-grandfather, said the writer, and
  doubtless the book had strayed from his library. Such things often
  happened&mdash; an undergraduate would carry off a volume to Oxford and
  forget about it, or a guest would borrow and fail to return. The old
  Theophilus had left many papers which had never been examined, but in which
  the connection with Walpole could no doubt be traced. Let Reggie pay him a
  visit, for there were many things in his library to interest him.</p>

  <p>So in the last week of January Reggie departed for the Welsh marches. The
  association of Tallis with Leriot gave him no anxiety, for recently he had
  been so lapped in urban life that he had forgotten about Leriot and its
  uneasy guests, and in any case Tallis had been different from the others.
  Tallis had not looked like them, for he was a man of a comfortable habit of
  body, with a round, high-coloured face&mdash;a hunting squire with a dash of
  the bon vivant. Reggie remembered with satisfaction how he had criticised
  Lamancha's port. It was true that he seemed to have travelled much, but his
  wandering years were over. He had merely hinted at his doings abroad, but he
  had spoken at length and with gusto about his collections and his
  library.</p>

  <p>Libanus proved to be a dwelling after Reggie's heart, a Tudor manor-house,
  built round a border keep, according to the fashion of the Welsh marches. It
  stood on a shelf in a shallow river valley, backed with low, scrub-clad
  hills, and behind them were wide, rolling moorlands. It was a bachelor
  establishment, very well run, and Tallis was the perfect host. The
  collections did not interest Reggie&mdash;stone plaques, and queerly marked
  tiles, and uncouth stone heads which suggested a more primitive Epstein. He
  took them for Assyrian, and when Tallis called them "Mayan" the word conveyed
  nothing to him. But the library far surpassed his hopes. It had been founded
  in the seventeenth century, when Wales was full of lettered squires, by a
  certain John Tallis, who had obligingly kept a notebook in which he recorded
  his purchases and the prices he paid for them. It was especially rich in
  authors with a Welsh connection, like Henry Vaughan and the Herberts, but
  there was a fine set of Donne, two of the Shakespeare folios, and many of the
  Cavalier lyrists, besides a quantity of devotional and political rariora. The
  other collector in the family had been Theophilus Tallis in the reign of
  George III. He had specialised in illustrated books, mostly French, but he
  had also added to the shelves some notable incunabula, for he lived into the
  day of the Roxburghe and Heber libraries. Reggie hunted up Theophilus in the
  family archives, and found that he had been a friend of Gray and a frequent
  correspondent of Horace Walpole. There were batches of letters from both,
  which had never been published.</p>

  <p>Tallis was also a master of foxhounds, a mountainy pack, with some of the
  old shaggy Welsh strain in them, which hunted about a hundred square miles of
  wild country at the back of Libanus. The river valley was pockety and swampy,
  but the short bent of the moors made splendid going. Reggie was well mounted
  by his host, it was soft, grey weather in which scent lay well, and he had
  several glorious days up on the roof of things. "You never saw such a place,"
  he wrote to me. "Nothing much to lep, but you must ride cunning, as on
  Exmoor, if you want to keep up with hounds. I couldn't keep my eye on them
  for the scenery. One was on a great boss, with a hint far away of deeper
  valleys, and with lumps of blue mountain poking up on the
  horizon&mdash;foreshortened, you know, like ships coming into sight at sea.
  It fairly went to my head. Then the hunt was pure Sir Roger de
  Coverley&mdash; hard-riding farmers and squires that had never stirred from
  their paternal acres. I felt as if I had slipped through a chink of time into
  an elder England."</p>

  <p>Reggie enjoyed every moment, for it was the precise ritual in which his
  fancy delighted. He and Tallis would get home in the twilight, and have
  poached eggs and tea by the library fire. Then would come a blessed time in
  slippers with a book or a newspaper; then a bath and dinner; and after that a
  leisurely ranging among the shelves and pleasant sleepy armchair talk. Tallis
  was an ideal host in other ways than as a provider of good sport, good
  quarters and good fare. He never obtruded his own interests, never turned the
  talk to the stone monstrosities in the hall which he had given half his life
  to collect, or expounded the meaning of "Mayan." With Reggie he was the
  bibliophile and the rural squire, prepared to agree with him most cordially
  when he proclaimed that there was no place on earth like his own land and
  wondered why anyone was foolish enough to leave it.</p>

  <p>"Fate," said Tallis. "Something switches you abroad before you know where
  you are. I've always started unwillingly, but there has never been any
  alternative if I wanted to get a thing done."</p>

  <p>Reggie shook his head, implying that he would prefer the thing to remain
  undone.</p>

  <p>He was in this mood of comfort, sentimentality and complacency when Verona
  Cortal came to dine. Tallis was apologetic. "The Reeces at Bryncoch have a
  niece staying with them&mdash;she comes every year for a week or two's
  hunting&mdash;and I always give Jim Jack a hand to entertain her. She's
  rather a pleasant child, and deserves something nearer her age than an old
  buffer like me. I hope you don't mind. She's pretty knowledgeable about
  books, you know&mdash;been to college and that sort of thing." So the
  following evening Reggie found himself seated at dinner next to an attractive
  young woman with whom he had no difficulty in conversing. Miss Cortal was of
  the marmoreal blonde type, with a smooth white skin and a wealth of
  unshingled fair hair. Her eyes were blue, not the pale lymphatic kind, but a
  vivacious masterful blue. She was beautifully turned out, polished to a high
  degree, and to the last degree composed and confident. Reggie did not think
  her pretty; she was a trifle too substantial for one who was still under the
  spell of Pamela Brune's woodland grace; but he found her an entrancing
  companion.</p>

  <p>For she seemed to share his every taste and prejudice. They talked of the
  countryside, for which she had a lively enthusiasm. Her own home was in
  Gloucestershire, to which her people had moved from the West Riding, where
  they had been local bankers till they amalgamated with one of the London
  banks. Her father was dead, but her brothers were in business in London, and
  she lived partly with them and partly with her mother in the country. Reggie
  had never met anyone, certainly no woman, who seemed to savour so
  intelligently the manifold delights of English life, as he understood them.
  Pamela had been blank and derisory when he tried to talk of such things, but
  this girl seemed instinctively to penetrate his moods and to give his
  imponderables a clean-cut reality. It was flattering to be so fully
  comprehended. They talked of books, and it appeared that she had taken a
  degree in history at Oxford, and was making a study of the Roman remains in
  Cotswold. They discovered that they had friends in common, about whose merits
  and demerits they agreed; and presently in a corner of the shabby
  drawing-room, while her aunt dozed and Jim Jack and Tallis were deep in
  hounds, they advanced to the intimacy which comes to those who unexpectedly
  find themselves at one in their private prepossessions. Reggie saw the
  Bryncoch car depart with the conviction that he had never before met quite so
  companionable a being.</p>

  <p>It only needed some little thing to set Verona in a romantic light, and
  that something befell next day. The soft grey weather broke up into one of
  those clear, late-winter afternoons which are a foretaste of spring. The
  hounds, after various false starts in the morning, had run right to the top
  of the moorlands, and killed near the standing stones called the Three
  Brothers. Verona's mare got an overreach in a bog, and she and Reggie were
  left behind to make their way home alone in the gathering dusk. The girl
  looked well on horseback, and the excitement of the day and the winds of the
  moor had given her a wild-rose colour and abated the trimness of her get-up.
  As they jogged home Reggie wondered that he had not thought her pretty
  before; the polished young lady had gone, and in its place was something very
  girlish and young, something more primitive and more feminine. They rode
  slowly under a sky of lemon and amethyst, and stopped to watch the sunset
  flaming over the remote western hills, or to look east to where the shadows
  were creeping over the great hollow which was England. Then they descended by
  green drove-roads to the valley woods, and saw the lights' twinkle, miles
  apart, of their respective homes. It was dark now, and Reggie had to help
  with the limping mare in some of the dingles. On one such occasion she laid a
  light hand on his arm.</p>

  <p>"What a day!" she said, in a rapt whisper. "This is what I love
  best&mdash;to come out of the wilds into ancient, habitable peace. You can
  only do it in England. What a land! Who was it called it 'Merlin's Isle of
  Gramarye'?"</p>

  <p>"What a girl!" thought Reggie. "She knows what I want to think before I
  have thought it."</p>

  <p>Two days later he went to Bryncoch to luncheon. Verona was delightful. At
  Libanus she had been the accomplished woman of the world; on the moors she
  had been touched with romance; but here she was a child, eager to show her
  playthings to another child. She dragged him through the library, and out of
  a wilderness of forestry journals and reports of agricultural societies
  unearthed volumes worthy of a bibliophile's eye. She acted showman to the
  architectural curiosities of the house, and after luncheon led him to the
  old-fashioned walled garden. "They used to be able," she told him, "to grow
  all kinds of hothouse fruits here out of doors. Do you know why?" She pointed
  out the flues which ran from a furnace at each corner through the immense
  brick walls. "That is how they beat the frost and the east winds. They kept
  the walls all winter at an even temperature. They could do it a hundred years
  ago, when coal cost little more than the price of carting it from the
  pit-heads over the hills."</p>

  <p>"I love all these relics," she said with the prettiest sentiment. "I want
  the memory of them to survive. We should keep the past next door to us in our
  lives and be always looking back to it."</p>

  <p>Reggie warmly approved, for it was his own philosophy. But he was a little
  surprised when she embarked on a most businesslike discussion as to the price
  of coal, and what it would cost to do the same thing today. She quoted
  figures like an accountant. He was spurred to tell her of his own work, of
  his book-selling schemes, the successes he had had and his plans for the
  future. She listened eagerly and made what seemed to him some acute
  suggestions.</p>

  <p>He went back to London next day with his mind in a pleasant confusion. He
  did not think that he was in love with Miss Cortal, but he decided that in
  her he had found a most congenial comrade. To have discovered someone so
  like-minded, so able to justify the faith they shared, gave him a welcome
  sense of security. Whatever was in store for him he had now a puissant
  ally.</p><br>

  <h3>IV</h3>

  <p>I do not want to give the impression that Reggie was a vapid, sentimental
  young man. He was very much the other way. He had plenty of shrewdness, and
  had all the reticences of his kind. No virginity was ever more fastidiously
  guarded than the sacred places of the English male in youth. He would perish
  sooner than confess the things nearest to his heart. If anyone had told
  Reggie in his presence that he was an artist in life, a connoisseur of
  evasive sensations, the charge would have been hotly denied. He believed
  himself to be a normal person, who rejoiced in running with the pack. I
  guessed his creed, but it was only from casual unguarded phrases and his
  manner of life, never from his own confession. He would have blushed to say
  the things which Verona was always saying. But in her mouth they delighted
  him, for she put into words what he was incapable of expressing
  himself&mdash;incapable partly from shamefacedness and partly from simple
  lack of the gift for definition. She was magnificently explicit, and carried
  it off. I have been told that, when you can adequately formulate a grief, you
  have removed half the sting of it, and I fancy that in the case of the
  pleasing emotions the same explication doubles the pleasure. That is the
  virtue of the poets, since they do for the ordinary man what he cannot do for
  himself. Verona was Reggie's bard. She gave a local habitation and a name to
  his airy nothings, and in so doing she confirmed him in his faith. He felt
  that the things he cared for were given a new stability when she became their
  most competent prophet.</p>

  <p>They had arranged to meet in London, and next week he dined at the
  Cortals' large, dull house in Eaton Square. I happened to be a guest, for my
  nephew Charles was connected with the Cortals in business, and I had been
  their counsel in a complicated House of Lords appeal. It was the first
  occasion on which I met the daughter of the house.</p>

  <p>It was a big dinner-party, representative of the family's many interests,
  starred with celebrities, none of whom were quite of the first order, except
  Geraldine, the Tory leader. There was a corps commander in the late War, who
  had taken up politics and hankered after a British variant of Fascism; Lord
  Lavan, who had governed some Dominion; a Royal Academician, who painted
  mystical topical allegories, a sort of blend of Blake and Frith; a director
  of the Bank of England; Smithers, the Cambridge economist; one or two city
  magnates; Claypole, the buxom novelist, whom his admirers regarded as an
  English Balzac; a Cotswold master of hounds up in London to visit his
  dentist; nothing young except Reggie.</p>

  <p>The dinner was the elaborate affair which used to be in fashion when I
  first came to London&mdash;two dishes in every course, and the old-fashioned
  succession of wines instead of the monotonous champagne of today. Mrs Cortal
  sat beaming at her end of the table, with the blank amiability of the stone
  deaf, and the duties of hostess fell upon her daughter. I did not then
  realise her power over Reggie, but I watched her with admiration. She sat
  between Geraldine and Claypole, and she kept a big section of the table
  going. Her manner was a gentle alertness, quick to catch the ball of talk and
  return it, but never for one moment asserting itself. She had a pleasant
  trick of turning to a speaker with bright eyes and slightly raised brows, a
  trick which was an invitation to confidences. Being opposite her, I had a
  chance on such occasions of observing her face in profile, and it struck me
  that when she grew older she would have a look of Queen Victoria&mdash;the
  same ripeness and authority. Her performance was extraordinarily efficient,
  for she managed to make her neighbours talk as freely as if it had been a
  tête-à-tête, and at the same time broadcast the results to a considerable
  part of the company. Claypole's bubbling utterances were clarified by her
  into good conversation, and used as baits to entice Geraldine. The novelist's
  pose was that of a detached observer of life, a kindly and half-contemptuous
  critic of the ordinary struggle for success, whereas Geraldine was frankly an
  adept at the game, who made no concealment of his devotion to it. Claypole's
  mild cynicism, as interpreted by Verona, was just the thing to rouse the
  latter, who was adroitly led into spirited confessions of faith. There is no
  talker to compare with Geraldine when he is stirred, with his Irish humour,
  his dazzling overstatements, and his occasional flights into serious passion,
  and I have rarely heard him better than under Verona's stimulus. Claypole was
  flattered, for he was not in the habit of consorting with ex-Prime Ministers;
  the others were flattered, for they seemed to be privileged to share a great
  man's confidences. I saw Reggie's eyes fixed on the girl in respectful
  wonder.</p>

  <p>When the women rose I had a talk with one of her brothers. There were two
  of them, very much alike except that one was fair and one was dark; both were
  clean shaven, and both wore eyeglasses. One was a director of the bank which
  had absorbed the family business, and the other was a partner in a well-known
  financial house. It was the latter who took the chair beside me, and
  presently I found myself able to place the Cortal family. The brothers
  belonged to the type which in my irreverent youth we called the "blood
  stockbroker"&mdash;the people who wanted to be gentlefolk first and city men
  afterwards, but were determined to be a complete success in both rôles. They
  had been to the best public school and the most fashionable college, and had
  acquired a manner blended of the guardsman, the country squire and the man of
  affairs. Young Mr Michael talked hunting to me and the prospects of the
  National, touched upon spring salmon and his last year's experience in
  Scotland, and told an excellent story which he had heard that afternoon in
  White's; but he also said some shrewd things about politics, and when I asked
  him a question about certain rumours in the City I got a crisp and
  well-informed reply. The Cortals were assuredly a competent family, though I
  decided that there was most quality in the girl. There had been something
  Napoleonic in that graceful profile which I had studied during dinner.</p>

  <p>Afterwards in the drawing-room I saw Verona and Reggie in a corner. They
  were smiling on each other like old friends, and she was saying something to
  him with an affectionate, almost maternal air. I had decided that she would
  make an excellent wife for an ambitious politician, but now I began to wonder
  if she were not the wife for Reggie. Far more suitable than Pamela Brune,
  whose rarity and subtlety required a different kind of mate. Reggie needed
  somebody to form him and run him, somebody who would put order into the
  attractive chaos of his life. Those firm white hands of hers might do much
  with such plastic stuff.</p>

  <p>That dinner was followed by many meetings between the two. Verona dined
  with him in his little house, they went to the play together, she mounted him
  with her own pack, the Myvern, and they had several days with the Bicester.
  The first dinner in Eaton Square was soon succeeded by another, this time a
  family party&mdash;the four Cortals, a maiden aunt, a married uncle and
  several cousins. Reggie was the only stranger, and he was there as an adopted
  member of the clan, Verona's chosen friend. Not a suitor but a friend. There
  was as yet no suggestion of love-making. It was one of these newfangled,
  cold-blooded companionships between the sexes.</p>

  <p>But at this dinner it was apparent that the Cortal family had taken up
  Reggie seriously. He had already expounded his bookselling ambitions to
  Verona, as the kind of activity which made an appropriate background for the
  life he desired, and she had approved. Now it appeared that the whole family
  knew of it, and were acutely interested. There was a good opportunity, said
  the uncle&mdash;his name was Shenstone, and he was a member of a shipping
  firm which had done well during the War&mdash;for men like Reggie, who had
  the entry to many corners of English society, to establish himself as an
  honest broker between those who had, and wished to sell, and those who had
  not, and wished to buy. At present, he said, both sides went to the big
  dealers, and there was no human touch, but the human touch was needed in what
  should be more than a matter of cold business.</p>

  <p>"Take pictures," said Mr Shenstone, who was a connoisseur. "I see very
  little fun in picking up what I want at a big sale at Christie's. What I like
  is to run something to earth in some odd corner of England, and get it by
  friendly negotiation. When I look at it on my walls, I remember the story
  behind it as well as its artistic merits. It stands for an episode in my
  life, like a stag's head which recalls a good stalk. I must say I am always
  grateful to anyone who puts me in the way of this sporting interest in
  collecting."</p>

  <p>The others agreed. Mr Algernon, the elder brother, expanded the theme.
  "Reggie," he declared (they had very soon got on to Christian name terms),
  "can be the link between supply and demand, and a benefactor to both sides.
  He might be a sort of English Rosenbach. In every shire there are families
  who just manage to keep going. They have family possessions which they are
  far too proud to send to a sale, except in the very last resort. But very
  often they would gladly sell a picture or a book privately, if they knew how
  to do it, and such a sale might make all the difference to their
  comfort."</p>

  <p>The maiden aunt assented, and told how a family of her acquaintance in
  Shropshire had been saved from penury by a discovery in a garret, through the
  medium of a visiting Cambridge don, of three Shakespeare quartos. One of the
  cousins recounted a similar event in Westmorland.</p>

  <p>"Money is tight, no doubt," continued Mr Algernon, "but there's more of it
  about than people imagine. Fortunes are made on a falling as well as on a
  rising market. And people who have it do not know how to invest it.
  Industrials are too precarious, Government stocks have lost caste, and, since
  every part of the globe is under the weather, there is not the old attraction
  about foreign securities. I believe that there will be a growing tendency for
  people who have an ample margin of income to do what the Germans did when the
  mark was tumbling, and buy objects of art. But it must be something which is
  going to increase in value. Now, the fashion in pictures fluctuates, but not
  in books. There are only, say, twenty copies of an old book known to exist,
  and the numbers cannot be added to. An association book&mdash; say one which
  Walter Scott presented to Wordsworth with an autograph inscription&mdash;can
  never be duplicated. These things are better than bank-notes&mdash;they are
  solid bullion. The Americans have recognised this. A new millionaire in the
  States, as soon as he has made his pile, starts to found a library, though he
  may be scarcely literate. He knows what is certain to appreciate. He
  remembers the Huth and the Britwell sales."</p>

  <p>"And think of the charm of the business!" said Verona. "You are dealing in
  spiritual as well as in commercial values. And the cleanness of it!"</p>

  <p>"But it needs careful handling," said Mr Shenstone. "You cannot depend
  upon yourself, Mr Daker. You must get a staff together, and lay down your
  lines carefully, for what you want is an intelligence department and a
  scientifically arranged clearinghouse. You have to organise the buying side,
  and know just where to lay your hands on what you want. And you have to
  organise your customers&mdash;to get into touch with the people on both sides
  of the Atlantic who are hungering for your services. Your watchword must be
  organisation."</p>

  <p>"Rationalisation," said Mr Michael with a pleasant smile. "You must be in
  the fashion, my dear Reggie."</p>

  <p>Reggie was flattered that his ideas should be taken so seriously by such a
  company, for he had the reverence for the businessman which is often an
  obsession with the unbusinesslike. He was excited, too. He saw himself
  becoming a figure, a power, a man of wealth, all that he had ruled out as
  beyond his compass&mdash;and this without sacrifice of the things he loved
  ... But, as he caught Verona's beaming eyes, he had far down in his heart a
  little spasm of fear. For he seemed to see in them a hint of fetters.</p><br>

  <h3>V</h3>

  <p>The transformation of Reggie into a businessman was begun at once, and it
  was Verona who took charge of it. Politics at the moment were exciting, and
  in order to attend critical divisions I had to dine more than I liked at the
  House. The result was a number of improvised dinner-parties there, and at one
  of them I found Verona. No doubt Reggie had talked to her about me, so she
  treated me as if I were his elder brother. I thought her attractive, but I am
  bound to say a little formidable also, for I have rarely met any woman who
  knew her own mind so clearly.</p>

  <p>The first thing to do was to get Reggie to organise his life. "You cannot
  achieve anything," she said sagely, "unless you make a plan." It was idle to
  think of running a business from the house in Brompton, so she had induced
  him to take an office&mdash;a pleasant little set of rooms which were
  fortunately vacant in the Adelphi neighbourhood. She had got him a secretary,
  a girl who had been at college with her, and she had started a system of card
  indexes, on which she dwelt lovingly. There was one for books, another for
  possible buyers, and a third for his acquaintances. She made a great point
  about codifying, so to speak, Reggie's immense acquaintance, for it was his
  chief asset in the business. Properly managed, it should give him access to
  quarters into which no dealer could penetrate. She nodded her head, and
  emphasised her points by tapping her right-hand fingers on her left-hand
  palm, exactly like a pretty schoolmistress. And several times she said "we,"
  not "he," when she mentioned the undertaking.</p>

  <p>She thought that he had better limit its scope. Incunabula and missals and
  such-like might be put aside as too ambitious. He should specialise on his
  old love, the seventeenth century, with excursions into the eighteenth and
  early nineteenth. There was already a vigorous interest in the Augustans, and
  she predicted a revival in the post-Romantics and the Victorians. Above all,
  he should specialise in "association books" and manuscripts, which were the
  kind of thing to which he was likely to have access. More was needed than an
  intelligence bureau: they wanted a research department to verify provenances.
  There would have to be a good deal of work in the Museum, and for this she
  could enrol several young women who had been with her at Oxford. She was
  compiling a list of experts in special branches, university dons and so
  forth, to whom they could turn in special cases for advice... Also they must
  make friends with the dealers, for it was no use antagonising the
  professionals; they could work in with them up to a point, and put little
  things in their way. Reggie knew a good many, and they were having some
  carefully selected luncheon-parties to extend his acquaintance. As for
  buyers, her brothers could help, for, being in the City, they knew where
  money was. Especially with America, she thought; both Algernon and Michael
  had a great deal of American business passing through their hands, and were
  frequently in New York. The American rich, she said, were an easier
  proposition than the English, for they talked freely of their hobbies instead
  of hiding them away like a secret vice.</p>

  <p>I confess that I was enormously impressed by the girl's precision and good
  sense, and I was still more impressed when a few days later I ran across
  Reggie in the Athenæum, a club which he had taken to frequenting. She had
  made a new man of him, a man with a purpose, tightened up and endowed with a
  high velocity. His eagerness had always been his chief charm, but now,
  instead of being diffused through the atmosphere, it seemed to have been
  canalised and given direction. "I'm one of the world's workers," he
  announced. "Office hours ten to five, and longer if required. I hop about the
  country too, like a bagman. I never knew that a steady grind was such
  fun."</p>

  <p>"How is your colleague?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Marvellous!" It was his favourite adjective. "By Jove, what a head she
  has! Already she has forgotten more about my job than I ever knew!"</p>

  <p>"What do you call yourself?"</p>

  <p>"Ah, that's a puzzler. We must have a little private company, of course.
  We rather thought of 'The Interpreter's House.' Bunyan, you know. You see the
  idea&mdash;the place where things are explained to people and people are
  explained to themselves. It was Verona's notion. Jolly good, I think."</p>

  <p>It seemed an ambitious name for a dealer in old books, but it was not for
  me to damp Reggie's ardour. I could only rejoice that someone had managed to
  break him to harness, a task in which his friends had hitherto conspicuously
  failed. I met him occasionally in the company of the Cortal brothers, and I
  fancied that these glossy young men had something of the air of
  horsebreakers. They peered at the world through their glasses with a friendly
  proprietary air, and clearly regarded Reggie as their property. I was never
  quite at ease in their presence, for their efficiency was a little too naked;
  they were too manifestly well equipped, too elaborately men of the world. But
  Reggie was fascinated. He, whose clothes had never been his strong point, was
  now trim and natty, and wore, like them, the ordinary City regimentals.</p>

  <p>I asked my nephew Charles what he thought of the brothers, and he laughed.
  "The shiny Cortals!" he replied. "Good enough chaps in their way, I believe.
  Quite a high reputation in their own line. Can't say I care much for them
  myself. Their minds are too dashed relevant, if you know what I mean. No
  margin to them&mdash;no jolly waste&mdash;everything tidied up and put to its
  best use. I should think more of them if now and then they condescended to
  make a bloomer. Their gentility is a little too self-conscious, too. Oh, and
  of course they haven't a scrap of humour&mdash;not what you and I would call
  humour."</p>

  <p>One night I dined with one of the livery companies, and sat next to the
  uncle, Shenstone, who was prime warden. Under the influence of some wonderful
  Madeira he became talkative, and I realised that the harness laid upon
  Reggie's back was going to be something more than a business set. For
  Shenstone spoke of him as if he were a member of the family, with just that
  touch of affectionate candour with which one speaks of a promising but still
  problematical relative. "Dear old Reggie," said the uncle. "Best of good
  fellows and full of stuff, you know. Slackly brought up, and needs to learn
  business habits, but improving every day." I forbore to mention Verona's
  name, for I feared confidences. But I understood that Reggie was no more the
  unattached spectator of life; he had been gathered into the fold of a tightly
  knit and most competent clan.</p>

  <p>Just before I went abroad for Easter I dined again in Verona's company,
  and had the privilege of a long and intimate talk. I learned why the name of
  "Interpreter's House" had been selected. Verona had visions which soared far
  beyond the brokerage of old books. She wanted to make the firm a purveyor of
  English traditions, a discreet merchant of English charm. It would guide
  strangers of leisure into paths where they could savour fully the magic of an
  ancient society. It would provide seekers with a background which, unless
  they were born to it, they could never find. It would be a clearing-house for
  delicate and subtle and indefinable things. It would reveal and interpret the
  sacred places of our long history. In a word, it would "rationalise" and make
  available to the public the antique glamour of these islands.</p>

  <p>It all sounds preposterous, but there was nothing preposterous about her
  exposition. She had a trick, when excited, of half-closing her lids, which
  softened the rather hard vitality of her eyes, and at such times she lost her
  usual briskness and was almost wistful. "YOU MUST understand what I mean. We
  are all agreed that England is Merlin's Isle of Gramarye." (I quote her exact
  words.) "But to how many is that more than a phrase? It is so hard to get
  behind the veil of our noisy modernism to the lovely and enduring truth. You
  know how sensitive Reggie is to such things. Well, we want to help people who
  are less fortunate. Strangers come to London&mdash;from the
  provinces&mdash;from America&mdash;steeped in London's romance which they
  have got from books. But the reality is a terrible anticlimax. They need to
  be helped if they are to recapture the other Londons which are still there
  layer on layer, the Londons of Chaucer and the Elizabethans, and Milton and
  Dr Johnson and Charles Lamb and Dickens... And Oxford... and Edinburgh... and
  Bath... and the English country. We want to get past the garages and petrol
  pumps and county council cottages to the ancient rustic England which can
  never die."</p>

  <p>"I see. Glamour off the peg. You will charge a price for it, of
  course?"</p>

  <p>She looked at me gravely and reprovingly, and her lids opened to reveal
  agate eyes.</p>

  <p>"We shall charge a price," she said. "But moneymaking will not be our
  first object."</p>

  <p>I had offended her by my coarse phrase, and I got no more confidences that
  evening. It was plain that Reggie was being equipped with several kinds of
  harness; his day was mapped out, he was inspanned in a family team, and now
  his vagrant fancies were to be regimented. I thought a good deal about him on
  my holiday, while I explored the spring flowers of the Jura. One of my
  reflections, I remember, was that Moe's moment of prevision had failed badly
  so far as he was concerned. Reggie was not likely to undertake any foreign
  adventure, having anchored himself by so many chains to English soil.</p><br>

  <h3>VI</h3>

  <p>Some time in May I began to have my doubts about the success of the
  partnership.</p>

  <p>May is the pleasantest of months for a London dweller. Wafts of spring are
  blown in from its green cincture, the parks are at their gayest, there is
  freshness in the air, and the colours, the delicate half-shades of the most
  beautiful city on earth, take on a new purity. Along with late October, May
  had always been Reggie's favourite season. First there would be the early
  canter in the Park. Then a leisurely breakfast, the newspaper, and his first
  pipe, with the morning sun making delectable patterns on the bookshelves. He
  would write a few letters and walk eastward, dwelling lovingly on the sights
  and the sounds&mdash;the flower-girls, the shoppers, the bustle of the main
  streets, the sudden peace of the little squares with their white stucco and
  green turf and purple lilacs and pink hawthorns. Luncheon at one of his clubs
  would follow, or perhaps an agreeable meal at a friend's house. In the
  afternoon he had many little tasks&mdash; visits to the Museum, the sales or
  the picture galleries, researches in bookshops, excursions into queer corners
  of the City. He liked to have tea at home, and would spend the hours before
  dinner over books, for he was a discriminating but voracious reader. Then
  would come dinner; with a group of young men at a club or restaurant; or at
  some ceremonial feast, where he enjoyed the experience of meeting new people
  and making friendly explorations; or best of all at home, where he read till
  bedtime.</p>

  <p>He had his exercise, too. He played a little polo at Roehampton and a good
  deal of tennis. He was an ardent fisherman, and usually spent the weekends on
  a Berkshire trout stream, where he had a rod. He would have a delightful
  Friday evening looking out tackle, and would be off at cockrow on Saturday in
  his little car, returning late on the Sunday night with a sunburnt face and
  an added zest for life... I always felt that, for an idle man, Reggie made a
  very successful business of his days, and sometimes I found it in my heart to
  envy him.</p>

  <p>But now all this had changed. I had a feverish time myself that May with
  the General Election, which did not, of course, concern Reggie. When I got
  back to Town and the turmoil was over, I ran across him one afternoon in the
  Strand, and observed a change in him. His usual wholesome complexion had
  gone; he looked tired and white and harassed&mdash;notably harassed. But he
  appeared to be in good spirits. "Busy!" he cried. "I should think I was. I
  never get a moment to myself. I haven't had a rod in my hand this
  year&mdash;haven't been out of London except on duty. You see, we're at the
  most critical stage&mdash;laying down our lines&mdash;got to get them right,
  for everything depends on them. Oh yes, thanks. We're doing famously for
  beginners. If only the American slump would mend... "</p>

  <p>I enquired about Miss Cortal, as I was bound to do. No engagement had been
  announced, but such a relationship could only end in marriage. People had
  long ago made that assumption.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Verona's very well. A bit overworked like me." There was an odd look
  in his eyes, and something new in his voice&mdash; not the frank admiration
  and friendliness of the pre-Easter period&mdash;something which was almost
  embarrassment. I set it down to the shyness of a man in first love.</p>

  <p>I asked him to dine, but he couldn't&mdash;was full up for weeks ahead. He
  consulted a little book, and announced his engagements. They all seemed to be
  with members of the Cortal family. Luncheon was the same. On my only free
  days he was booked to Shenstone, the maiden aunt, and cousins from Norfolk
  who had taken a house in Town. He left me with the same hustled, preoccupied
  face... Next day I saw him on the Embankment walking home with the Cortal
  brothers. They were smiling and talking, but somehow he had the air of a man
  taking exercise between two genial warders.</p>

  <p>I spoke to my cynical nephew about it. "The Shinies!" Charles exclaimed.
  "Not the Sheenies&mdash;there's nothing Jewish about Cortal Frères. When will
  the world realise that we produce in England something much tougher than any
  Hebrew? We call them the Shinies, because of their high varnish... Old Reggie
  is corralled all right, shoes off, feet fired and the paddock gates
  bolted!... Will he marry the girl? I should jolly well think so. He's
  probably up to his ears in love with her, but even if he loathed her name he
  would have to go through with it... And he'll espouse a dashed lot more than
  the buxom Miss Verona&mdash;all her uncles and her nephews and her cousins
  and her aunts for ever and ever. They say that when a man marries a Jewess he
  finds himself half-smothered under a great feather-bed of steamy
  consanguinity. Well, it will be the same with the Cortals, only the clan will
  be less sticky. Reggie will never again call his soul his own. I'm not sure
  that he'll want to, but anyhow he won't. They'll never let him alone. He used
  to be rather a solitary bird, but now he'll have his fill of relations, all
  as active as fleas. What does the Bible say? 'He shall receive an hundredfold
  houses, and brethren, and sisters, and mothers&mdash;with persecutions... '
  With persecutions, mark you. Reggie is for it all right."</p>

  <p>As it happened I was so busy with arrears of cases that my life was
  cloistered during the last week of May and the first of June, and I thought
  no more of Reggie's fortunes. But on the seventh day of June I had a letter
  from him, enclosing the proof of a kind of prospectus and asking me what I
  thought of it.</p>

  <p>I thought many things about it. It was a statement of the aims of the
  "Interpreter's House," which was to be circulated to a carefully selected
  list in England and America. In every sentence it bore the mark of Verona's
  fine Roman hand. No man could have written it. There was an indecency about
  its candour and its flat-footed clarity from which the most pachydermatous
  male would have recoiled.</p>

  <p>In its way it was horribly well done. It was a kind of Stores List of the
  varieties of English charm and the easiest way to get hold of them. Merlin's
  Isle of Gramarye had at last got its auctioneer's catalogue. Not that it was
  written in the style of an estate-agent. It was uncommonly well written, full
  of good phrases and apposite quotations, and it carried a fine bookish
  flavour. But ye gods! it was terrible. Relentlessly it set down in black and
  white all the delicate, half-formed sentiments we cherish in our innermost
  hearts, and dare not talk about. It was so cursedly explicit that it brushed
  the bloom off whatever it touched. A June twilight became the glare of an arc
  lamp, the greenery of April the arsenical green of a chemist's shop. Evasive
  dreams were transformed into mercantile dogmas. It was a kind of simony, a
  trafficking in sacred things. The magic of England was "rationalised" with a
  vengeance... There could be no doubt about its effectiveness. I could see the
  shoddy culture of two continents seizing upon it joyously as a final
  statement of the "English proposition." It was a magnificent commercial
  prospectus for the "Interpreter's House." But I wondered how Reggie felt
  about it&mdash;Reggie who had always had a maidenly shyness about his inner
  world.</p>

  <p>It seemed to me that the time had come for a heart-to-heart talk with him.
  I resolved to be very careful, for I was dealing with perilous stuff. If he
  was in love with Verona I dared not speak my mind, and even if there was no
  love, there were deep obligations of gratitude.</p>

  <p>He dined with me at the House on the evening of June eighth, and
  afterwards we talked in a corner of the terrace. His looks made me uneasy,
  for he seemed both listless and restless. He kept looking nervously about
  him, as if at any moment something hostile might attack him. He had the air
  of a smallish rabbit caught in a largish trap.</p>

  <p>But it was a stoical rabbit, for to me he made no complaint. In a leaden
  voice he announced that he was the most fortunate of men. His business was
  flourishing, and in the autumn it was proposed to form a company... At last
  he had found a vocation in life. Yet there was as much conviction in his
  voice as in the babbling of a sleep-walker.</p>

  <p>I asked him baldly when he was going to be married. In even tones he
  replied that nothing had as yet been settled. But the form of his answer
  implied that something would soon be settled. I forbore to enquire further,
  for his gaze was fixed glassily on the tower of Lambeth Palace.</p>

  <p>Then of his own accord he asked me what I had thought of the prospectus. I
  hastily resolved that no good could come of candour. Reggie had made his bed
  and meant to lie on it, and it was not for me to put in extra thorns.</p>

  <p>"Very well done," I said; "what the Germans call appetitlich. It should
  give you an excellent send-off."</p>

  <p>"You didn't think it vulgar?"</p>

  <p>"Not a bit," I lied. "Half-tones and broken lights won't do in business.
  You must be emphatic."</p>

  <p>He nodded. "I agree with you. She wrote it, you know. Michael revised it,
  but in substance it was her work."</p>

  <p>I said something silly about having detected the finer female touch. Then
  he rose to go&mdash;he had an appointment with an American at the Savoy. It
  had been the most hopeless evening, for I had never come near him. He seemed
  to be separated from me by a vast thicket, and I felt that if I laid an axe
  to the bushes they would scream like mandrakes.</p>

  <p>When we said good-bye, I felt a sudden wave of liking and pity. I patted
  him on the shoulder. "I hope you're going to be very happy, old man," I said,
  but he made no answer.</p>

  <p>As I went back to my rooms I suddenly thought with grim amusement of what
  had happened at Flambard a year before. That story, so far as Reggie was
  concerned, was over. Youth's infinite choice of roads had given place to a
  rigid groove, presided over by a relentless marmoreal blonde.</p><br>

  <h3>VII</h3>

  <p>But I was wrong. It may have been merely the sight of me as part of his
  old life, or it may have been my last words, but something that night brought
  Reggie to breaking-point. When he got home he rang up Tallis at Libanus,
  found that he was in London, ran him to ground at the Travellers', and
  arranged to meet him the following morning. I do not know why he turned to
  Tallis, except that it was at his house that he had first met Verona, and
  that he seemed to stand for him on the dividing-line between a world which he
  had loved and a world which he had come to hate and fear.</p>

  <p>Tallis told me this part of the story. They lunched together, and talked
  afterwards beside the fireplace in the hall. He had not seen Reggie for
  nearly six months, and was shocked at the change in him. As he expressed it,
  Reggie's coat was all sulky and his body like a cab-horse.</p>

  <p>According to Tallis, Reggie plunged at once into his tale, telling it with
  a kind of angry vehemence, rather dim about details, but desperately clear on
  the main points. He had lost everything he cared for in life, he said; he was
  involved in a juggernaut of a business, ground under a juggernaut of a
  family, and about to be tied up for life to a juggernaut of a girl. This last
  he only implied, for he spoke no disrespectful word of Verona.</p>

  <p>"You haven't proposed to her?" Tallis asked.</p>

  <p>Reggie said he hadn't, but that everybody expected him to, including, he
  feared, the lady herself. There was to be a Cortal family dinner the
  following night, and it had been gently but firmly hinted to him that that
  would be a fitting moment to announce the engagement.</p>

  <p>"I gather that you're not in love with her?" said Tallis.</p>

  <p>Reggie looked wooden. He was trying to live up to his code. "I admire her
  immensely," he stammered. "And I'm grateful to her&mdash;far more grateful
  than I can ever express&mdash;I owe her a tremendous lot... She has worked
  like a slave for me&mdash;given up most of her time&mdash;oh, she's a marvel!
  Unselfish, too... Nobody has ever taken such an interest in me... "</p>

  <p>"I know, I know. But do you love her?"</p>

  <p>Then, just as an ice jam cracks on a river, Reggie's decorum went with a
  rush.</p>

  <p>"No, by God," he cried wildly. "I don't love her! And she doesn't love me.
  She has taken me up, and she'll stick to me till I'm in my grave, but she
  doesn't love me. She couldn't love anybody&mdash;not made that way. I'm only
  her business partner, the thing she needed to round off her life... Love her!
  O Lord, I'm nearer hating her. I'm in terror of her. She mesmerises me, like
  a stoat with a rabbit. She has twenty times my brains, and I've simply got to
  do as I'm told... And then there's her awful family. I'm lapped in them,
  suffocated by them. I loathe her infernal apes of brothers&mdash;they're so
  cursed gentlemanlike and efficient and patronising. Dash it all, man, there
  are times when I can scarcely keep from hitting their blinking faces."</p>

  <p>He dragged a paper from his pocket, and flung it at Tallis.</p>

  <p>"There's worse still. Look at that. Read it carefully and smack your lips
  over its succulent beastliness. That's the Cortal idea of what I'm going to
  give my life to. That's the prospectus of my business. The 'Interpreter's
  House,' by God! It has interpreted them to me all right. Do you grasp the
  perfect hell of it? I'm to spend my days with the things I thought I cared
  about, but the gloss is rubbed off every one of them. I'm to be a sort of
  Cook's guide to culture on a sound commercial basis. Damn it, I'd rather
  clean out drains in Chicago, for then I should know that there was a jolly
  world to which I might some day return. But it's just that jolly world that's
  been blasted for me."</p>

  <p>He dropped his head on his hands and groaned.</p>

  <p>"There's no way out except to cut my throat, and that wouldn't be playing
  the game. I suppose I must go through with it. I mustn't behave like a cad
  ... Besides, I daren't. I simply haven't the nerve."</p>

  <p>Tallis was smiling cryptically.</p>

  <p>"Funny you should tell me this. For the same thing happened to me about a
  quarter of a century ago."</p>

  <p>Reggie looked up quickly. "Gospel truth?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Gospel truth. She was an American&mdash;from Philadelphia&mdash;very
  pretty, and sweet, and sticky as barley sugar. She had a family, too, just
  like the Cortals, and she had a business mind. She took me up, and meant to
  run me, and at first I was fascinated. Then I saw that it would mean
  Gehenna&mdash;Gehenna for both of us."</p>

  <p>"What did you do?" The question came like a pistol crack.</p>

  <p>"I did the only thing. Ran away and hid myself. Very far away&mdash;to
  western Tibet. I thought at the time that I was behaving like a cad, but now
  I know that it would have been far more caddish to have gone on. Marriage by
  capture doesn't suit people like you and me."</p>

  <p>Reggie stared.</p>

  <p>"I am not going to Tibet," he said. He had forgotten all about Moe and
  Flambard, but something remained by way of an inhibition against the
  Orient.</p>

  <p>"No need to. The world is wide. There's plenty of other places."</p>

  <p>Tallis rose and rang a bell.</p>

  <p>"I'm an abstemious man," he said; "but I always drink brandy in moments of
  crisis. This is a crisis for you, my lad, and I'm going to take charge of it.
  You must run away and hide, like a little boy. It's the only thing to do, and
  it's also the wisest and the most courageous thing. Cut the painter, burn the
  ship, hew down the bridge behind you."</p>

  <p>There was light in Reggie's dull eyes.</p>

  <p>"Where shall I run to?" he asked, and his voice had lost its flatness.</p>

  <p>"Come with me," said Tallis. "I'm off tomorrow morning, and shall be away
  for the better part of a year. I have a bit of work to do before I can finish
  my book. I have shut up Libanus and sent my valuables to the bank. We go up
  to Liverpool tonight, so you will just have time to make your
  arrangements."</p>

  <p>"I'm not going east," said Reggie, as the vague recollection rose again in
  him.</p>

  <p>"No more am I. I am going west."</p>

  <p>Tallis fetched a sheet of club notepaper on which he wrote with a fat gold
  pencil.</p>

  <p>"We must proceed according to Cocker," he said. "No secret shuffling out
  of the country. This is an announcement of my departure which will appear in
  the press tomorrow, and I have added your name. It is your Declaration of
  Independence to all whom it may concern. Also you are going straight from
  here to see Verona and tell her. That will correspond to the tea chests in
  Boston Harbour. The train for Liverpool leaves at ten minutes past seven. We
  can dine on it."</p>

  <p>"What shall I say to her?" Reggie faltered, but not as one without
  hope.</p>

  <p>"That's your concern. You will find words if you really mean business. You
  are improving on my conduct, for I never made my adieux to the lady, but then
  Verona has done a good deal for you, and she is old Jim Jack's niece. After
  all, it's a kindness to her, for a girl with her brains can do better for
  herself than a chap like you. When you get home, you'll find that she has
  espoused some appalling magnate."</p>

  <p>Reggie was on his feet, his lassitude gone, his shoulders squared. He
  spruced himself up with the help of an adjacent mirror, and his movements
  were brisk.</p>

  <p>"Right," he said. "The seven-ten at Euston. I needn't take much luggage,
  for I can buy what I want in... " He stopped short. "New York is no good. I
  can't hide myself there. The Cortals know half the place, and those blighted
  brothers are always hopping over."</p>

  <p>Tallis was paying for the brandy.</p>

  <p>"You needn't worry about that," he said. "New York is only our jumping-off
  point. We are bound for farther south... Central America... a place called
  Yucatan."</p>

  <p class="poem">"A covert place<br>
  Where you might think to find a din<br>
  Of doubtful talk, and a live flame<br>
  Wandering, and many a shape whose name<br>
  Not itself knoweth, and old dew,<br>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p>For five months after that Whitsuntide at Flambard I saw and heard nothing
  of Goodeve. But I could not get him out of my mind, for of all the party he
  had struck me as the one to whom the experience meant the most, the one who
  had been the most tense and expectant. Whatever he had seen on the phantasmal
  Times page of a year ahead he would take with the utmost seriousness. I liked
  him so much that I was a little anxious about him. He was finer clay than the
  others.</p>

  <p>My own attitude towards Moe's experiment varied during these months.
  Sometimes I was inclined to consider the whole thing the vagary of a genius
  gone mad. But there were moments when I remembered his brooding pits of eyes
  and the strange compulsion of his talk, and came again under his spell. I
  made an opportunity to see Landor&mdash;the man I had telephoned from
  Flambard before my first conversation with Moe&mdash;and tried to discover
  what substance a trained scientist might find in Moe's general theory. But
  Landor was not very helpful. The usual reaction had begun, and I gathered
  that at the moment the dead man had more critics than followers. Landor
  declared that he did not profess to understand him, but that the common view
  was that the speculations of his last years had been a sad declension from
  his earlier achievements in physics and mathematics. "It is the old story,"
  he said. "Age means a breaking down of partition walls, and the imagination
  muddies the reason. Moe should have ended as a poet or a preacher. He had got
  a little beyond science." I tried to put limpingly Moe's theory of Time, and
  Landor wrinkled his brows. "I know that there are people working on that
  line," he said, "but I don't think they have made much of it. It's rather
  outside my beat. More psychology than physics."</p>

  <p>This conversation did little to reassure me. So far as Goodeve was
  concerned, it was not the actual validity of Moe's doctrine that mattered,
  but his own reactions to the experience. And an incident in the last week of
  October rather shook the scepticism which I had been trying to cultivate. For
  I opened the newspaper one morning to learn that young Molsom had been
  appointed a Lord of Appeal straight from the Bar, a most unexpected choice.
  Yet _I_ had expected it, for in my efforts to throw my mind a year forward
  under Moe's direction I had had a vision of the future House of Lords
  tribunal. The figure on the Woolsack had been blurred, but Molsom had been
  perfectly clear, with his big nose and his habit of folded arms.</p>

  <p>In the beginning of November Sir Thomas Twiston died, and Goodeve, the
  prospective candidate, had to face a by-election. The Marton division of
  Dorset was reckoned one of the safest Tory seats in the land, but this
  contest had not the dullness of the usual political certainty. Goodeve was
  opposed, and though the opposition was futile, the election gave an
  opportunity for some interesting propaganda. It fell just after Geraldine had
  concluded his tour in the North, where he had made a feature of unemployment
  and his new emigration policy&mdash;a policy which, as I have already
  mentioned, was strongly disliked by many of his own party. Goodeve, who had
  always been an eager Imperialist, saw his chance. He expounded his leader's
  views with equal eloquence and far greater knowledge. The press reported him
  at length, for his speeches were excellent copy; he dealt wittily and
  faithfully with both Waldemar and the Liberals and the "big business" group
  in his own party. Before the contest was over he had become a considerable
  personality in politics.</p>

  <p>In fulfilment of an old promise I went down to speak for him on the eve of
  the poll. We had three joint meetings, and I was much impressed by his
  performance. Here was a new voice and a new mind, a man who could make
  platitudes seem novelties, and convince his hearers that the most startling
  novelties were platitudes. He looked vigorous and fit, and his gusto seemed
  to dispose of my former anxieties.</p>

  <p>But at the hotel on the evening of the election day I realised that he had
  been trying himself high. His fine, dark face was too sharp for health, and
  his wholesome colour had gone. He was so tired that he could scarcely eat a
  mouthful of supper, but when I wanted him to go to bed he declared that it
  was no good, since he could not sleep. He kept me up till the small hours,
  but he did not talk much&mdash;not a word about the election and its chances.
  Next day he looked better, but I was glad when the declaration of the poll
  was over. He was in by an immense majority, nearly fourteen thousand, and
  there was the usual row in the streets and a tour of committee rooms. I had
  meant to get back to Town for luncheon, but something in his face made me
  change my plans. "Won't you spare me one night?" he begged. "Come back with
  me to Goodeve. I implore you, Leithen. You do me more good than anybody else
  on earth, and I need you to help me to recover my balance." I could not
  resist the appeal in his eyes, so I sent off a few telegrams, and in the late
  afternoon escaped with him from Marton.</p>

  <p>It was a drive of about forty miles through a misty November twilight. He
  scarcely uttered a word, and I respected his mood and also kept silence. The
  man was clearly dog-tired. His house received us with blazing fires and the
  mellow shadows of the loveliest hall in England. He went straight upstairs,
  announcing that he would have a bath and lie down till dinner.</p>

  <p>At dinner his manner was brisker. He seemed to feel the comfort of release
  from the sickening grind of an election, and I realised that the thing had
  been for him a heavy piece of collar work. Goodeve was not the man to enjoy
  the debauch of half-truths inevitable in platform speeches. I expected him to
  talk about politics, which at the time were in a considerable mess. I told
  him that he was entering Parliament at a dramatic moment with a reputation
  already made, and said the sort of encouraging things which the ordinary new
  member would have welcomed. But he did not seem much interested in the gossip
  which I retailed. When I speculated on Geraldine's next move he yawned.</p>

  <p>He was far more inclined to talk about his house. I had never stayed at
  Goodeve before, and had fallen at once under the spell of its cloudy
  magnificence. I think I used that very phrase, for such was my main
  impression. It had an air of spaciousness far greater than its actual
  dimensions warranted, for all its perspectives seemed to end in shadows, to
  fade away into a world where our measurements no longer held... When I had
  first talked with him at Flambard he had been in revolt against the dominance
  of the old house which was always trying to drag him back into the past, and
  had spoken of resisting the pull of his ancestors. Now he seemed to welcome
  it. He had been making researches in its history, and was full of curious
  knowledge about his forbears. After dinner he had the long gallery on the
  first floor lit up, and we made a tour of inspection of the family
  portraits.</p>

  <p>I was struck, I remember, by the enduring physical characteristics of his
  race. Most of his ancestors were dark men with long faces, and that odd
  delicacy about mouth and chin which one sees in the busts of Julius Caesar.
  Not a strong stock, perhaps, but a fine one. Goodeve himself, with his
  straight brows, had a more masterful air than the pictures, but when I looked
  at him again I thought I saw the same slight over-refinement, something too
  mobile in the lips, too anxious in the eyes. "Tremulous, impressional,"
  Emerson says that the hero must be, and these were the qualities of the old
  Goodeves which leaped at once from their portraits. Many had been
  heroes&mdash; notably the Sir Robert who fell at Naseby and the Sir Geoffrey
  who died with Moore at Corunna&mdash;but it was a heroism for death rather
  than for life. I wondered how the race had managed to survive so long.</p>

  <p>Oddly enough it was their deaths that seemed chiefly to interest Goodeve.
  He had all the details of them&mdash;this one had died in his bed at
  sixty-three, that in the hunting-field at forty, another in a drinking bout
  in the early twenties. They appeared for the most part to have been a
  short-lived race and tragically fated...</p>

  <p>By and by this mortuary tale began to irritate me. I preferred to think of
  the cuirassed, periwigged or cravated gentlemen, the hooped and flounced
  ladies, as in the vigour of life in which the artist had drawn them. And then
  I saw that in Goodeve's face which set me wondering. On his own account he
  was trying to puzzle out some urgent thing&mdash;urgent for himself. He was
  digging into his family history and interrogating the painted faces on his
  walls to find an answer to some vital problem of his own.</p>

  <p>What it might be I could not guess, but it disquieted me, and I lent an
  inattentive ear to his catalogue. And then I suddenly got enlightenment.</p>

  <p>We had left the gallery and were making our way to the library through a
  chain of little drawing-rooms. All had been lit up, and all were full of
  pictures, mostly Italian, collected by various Goodeves during the Grand
  Tour. They were cheerful rooms, papered not panelled, with a pleasant
  Victorian complacency about them. But in the last the walls were dark oak,
  and above the fireplace was a picture which arrested me. Goodeve seemed to
  wish to hurry me on, but when he saw my interest he too halted.</p>

  <p>It was a Spanish piece, painted I should think by someone who had come
  under El Greco's influence, and had also studied the Dutch school. I am no
  authority on art, but if it be its purpose to make an instant and profound
  impression on a beholder, then this was a masterpiece. It represented a hall
  in some great house, paved with black and white marble. There was a big fire
  burning in an antique fireplace, and the walls blazed with candles. But the
  hangings were a curious dusky crimson, so that in spite of the brilliant
  lighting the place was sombre, suggesting more a church than a dwelling. The
  upper walls and the corners were in deep shadow. On the floor some ten
  couples were dancing, an ordered dance in which there was no gaiety, and the
  dancers' faces were all set and white. Other people were sitting round the
  walls, rigidly composed as if they were curbing some strong passion. At the
  great doors at the far end men-at-arms stood on guard, so that none should
  pass. On every face, in every movement was fear&mdash;fear, and an awful
  expectation of something which was outside in the night. You felt that at any
  moment the composure might crack, that the faces would become contorted with
  terror and the air filled with shrieks.</p>

  <p>The picture was lettered "La Peste," but I did not need the words to tell
  me the subject. It was a house in a city where the plague was raging. These
  people were trying to forget the horror. They had secluded themselves in a
  palace, set guards at the door, and tried to shut out the world. But they had
  failed, for the spectre rubbed shoulders with each. They might already have
  the poison in their blood, and in an hour be blue and swollen. One heard the
  rumble of the dead-cart on the outer cobbles making a dreadful bass to the
  fiddles.</p>

  <p>I have never received a stronger impression from any picture. I think I
  must have cried out, for Goodeve came close to me.</p>

  <p>"My God, what a thing!" I said. "The man who painted that was a
  devil!"</p>

  <p>"He understood the meaning of fear," was the answer.</p>

  <p>"Not honest human fear," I said. "That is the panic of hell."</p>

  <p>Goodeve shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Only fear. Everybody there has still a hope that they may escape. They
  are still only fearful and anxious. Panic will come when the first yellow
  pustules show on the skin. For panic you must have a certainty."</p>

  <p>Something in his tone made me turn my eyes from the picture to his face.
  He had become like all his ancestors; the firm modern moulding had slackened
  into something puzzled and uncertain, as of a man groping in a dim world. And
  in his eyes and around his lips was the grey shadow of a creeping dread.</p>

  <p>My mind flew back to Flambard. I knew now that on that June morning
  Goodeve had received some fateful message. I thought I could guess what the
  message had been.</p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p>We drifted to the library, and dropped into chairs on each side of the
  hearth. It was a chilly night, so the fire had been kept high, and the room
  was so arranged that the light was concentrated around where we sat, and the
  rest left in shadow. So I had a good view of Goodeve's face against a dusky
  background. He had lit a pipe, and was staring at the logs, his whole body
  relaxed like a tired man's. But I caught him casting furtive glances in my
  direction. He wanted to tell me something; perhaps he saw that I had guessed,
  and wanted me to ask a question, but I felt oddly embarrassed and waited.</p>

  <p>He spoke first.</p>

  <p>"Moe is dead," he said simply, and I nodded.</p>

  <p>"It is a pity," he went on. "I should have liked another talk with him.
  Did you understand his theories?"</p>

  <p>I shook my head.</p>

  <p>"No more did I," he said. "I don't think I ever could. I have been reading
  Paston and Crevalli and all round the subject, but I can't get the hang of
  it. My mind hasn't been trained that way."</p>

  <p>"Nor mine," I replied. "Nor, as far as I can gather, that of anybody
  living. Moe seems to have got into a world of his own where no one could keep
  up with him."</p>

  <p>"It's a pity," he said again. "If one could have followed his reasoning
  and been able to judge for one's self its value, it would have made a
  difference... perhaps."</p>

  <p>"I ought to tell you," I said, "that I've been making enquiries, and I
  find that our best people are not inclined to take Moe as gospel."</p>

  <p>"So I gather. But I'm not sure that that helps. Even if his theories were
  all wrong, the fact would still remain that he could draw back the curtain a
  little. It may have been an illusion, of course, but we can't tell...
  yet."</p>

  <p>He stared into the fire, and then said very gently, "You see&mdash;I got a
  glimpse inside."</p>

  <p>"I know," I said.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he went on, "and I believe you have guessed what I saw."</p>

  <p>I nodded.</p>

  <p>"Let me tell you everything. It's a comfort to me to be able to tell you
  ... You're the only man I could ever confide in... You were there yourself
  and saw enough to take it seriously... I read, for about a quarter of a
  second, my own obituary. One takes in a good deal in a flash of time if the
  mind is expectant. It was a paragraph about two inches long far down on the
  right-hand side of The Times page opposite the leaders&mdash;the usual
  summary of what is given at length in the proper obituary pages. It regretted
  to announce the death of Sir Robert Goodeve, Baronet, of Goodeve, MP for the
  Marton division of Dorset. There was no doubt about the man it meant... Then
  it said something about a growing political reputation and a maiden speech
  which would not be soon forgotten. I have the exact words written down."</p>

  <p>"Nothing more?"</p>

  <p>"No... yes. There was another dead man in the paragraph, a Colonel Dugald
  Chatto, of Glasgow... That was all."</p>

  <p>Goodeve knocked out his pipe and got to his feet. He stretched himself, as
  if his legs had cramped, and I remember thinking how fine a figure of a man
  he was as he stood tensely in the firelight. He was staring away from me into
  a dim corner of the room. He seemed to be endeavouring by a bodily effort to
  shake himself free of a burden.</p>

  <p>I tried to help.</p>

  <p>"I'm in the confidence of only one of the others," I said. "Reggie Daker.
  He read the announcement of his departure for Yucatan on a scientific
  expedition. Reggie knows nothing about science and hates foreign parts, and
  he declares that nothing will make him budge from England. He says that
  forewarned is forearmed, and that he is going to see that The Times next June
  is put in the cart. He has already forgotten all about the thing... There
  seems to me to be some sense in that point of view. If you know what's coming
  you can take steps to avoid it... For example, supposing you had given up
  your parliamentary candidature, you could have made The Times wrong on that
  point, so why shouldn't you be able to make it wrong on others?"</p>

  <p>He turned and bent his strong dark brows on me.</p>

  <p>"I thought of that. I can't quite explain why, but it seemed to me
  scarcely to be playing the game. Rather like funking. No. I'm not going to
  alter my plan of life out of fear. That would be giving in like a
  coward."</p>

  <p>But there was none of the boisterousness of defiance in his voice. He
  spoke heavily, as if putting into words an inevitable but rather hopeless
  resolution.</p>

  <p>"Look here, Goodeve," I said. "You and I are rational men of the world and
  we can't allow ourselves to be the sport of whimsies. There are two ways of
  looking at this Flambard business. It may have been pure illusion caused by
  the hypnotic powers of a tremendous personality like Moe, with no substance
  of reality behind it. It may have been only a kind of dream. If you dreamed
  you were being buried in Westminster Abbey next week you wouldn't pay the
  slightest attention."</p>

  <p>"That is a possible view," he said. But I could see that it was not the
  view he took himself. Moe's influence upon him had been so profound, that,
  though he could not justify his faith on scientific grounds, he was a
  convinced believer.</p>

  <p>I had a sudden idea.</p>

  <p>"Listen to me. I can prove that it is illusion. Moe told us that our minds
  could get a larger field of observation, which would include part of the
  future. Yes, but the observing thing was still our mind, and that presupposes
  a living man. Therefore for a man to see the report of his death is a
  contradiction in terms."</p>

  <p>He turned his unquiet eyes on me.</p>

  <p>"Curious that you should say that, for I raised the very point with Moe.
  His answer was that the body of the observer might be dead, but that the mind
  did not die... I was bound to admit his argument, for, you see, I, too,
  believe in the immortality of the soul."</p>

  <p>There was such complete conviction in his tone that I had to give up my
  point, though I was not convinced, even on Goodeve's hypothesis.</p>

  <p>"Very well. The other view is that, by some unknown legerdemain, you
  actually saw what will be printed in The Times on the next tenth of June. But
  it may be a hoax or some journalistic blunder. False news of a man's death
  has often been published. You remember Billy Devereux seven years ago. Reggie
  Daker isn't going to Yucatan, and there's no more reason why you should be
  dead."</p>

  <p>He smiled, and his voice was a little more cheerful. "I would point out,"
  he said, "that there is a considerable difference between the cases. Going to
  Yucatan is a voluntary act which, requires the actor's co-operation, while
  dying is usually an involuntary affair."</p>

  <p>"Never mind," I cried. "We are bound to believe in free will up to a
  point. It's the condition on which life is conducted. What you must try to do
  is to banish the whole thing from your mind. Defy that damned oracle. You've
  begun right by getting into Parliament. Go on and make the best maiden speech
  of the day. Fate will always yield if you stand up to it."</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Leithen," he said. "I think that is sound advice. I'm ashamed
  to have let you see that the thing worried me. Nobody else in the world has
  the slightest notion... But you're an understanding fellow. If you're
  willing, you can be a wonderful stand-by to me, for I'm a lonely bird and apt
  to brood... I've another comfort, for there's that second man in the same
  case. I told you that I read the name of Colonel Dugald Chatto. I've made
  enquiries about him. He's a Glasgow wine merchant, who was a keen
  Territorial, and commanded a battalion in the War. Man about forty-seven, the
  hard, spare, scratch-man-at-golf type that never was ill in its life. Health
  is important, for The Times would have said 'killed,' if it had been death by
  accident. I've noticed that that's its custom."</p>

  <p>"There's nothing much wrong with your health," I put in.</p>

  <p>"No. I'm pretty fit."</p>

  <p>Again he stretched his arms, as if pushing an incubus away from him. He
  looked down at me with an embarrassed smile. But the next moment his eyes
  were abstracted and back in the shadowy corners.</p><br>

  <h3>III</h3>

  <p>Goodeve took his seat in the House, and then for a fortnight sat stolidly
  on the back Opposition benches. Everybody was curious about him, and our
  younger people were prepared to take him to their hearts. They elected him
  straight off a member of a group of Left-wing Tories, who dined together once
  a week and showed signs of becoming a Fourth Party. But he seemed to be shy
  of company. He never went near the smoking-room, he never wrote letters in
  the library, one never saw him gossiping in the lobbies. He was polite and
  friendly, but as aloof as the planet Mars. There he sat among the shadows of
  the back benches, listening attentively to the debates, with a queer secret
  smile on his face. One might have thought that he was contemptuous of it all,
  but for his interested eyes. He was watching closely how the game was played,
  but at the same time a big part of his mind was sojourning in another
  country.</p>

  <p>There was general interest in his maiden speech, and it was expected that
  it would come soon. You see, what was agitating the country at the moment was
  Geraldine's new crusade, and Goodeve had fought his election on that, and had
  indeed proved himself as good an exponent of the new Imperialism as his
  leader. Some of his sentences had already passed into the stock stuff of the
  press and the platform. He got the usual well-meant advice from the old
  hands. Members who did not know him would take him aside, and advise him to
  get the atmosphere of the place before he spoke. "It won't do," they told
  him, "to go off at half-cock. You've come here with a good deal of prestige,
  and you mustn't throw it away." Others thought that he should begin modestly
  and not wait for a full-dress occasion with red carpets down. "Slip into the
  debate quietly some dinner-hour," they counselled, "and try out your voice.
  The great thing is to get the ice broken. You'll have plenty of chances later
  for the bigger thing." Goodeve's smiling reticence, you see, made many people
  think that he would be nervous. I asked him about his plans, and he shook his
  head. "Haven't got any, I shall take my chance when it comes. I'm in no
  hurry." And then he added what I did not like. "It's a long time till the
  tenth of June."</p>

  <p>I asked our Whips, and was told that he had never spoken to them about the
  best moment to lift up his voice. They seemed to find him an enigma. John
  Fortingall, who ran the dining group I have mentioned, confessed himself
  puzzled. "I thought we had got an absolute winner," he declared, "but now I'm
  not so sure. There's no doubt about the brains, and they tell me he can put
  the stuff across. Everybody who knows him says he's a good fellow too. But
  all I can say is, he's a darned bad mixer. He looks at you as if you were his
  oldest friend, and then shoves you gently away as if you were going to pinch
  his tie-pin. Too frosty a lad for my taste."</p>

  <p>Goodeve told nobody about his plans, and he succeeded most successfully in
  surprising the House. He chose the most critical debate of the early session,
  which took place less than three weeks after he entered Parliament. It was a
  resolution of no confidence moved by Geraldine, and was meant to be a
  demonstration in force against the Government, and also a defiance to the
  stand-patters on our own side.</p>

  <p>There was no hope of success, for Waldemar and the Liberals would vote
  against it, and we could not count on polling our full strength, but it was
  believed that it might drive a wedge into Labour and have considerable effect
  in the country. Goodeve must have had some private arrangement with the
  Speaker, but he said nothing to his Front Bench. The Leader of the Opposition
  was as much taken by surprise as anybody.</p>

  <p>Geraldine moved the resolution in one of the best speeches I ever heard
  from him&mdash;conciliatory and persuasive, extraordinarily interesting, and
  salted with his engaging humour. He deliberately kept the key low, and
  attempted none of the flights of eloquence which had marked his campaign in
  the North. Mayot replied&mdash;the Prime Minister was to wind up the
  debate&mdash;and Mayot also was good. His line was the sagacious enthusiast,
  welcoming Geraldine's ideals, approving his general purpose, but damping down
  his ardours with wholesome common sense&mdash;the kind of speech which never
  fails of appeal to Englishmen. Then came Waldemar in a different mood. It was
  a first-class debating performance, and he searched out the joints in
  Geraldine's harness and probed them cunningly. He was giving no quarter, and
  there was vitriol on his sword's point. He concluded with a really fine
  defence of the traditional high-road of policy, and a warning against showy
  bypaths, superbly delivered and couched in pure, resounding,
  eighteenth-century prose. When he sat down there was nearly a minute of that
  whole-hearted applause which the House gives, irrespective of party, to a
  fine parliamentary achievement.</p>

  <p>Then Goodeve was called, and not, as was expected, the ex-Foreign
  Secretary. He had a wonderful audience, for the House was packed, and keyed
  up, too, by Waldemar, but it was the kind of audience which should have made
  the knees of a novice give under him. There had been three speeches by old
  parliamentary hands, each excellent of its kind, and any maiden effort must
  be an anticlimax. But Goodeve seemed to be unconscious of the peril. He was
  sitting at the corner of the second bench above the gangway, and had been
  taking notes unconcernedly while the others were speaking. He had a few slips
  of paper in his hand, and that hand did not shake. He looked around his
  audience, and his eye was composed. He began to speak, and his voice was full
  and steady...</p>

  <p>The House expects a new member to show a becoming modesty. A little
  diffidence, an occasional hesitation, are good tactics in a maiden speech,
  whether or not there be any reason for them. But there was no halting, no
  deprecatory air with Goodeve, and after the first minute nobody expected it.
  It would have been absurd, for this was clearly a master, every bit as much a
  master of the spoken word as Waldemar or Geraldine... I understood the reason
  for this composure. Goodeve knew that success was predestined.</p>

  <p>He began quietly and a little dully, but the House was held by its
  interest in his first appearance and by his pleasant voice. First he dealt
  with Mayot, and his courtesy could not prevent his contempt from peeping out.
  Mayot and his kind, he said, were mongers of opinion, specialists in airy
  buildings, but incapable of laying one solid brick on another on solid
  earth&mdash;a view received with enthusiasm by Collinson and some of the
  Labour Left Wing. Mayot, who was very ingenious at digging out awkward
  sentences from past Tory speeches, had quoted something from Arthur Balfour.
  Goodeve retorted with a most apposite quotation from Canning: "It is singular
  to remark how ready some people are to admire in a great man the exception
  rather than the rule of his conduct. Such perverse worship is like the
  idolatry of barbarous nations, who can see the noonday splendour of the sun
  without emotion, but who, when he is in eclipse, come forward with hymns and
  cymbals to adore him."</p>

  <p>But on the whole he dealt lightly with Mayot; it was when he turned to the
  more formidable Waldemar that he released his heavy batteries. He tore his
  speech to pieces with a fierce, but icy, gusto. There was no strained or
  rhetorical word, no excited gesture, no raising of the even, soothing voice,
  but every sentence was a lash flicking off its piece of skin. It was less an
  exposure of a speech than of a habit of mind and a school of thought.
  Waldemar, he said, was one of those to whom experience meant nothing, whose
  souls existed in a state of sacred torpidity prostrated before cold altars
  and departed gods. His appeal to common sense was only an appeal to the
  spiritual sluggishness which was England's besetting sin, and which in the
  present crisis was her deadliest peril. Waldemar's peroration had really
  moved the House, but Goodeve managed to strip the glamour from it and make it
  seem tinsel. He repeated some of the best sentences, and the connection in
  which he quoted them and the delicate irony of his tone made them comic.
  Members tittered, and the Liberal Front Bench had savage faces. It was one of
  the cleverest and cruellest feats I have ever seen performed in debate.</p>

  <p>Then he turned on the "big business" section of his own party, who were
  hostile to Geraldine, and had begun to coquet with Waldemar. Here he fairly
  let himself go. He addressed the Speaker, but every now and then wheeled
  slowly round and looked the wrathful, high-coloured magnates in the face. The
  extraordinary thing was that they made no audible protest; the tension of the
  House was too great for that. In Mayot he had trounced the timid visionary,
  in Waldemar the arid dogmatist, and in these gentry he dealt with the strong,
  silent, practical man. He defined him, in Disraeli's words, as "one who
  practises the blunders of his predecessors." They were always talking about
  being consistent, about sticking to their principles, about taking a strong
  line. What were their principles? he asked urbanely. Not those of the Tory
  Party, which had always looked squarely at realities, and had never been
  hidebound in its methods. Was it not possible that they mistook stupidity for
  consistency, blind eyes for balanced minds? As for their vaunted strength, it
  was that of cast-iron and not of steel, and their courage was the timidity of
  men who lived in terror of being called weak. In the grim world we lived in
  there was no room for such fifth-form heroics.</p>

  <p>All this was polished and deadly satire which delighted everyone but its
  victims. And then he suddenly changed his mood. After a warm expression of
  loyalty to Geraldine, he gave his own version of the road to a happier
  country. It was a dangerous thing for a man who had been making game of
  Waldemar's eloquence to be eloquent on his own account, but Goodeve attempted
  it, and he brilliantly succeeded. His voice fell to a quiet reflective note.
  He seemed to be soliloquising, like a weary man who, having been in the dust
  of the lists, now soothes himself with his secret dreams. The last part of
  his speech was almost poetry, and I do not think that in my long
  parliamentary experience I ever heard anything like it. Certainly nothing
  that so completely captured its hearers. Very gently he seemed to be opening
  windows beyond which lay a pleasant landscape.</p>

  <p>He spoke for a few minutes under the hour, an extravagant measure for a
  maiden speech. There was very little applause, for members seemed to be
  spell-bound. I have never seen the House hushed for so long. Then an
  extraordinary thing happened. The Prime Minister thought it necessary to rise
  at once, but he had a poor audience. The House emptied, as if members felt it
  necessary to go elsewhere to get their bearings again and to talk over this
  portent.</p>

  <p>Goodeve kept his place till Trant finished, and then he followed me out of
  the House. We went down to the terrace, which was empty, for it was a grey
  November afternoon with a slight drizzle. After a big oratorical effort,
  especially a triumphant effort, a man generally relaxes, and becomes cheerful
  and confidential. Not so Goodeve. He scarcely listened to my heartfelt
  congratulations. I remember how he leaned over the parapet, watching the
  upstream flow of the leaden tide, and spoke to the water and not to me.</p>

  <p>"It is no credit to me," he said. "I was completely confident... You know
  why... That made me able to put out every ounce I had in me, for I knew it
  would be all right. If you were in for a race and knew positively that you
  would win, you would be bound to run better than you ever ran before."</p>

  <p>I have a vivid recollection of that moment, for I felt somehow that it was
  immensely critical. Here was a man who by his first speech had turned
  politics topsy-turvy. Inside the Palace of Westminster every corridor was
  humming with his name; in the newspaper offices journalists were writing
  columns of impressions, and editors preparing leaders on the subject; already
  London tea-tables would be toothing it, and that night it would be the chief
  topic at dinner. And here was the man responsible for it all as cold as a
  tombstone, negligent of the fame he had won, and thinking only of its
  relation to a few lines of type that would not be set up for half a year.</p>

  <p>My problem was his psychology, not facts, but the way he looked at them,
  and I gave him what I considered sound advice. I told him that he had done a
  thing which was new in the history of Parliament. By one speech he had
  advanced to front-bench status. Party politics were all at sixes and sevens,
  and he had now the ear of the House as much as Trant and Geraldine. If he
  cared he could have a chief hand in the making of contemporary history. He
  MUST care, and for this reason&mdash;that it was the best way to falsify The
  Times paragraph. If he went on as he had begun, in six months anything that
  might happen to him would not get half a dozen lines but a column and
  half-inch headings. He had it in his own power to make that disquieting
  glimpse at Flambard an illusion... You see, I was treating the Flambard
  affair seriously. I had decided that that was the best plan, since it had so
  eaten into Goodeve's soul.</p>

  <p>I remember that he sighed and nodded his head, as if he agreed with me. He
  refused an invitation to dine, and left without going back to the Chamber.
  Nor did he return for the division&mdash; an excited scene, for Geraldine's
  motion was only lost by seventeen votes, owing to many Labour members
  abstaining.</p><br>

  <h3>IV</h3>

  <p>Next week old Folliot asked me to luncheon. It was about the time when,
  under Mayot's influence, he was beginning to sidle back into politics. I had
  known him so long that I had acquired a kind of liking for him as a
  milestone&mdash;he made me feel the distance I had travelled, and I often
  found his tattle restful.</p>

  <p>We lunched at his club in St James's Street. The old fellow had not
  changed his habits, for he still had his pint of champagne in a silver mug,
  and his eye was always lifting to note people whose acquaintance he liked to
  claim. But I found that what he wanted was not to impart the latest gossip
  but to question me. He was acutely interested in Goodeve, and wished to know
  everything about him.</p>

  <p>"It is the sorrow of my life," he told me, "that I missed his speech. I
  had a card for the Distinguished Strangers' Gallery, as it happened, and I
  meant to go there for the opening of the debate. But I had some American
  friends lunching with me, and we stayed on talking and I gave up the idea.
  You heard it, of course? Did it sound as well as it read? I confess it seemed
  to me a most refreshing return to the grand manner. I remember Randolph
  Churchill... " Folliot strayed into reminiscences of past giants, but he
  always pulled himself up and came back to the point, for he seemed deeply
  curious about Goodeve. "His assurance now&mdash;astonishing in a young man,
  but I understand that it did not offend the House... Of course the speech
  must have been carefully prepared, and yet it had real debating qualities.
  That quip about Waldemar's reference to Mr G, for example&mdash;he could not
  have anticipated that Waldemar would give him such a chance... With the
  close, I confess, I was less impressed. Excellent English, but many people
  can speak good English. Ah, no doubt! Better to hear than to read. They tell
  me he has a most seductive voice."</p>

  <p>I could tell him little, for I had only known Goodeve for six months, but
  I expanded in praise of the speech. Folliot cross-examined me closely about
  his manner. Was there a proper urbanity in his satire? Did he convince the
  House that he was in earnest? Was there no pedantry?&mdash;too many
  quotations, possibly? The House did not relish the academic. Above all, was
  there the accent of authority? Could he keep the field together as well as
  show it sport?</p>

  <p>"He may be the man we have all been looking for," he said. "On paper he
  certainly fills the bill. Young enough, good-looking, well-born, rich,
  educated, fine War record, considerable business knowledge. He sounds almost
  too good to be true. My one doubt is whether he will stay the course. You
  see, I know something about the Goodeves. I knew his uncle, old Sir
  Adolphus."</p>

  <p>I pricked up my ears. Folliot was beginning to interest me.</p>

  <p>"A singular family, the Goodeves," he went on. "Always just about to
  disappear from the earth, and always saved by a miracle. This young man was
  the son of the parson, Adolphus' brother, who was cut off with a hundred
  pounds because he took up with the High Church lot, while his father was a
  crazy Evangelical. Adolphus avenged him, for he wasn't any sort of Christian
  at all. I remember the old man well. He was a militant Agnostic, a worshipper
  at the Huxley and Tyndall shrines&mdash;dear me, how all that has gone out
  today! He used to come to Town to address meetings in the Essex Hall, to
  which he invited a selection of the London clergy. They never went, but some
  of us young men used to go, and we were always rewarded. The old fellow had
  quite a Disraeli touch in vituperation. He was a shocking scarecrow to look
  at, though he had a fine high-nosed face. Not always washed and shaven, I
  fear. His clothes were a disgrace&mdash;his trousers were half-way up his
  legs, and his hat and coat were green with age. He never spent a penny he
  could avoid, always travelled third class and had only one club, because it
  did not charge for bread and cheese and beer, and so he could lunch free. He
  had a dread that he might die in beggary&mdash;scattered his money in youth,
  and then got scared and relapsed into a miser. He died worth a quarter of a
  million, but all the cash they found in the house was ninepence. Hence the
  comfortable fortune of your young friend. That was so like the
  Goodeves&mdash;they were always having notions&mdash;panics, you might call
  them&mdash; which perverted their lives."</p>

  <p>Folliot had more to say about Sir Adolphus. He had been a distinguished
  marine biologist in his youth, and had made an expedition to the Great
  Barrier Reef and written a notable book about it. Then he had suddenly cut
  adrift from the whole business. Something gave him a distaste for
  it&mdash;the handling of an octopus, Folliot suggested, or too close an
  acquaintance with a man-eating shark. "Terribly high-strung people," said
  Folliot. "They didn't acquire dislikes, so much as horrors. People used to
  say that Adolphus' aversion to Christianity was due to his having been once
  engaged to Priscilla Aberley. She was very devout in those days, and was by
  way of saving his soul, so, when she jilted him for Aberley, Adolphus had no
  more use for souls in the parson's sense."</p>

  <p>"He died only a year or two ago," I put in. "Did you see anything of him
  in his last days?"</p>

  <p>Folliot smiled. "Not I. Nobody did, except the doctor. I understand that
  he wouldn't have this young man near the place. He shut himself up, and
  nursed his health as he nursed his money. He must have launched out at last,
  for he had a scientific valet to see that his rooms were kept at an even
  temperature, and he had a big consultant down from London if he had as much
  as a cold in his head... A little mad, perhaps. It looked as if he were in
  terror of death. Odd in a man who did not believe in any kind of after-life.
  I fancy that was one of the family traits."</p>

  <p>"I can't agree," I said. "They were a most gallant race. I've poked a
  little way into the family history, and there was hardly a British war in
  which a Goodeve did not distinguish himself and get knocked on the head.
  Unlucky, if you like, but not a trace of the white feather."</p>

  <p>Then Folliot said a thing which gave me some respect for his intelligence.
  "No doubt that is true. They could face death comfortably if it came to them
  in hot blood. But they could not wait for it with equanimity. They had
  spirit, if you like, but not fortitude."</p>

  <p>I was so struck by this remark that I missed what Folliot said next.
  Apparently he was talking about a Goodeve woman, a great-aunt of my friend.
  She had been some sort of peeress, but I did not catch the title, and her
  Christian name had been Portia.</p>

  <p>"Old Lady Manorwater knew her well, and used to speak much of her. She had
  been a raging beauty in her youth, and no better than she should be, people
  said. Lawrence painted her as Circe&mdash;they have the picture at Wirlesdon
  in the green drawing-room&mdash;you must remember it. When she married she
  ranged herself and gave no further occasion for scandal, but she was still
  the despair of other wives, for their husbands hung round her like flies
  round honey. The Duke of Wellington was said to write to her every day, and
  his brougham stopped at her door twice a week. Melbourne dangled about her
  skirts, and the young Disraeli wrote her infamous poetry... And then
  something snapped. She began to get crises of religious terror, and would
  have parsons to pray with her half the night. Gay as a bird in between, you
  understand, but when the cloud descended she was virtually a mad-woman. It
  heightened her beauty and made it more spiritual, for there was a haunted,
  other-world look in her face. There's a passage about her in one of Carlyle's
  letters. He met her somewhere, and wrote that he could not get her out of his
  head, for she had eyes like a stricken deer's. 'God pity the man or
  woman'&mdash;I think these are his words&mdash;'on whom the fear of Jehovah
  has fallen. They must break the world, or be themselves broken.'"</p>

  <p>Folliot saw my interest and was flattered, for he omitted to fuss about
  the club port.</p>

  <p>"Well, she broke," he continued. "She died... quite young. They called it
  a decline, but old Lady Manorwater said it was fear&mdash;naked fear. There
  was nothing the matter with her body... Yes, there were children. Rupert
  Trensham is her grandson, but the Trensham stock is prosaic enough to steady
  the Goodeve blood."</p>

  <p>I had to hurry back to chambers, and left Folliot ordering a liqueur.</p>

  <p>"A queer race," were his parting words. "That is why I wonder if this
  young man will last the course. They have spirit without fortitude."</p>

  <p>My appreciation of that phrase had pleased the old fellow. I knew that for
  the next fortnight he would he repeating it all over London.</p><br>

  <h3>V</h3>

  <p>During the next three months I had the miserable job of looking on at what
  was nothing less than a parliamentary tragedy. For I watched Goodeve
  labouring to follow my advice and dismally failing.</p>

  <p>He began with every chance. The impression made by his maiden speech was a
  living memory; he was usually called by the Speaker when he got up, and the
  House filled when the word went round that he was on his feet. Geraldine's
  new policy was still the chief issue, and, after its author, Goodeve was its
  chief exponent. Moreover, he had established a reputation for wit, and for
  dealing faithfully with opponents, and the House loves a gladiatorial
  show.</p>

  <p>Having started with fireworks, he attempted in the orthodox way to get a
  name for solid sense and practical knowledge. His next effort, a week later,
  was on some supplementary estimates, a rather long and quite prosaic analysis
  of a batch of figures. I heard much of it, and was on the whole disappointed.
  It was all too laboured; he did not make his points cleanly enough; indeed,
  it was just the kind of thing which your city man fires off once every
  session to a small and inattentive House. It had none of the art of his first
  speech and, though he got a good press, it had no real effect upon the
  debate.</p>

  <p>Then he took to intervening briefly in every kind of discussion. He was
  always more or less relevant, but what he said was generally platitudinous.
  On the occasions I heard him I missed any note of distinction. He was the
  ordinary, fairly intelligent member putting up ordinary, fairly intelligent
  debating points. Our Whips loved him, for he was always ready to keep a
  debate going when called upon, and I think members approved his modesty in
  not reserving himself for full-dress occasions. But I could not disguise from
  myself the fact that his reputation was declining. He, who had got well ahead
  of other people, had now decorously fallen back into the ranks.</p>

  <p>All this time he mixed little with his fellows. He only once attended a
  dinner of his group, and then scarcely uttered a word. Sally Flambard
  attempted in vain to get him to her political luncheons. So far as I knew, he
  never talked politics with anybody. But he rarely missed a division, and
  would sit solidly to the close of the dreariest debate. He had taken his seat
  near the end of the third bench below the gangway, so I had no chance of
  watching his face. But one evening I made an opportunity by going up into the
  opposite gallery. He sat very still and composed, I remember, with his eyes
  narrowed and his head a little bent forward. But the impression I got was of
  a terrific effort at self-restraint. He was schooling himself to something
  which he hated and dreaded, bracing himself to an effort on which fateful
  things depended, and the schooling had brought his nerves to
  cracking-point.</p>

  <p>I did not see him during the Christmas vacation. Then in February came the
  crisis which I have already recorded, when the nation suddenly woke up to the
  meaning of the unemployment figures, and Chuff began his extra-mural
  campaign, and parties split themselves up into Activists and Passivists. You
  would have said that it was the ideal occasion for Goodeve to take the lead.
  It was the situation which his maiden speech had forecast and it was the
  spirit of that maiden speech which was needed. Waldemar and Mayot were the
  leading Passivists, and, Heaven knows, they gave openings enough for a
  critic. Judging by his early form, Goodeve could have turned them inside out
  and made them the laughing-stock of the country, and he could have made
  magnificent play with the Prime Minister's shuffling. He could have toned
  down Collinson's violence, and steadied some of the younger Tories who were
  beginning to talk wildly. Above all, he could have produced an Activist
  policy based on common sense, which was the crying need. Geraldine could not
  do it; he was always the parliamentarian rather than the statesman.</p>

  <p>Goodeve tried and most comprehensively failed. He simply could not hold
  the House&mdash;could hold it far less than Lanyard, who had a voice like a
  pea-hen, or John Fortingall, who stuttered and hesitated and rarely got a
  verb into his sentences. At his first appearance he had shown an amazing gift
  of catching the atmosphere of the assembly and gripping its attention in a
  vice. His air had had authority in it, his voice had been compelling, his
  confidence had impressed without offending. But now... great God! he seemed a
  different man. I heard him try to tackle Mayot, but Mayot, who had looked
  nervous when he rose, beamed happily as he continued and laughed aloud when
  he sat down. There was no grip in him, no word spoken out of strong belief,
  no blow launched with the weight of the body behind it. He seemed to be
  repeating&mdash;hesitatingly&mdash;a lesson which he had imperfectly learned
  by heart. His personality, once so clean-cut and potent, had dissolved into a
  vapour.</p>

  <p>I missed none of his speeches, and with each my heart grew heavier. For I
  realised the cause of his fiasco... Goodeve was a haunted man, haunted by a
  dreadful foreknowledge of fate. In his maiden speech fate had been on his
  side, since he had a definite assurance that he must succeed. But now he was
  fighting against fate. The same source, which gave him the certainty of his
  initial triumph, had denied him the hope of further success. As I had
  advised, he was striving now to coerce fate, to alter what he believed to be
  his destiny, to stultify what had been decreed... He could not do it. That
  very knowledge which had once given him confidence was now keeping it from
  him. He had no real hope. He was battling against what he believed to be
  foreordained. How could a man succeed when he understood in his heart that
  the Eternal Powers had predestined failure?</p>

  <p>Yet most gallantly he persevered, for it was a matter of life and death. I
  alone knew the tragedy of it. To other people he was only a politician who
  was not living up to his promise, the "Single-speech Hamilton" of our day.
  But behind the epigrams which did not sting, the appeals which rang feebly,
  the arguments which lacked bite, the perorations which did not glow, I saw a
  condemned man struggling desperately for a reprieve.</p>

  <p>His last speech was on the Ministry of Labour estimates, when John
  Fortingall's motion nearly brought the Government down. He rose late in the
  debate, when the House was packed and the air was electric, since a close
  division was certain. Waldemar had made one of his sagacious, polysyllabic,
  old-world orations, and Collinson from the Labour benches had replied with a
  fiery appeal to the House to give up ancestor-worship and face realities. For
  one moment I thought that Goodeve was going to come off at last. He began
  briskly, almost with spirit, and he looked the Treasury bench squarely in the
  face. His voice, too, had a better ring in it. Clearly he had braced himself
  for a great effort... Then he got into a mesh of figures, and the attention
  of members slackened. He managed them badly, losing his way in his notes,
  and, when one item was questioned, he gave a lame explanation. He never
  finished that section of his case, for he seemed to feel that he was losing
  the House, so he hurried on to what he must have prepared most carefully, a
  final appeal somewhat on the lines of his maiden speech. But ah! the
  difference! To be eloquent and moving one must have either complete
  self-confidence or complete forgetfulness of self, and Goodeve had neither.
  He seemed once again to be repeating a lesson badly learned; his voice broke
  in a rotund sentence so that it sounded falsetto; in an appeal which should
  have rung like a trumpet he forgot his piece, and it ended limply. Never have
  I listened to anything more painful. Members grew restless and began to talk.
  Goodeve's voice became shrill, he dropped it to a whisper, and then raised it
  to an unmeaning shout... He paused&mdash;and someone tittered... He sat
  down.</p>

  <p>When Trant rose an hour later to wind up the debate Goodeve hurried from
  the House. To the best of my belief he never entered it again.</p><br>

  <h3>VI</h3>

  <p>Towards the end of March I had to speak in Glasgow, and since my meeting
  was in the afternoon I travelled up by the night train. I was breakfasting in
  the hotel, when to my surprise I saw Goodeve at an adjacent table. Somehow
  Glasgow was not the kind of place where one expected to find him.</p>

  <p>He joined me, and I had a good look at him. The man was lamentably thin,
  but at first sight I thought that he looked well. His dusky complexion was a
  very fair imitation of sunburn, and that and his lean cheeks suggested a man
  in hard training. But the next moment I revised my view. He moved listlessly
  and wearily, and his eyes were sick. It was some fever of spirit, not health,
  that gave him his robust colouring.</p>

  <p>I had to hurry off to do some business, so I suggested that we should
  lunch together. He agreed, but mentioned that he had invited a man to
  luncheon&mdash;that very Colonel Dugald Chatto whose name he had read in the
  same obituary paragraph as his own. I said that I should like to meet him,
  and asked how Goodeve had managed to achieve the acquaintance. Quite simply,
  he said. He had got a friend to take him to golf at Prestwick, where Colonel
  Chatto played regularly, had been introduced to him in the club-house, and
  had on subsequent occasions played several rounds with him... "Not a bad
  fellow," he said, and then, when he saw my wondering eyes, he laughed. "I
  must keep close to him, for, you see, we are more intimately linked than any
  other two people in the world. We are like the pairs tied up by Carrier in
  his noyades in the Loire&mdash;you remember, in the French Revolution. We
  sink or swim together."</p>

  <p>You could not have found a starker opposite to Goodeve than Chatto if you
  had ransacked the globe. He was a little stocky man, with a scraggy neck,
  sandy hair and a high-coloured face, who looked as if he took a good deal of
  both exercise and whisky. He said he was pleased to meet me, and he thumped
  Goodeve on the back. He was a cheerful soul.</p>

  <p>He ate a hearty luncheon and he was full of chat in the juiciest of
  accents. He had grievances against the War Office because of their treatment
  of the Territorial division in which he had served, and he had some scathing
  things to say about politicians. His sympathies were with the Right Wing of
  our party, which Goodeve disliked. "I'm not blaming you, Sir Edward," he told
  me. "You're a lawyer, and mostly talk sense, if you don't mind my saying so.
  But Goodeve here used to splash about something awful. I remember reading his
  speeches, and wishing I could get five minutes with him in a quiet place. I
  tell you, I've done a good job for the country in keeping him out of
  Parliament, for he hasn't been near it since him and me foregathered. I'm
  making quite a decent golfer of him, too. A wee bit weak in his short game
  still, but that'll improve."</p>

  <p>He was a vulgar, jolly little man with nothing in his head, and no
  conversation except war reminiscences, golf shop, and a fund of rather broad
  Scots stories. Also he was a bit of an angler, the kind that enters for
  competitions on Loch Leven. When I listened to him I wondered how the
  fastidious Goodeve could endure him for half an hour. But Goodeve did more
  than endure him, for a real friendship seemed to have sprung up between them.
  There was interest, almost affection, in his eyes. Chatto, no doubt, thought
  it a tribute to his charms, and being a simple soul, he returned it. He did
  not know of the uncanny chain which linked the two incompatibles. I can
  imagine, if Goodeve had told him, the stalwart incredulity with which he
  would have received the confession.</p>

  <p>The hotel boasted some old brandy which Chatto insisted on our sampling.
  "Supplied by my own firm, gentlemen, long before I was born." After that he
  took to calling Goodeve "Bob." "Bob here is coming with me to Macrihanish,
  and we're going to make a week of it."</p>

  <p>"Don't forget that you're coming to me for the May-fly," Goodeve reminded
  him.</p>

  <p>"Not likely I'll forget. That'll be a new kind of ploy for me. I'm not
  sure I'll be much good at it, but I'm young enough to learn... Man, I get
  younger every day. I got a new lease of life out of that bloody war. Talk
  about shellshock! I'm the opposite! I'm shell-stimulated, if you see what I
  mean."</p>

  <p>He expanded in recollections, comments, anticipations, variegated by
  high-flavoured anecdotes. He had become perhaps a little drunk. One could not
  help liking the fellow, and I began to feel grateful to him when I saw how
  Goodeve seemed to absorb confidence from his company. The man was so vital
  and vigorous that the other drew comfort from the sight of him. Almost all
  the sickness went out of Goodeve's eyes. His comrade in the noyades was not
  likely to drown, and his buoyancy might sustain them both.</p>

  <p>Goodeve saw me off by the night train. I said something complimentary
  about Chatto.</p>

  <p>"There's more in him than you realise at first," he said, "and he's the
  kindliest little chap alive. What does it matter that he doesn't talk our
  talk? I'm sick of all that old world of mine."</p>

  <p>I said something about Chatto's health.</p>

  <p>"Pretty nearly perfect. Now and then he does himself a little too well, as
  at luncheon today, but that was the excitement of meeting a swell like you.
  Usually he is very careful. I've made enquiries among his friends, and have
  got to know his doctor. The doctor says he has a constitution of steel and
  teak."</p>

  <p>"And you yourself?" I asked. "You're a little fine-drawn, aren't you?"</p>

  <p>For a moment there was alarm in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Not a bit of it. I'm very well. I've been vetted by the same doctor. He
  gave me the cleanest bill of health, but advised me not to worry. That's why
  I have cut out Parliament and come up here. Being with Chatto takes me out of
  myself. He's as good for me as oxygen."</p>

  <p>When I asked about his plans he said he had none. He meant to be a good
  deal in the North, and see as much of Chatto as possible. Chatto was a
  bachelor with a country-house in Dumbartonshire, and Goodeve was in treaty
  for a shooting nearby. I could see the motive of that: it was vital for him
  to pretend to himself that the coming tenth of June meant nothing, and to
  arrange for shooting grouse two months later.</p>

  <p>I entered my sleeping-berth fairly well satisfied. It was right that
  Goodeve should keep in close touch with the man whom destiny had joined to
  him, and it was the mercy of Providence that this man should be an embodiment
  of careless, exuberant life.</p><br>

  <h3>VII</h3>

  <p>May was of course occupied with the General Election, and for the better
  part of it I had no time to think of anything beyond the small change of
  political controversy. I saw that Goodeve was not standing again for the
  Marton division, and I wondered casually if the florid Chatto had spent the
  May-fly season on the limpid and intricate waters which I knew so well. I
  pigeonholed a resolution to hunt up Goodeve as soon as I got a moment to turn
  round.</p>

  <p>Oddly enough, the first news I got of him was from Chatto, whom I met at a
  Scottish junction.</p>

  <p>"Ugh, ay!" said that worthy. "I've been sojourning in the stately homes of
  England. Did you ever see such a place as yon? I hadn't a notion that Bob was
  such a big man in his own countryside? Ay, I caught some trout, but I worked
  hard for them. Yon's too expert a job for me, but, by God, Bob's the fine
  hand at it."</p>

  <p>I asked him about Goodeve's health and whereabouts. "He's in London," was
  the answer. "I had a line from him yesterday. He was thinking of going on a
  wee cruise in a week or two. One of those yachting trips that the big
  steamship companies run&mdash;to Norway or some place like that. His health,
  you say? 'Deed, I don't quite know how to answer that. He wants toning up, I
  think. Him and me had a week at Macrihanish and, instead of coming on, his
  game went back every day. There were times when he seemed to have no pith in
  him. Down at Goodeve he was much the same. There's not much exertion in
  dry-fly fishing, but every now and then he would lie on his back and appear
  as tired as if he had been wrestling with a sixteen-foot salmon rod on the
  Awe. And yet he looks as healthy as a deep-sea sailor. As I say, he wants
  toning up, and maybe the sea-air is the thing for him."</p>

  <p>The consequence of this talk was that I wired to Goodeve, and found that
  he was still in London on some matter of business. Next day&mdash;I think it
  was May thirty-first&mdash;we dined together at his club. This time I was
  genuinely scared by his looks, for in the past five or six weeks he had gone
  rapidly downhill. His colour was still high, but now it was definitely
  unwholesome, and his thinness had become emaciation. His clothes hung on him
  loosely and there were ugly hollows at his temples. Also&mdash;and this was
  what alarmed me&mdash;his eyes had the gaunt, hungry, foreboding look that I
  remembered in Moe's.</p>

  <p>Of course I said nothing about his health, but his first enquiry was about
  Chatto's, when he heard that I had seen him. I told him that I had never seen
  such an example of bodily well-being, and he murmured something which sounded
  like "Thank God!"</p>

  <p>It was no good beating about the bush, for the time for any pretence
  between us had long passed.</p>

  <p>"In another fortnight," I said, "you will be rid of this nightmare. Now,
  what is the best way of putting in the time? I'm thinking of your comfort,
  for, as you know, I don't believe there is the slightest substance in all
  that nonsense. But it is real to you, and we must make our book for
  that."</p>

  <p>"I agree," he said. "I thought of going for a cruise in the North Sea. The
  boat's called the Runeberg, I think&mdash;a Norwegian steamer chartered by a
  British firm. I fancy it's the kind of thing for me, for these cruises are
  always crowded&mdash;a sort of floating Blackpool. There's certain to be
  nobody I know on board, and the discomfort of a rackety company will keep me
  from brooding. If we get bad weather, so much the better, for I'm a rotten
  sailor. I've booked my cabin, and we sail from Leith on the sixth."</p>

  <p>I told him that I warmly approved. "That's the common sense of the thing,"
  I said. "You must bluff your confounded premonitions. On June tenth you'll be
  sitting on deck inside the Skerrygard, forgetting that there's such a thing
  as a newspaper. What's Chatto doing?"</p>

  <p>"Going on as usual. Business four days a week and golf the rest. He has no
  foreboding to worry him. I get frequent news of his health, you know. I have
  a friend in a Glasgow lawyer's office, who knows both him and his doctor, and
  he sends me reports. I wonder what he thinks of it all. A David and Jonathan
  friendship, I hope; but these Glasgow lawyers never let you see what is
  inside their mind."</p>

  <p>On the whole I was better pleased with the situation. Goodeve was facing
  it bravely and philosophically, and Chatto was a sheet-anchor. In a fortnight
  it would be all over, and he could laugh at his tremors. He was due back in
  Town from the cruise on the twentieth, and we arranged to dine together. I
  could see that he was playing up well to his plan, and filling up his time
  with engagements beyond the tenth.</p>

  <p>I asked him what he proposed to do before he sailed. There was a weekend
  with Chatto, he said, and then he must go back to Goodeve for a day or two on
  estate business. I had to return to the House for a division, and, being
  suddenly struck afresh by Goodeve's air of fragility, I urged him, as we
  parted, to go straight to bed.</p>

  <p>He shook his head. "I'm going for a long walk," he said. "I walk half the
  night, for I sleep badly. My only chance is to tire out my body."</p>

  <p>"You can't stand much more of that," I told him. "What does your doctor
  say?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. It isn't a case for doctors. I'm fighting, you see, and
  it's taking a lot out of me. The fight is not with the arm of flesh, but the
  flesh must pay."</p>

  <p>"You're as certain to win as that the sun will rise tomorrow." These were
  my last words to him, and I put my hand on his shoulder. He started at the
  touch, but his eyes looked me steadily in the face. God knows what was in
  them&mdash; suffering in the extreme, fear to the uttermost, courage, too, of
  the starkest. But one thing I realised&mdash;they were like Moe's eyes; and I
  left the club with a pain at my heart.</p><br>

  <h3>VIII</h3>

  <p>I never saw Goodeve again. But the following are the facts which I learned
  afterwards.</p>

  <p>He went to Prestwick with Chatto and played vile golf. Chatto, who was on
  the top of his game and in high spirits, lost his temper with his pupil, and
  then began in his kindly way to fuss about his health. He asked a doctor
  friend in the club-house to have a look at him, but Goodeve refused his
  attentions, declaring that he was perfectly fit. Then, after arranging to
  lunch with Chatto in Glasgow on the sixth before sailing from Leith, Goodeve
  went south.</p>

  <p>It was miserable weather in that first week of June, wet and raw, with a
  searching east wind. Chatto went to Loch Leven to fish, and got soaked to the
  skin. He came home with a feverish cold which developed into pleurisy, and on
  the fifth was taken into a nursing-home. Early on the sixth he developed
  pneumonia, and before noon on that day Goodeve's Glasgow lawyer friend had
  sent him this news.</p>

  <p>Goodeve should have been in Glasgow that morning, since he was to sail in
  the Runeberg in the late afternoon. But he had already cancelled his
  passage&mdash;I think on the fifth. Why he did that I do not know. It could
  have had nothing to do with Chatto's illness, of which he had not yet heard.
  He may have felt that a sea-voyage was giving an unnecessary hostage to
  destiny. Or he may have felt that his own bodily strength was unequal to the
  effort. Or some overpowering sense of fatality may have come down like a
  shutter on his mind. I do not know, and I shall never know.</p>

  <p>What is clear is that at Goodeve before the sixth his health had gravely
  worsened. He could not lie in bed, and he refused to have a doctor, so he sat
  in a dressing-gown in his shadowy library, or pottered weakly about the
  ground-floor rooms. His old butler grew very anxious, for his meals were left
  almost untasted. Several times he tried to rally his spirits, and he drank a
  little champagne, and once he had up a bottle of the famous port. He had a
  book always with him, the collected works of Sir Thomas Browne, but according
  to the butler, it was generally lying unread on his knee. When he got the
  telegram about Chatto's illness, his valet told me, he read it several times,
  let it drop on the floor, and sat for a minute or two looking fixedly before
  him. Then he seemed to make an effort to pull himself together. He ordered
  fires to be lit in the long gallery upstairs, and said that henceforth that
  should be his sitting-room.</p>

  <p>For three days Goodeve lived in that cloudy chamber under the portraits of
  his ancestors with their tremulous, anxious eyes. There was a little
  powdering-closet next door, where he had a bed made up. Fires were kept
  blazing night and day on all the four hearths, for he seemed to feel the
  cold. I believe that he had made up his mind that Chatto must die, and that
  he must follow. He had several bulletins daily from Glasgow, and, said his
  valet, seemed scarcely to glance at them. But on the ninth he asked eagerly
  for telegrams, as if he expected one of moment. He was noticeably frailer,
  the servants told me, and he seemed sunk in a deep lethargy, and sat very
  still with his eyes on the fire. Several times he walked the length of the
  gallery, gazing at the portraits.</p>

  <p>About six o'clock on the evening of the ninth the telegram came announcing
  Chatto's death. Goodeve behaved as if he had expected it, and there came a
  flicker of life into his face. He sent for champagne and drank a little,
  lifting up his glass as if he were giving a toast. He told his valet that he
  would not require him again, but would put himself to bed. The last the man
  saw of him he was smiling, and his lips were moving...</p>

  <p>In the morning he was found dead in his chair. The autopsy that followed
  resulted in a verdict of death from heart failure. I alone knew that the
  failure had come about by the slow relentless sapping of fear.</p>

  <p>There was wild weather in the North Sea on the eighth, and in the darkness
  before dawn on the ninth the Runeberg was driven on to a reef and sank with
  all on board. As it chanced, Goodeve's name was still on its list of
  passengers, and it was because of the news of the shipwreck that The Times
  published his obituary on the tenth. Next day it issued the necessary
  correction, and an extended obituary which recorded that his death had really
  taken place at his country house.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap6"
     id="chap6">VI. &mdash; CAPTAIN CHARLES OTTERY</a></h2>

  <p class="quote"><i>"And because time in it selfe... can receive no
  alteration, the hallowing must consist in the shape or countenance which we
  put upon the affaires that are incident in these dayes."</i><br>
  <br>
  &mdash;Richard Hooker, <i>Ecclesiastical Polity</i>.</p>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p>The announcement on the first page of The Times, which Charles Ottery read
  at Flambard, and every letter of which was printed on his mind, ran thus:</p>

  <p class="newspaper">"OTTERY&mdash;Suddenly in London on the 9th inst.,
  Captain Charles Ottery, late Scots Fusiliers, of Marlcote, Glos., at the age
  of 36."</p>

  <p>It fitted his case precisely. The regiment was right (the dropping of the
  "Royal" before its title was a familiar journalistic omission), Marlcote was
  his family place, and in June of the following year he would have just passed
  his thirty-sixth birthday.</p>

  <p>I had known Charles since he was a schoolboy, for he was my nephew's
  friend, and many a half-sovereign I had tipped him in those days. He was the
  only child of a fine old Crimean veteran, and had gone straight from school
  into the family regiment, for a succession of Otterys had served in the Royal
  Scots Fusiliers, though they had not a drop of Scots blood. They came
  originally, I believe, from Devonshire, but had been settled for a couple of
  centuries in the Severn valley. Charles was a delightful boy, with
  old-fashioned manners, for he had been strictly brought up. He always called
  his father "sir," I remember, and rose when he entered the room. He had a
  rather sullen, freckled face, tawny hair which curled crisply, and pale-blue
  eyes which could kindle into a dancing madness, or freeze into a curious
  mature solemnity. What impressed one about him as a boy was the feeling he
  gave of latent power. He never seemed to put all of himself into
  anything&mdash;there was an impression always of heavy reserves waiting to be
  called up. He was the average successful schoolboy, not specially brilliant
  at anything except at court-tennis, but generally liked and greatly
  respected. No one ever took liberties with Master Charles, for the sheath of
  pleasant manners was felt to cover a particularly stiff bone.</p>

  <p>The War broke out when he had been a soldier for six months, and Charles
  went to France in September 1914. As his friends expected, he made an
  admirable regimental officer&mdash;one of the plain fighting men who were
  never sick or sorry during four gruelling years. Being a regular, he had no
  sensational advancement; he got his company during the Somme, and later had
  one or two staff jobs, from which he always managed to wangle a speedy return
  to his battalion. He was happy, because he was young and healthy and
  competent, and loved his men. After the Armistice he had the better part of a
  year in Ireland, a miserable time which tried him far more sorely in mind and
  body than his four years in France. Then his father died, and as soon as the
  Scots Fusiliers had finished their Irish tour Charles left the Service.</p>

  <p>He inherited a large and unlucrative landed estate; he was devoted to
  Marlcote, and he had to find some means of earning money if he wanted to
  retain it. Through the influence of an uncle he was taken into a London firm
  of merchant-bankers, and in his quiet resolute way set himself to learn his
  job. He proved to have a genuine talent for business. His mind was not quick,
  but it was powerful, and he used to burrow his way like a mole to the bottom
  of a question. Also there was something about his stability and force of
  character which made men instinctively trust him, and he earned that
  reputation for judgement the price of which is above rubies. No one called
  him clever, but everyone believed him to be wise. In three years he was a
  junior partner in his firm, and after that his advance was rapid. He became a
  director of the Bank of England, the youngest man, I believe, except Goschen,
  who ever entered the Bank Parlour; he sat on more than one Government
  Commission, and he was believed to be often consulted by the Treasury. He
  figured also in the public eye as an athlete, for he played his favourite
  court-tennis regularly, and had been twice runner-up for the amateur
  championship.</p>

  <p>Then into his orderly life, like a warm spring wind upon a snowfield, came
  Pamela Brune. Pamela was my god-daughter, and I had watched with amazement
  her pass from a plain, solemn child to a leggy girl and then to the prettiest
  debutante of her year. Almost in a moment, it seemed to me, the lines of her
  body changed from angularity to grace, the contours of her small face were
  moulded into exquisiteness, and her thin little neck became a fit setting for
  her lovely head. She was tall for a woman, nearly as tall as Charles, but so
  perfectly proportioned that her height did not take the eye; exquisiteness
  was the dominant impression, and a kind of swift airy vigour. In her
  colouring she had taken after her father, and I can best describe it as a
  delicate ivory lit up, as it were, from within, and nobly framed by her dusky
  hair. Her eyes were grey, with blue lights in them. Beyond doubt a beauty,
  and of a rare type. The transformation in her manner was not less striking.
  She had been a shy child, rather silent and reflective, a good companion on a
  long walk, when she would expound to me her highly original fancies, but apt
  at most times to escape notice. Now she was so brilliant to look at that such
  escape was not for her, and she had developed a manner which was at once
  defiant and defensive. Young men were a little afraid of her, her eyes were
  so compelling, taking in much and revealing little, and her deep voice had a
  disquieting candour.</p>

  <p>Charles fell headlong in love, and I could see from the start that the
  affair would not go smoothly. To begin with, she was very
  young&mdash;scarcely nineteen&mdash;and was like a bird preening her wings
  for flight, whereas Charles was thirty-five and fixed solidly on his perch.
  He was a little set in his ways and cocksure in his opinions, while she had
  the sceptical and critical innocence of youth. They became friends at once,
  but their friendship seemed slow to ripen into anything deeper. Pamela had
  nothing of the flirt in her, and though young men swarmed round her, there
  was no other suitor to give Charles heart-disease. The trouble was that he
  got no farther forward. One reason, perhaps, was that he was far too
  eligible. The girl had a notion that everyone desired the match, and that her
  parents counted on it, so naturally she revolted. Another thing&mdash;she was
  quicker-witted than Charles, and had a dozen interests to his one, so that
  his circumscription was apt to show up poorly in contrast. This was bad for
  him, for it cast him into a kind of irritable despair, and bad for Pamela,
  since it made her more critical. When he was schoolmasterish, the pupil put
  him to shame; when his mood was humble, hers was arrogant.</p>

  <p>So during the month before the Flambard party the course of true love did
  not run smooth. The effect of a grand passion on Charles's tough solidity was
  what might have been looked for. His nature was not elastic, and instead of
  expanding under heat was in danger of warping. He was so desperately in love
  that all his foundations were upset. He could not fit his passion into his
  scheme of life, so his scheme of life went by the board. He was miserably
  conscious of being in a world which he did not understand, of dealing with
  imponderable things over which he had no mastery. A hasty word, a cold glance
  from Pamela would thrust this man, who had always prided himself upon his
  balance, into a fever of indecision...</p>

  <p>And just before Whitsuntide they had had something like a quarrel. He had
  been magisterial and she had been pert&mdash; no, "pert" is not the
  word&mdash;rather disdainful in a silken way, airily detached and infinitely
  distant. She had not sulked&mdash;that would have been far easier for
  Charles: she had simply set him back firmly among the ranks of her
  acquaintances. So he had gone to Flambard in a wretched state of mind, and
  her treatment of him there had been like an acid to his wounds. He found
  himself in a condition which he had never dreamed of&mdash;cut off from the
  common-sense world which he understood, and condemned to flounder among
  emotions and problems as evasive as dreams and yet with a terrible potency of
  torture. Moe was right: Charles Ottery was profoundly unhappy.</p><br>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p>He had entered upon the experiment at Flambard with a vague hope that he
  might learn something about the future which would ease his mind. What he did
  learn was that in a year's time he would be dead.</p>

  <p>His first reaction was anger. For four years he had faced the daily
  possibility, even the likelihood, of death. Now, if during those years anyone
  had prophesied his certain death at a certain time, he would have assaulted
  the prophet. That kind of thing was a breach of the unwritten rules of the
  game: one had to pretend to one's self and to the world that one would
  continue to live: it was the assumption which alone made war endurable.
  Therefore Charles Ottery's first feeling was wrathful and contemptuous. The
  Professor was dead; otherwise he would have had something to say to him.</p>

  <p>This mood lasted perhaps two days&mdash;no longer. Gradually it dawned on
  his mind that this was a revelation altogether outside the control of the
  human will. He had believed completely in Moe, and he had seen The Times
  announcement with a blinding clarity which precluded the idea of a mistake.
  Pamela had shaken him out of his old world, and now he had fallen into a far
  stranger one, altogether beyond the kindly uses of humanity. He tried to be
  sceptical, but he had never had much gift for scepticism. Critical in any
  serious sense he could not be, for he had not the apparatus for criticism.
  Anger was succeeded by a fear which was almost panic. Charles was a notably
  brave man, and his courage had been well disciplined and tested. He had
  always been perfectly willing to run risks, and, if need be, to face death
  with his eyes open. But this was different&mdash;this undefined but certain
  fate towards which he must walk for the next twelve months. He discovered
  that he passionately wanted to live. Pamela had dropped out of his thoughts,
  for she was now utterly beyond him&mdash;a doomed man could not be a
  lover&mdash;but his passion for her had enriched and deepened the world for
  him and therefore increased his love of life.</p>

  <p>The first panic passed, and Charles forced himself into a kind of
  stoicism. Not scepticism, for he could not disbelieve, but a resolution to
  face up to whatever was in store. He felt hideously lonely, for not only was
  he too proud to confide in anyone, but he could think of no mortal man who
  had ever been in a like predicament. If he could have discovered a parallel
  case, past or present, he would have been comforted. So since there was no
  one to whom he could unburden his soul, he started to keep a diary... I was
  not at this time in his confidence, but I have had the use of that diary in
  telling this story. In it he put down notes of his daily doings and of his
  state of mind, together with any thoughts that seemed to him cheering or
  otherwise. It is a scrappy and often confused record, but very illuminating,
  for he was honest with himself.</p>

  <p>His first duty was to keep a stout face to the world, and therefore he
  must try to forget The Times paragraph in violent preoccupations. He could
  not face the society of his fellows, so he went little into the City, but he
  strove to crowd his life with intense activities. He practised his
  court-tennis for several hours each day, played a good deal of golf, and took
  to keeping a six-tonner on Southampton Water and making weekend expeditions
  along the coast. From the diary it appeared that this last pursuit was the
  best aid to forgetfulness, so long as the weather was bad. In a difficult
  wind he had to concentrate all his faculties on managing the boat, but when
  there was no such need, he found the deck of his little yacht too conducive
  to painful meditation.</p>

  <p>Presently he realised that these anodynes were no manner of good. Each
  spell of freedom from thought was succeeded by a longer spell of intense
  brooding. He had found no philosophy to comfort him, and no super-induced
  oblivion lasted long. So he decided that he must seek a different kind of
  life. He had an idea that if he went into the wilds he might draw courage
  from the primeval Nature which was all uncertainties and hazards. So in
  August he set off for Newfoundland alone, to hunt the migratory caribou.</p>

  <p>Purposely he gave himself a rough trip. He went up-country to the Terra
  Nova district, and then with two guides penetrated far into the marshes and
  barrens of the interior. He limited his equipment to the bare necessaries,
  and courted every kind of fatigue. He must have taken a good many risks in
  his river journey, for I heard from a man who followed his tracks for the
  brief second season in October that his guides had sworn never again to
  accompany such a madman. You see, he knew for certain that nothing could kill
  him for many months. The diary, written up at night in his chilly camps, told
  the story fully. He got with ease the number of stags permitted by his
  licence&mdash; all of them good beasts&mdash;for, since he did not care a
  straw whether he killed or not, he found that he could not miss. But the
  interesting things were his thoughts, as they came to him while watching in
  the dusk by a half-frozen pond, or lying awake in his sleeping-bag looking at
  the cold stars.</p>

  <p>He had begun to reflect on the implications of death, a subject to which
  he had never given much heed before. His religion was of the ordinary
  public-school brand, the fundamentals of Christianity accepted without much
  comprehension. There was an after-world, of course, about which a man did not
  greatly trouble himself: the important thing, the purpose of religion, was to
  have a decent code of conduct in the present one. But now the latter did not
  mean much to him, since his present life would soon be over... There were
  pages of the diary filled with odd amateurish speculations about God and
  Eternity, and once or twice there was even a kind of prayer. But somewhere in
  the barrens Charles seems to have decided that he had better let metaphysics
  alone. What concerned him was how to pass the next eight months without
  disgracing his manhood. He noted cases of people he had known who, when their
  death sentence was pronounced by their doctor, had lived out the remainder of
  their days with a stiff lip, even with cheerfulness.</p>

  <p>The conclusion of this part of the diary, written before he sailed for
  home, seems to have been that all was lost but honour. He was like a man on a
  sinking ship, and owed it to himself to go down with fortitude. There were no
  entries during the voyage from St John's, so the presumption is that this
  resolve gave him a certain peace.</p>

  <p>That peace did not survive his return to England. He went back to the
  City, where he was badly needed, for the bottom was falling out of business.
  But he seemed unable to concentrate on his work. The sight of his familiar
  surroundings, his desks, his clerks, the business talks which assumed the
  continuity of life, the necessity of making plans which would not mature
  before the following June, put him into a fever of disquiet. I think that he
  had perhaps overtired himself in Newfoundland, and was physically rather
  unstrung; anyhow, on the plea of health, he again began to absent himself
  from his work. He felt that he must discover an anodyne to thought, or go
  mad.</p>

  <p>The anodyne he tried was the worst conceivable. Charles had never led the
  life of pleasure, and had no relish for it; so now, when he attempted it, it
  was like brandy to a teetotaller. He belonged to Dillon's, and took to
  frequenting that club, and playing cards for high stakes. Now, it is a
  dangerous thing to gamble if you have the mania for it in your blood, but it
  is more dangerous if your object is to blanket your mind. He won a good deal
  of money and lost a good deal, and he played with a cold intensity which
  rather scared his partners... Also he, who had always been abstemious, took
  to doing himself too well. I met him one night in St James's Street, and got
  the impression that the sober Charles was rather drunk... Then there was
  hunting. He had not had time for years to do much of that, but now he kept
  horses at Birkham, and went out twice a week. He behaved as he had behaved in
  the Terra Nova rapids, and took wild risks because he believed that nothing
  could harm him. For a couple of months he rode so hard that he made himself a
  nuisance in the field... Then his confidence suddenly deserted him.</p>

  <p>It occurred to him that any day he might have a smash, and linger
  bed-ridden till the following June. So he got rid of his hunters and fled
  from Birkham.</p>

  <p>The result of all this was that before Christmas he had begun to get for
  himself a doubtful name. At first no one believed that this decorous young
  man could run amok, but nobody's repute is iron-clad, and presently too many
  people were ready to surmise the worst. City men reported that he rarely
  showed up at his office, and was useless when he did. Hunting men had tales
  to tell of strange manners in the field and an insane foolhardiness. My
  nephew, who was one of his oldest friends, and belonged to Dillon's, would
  say nothing at first when I asked him about the stories, but in the end he
  admitted reluctantly that they were true. "Charles has got mixed up with a
  poor lot," he said. "Drunken swine like L&mdash;, and half-witted boys like
  little E&mdash;and fine old-fashioned crooks like B&mdash;. He hardly
  recognises me when we meet in the club, for he knows I don't like his bunch.
  In the evening he's apt to be tight after ten o'clock.</p>

  <p>"God knows what's done it!" said my nephew dismally. "Looks as if he
  weren't able to take his corn. Too big a success too soon, you know. Well, he
  won't be a success long... I put it down to a virtuous youth. If you don't
  blow off steam under twenty-five, you're apt to have a blow up later and
  scald yourself... No, I don't think it is unrequited affection. I've heard
  that yarn, but I don't believe it. I saw Lady Pam at a dinner last week, and
  she had a face like a death's head. She's going the pace a bit herself, but
  she's not enjoying it. Whoever is behaving badly, it ain't her. My notion is
  that Charles hasn't given the girl a thought for months. Don't ask me for an
  explanation. Something has snapped in him, the way a racehorse goes suddenly
  wrong."</p>

  <p>I confess that at the time I was more anxious about my goddaughter than
  about Charles. I knew him fairly well and liked him, but Pamela was very near
  my heart. I could not blame him, for it was she who had hitherto caused the
  trouble, but now it was very clear that things were not well with her... She
  had refused to pay her usual Scots visits, and had gone off with the Junipers
  to their place on the Riviera. The Juniper girl had only been an
  acquaintance, but she suddenly blossomed into a bosom friend. Now, the
  Junipers were not too well regarded by old-fashioned people. Tom and Mollie
  Nantley hated the business, but they had always made it a rule never to
  interfere with their daughters, and certainly up to now Pamela had deserved
  their confidence. It must have been gall and wormwood to them to see the
  papers full of pictures of the Juniper doings, with Pamela bathing and
  playing tennis and basking on the sands in the most raffish society... After
  that she went on a cruise to the Red Sea with some Americans called Baffin.
  The Nantleys knew very little about the Baffins, so they hoped for the best;
  but from what I learned afterwards the company on the yacht was pretty
  mixed&mdash;a journalistic peer, two or three financiers, and a selection of
  amorous and alcoholic youth.</p>

  <p>Pamela returned to England before the end of November. The family always
  stayed on at Wirlesdon till well into the new year, but she insisted on
  taking up her quarters in London. She acted in several entertainments got up
  for charity, and became the darling of the illustrated press. I saw her once
  in December, at a dinner given for a ball, and was glad that Mollie Nantley
  was not present. The adorable child that I had known had not altogether gone,
  but it was overlaid with tragic affectations. She had ruined her perfect
  colouring with cosmetics, and her manner had acquired the shrill vulgarity
  which was then the fashion. She was as charming to me as ever, but in her air
  there was a curious defiance. Her face had been made up to look pert, but in
  repose it was tragic. I realised that it was all a desperate bravado to
  conceal suffering.</p><br>

  <h3>III</h3>

  <p>Lamancha had a Christmas party at his house in Devonshire, and I went
  there on the twenty-seventh. After tea my hostess took me aside.</p>

  <p>"We've made an awful gaffe," she said. "Charles Ottery is here, and I find
  to my horror that Pamela Brune is coming tomorrow. I can't very well put her
  off, but you know that things have not been going well with her and Charles,
  and their being together may be very painful for both of them."</p>

  <p>I asked if Charles knew that Pamela was coming.</p>

  <p>"I told him this morning, but he didn't seem interested. I hoped he would
  discover that he had an engagement elsewhere, but not a bit of it&mdash;he
  only looked blank and turned away. What on earth has happened to him, Ned? He
  is rather quarrelsome, when he isn't simply deadly dull, and he has such
  queer moping moods. There is something on his mind, and I don't believe that
  it's Pamela."</p>

  <p>"Couldn't you let her know he is here?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"I wired to Mollie Nantley, but the only reply I got was about Pamela's
  train. She is evidently coming with her eyes open."</p>

  <p>Pamela duly arrived during the following afternoon, when we were out
  shooting Lamancha's hedgerow pheasants. I did not see her till dinner, and I
  had to go off at dawn next morning to London for an unexpected consultation.
  But that evening I had a very dear and most disquieting impression of her and
  Charles. Her manner was shrill and rather silly; she seemed to be acting a
  part which was utterly unsuited to her kind of beauty and to her character as
  I had known it. The house-party was not exciting, only pleasant and friendly,
  and she succeeded in making us all uncomfortable. I did not see her first
  meeting with Charles, but that evening she never looked at him, nor he at
  her. He drank rather too much wine at dinner, and afterwards played bezique
  owlishly in the smoking-room. I had tried to get a word with him, but he
  shunned me like the plague.</p>

  <p>What happened after I left I learned from the diary. Behind the mask he
  had been deeply miserable, for the sight of the girl had brought back his old
  happier world. He realised that far down below all his anxieties lay his love
  for her&mdash;that indeed this love was subconsciously the cause of his
  frantic clutch on life. He had tried stoicism and had failed; he had tried
  drugging himself by excitement into forgetfulness and had failed not less
  dismally. Pamela's presence seemed to recall him to his self-respect. He did
  not notice any change in her&mdash;his eyes had been too long looking inward
  to be very observant: he only knew that the woman who had once lit up his
  life was now for ever beyond him&mdash;worse still, that he had dropped to a
  level from which he could not look at her without shame. He fell into a mood
  of bitter abasement, which was far healthier than his previous desperation,
  for he was thinking now less of the death which was in store for him than of
  the code of honourable living to which he had been false.</p>

  <p>That night he slept scarcely a wink, and next morning he did not show up
  at breakfast. He told the servant who called him that he was going for a long
  walk, and slipped out of the house before anybody was down. He felt that he
  had to be alone to wrestle with his soul.</p>

  <p>The diary told something of his misery that day on the high Devon moors.
  The weather was quiet and tonic with a touch of frost, and he walked blindly
  over the uplands. Charles was too stiff-backed a fellow to indulge in
  self-pity, but his type is apt to be a prey to self-contempt. He can have
  seen nothing of the bright landscape, for he was enveloped in a great
  darkness&mdash;regrets, remorse, a world of wrath with the horror of a deeper
  shade looming before him. He struggled to regain the captaincy of his soul,
  but he had no longer the impulse to strive, since he seemed to himself to
  have already foresworn his standards. There was nothing before him but a
  dreadful, hopeless passivity, what the Bible calls an "awful looking-for of
  judgement." The hours of spiritual torment and rapid movement wore down his
  strength, and in the afternoon he found that he was very weary. So he walked
  slowly homeward, having dulled his bodily and mental senses but won no
  comfort.</p>

  <p>In the dusk, at the head of one of the grassy rides in the home woods, as
  the fates ordained it, he met Pamela. She, unhappy also, had fled from the
  house for a little air and solitude. Both were so full of their own thoughts
  that they might have passed without recognition had they not encountered each
  other at a gate. Charles opened it, and held it wide for the stranger to
  pass, and it was the speaking of his name that enlightened him as to the
  personality of the stranger.</p>

  <p>"Good evening, Captain Ottery," Pamela said.</p>

  <p>He started and stared at her. Something in his appearance held her eyes,
  for a man does not go through hell without showing it. In those eyes there
  must have been wonder; there must have been pity too. He saw it, dulled
  though his senses were, and perhaps he saw also some trace of that suffering
  which I had noticed in London, for the girl was surprised and had no time to
  don her mask.</p>

  <p>"Pamela!" he cried, and then his strength seemed to go from him, and he
  leaned heavily on the gate, so that his shoulder touched hers.</p>

  <p>She drew back. "You are ill?"</p>

  <p>He recovered himself. "No, not ill," he said. He could say no more, for
  when a man has been wrestling all day with truth he cannot easily lie.</p>

  <p>She put a hand on his arm. "But you look so ill and strange."</p>

  <p>And then some of the old tenderness must have come into her eyes and
  voice. "Oh, Charles," she cried, "what has happened to us?"</p>

  <p>It was the word "us" that broke him down, for it told him that she too was
  at odds with life. He had a sudden flash of illumination. He saw that what he
  had once longed for was true, that her heart was his, and the realisation
  that not only life but love was lost to him was the last drop in his cup. He
  stood holding the gate, shaking like a reed, with eyes which, even in the
  half-light, seemed to be devoured with pain.</p>

  <p>"You must have thought me a cad," he stammered. "I love you&mdash;I loved
  you beyond the world, but I dared not come near you... I am a dying man... I
  will soon be dead."</p>

  <p>His strength came back to him. He had a purpose now. He had found the only
  mortal in whom he could confide&mdash;must confide.</p>

  <p>As they walked down the ride in the winter gloaming, with the happy lights
  of the house in the valley beneath them, he told her all, and as he spoke it
  seemed to him that he was cleansing his soul. She made no comment&mdash;did
  not utter a single word.</p>

  <p>At the gate of the terrace gardens he stopped. His manner was normal
  again, and his voice was quiet, almost matter-of-fact.</p>

  <p>"Thank you for listening to me, Pamela," he said. "It has been a great
  comfort to me to tell you this... It is the end for both of us. You see that,
  don't you?... We must never meet again. Goodbye, my dear."</p>

  <p>He took her hand, and the touch of it shivered his enforced composure. "I
  love you... I love you," he moaned...</p>

  <p>She snatched her hand away.</p>

  <p>"This is perfect nonsense," she said. "I won't... " and then fled down an
  alley, as she had once fled from me at Flambard.</p>

  <p>Charles had some food in his room, and went to bed, where he slept for the
  first time for weeks. He had been through the extremes of hell, and nothing
  worse could await him. The thought gave him a miserable peace. He wrote a
  line to his hostess, and left for London by the early train.</p><br>

  <h3>IV</h3>

  <p>He was sitting next afternoon in his rooms in Mount Street when a lady was
  announced, and Pamela marched in on the heels of his servant. The room was in
  dusk, and it was her voice that revealed her to him.</p>

  <p>"Turn on the light, Crocker," she said briskly, "and bring tea for two. As
  quick as possible, please, for I'm famishing."</p>

  <p>I can picture her, for I know Pamela's ways, plucking off her hat and
  tossing it on to a table, shaking up the cushions on the big sofa, and
  settling herself in a corner of it&mdash;Pamela no longer the affected miss
  of recent months, but the child of April and an April wind, with the
  freshness of a spring morning about her.</p>

  <p>They had tea, for which the anxious Crocker provided muffins, rejoicing to
  see once again in the flat people feeding like Christians. Pamela chattered
  happily, chiefly gossip about Wirlesdon, while Charles pulled himself out of
  his lethargy and strove to rise to her mood. He even went to his bedroom,
  changed his collar and brushed his hair. When Crocker had cleared away the
  tea, she made him light his pipe. "You know you are never really happy with
  anything else," she said; and he obeyed, not having smoked a pipe since
  Newfoundland.</p>

  <p>"Now," she said at last, when she had poked the fire into a blaze, "I want
  you to repeat very carefully all that rubbish you told me yesterday."</p>

  <p>He obeyed&mdash;told the story slowly and dispassionately, without the
  emotion of the previous day. She listened carefully, and wrote down from his
  dictation the exact words he had read in The Times. She knitted her brows
  over them. "Pretty accurate, aren't they?" she asked. "Not much chance of
  mistaken identity."</p>

  <p>"None," he said. "There are very few Otterys in the world, and every
  detail about me is correct."</p>

  <p>"And you believe in it?"</p>

  <p>"I must."</p>

  <p>"I mean to say, you believe that you really saw that thing in The Times?
  You didn't dream it afterwards?"</p>

  <p>"I saw it as clearly as I am seeing you."</p>

  <p>"I wondered what tricks that old Professor man was up to at Flambard, but
  I had no notion it was anything as serious as this. What do you suppose the
  others saw? Uncle Ned is sure to know&mdash;I'll ask him."</p>

  <p>"He saw nothing himself&mdash;he told me so. Lady Flambard fainted, and he
  was looking after her."</p>

  <p>"She saw nothing either, then? I'm sorry, for I can't ask any of the men.
  I don't know Mr Tavanger or Mr Mayot or Sir Robert Goodeve, and Reggie Daker
  is too much of a donkey to count. It would be too delicate a subject to be
  inquisitive about with strangers... You really are convinced that the
  Professor had got hold of some method of showing you the future?"</p>

  <p>"Convinced beyond any possibility of doubt," said Charles dismally.</p>

  <p>"Good. That settles one thing... Now for the next point. The fact that you
  saw that stuff is no reason why it should happen. Supposing you had dreamed
  it, would you have allowed a dream, however vivid, to wreck your life?"</p>

  <p>"But, Pamela dear, the case is quite different. Moe showed us what he
  called 'objective reality.' A dream would have been my own concern, but this
  came from outside, quite independent of any effort of mine. It was the result
  of a scientific experiment."</p>

  <p>"But the science may have been all cock-eyed. Most science is&mdash;at any
  rate, it changes a good deal faster than Paris fashions."</p>

  <p>"You wouldn't have said that if you had been under his influence. He
  didn't want me to die&mdash;he didn't make The Times paragraph take that
  form&mdash;he only lifted the curtain an inch so that I could see what had
  actually happened a year ahead. How can I disbelieve what science brought to
  me out of space, without any preparation or motive? The whole thing was as
  mathematical and impersonal as an eclipse of the moon in an almanack."</p>

  <p>"All right! Let's leave it at that. Assume that The Times is going to
  print the paragraph. The answer is that The Times is going to be badly
  diddled. Somebody will make a bloomer."</p>

  <p>Charles shook his head. "I've tried to think that, but well&mdash;you
  know, that kind of mistake isn't made."</p>

  <p>"Oh, isn't it? The papers announced Dollie's engagement to three different
  men&mdash;exact as you please&mdash;names and dates complete."</p>

  <p>"But why should it make a blunder in this one case out of millions? Isn't
  it more reasonable to think that there is a moral certainty of its being
  right?"</p>

  <p>Pamela was not succeeding with her arguments. They sounded thin to her own
  ears, in spite of her solid conviction at the back of them. She sat up, an
  alert, masterful figure, youth girt for command. She had another appeal than
  logic.</p>

  <p>"Charles," she said solemnly, "this is a horrible business for you, and
  you've got to pull yourself together. You must defy it. Make up your mind
  that you're not going to give it another thought. Get back to your work, and
  resolve that you don't care a lop-eared damn for Moe or science or anything
  else. Lose your temper with fate and frighten the blasted hussy." Tom Nantley
  had a turn for robust speech in the hunting-field, and his daughter
  remembered some of it.</p>

  <p>Charles shook his head miserably.</p>

  <p>"I've tried," he said, "but I can't. I simply haven't the manhood... I
  know it's the right way, but my mind is poisoned already. I've got a germ in
  it that fevers me... Besides, it isn't sense. You can't stop what is to be by
  saying that it won't be."</p>

  <p>"Yes, you can," said the girl firmly. "That's the meaning of Free
  Will."</p>

  <p>Charles dropped his head into his hands. The sight of Pamela thus restored
  to him was more than he could bear.</p>

  <p>Then she had an inspiration.</p>

  <p>"Do you remember the portrait in the dining-room at Wirlesdon of old Sir
  Somebody-Ap-Something&mdash;Mamma's Welsh ancestor? You know the story about
  him? He was on the side of Henry Tudor, and raised his men to march to
  Bosworth. But every witch and warlock in Carmarthen got on to their hindlegs
  and prophesied&mdash;said they saw him in a bloody shroud, and heard banshees
  wailing for him, and how Merlin had said that when the Ap-Something red and
  gold crossed Severn to join the Tudor green and white it would be the end of
  the race&mdash;all manner of cheery omens. Everybody in the place believed
  them, including his lady wife, who wept buckets and clung to his knees. What
  did the old sportsman do? Told all the warlocks to go to the devil, and
  marched gaily eastward, leaving his wife sewing his shroud and preparing the
  family vault."</p>

  <p>"What happened?" Charles had lifted his head.</p>

  <p>"Happened? He turned the day at Bosworth, set the Tudor on the throne, got
  the Garter for his services&mdash;you see it in the portrait&mdash;and about
  half South Wales. He and his men came merrily home, and he lived till he was
  ninety-three. There's an example for you!"</p>

  <p>Pamela warmed to her argument.</p>

  <p>"That sort of thing happened all the time in the old days. Whenever
  anybody had a down on you he got a local soothsayer to prophesy death and
  disaster in case you might believe it and lose your nerve. And if you had
  been having a row with the Church, some priest or bishop had an unpleasant
  vision about you. What was the result? Timid people took to their beds and
  died of fright, which was what the soothsayers wanted. Bold men like my
  ancestor paid not the slightest attention, and nothing happened&mdash;except
  that, when they got a chance, they outed the priest and hanged the
  soothsayer."</p>

  <p>Charles was listening keenly.</p>

  <p>"But the soothsayers were often right," he objected.</p>

  <p>"They were just as often wrong. The point is, that there were men brave
  enough to defy them&mdash;as you are going to do."</p>

  <p>"But the cases aren't the same," he protested. "That was ordinary vulgar
  magic, with a personal grudge behind it. I'm up against the last word in
  impersonal science."</p>

  <p>"My dear Charles," she said sweetly, "you've let your brains go to seed. I
  never knew you miss a point before. Magic and astrology and that kind of
  thing were all the science the Middle Ages had, and they believed in them
  just as firmly as you believe in Moe. The point is that, in spite of their
  belief, there were people bold enough to defy it&mdash;and to win, as you are
  going to do. A thousand years hence the world may think of Moe and Einstein
  and all those pundits as babyish as we think the old necromancers. Beliefs
  change, but courage is always the same. Courage is the line for you, my
  dear."</p>

  <p>At last she had moved him. There was a light in his eyes as he looked at
  her, perplexed and broken, but still a light.</p>

  <p>"You think... " he began, but she broke in...</p>

  <p>"I think that you're face to face with a crisis, Charles dear. Fate has
  played you an ugly trick, but you're man enough to beat it. It's like the
  thing in the Bible about Jacob wrestling with the angel. You've got to
  wrestle with it, and if you wrestle hard enough it may bless you."</p>

  <p>Her voice had lost its briskness, and had become soft and wooing. She
  jumped up from the sofa and came round behind his chair, as if she did not
  want him to see her face.</p>

  <p>"I refuse to give another thought to the silly thing," she said. "We are
  going to behave as if Moe had never been born." Her hand was caressing his
  hair.</p>

  <p>"But YOU are not condemned to death," he said.</p>

  <p>"Oh, am I not?" she cried. "It's frightfully important for me. On June
  tenth of next year I shall be starting on my honeymoon."</p>

  <p>That fetched him out of his chair.</p>

  <p>He gazed blindly at her as she stood with her cheeks flushed and her eyes
  a little dim. For a full minute he strove for words and none came.</p>

  <p>"Have you nothing to say?" she whispered. "Do you realise, sir, that I am
  asking you to marry me?"</p><br>

  <h3>V</h3>

  <p>It was now that I entered the story. Mollie Nantley came to Town and
  summoned me to a family conclave. She and Tom were in a mood between delight
  and anxiety.</p>

  <p>"You got my wire?" she asked. "The announcement will be in the papers
  tomorrow. But they are not to be married till June. Too long to wait&mdash;I
  don't like these long engagements."</p>

  <p>"You are pleased?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Tremendously&mdash;in a way. But we don't quite know what to think. They
  never saw each other for six months, and then it all came with a rush. Pam
  has been rather odd lately, you know, and Tom and I have been very worried.
  We saw that she was unhappy, and we thought that it might be about Charles.
  And Charles's behaviour has been something more than odd&mdash;so odd that
  Tom was in two minds about consenting to the engagement. You know how fond we
  were of him and how we believed in him, but his conduct before Christmas was
  rather shattering. You are too busy to hear gossip, but I can assure you that
  Charles has been the most talked-of man in London. Not pleasant gossip
  either."</p>

  <p>"But the explanation seems quite simple," I said. "Two estranged lovers,
  both proud and both miserable and therefore rather desperate. Chance brings
  them together, misunderstandings disappear, and true love comes into its
  own."</p>

  <p>Mollie bent her brows.</p>

  <p>"It's not as simple as that. If that had been the way of things they ought
  to be riotously happy. But they're not&mdash; not in the least. Pam is as
  white as a sheet, and looks more like a widow than a bride. She's very sweet
  and good&mdash;very different from before Christmas, when she was horribly
  tiresome&mdash;but you never saw such careworn eyes. She has something heavy
  on her mind... And as for Charles! He is very good too and goes steadily to
  the City again, but he's not my notion of the happy lover. Tom and I are at
  our wits' end. I do wish you would have a talk with Pamela. She won't tell me
  anything&mdash;I really don't dare to ask&mdash;but you and she have always
  been friends, and if there is any trouble you might help her."</p>

  <p>So Pamela came to tea with me, and the first sight of her told me that
  Mollie was right. In a week or two some alchemy had changed her utterly. Not
  a trace now of that hard, mirthless glitter which had scared me at the
  Lamanchas'. Her face was pale, her air quiet and composed, but there was in
  her eyes what I had seen in Charles Ottery's, an intense, anxious
  preoccupation.</p>

  <p>She told me everything without pressing. She could not tell her parents,
  she said, for they would not understand, and, if they did, their sympathy
  would make things worse. But she longed for someone to confide in, and had
  decided on me.</p>

  <p>I saw that it would be foolish to make light of the trouble. Indeed, I had
  no inclination that way, for I had seen the tortures that Goodeve was
  undergoing. She told me what she had said to Charles, and the line they were
  taking. I remember wondering if the man had the grit to go through with it;
  when I looked at Pamela's clear eyes I had no doubt about the woman.</p>

  <p>"He has gone back to his business and has forced himself to slave at it.
  He is crowding up his days with work. And he is keeping himself in hard
  training... You see, he has tried the other dopes and found them no good...
  But he has to fight every step of the road. Oh, Uncle Ned, I could howl with
  misery sometimes when I see him all drawn at the lips and hollow about the
  eyes. He doesn't sleep well, you see. But he is fighting, and not yielding
  one inch."</p>

  <p>And then she quoted to me her saying about Jacob wrestling with the angel.
  "If we keep on grappling with the brute, it MUST bless us."</p>

  <p>"I have to hold his hand all the time," she went on. "That's his hope of
  salvation. He is feeding on my complete confidence... Oh no, it's not easy,
  but it's easier than his job. I've to pretend to be perfectly certain that
  we'll be married next June tenth, and to be always talking about where we
  shall go for our honeymoon, and where we shall live in Town, and how we shall
  do up Marlcote."</p>

  <p>She smiled wanly.</p>

  <p>"I chatter about hotels and upholsterers and house-agents when I want to
  be praying... But I think I understand my part. I have a considerable patch
  of hell to plough, but it's nothing like as hot as Charles's... No, you can't
  help, Uncle Ned, dear. We have to go through with this thing
  ourselves&mdash;we two&mdash; nobody else. Charles must never know that I
  have told you, for if he thought that anyone else knew it would add shyness
  to his trouble... But it's a comfort to me to feel that you know. If anything
  happens... if we fail... I want you to realise that we went down
  fighting."</p>

  <p>She kissed me and ran away, and I sat thinking a long time in my chair.
  She was right: no one could help these two through this purgatory. My heart
  ached for this child not out of her teens who was trying to lift her lover
  through the Slough of Despond by her sheer courage. I do not think that I
  have ever in my life so deeply admired a fellow-mortal. Pamela was the very
  genius of fortitude, courage winged and inspired and divinely lit... I told
  myself that such a spirit could not fail if there was a God in Heaven.</p>

  <p>I can only guess at what Charles suffered in the first months of the year.
  The diary revealed something, but not much, for the entries were scrappy: you
  see, he was not fighting the battle alone, as he had done in the autumn; he
  had Pamela for his guide and confessor.</p>

  <p>He stuck like a leech to his work, and from all accounts did it well. My
  nephew said that old Charles had "taken a pull on himself, but had become a
  cheerless bird." People in the City, when I asked about him, were cordial
  enough. He had been put on a new economic commission at which he was working
  hard. One man said that his examination of a high Treasury official was one
  of the most searching things he had ever heard. Our financial affairs at that
  time were in a considerable mess, and Charles was bending all his powers to
  straightening them out.</p>

  <p>It was much to have got his brain functioning again. But of course it did
  not mean the recovery of his old interests. He had only one
  interest&mdash;how to keep his head up till June, and one absorbing
  desire&mdash;to be with Pamela. The girl gave him more than the sustenance of
  her confidence; there were hours when the love of her so filled his mind that
  it drove out the gnawing pain, and that meant hours of rest. As sleep
  restores the body, so these spells of an almost happy absorption restored his
  spirit.</p>

  <p>But he had patches of utter blackness, as the diary showed. He held
  himself firm to his resolution by a constant effort of will. He could not
  despair when Pamela kept her courage... But he would waver at moments, and
  only recover himself out of shame. There were times, too, when he bitterly
  reproached himself. He had brought an innocent child into his tortured world,
  and made her share in the tortures. Another life besides his own would be
  ruined. Out of such fits of self-contempt he had to be dragged painfully by
  Pamela's affection. She had to convince him anew that she preferred Tophet in
  his company to Paradise alone.</p>

  <p>In March Pamela told me that she had offered to marry him at once, and
  that he had refused. He was on his probation, he said, and marriage was to be
  the reward of victory. Also, if he was to be in the grave on June tenth, he
  did not want Pamela to be a widow. The girl argued, she told me, that
  immediate marriage would be an extra defiance to Fate, and a proof of their
  confidence, but Charles was adamant. I dare say he was right: he had to
  settle such a question with his own soul.</p>

  <p>I met him occasionally during those months. Never in ordinary society: by
  a right instinct Pamela and he decided that they could not go about together
  and be congratulated&mdash;that would make too heavy demands on their powers
  of camouflage. But I ran across him several times in the street; and I sat
  next to him at a luncheon given by the Prime Minister to the American Debt
  Commission. Knowing the story, I looked for changes in him, and I noted
  several things which were probably hidden from other people. He had begun to
  speak rather slowly, as if he had difficulty in finding the correct words. He
  did not look an interlocutor in the face, but fixed his eyes, while he spoke,
  steadily on the tablecloth. Also, though his colour was healthy, his skin
  seemed to be drawn too tight around his lips and chin, reminding me of a
  certain Army Commander during the bad time in '18.</p>

  <p>I asked about Pamela.</p>

  <p>"Yes, she's in Town," he said. "The Nantleys have been up since January.
  She has caught a beastly cold, and I made her promise to stay indoors in this
  bitter weather."</p>

  <p>Two days later I picked up an evening paper and read a paragraph which
  sent me post-haste to the telephone. It announced that Lady Pamela Brune was
  ill with pneumonia, and that anxiety was felt about her condition.</p><br>

  <h3>VI</h3>

  <p>The diary told the tale of the next three weeks. Charles had to return to
  his diary, for he had no other confidant. And a stranger story I have never
  read.</p>

  <p>From the first he was certain that Pamela would die. He was quite clear
  about this, and he had also become assured of his own end. Their love was to
  be blotted out by the cold hand of death. For a day or two he was in a stupor
  of utter hopelessness, waiting on fate like a condemned man who hears the
  gallows being hammered together and sees the clock moving towards the
  appointed hour.</p>

  <p>Some of the entries were clear enough. He thought that Pamela would die at
  once while he himself must wait until June, and there were distraught queries
  as to how he could endure the interval. His appointed hour could not be
  anticipated, and a world without Pamela was a horror which came near to
  unhinging his mind. His writing tailed away into blots and dashes. In his
  agony he seemed several times to have driven his pen through the paper
  ...</p>

  <p>Then suddenly the mist cleared. The diary was nothing but jottings and
  confused reflections, so the sequence of his moods could not be exactly
  traced, but it was plain that something tremendous had happened...</p>

  <p>It seemed to have come suddenly late at night, for he noted the
  hour&mdash;one thirty&mdash;and that he had been walking the Embankment since
  eight. Hitherto he had had a dual consciousness, seeing Pamela and himself as
  sufferers under the same doom, and enduring a double torture. Love and fear
  for both the girl and himself had brought his mind almost to a delirium, but
  now there descended upon it a great clarity.</p>

  <p>The emotion remained, but now the object was single, for his own death
  dropped out of the picture. It became suddenly too small a thing to waste a
  thought on. There were entries like this: "I have torn up the almanack on
  which I had been marking off the days till June tenth... I have been an
  accursed coward, God forgive me... Pamela is dying, and I have been thinking
  of my own wretched, rotten life."</p>

  <p>He went on steadily with his work, because he thought she would have
  wished him to, but he never moved far from a telephone. Meanwhile, the poor
  child was fighting a very desperate battle. I went round to South Audley
  Street as often as I could, and a white-faced Mollie gave me the last
  bulletins. There was one night when it seemed certain that Pamela could not
  see the morning, but morning came and the thread of life still held. She was
  delirious, talking about Charles mostly, and the mountain inn in the Tyrol
  where they were going for their honeymoon. Thank God, Charles was not there
  to listen to that!</p>

  <p>He did not go near the house, which I thought was wise, but the diary
  revealed that he spent the midnight hours striding about Mayfair. He was
  waiting for her death, waiting for Mollie's summons to look for the last time
  upon what was so dear...</p>

  <p>He was no longer in torment. Indeed, he was calm now, if you can call that
  calm which is the uttermost despair. His life was bereft of every shadow of
  value, every spark of colour, and he was living in a bleak desert, looking
  with aching eyes and a breaking heart at a beautiful star setting below the
  sky-line, a star which was the only light in the encroaching gloom to lead
  him home. That very metaphor was in the diary. He probably got it out of some
  hymn, and I never in my life knew Charles use a metaphor before.</p>

  <p>And then there came another change&mdash;it is plain in the
  diary&mdash;but this time it was a wholesale revolution, by which the whole
  man was moved to a different plane...</p>

  <p>His own predestined death had been put aside as too trivial for a thought,
  but now suddenly Death itself came to have no meaning. The ancient shadow
  disappeared in the great brightness of his love.</p>

  <p>Every man has some metaphysics and poetry in his soul, but people like
  Charles lack the gift of expression. The diary had only broken sentences, but
  they were more poignant than any eloquence. If he had cared about the poets
  he might have found some one of them to give him apt words; as it was, he
  could only stumble along among clumsy phrases. But there was no doubt about
  his meaning. He had discovered for himself the immortality of love. The angel
  with whom he had grappled had at last blessed him.</p>

  <p>He had somehow in his agony climbed to a high place from which he had a
  wide prospect. He saw all things in a new perspective. Death was only a
  stumble in the race, a brief halt in an immortal pilgrimage. He and Pamela
  had won something which could never be taken away... This man of prose and
  affairs became a mystic. One side of him went about his daily round, and
  waited hungrily for telephone calls, but the other was in a quiet country
  where Pamela's happy spirit moved in eternal vigour and youth. He had no hope
  in the lesser sense, for that is a mundane thing; but he had won peace, the
  kind that the world does not give...</p>

  <p>Hope, the lesser hope, was to follow. There came a day when the news from
  South Audley Street improved, and then there was a quick uprush of vitality
  in the patient. One morning early in May Mollie telephoned to me that Pamela
  was out of danger. I went straightway to the City and found Charles in his
  office, busy as if nothing had happened.</p>

  <p>I remember that he seemed to me almost indecently composed. But when he
  spoke he no longer kept his eyes down, but looked me straight in the face,
  and there was something in those eyes of his which made me want to shout. It
  was more than peace&mdash; it was a radiant serenity. Charles had come out of
  the Valley of the Shadow to the Delectable Mountains. Nothing in Heaven or
  earth could harm him now. I had the conviction that if he had been a poet he
  could have written something that would have solemnised mankind. As it was,
  he only squeezed my hand.</p><br>

  <h3>VII</h3>

  <p>I went down to Wirlesdon for the wedding, which was to be in the village
  church. Charles had gone for an early morning swim in the lake, and I met him
  coming up with his hair damp and a towel over his shoulder. I had motored
  from London and had The Times in my hand, but he never glanced at it. Half an
  hour later I saw him at breakfast, but he had not raided the pile of
  newspapers on the side-table.</p>

  <p>It was a gorgeous June morning, and presently I found Pamela in the
  garden, busy among the midsummer flowers&mdash;a taller and paler Pamela,
  with the wonderful pure complexion of one who has been down into the
  shades.</p>

  <p>"It's all there," she whispered to me, so that her sister Dollie should
  not hear. "Exactly as he saw it... We shall have a lot of questions to answer
  today... I showed it to Charles, but he scarcely glanced at it. It doesn't
  interest him. I believe he has forgotten all about it."</p>

  <p>"A queer business, wasn't it?" Charles told me in the autumn. "Oh yes, it
  was all explained. There was an old boy of my name, a sort of third cousin of
  my great-grandfather. I had never heard of him. He had been in the Scots
  Guards, and had retired as a captain about fifty years ago. Well, he died in
  a London hotel on June ninth. He was a bachelor, and had no near relations,
  so his servant sent the notice of his death to The Times. The man's
  handwriting was not very clear, and the newspaper people read the age as
  thirty-six instead of eighty-six... Also, the old chap always spoke of his
  regiment as the Scots Fusilier Guards, and the servant, not being well up in
  military history, confused it with the Scots Fusiliers... He lived in a villa
  at Cheltenham, which he had christened Marlcote, after the family place."</p>
