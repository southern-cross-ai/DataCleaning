<p>General Scene</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="#a01">ACT ONE</a>
</p>

<p>The exterior of the homes of the Lights and the Fifes in a small
town in Connecticut. These houses stand side by side, facing front,
on the street. They are separated by narrow strips of lawn, with a
lilac hedge at center marking the boundary-line between the two
properties, and a row of tall maples in the background behind the
yards and the two houses. The Fife house, a small brownish-tinted
modern stucco bungalow type, recently built, is at left; the Light
home, a little old New England white frame cottage with green
shutters, at right. Only the half sections of the two houses are
visible which are nearest to each other, the one containing the
Fife sitting room, with Ramsay's and May's bedroom directly above
it, and the section of the Lights' home in which are their sitting
room and Reuben's bedroom on the floor above.</p>

<p>As the separate scenes require, the front walls of these rooms
are removed to show the different interiors. All these rooms are
small, the ones in the Light home particularly so.</p>

<p>It is the month of May of the present day. The lilacs are in
bloom, the grass is a fresh green.</p>

<h1>ACT ONE</h1>
</center>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>SCENE ONE--<i>It is evening. In the background between the two
houses the outlines of the maples are black against a sky pale with
the light of a quarter-moon. Now and then there is a faint flash of
lightning from far off and a low rumble of thunder.</i></p>

<p><i>The Light sitting room and Reuben's bedroom are revealed.
Both are sparsely furnished with the bare necessities. Reuben's
bedroom contains an old four poster bed, front, facing left, a
small table on which are stacked his textbooks, and a chair in left
corner, front. In the left wall is a window. A washstand with bowl
and pitcher is in the left corner, rear, and an old-fashioned
bureau in the middle of the rear wall. To the right of this is the
door of a clothes closet. The door to the hall and the stairs is at
right, rear. There is a lighted kerosene lamp on the table.</i>
</p>

<p><i>In the sitting room below there is a table at center, front.
The minister's armchair is beside this on the left. His wife's
rocker is at the right of the table. Farther right is another
chair. Three small hooked rugs are on the floor. Several framed
prints of scenes from the Bible hang on the walls. The minister's
small desk is placed against the left wall beside the window. On
the table at center are a cheap oil reading lamp, a Bible, and some
magazines. There is a door to the hall in the right wall, rear.</i>
</p>

<p><i>The ceilings of both rooms are low, the wall paper so faded
that the ugliness of its color and design has been toned down into
a neutral blur. But everything in this home is spotlessly clean and
in order, the old furniture and floors are oiled and polished.</i>
</p>

<p><i>The Reverend Hutchins Light is seated in his armchair, his
wife in her rocker. He is a man in his early sixties, slightly
under medium height, ponderously built. His face is square, ribbed
with wrinkles, the forehead low, the nose heavy, the eyes small and
gray-blue, the reddish hair grizzled and bushy, the stubborn jaw
weakened by a big indecisive mouth. His voice is the bullying one
of a sermonizer who is the victim of an inner uncertainty that
compensates itself by being boomingly overassertive.</i>
</p>

<p><i>His wife, Amelia, is fifteen years his junior and appears
even younger. Her stout figure is still firm and active, with large
breasts and broad, round hips. She must have been pretty as a</i>
<i>girl. Even now her dark-complected face, with its big brown eyes
and wavy black hair, retains its attractiveness although it has
grown fleshy. Her expression is one of virtuous resignation. Only
her mouth is rebellious. It is a thin small mouth, determined and
stubborn.</i></p>

<p><i>In the bedroom above, their son, Reuben, is sitting in his
shirt sleeves on the side of his bed. He is seventeen, tall and
thin. His eyes are large, shy and sensitive, of the same gray-blue
as his father's. His mouth is like his father's. His jaw is
stubborn, his thick hair curly and reddish-blond. He speaks timidly
and hesitatingly, as a much younger boy might. His natural voice
has an almost feminine gentleness. In intercourse with the world,
however, he instinctively imitates his father's tone, booming
self-protectively.</i>
</p>

<p><i>Hutchins Light has a pad on which he has been trying to make
notes for his next sermon, but his mind is abstracted. He stares
before him with the resentful air of one brooding over a wrong done
him and unsuccessfully plotting revenge. His wife is pretending to
read, but her thoughts are actively elsewhere, and she glances
calculatingly at her husband from under lowered lids.</i>
</p>

<p><i>In the bedroom above, Reuben's eyes are turned toward the
window, his face eager with dreams.</i>
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>LIGHT--(<i>arguing tormentedly within himself</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">What did he mean about Reuben? &hellip;
that foul-mouthed scoundrel! &hellip; "Better call in your son or
some night I might mistake his odor of sanctity for a skunk's and
fill his" &hellip; filthy word belching from his grinning mouth!
&hellip; "full of buckshot" &hellip; I heard the corner loafers
laugh &hellip; and I had to slink by and pretend not to hear!
&hellip; If it weren't for my cloth I'd have beaten his face to a
bloody pulp! &hellip; I'd &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>suddenly horrified at himself</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">A murderer's thoughts! &hellip; Lord
God, forgive me! &hellip;</p>

<p>MRS. LIGHT--(<i>glances at him and speaks in a gentle tone that
carries a challenging quality</i>) Hutchins, do you realize Reuben
will graduate from school in less than a month?</p>

<p>LIGHT--(<i>oblivious</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">But, Lord, Thou knowest what a thorn in
the flesh that atheist, Fife, has been since the devil brought him
next door! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>protesting petulantly to his God</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">How long, O Lord? &hellip; does not his
foul ranting begin to try Thy patience? &hellip; is not the time
ripe to smite this blasphemer who defies Thee publicly to strike
him dead? &hellip; Lord God of Hosts, why dost Thou not strike him?
&hellip; If Thou didst, I would proclaim the awful warning of it
over all America! &hellip; I would convert multitudes, as it was
once my dream to do! &hellip;</p>

<p>MRS. LIGHT--Hutchins, please pay attention to what I'm saying.
Don't you think we ought to decide definitely about Reuben's
future?</p>

<p>LIGHT--(<i>turns to her with a frown</i>) I have decided. He
shall follow in my footsteps--mine and those of my father before me
and his father before him. It is God's manifest will! (<i>He
presses his lips tightly together--an effort to appear implacable
that gives his face the expression of a balky animal's.</i>)</p>

<p>MRS. LIGHT--(<i>thinks scornfully</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">He is always so sure of what God wills!
&hellip; but Reuben'll never be a minister if I can prevent it!
&hellip; I'd rather see him dead than go through the poverty and
humiliation I've had to face! &hellip; Reuben's got to go to
college &hellip; then into business &hellip; marry a nice girl with
money &hellip; he doesn't care anything about girls yet, thank
goodness!</p>

<p>(<i>She speaks in a meek, persuasive tone.</i>) Each of us must
judge about Reuben according to the light vouchsafed by God. He
doesn't feel any call to the ministry and I think it would be a
great sin if--</p>

<p>LIGHT--(<i>his voice booming</i>) And I tell you, Amelia, it is
God's will!</p>

<p>REUBEN--(<i>hearing his father's voice, jumps to his feet and
stares down toward the room with an expression of boyish
apprehension</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">What's he shouting about? &hellip; has
he heard about Ada and me? &hellip; he'll raise the roof! &hellip;
but Mother'll take my side against him &hellip; she's always sided
with me &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>then resentfully</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">What do I care about him anyway?
&hellip; he hates Fife because he's scared of him &hellip; he's
scared to take up Fife's challenge to debate about whether there's
a God or not &hellip; when Fife took out his watch and said if
there was a God let Him prove it by striking him dead in five
minutes, why was it nothing happened? &hellip; I should think if
&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>He looks around uneasily, afraid of where his thoughts are
leading him. A faint flash of lightning from the distant storm
flickers through his window. He starts guiltily and hastily makes a
reassuring declaration of faith.</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Of course there's a God &hellip; He
wouldn't pay any attention to a fool like Fife, that's all
&hellip;</p>

<p>LIGHT--I believe that storm must be coming this way. (<i>He gets
to his feet--a bit shamefacedly</i>) I think I'll close the
shutters.</p>

<p>MRS. LIGHT--But it'll make it so dreadfully close in here!
(<i>Then seeing his ashamed look, she smiles.</i>) Oh, all right,
close them if you're getting scared.</p>

<p>LIGHT--(<i>his dignity ruffled, turns his back on her and goes
to the window</i>) Lightning gets on lots of people's nerves
without their being afraid of it.</p>

<p>REUBEN--</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Aw, what's the matter with me? &hellip;
that lightning had nothing to do with what I was thinking
&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>He goes to the window and looks over toward the Fife
home.</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Ada said she'd put a record on the
Victrola as soon as she was free &hellip; then I was to meet her
down by the lilacs &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>He breathes in the spring.</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Gee, those lilacs smell sweet &hellip;
I wish she'd hurry up &hellip; I've got to get up my nerve and tell
her I love her &hellip;</p>

<p>LIGHT--(<i>stands by the window and sniffs the air</i>) Can you
smell the perfume of the lilacs, Amelia? Do you remember our first
spring here?</p>

<p>MRS. LIGHT--Of course. (<i>then, after a pause, her voice turned
bitter</i>) Twenty-three years! It's a long time to live in this
awful little house! Hutchins, are you ever going to insist that
they install electric lighting here? It's a shame the way they deny
you the ordinary comforts of life!</p>

<p>LIGHT--(<i>turns away and leans out of the window staring into
the night</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Comforts of life &hellip; she has
always desired the comfortable path &hellip; where the spirit
decays in the sinful sloth of the flesh &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>From the open, curtained windows of the Fife living room a
burst of laughter is heard--Fife's voice, sardonic and malicious.
Light draws back into the room, muttering viciously</i>) Scum of
the earth! (<i>then turning on his wife</i>) Tell me, has Reuben
been having anything to do with that cursed pack next door? That
scoundrel called something at me on the street today--</p>

<p>MRS. LIGHT--(<i>impatiently</i>) Don't you know that man well
enough by this time not to pay attention to his trying to rile
you?</p>

<p>LIGHT--Then answer me this: why has Reuben taken such a sudden
notion to going out in the evening lately?</p>

<p>MRS. LIGHT--Do you expect a boy of his age to stay in like a
poor stick-in-the-mud just because he happens to be a minister's
son--especially when it's spring?</p>

<p>LIGHT--I remembered that it's spring--and I've just remembered
that Fife has a daughter!</p>

<p>MRS. LIGHT--That painted flapper with her skirts hitched up over
her knees! Do you think for one moment that Reuben, who never looks
at girls anyway--and knowing what her father is--Really, Hutchins,
you're getting just too stupid! (<i>From the Fife house comes the
sound of a Victrola starting a jazz record.</i>)</p>

<p>REUBEN--(<i>starts from his dream by the window
upstairs</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">That's her signal! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>He hurriedly puts on his coat.</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">I better sneak out the back
&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>He blows out the light and makes his way carefully out the
bedroom door in right, rear.</i>)</p>

<p>LIGHT--(<i>listening to the Victrola, fixes his eyes on his wife
combatively</i>) You may call me as stupid as you like but I insist
there was something back of what Fife said about Reuben. He sneered
that we'd better keep him home at night and insinuated he was
hanging around their place. The thought of that girl of his never
entered my head until a moment ago--but what else could he mean?
I'm going to face Reuben with it right now and we'll see what he
has to say for himself.</p>

<p>MRS. LIGHT--(<i>sharply</i>) Now don't you go preaching at him
again. You better let me talk to him first. He's never lied to me.
(<i>She goes toward the door in rear, plainly worried now but
trying to make little of it.</i>) You're always so ready to believe
the worst of him. I know it's all nonsense. (<i>She goes
out.</i>)</p>

<p>LIGHT--(<i>sits thinking gloomily</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Never lied to her &hellip; she means he
does to me &hellip; why? &hellip; have I been too stern? &hellip;
but even when he was little I sensed in him his mother's rebellious
spirit &hellip; and now &hellip; if it is Fife's daughter &hellip;
what a feather in that blasphemer's cap to corrupt my son! &hellip;
how the gossips would sneer at me! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>This thought drives him frantic--he paces up and down trying
vainly to calm himself.</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">No, no! &hellip; Reuben could never be
guilty of so base a treachery! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>He sits down by the table and, picking up his Bible, begins
to read in a determined effort to get his mind off the
subject.</i>)</p>

<p>MRS. LIGHT--(<i>can be dimly made out entering the bedroom above
just as Reuben, coming from the back door of the house, slinks
stealthily around the rear corner across the patch of moonlit lawn
to the shadow of the lilacs. Keeping in this shadow he moves down
until he comes to a small gap that is almost at the end of the
hedge, front. He stands by this, waiting nervously, peering through
the gap at the Fife house. Mrs. Light thinks worriedly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Gone to bed? &hellip; so early?
&hellip; was he sick and didn't tell me? &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>She has come to the bed--with sudden fear</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">He's not here! &hellip; he sneaked out!
&hellip; the first time he ever did such a thing! &hellip; but how
do I know it's the first? &hellip; all the evenings I thought he
was here studying &hellip; it can only mean one thing! &hellip; a
girl! &hellip; not a good girl! &hellip; it must be that Fife girl!
&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>She goes to the window, peering out but keeping her head
carefully inside--with fierce jealousy</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">That dirty little &hellip; I'd like to
see her try to catch my Reuben! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>There is a strong flash of distant lightning that suddenly
reveals Reuben in his hiding place by the hedge. She gives a
gasp.</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Oh! &hellip; there he is! &hellip;
watching their house! &hellip; I'll just watch him and make sure.
&hellip; Oh, Reuben, I can't believe it, you've never noticed
girls! &hellip;</p>

<p><i>There is darkness for a moment--</i>(<i>as if the moon had
passed behind a cloud</i>)<i>--to mark the end of Scene One. No
time elapses between Scenes One and Two.</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name="s102" id="s102">SCENE TWO</a>--<i>When it grows light
again the outer walls of the two rooms in the Light home have been
replaced, while the interiors of the Fife sitting room and the
couple's bedroom above it are now revealed. There is one small
window on the top floor front of the Light home, two on the ground
floor. Mrs. Light's head can be seen peering out of the side
bedroom window at Reuben, crouched in the shadow of the lilacs. The
two rooms in the Fife home, bright with all their electric lights
on, are of a glaring newness. There is a table at center, front, in
the sitting room, a Victrola in the rear corner, left, near the
door in the left wall which leads to the hall. In the right wall
are three windows looking out on the lawn toward the lilac hedge
and the Light home. These windows are repeated in the same series
in the bedroom above. The bed is at left, front, its head against
the left wall. In the same wall, to the rear of the bed, is the
door. There is a dressing table with a big mirror against the rear
wall, right, near the windows.</i></p>

<p><i>Ramsay Fife is seated at the left of the table, glancing
through the pages of a technical book on Hydro-Electric
Engineering. His wife is lying back in a chaise longue that she has
pushed close to the windows on the right so she can stare out up at
the sky.</i>
</p>

<p><i>Fife is a small wiry man of fifty, of Scotch-Irish origin,
with a sharp face and keen black eyes. His thin mouth is full of
the malicious humor of the practical joker. He has a biting tongue,
but at bottom is a good-natured man except where the religious
bigotry of his atheism is concerned. His wife is tall and stout,
weighing</i> <i>well over two hundred. Her face must have once been
one of those rosy-cheeked pretty doll-like faces and in spite of
its fat, it has kept its girlish na&iuml;vet&eacute; and fresh
complexion. Her figure is not formless nor flabby. It suggests,
rather, an inert strength. A mass of heavy copper-colored hair is
piled without apparent design around her face. Her mouth is small
with full lips. Her eyes are round and dark blue. Their expression
is blank and dreamy. Her voice is sentimental and wondering. She is
about forty years old.</i></p>

<p><i>Their daughter, Ada, sixteen, who is upstairs in the bedroom
putting on a heavy make-up of rouge and mascara, resembles her
father more than her mother. She has his alert quality. Her pretty
face, with her mother's big blue eyes, is alive and keen, her mouth
has a touch of her father's malicious humor. Her brown hair is
boyishly bobbed. Her speech is self-assertive and consciously
slangy. Beneath her flip talk, however, one senses a strong trace
of her mother's sentimentality.</i>
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>MRS. FIFE--(<i>dreaming sentimentally</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">I hear Ada upstairs &hellip; she's
primping up before my mirror &hellip; she's falling in love
&hellip; it's nice to be in love in May &hellip; I love May better
than any other month &hellip; May is when I first met Ramsay
&hellip; it's warm to-night &hellip; I mustn't forget to make
Ramsay change to his summer underwear this week &hellip; he always
wears his heavies too long and gets prickly heat and then he's
terrible cross &hellip;</p>

<p>FIFE--(<i>reading--disgustedly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">"Hydro-Electric engineering" &hellip;
it's studying this stuff gives those stuck-up engineers their
diplomas &hellip; "Frequency and number of phases" &hellip;
"Inherent Regulations" &hellip; "Parallel Working" &hellip; "Wave
Form" &hellip; diagrams and equations! &hellip; "The kinetic energy
of a rotor of diameter D and axial length L, running at a speed of
rotation n, is theoretically proportional to D4 Ln2" &hellip; arrh!
&hellip; the devil take their theories! &hellip; when anything goes
wrong at the plant it's me who fixes it without any theory!
&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>He tosses the book on the table and speaks to his wife.</i>)
I wish Townsend wouldn't go forcing his books on me, telling me I
owe it to myself to pass for engineer's papers. (<i>with a
chuckle</i>) Him arguing with me and at the same time admitting
"Fife, you know a damn sight more about this game than I do."</p>

<p>MRS. FIFE--(<i>mooning at him with adoring eyes</i>) You know
more than any one, Ramsay.</p>

<p>FIFE--(<i>pleased but amused--teasing her as he would a big
child</i>) Oho, I do, do I? How the hell do you know? (<i>then
complacently</i>) Well, I do know more than most. There isn't a
damn job in the game I haven't had a hand at sometime or another.
(<i>He looks at her and sees she is not listening any
more.</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Look at her &hellip; in a dope dream
again &hellip; I might as well be married to a cow &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>then amusedly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Well, she's a damn funny woman &hellip;
I've never seen her equal anywhere &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>He sees the newspaper on the table and reaches for it,
glances at the headlines and settles down to reading with a grunt
of awakened interest.</i>)</p>

<p>MRS. FIFE--(<i>has again fallen to dreaming sentimentally of the
past</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">When I first met Ramsay he was a
linesman &hellip; I loved him at first sight &hellip; he was so
romantic looking with those steel climbing things on his legs
&hellip; and he wore a colored handkerchief round his neck just
like a cowboy &hellip; Pa and Ma warned me linesmen were no good
&hellip; they just ruined you and went their way &hellip; they were
wrong about Ramsay &hellip; except he did ruin me &hellip; I said,
why is it wrong when I love him? &hellip; Pa yelled to get out, I'd
disgraced the family &hellip; I never expected Ramsay'd marry me
&hellip; he was the roving kind &hellip; but as soon as he knew
he'd got me into trouble he spoke right up &hellip; "Oh, hell, then
I guess I've got to marry you" &hellip; and I said yes, and I was
awful happy &hellip; and five months after Ada was born and he was
crazy about her from the first &hellip; and we've all been happy
ever since &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>She sighs contentedly.</i>)</p>

<p>ADA--(<i>in the bedroom above, finishes making up and inspects
herself critically in the mirror--approvingly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">I got to hand it to you, baby, you're
there! &hellip; Gosh, how long is it since I put on that record?
&hellip; Rube'll be waiting &hellip; he's as bashful as a kid
&hellip; but that's what I like about him &hellip; I'm sick of
these fresh guys that think all they have to do is wink and you
fall! &hellip; Rube has got honest-to-God feelings &hellip; but of
course, I'd never love him &hellip; he's too big a Mama's boy for
me &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>She goes to the door and puts her hand on the
switch.</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Well, let's go &hellip; I'm dying to
see if he'll have nerve enough to kiss me &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>She turns out the light.</i>)</p>

<p>REUBEN--(<i>crouched by the hedge, gives a start as a flash of
lightning flickers over the sky</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Gosh, I wish Ada'd hurry up &hellip;
this isn't much fun &hellip; I'm losing all my nerve waiting
&hellip;</p>

<p>MRS. LIGHT--(<i>bending out of the window in Reuben's
bedroom--in suspense between suspicion and hope</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">She doesn't seem to be coming &hellip;
maybe it's only some game he's playing &hellip; waiting to scare
some friend of his &hellip;</p>

<p>FIFE--(<i>looking up from his paper with a snort of disgust just
as Ada enters the room</i>) The bloody swinepot!</p>

<p>ADA--(<i>comes and puts an arm around his
shoulder--teasingly</i>) What's the bad news, Pop? Has another
Fundamentalist been denying Darwin?</p>

<p>FIFE--(<i>boiling over with indignation, thrusting the paper on
her, his finger pointing out the article</i>) Read this and you
won't joke about it! (<i>As Ada begins to read, he speaks to his
wife.</i>) Of all the yellow tricks!</p>

<p>MRS. FIFE--(<i>coming out of her dream with a start</i>) What,
Ramsay?</p>

<p>FIFE--This story in the paper! There was a man in Ohio many
years back killed another fellow in a fight about a girl. He got
twenty years for it, but the girl helped him to escape and they
both got clean away to the Coast, where he settled down under
another name and they were married and had a daughter. He became
one of the town's best citizens, and damned if his daughter didn't
get engaged to the minister's son! Then, just before the wedding,
the old man feels he's honor bound to tell his future son-in-law
the secret of his past; so the damned idiot blathers the whole
story of his killing the man and breaking jail! And what do you
suppose that young skunk does? Breaks off with the girl and goes to
the police with the story, saying he's bound by his conscience to
squeal on him!</p>

<p>ADA--(<i>who has finished reading the story</i>) Phew! Some
louse, that boy!</p>

<p>FIFE--Arrh! They're all the same, the Bible-punching breed!
(<i>then with a touch of severity</i>) And mind you bear that in
mind, young lady, when you're fooling with that young ass next
door!</p>

<p>ADA--Hey, listen, Pop! Honestly, I think you've got a nerve
to--Why, it was you said to start up an acquaintance with him, when
I told you I'd caught him staring at me, because you knew how it'd
get his old man's goat!</p>

<p>FIFE--(<i>his sense of humor returning--with a malicious
grin</i>) Aye, it will that! I gave him a strong hint on the street
to-day that upset him. Oh, if you'd only make a prize jackass of
that yellow Nancy son of his!</p>

<p>ADA--Say, why have you got it in for Rube so? He's not to blame
for his father. (<i>then hastily</i>) Not that it's anything in my
young life. I'm simply having fun kidding him along. (<i>then
defensively again</i>) But Rube's a good scout--in his way. He
isn't yellow.</p>

<p>MRS. FIFE--(<i>suddenly--with a placid certainty</i>) You're
falling in love, Ada.</p>

<p>ADA--(<i>confused</i>) Aw, Mom, where d'you get that stuff?</p>

<p>FIFE--(<i>has glanced at her with suspicion</i>) So you don't
believe that lad's yellow, don't you? What'll you bet he isn't?
(<i>then as she doesn't answer</i>) I dare you to bring him in
tonight, and let me talk to him and you listen, and if I don't show
him up yellow then I'll buy you the best dress you can find in the
town! (<i>as she hesitates--tauntingly</i>) Are you afraid to take
me up?</p>

<p>ADA--(<i>with defensive flippancy, turns to go</i>) I'll think
about it. There's a dress in Steele's I've had my eye on. (<i>She
goes out the door at left.</i>)</p>

<p>FIFE--(<i>looks after her--frowning</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">She acts queer about him &hellip; it's
time I took a hand in this &hellip; I've got to fix up a scheme on
him quick &hellip; she'll bring him back if she has to drag him
&hellip;</p>

<p>ADA--(<i>has come out of the house by the front door, off left,
and enters from the left, then hesitates for a moment, debating
with herself</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Shall I make him come in? &hellip;
he'll be scared stiff! &hellip; but Pop was only bluffing &hellip;
well, I'll just call his bluff! &hellip; he can't get away with
that stuff with me! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>She walks toward the gap in the hedge.</i>)</p>

<p>MRS. LIGHT--(<i>can see her now from the window</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">There she comes &hellip; the little
harlot! &hellip;</p>

<p>ADA--(<i>calling</i>) Rube.</p>

<p>REUBEN--(<i>comes through the hedge to
her</i><b>--</b><i>sheepishly</i>) Hello, Ada. (<i>Then, as he
stands beside her, looking down into her face, a sudden thrill of
desire almost overcomes his timidity.</i>) Gosh, Ada,--you're
pretty in the moonlight. I--I wish--(<i>His courage fails
him--lamely</i>) It's certainly grand to-night, isn't it?</p>

<p>ADA--Yeah. It's great. (<i>She takes one of his hands.</i>) Come
on in my house and meet Pop. I want you to see he isn't the devil
out of hell your old man makes him out to be.</p>

<p>REUBEN--(<i>immediately terrified</i>) I can't, Ada! You know I
can't. Why don't we walk the same as--</p>

<p>ADA--I'm sick of walking. (<i>as he still holds
back--tauntingly</i>) Are you scared Pop will eat you? You make me
sick, Rube!</p>

<p>REUBEN--It's not because I'm scared of your father; it's
because--</p>

<p>ADA--Afraid your Mama would spank you if she found out? (<i>then
as he still hesitates</i>) Oh, very well, you know what you can do,
don't you? (<i>She turns her back on him and walks away.</i>)</p>

<p>REUBEN--Ada! Wait a minute! Please don't get sore! I'll
come!</p>

<p>ADA--Good boy! (<i>She suddenly raises herself on tiptoe and
kisses him--with a little laugh</i>) There! That's to help keep
your nerve up!</p>

<p>REUBEN--(<i>a wave of passion coming over him, grabs her by the
shoulders and bends his face close to hers</i>) Ada!</p>

<p>ADA--Ouch! That hurts, Rube!</p>

<p>REUBEN--I don't care if it does! I love you, Ada! (<i>He tries
to kiss her.</i>)</p>

<p>ADA--(<i>struggling away from him</i>) Hey, cut it out! What do
you think I am? (<i>Then, as, brought back to himself, he releases
her in shamefaced confusion, she adds tartly, her confidence
restored and her temper a bit ruffled</i>) Listen here, Rube, just
because I kissed you in fun, don't get too fresh!</p>

<p>REUBEN--I--I didn't mean nothing bad--honest I didn't!</p>

<p>ADA--All right, only don't get rough again. (<i>taking his
hand</i><b>--</b><i>in a bullying tone</i>) Come on. Let's go in.
(<i>Reuben follows her off left mechanically, a look of growing
dread on his face.</i>)</p>

<p>MRS. LIGHT--</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">She kissed him! &hellip; the brazen
little harlot! &hellip; where is she taking him? &hellip; I've got
to stop her! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>She draws back quickly from the window and can be made out
going hurriedly from the bedroom.</i>)</p>

<p><i>FIFE--</i>(<i>irritably</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">May the devil kill me if I can think up
a good scheme &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>He turns his exasperation on his wife.</i>) How can I think
in the same room with you? It's like trying to swim in glue! For
God's sake, get out of here!</p>

<p>MRS. FIFE--(<i>raises herself to her feet placidly, without a
trace of resentment</i>) I'll go upstairs and read the paper.</p>

<p>FIFE--(<i>starts to thrust the paper on her</i>) Here you are
then! (<i>But as he does so his eye lights on the same headline
that had attracted his attention before and suddenly he has an
inspiration and grins elatedly.</i>) By God, I've got it, May! I'll
try that on him! All the pious folks in this town think I've a bad
record behind me--(<i>He pushes the paper into her hands.</i>) Get
out of here quick! I don't want you around to give me away! (<i>She
goes out. He waits, looking at the door, a grin of malicious
expectancy on his face. At this moment Mrs. Light, who has come out
by her kitchen door, appears around the corner of her house and
slinks hurriedly across the patch of lawn to the shadow of the
lilacs at the extreme edge of the hedge, front.</i>)</p>

<p>MRS. LIGHT--(<i>peers stealthily around the corner of the
hedge</i> <i>down the street--in an extreme state of
agitation</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">I can't see them &hellip; they're
hiding somewheres &hellip; she'll be kissing him &hellip; oh, just
wait till I tell her what I think of her! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>She starts out of the shadow of the lilacs as if to go down
the street</i> <i>but the brightness of the moonlight frightens her
and she moves</i> <i>quickly back into the shadow.</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Supposing any one should see me
&hellip; oh, I don't know what to do! &hellip; that nasty wicked
boy! &hellip; he'll be punished good for this! &hellip;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>There is darkness again for a moment, to mark the end of
Scene Two. No time elapses between Scenes Two and Three.</i>
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name="s103" id="s103">SCENE THREE</a>--<i>When the light
comes on again, the wall of the Fife bedroom has been replaced.
Their sitting room is revealed as before with Fife still sitting
looking expectantly at the door. And now the interior of the Light
sitting room is again shown with Light sitting as at the end of
Scene One. He holds the open Bible but he is staring moodily over
it. Mrs. Light, as before, is hiding in the shadow of the lilac
hedge, peering down the road, ashamed of her position and afraid
she will be discovered.</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>LIGHT--(<i>thinking gloomily</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">I must be honest with myself &hellip;
who am I to cast the first stone at Reuben if he desires a woman?
&hellip; hasn't my love for Amelia been one long desire of the
senses? &hellip; I should understand Reuben's weakness and forgive
him &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>then his resentment smoldering up</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">But to betray me to Fife! &hellip; that
would go deeper! &hellip; it would be treachery to God!
&hellip;</p>

<p>MRS. FIFE--(<i>leans out of the front window of the bedroom
upstairs</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">I don't want to read the paper &hellip;
I'd rather look at the moon &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>mooning up at the moon</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Ada loves that Light boy &hellip; he
must be nice &hellip; he isn't to blame because his father believes
in religion &hellip; maybe his father is nice too if you got to
know him off the job &hellip; Ramsay is always so cranky when he's
at the plant &hellip; I love the plant &hellip; I love the dynamos
&hellip; I could sit forever and listen to them sing &hellip;
they're always singing about everything in the world &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>She hums to herself for a moment--an imitation of the
whirring purr of a dynamo.</i>)</p>

<p>MRS. LIGHT--(<i>hearing this noise, looks up around the corner
of the hedge and sees her and immediately dissolves into abject
shame and fright</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Oh, my God! &hellip; did she see me?
&hellip; she'll tell the whole town I was spying! &hellip; oh, this
is terrible! &hellip; I ought to get Hutchins &hellip; but I can't
move while she's watching &hellip;</p>

<p>FIFE--(<i>standing up and looking at the door</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Ada's a long time bringing him &hellip;
there's a lot of whispering in the hall &hellip; he's afraid, I'm
thinking &hellip; about to enter the presence of Satan &hellip;
I'll have to start in making him think I'm the devil himself!
&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>Ada comes in the doorway of the sitting room, left, followed
by Reuben.</i>)</p>

<p>FIFE--(<i>without waiting for an introduction, goes up and
shakes Reuben's hand with an exaggerated cordiality</i>) So you're
young Mr. Light, are you? I'm damned glad to make your
acquaintance. Sit down and make yourself at home. (<i>All the time
he is talking, he stares at Reuben's flustered face, keenly sizing
him up. He forces him to sit in the chair across the table from
him. Ada sits down at right, watching her father with a challenging
smile.</i>)</p>

<p>REUBEN--(<i>stammers</i>) Pleased to meet you. Thank you.
Thanks.</p>

<p>FIFE--(<i>with a sudden change to severity</i>) I want a damned
serious talk with you, young man! That's why I had Ada invite you
in! (<i>as Reuben stares at him bewilderedly</i>) But before we
start that, let me ask you, is your reverend father ever going to
take up my challenge to debate with me?</p>

<p>REUBEN--(<i>shamefacedly</i>) I--I don't think so.</p>

<p>FIFE--(<i>jeeringly</i>) He's afraid I'd beat him!</p>

<p>REUBEN--(<i>defensively</i>) No, he isn't! He can answer all
your arguments easy--with things right out of the Bible! He's only
scared that folks'd think he was wrong to argue with you! (<i>then
raising his voice defiantly</i>) But I'd argue if I was in his
place!</p>

<p>MRS. LIGHT--(<i>from her hiding place by the hedge has caught
Reuben's raised voice--with horrified stupefaction</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">That was Reuben's voice! &hellip; he's
actually in there talking to that atheist! &hellip; oh, I wish I
could get closer to the window! &hellip; but she'd see me!
&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>But she comes around the end of the hedge as far as she can
get and strains her ears.</i>)</p>

<p>FIFE--(<i>smiling mockingly at Reuben</i>) Well, maybe after
you're a minister you and me'll argue it out sometime.</p>

<p>REUBEN--(<i>glad to make a show of his independence before
Fife</i>) I'm not going to be a minister! Father wants me to but
Mother doesn't--and I don't want to be. Besides, I've never felt
the call. You have to feel God calling you to His service.</p>

<p>FIFE--(<i>with a leer</i>) And how does God call you, tell me?
I'm thinkin' He wouldn't use the telegraph or telephone or radio
for they're contraptions that belong to His archenemy Lucifer, the
God of Electricity. (<i>Reuben's face has flushed with mingled
indignation and fear. He looks up at the ceiling apprehensively,
then opens his mouth to make some retort to Fife when there is a
vivid flash of lightning. He gives a start and half rises from his
chair, controlling an impulse to run from the room. Fife's keen
eyes are watching him and he grins with satisfaction.</i>)</p>

<p>REUBEN--(<i>stammers</i>) You better not--talk like that,
or--you better look out!</p>

<p>FIFE--What's the trouble, young fellow? Are you afraid of a bit
of lightning? Don't worry about me. The devil looks after his own!
But a minister's son has reason to worry, maybe, when he's in a den
of atheism, holding intimate converse with a damned man! I'm
thinking your Jehovah might aim a thunderbolt at me but Lucifer
would deflect it on to you--and he's the better electrical expert
of the two, being more modern in his methods than your God!</p>

<p>REUBEN--(<i>in a turmoil of guilt and fright</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">I wish I'd never come here! &hellip;
God may strike him! &hellip; He certainly ought to! &hellip; if I
was God, I'd kill him for blaspheming like that! &hellip;</p>

<p>ADA--(<i>observing Reuben--worriedly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Why did the poor boob let Pop get wise
he was scared of lightning? &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>then indignantly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Pop has no right to pick on religion!
&hellip; that's hitting below the belt! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>protesting</i>) Aw, Pop, lay off religion, can't you!</p>

<p>FIFE--(<i>glances at her irritably--then with a calculating tone
to Reuben</i>) Ada's right, Mr. Light. I didn't have you in to
convert you to atheism. This is a free country and you're free to
believe any God-forsaken lie you like--even the book of Genesis!
(<i>then solemnly</i>) But here's what I did have you in for, and
I'll come right to the point. As a father I want to know what your
intentions are regarding my daughter! (<i>Reuben stares at him in
open-mouthed amazement.</i>)</p>

<p>ADA--(<i>embarrassed but cannot help a giggle of amusement when
she looks at Reuben</i>) Aw, Pop, what--</p>

<p>FIFE--Keep your tongue out of this! (<i>sternly to Reuben</i>) I
trust you mean honorably by her, young fellow, or it'll be the
worse for you! I'll have no young spark seducing my
daughter--getting her with child, maybe, and then deserting her
with no marriage lines to save her from disgrace! (<i>Ada begins to
see this as a huge joke and she has to bury her face in her hands
to choke back her laughter as she looks at Reuben's face on which
is at first a shocked look of stupefaction. But this gives way to a
fit of indignation that any one could think him so low.</i>)</p>

<p>REUBEN--What do you think I am? You have no right to say that
about me! I'm not that kind of--(<i>then his voice booming like his
father's with moral self-righteousness</i>) I respect Ada just as
much as I do my mother! I'm going to marry her!</p>

<p>ADA--(<i>genuinely flustered--trying to laugh it off</i>) Gee,
Rube, did I say you had no nerve? I take it all back! (<i>Reuben's
nerve immediately deserts him. He hangs his head in acute
embarrassment, his eyes on the floor.</i>)</p>

<p>MRS. LIGHT--(<i>by the end of the hedge</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Marry her! &hellip; I heard it clear as
day! &hellip; respect her like he does me! &hellip; damn her!
&hellip; Oh, I didn't mean to swear! &hellip; I don't know what I'm
doing! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>then weeping hysterically and trying to stifle it</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Oh, I'll get Hutchins to beat him
within an inch of his life! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>She sinks down on the ground, her hands over her
face.</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">I've got to stop! &hellip; she'll hear
me up there! &hellip; she'll tell how I was crying! &hellip;</p>

<p>MRS. FIFE--(<i>has noticed the noise of Mrs. Light's movements
and looks down vaguely</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Some animal's in the garden &hellip;
maybe it's a skunk &hellip; I'd love to have a skunk skin coat next
winter &hellip; maybe Ramsay'll give me one for Christmas &hellip;
Ramsay calls the minister a skunk &hellip; poor Mr. Light! &hellip;
Ramsay says awful mean things sometimes &hellip; but it's only
because he loves to make jokes &hellip; he's the kindest man in the
world &hellip;</p>

<p>FIFE--(<i>pretending to be sunk in thought has been staring
calculatingly at Reuben--solemnly</i>) Young man, I'll be honest
with you. In view of your honorable intentions I feel bound by my
conscience to let you know the secret of the family you're wanting
to marry into. But you must give me your word of honor, as man to
man--I don't ask you to swear on the Bible--that you'll never
repeat what I'm saying to any one, no matter how dreadful it seems
to you! Will you give me your word?</p>

<p>REUBEN--(<i>made visibly uneasy but forcing a manly tone</i>)
Sure. I wouldn't ever say anything.</p>

<p>ADA--(<i>leaning forward in her chair and watching her father
worriedly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">What's Pop going to spring? &hellip;
Rube's looking pale behind the gills, poor guy! &hellip; aw, poor
nothing! &hellip; he ought to have more guts! &hellip;</p>

<p>FIFE--(<i>with a tragic sigh</i>) There's not a living soul
knows it, barring my wife and Ada. It's like putting my life in
your hands. You know, don't you, that no one knows what I done
before I came to this town, nor where I came from. I've good reason
for keeping it dark. Listen now. Twenty years ago there was a man
by the name of Andrew Clark lived in the town of Arming, Ohio.
(<i>He pauses significantly, giving a quick</i> <i>side glance at
Ada to see if she's caught the joke--then goes on with a guilty
furtiveness--lowering his voice</i>) Now Clark was in love with a
girl whose family had got her engaged to another fellow, but she
loved Clark and used to meet him in the woods. But this fellow who
was engaged to her got suspicious and one night he sneaked up on
them lying in each other's arms--in sin, as you'd call it--and he
rushed out with a knife at them both, but Clark picked up an ax and
split his skull! (<i>He finishes up with well-feigned
savagery.</i>) And serve him right, the bloody sneak!</p>

<p>REUBEN--(<i>stares at Fife with horror</i>) You mean--Clark
murdered him?</p>

<p>FIFE--(<i>with a great pretense of guilt-stricken protest</i>)
Oh, don't say that! Not murder! He killed him in self-defense!
Wouldn't you do the same if Ada was the girl and you was Clark?</p>

<p>REUBEN--</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">What is he asking? &hellip; Ada?
&hellip; would I? &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>then his horror turning to a confused rage</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">I'd kill Ada if I caught her! &hellip;
but it was the other man who caught! &hellip; and they were
engaged, too! &hellip; she belonged to him! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>harshly and condemningly--in his father's tone</i>) That
other fellow should have killed them, that's what I think! That
girl was engaged to the other fellow! She had no right to love
Clark! That wasn't love, it was lust! She was an adulteress! It
would have been only her just punishment if that fellow had killed
her! I would have!</p>

<p>FIFE--For the love of God, don't be so hard on me--for what I
was coming to tell you was that I was Clark! (<i>As if to punctuate
this dramatic confession, there is a flash of lightning, brighter
than any that has gone before.</i>)</p>

<p>REUBEN--(<i>clutches the arms of his chair in superstitious
terror, all the passion drained out of him instantly, leaving him
weak and penitent</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Oh, God, please forgive me! &hellip; I
didn't mean it! &hellip; I wouldn't ever kill her! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>then glancing at Fife with fear</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">He's a murderer! &hellip; he said
himself he was damned! &hellip;</p>

<p>FIFE--(<i>eyeing Reuben keenly</i>) After I'd killed him I gave
myself up. The jury said it was murder in the second degree and
gave me twenty years--but I fooled 'em with the help of the girl
and escaped and we both ran off to the far west and settled down in
Niclum, California, and I married her under the name of Fife and we
had a daughter. That's Ada.</p>

<p>REUBEN--(<i>keeping his eyes averted from Ada</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Then that's her mother! &hellip; she's
the daughter of an adulteress! &hellip; and a murderer! &hellip;
how can I ever trust her? &hellip; she's gone around with lots of
fellows &hellip; how do I know she never--? &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>then torturedly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Oh, God, why did I ever come here
to-night? &hellip;</p>

<p>FIFE--(<i>with a great pretense of uneasiness</i>) You don't say
a word. Well, maybe I shouldn't have told you, because now I've
made you an accessory in the murder for you'll be shielding me
unlawfully by keeping silence. And the devil knows what sin you'll
think it in the sight of God! (<i>The clap of thunder from the
preceding flash comes with a great rumble.</i>)</p>

<p>REUBEN--</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Accessory! &hellip; the police can
arrest me! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>then summoning his manhood</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">but I won't tell them! &hellip; ever!
&hellip; I gave my word! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>then conscience-strickenly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">but God! &hellip; I'll be guilty before
God! &hellip; but He knows I gave my word! &hellip; but does that
count with Him? &hellip; when I didn't swear on the Bible?
&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>then frantically</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">But He knows I love Ada &hellip; He
wouldn't want me to tell on her father &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>He suddenly jumps up and mumbles to Fife</i>) I won't tell
the police, you needn't worry.</p>

<p>ADA--(<i>with a triumphant glance at her father</i>) Good for
you, Rube!</p>

<p>REUBEN--(<i>avoiding her eyes</i>) I've got to go home now.</p>

<p>FIFE--(<i>searching Reuben's face--insistently</i>) I'm sorry to
put such a load on your conscience, Mr. Light, but I felt it was
only right of me.</p>

<p>REUBEN--</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Why does he rub it in? &hellip; God, I
hate him! &hellip; I wish they'd hung him! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>angrily--his voice booming denouncingly like his
father's</i>) You needn't be afraid I'll tell--but you ought to go
and tell yourself! You know you're guilty in the sight of God! Do
you want to burn forever in hell?</p>

<p>FIFE--(<i>jeeringly</i>) Your hell and God mean no more to me
than old women's nonsense when they're scared of the dark!</p>

<p>REUBEN--Don't you dare talk like that! I won't stand for it--not
now! If you don't stop your blaspheming, I'll--I mean, it'd serve
you right if I--(<i>hurrying toward the door as if in flight</i>) I
got to get home. (<i>He stops at the door and turns to Ada, but
keeps his eyes averted.</i>) Good night, Ada. (<i>He goes
out.</i>)</p>

<p>ADA--</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">He was threatening Pop already he'd
tell on him! &hellip; gee, he is yellow all right! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>Tears of mortification and genuine hurt come to her
eyes--she brushes them back.</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Aw, what do I care about him?
&hellip;</p>

<p>FIFE--(<i>with a chuckle</i>) He'll be blabbin' my dreadful
secret to his old man yet, wait and see!</p>

<p>ADA--(<i>to his surprise, turns on him angrily</i>) It wasn't
fair! He never had a chance! (<i>She flings herself on the chaise
longue and begins to cry.</i>)</p>

<p>FIFE--(<i>stares at her in astonishment</i>) Are you turning
against me--for that lump! (<i>Then he comes and pats her on the
shoulder.</i>) I was only doing it for your sake, Ada. You ought to
see him in his true colors so you'd not be thinking too much about
him.</p>

<p>ADA--(<i>forces back her tears and jumps up</i>) I didn't think
anything! Leave me alone about him, can't you? (<i>With a great
pretense of indifference she gets a book from the table and sits
down again.</i>) I should worry about that poor fish! I've got to
study my algebra. (<i>Her father stares at her puzzledly. There is
a bright flash of lightning and Light, sitting as before in the
sitting room of the other house reading the Bible, jumps nervously
to his feet.</i>)</p>

<p>LIGHT--</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">I ought to conquer that silly fear in
myself &hellip; the lightning is God's will &hellip; what on earth
can Amelia be doing with Reuben all this time? &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>He listens for a moment--uneasily</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">I'll go upstairs to them &hellip; she
should be more considerate than to leave me alone when &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>He walks toward the door on right.</i>)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>There is a pause of darkness here to mark the end of Scene
Three. In this darkness the clap of thunder from the preceding
flash comes. No time elapses between Scenes Three and Four.</i>
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name="s104" id="s104">SCENE FOUR</a>--<i>When the light comes
on again--but this time very dimly, as if the moon were behind
clouds--the walls of the Fife and Light sitting rooms have been
replaced while the interior of Reuben's bedroom is now revealed.
Mrs. Fife still leans out of her bedroom window and Mrs. Light sits
crouching by the hedge.</i></p>

<p>MRS. LIGHT--(<i>suddenly jumping to her feet and peering up
through the leaves at Mrs. Fife</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Oh, God, isn't she ever going in?
&hellip; I'll scream in a minute! &hellip;</p>

<p>MRS. FIFE--</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">I love to watch lightning &hellip; the
thunder clouds are getting nearer the moon &hellip; I'd like to be
a cloud &hellip; it must be nice to float in the wind &hellip; but
it must be getting bedtime &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>She slowly backs herself into her room.</i>)</p>

<p>MRS. LIGHT--(<i>as Mrs. Fife disappears</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Now I can get Hutchins &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>She slinks back along the hedge and then quickly across the
lawn around the corner of her house just as Reuben enters from the
left by the Fife house.</i>)</p>

<p>REUBEN--(<i>stands hesitating--uneasily</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">I thought I'd walk around and think up
some lie &hellip; Mother'll guess something is wrong as soon as she
looks at me &hellip; but I'm not going to stay out in the storm
&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>He walks slowly over to where he had stood with
Ada--dully</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Here's where she kissed me &hellip; why
couldn't we have gone for a walk? &hellip; she'd have let me kiss
her &hellip; I'd have had her in my arms &hellip; like her mother
was with Clark? &hellip; no, I didn't mean that! &hellip; I didn't
mean sin! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>then with desperate bravado</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Aw, what is sin, anyway? &hellip; maybe
that's just old women's nonsense, like Fife says! &hellip; why
should I have a guilty conscience? &hellip; it's God's fault!
&hellip; why hasn't He done something to Fife? &hellip; I should
think He'd have to punish adultery and murder &hellip; if there is
any God &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>There is a great flash of lightning and he stands paralyzed
with superstitious terror.</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">It comes every time! &hellip; when I
deny! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>more and more obsessed by a feeling of guilt, of being a
condemned sinner alone in the threatening night</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Fife's damned me with him! &hellip;
there's no use praying! &hellip; it's getting black! &hellip; I'm
afraid of God! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>There is a crash of thunder. He cowers, trembling--then
cries like a frightened little boy</i>) Mother! Mother! (<i>He runs
off right, forgetting that he has sneaked out by the back, making
for the front door. At the same moment Light can be dimly made out
as he enters Reuben's bedroom, and Fife sticks his head out of his
sitting-room window and looks toward the Light home.</i>)</p>

<p>FIFE--</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">That was him I heard passing &hellip;
I'll wait here and watch the fun &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>He chuckles to himself.</i>)</p>

<p>LIGHT--(<i>pauses just inside Reuben's bedroom door in alarm at
finding the room dark and empty--calls uneasily</i>) Amelia!
Reuben! (<i>He lights a match with trembling fingers and hurries
over to the lamp and lights it. His wife's voice comes excitedly
from below and then from the stairs in the hallway.</i>)</p>

<p>MRS. LIGHT--Hutchins! Hutchins! Where are you?</p>

<p>LIGHT--(<i>hurries to the door calling</i>) Here--upstairs.</p>

<p>MRS. LIGHT--(<i>a moment later hurries in excitedly, her words
pouring out</i>) Oh, Hutchins, something awful has happened--that
Fife girl--I heard Reuben asking Fife if he could marry her!
(<i>Light, completely stunned, stares at her blankly. There is the
noise of the front door being slammed and Reuben's voice calling
desperately</i>)</p>

<p>REUBEN--Mother! Where are you?</p>

<p>MRS. LIGHT--Sshh! Let him come up here. (<i>pushing him toward
the closet in rear</i>) You hide in that closet and listen! I'll
make him acknowledge everything! He'd only lie to you!
(<i>vindictively</i>) I promise I won't stand between him and
punishment this time! (<i>She gives him a final shove inside the
door and closes it.</i>)</p>

<p>REUBEN--(<i>His voice comes from the hall as he rushes
upstairs.</i>) Mother! (<i>A second later he runs in and, too
distracted to notice her expression, throws his arms around
her.</i>) Mother! (<i>He breaks down and sobs.</i>)</p>

<p>MRS. LIGHT--(<i>alarmed by the state he is in, puts her arms
around him, her immediate reaction one of maternal tenderness. She
leads him front and sits on the side of the bed.</i>) There, there!
It's all right, Reuben! Mother's here! (<i>then indignantly</i>)
What have those awful people been doing to my boy to get him in
such a state? (<i>as he gives a start--sharply</i>) Now don't deny
you were there! Don't make matters worse by lying! What happened
between you and that man? Tell Mother!</p>

<p>REUBEN--(<i>brokenly</i>) I can't! I promised him I wouldn't. I
can't tell any one!</p>

<p>MRS. LIGHT--(<i>changing to a tone of wheedling affection</i>)
Yes you can, Reuben. You can always tell Mother everything. You
always have.</p>

<p>REUBEN--(<i>clinging to her</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">I love Mother better'n anything in the
world &hellip; she always forgives me &hellip; I wish I could tell
her &hellip; she'd know what was right &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>There is a bright flash of lightning. He shrinks closer to
her and blurts out</i>) I'm scared, Mother! I'm guilty! I'm
damned!</p>

<p>MRS. LIGHT--(<i>startled</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Guilty? &hellip; does he mean he?
&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>with sudden strong revulsion</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">And to think he's had those same arms
hugging that little filthpot this very evening! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>She pushes him away, but, holding his shoulders, stares down
into his face.</i>) Do you mean to say you refuse to tell your own
mother, just because you were forced into promising not to by that
atheist? Then all I can say is that my boy I thought I could trust
has turned into a liar and a sneak, and I don't wonder you feel
guilty in God's sight! (<i>As she finishes speaking, the roll of
the thunder from the preceding flash comes crashing and rumbling.
Reuben sinks down on his knees beside her, hiding his face in her
lap.</i>)</p>

<p>REUBEN--(<i>stammers</i>) I'll tell you, Mother--if you promise
to keep it a secret--just between me and you--and never tell
Father.</p>

<p>MRS. LIGHT--All right. I'll promise.</p>

<p>REUBEN--(<i>made uneasy by something in her
tone--insistently</i>) You'll swear it on the Bible?</p>

<p>MRS. LIGHT--Yes, I'll swear on the Bible I won't tell him.</p>

<p>REUBEN--(<i>in a passion of eagerness to get the guilty tale off
his conscience</i>) His name isn't even Fife, it's Clark! He
changed it because he'd murdered a man out in Ohio where he used to
live. He got twenty years but he escaped and ran away to
California! Fife's a murderer, that's what he really is! (<i>While
he has been telling this story, the closet door has opened and
Light stands there, listening greedily. In his hand is a belt of
Reuben's.</i>)</p>

<p>LIGHT--(<i>thinking with a fierce, revengeful joy</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Lord God of Righteous Vengeance, I
thank Thee! &hellip; at last Thou strikest! &hellip;</p>

<p>MRS. LIGHT--(<i>dumbfounded, not knowing what to make of this
strange tale--and disappointed that it is not a confession about
Ada</i>) Wherever did you get hold of this story?</p>

<p>REUBEN--He told me himself.</p>

<p>MRS. LIGHT--Do you expect me to believe Fife's such an idiot as
to confess such things to you?</p>

<p>REUBEN--He had a good reason to tell me! I asked him if I could
marry Ada and he thought he was honor bound to tell me! He knew
it'd be safe with me when I gave him my word--(<i>then thinking
with guilty shame</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">But I've told! &hellip; I've just told!
&hellip; why did I? &hellip; Oh, how Ada would hate me if she knew!
&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>pleadingly</i>) Remember you swore on the Bible you'd never
tell! Remember, Mother!</p>

<p>MRS. LIGHT--(<i>glaring into his face vindictively</i>) So you
want to marry that little harlot, do you?</p>

<p>REUBEN--(<i>shakes her hands off his shoulders--shrinking back
from her, still on his knees</i>) Don't you say that, Mother! I
love Ada, Mother! I love her with all my heart!</p>

<p>MRS. LIGHT--(<i>calls over her shoulder</i>) Do you hear that,
Hutchins?</p>

<p>LIGHT--(<i>grimly</i>) Yes, I hear. (<i>He takes a threatening
step forward.</i>)</p>

<p>REUBEN--Father! (<i>Then his eyes turn to his mother's
vindictive face and he thinks in a tortured agony of
spirit</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">He was hiding in the closet! &hellip;
she knew it! &hellip; she cheated me! &hellip; when I trusted her!
&hellip; when I loved her better than any one in the world!
&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>He cries out in a passion of reproach</i>) Oh, Mother!
Mother!</p>

<p>MRS. LIGHT--(<i>misunderstanding this as a plea</i>) No, you
needn't think I'm going to get you off this time! You punish him
good, Hutchins! The very idea--kissing that dirty little--!</p>

<p>REUBEN--Don't you say that!</p>

<p>LIGHT--(<i>walks toward him</i>) Hold your tongue! How dare you
address your mother--!</p>

<p>REUBEN--(<i>his thoughts whirling in his head</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Mother's face &hellip; she looks
terrible &hellip; she wants him to beat me &hellip; she wants to
hear me yell &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>then with a defiant determination as if some hidden strength
in him had suddenly been tapped</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">But I won't give her the satisfaction!
&hellip; no matter how it hurts! &hellip;</p>

<p>LIGHT--Let this put back the fear of God into your sinful heart,
Reuben! (<i>He brings the belt down heavily across Reuben's back.
Reuben quivers but not a sound comes from his lips. At the same
moment there is a glaring flash of lightning and Light cringes back
with a frightened exclamation.</i>)</p>

<p>MRS. LIGHT--(<i>has winced when Reuben was
hit--conscience-strickenly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">That must have hurt dreadfully!
&hellip; poor Reuben! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>then with an exasperated sense of frustration, gazing at
Reuben's set face</i>)</p>

<p>Why doesn't he cry? &hellip; if he'd cry I'd stop Hutchins
&hellip; that girl has changed him! &hellip;</p>

<p>REUBEN--(<i>expecting the next blow, thinking with a grim
elation</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Come on! &hellip; hit again! &hellip;
hit a million times! &hellip; you can't make me show her you hurt
me! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>then stealing a glance up at his father's face</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">He looks scared! &hellip; it was that
lightning! &hellip; I'll never be scared of lightning again!
&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>then resolutely</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">I'll be damned if I'm going to let him
beat me! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>He jumps to his feet and faces his father
defiantly.</i>)</p>

<p>LIGHT--(<i>guiltily</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">I can't bear him looking at me like
that &hellip; I really ought to feel grateful to him &hellip; his
folly has delivered Fife into my hands &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>He throws the belt on the bed--to his wife</i>) Reuben's
punishment can wait. I have my duty of denouncing that murderer to
the proper authorities. (<i>triumphantly</i>) Haven't I always
said, if the truth were known, that man was a criminal! (<i>turning
toward the door</i>) Keep Reuben here. He might warn Fife. I'll
lock this door after me. (<i>then hurriedly, as a crash of thunder
comes</i>) I must hurry. I want to get to the police station before
the rain. (<i>He shuts the door behind him and locks it.</i>)</p>

<p>REUBEN--(<i>staring after him with the same look of
defiance--calls jeeringly</i>) Look out for the lightning! (<i>Then
he turns to his mother with a sneer--contemptuously</i>) Picture my
being scared of that boob all my life! What did you ever see in
him, to marry him? He's yellow!</p>

<p>MRS. LIGHT--(<i>frightened by the change in him but attempting a
bullying tone</i>) How dare you talk so disrespectfully--!</p>

<p>REUBEN--But you're yellow, too. And I'm yellow. How could I help
being? It's in my blood. (<i>harshly</i>) But I'll get him out of
my blood, by God! And I'll get you out, too!</p>

<p>MRS. LIGHT--(<i>pitiably now</i>) What have I done, Reuben?</p>

<p>REUBEN--(<i>bitterly</i>) You knew he was in that closet! You
led me on to tell! I thought you loved me better'n any one, and
you'd never squeal on me to him! (<i>He starts to break down
miserably.</i>)</p>

<p>MRS. LIGHT--(<i>goes to him as if to take him in her arms</i>) I
do love you better than any one, Reuben! I didn't mean--</p>

<p>REUBEN--(<i>steps back from her--accusingly</i>) And you called
Ada a harlot--after I told you I loved her with all my heart!
(<i>then a note of pleading</i>) Do you mean you didn't mean that
part of it--about her?</p>

<p>MRS. LIGHT--(<i>immediately furious again</i>) Yes, I did mean
it about her! I meant it and a lot more!</p>

<p>REUBEN--Then I'm through with you! And as for him--! (<i>He
suddenly is reminded of something--thinking wildly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">He went! &hellip; police station!
&hellip; that'll finish me with Ada! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>There is the noise of the front door slamming.</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">He's leaving! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>He rushes to the door but finds it locked--pushes and pulls
at it, trying to force it open.</i>)</p>

<p>MRS. LIGHT--I suppose you want to run over and warn your fine
friends! Fife'll be in a cell before long, please God, and if there
was any real justice his girl'd be put in along with him for she's
no better than a street-walker!</p>

<p>REUBEN--(<i>turns and glares at her</i>) I'm glad you're talking
like that! It shows you up and I can hate you now!</p>

<p>MRS. LIGHT--(<i>breaking down</i>) Reuben! For God's sake, don't
say that--to your mother!</p>

<p>REUBEN--You're not my mother any more! I'll do without a mother
rather than have your kind! (<i>He turns from her to the window and
looks out. As he does so, his father appears from right, coming
from the front door. He is buttoned up to the neck in an old
raincoat and carries an umbrella.</i>)</p>

<p>FIFE--(<i>still leaning out of his sitting room window, catches
sight of Light--calls excitedly over his shoulder</i>) Here's the
old man now! Come quick, Ada! (<i>A moment later, just as Light
comes up, she appears at the window next to her father. Her face is
set in an ugly, sneering expression. Fife calls to Light in a
mocking tone</i>) Good evening, Your Holiness.</p>

<p>LIGHT--(<i>stops short and stares at Fife with a rage that
chokes him so that for a moment his lips move, forming words, but
he can't utter them--finally finding his voice, he stammers</i>)
You--you murderer!</p>

<p>FIFE--(<i>nudging Ada--with a great pretense of guilt</i>)
Murderer? In the name of God, has your son--? after he'd sworn his
word of honor--!</p>

<p>LIGHT--(<i>triumphantly</i>) You thought you had him caught in
your snares, did you?--but God was simply using Reuben to bring
retribution on your head! (<i>in a booming triumph</i>) "Vengeance
is mine, saith the Lord!"</p>

<p>REUBEN--(<i>watching from his window</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">He's talking to Fife! &hellip; he's
telling! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>then cursing his father aloud</i>) God damn him! I'll show
him! (<i>He drives back at the door with the weight of his whole
body, and it crashes open and he stumbles over it and disappears in
the hall.</i>)</p>

<p>MRS. LIGHT--(<i>starts after him, calling frightenedly</i>)
Reuben! Don't! Reuben!</p>

<p>FIFE--(<i>enjoying himself hugely</i>) You wouldn't give me up
to the police, would you--a kind-hearted Shepherd of the Lord like
you?</p>

<p>ADA--(<i>suddenly flares up into a temper</i>) Aw, cut it out,
Pop! This has gone far enough! (<i>to Light with sneering
contempt</i>) No wonder your son is a sap! Can't you see this is
only a joke on you? Why, you poor fish, that murder story is in
to-day's <i>Star</i>--the name Clark and everything! Pop simply
copied that story--and if you go to the police you'll only be
making a boob of yourself--but go ahead if you like! (<i>As she
speaks Reuben runs in from the right. He advances threateningly on
his father who is staring at Ada stupidly, overwhelmed by the
conviction that what she has told him is true.</i>)</p>

<p>REUBEN--Did you tell--?</p>

<p>ADA--Look who's here! I was just telling your old man it was
only a murder story out of the paper Pop told you to prove you were
yellow! And you are, all right! Don't you ever dare speak to me
again! You're a yellow rat! (<i>She breaks down, weeping, and
rushes back into the room.</i>)</p>

<p>FIFE--(<i>following her</i>) Ada! Don't waste crying over--</p>

<p>REUBEN--Ada! Listen! I didn't mean--I didn't know--! (<i>He
takes a few steps toward the window, then stops, thinking
bitterly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">So it was all a lie! &hellip; a joke
she played on me! &hellip; that's why she made me meet her old man!
&hellip; so she could make a fool of me! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>He yells at the window</i>) It's you who're the rat, Ada!
You can go to hell!</p>

<p>MRS. LIGHT--(<i>hurrying in from the right. She runs to him and
tries to put her arms around him.</i>) Reuben!</p>

<p>REUBEN--(<i>pushing her away from him--furiously</i>) Leave me
alone! You're to blame for this! You cheated me! I hate you!</p>

<p>MRS. LIGHT--For God's sake, Reuben!</p>

<p>LIGHT--(<i>comes out of the state of humiliated stupefaction
into which the knowledge of the joke has thrown him--bursting into
a fatuous rage--to his wife</i>) As if I have not had enough to
bear of humiliation! (<i>He points a shaking finger at Reuben.</i>)
This dunce--this stupid dolt--now I shall be the butt of all their
sneers! And to think I stayed my hand--! But wait! I'll show him
what a real whipping is!</p>

<p>REUBEN--(<i>fiercely</i>) You'll never dare touch me again, you
old fool! I'm not scared of you or your God any more! (<i>There is
a blinding flash of lightning. Light, his nerves already at the
breaking point, gives a gasp of superstitious fright.</i>)</p>

<p>LIGHT--God have mercy!</p>

<p>REUBEN--(<i>with a sneer</i>) What God? Fife's God? Electricity?
Are you praying to It for mercy? It can't hear you! It doesn't give
a damn about you! (<i>There is a tremendous crash of thunder.
Reuben looks up and gives a wild laugh as though the thunder elated
him. His mother and father shrink back from him as he shouts up at
the sky</i>) Shoot away, Old Bozo! I'm not scared of You!</p>

<p>MRS. LIGHT--Reuben! You don't know what you're saying!</p>

<p>REUBEN--(<i>with a hard, mocking laugh--to his mother</i>)
What's the matter? Do you still believe in his fool God? I'll show
you! (<i>He jumps to his father's side and grabs his raincoat by
the lapel--addressing the sky with insulting insolence</i>) If
there is his God let Him strike me dead this second! I dare Him!
(<i>His father squeals with terror and tries to break away from his
hold. His mother screams. He laughs triumphantly.</i>) There!
Didn't I tell you! (<i>Light finally tears his coat from Reuben's
grip and runs panic-stricken off right, dragging his moaning wife
by the arm. Reuben turns his back on his home determinedly and
starts walking off left--with bitter defiance</i>) There is no God!
No God but Electricity! I'll never be scared again! I'm through
with the lot of you! (<i>As he disappears off left, the sound of
wind and rain sweeping down on the town from the hills is
heard.</i>)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>SCENE ONE--<i>The same as Act One, Scene One. The interior of
the Light sitting room is revealed.</i></p>

<p><i>It is an early morning of a hot day in August. Fifteen months
have elapsed.</i>
</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Fife is leaning out of one of the windows of their
sitting room, basking contentedly in the sun. She wears a faded
blue wrapper.</i>
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>MRS. FIFE--(<i>thinking with a sleepy content</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">The sun is hot &hellip; I feel so dozy
&hellip; I know why dogs love to lie in the sun &hellip; and cats
and chickens &hellip; they forget to think they're living &hellip;
they're just alive &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>She looks toward the Light house--with drowsy
melancholy</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Alive &hellip; poor Mrs. Light is dead
&hellip; what is death like, I wonder? &hellip; I suppose I'll have
to die sometime &hellip; I don't want to die before Ramsay &hellip;
he wouldn't know how to take care of himself &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>At a noise in the room behind her she half turns her
head--then Ada leans out of the window next to her mother. Her face
has a peaked look. Her manner is touchy and irritable and she has
lost her former air of flippancy. There is no rouge on her face and
she is dressed as if she had grown indifferent about her personal
appearance.</i>)</p>

<p>ADA--For heaven's sake, what're you dope-dreaming about now,
Mom?</p>

<p>MRS. FIFE--I was thinking of poor Mrs. Light--</p>

<p>ADA--Poor nothing! She hated us worse than poison! She'd have
sung hymns of joy if any of us had died! And why feel sorry for
her, anyway? She's lucky, if you ask me! Life is the bunk!</p>

<p>MRS. FIFE--(<i>looks at her worriedly--with a sigh</i>) I wish
that Light boy would come back.</p>

<p>ADA--(<i>immediately flying into a temper</i>) For God's sake,
shut up! I've told you a million times how dumb that talk is and
yet you keep on harping--!</p>

<p>MRS. FIFE--All right, Ada. I won't say anything.</p>

<p>ADA--What do I care about that poor fish! He can be dead for all
I care! (<i>then, as Fife's voice is heard calling from somewhere
in the house</i>) There's Pop howling his head off about something.
You go in and smooth him down, Mom. I'm sick of his grouches.</p>

<p>MRS. FIFE--(<i>as she turns to go</i>) I wish you'd make it up
with your Pop, Ada. He feels so bad about it. You've kept a grudge
against him ever since the night that Light boy--</p>

<p>ADA--There you go again! For Pete's sake, leave me alone!
(<i>Mrs. Fife disappears meekly without another word. Ada stares
before her, thinking resentfully</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">I've got a good right to have a grudge
against him &hellip; what he did that night wasn't on the level
&hellip; it isn't a question of Rube &hellip; I don't give a darn
about him &hellip; then why are you all the time thinking about
him? &hellip; I'm not! &hellip; I liked him but that was all
&hellip; and he was yellow, wasn't he? &hellip; well, maybe you'd
be worse if everything was framed against you the way Pop got him!
&hellip; poor Rube! &hellip; what's he been doing all this time, I
wonder? &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>with a sad smile of scorn for herself</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">You poor boob! &hellip; it must be
love! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>In the sitting room of the Light home, Hutchins Light enters
from the rear, right. The grief over his wife's death has made him
an old man. His hair has turned almost white, his mouth droops
forlornly, his eyes are dull, his whole face is a mask of stricken
loneliness. He comes and sits in his old chair and mechanically
picks up his Bible from the table but lets it drop again and stares
before him.</i>)</p>

<p>LIGHT--(<i>thinking dully</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Another day &hellip; empty &hellip; all
days are empty now &hellip; how long, O Lord? &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>He sighs heavily.</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">No sleep again last night except for a
few minutes &hellip; and then nightmare &hellip; I dreamed Amelia
was in my arms &hellip; and Reuben came and beckoned her and she
went away with him &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>He shudders, flinging off the memory--then wondering
bitterly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Does that dream mean Reuben is dead,
too? &hellip; what does it matter? &hellip; ever since that night
he has been dead for me &hellip; but he never gave Amelia a chance
to forget him &hellip; a postal card every month or so &hellip;
each with the same blasphemy &hellip; "We have electrocuted your
God. Don't be a fool!" her last words! &hellip; "Don't be a fool,"
she kept saying to me &hellip; she couldn't have known what she was
saying &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>He breaks down, sobbing, and buries his head in his arms on
the table.</i>)</p>

<p>MRS. FIFE--(<i>reappears in the window beside Ada. She is
smiling with a doting good nature.</i>) Your Pop told me to get out
of the room and stop looking at him or he'd start breaking plates.
My, but he's in a breakfast temper, though! The men at the plant'll
catch it--but they don't mind him. They know, like I do, that he's
really the kindest man in the world.</p>

<p>ADA--(<i>resentfully</i>) Oh, is he? I suppose that's why he
acted the way he did to Rube!</p>

<p>MRS. FIFE--He couldn't help being mean then. He'd be mean at
first to any man he thought you cared for--especially a minister's
son. But he'd get over it, you'd see. He'd like to see you happy,
before everything. I'm sure he's been wishing for a long time that
Light boy'd come home so he could make friends with him.</p>

<p>ADA--Aw, you're crazy, Mom. (<i>Suddenly she leans over and
kisses her mother affectionately.</i>) It's you who are the kindest
in the world. (<i>then embarrassed--irritably</i>) Gosh, this sun's
hot! I don't see how you stand it. (<i>She retreats into the
house.</i>)</p>

<p>MRS. FIFE--(<i>blinking placidly in the sun</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">It was awful nice the way Ada kissed me
&hellip; I wish she'd get to kissing her Pop again that way
&hellip; she does it now as if she wished she was a mosquito with a
stinger &hellip; the screen up in her room has a hole rusted in it
&hellip; I must remember to get it fixed or they'll be flying in
keeping her awake &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>A pause--then Reuben Light comes slowly in from the left
and</i> s<i>tands there, his eyes fixed for a while on his home,
taking in every</i> <i>detail. He does not for a moment notice Mrs.
Fife nor she him. A</i> <i>great change has come over him; he is
hardly recognizable as the Reuben of Act One. Nearly nineteen now,
his body has filled out,</i> <i>his skin is tanned and
weather-beaten. In contrast to his diffident,</i> <i>timid attitude
of before, his manner is now consciously hard-boiled. The look on
his face emphasizes the change in him. It is much older than his
years, and it is apparent that he has not grown its defensive
callousness without a desperate struggle to kill the shrinking boy
in him. But it is in his eyes that the greatest change has come.
Their soft gray-blue has become chilled and frozen, and yet they
burn in their depths with a queer devouring intensity. He is
dressed roughly in battered shoes, dungaree trousers faded by many
washings, a blue flannel shirt open at the neck, with a dirty
colored handkerchief knotted about his throat, and wears the coat
of his old suit. Under his arm he carries six books, bound together
with a strap.</i>)</p>

<p>REUBEN--(<i>thinking jeeringly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Home, Sweet Home! &hellip; the prodigal
returns! &hellip; what for? &hellip; I felt a sudden hunch I had to
come &hellip; to have a talk with Mother, anyway &hellip; well,
I'll soon know what it's all about &hellip; and won't the old man
be glad to see me! &hellip; yes! &hellip; he'll poison the fatted
calf! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>He laughs aloud. Mrs. Fife turns and gives a startled
exclamation as she recognizes him. He turns and looks at her for a
moment--then with a swaggering impudence</i>) Fine day, isn't
it?</p>

<p>MRS. FIFE--(<i>her eyes mooning at him, with a simple, pleased
smile</i>) I'm glad you've come home. Ada'll be glad. (<i>She stirs
as if to go into the house.</i>) I'll tell her you're here.</p>

<p>REUBEN--(<i>frowning</i>) No. I've got no time for her now.
(<i>then with a peculiar air of indifferent curiosity</i>) Are you
sure Ada'll be glad I'm back? I shouldn't think she would after
what happened.</p>

<p>MRS. FIFE--That wasn't her doing. She's been sorry about it ever
since.</p>

<p>REUBEN--(<i>with the same detached interest</i>) She called me a
yellow rat--and she had the right dope. I sure was dumb when it
came to guessing what she really wanted or I would have--(<i>with a
cold smile</i>) Well, never mind what--but you can tell her I've
changed. I've lived a lot and read a lot to find out for myself
what's really what--and I've found out all right! You can tell her
I've read up on love in biology, and I know what it is now, and
I've proved it with more than one female.</p>

<p>MRS. FIFE--(<i>preoccupied with her own thoughts</i>) It was
just one of Ramsay's jokes.</p>

<p>REUBEN--He's a great little joker! And I certainly fell for it.
Well, there's no hard feelings. He did me a favor. He woke me up.
(<i>with a laugh, a queer expression coming into his eyes</i>) You
can tell him I've joined his church. The only God I believe in now
is electricity.</p>

<p>MRS. FIFE--(<i>simply</i>) Ramsay'll be glad.</p>

<p>REUBEN--(<i>indicating the books he carries</i>) I'm studying a
lot of science. Sometimes I've gone without eating to buy
books--and often I've read all night--books on astronomy and
biology and physics and chemistry and evolution. It all comes down
to electricity in the end. What the fool preachers call God is in
electricity somewhere. (<i>He breaks off--then strangely</i>) Did
you ever watch dynamos? What I mean is in them--somehow.</p>

<p>MRS. FIFE--(<i>dreamily</i>) I love dynamos. I love to hear them
sing. They're singing all the time about everything in the world!
(<i>She hums her imitation of a dynamo's whirring purr.</i>)</p>

<p>REUBEN--(<i>startled--looks at her with growing
interest</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">"Singing all the time about everything
in the world" &hellip; she gets them all right &hellip; listen to
her &hellip; she's caught the sound &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>Abruptly he puts down his books and walks up to Mrs.
Fife.</i>) Say, you're all right! (<i>He takes one of her hands in
his clumsily--then lets go of it, grinning awkwardly.</i>)</p>

<p>MRS. FIFE--(<i>sentimentally touched--beaming on him</i>) I
always knew you must be a nice boy. (<i>with a coquettish,
incongruously girlish air</i>) But you save your holding hands for
Ada! (<i>Then she half turns around at some sound in the room
behind her--in a hurried whisper to Reuben</i>) She's coming! You
hide behind those bushes and we'll surprise her! (<i>Mechanically,
reacting instinctively for a moment as the timid boy of formerly,
he runs to the gap in the lilac bushes and hides in the old place.
Ada appears in the window beside her mother. Her face wears an
expression of eager expectation. Her eyes glance quickly on all
sides as if searching for some one.</i>)</p>

<p>ADA--(<i>flusteredly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">I'm sure I heard some one &hellip; it
sounded like &hellip;</p>

<p>REUBEN--(<i>almost as soon as he reaches his old hiding place is
overcome by shame</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">What'd I do that for? &hellip; hide!
&hellip; the old stuff! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>savagely</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">No, by God! &hellip; her mother put it
in my head &hellip; but I'll soon show Ada! &hellip; she'll find
out if I'm yellow now! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>With a swagger and a cold smile on his lip he walks through
the gap just as Mrs. Fife speaks to Ada.</i>)</p>

<p>MRS. FIFE--(<i>with a teasing smile</i>) Ada, I've got a big
surprise for you. Guess--(<i>But Ada has already seen him.</i>)</p>

<p>ADA--(<i>with a cry of joy</i>) Rube!</p>

<p>REUBEN--(<i>walks toward her, the smile frozen on his lips, his
eyes fixed on hers</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Go right up and kiss her! &hellip; look
at the way she's looking at you! &hellip; she's easy now!
&hellip;</p>

<p>ADA--(<i>staring at him, stammers his name again in a tone in
which there is now a note of panic</i>) Rube!</p>

<p>REUBEN--(<i>pulls her head down and kisses her, keeping his lips
on hers while she struggles instinctively for a moment, until she
gives up and returns his kiss--then he pushes her a little away
from him and laughs quietly, his confidence in himself completely
restored.</i>) Well, this prodigal gets the fatted kiss even if
"there ain't no calf." Hello, Ada! How's every little thing?</p>

<p>MRS. FIFE--(<i>sentimentally</i>) That's right. You two kiss and
make up. I'll leave you alone. (<i>She goes back into the
room.</i>)</p>

<p>ADA--(<i>is staring at him with eyes that search his face
apprehensively</i>) Rube! You--you've changed. I--I hardly know
you! I shouldn't have kissed you--like that. I don't know why
I--</p>

<p>REUBEN--Well, I know. (<i>He takes her face between his hands
again and brings his close to it.</i>) Because you love me. Isn't
that right? (<i>as she hesitates--insistently, giving her head a
little shake</i>) Isn't it?</p>

<p>ADA--(<i>helplessly</i>) I guess it is, Rube.</p>

<p>REUBEN--Guess, nothing! You loved me before I went away--even
when you were bawling me out for a yellow rat. That was what made
you so mad, wasn't it? You were ashamed of loving me when I was so
dumb and didn't get what you wanted and was so damned scared to
touch you. (<i>He laughs--a self-assured, insinuating laugh that
for her has something at once fascinating and frightening about
it.</i>) But you needn't worry any more, Ada. I've learned a lot
about love since I left--and I get you now, all right! (<i>then
with a sudden burst of threatening assertiveness</i>) You're damned
right I've changed! I'm not yellow about you or God or anything
else! Don't forget that, Ada! (<i>then as suddenly changing to a
passionate tone of desire</i>) Gosh, you're pretty! I'd forgotten
how pretty you were! You make all the girls I've been playing
around with look like mistakes! Your eyes are grand--and your
hair--and your mouth--! (<i>He kisses them hungrily as he
speaks--then controls himself and breaks away from her, forcing a
laugh.</i>) Continued in our next! Let's take a walk to-night.</p>

<p>ADA--(<i>staring at him helplessly</i>) Yes--no--I don't
think--</p>

<p>REUBEN--Sure you will. We'll walk out to the top of Long Hill.
That's where I was all during the storm that night after I left
here. I made myself stand there and watch the lightning. After that
storm was over I'd changed, believe me! I knew nothing could ever
scare me again--and a whole lot of me was dead and a new lot
started living. And that's the right place for us to love--on top
of that hill--close to the sky--driven to love by what makes the
earth go round--by what drives the stars through space! Did you
ever think that all life comes down to electricity in the end, Ada?
Did you ever watch dynamos? (<i>She stares at him, frightened and
fascinated, and shakes her head.</i>) I've watched them for hours.
Sometimes I'd go in a plant and get talking to the guys just to
hang around, and I tried everywhere to get a job in a plant but
never had any luck. But every job I've had--I never stuck to one
long, I wanted to keep moving and see everything--every job was
connected with electricity some way. I've worked for electricians,
I've gone out helping linesmen, I shoveled sand on a big
water-power job out West. (<i>then with sudden eagerness</i>) Say,
Ada, I've just had a hunch! I know now what drove me back here, all
right! You've got to get your old man to give me a job in his
plant--any job, I don't care what!</p>

<p>ADA--Sure--I'll try, Rube.</p>

<p>REUBEN--(<i>with a cold assurance</i>) You've got to, Ada.
Because I can't stay on here without a job. I'm broke and I won't
live home--even if the old gent would let me. And that reminds me,
I better go and pay my little visit. I don't want to see him but I
want to have a talk with Mother. I've got over my hard feelings
about her. She was so crazy jealous of you she didn't care what she
did. I can make allowances for her--now. So I'll be friends again
if she wants to--and then you watch me convert her over from that
old God stuff of his! (<i>He grins with resentful
anticipation.</i>)</p>

<p>ADA--(<i>has listened with blank astonishment--pityingly</i>)
Then you don't--? Why, I thought--Didn't they send for you?</p>

<p>REUBEN--(<i>unsuspectingly--with a grin</i>) Send for me to come
home and be good? I never gave them my address, kid. I didn't want
them bothering me. I never wrote, except some postcards to Mother I
sent to get her goat--and his. (<i>then picking up his books and
turning toward his home</i>) Guess I'll go round by the back. I
don't want to run into him unless I have to. So long, Ada. Tell
your old man I'd sure like that job! (<i>He walks to the hedge and
then, stealthily, across the lawn and disappears behind the
house.</i>)</p>

<p>ADA--(<i>looking after him</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">He doesn't know she's dead &hellip;
ought I to have told him? &hellip; oh, I couldn't! &hellip; poor
Rube! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>then admiringly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">How strong he's gotten! &hellip; but it
makes me afraid, too &hellip; his eyes seemed to take all the
clothes off me &hellip; and I didn't feel ashamed &hellip; I felt
glad! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>defiantly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">I love him! &hellip; I want him as much
as he wants me! &hellip; what of it? &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>then with a shudder she cannot repress</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">But his eyes are so queer &hellip; like
lumps of ice with fire inside them &hellip; and he never said he
loved me &hellip; aw, of course he does! &hellip; he was nuts about
me before he went away, wasn't he? &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>determinedly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">I've got to make Pop give him that job
or he might beat it again &hellip; he owes it to Rube to do
something for him &hellip; I'll talk to him right now &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>She disappears inside the house just as Reuben slowly opens
the door of the Light sitting room. There is an expression of
puzzled uneasiness on his face as he peers around the half-opened
door, then slinks in as if he were a burglar. Light is still
sitting, his face hidden in his arms on the table, in an attitude
of exhausted grief. Reuben does not at first see him.</i>)</p>

<p>REUBEN--</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Something's all wrong here &hellip;
where the hell is every one? &hellip; where's Mother? &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>He has stepped on tiptoe into the room and now suddenly he
sees his father and a sneering smile immediately comes to his
lips.</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">There he is, anyway &hellip; praying as
usual &hellip; the poor boob &hellip; there isn't a damn prayer
ever got him a thing &hellip; Mother used to make him pray for
electric lights in the house &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>suddenly with a pleased grin</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">That's a good hunch &hellip; I'll get
them put in the first money I save &hellip; it'll be like bringing
my gospel to the heathen &hellip; let there be electric light!
&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>He chuckles, then bends closer to look at his
father.</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">He must be asleep &hellip; that's one
on him to catch him &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>He speaks with mocking geniality.</i>) Hello! (<i>His father
gives a frightened start, as if dodging a blow, and stares at his
son's face with stupefied bewilderment.</i>) Sorry to disturb your
little snooze. (<i>His father continues to look at him, as if he
can't believe his eyes.</i>) Oh, this is me, all right. (<i>Then
the fact of his father's changed appearance strikes him for the
first time, and he blurts out in a tone that is almost kindly</i>)
Say, you look all in. What's the trouble? Been sick?</p>

<p>LIGHT--(<i>thinking gropingly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">It's Reuben &hellip; Reuben &hellip;
but he doesn't seem like Reuben &hellip;</p>

<p>REUBEN--(<i>misunderstanding his father's silence as
intentional, immediately becomes resentful</i>) What's the matter?
Don't you want to talk to me? Well, I'm not here to talk to you,
either. I was just passing this way and thought I'd drop in to say
hello to Mother. Where is she?</p>

<p>LIGHT--(<i>thinking more clearly now--an unstrung fury rising
within him</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Oh, yes, it's Reuben! &hellip; I
recognize him now! &hellip; the same as that night! &hellip; cruel
and evil! &hellip; and now he's asking for the mother he &hellip;
my poor Amelia! &hellip; he killed her! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>He lurches to his feet and leans against the back of his
chair weakly, glaring at his son.</i>) Murderer! You killed
her!</p>

<p>REUBEN--(<i>stares at him with a stunned look</i>) What the hell
do you mean? (<i>then harshly, taking a threatening step
forward</i>) Where's Mother, I'm asking you!</p>

<p>LIGHT--(<i>his strength failing him--in a faltering tone hardly
above a whisper</i>) She's dead--Reuben.</p>

<p>REUBEN--(<i>terribly shaken</i>) You're a liar! You're just
saying that to get my goat!</p>

<p>LIGHT--(<i>going on as if he hadn't heard--in a tone of
monotonous grief</i>) You can't see her--I can't--never--never see
her again! (<i>He breaks down abjectly, sinking on his chair and
sobbing, his face in his hands.</i>)</p>

<p>REUBEN--(<i>stands looking at him stupidly, convinced now of the
truth and trying to make himself realize it and accept it</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Then it's straight goods &hellip; she
is dead &hellip; gone &hellip; no use making a fuss &hellip; let
him cry &hellip; why can't his religion buck him up now? &hellip;
he ought to feel sure he's going to see her again soon &hellip; in
heaven &hellip; I'd like to see her again &hellip; tell her I'm
sorry for acting so rough to her that night &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>He gulps and his lips twitch.</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">I wish he'd stop crying &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>He goes forward and pats his father on the back
gingerly.</i>) Buck up. (<i>His father doesn't seem to hear him. He
turns and slumps into the chair at the far side of the
table.</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Why couldn't I have seen her just once
again &hellip; this is a rotten break &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>He asks mechanically</i>) How long ago did she die?</p>

<p>LIGHT--(<i>mechanically in his turn--without lifting his
head</i>) Two weeks ago yesterday.</p>

<p>REUBEN--</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Two weeks &hellip; it was about then I
first felt that hunch to come home and see her &hellip; that's damn
queer &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>He stares at his father--uneasily</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">He said I killed her &hellip; what the
hell did he mean? &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>forcing a casual tone</i>) What did she die of?</p>

<p>LIGHT--(<i>dully</i>) Pneumonia.</p>

<p>REUBEN--(<i>heaving a sigh of relief</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Sure &hellip; I knew he was only saying
that to get my goat &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>He speaks to his father in a defensive, accusing tone.</i>)
Pneumonia, eh? Well, it's a damn wonder we didn't all die of it
years ago, living in this dump! Ever since I can remember the
cellar's leaked like a sieve. You never could afford to get it
fixed right. Mother was always after you about it. And I can
remember the ceiling in my room. Every storm the water'd begin to
drip down and Mother'd put the wash basin on the floor to catch it.
It was always damp in this house. Mother was always after you to
make them put in a decent furnace instead of--</p>

<p>LIGHT--(<i>has lifted his head and is glaring at his son</i>)
Are you trying to say I killed her? It was you! She'd been pining
away for almost a year. Her heart was broken because you'd gone.
She hoped for a time you'd come back but finally she gave up
hoping--and gave up wanting to live! And your horrible blasphemous
postcards kept coming! She blamed herself for your ruin and she
wrote long letters begging your forgiveness, and asking you to come
home! But you'd never given her an address! She couldn't mail them,
she knew you'd never read them, and that broke her heart most of
all! You killed her as surely as if you'd given her poison, you
unnatural accursed son!</p>

<p>REUBEN--(<i>deeply disturbed but trying desperately to conceal
it</i>) I never gave her my address because I thought she'd only
write bawling me out. (<i>then harshly</i>) Where are those letters
she wrote? They're mine!</p>

<p>LIGHT--I destroyed them! I burnt them to the last scrap!</p>

<p>REUBEN--(<i>starts for his father threateningly, his fists
clenched</i>) You rotten son of a--(<i>He chokes it back--then
helplessly, with a wounded look</i>) Say, that was a dirty trick!
I'd like to have read--(<i>Light averts his eyes and suddenly hides
his face in his hands.</i>)</p>

<p>LIGHT--(<i>remorsefully now</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">He's right &hellip; I had no right
&hellip; no right even to read them &hellip; how I wish I'd never
read them! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>lifting his head</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">I destroyed them in a fit of anger.
When I read them I realized that Amelia had been thinking of you
all the time. And I felt betrayed! I hated her and you! I was
insane with hatred! God forgive me!</p>

<p>REUBEN--(<i>after a pause--dully</i>) Did she ever talk about
me?</p>

<p>LIGHT--(<i>immediately jealous again</i>) She never mentioned
your name! (<i>then forcing himself to say it</i>) I--I had
forbidden her to.</p>

<p>REUBEN--(<i>His face lights up with anger again but he controls
it.</i>) Sure, you had to, didn't you?--so what the hell? (<i>then
insistently</i>) But--didn't she?--at the last?--when she was
dying?--say anything?</p>

<p>LIGHT--(<i>fighting a furious battle with himself</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Have I got to tell him? &hellip; that
she'd even forgotten God? &hellip; that her last words were his
words? &hellip; even her soul lost to me? &hellip; must I tell
this? &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>savagely</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">No! &hellip; I don't owe him the truth!
&hellip; I must make him feel he is accursed! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>He springs from his chair and leaning across the table,
points his finger at Reuben denouncingly.</i>) Yes, with her last
breath she cursed you for all the ruin and suffering you had
brought on her--and on me! (<i>Then as he sees Reuben shrinking
back in his chair, a haunted look of horror on his face, the
consciousness of the evil of the lie he is telling overwhelms him
with guilty remorse. He stammers</i>) No!--that's a lie, Reuben!--a
terrible lie!--don't listen!--don't believe me! (<i>He stumbles
hastily around the table to the dazed Reuben and with a pitiful
gesture puts a trembling hand on his head--pleadingly</i>) Forgive
me, Reuben! You are my son as well as hers, remember. I haven't the
strength to resist evil. I wanted to punish you. She didn't curse
you. Her last words were the very words you had written her. "Don't
be a fool!" she kept saying to me! (<i>He shudders.</i>)</p>

<p>REUBEN--(<i>springs from his chair in extreme agitation and
grabbing his father by both shoulders, stares hungrily in his
face</i>) What? What's that? Mother said that?</p>

<p>LIGHT--(<i>seeming to shrivel up in his son's grip--trying
unconvincingly to reassure himself</i>) She was delirious. She must
have been delirious.</p>

<p>REUBEN--(<i>lets go of his father. The old man turns and
stumbles back to his chair. Reuben stares before him, thinking
excitedly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">"We have electrocuted your God. Don't
be a fool" &hellip; that's what I kept writing her &hellip; her
last words! &hellip; then I'd converted her away from his God!
&hellip; the dying see things beyond &hellip; she saw I'd found the
right path to the truth! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>His eyes shine with a new elation.</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">By God, I'll go on now all right!
&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>He laughs aloud to himself exultantly.</i>)</p>

<p>LIGHT--Don't, for the love of God!</p>

<p>REUBEN--(<i>immediately ashamed of himself</i>) I wasn't
laughing at you, honest. (<i>then suddenly</i>) Say, I think I'll
go and visit Mother's grave. There's some things I'd like to get
off my chest--even if she can't hear me. (<i>turning to the
door</i>) Well, so long.</p>

<p>LIGHT--(<i>dully</i>) Shall I have your room put in order for
you?</p>

<p>REUBEN--(<i>frowning</i>) No. It isn't my room now. That me is
dead. (<i>Then an idea comes to him--thinking</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">But maybe Mother'd want me to? &hellip;
maybe I'd get some message from her if I stayed here? &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>then casually to his father</i>) All right. I'll stay for a
couple of days. After that I'm going to get a room out near the
plant. Say, I might as well break the bad news to you. I'm getting
a job in Fife's power house. (<i>then quickly</i>) I suppose you
think I'm doing it to spite you, but I'm not.</p>

<p>LIGHT--(<i>dully</i>) You have sold your soul to Satan,
Reuben.</p>

<p>REUBEN--(<i>immediately resentful--with his cold smile</i>) Your
Satan is dead. We electrocuted him along with your God. Electricity
is God now. And we've got to learn to know God, haven't we? Well,
that's what I'm after! (<i>in a lighter tone--mockingly</i>) Did
you ever watch dynamos? Come down to the plant and I'll convert
you! (<i>He cannot restrain a parting shot.</i>) I converted
Mother, didn't I? Well, so long. (<i>He goes out and a moment later
walks past the front of the house from the right. He is off guard
and the callousness has gone from his face, which is now very like
that of the boy of Act One.</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">I wish she hadn't died &hellip; but she
forgave me &hellip;</p>

<p>ADA--(<i>sticks her head out of their sitting-room window as he
passes the lilac hedge. Her face is flushed with excitement, happy
and pretty now. She calls</i>) It's all right, Rube. Pop's got a
job for you. A floor man is leaving Saturday.</p>

<p>REUBEN--(<i>startled out of his thoughts, at first frowns, then
forces the cold smile to his lips</i>) That's great.</p>

<p>ADA--(<i>coquettishly</i>) Well, don't I get anything?</p>

<p>REUBEN--(<i>with his cold smile</i>) Sure! (<i>He goes to her
and reaches up as if to kiss her--then checks himself, thinking
remorsefully</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">What the hell am I doing? &hellip; I'm
going out to Mother's grave &hellip; she hated her &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>He steps back, frowning.</i>) Wait till later, Ada. Well, so
long. See you to-night. (<i>He turns his back on her abruptly and
walks off left. She looks after him, bewildered and hurt.</i>)</p>

<p><a name="s202" id="s202">SCENE TWO</a>--<i>The same except that
Reuben's bedroom is now revealed while the wall of the sitting room
has been replaced. It is about half past eleven on the same
night--a sultry, hazy sky with few stars visible. There is no light
in either house.</i></p>

<p><i>Reuben and Ada come in from the left. She is hanging on his
arm, pressing close to him as if she were afraid of his leaving
her, glancing up into his face with a timid look of mingled
happiness and apprehension.</i>
</p>

<p><i>Reuben's face shows that he also is struggling with
conflicting emotions. There is a fixed smile of triumph and
gratified vanity on his lips, but his eyes are restless and there
is a nervous uneasiness apparent in his whole manner.</i>
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>ADA--You're sure you don't hate me now--because I let you--maybe
I shouldn't have--but oh, Rube, I do love you so much! Say you love
me just as much--that you always will!</p>

<p>REUBEN--(<i>preoccupiedly</i>) Sure I will.</p>

<p>ADA--(<i>pleadingly</i>) Put your arms around me tight and kiss
me again. Then I won't be scared--or sorry.</p>

<p>REUBEN--(<i>mechanically puts his arms around her and kisses her
at first perfunctorily, then with reawakening passion</i>) Gee,
you're pretty, Ada! You've certainly got me going!</p>

<p>ADA--(<i>happily now</i>) Oh, Rube, when you kiss me like that
nothing in the world matters but you! Up on the hill when we--oh, I
felt I was just you, a part of you and you were part of me! I
forgot everything!</p>

<p>REUBEN--(<i>suddenly moves away from her and stares around him
nervously--in a strange voice</i>) Sure. You forget everything for
a minute. You're happy. Then something has to wake you up--and
start you thinking again.</p>

<p>ADA--What is it you're thinking about? Tell me and maybe I can
help you forget it.</p>

<p>REUBEN--(<i>shaking his head</i>) I can't forget. (<i>then
determinedly</i>) And I don't want to. I want to face things. I
won't ever be satisfied now until I've found the truth about
everything.</p>

<p>ADA--(<i>trying to force a joking tone</i>) And where do I come
in?</p>

<p>REUBEN--(<i>coldly</i>) You don't come in.</p>

<p>ADA--Rube! Don't say that--not after--You scare me!</p>

<p>REUBEN--(<i>irritatedly</i>) Cut out that talk of being scared!
What are you scared about? Scared what we did was a sin? You're the
hell of an atheist! (<i>then jeeringly</i>) And you're the one that
used to be always kidding me about being a goody boy! There's
nothing to be scared about or sorry for. What we did was just plain
sex--an act of nature--and that's all there is to it!</p>

<p>ADA--(<i>pitifully--her voice trembling</i>) Is that all--it
means to you?</p>

<p>REUBEN--That's all it means to any one! What people call love is
just sex--and there's no sin about it!</p>

<p>ADA--I wasn't saying there was, was I? I've proved to you I
don't--only--(<i>then frightenedly</i>) It's you, Rube. I can't get
used to you talking like that. You've changed so.</p>

<p>REUBEN--(<i>with a coarse grin</i>) Well, you've got no kick
coming. If I'd stayed the same poor boob I used to be you might
have died an old maid.</p>

<p>ADA--But--you wanted to marry me then, Rube.</p>

<p>REUBEN--(<i>roughly</i>) And a lot that got me, didn't it?</p>

<p>ADA--(<i>faintly</i>) Don't you want to--any more?</p>

<p>REUBEN--Don't I what? Talk sense, Ada! We're married by Nature
now. We don't need any old fool of a minister saying prayers over
us! (<i>then after a moment's pause--with a forced laugh</i>) Say,
here's one on me, Ada--speaking of praying. It was out at Mother's
grave. Before I thought, I started to do a prayer act--and then
suddenly it hit me that there was nothing to pray to. (<i>He forces
another laugh.</i>) It just goes to show you what a hold that bunk
gets on you when you've had it crammed down your throat from the
time you were born! You can't pray to electricity unless you're
foolish in the head, can you? (<i>then strangely</i>) But maybe you
could, at that--if you knew how!</p>

<p>ADA--Is that where you went this afternoon--out to her
grave?</p>

<p>REUBEN--(<i>with affected indifference</i>) Sure. What of
it?</p>

<p>ADA--(<i>pityingly</i>) Poor Rube!</p>

<p>REUBEN--(<i>frowning</i>) Poor nothing! She's dead, and that's
all there is about it. You've got to face death as well as
life.</p>

<p>ADA--I'm sorry she hated me so. I hope now she forgives us--for
loving each other.</p>

<p>REUBEN--(<i>with his cold smile</i>) You mean forgives us for
what we did to-night? You don't know her! She never would! But
what's the use of talking about it? Who gives a damn? Good night,
Ada. I'm tired. I'm going to bed. See you tomorrow. (<i>He turns
his back on her abruptly and walks off right toward the front door
of his house.</i>)</p>

<p>ADA--(<i>stands looking after him with bewildered hurt for a
moment, then turns back toward her own front door and begins to cry
softly, at the same time trying to reassure herself</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">No &hellip; I don't mean that, Mother
&hellip; I was thinking of how you acted that night &hellip; I wish
I could have seen you after you'd changed &hellip; after you'd come
back to my side &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>He goes to the window on the left and looks out.</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Here's where I was looking out, waiting
for Ada to signal on the Victrola &hellip; gosh, that seems a
million years ago! &hellip; how scared I was of even kissing her!
&hellip; and to-night she was dead easy &hellip; like rolling off a
log! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>He comes back to the bed and sits down.</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Mother said she was no better than a
street-walker &hellip; she certainly didn't put up a fight &hellip;
marry her! &hellip; what does she think I am, a boob? &hellip; she
put one over on me and now I've put one over on her! &hellip; we're
square &hellip; and whatever's going to happen, will happen, but it
won't be a wedding! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>then with coarse sensuality</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">But it's grand to have her around handy
whenever I want &hellip; the flesh, as the old man would call it!
&hellip; and she's all right other ways, too &hellip; I like her
&hellip; she got me the job &hellip; she'll be useful &hellip; and
I'll treat her decent &hellip; maybe it's love &hellip; whatever
the hell love is! &hellip; did Mother really love the old man?
&hellip; she must have or how could she stand him? &hellip; and she
made me with him &hellip; act of Nature &hellip; like me and Ada
&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>He jumps to his feet distractedly.</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">God, that seems lousy somehow! &hellip;
I don't want to think of it! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>He paces up and down--then pauses and appears to be
listening</i> <i>for something.</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">There's something queer about this dump
now &hellip; as if no one was living here &hellip; I suppose that's
because Mother's gone &hellip; I'd like to reach her somehow
&hellip; no one knows what happens after death &hellip; even
science doesn't &hellip; there may be some kind of hereafter
&hellip; I used to kneel down here and say my prayers &hellip; she
taught them to me &hellip; then she'd tuck me in, even after I'd
grown up &hellip; and kiss me good night &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>As if automatically he slips to his knees by the
bed.</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">I'm sorry, Mother &hellip; sorry you're
dead &hellip; I wish I could talk to you &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>He scrambles to his feet--angry at himself.</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">You damn fool! &hellip; what's come
over you, anyway? &hellip; what are you praying to? &hellip; when
there's nothing &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>then strangely</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Funny, that hunch I got when I was
talking to Ada &hellip; about praying to electricity, if you knew
how &hellip; it was like a message &hellip; Mother believed what I
believed when she died &hellip; maybe it came from her &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>then suspicious of himself again</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Aw, that's just superstitious junk
&hellip; but why is it? &hellip; look at how mysterious all this
electrical wave stuff is in radio and everything &hellip; that's
scientific fact &hellip; and why couldn't something like that that
no one understands yet? &hellip; between the dead and the living?
&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>He walks around nervously.</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">No use trying to go to sleep &hellip;
and I want to keep on thinking &hellip; but not in here &hellip;
I'll go for a walk &hellip; why not go down to the plant? &hellip;
take a look in at the dynamos &hellip; watching them always helps
me somehow &hellip; sure, that's the stuff! &hellip;</p>

<p><a name="s203" id="s203">SCENE THREE</a>--<i>A half hour later.
Exterior of the Light and Power Company's hydro-electric plant
about two miles from the</i> <i>town. The plant is comparatively a
small one. The building is red brick. The section on the left, the
dynamo room, is much wider than the right section but is a story
less in height. An immense window and a big sliding door are in the
lower part of the dynamo-room wall, and there is a similar window
in the upper part of the section on right. Through the window and
the open door of the dynamo room, which is brilliantly lighted by a
row of powerful bulbs in white globes set in brackets along both
walls, there is a clear view of a dynamo, huge and black, with
something of a massive female idol about it, the exciter set on the
main structure like a head with blank, oblong eyes above a gross,
rounded torso.</i></p>

<p><i>Through the upper window of the right section of the
building, in the switch galleries, by a dim light, one gets a
glimpse of the mathematically ordered web of the disconnecting
switches, double busses, and other equipment stretching up through
the roof to the outgoing feeders leading to the transmission
towers.</i>
</p>

<p><i>The air is full of sound, a soft overtone of rushing water
from the dam and the river bed below, penetrated dominatingly by
the harsh, throaty, metallic purr of the dynamo.</i>
</p>

<p><i>Reuben comes in from the right and approaches until he is
opposite the open doorway. He stands there staring at the dynamo
and listening to it.</i>
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>REUBEN--(<i>after a pause--fascinatedly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">It's so mysterious &hellip; and grand
&hellip; it makes you feel things &hellip; you don't need to think
&hellip; you almost get the secret &hellip; what electricity is
&hellip; what life is &hellip; what God is &hellip; it's all the
same thing &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>A pause--then he goes on in the same fascinated
tone.</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">It's like a great dark idol &hellip;
like the old stone statues of gods people prayed to &hellip; only
it's living and they were dead &hellip; that part on top is like a
head &hellip; with eyes that see you without seeing you &hellip;
and below it is like a body &hellip; not a man's &hellip; round
like a woman's &hellip; as if it had breasts &hellip; but not like
a girl &hellip; not like Ada &hellip; no, like a woman &hellip;
like her mother &hellip; or mine &hellip; a great, dark mother!
&hellip; that's what the dynamo is! &hellip; that's what life is!
&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>He stares at it raptly now.</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Listen to her singing &hellip; that
beats all organs in church &hellip; it's the hymn of electricity
&hellip; "always singing about everything in the world" &hellip; if
you could only get back into that &hellip; know what it means
&hellip; then you'd know the real God! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>then longingly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">There must be some way! &hellip; there
must be something in her song that'd tell you if you had ears to
hear! &hellip; some way that she'd teach you to know her

can't</i> <i>catch the right tone.</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">No, you can't get it! &hellip; it's as
far off as the sky and yet it's all around you! &hellip; in you!

<p>(<i>excitedly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">I feel like praying now! &hellip; I
feel there is something in her to pray to! &hellip; something
that'll answer me! &hellip;</p>

of</i> <i>light from the open doorway.</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Supposing any one saw me &hellip;
they'd think I was nutty &hellip; the old prayer stuff!

<p style="margin-left: 3em">But I feel it's right &hellip; I feel
Mother wants me to &hellip; it's the least I can do for her
&hellip; to say a prayer &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>He gets down on his knees and prays aloud to the
dynamo.</i>) Oh, Mother of Life, my mother is dead, she has passed
back into you, tell her to forgive me, and to help me find your
truth! (<i>He pauses on his knees for a moment, then gets slowly to
his feet. There is a look of calm and relief on his face now. He
thinks reverentially</i>)</p>

</h1>
</center>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>SCENE ONE--<i>Same as Act Two, Scene Three--Exterior of the
power house four months later. It is a little after sunset and the
equipment on the roof is outlined blackly against a darkening
crimson sky.</i></p>

<p><i>The door of the dynamo room is shut but the interior is
brilliantly lighted and the dynamo can be partly seen through the
window. There is a dim light above in the switch galleries as in
the previous scene. The overtone of rushing water from the dam
sounds louder because of the closed door which muffles the noise of
the dynamo to a minor strain.</i>
</p>

<p><i>Reuben enters from the left accompanied by Mrs. Fife. He has
grown very thin, his dungarees sag about his angular frame. His
face is gaunt and pale. His eyes are deeply sunken. He is talking
with unnatural excitement as they come in. Mrs. Fife is unchanged.
If anything, her moony dreaminess is more pronounced. She listens
to Reuben with a fascinated, far-away look, as if the sound of his
voice hypnotized her rather than the meaning of the words.</i>
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>REUBEN--(<i>insistently</i>) You understood all I explained to
you up on the dam, didn't you?--about how life first came out of
the sea?</p>

<p>MRS. FIFE--(<i>nods dreamily</i>) Yes, Reuben. It sounds like
poetry--"life out of the sea."</p>

<p>REUBEN--It is like poetry. Her song in there--Dynamo's--isn't
that the greatest poem of all--the poem of eternal life? And listen
to the water rushing over the dam! Like music! It's as if that
sound was cool water washing over my body!--washing all dirt and
sin away! Like some one singing me to sleep--my mother--when I was
a kid--calling me back to somewhere far off where I'd been once
long ago and known peace! (<i>He sighs with longing, his body
suddenly gone limp and weary.</i>)</p>

<p>MRS. FIFE--(<i>dreamily</i>) That's awful pretty, Reuben.
(<i>She puts her arm around him--sentimentally</i>) I'll be your
mother--yours and Ada's. I've always wanted a boy.</p>

<p>REUBEN--(<i>leans against her gratefully, his head almost on her
shoulder, his eyes half closed</i>) Yes. You're like
her--Dynamo--the Great Mother--big and warm--(<i>with a sudden
renewal of his unnatural excitement, breaks away from her</i>) But
I've got to finish telling you all I've come to know about her--how
all things end up in her! Did I tell you that our blood plasm is
the same right now as the sea was when life came out of it? We've
got the sea in our blood still! It's what makes our hearts live!
And it's the sea rising up in clouds, falling on the earth in rain,
made that river that drives the turbines that drive Dynamo! The sea
makes her heart beat, too!--but the sea is only hydrogen and oxygen
and minerals, and they're only atoms, and atoms are only protons
and electrons--even our blood and the sea are only electricity in
the end! And think of the stars! Driving through space, round and
round, just like the electrons in the atom! But there must be a
center around which all this moves, mustn't there? There is in
everything else! And that center must be the Great Mother of
Eternal Life, Electricity, and Dynamo is her Divine Image on earth!
Her power houses are the new churches! She wants us to realize the
secret dwells in her! She wants some one man to love her purely and
when she finds him worthy she will love him and give him the secret
of truth and he will become the new saviour who will bring
happiness and peace to men! And I'm going to be that
saviour--that's why I asked you to come--I want you to be a
witness! I know the miracle will happen to me to-night because I
had a message from my mother last night. I woke up and saw her
standing beside my bed--just as she used to when she came in to
kiss me good night--and she smiled and held out her arms to me. I
know she came from the spirit of the Great Mother into which she
passed when she died to tell me she had at last found me worthy of
her love.</p>

<p>MRS. FIFE--(<i>sentimentally</i>) Most people don't believe in
ghosts. Ramsay don't. But I do. Has she come many times,
Reuben?</p>

<p>REUBEN--(<i>strangely</i>) Not lately--not since I gave up
seeing Ada. Before that she used to come almost every night to warn
me.</p>

<p>MRS. FIFE--Warn you about what, Reuben?</p>

<p>REUBEN--That I was living in sin--that Dynamo would never find
me worthy of her secret until I'd given up the flesh and purified
myself! (<i>then proudly</i>) And I found the strength to do it. It
was hard! I was beginning to really love Ada.</p>

<p>MRS. FIFE--(<i>simply</i>) Of course, you love Ada--and you
shouldn't act so mean to her, Reuben. You haven't been around in a
month or more. She's making herself sick worrying.</p>

<p>REUBEN--(<i>intensely</i>) I'd like to see her! I'd love to! But
I can't. Don't you understand I can't--that my finding the secret
is more important than--? (<i>then thinking with sudden fear and
doubt</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">But supposing the miracle doesn't
happen to-night? &hellip; Ada keeps coming in dreams &hellip; her
body &hellip; I've beaten myself with my belt &hellip; I can't keep
on much longer &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>He sways dizzily on his feet, passing his hand over his
eyes--then straightens himself and turns to Mrs. Fife.</i>) I've
got to go in. They'll be missing me. And I've got to pray to her.
(<i>He goes to the door.</i>) You wait until your husband's gone
home. Then you come in.</p>

<p>MRS. FIFE--All right, Reuben. (<i>Reuben slides back the
dynamo-room door a few feet and enters, closing it behind him. Mrs.
Fife stares after him mooningly. A moment later the door from the
dynamo room is opened again and Fife comes out, closing it behind
him. He hasn't changed since his last appearance. He starts to walk
hesitatingly off right--then stops without looking around him and
does not notice his wife.</i>)</p>

<p>FIFE--(<i>thinking exasperatedly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">That damned Rube! &hellip; there's a
queer look in those cold eyes of his lately! &hellip; by God, I'd
fire him tonight if Ada wouldn't make my life a hell for it!
&hellip; but he does his work good &hellip; too damned good!
&hellip; he's always pawing around a dynamo when he's no business
&hellip;</p>

<p>MRS. FIFE--Hello, Ramsay. You better get home to supper. I had
mine early. I had to go out.</p>

<p>FIFE--(<i>turns on her with an irritated start</i>) Oh, you did,
did you? You're always having to go out these days, it seems! I
won't have you gallivanting down here at all hours and staring at
the dynamos and humming like a half-wit! What the hell's come over
you, anyway?</p>

<p>MRS. FIFE--Nothing's come over me, Ramsay. I was talking to
Reuben. He took me up on the dam and told me about how we all used
to live in the ocean once. (<i>then in her tone of childish
mooning</i>) D'you suppose I ever was a fish, Ramsay?</p>

<p>FIFE--Aye, a jellyfish, I'm thinking! You've the brains for
that! (<i>then angrily</i>) You do too much gabbing with that Rube!
He'll addle the little sense you've left! But if you've got to talk
to him, make him talk turkey and say when is he planning to marry
Ada! Aren't you her mother, and don't you see she's worrying her
heart out? (<i>lowering his voice</i>) D'you think it's happened
between them--you know what I mean?</p>

<p>MRS. FIFE--(<i>with na&iuml;ve simplicity</i>) Yes, of course it
has, Ramsay. She loves him the same as I did you when we--</p>

<p>FIFE--Don't be comparing him to me! I was more of a decent man
than he ever will be! (<i>in a passion</i>) I'll have a talk with
that lad and if he don't do the decent thing by her, I'll beat
decency into him! (<i>He turns from her in a tantrum.</i>) To hell
with you! I'm hungry! I'm going home! (<i>He goes off right, Mrs.
Fife looks after him with a placid smile--then she gives the big
door a push that slides it open to its full width and steps inside
and, as she sees Reuben, stops as she is about to pull the door
closed again. He is kneeling just inside the doorway before the
dynamo in the foreground, his arms stretched out to it
supplicatingly.</i>)</p>

<p>REUBEN--(<i>suddenly cries out with a note of despair</i>)
Mother! Don't you hear me? Can't you give me some sign? O Dynamo,
who gives life to things, hear my prayer! Grant me the miracle of
your love! (<i>He waits, his body strained with suspense, listening
as if he expected the dynamo to answer him. Ada comes from around
the corner of the building at the left. Her manner is furtive as if
she were doing something she is ashamed of. She looks worried and
run down, although she has made a defiant effort with rouge and
mascara to hide this.</i>)</p>

<p>ADA--</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">He must be around some place
&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>She moves cautiously to the window and peeks in, but cannot
see him.</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">I don't want no one to see me &hellip;
I'll knock on the window when I see him and get him to come out
&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>then with bitter self-contempt</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Here I am chasing after him! &hellip;
but I couldn't stand it any more, waiting &hellip; oh, what a damn
fool I was to give in so easy! &hellip; no wonder he's sick of me!
&hellip; but he can't throw me over this way! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>She looks in the window again.</i>)</p>

<p>REUBEN--(<i>his tense, supplicating attitude suddenly relaxing
dejectedly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">She won't answer me &hellip; there must
still be something I've got to do &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>then guiltily</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Maybe she feels I haven't killed all
desire for Ada yet? &hellip; that I ought to face her and conquer
the flesh once for all &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>He jumps to his feet and turns to Mrs. Fife pleadingly.</i>)
Can't you tell me? You know what she means sometimes. (<i>He lowers
his voice cautiously as if he didn't want the dynamo to
overhear.</i>) Do you think it's something I've got to do about
Ada?</p>

<p>MRS. FIFE--(<i>simply</i>) Yes, you've got to do the right thing
by Ada, Reuben.</p>

<p>REUBEN--(<i>thinking with unnatural excitement</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Then that is it! &hellip; I'll have to
go and face Ada right now! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>turning to Mrs. Fife</i>) You stay here! I'll be back.
(<i>He comes out, sliding the door closed after him.</i>)</p>

<p>ADA--(<i>turns at the noise of the door closing from where she
is looking in the window and calls to him</i>) Rube!</p>

<p>REUBEN--(<i>whirls around and stands staring at her with strange
fixity for a moment, his thoughts seizing on this
coincidence</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">It's Ada! &hellip; Dynamo sent her
here! &hellip; she wanted to prove I've conquered the flesh!
&hellip;</p>

<p>ADA--(<i>frightenedly</i>) What's the matter? Don't look at me
like that, Rube!</p>

<p>REUBEN--(<i>moved in spite of himself, instinctively takes a
step toward her--in a queer, detached tone</i>) I didn't mean to
scare you, Ada. You gave me a start, seeing you all of a
sudden.</p>

<p>ADA--(<i>looking at him hopefully</i>) You're not sore at me for
coming, are you?</p>

<p>REUBEN--No. It's as if you'd been sent. Didn't you feel
something driving you to come here right now?</p>

<p>ADA--(<i>quickly</i>) Yes, I just had to come!</p>

<p>REUBEN--(<i>strangely</i>) It was she who made you come.</p>

<p>ADA--She? Who's she?</p>

<p>REUBEN--(<i>A lightning change comes over his face. He takes a
threatening step toward her--denouncingly, his voice booming like
his father's</i>) You blasphemous fool, you! Do you dare to deny
her! "The fool saith in his heart--" (<i>He suddenly check himself
and forces a strange, shamefaced laugh.</i>) Say, did you get me
quoting from the Bible, Ada? That's one on me! That comes from
arguing with the old man lately. He's got some fool notion that
Dynamo is the devil. (<i>then his expression abruptly changing
again--fiercely</i>) But I'll make the old fool get down on his
knees to her yet before I'm through with him! And I'll make you,
too, Ada! (<i>This puts a sudden idea into his head--thinking
excitedly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">What made me say that? &hellip; you,
Mother? &hellip; not only conquer her flesh, but convert her?
&hellip; make her pray to you? &hellip;</p>

<p>Listen to me, Ada! To-night the miracle will happen!--and then
there will be only the kingdom of happiness on earth--my
kingdom!--for us, Ada! (<i>then suddenly grabbing her by the
arm</i>) Only you've got to help me!</p>

<p>ADA--(<i>thinking frightenedly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">For God's sake, what's come over him?
&hellip; the damned dynamo! &hellip; it's driving him crazy!
&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>She puts her arms around him pityingly and tries to hug him
to her.</i>) I'll do anything, Rube! Don't you know how much I love
you?</p>

<p>REUBEN--(<i>pushing her away from him--in a stammering
panic</i>) Don't do that! (<i>then pleadingly</i>) Why can't you
understand? You've got to believe in Dynamo, and bow down to her
will!</p>

<p>ADA--(<i>soothingly</i>) All right, Rube.</p>

<p>REUBEN--(<i>taking her hand--insistently</i>) Come with me! I
want to explain everything to you--to prove everything!--all this
plant means about her--you've got to believe in her, Ada! (<i>She
follows him off left, frightened but pitying and resolved to humor
him. His voice is heard explaining excitedly as they climb</i>
<i>to the dam. It recedes and then grows louder as they cross from
the dam to the dynamo-room roof, and a moment later he is seen
there. He comes forward until he stands by the coping, front. He
still has Ada by the hand. She follows him, holding back as much as
she dares, a nervous look on her face. His unnatural excitement has
increased, he looks around him with the rapt expression of one in a
trance.</i>) Oh, Ada, you simply can't help believing in her! You
only have to listen to her! Her song is the hymn of eternal
generation, the song of eternal life!</p>

<p>ADA--(<i>uneasily</i>) Rube! I'm scared up here!</p>

<p>REUBEN--(<i>turns and looks at her like a sleepwalker for a
second--then with a sudden hungry passion</i>) You're so damned
pretty! God, how I wish the miracle was over and we could--!</p>

<p>ADA--(<i>persuasively</i>) I'm scared on this roof, Rube. Let's
go down!</p>

<p>REUBEN--(<i>excitedly</i>) Yes, down to her! I was forgetting
her! She's waiting for me! (<i>Then as she starts to go back the
way they have come, he takes her hand again and pulls her through
the door from the roof to the galleries.</i>)</p>

<p>ADA--(<i>frightenedly</i>) Rube! I don't want to go--(<i>He
slams the door behind them.</i>)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>There is a pause of darkness here to indicate the end of
Scene One. No time elapses between Scenes One and Two.</i>
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name="s302" id="s302">SCENE TWO</a>--<i>When the light comes
on again the interiors of the upper and lower switch galleries are
revealed. The lower gallery of the oil switches is a deep but
narrow compartment with red brick walls. The oil switches, with
their spindly steel legs, their square, crisscrossed steel bodies
(the containers inside looking like bellies), their six cupped arms
stretching upward, seem like queer Hindu idols tortured into
scientific supplications. These switches extend in a straight row
backward down the middle of the gallery, but in the dim light of
one bulb in a bracket in the left wall only the front one in the
foreground can be made out. Against the wall on the right is a
stairway that extends backward halfway up this wall, then turns and
ascends diagonally toward the left to the upper</i> <i>gallery, and
from thence up to the door from the roof of the dynamo
room.</i></p>

<p><i>The upper gallery contains the disconnecting switches and the
double busses. It is of double width and extends over the
switchboard room also. This second gallery, dimly lighted like the
one below, is a fretwork of wires, steel work, insulators, busses,
switches, etc., stretching upward to the roof. Below the
disconnecting switches is a raised platform.</i>
</p>

<p><i>Reuben and Ada are discovered by the dim light of this upper
gallery standing just inside the door to the dynamo-room roof at
the top of the stairway.</i>
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>ADA--(<i>looking around her frightenedly at the weird shadows of
the equipment writhing upward in the dimly lighted
gallery--shrinking close to Reuben, who is staring at all this with
a rapt, questioning, listening look</i>) All this stuff scares me.
I've only seen it in daylight before. It looks as if it was
alive!</p>

<p>REUBEN--(<i>strangely</i>) You're beginning to see, Ada! It is
alive! Alive with the mighty spirit of her eternal life! (<i>Then
with a start, he pushes her away from him roughly.</i>) What the
hell are you doing? Don't press against me, I tell you! I'm wise to
your dirty game--and I won't stand for it! Don't you realize we're
in her temple now!</p>

<p>ADA--(<i>pitifully</i>) Rube! Please don't talk like that--when
you know how I love you!</p>

<p>REUBEN--(<i>clutching her arm fiercely</i>) You mustn't say you
love me in here, you fool you! Don't you know all this is
watching--listening--that she knows everything! Sssh! I want to
hear if she's angry at me! (<i>He stands in a strained attitude of
attention, listening to the dynamo's hum sounding from below--then
evidently satisfied, turns to Ada with a relieved air.</i>) No, she
isn't angry on account of you being here because she knows you're
beginning to believe in her! It's all right for you to come close
to me now, Ada. (<i>He puts an arm around her and pulls her to
him.</i>)</p>

<p>ADA--(<i>persuasively</i>) Please let's go down, Rube.</p>

<p>REUBEN--(<i>gently</i>) All right, Ada. (<i>They go down the
first flight of steps. He stops as they get to the bottom and
glances up and around him.</i>) You know, Ada, there used to be
times when I was scared here too--when all these switches and
busses and wires seemed like the arms of a devil fish--stretching
out to suck me in--(<i>He gives a shudder and presses her to
him.</i>)</p>

<p>ADA--(<i>soothingly</i>) You mustn't be afraid. I'm here with
you.</p>

<p>REUBEN--(<i>pleadingly--pointing to the platform beneath the
disconnecting switches</i>) Listen, Ada! I want you to pray to
her--up there where I pray sometimes--under her arms--with your
arms like her arms, stretching out for me! (<i>He suddenly bends
his face to her face, his eyes devouring it desirously.</i>) God,
you're pretty! (<i>He controls himself with a violent effort and
pushes her away from him, keeping his face averted from hers--in a
voice that is almost supplicating</i>) You must pray that she may
find me worthy. You must pray for me, if you love me!</p>

<p>ADA--(<i>soothingly--humoring him</i>) All right, Rube. (<i>She
goes up the stairs to the platform and stands directly under the
switches, stretching her arms up in the same position as the switch
arms.</i>)</p>

<p>REUBEN--(<i>remains standing below--thinking confusedly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Mother would warn me if I was doing
wrong &hellip; Dynamo means all this to happen to me &hellip; it's
the great temptation &hellip; perhaps she wants me even to kiss Ada
&hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>He ascends to the platform and stands before her.</i>)</p>

<p>ADA--(<i>tenderly and soothingly</i>) Why did you say a minute
ago, if I loved you? Don't you know I do? Why have you stayed away
from me so long, Rube? I've almost died, longing for you!</p>

<p>REUBEN--(<i>without looking at her--dully</i>) You believe in
her now, don't you? You wouldn't do anything to make me unworthy in
her sight, would you?--when it means happiness for me--and for all
mankind? You couldn't, could you?</p>

<p>ADA--(<i>humoring him--gently</i>) Of course not.</p>

<p>REUBEN--(<i>mechanically</i>) You swear to her?</p>

<p>ADA--(<i>in the same tone</i>) Yes, I swear.</p>

<p>REUBEN--(<i>mechanically</i>) Then I'm going to kiss you,
Ada--just once--only kiss you--she wants me to--as a final test--to
prove I'm purified--(<i>He looks up at her now and</i> <i>lurches
forward with a moan of passion and takes her in his arms.</i>) Ada!
(<i>He kisses her frantically, bending her backward and down toward
the floor of the platform. She cries out frightenedly.</i>)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>There is a pause of darkness to indicate the end of Scene
Two. A short time is supposed to elapse between Scenes Two and
Three.</i>
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name="s303" id="s303">SCENE THREE</a>--<i>As the light slowly
comes on again, Reuben is heard sobbing brokenly from the gallery.
The interiors of the dynamo and switchboard rooms are now also
revealed.</i></p>

<p><i>The dynamo room is high and wide with red brick walls and a
row of great windows in the left wall. The floor and an observation
balcony which projects into the dynamo room from the switchboard
room on the right (one story up) are of concrete. The nearest
dynamo, which we have seen previously through the doorway, occupies
most of the floor space in the foreground. A steel ladder runs up
its side on the right to a platform around the exciter.</i>
</p>

<p><i>The switchboard room is a small compartment to the right of
the dynamo room, one story up in the other section of the building.
In it are the switchboard and a couple of chairs. It is lighted by
a shaded drop light over the desk. Jennings, the operator on duty,
a man of thirty or so, is seated at the desk.</i>
</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Fife is sitting in the dynamo room just under and to the
left of the observation balcony. She is staring dreamily at the
front dynamo, humming to herself, her big body relaxed as if she
had given herself up completely to the spell of its hypnotic,
metallic purr which flows insistently through the ears, numbing the
brain, charging the nerves with electricity, making the heart
strain with the desire to beat in its rhythm of unbroken, eternal
continuity.</i>
</p>

<p><i>In the gallery, Ada and Reuben are still on the platform
beneath the disconnecting switches. Reuben is on his knees, his
back bowed, his face covered by his hands. Ada is standing before
him, directly beneath the switches as before. She is bending over
him in a tender attitude, one hand reaching down, touching his
hair.</i>
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>REUBEN--(<i>thinking torturedly</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Mother! &hellip; I've betrayed you
&hellip; you will never bless me with the miracle now! &hellip; you
have shut me from your heart forever! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>He groans and beats his head against the floor.</i>)</p>

<p>ADA--(<i>pats him on the back consolingly</i>) Poor Rube! I love
you. You'll be all right, dear.</p>

<p>REUBEN--(<i>shrinking away</i>) Don't touch me! (<i>He springs
to his feet, and shielding his face with one hand from the sight of
her, runs down the stairs to the lower oil switch gallery. He stops
there, looking around him distractedly as if he didn't know where
to hide, his thoughts hounded by remorse.</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Mother! &hellip; have mercy on me!
&hellip; I hate her now! &hellip; as much as you hate her! &hellip;
give me one more chance! &hellip; what can I do to get you to
forgive me? &hellip; tell me! &hellip; yes! &hellip; I hear you,
Mother! &hellip; and then you'll forgive me? &hellip; and I can
come to you? &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>A terrible look of murder comes on his face. He starts for
the stairs, his hands outstretched as if he were already strangling
her--then stops.</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">No &hellip; not with my hands. &hellip;
Never touch her flesh again &hellip; how? &hellip; I see. &hellip;
Switchboard room &hellip; in the desk. &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>He dashes over into the switchboard room through the door at
left of the gallery. He has the startled and terrified Jennings by
the throat before the latter knows it and flings him away from the
desk, tears out a drawer and gets the revolver and with it motions
him to the door of the office in the rear.</i>) Get in there!
Quick! (<i>Jennings obeys hastily. Reuben turns the key in the lock
after him. In contrast to his furious haste of a moment before, he
now walks deliberately back through the door to the oil switch
gallery. His face is as drained of all human feeling as a plaster
mask.</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">I won't be a murderer &hellip; I'm your
executioner, Mother &hellip; that's why I'm so calm &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>He glides stealthily across toward the foot of the
stairs.</i>)</p>

<p>ADA--(<i>worried about him has come down from the platform and
is beginning to descend the stairs to the lower switch gallery--she
calls uneasily</i>) Rube! Where are you?</p>

<p>REUBEN--</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Harlot! &hellip; that's what Mother
called her! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>He springs up the stairs to her, shouting fiercely</i>)
Harlot!</p>

<p>ADA--(<i>She sees the revolver aimed at her breast as he stops
directly beneath her--in a terrified whisper</i>) Rube! (<i>Reuben
fires twice and she jerks back and pitches sideways on the
stairs.</i>)</p>

<p>REUBEN--(<i>stares down at her body for a moment and lets the
gun fall from his hand and begins to tremble all over. He calls
pitifully</i>) Ada! I didn't mean to hurt you! (<i>then thinking
with an anguished appeal</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em">Mother! &hellip; where are you?
&hellip; I did it for your sake! &hellip; why don't you call to me?
&hellip; don't leave me alone! &hellip;</p>

<p>(<i>He turns and runs headlong through the switchboard room, and
down the stairs to the dynamo-room floor, where he lunges for the
rungs on the dynamo's side and clambers up frenziedly. Up on the
platform, he stops for a moment, gasping for breath, stretching out
his arms to the exciter-head of his Dynamo-Mother with its whirling
metal brain and its blank, oblong eyes.</i>)</p>

<p>MRS. FIFE--(<i>dimly aware of him--dreamily</i>) What was that
noise up there, Reuben? It sounded like a shot.</p>

<p>REUBEN--(<i>pleading to the dynamo like a little boy</i>) I
don't want any miracle, Mother! I don't want to know the truth! I
only want you to hide me, Mother! Never let me go from you again!
Please, Mother! (<i>He throws his arms out over the exciter, his
hands grasp the carbon brushes. There is a flash of bluish light
about him and all the lights in the plant dim down until they are
almost out and the noise of the dynamo dies until it is the
faintest purring hum. Simultaneously Reuben's voice rises in a moan
that is a mingling of pain and loving consummation, and this cry
dies into a sound that is like the crooning of a baby and merges
and is lost in the dynamo's hum. Then his body crumples to the
steel platform and from there falls heavily to the floor. There is
a startled cry from Mrs. Fife as she runs to the body. The dynamo's
throaty metallic purr rises slowly in volume and the lights begin
to come up again in the plant.</i>)</p>

<p>MRS. FIFE--(<i>kneeling beside Reuben, one hand on the forehead
of his upturned face</i>) Reuben! Are you hurt bad? (<i>She turns
with childish bewildered resentment and hurt to the dynamo.</i>)
What are you singing for? I should think you'd be ashamed! And I
thought you was nice and loved us! (<i>The dynamo's purr has
regained its accustomed pitch now. The lights</i> <i>in the plant
are again at their full brightness. Everything is as before. Mrs.
Fife pounds the steel body of the generator in a fit of childish
anger.</i>) You hateful old thing, you! (<i>Then she leaves off,
having hurt her hands, and begins to cry softly.</i>)</p>
